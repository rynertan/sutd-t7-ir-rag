# Phenolic antioxidant compositions for organic polymers.

## Abstract
Substantially colourless, liquid compositions are de scribed which are constituted by a phenolic antioxidant, or mixture of phenolic antioxidants, and at least one phosphine, the compositions being highly resistant to coloration phe nomena. These compositions are effective stabilizers for organic polymers and, when incorporated in the said polymers, have a stabilizing power which is greater than that shown by the phenolic antioxidant or mixture of phenolic antioxidants alone.
