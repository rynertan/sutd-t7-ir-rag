# Glass fiber forming apparatus.

## Abstract
Glass filaments are ejected from a rotating rotor 3 through orifices 4 . A jet of flame 14 causes formation of secondary filaments suitable for forming e. g. glass wool. This jet 14 is also used to heat the lower part of the rotor 3 , using only the outer zone 13 of the flame. The upper part of the rotor 3 is heated by an aux iliary burner 15 whose flame 16 extends along the upper wall 6 of the rotor 3 .
