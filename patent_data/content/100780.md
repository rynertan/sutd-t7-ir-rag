# Method for formation of coating film of silicon oxide.

## Abstract
A method for formation of a coating film of silicon oxide on the surface of an inorganic substrate by applying a coating composition comprising a silicon compound onto the said surface to make a coating composition layer and subjecting the said surface having the coating composition layer to heat treatment to make a coating film of silicon oxide, characterized in that the coating composition compris es a polar organic solvent and silicic acid dissolved therein, the molar ratio of water and silicic acid therein being not more than 5. The coating film formed thereby is uniform and does not show any pinhole or crack.
