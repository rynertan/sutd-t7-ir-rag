# Magnetic recording reproducing apparatus.

## Abstract
A magnetic recording reproducing apparatus for record ing and reproducing a video signal onto and from a recording medium with a magnetic head comprises a recording chrominance signal processing block 23,26 pro vided with a circuit for producing a continuous oscillation signal having the same frequency, gain and phase with those of a normal color burst signal, a switch 35 for normally passing the chrominance signal and, at a period including the normal color burst signal and longer than the duration of the normal color burst signal, passing the continuous oscillation signal, so that at the output of the switch 35 there is obtained a chrominance signal with a duration expanded color burst signal. This chrominance signal is mixed with the frequency converted chrominance signal, and the thus mixed signal is recorded on the recording medium. The duration expanded color burst signal is contracted to the normal duration of color burst signal by a muting circuit 27 in the reproduced chrominance signal processing block.
