# Method of forming a glass or ceramic product.

## Abstract
A method of forming a glass or ceramic product is dis closed by the direct casting of a non aqueous suspension of a particulate oxide such as fumed SiO₂ or Al₂O₃ into a final product configuration, wherein a non aqueous oxide sus pension of limited stability against gelation is cast into shape, permitted to gel, and then dried to provide an inte gral monolith which can be sintered or otherwise processed to clear glass or non porous ceramic product.
