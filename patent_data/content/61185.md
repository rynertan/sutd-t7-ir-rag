# APPARATUS FOR TRIMMING AND SIZING PLASTIC BLANKS FOR CONTAINERS

## Abstract
The invention concerns apparatus for trimming and sizing plastic blanks for containers, particularly for cutting the side walls of half jar molded blanks to predetermined, dimensional requirements so that such blanks will be properly sized for subsequent welding to form containers. The apparatus is comprised of a support 14 for holding a blank 50 and an adjustable cutter assembly 16 adapted to move along the support 14 to cut the side walls 52, 54 of the blank 50 along desired lines in a synchronized manner. The cutter assembly 16 includes two cutting units 90, 92 one for each side wall 52, 54 . Each cutting unit 90, 92 is similar and includes at least two knives 104, 106 that track on the same cut line with the leading knife 104 cutting only partially through the side wall 52 of the blank 50 while the following knife 106 completes the cut. The apparatus includes an end cutting assembly 18 with a cutting unit 150 having two knives. The apparatus also includes means 24 for loading and unloading blanks and a waste ejection assembly 22 for removing the cut portions.
