## Description
Certain substituted 2,6,6 trimethylcyclohexane derivatives and their use in a process for the preparation of damascenone. The present invention relates to a novel process for preparing l crotonoyl 2,6,6 trimethylcylohexa 1,3 diene having the formula EMI1.1 The invention further relates to novel starting materials used in the said process. The compound of formula I, l crotonoyl 2,6,6 trimethyl cyclohexa l,3 diene, is a highly odoriferous compound found in nature as a trace component in several fruits such as, e.g., raspberry, apple and grapes, and several plant species such as deer tongue, tobacco, peppermint and Bulgarian rose, and in beer, wines, and rum. Its organoleptic and olfactory properties make it useful as a component in aromas and perfume compositions and as an aroma additive to foodstuffs, beverages, pharmaceuticals and tobacco products. It is also used in the preparation of synthetic essential oils such as mock orange and rose oil. Because of the growing industrial importance of the compound and its limited availability from natural sources, much attention has been directed to the synthesis of l crotonoyl 2,6,6 trimethylcyclohexa l,3 diene and to the structurally related compounds which are also of industrial interest. The interest in the compound is demonstrated by the numerous methods of preparation which have been reported, e.g., German patent applications 1,807,568, 2,022,216, 2,065,322, 2,065,323, 2,065,324, 2,240,311, 2,242,751, 2,244,680 and 2,305,140 Dutch patent application 75.10914 U.S. patent 3,928,456 Swiss patents 563,326 and 548,967 French patent 2,174,306 Japanese patent applications 74.75556 Chem.Abstr. 82, 124888 1975 and 75.69048 Chem. Abstr. 84, 30532 1976 , Hevl. Chim. Acta 53, 541 1970 , ibid.54, 1767, 1899 1971 , ibid.56, 310, 1503, 1514 1973 , J.C.S.Chem. Commun. 1973, 161 and J.C.S. Perkin Trans. 1,1975, 1727. Most of the synthetic methods described in these references are laboratory methods which are not readily adaptable to profitable commercial use. It is the object of the present invention to provide a method of preparing crotonoyl 2 ,6 , 6 trimethylcyclohexa 1 r3 diene in a technically simple and commercially feasible manner which suppresses the yield of undesirable by products. The process of the invention comprises treating an ester of the formulaEMI2.1 where R is a 1 to 6 carbon alkyl group, a phenyl radical or an alkylphenyl radical, R is hydrogen, hydroxyl orEMI2.2 R is hydrogen or hydroxyl and the dotted lines represent 1 or 2 double bonds, with an essentially anhydrous mineral acid or organic proton acid in an organic solvent capable of forming an azeotrope with water. The esters according to formula ri are novel compounds represented by four species having the general formulae III to VIEMI2.3 EMI3.1 The esters of formula III are prepared by direct acylation of the diol 2,6,6 trimethyl 1 hydroxy l 3 hydroxy but l ynyl cyclohex 2 ene. This diol is a known compound which can be prepared by reacting 2,6,6 trimethyl cyclohex2 ene l one with 3 hydroxy but l yne in the presence of a lithium alkyl, a Grignard reagent, or metallic lithium and ammonia. See, e.g., Japanese patent application 74 75556 orBritish patent 1,335,339. Acylation of the diol is carried out according to known methods such as, e.g., reacting the diol with the corresponding acid anhydride or acid halide under basic conditions.The formation of ester VI appears to take place via an allylic rearrangement of ester III when a basic environment is not provided during acylation. Ester IV is a dehydration product prepared by acid treatment of ester III at elevated temperature. This ester is also found as a by product resulting from a partial dehydration which takes place during the preparation of ester VI. EsterV is formed as a by product resulting from an allylic rearrangement occurring during the preparation of ester III. It is also found as a product resulting from aqueous acid treatment of ester III at room temperature. Specific examples of esters of formulae III to VI include, among others, the following 2,6, 6 tr imethyl l hydroxy l 3 acetoxy but l ynyl cyclohex 2 ene 2,6,6 trimethyl 1 3 acetoxy but 1 ynyl cyclohexa 1, 3 diene 2,6,6 trimethyl 1 3 benzoyloxy but 1 ynyl cyclohexa 1, 3 diene 2,6, 6 tr imethyl l hydroxy l 3 benzoyloxy but 1 ynyl cyclohex 2 ene 2,6,6 trimethyl 3 hydroxy 1 3 acetoxy but 1 ynyl cyclohex l ene 2,6, 6 tr imethyl 3 hydroxy l 3 benzoyloxy but l ynyl cyclohex l ene 2,6,6 trimethyl 3 acetoxy 1 3 acetoxy but 1 ynyl cyclohex l ene 2,6,6 trimethyl 3 benzoyloxy 1 3 benzayloxy but 1 ynyl cyclohex l ene 2,6, 6 tr imethyl l hydroxy l 3 propanoyl but l ynyl cyclohex 2 ene 2,6,6 trimethyl 1 3 propanoyl but 1 ynyl cyclohexa 1,3 diene The esters of formulae III, V and VI are produced as mixtures of diastereoisomers from the corresponding diastereoisomeric diols. The isomer mixtures can be used as such in preparing the desired l crotonoyl 2 , 6 ,6 trimethylcyclohexa 1,3 diene since the product ketone does not exhibit the same diastereoisomerism. Conversion of the esters of formulae III to VI to 1 crotonoyl 2,6,6 trimethylcyclohexa 1,3 diene takes place smoothly and spontaneously by treating them with a catalytic amount of an essentially anhydrous proton acid. The reaction is carried out in an organic solvent which forms an azeotrope with the water generated by the reaction under temperature and reflux conditions such that the water is continuously removed. Acids which can be employed in the reaction are either mineral acids such as phosphoric, nitric and sulfuric acid or organic carboxylic acids such as acetic acid, haloacetic acids, propionic acid, or sulfonic acids such as p toluenesulfonic acid. Acidic agents such as acid cation exchange resins and acidic diatomaceous earth can also be used. Preferred acids are p toluene sulforic acid and phosphoric acid. It is necessary that the acid be essentially anhydrous.In the context of this invention, essentially anhydrous means no more than about 15 by weight water. It is found that in acid of lower concentration, the yield of the desired l crotonoyl 2,6,6 trimethylcyclohexa 1,3 diene is adversely affected due to the presence of water. Relatively small, catalytic amounts of the essentially anhydrous acid are required. About 0.2 to 5 mole of the acid, based on the acetate, is sufficient to accomplish the dehydration and deacylation. As suggested hereinabove, the presence of water during the deacylation and dehydration steps is generally undesirable. In order to remove water from the reaction environment, the reaction is carried out in the presence of a solvent which forms an azeotrope with water at a relatively low temperature.Best results are obtained at temperatures between about 40 and 1100C., and preferably between 40 and 700C. Solvents which form the necessary azeotrope within these temperature limits include, e.g., methylene chloride, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, benzene, and toluene. The invention is illustrated by the following examples.
