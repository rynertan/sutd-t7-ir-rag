# Method and apparatus for providing centrifugal fibre spinning coupled with extrusion.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus wherein there is provided a source 11 of fiber forming material, with said fiber forming material being pumped into a die 23 having a plurality of spinnerets about its periphery. The die 23 is rotated at a predetermined adjustable speed, whereby the liquid is ex pelled from the die 23 so as to form fibers 25 . it is pre ferred that the fiber forming material be cooled as it is leav ing the holes in the spinnerets during drawdown. The fibres 25 may be used to produce fabrics, fibrous tow and yarn through appropriate take up systems. The pumping system 14 provides a pumping action whereby a volumetric quan tity of liquid is forced into the rotational system independent of viscosity or the back pressure generated by the spinner ets and the manifold system of the spinning head, thus creating positive displacement feeding. Positive displace ment feeding may be accomplished by the extruder alone or with an additional pump of the type generally employed for this purpose. A rotary union is provided for positive sealing purposes during the pressure feeding of the fiber forming material into the rotating die 23 .
