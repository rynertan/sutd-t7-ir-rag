# Polymer composition.

## Abstract
The invention relates to an impact resistant polymer composition on the basis of a copolymer of an unsaturated nitrile, a substantially saturated ruttber and a chlorinated polyethylene. To improve the impact resistance of the polymer composition while retaining the good processing properties, the polymer composition according to the invention is characterized in that the polymer composition comprises a. 30 95 parts by weight of one or more polymers obtained by polymerizing a mixture of 10 90 wt. styrene and or styrene derivates and 90 10 wt. acrylonitrile and or methacrylonitrile, b. 5 70 parts by weight of b.1. a substantially saturated rubber, and b.2. a chlorinated polyethylene with a chlorine content of between 32 and 45 wt. , a DSC crystallinity of 0.7 and an intrinsic viscosity of at least 1.0, the weight ratio between rubber and chlorinated polyethylene being between 2 1 and 1 10.
