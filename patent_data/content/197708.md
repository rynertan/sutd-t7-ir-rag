# DIGITAL ZERO IF CIRCUIT

## Abstract
A digital zero IF circuit having first and second signal paths 11I, 11Q to which a radio frequency signal is applied, each path including a sampling and digitising means 12I, 12Q and a digital filter means 13I, 13Q, the circuit including a clock generator arranged to generate two clock pulse trains in quadrature phase relationship, each sampling means being operated in response to a respective one of the clock pulse trains.
