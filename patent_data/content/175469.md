## Description
Conduit connection device and system This invention relates to a connection device for securing the ends of conduits having mating end flanges, the connection device being of the kind comprising flange clamping means including at least one movable element arranged to be positioned in an operative position in which the flange clamping means clamp the mating end flanges of the conduits together and power operable moving means for moving said at least one movable element out of its operative position to enable disconnection of the mating end flanges and to a conduit connection system. A connection device of the kind referred to is disclosed in GB A 2O39589. However, this known connection device is not provided with any means to lock the flange clamping means in position and to prevent the flange clamping means from being opened by the power operable moving means at undesirable times. According to one aspect of the invention, a connection device of the kind referred to is characterised in that it further comprises locking means movable between a first position to prevent said at least one movable element being moved out of its operative position by said power operable moving means and a second position in which movement of said at least one movable element to enable disconnection of the mating end flanges is possible. A connection device according to the invention provides a safety release system for decoupling a pair of conduits, e.g. for transfer of fluid oil products, whose end flanges are connected in mating engagement. Ideally the connection device is designed to connect conduits having fluid flow check valves positioned, for example, adjacent the end flanges. In this case the locking means is suitably arranged to occupy its first position whenever the check valves are open so that the power operable means cannot be operated to decouple the conduits when fluid is flowing through the conduits. When the check valves are closed the locking means is preferably automatically moved into its second position to enable safe decoupling of the conduits. In its broadest aspect the invention is intended to cover many different types of connection device for clamping mating conduit end flanges together and which employ a movable element which can be locked in an operative position by locking means. However, the invention is particularly applicable to band clamp connection devices of the type comprising a collar having at least two collar segments each provided with means for securing said mating end flanges together when urged radially inwards, pivot means for pivotally interconnecting said collar segments between opposite first and second end portions of the collar and first and second connection means, one of which constitutes the said movable element, mounted, respectively, adjacent, said first and second end portions of the collar and interengageable with each other for clamping said first and second end portions together so that said collar segments are urged radially inwards against the mating end flanges. Preferably the locking means is movable between its first and second positions by actuating means, e.g.power actuating means such as an hydraulic cylinder.Typically the locking means comprises a release pin fixed relative to, so as to be moved by, a piston of a hydraulic cylinder which is mounted adjacent the movable element of the flange clamping means. Conveniently the first and second connection means each have apertures therein which are aligned with each other when the connection means are interengaged, the said locking means, when in its first position, being inserted through the aligned apertures. Typically the locking means is withdrawn completely from the aligned apertures when moved into its second position. Alternatively, however, the locking means may be in the form of a pin having at least one weakened region, the pin being designed to be sheared, at said at least one weakened region, by movement of the first connection means when the locking means is in its second position. Suitably one of the first and second connection means is retained in a position of interengagement with the other connection means by a removable shear pin.The shear pin is designed to shear in use if the poweroperable means is operated with the shear pin in its operative position and the locking means in its second position. According to a further aspect of the invention a connection system for securing the ends of conduits having mating end flanges and each provided with a fluid flow check valve, comprises a connection device according to said one aspect of the present invention and means for positioning the locking means in dependence on the condition of at least one of said check valves, the locking means occupying its first position when the at least one check valve is open and occupying its second position when the at least one check valve is closed. Conveniently the locking means is moved between its first and second positions by power means, e.g.hydraulic cylinder means, operable only when said at least one check valve is open. Alternatively the locking means is connected via linkage means to an actuator for actuating said at least one fluid flow check valve, the locking means being movable between its first and second positions on actuation of the actuator to open or close the at least one valve. Embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a side view of one embodiment of a conduit connection system according to the invention, Figure 2 is a partly sectioned plan of the connection system shown in Figure 1, the sectional part being taken on the line II II of Figure 1, Figure 3 is a section taken on the line III III of Figure 1, Figure 4 is a partial end view of a second embodiment of a conduit connection system according to the invention, Figure 5 is a sectional view, on an enlarged scale, of part of the conduit connection system shown in Figure 4, Figure 6 is a side view of a third embodiment of a conduit connection system according to the invention, Figure 7 is a sectional view taken on the line VIIVII of Figure 6, Figures 8 and 9 are views from below and from one side, respectively, of a fourth embodiment of a conduit connection system according to the invention, Figure 10 is a view, on an enlarged scale, taken on the line X X of Figure 8 but not showing the conduits or valves thereof, Figure 11 is a sectional view, on an enlarged scale, of the release pin actuating assembly of the conduit connection system shown in Figures 8 and 9, and Figure 12 is a view, on an enlarged scale, taken on the line XII XII of Figure 11. Figures 1 to 3 show a conduit connection system for connecting together two pipe sections 1 and 2 so that end flanges 45 one of which can be seen in Figure 3 of the pipe sections 1 and 2 are held in leak tight mating engagement. The pipe sections 1 and 2 include fluid flow check valves in the form of ball valves generally designated 3 and 4, respectively. The ball valves 3 and 4 have valve elements not shown turnable by means of shafts 5 and 6, respectively.The shaft 6 is turned by means of a semi rotary actuator 8 controlled by a double acting hydraulic cylinder 9.A linkage, generally designated 7, connects the shafts 6 and 7 so that turning of the shaft 6 about its axis by the actuator 8 produces a similar turning movement of the shaft 5 about is own axis. In Figures 1 and 2 the ball valves 3 and 4 are shown in open positions for allowing flow of fluid through the pipe sections 1 and 2. Rotation of the shafts 5 and 6 through approximately 900 in counter clockwise directions as viewed in Figure 2 moves the valve elements into closed positions. The end flanges 15 of the pipe sections 1 and 2 are held in mating engagement by means of a bandclamp type collar generally designated 10. The collar 10 comprises three channel section, flange clamping segments 11, 12 and 13 and link elements 14 and 16 for pivotally connecting together segments 11 and 12 and segments 12 and 13, respectively. Connection means, generally designated 17 and 18, are provided at opposite ends of the collar 10 for releasably connecting the collar segments together. The connection means 17 comprises a pair of axially spaced apart, circumferentially extending brackets 9 and 20 mounted on the segment 11 and having mounted therebetween a fixed locking pin 21. The connection means 18 comprises a pair of axially spaced apart circumferentially extending brackets 22 and 23 mounted on the segment 13. Between the brackets 22 and 23 there is arranged a pivotable locking member 24 which is pivotally mounted on a pivot pin 25 carried by, and extending between, the brackets 22 and 23, and which is provided with a hookshaped end 26. A hydraulic emergency release ram 27 is mounted on the collar 10, one end of the ram 27 being pivotally connected to a mounting 28 provided on the segment 13 at its end remote from the brackets 22 and 23 and the other end of the ram 27 being pivotally connected to the locking member 24. In the unextended position shown in Figures 1 to 3 of the ram 27, the hook shaped end 26 of the locking member 24 interengages with the fixed locking pin 21 to hold the collar 10 in a closed or locked position in which the segments 11 13 are urged radially inwards. Each of the segments 11 13 has wedging surfaces not shown forming part of its inner channel shaped surface and these wedging surfaces tend to urge the flanges 15 axially together into liquid tight mating engagement when the segments 11 13 are urged radially inwards. The brackets 22 and 23 are formed with an aligned pair of upper holes 30 only one of which can be seen in Figure 3 and an aligned pair of smaller diameter lower holes 31 only one of which can be seen in Figure 3 . When the hook shaped end 26 of the locking member is interengaged with the locking pin 21, two further holes not shown provided in the locking member 24 are respectively aligned with the holes 30 and 31. This enables a release pin 32 to be positioned within the through hole defined by the bracket holes 30 and the associated aligned hole formed in the locking member 24 and a smaller diameter shear pin 33 to be positioned within the through hole defined by the bracket holes 31 and the associated aligned hole formed in the locking member 24. The release pin 32 is displaceable between an inserted position shown in Figures 1 3 and a withdrawn position the end of the pin 32 is shown in dotted lines in Figures 1 and 2 by actuation of an hydraulic cylinder 35. The pin 32 is connected to the hydraulic cylinder 35 via an interlock plate 36 having a keyhole shaped opening 37 with an enlarged circular portion 38 and a narrower elongate portion 39. The shaft 6, for actuation of the valve element of the ball valve 4, passes through the opening 37 and is provided with a pair of opposed parallel flats 40 on its circular cylindrical surface in the region of the plate 36. In the position of the shaft 6 shown in Figures 1 3 i.e. when the ball valves 3 and 4 are open , the interlock plate 36 is locked in the position shown in Figures 1 to 3 with the shaft 6 located in the circular portion 38 of the opening 37.When so positioned, the release pin is in its inserted position. On closing the ball valves 3 and 4, the shaft 6 is turned counterclockwise as viewed in Figure 2 through 900 so that the flats 40 are disposed parallel with the elongate sides of the portion 39 of the opening 37. On subsequent actuation of the hydraulic cylinder 35, the interlock plate 36 is now able to move to the right as viewed in Figure 2 , causing the shaft 6 to be located in the elongate portion 39 of the keyholeshaped opening 37 and the release pin 32 to be moved out of its inserted position and into its withdrawn position. When the pin 32 is in its inserted position, the locking member 24 is locked against pivotal movement about pivot pin 25. The release pin 32 is designed so as not to shear even on actuation of the emergency release ram 27 so that the collar 10 cannot be opened if the release pin 32 is in its inserted position. When the release pin 32 is in its withdrawn position, the shear pin 33 prevents accidental pivotal movement of the locking member 24 about the pivot pin 25. During a normal de coupling procedure for disconnecting the pipe sections 1 and 2, the shear pin 33 is removed, e.g.manually, to allow pivotal movement of the locking member 24. In an emergency, however, the ram 27 can be actuated with the shear pin 33 still in its inserted position.Actuation of the ram 27 causes the pin 33 to shear and the locking member 24 to pivot about the pivot pin 25 so that the hook shaped end 26 becomes disengaged from the fixed locking pin 21 enabling the collar 10 to open. It will be appreciated from the foregoing description that the release pin 32 is always in its inserted position when the ball valves 3 and 4 are open and thus the pipe sections 1 and 2 cannot be disconnected when the valves are open with fluid flowing through the pipe sections. Figures 4 and 5 illustrate another embodiment of a conduit connection system according to the invention employing a collar 110 having three segments 111, 112 and 113 pivotally connected together in a similar manner to that previously described with reference to collar 10 and provided with an emergency release ram 127. Connection means generally designated 117 and 118, are provided on the segments 111 and 113, respectively.The connection means 117 comprises a pair of brackets 119 mounted on the segment 111 and a member 120 carrying a locking pin 121. The member 120 is pivotally mounted between the brackets 119 for pivotal movement about a pivot pin 140 fixed between, and carried by, the brackets 119. However in normal use the member 120 is retained in a fixed position by means of a shear pin 170 carried by the brackets 119 and passing through a hole not shown provided in the member 120. The connection means 118 comprises a pair of brackets 122 and 123 mounted on the segment 113 and a locking member 124 pivotally connected to the ram 127. The locking member 124 is pivotally mounted between the brackets 122 and 123 for pivotal movement about a pivot pin 125 fixed between, and carried by, the brackets 122 and 123.The locking member 124 is also provided with a hole 141 and a hook shaped end 126 which interengages with the locking pin 121 to lock the collar segments 111 and 113 together and lock the collar 110 in a closed position. The hole 141 is positioned so as to be aligned with a pair of aligned holes 130 and 142, formed in the brackets 122 and 123, respectively, when the locking member 124 is in its locking position shown in Figure 4. A release pin 132 is movable between first and second positions within the aligned holes 130, 141 and 142 in dependence on the position of fluid flow check valves not shown positioned adjacent the flanged ends of pipe sections not shown to be connected to or disconnected from each other. As can be seen in Figure 5, the release pin 132 is mounted for sliding movement in a support 150 and is pivotally connected to a link 151 by means of a pivot pin 152. The link 151 is pivotally connected, by means of a pivot pin 153, to a further link 154 fixed to a shaft 155 of a disc valve actuator 156 for actuating the fluid flow check valves not shown . The release pin 132 is provided with a pair of annular recesses 157 and 158 which are spaced apart substantially the same distance as the brackets 122 and 123 are spaced from each other and which define weakened regions of the release pin 132. The valve actuator 156 is movable in a counterclockwise direction as viewed in Figure 5 from a valve open or first position, in which the link 154 is aligned along the chain line 160, through a valve closed or second position, in which the link 154 is aligned along the dotted line 161, to an over travel valve closed or third position, in which the link 154 is aligned along the dashed line 162. In Figure 5 the position of the pivot pin 152 is represented, in each of the first, second and third positions of the valve actuator 156, by chain line 165, dotted line 166 and dashed line 167, respectively, and the first and second positions of the release pin 132 for the first and third positions, respectively, of the actuator 156 are represented by chain lines and full lines, respectively. When the fluid flow check valves not shown are open i.e. the disc valve actuator is in its first position and the release pin 132 thus occupies its first position, the release pin 132 prevents pivotal movement of the locking member 124 on actuation of the ram 127.As the disc valve actuator 156 is turned in the counterclockwise direction as viewed in Figure 5 , the release pin moves to the right from its first position towards its second position. To ensure that the disc valves are fully closed and sealed, the actuator 156 is turned past the valve closed position and into the final over travel position. In this final over travel position of the disc valve actuator 156, the release pin 132 occupies its second position in which the annular recesses 157 and 158 are positioned at the interfaces between the locking member 124 and the brackets 122 and 123, respectively. When, and only when, the release pin 132 is so positioned in its second position, the pin 132 can be sheared by operation of the ram 127 to pivot the locking member 124 and disengage the latter from the member 120. A third embodiment of a conduit connection system according to the invention is shown in Figures 6 and 7. The system shown in Figures 6 and 7 is similar in many respects to that shown in Figures 1 to 3 and, where possible, the same reference numerals have been used to identify similar parts of the two systems. The main difference in the system shown in Figures 6 and 7 is in the operation of the release pin 32. In particular the release pin 32 is movable between an inserted position shown in full lines in Figure 6 and a withdrawn position shown in dotted lines in Figure 6 by actuation of a double acting semi rotary actuator 200 which also operates the opening and closing of the ball valves 3 and 4. In the system shown in Figures 6 and 7, the mating end flanges 15 of pipe sections 1 and 2 can only be decoupled when the ball valves 3 and 4 are closed so that the release pin 32 is in its withdrawn position. Operation of the emergency release ram 27 with the pin 32 in its withdrawn position causes the pin 33 to shear and the locking member 24 to pivot about pivot pin 25 into an open position shown in dotted lines in Figure 7 . A fourth embodiment of a conduit connection system according to the invention is shown in Figures 8 to 12.The system shown in Figures 8 to 12 is similar in many respects to the other systems described herein and, where possible, the same reference numerals have been used to identify similar system parts. The main difference between the system shown inFigures 8 to 12 and that shown in Figures 6 and 7 is in the construction and operation of the release pin actuating assembly 40 see in particular Figures 11 and 12 . This mechanism 40 comprises a housing 41 through which the ball valve actuating shaft 6 projects and an hydraulic cylinder 42 mounted on the housing 41 with its axis parallel to a line perpendicular to the axis of the shaft 6. An actuator 43 is keyed to the shaft 6 by means of a key 44 and has a pair of spaced apart, parallel arms 45 and 46 extending parallel to a radius of the shaft 6 and provided with open slots 47 and 48, extending radially with respect to the shaft 6. A piston not shown is housed within the cylinder 42 and has a piston rod 49 connected thereto which projects into the housing 41.At the end of the piston rod 49 remote from the piston, there is provided a release pin 50, forming an extension of the piston rod 49, and two pairs of rolls 51, 52 and 53, 54 rotatably mounted adjacent the end of the piston rod 49 on a fixed transverse pin 55. The end portion of the piston rod 49 is positioned between the two actuator arms 45 and 46 with the rolls 52 and 54 received in the slots 47 and 48, respectively, and the rolls 51 and 53 received in elongate slots 56 and 57, respectively, formed in the housing 41 and extending parallel to the axis of the cylinder 42. In use, the free end of the release pin 50 is positionable in a first position A, a second position B or an intermediate third position C, the three positionsA, B and C being shown in chain lines in Figure 11.When the ball valves 3, 4 are open, the shaft 6 and the actuator 43 are in the positions shown in full lines in Figure 11 with the release pin 50 in its fully extended, first position A. In position A, the pin 50 is in a collar locking position preventing collar release. When the hydraulic cylinder 42 is actuated to close the ball valves, the piston rod 49 moves to the right in Figure 11, drawing the actuator 43 through a 900 turn, to adopt the position shown in dotted lines in Figure 11. The shaft 6 is also turned in a clockwise direction as viewed in Figure 11 through 900 closing the valve 4 and via the linkage 7, the valve 3 .During the i turn rotation of the actuator 43 the rolls 52 and 54 are guided in the slots 47 and 48, respectively,and the rolls 51 and 53 are guided along the elongate slots 56 and 57, respectively. When the actuator 43 is in the position shown in dotted lines inFigure 11,the release pin 50 is partially retracted in its intermediate or third position C. In position C, the pin 50 still projects sufficiently far to be in a collarlocking position preventing collar release. Opening and closing of the valves 3, 4 is thus accomplished with the interlock pin 50 moving between positions A and C. However, the actuator 43 is so positioned that the slots 47 and 48 open towards the cylinder 42 allowing further retraction of the piston rod 49. Thus, when the release pin 50 is in position C, the cylinder 42 can be actuated again to retract fully the piston rod 49 so that the release pin 50 is moved into its second position B in which it is completely withdrawn from the collar so that the collar can be opened to disconnect the mating end flanges 15 of the pipe sections 1 and 2. The conduit connection system shown in Figures 8 to 12 has a number of additional features not shown in the previously described systems. In particular a release pin sensing mechanism 60 see Figure 11 is mounted at the rear end of the housing 41 and has a sensing element 61 positioned so as to be depressed by roll 54 when the release pin 50 is in its second position B. Actuation of the cylinder 42 is thus ceased when the sensing mechan ism 60 senses that the release pin is in its second position B. A further sensing mechanism shown dotted at 60 in Figure 11 similar to the mechanism 60, can be provided to arrest the cylinder 42 when the pin 50 has reached the intermediate position C. The sensing element of this further sensing mechanism 60 would be depressed by the valve actuating lever 43 when it moves into its position shown in dotted lines in Figure 11. If collar release is required, then the stop provided by the mechanism 60 is overridden and the cylinder 42 reactuated to complete the withdrawal of the pin 50 to the second position B. A still further sensing mechanism 70 see Figures 8, 9 and 10 is provided for sensing actuation of the cylinder 27 indicating that the hook shaped end 26 of the locking member 24 has been disconnected from the locking pin 21. Although the invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments employing bandclamp type collars for connecting together flanged ends of pipes, the invention is not intended to be so limited. Indeed the invention is applicable to other types of connectors, e.g. connectors employing pivoting and or sliding clamping hooks, for connecting pipe flanges together which employ a release member, e.g. a release pin.
