## Description
PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF GLYCOL ALDEHYDE AND THE PRODUCTION OF ETEYIENE GLYCOL TEEREFRDM This invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of glycol aldehyde and a process for the production of ethylene glycol from the glycol aldehyde thus prepared. It has been disclosed in the past that glycol aldehyde, which is a useful intermediate for the preparation of ethylene glycol, can be prepared by the reaction of formaldehyde with carbon monoxide and hydrogen in the presence of a cobalt catalyst. Other prior disclosures teach that this same chemical reaction can be carried out using a rhodium catalyst instead of a cobalt catalyst. These prior art processes suffer from the disadvantage that much methanol is produced as a result of the hydrogenation of formaldehyde which proceeds as a side reaction. In order to suppress the methanol production to a reasonable level, the prior art processes use very high pressures in addition, they use carbon moncxide hydrogen gas mixtures with a relatively high carbon monoxide content. The Applicants have described and claimed in a co pending application that the production of glycol aldehyde in this type of process, when using either a cobalt or a rhodium catalyst, can be improved by the addition to the reaction mixture of a catalytic amount of a strong protonic acid. In particular, the quantity of methanol formed can be much reduced. They have now surprisingly found that very high selectivities 90 with respect to glycol aldehyde together with very high yields calculated on formaldehyde intake well over 80 can be obtained when use is made of certain acids together with a particular class of promoters. It is known from prior art literature referred to hereinbefore that protic solvents such as water, phenols and carboxylic acids can be used primarily to facilitate hydrolysis of unwanted acetals co produced , but the use of lower alkanoic acids such as acetic acid is clearly disadvantageous in that, although the reaction proceeds at a higher rate, lower yields of glycol aldehyde are produced, particularly when rather high amounts of such protic solvents are used. It is stated explicitly in a prior art reference concerned that protic solvents in significant amounts are usually avoided when optimum yields of glycol aldehyde and ethylene glycol and minimum yields of methanol are desired. It has now been found that certain acids, in particular certain carboxylic acids can be used advantageously in the process for the preparation of glycol aldehyde from formaldehyde, carbon monoxide and hydrogen when use is made of promoters XR3 wherein at least one of R represents an aryl group containing one or more electron withdrawing groups. It is remarkable that only the combined presence of certain acids as defined hereinafter and promoters containing aryl groups substituted in such a way that in total an electron withdrawing effect results, causes the production of glycol aldehyde with both high yield and high selectivity.In the absence of an acid the yield drops to about 5 and in the presence of unsubstituted m promoters such as triphenylphosphine both the selectivity and the yield are moderate at best. Admittedly, the use of substituted triphenylphosphines has been proposed before but there is nothing in that proposal to suggest the use of specifically substituted arylphosphines together with carboxylic acids, let alone the un expected and substantial improvement in yield and selectivity. The present invention therefore provides a process for the preparation of glycol aldehyde which comprises reacting formaldehyde with hydrogen and carbon monoxide, in the presence of a catalyst system derived from a rhodiumrcontaining catalyst precursor and or a cobalt containing catalyst precursor and an acid having a PKa 3.5 and a promoter XR3, X representing P,As or Sb and each R representing a dis similar substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbyl group, at least one R representing an aryl group containing one or more electron withdrawing groups. The catalyst precursor used in the process according to the invention camprises rhodium and or cobalt in any form generally used in catalytic reactions. The precursor may for example be a salt of rhodium or cobalt with a mineral acid, for example a halide, nitrate or sulphate, or with an organic acid, for example a carboxylate having up to 20 carbon atoms, especially alkanoate, such as an acetate. Alternatively, the metal may be in zerovalent form, optionally complexed by ligand such as substituted phosphine ligands, carbon monoxide or acetylacetonates.Frequently both anions and uncharged ligands are present, e.g. as in Rh.Cl CO 2 2.The precise form of the active catalyst in the process of the invention is not known in sate cases it is believed that the rhodium or cobalt containing catalyst precursor added to the reaction mixture will itself function directly as a catalyst, in other cases it is believed that it will be converted into an active form in situ. The quantity of rhodium or cobalt present in the reaction mixture is generally determined by economic considerations.Quantities of rhodium plus cobalt of between 0.001 to 10 , especially 0.01 to 5 , calculated as gram atoms of metal per mole of formaldehyde used as feedstock, are generally suitable.Generally rhodium is more active as a catalyst than cobalt, but the use of cobalt may be desirable because of its relatively low cost. In certain cases, a catalyst system containing both rhodium and cobalt may be useful. The process according to the present invention has to be carried out in the presence of acids having a PKa of at least 3.5 at room temperature, preferably between 3.5 and 11. A suitable class of acids comprises aliphatic monocarboxylic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, protionic acid, butyric acid, isobutyric acid, caproic acid, isocaproic acid, pivalic acid and valeric acid aliphatic dicarboxylic acids having at least two carbon atoms between the carboxylic moieties such as adipic acid and succinic acid aromatic carboxylic acids such as benzoic acid, a naphthoic acid, ss naphthoic acid, phthalic acid, ciscinnamic acid and trans cinnamic acid as well as various substituted carboxylic acids having a PKa of at least 3.5 such as acetoacetic acid, p chlorobenzoic acid and m aminobenzoic acid and unsaturated carboxylic acids such as acrylic acid, inetha crylic acid and trans crotonic acid. Preference is given to aliphatic monocarboxylic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid and the butyric acids in particular good results have been obtained using acetic acid. It should be noted that carboxylic acids containing substituents which are susceptible to reaction with carbon monoxide and or hydrogen can be used as long as the acid function therein is maintained. Another class of suitable acids camprises partially esterified acids having a pK of at least 3.5 at room temperature. The partially esterified acids may comprise both inorganic and organic acids. Examples of partially esterified inorganic acids comprise mona and di alkyl or di aryl substituted phosphoric acids such as dimethyl phosphate, diethyl phosphate, diphenyl phosphate, methyl ethyl phosphate and methyl phenyl phosphate.Also partially esterified boric and tetraboric acids can be used. Examples of partially esterified organic acids ccmprise the mona esters of aliphatic dicarboxylic acids having at least two carbon atoms between the carboxyl moieties such as methyl adipate, ethyl succinate, t butyl adipate and phenyl succinate as well as the partially esterified aromatic polycarboxylic acids such as methyl phthalate, ethyl phthalate, t butylphthalate, methyl terephthalate and ethyl terephtalate. A further class of suitable acids having a pK or the equivalent thereof of at least 3.5 at room temperature comprises solid organic acids or solid partially esterified polyacids which are of the macroreticular type, i.e. acids bound to or forming part of a polymeric structure. Examples of such type of compounds comprise the so called Duolites such as Duolite C434H , DuoliteC436H and Duolite C464H . The word Duolite is a RegisteredTrade Mark. Also other solid acids which are known in the art can be used. Also phenolic compounds having an aromatic carbon hydroxyl bond can be used as acids in the process according to the present invention. Examples comprise phenol, a naphthol, S naphthol cresols such as hydrochinone, resorcinol, and pyrocatechol monohalophenols such as mchlorophenol, m bromophenol, p chlorophenol, p brcmophenol dihalophenols such as 2, 3 dichlorophenol nitrophenols and dinitrophenols such as 2,4 dinitrophenol and 3, 6 dinitrophenol. Good results have been obtained using phenol as an example of phenolic compounds which can be used advantageously. The amount of acid having a pKa of at least 3.5 is not very critical and may vary between rather wide limits provided that one or more promoters according to the general formula are also present. Acids in an amount of up to 50 v on total liquid volume can be used, preference being given to acids in an amount between 5 and 30 v, in particular between 5 and 20 v. The formaldehyde starting material may be introduced into the reaction zone in any suitable form, and it may be generated in situ. Paraformaldehyde is a convenient source. Commercial formaldehyde often contains varying quantities of either methanol or water, depending on how the material has been synthesised, and the process according to the invention can be carried out successfully using such feedstocks. The molar ratio of the carbon monoxide to hydrogen supplied to the system is not critical and may vary over a wide range, for example 5 95 to 95 5, preferably 30 70 to 80 20. It is generally preferred to use a gas stream in which the molar ratio of CO H2 is at least 1 1, since under such conditions the hydrogenation of formaldehyde to methanol is minimized. The reaction is conducted under pressure, for example at a pressure in the range of fram 5 to 200, especially 25 to 80, bars. Higher pressures may of course be used, but are generally uneconomical, and it is one of the advantages of the present invention that it enables relatively low pressures to be used. Inert gases may also be present in the gas stream, but as this leads to an increase in total pressure it is generally undesirable.The reaction is preferably conducted at a temperature in the range of fran 30 to 2000C, especially 50 to 130 cm. The use of a temperature as low as possible ccmmensurate with the desired rate of reaction is preferred, since at much higher temperatures the glycol aldehyde product tends to polymerize. The process according to the invention is suitably carried out in the additional presence of a solvent. Details of suitable solvents for reactions of this kind may be found in the prior art indicated hereinbefore. Solvents having multiple bonds from carbon to other atoms, for example as in nitriles or pyridine, are generally suitable. N,N disubstituted amides have proved to be especially suitable solvents, optionally in admixture with co solvents. If it is desired to extract the glycol aldehyde product fram the reaction mixture using water, it is convenient to use a water immiscible amide as solvent. Suitable water imaiscible amides are those containing long chain alkyl moieties.Alternatively, if an amide which is wholly or partially miscible with water is used, for example N,N dimethylformamide, N,N di methylasetamide or a cyclic amide such as N methylpyrrolidone, it may be convenient to use a water immiscible co solvent such as benzene. In this case, extraction by water removes the glycol aldehyde together with at least sane of the amide, leaving the rhodium or cobalt in solution in the hydrophobic co solvent. The process according to the present invention has to be carried out in the presence of a promoter according to the general formula XR3 wherein X represents a phosphorus, arsenic or antimony moiety and each R represents a dis similar substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbyl group, at least one R representing an aryl group containing one or more electronwithdrawing groups. Examples of compounds according to the general formula XR3 are those wherein X represents a phosphorus atom and at least one R represents an aryl group containing one or more electron withdrawing groups in the ortho, metha or para positions. Examples of electron withdrawing groups comprise halogen moieties, tri halanethyl groups, nitro groups and alkoxy or aryloxy groups.Preference is given to compounds according to the general formula XR3 wherein each group R is similar and contains at least one electron withdrawing group.Examples of such compounds comprise tri p fluorophenyl phoshine, tri pchlorophenyl phosphine, tri bromophenyl phosphine, tri iodophenyl phosphine, tri fluorophenyl phosphine, tri miodophenyl phosphine, tri o chlorophenyl phosphine, tri o bromo phenyl phosphine tri p nitrophenyl phosphine, tri m nitrophenyl phosphine, tri m methoxyphenyl phosphine, tri m ethoxyphenyl phosphine, tri m t.butoxyphenyl phosphine and tri m phenoxyphenyl phosphine. very good results have been obtained using tri p chlorophenyl phosphine and tri p branophenyl phosphine. It is also possible to use compounds according to the general formula XR3 wherein one or two of R represent a group CH2 nXR2 wherein n is an integer of up to 6 and X and R are as defined hereinbefore. Examples of such compounds include bis tetra p chlorophenyl phosphinomethane, b is tetra p branophenyl phosphinoethane and bis di pchlorophenyl diphenyl phosphino propane. It should be noted that two or more electron withdrawing substituents may be present in the hydrocarbyl or aryl groups such as in the 3,4 dichlorophenyl group, the 3 fluoro 4 chlorophenyl group or the 2,6 dinitro 4 trifluoramethyl phenyl group.It is also possible that the aryl groups contain further substituents which exert an electron donating effect provided that the overall effect of the substituents in the aryl group results in an electron withdrawing effect in other words that the Hammett substituent constant a, or the combined values of the respective Hammett a values, as the case may be, is at least 0.1 see, for reference, J.Hine McGraw Hill Book CoNpany, 1962,Second Edition, page 87 . The amount of promoter used is not critical. The ratio of promoter to catalyst is preferably in the range of from 1 1 to 100 1, especially 2 1 to 20 1, calculated as moles of promoter per gram atom of rhodium plus cobalt. When promoters are applied which contain two X moieties, smaller amounts thereof are already sufficient. The main use of glycol aldehyde is its conversion to ethylene glycol by catalytic hydrogenation. Under certain reaction conditions, scme or all of the glycol aldehyde prepared by the process according to the invention may be hydrogenated in situ over the rhodium or cobalt catalyst to produce ethylene glycol, and the present invention should be understood to include the production of ethylene glycol as just mentioned. In general, however, reaction conditions which tend to favour the hydrogenation of glycol aldehyde immediately it is formed, tend also to favour the hydrogenation of the formaldehyde starting material to methanol. Usually therefore the highest overall yields of ehtylene glycol are obtained by preparing glycol aldehyde under reaction conditions which minimize hydrogenation, and subsequently hydrogenating the glycol aldehyde product in a second reaction step. The rhodium or cobalt catalyst systems used in the process of the present invention are relatively inefficient hydrogenation catalysts, and it is preferred to use a more active hydrogenation catalyst for the subsequent hydrogenation step. Such catalysts are well known for example palladium, platinum or nickel catalysts, often in heterogeneous form, are catrtonly used. The selected hydrogenation catalyst may be added directly to the reaction mixture after completion of the preparation of glycol aldehyde with no work up procedure and gaseous hydrogen introduced. Hydrogen gas which is free from substantial quantities of carbon monoxide is of course a preferred reactant when using a hydrogenation catalyst which is poisoned by carbon monoxide.Alternatively, the reaction mixture resulting from the preparation of glycol aldehyde may be worked up before the glycol aldehyde is hydrogenated. For example the glycol aldehyde may be extracted using a suitable solvent. As described above, water is a convenient extractant. A further convenient extractant is ethylene glycol itself. The resulting solution may then be hydrogenated in conventional manner. The following Examples illustrate the invention.Examples All the Examples were carried out using the following general method. A Hastelloy C Trade Mark 300 ml magnet driven autoclave was charged with 0.25 mol formaldehyde in the form of paraformaldehyde, 50 ml of the chosen solvent and the necessary catalyst components. The autoclave was then flushed with carbon monoxide and pressurized to a working pressure of 60 bars with a 1 1 molar carbon monoxide hydrogen mixture. The pressure was maintained throughout the reaction by feeding in the CO H2 mixture as required. After the required reaction temperature and pressure had been maintained for the required reaction time, the contents of the autoclave were cooled and analysed using gasliquid chromatography.
