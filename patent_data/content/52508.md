# Process for producing hydroxyapatite.

## Abstract
Hydroxyapatite tricalcium phosphate is produced by a process in which a slurry of calcium oxide in water and a solution of phosphoric acid in water are continuously charged to the first stage of a two stage reactor, the calcium oxide and the phosphoric acid are allowed to react in said first stage under vigorous agitation at a pH such that the viscosity of the reaction mass is near minimum viscosity, the reaction is continued in the second stage of the reactor under vigorous agitation while continuously charging additional solution of phosphoric acid thereto in an amount sufficient to maintain the pH in said second stage at about 7.0 to about 7.4, and a suspension of tricalcium phosphate is continuous ly removed from said second stage.
