# Multiple speed motor drive system.

## Abstract
An oil shear clutch brake unit 16 includes a hous ing 22 rotatably supporting an input shaft 36 and an output shaft 38 in axial alignment, and the housing encloses a set of interfitting clutch plates 48 and discs 46 for coupling the input shaft to the output shaft and a set of interfitting brake plates 56 and discs 58 for braking the output shaft. A non rotating piston 65 is also enclosed within the housing and is fluid actuated in both directions from a spring biased neutral position for either clamping the clutch plates and discs or clamping the brake plates and discs. A cooling and lubricating oil is circulated within the housing and be tween the plates and discs, and the pressure of the fluid for actuating the piston is adjustable for selecting the torque transmitted through the clutch and brake. The output shaft 38 of the clutch brake unit 16 drives the shaft 13 of a high speed electric motor 12 and the input shaft 36 is coupled to the output shaft 32 of a slow speed motor gear reducer unit 14 which mounts directly on the housing 22 of the clutch brake unit.
