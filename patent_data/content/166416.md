# A method for the suspension polymerization of vinyl chloride monomer in an aqueous medium.

## Abstract
The invention provides an improvement in the suspen sion polymerization of vinyl chloride in an aqueous medium in the presence of a monomer soluble polymerization initia tor, according to which the amount of polymer scale deposi tion on the reactor walls can be greatly decreased. The im provement comprises admixing the aqueous polymeri zation medium with a a water soluble crosslinked copoly mer of an unsaturated carboxylic acid monomer, e.g. acryl ic acid and a crosslinking monomer such as di meth allyl ether of diethyleneglycol and b a non ionic surface active agent in combination.
