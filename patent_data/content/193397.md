# Light sensitive silver halide color photographic material.

## Abstract
A light sensitive silver halide color photographic mate rial having photographic constituent layers including a blue sensitive silver halide emulsion layer, a green sensitive silver halide emulsion layer and a red sensitive silver halide emulsion layer on a support wherein the content of silver bromide of the silver halides in the green sensitive silver halide emulsion layer and red sensitive silver halide emul sion layer is 5 to 65 mole , and the green sensitive silver halide emulsion layer contains at least one of the com pounds represented by the formula I shown below According to the light sensitive silver halide color photo graphic material of this invention, rapid development proces sing is possible with improvement of processing stability in the rapid developing processing, and yet saving of silver is possible, simultaneously with inhibition of generation of fog, and moreover color image with good light resistance can be obtained.
