# Method of preparation of a substrate for a liquid crystal display device, a positive display type liquid crystal display device, and a method of constructing such a device.

## Abstract
A liquid crystal display device of the positive dis play type is constructed using substrates 1 , each of which is specially prepared by applying a film of insulat ing material 3 on the surface contacting the liquid crystal material 5, 6 , rubbing the film with a cloth in a predetermined direction, and thereafter treating the film with a silane surfactant 4 . This construction, under conditions of no applied voltage, causes the molecules of the liquid crystal material to orient with their axes perpendicular to the surfaces of the substrate with a small angle of tilt in a fixed direction from the normal to the substrate surface.
