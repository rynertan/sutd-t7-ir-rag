# Open end ratchet like wrench with releasable locking head.

## Abstract
A two way open end wrench has a rotatable, captive, split socket 13 which is selectively locked and unlocked to the wrench handle 5 for torque transmittal through the meshing engagement of two opposed sets of teeth 12, 16 . One set 16 is disposed around the periphery of the open sided socket member 13 and the other 12 within the forward, concave end of a spring loaded coupler 9 dis posed partly within and partly outside the wrench body 2 . Engagement of the teeth 12, 16 is effected by the inward movement of the coupler 9 when a user grips the wrench handle 5 preparatory to turning it. Relaxation of the grip at the end of a stroke permits the handle 5 to be returned to the starting position while the socket 13 remains stationary. A projecting extension 21 on the socket 13 provides for manual rotation to the open position, permitting the took to be withdrawn from a fastener on a tubing line, pipe or cable.
