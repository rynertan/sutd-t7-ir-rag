# System for controlling the transmission ratio of an infinitely variable transmission.

## Abstract
An infinitely variable transmission has a primary pulley 24 having a hydraulically shiftable disc 24a and a hydraulic cylinder 22 for operating the disc, and a secondary pulley 25 having a hydraulically shiftable disc 25a and a hydraulic cylinder 28 for operating that disc. A belt 26 engages with both pulleys. A hydraulic circuit has a transmission ratio con trol valve 44 for controlling shifting of the disc of the primary pulley 24 in either the downshift or upshift direction. The transmission ratio control valve 44 is operated to shift the disc 24a of the primary pulley 24 in the downshift direction, when a throttle valve of an engine is opened rapidly when the vehicle accelerates, by a control unit 56 which receives input from a throttle position sensor 54 and operates a solenoid valve 51 connected to operate control valve 44 .
