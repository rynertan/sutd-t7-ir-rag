# Apparatus for thermally fixing the formed thermoplastic products.

## Abstract
A process and apparatus for pneumatic pressure form ing or vacuum pneumatic pressure forming a web of ther moplastic material into the matrix form of containers and having thus formed plastic product processed with thermal fixation operation, which comprises in combination the steps of holding a forming mold at a thermal fixing temperature for the plastic to be formed so as to have the matrix of containers thermally fixed through a temperature range characteristic of the plastic and cooling off thus formed plastic containers, while maintaining the interior of the formed plastic containers at such a pressure level that the formed plastic containers are no longer subjected to any risk of deformation after the forming mold is removed, and after having been removed from the engagement with the forming mold.
