## Description
COMBUSTIBLE COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS FOR PRODUCING THEM The present invention relates to combustible compositions and includes compositions which in relatively small pieces are useful as firelighters as well as compositions which may be used to make artificial firelogs. The compositions of the invention may also be used as fuel. Known combustible compositions include those compositions which are used as firelighters, charcoal igniters and artificial fire logs. Certain of these compcsitions comprise fuel in the form of a wax, gel or paste, optionally filled with organic, combustible solids such as wood waste, e.g. wood flour or wood shavings . Compositions of that kind are often referred to as brown fire lighters since the presence of the combustible filler generally gives rise to a brown colouration. A very popular type of fire lighter composition is the type generally known as white firelighter . This is generally composed of a liquid oil fuel such as kerosene encapsulated in pores in a block of solid resin, e.g.urea formaldehyde resin. The product is made, by forming an oil in water emulsion in which the aqueous phase contains precursors for the resin, which aqueous phase if then set to form the product. The manufacture of this type of product presently involves the liberation of formaldehyde, a known irritant and use of this material is undesirable. Typically, white firelighter is superior to brown in terms of the length of time the composition burns for a given fuel content. Also the white colour has become associated with firelighters. We have now found that a combustible composition which does not contain a formaldehyde based resin can provide burning characteristics which approach those of white firelighters and can if desired be white in colour. The present invention provides a block of a combustible composition comprising a gelled liquid or liquefiable fuel filled with expanded perlite and preferably substantially free of combustible filler materials. A composition according to the invention may be similar to a conventional brown firelighter composition except that expanded perlite replaces the organic, combustible solid used as filler. The liquid fuel may be gelled by means of a suitable thickener such as metal soap including aluminium stearates and octanoates, carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxymethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, nitrocellulose, gums such as xanthan, arabic, tragacanthe shellacs, rosin, lignosulphates, tall oil cuts, quebracho extracts, caseinates, gelatin, higher alcohols, synthetic polymers such as polybutanols, ethylene copolymers, polyvinyl alcohols, polyvinyl acetate, vinyl cellulose, polyketones, polyesters, phenoxy resins, polymeric diols, vinyl butyral resins, vinyl acetate polyvinyl chloride copolymers, N doco hydroxybutyramide, polyamides and inorganics such as silica xerogel know as fumed silica , thickening clays such as bentonite, laponite, montmorillonite and mixtures thereof. Other inorganic materials may be incorporated as additional fillers. Examples of materials which may be used in conjunction with expanded perlite are chalk, china clay, diatomaceous earth, perlite rock, sand, FILLITE which is a particulate solid separated from boiler ash and has the form of microspheres, vermiculite, talc, and exfoliated vermiculite. Of course, the use of some of these additional fillers may be inconsistent with obtaining a white product. Preferably, the density of any such supplementary inorganic non combustible particulate solids is similar to or less than that of the liquefiable fuel component. More preferably, the density of the solid is much less than that of the liquefiable fuel component. Preferably, the particles of the perlite and any supplementary inorganic solid are impermeable to liquids, that is to say, the fuel cannot completely penetrate the interior of the particles. This may be achieved by coating the perlite with a barrier material which may be a polymeric coating composition such as an alkyd resin or nitrocellulose or a heavy metal soap, a silicone, a silicate, or an oil such as a viscous non drying oil or a drying oil. The amount of expanded perlite that may be included is up to 12 w w of the total composition. Preferably, the amount is less than 8 w w and 1 to 6 w w is especially preferred. It is preferred that the expanded perlite be of relatively small particle size, e.g. about 0.8 mm or less and of relatively low bulk density, e.g. from 40 to 60 kg m3.Johns Manville grade EUP 100 28 is of this preferred type. The composition according to the invention may generally be used as firelighters or charcoal ignites. The compositions may suitably be made into artificial fire logs. The composition of the invention may be prepared in a variety of ways depending upon whether the final product is to be used as an ignition product for fires on the one hand or barbeque starters on the other hand or an artificial firelog. The manufacture of such product types is well understood and the incorporation of the expanded perlite may be effected by mixing at a suitable stage. Preferably the expanded perlite is added shortly before the product becomes set into block form or set enough to be cut into blocks. This leaves the minimum time of contact between liquid fuel and the perlite and hence mimimises absorption of the fuel by the perlite. Generally therefore it is preferred that the gel is formed first from suitable components that is a thickener as disclosed above, preferably fumed silica or a soap and fuel component in liquid form, for example an alcohol or kerosene. The expanded perlite may then be admixed therewith with stirring to achieve uniform distribution. However the expanded perlite may be dispersed in the fuel whilst it is in the liquid form and then the mixture may be gelled as by addition of soap or its formation in situ. It has been observed that the final product is often of stiffer consistency than the initially formed gel. When soap is used for gelling, it is preferably a C12 C18 fatty acid derived soap. Preferably the soap is a saturated one since these give firmer gels. An example of a preferred material is sodium stearate. Heavier metal soaps such as aluminium stearate may additionally or alternatively be used. The fuel does not have to be normally liquid and materials such as slack wax may be gelled with soap. Preferred proportions of fuel and soap are 3 to 25 by weight soap, more preferably 8 to 15 by weight soap, based on the weight of fuel and soap. The freshly formed composition may be allowed to stand until of satisfactory consistency to be cut into blocks subsequently. Alternatively, the mixture may be moulded into individual blocks and wrapped when set to handleable consistency. Another means of presenting the product is in sealed envelopes which closely fit the outer surfaces of the blocks when set. Where such a composition is to be used as an artificial firelog suitably large pieces may be moulded as by extrusion or compaction and optionally wrapped. Combustible compositions of the present invention are preferably match ignitable. The invention will now be illustrated by the following examples in which parts are by weight Example 1 A stock isopropanol gel composition was prepared by adding 5 parts of CABOSIL M 5, a fumed silica, to 95 parts 4sopropanol with stirring. 2 parts of expanded Perlite Grade EUP 100 28 was added with stirring to 100 parts of the gel. 30 g aliquots of the resultant pasty solid were formed into blocks and ignited in a standard laboratory dish of diameter 65 mm and depth 12 mm and the burning time from ignition to self extinguishing end point was observed. A control lacking perlite was run for comparison. The results obtained were as follows Observed burning time min secSamples with 2 Perlite 22 00Sample with no Perlite 15 30 Thus, it may be seen that the burning time for a composition according to the present invention was protracted as compared with the control, signifying an increase in the efficiency of utilisation of isopropanol.Example 2 Expanded Perlite grade EUP 100 28 was added to portions of the stock gel of Example 1 at increasing levels and the burning times were observed for 30 g blocks of the soft, pasty solid resulting, in a standard laboratory dish as in Example 1 with a control lacking the expanded perlite. The results obtained were as follows age wiw Perlite Observed burning time min sec None Control 15 30 0.5 17 45 1 18 30 2 22 00 3 25 50 5 16 10 At 5 Perlite, masking caused by slow liberation of fuel prematurely extinguished the flame leaving an amount of fuel unburnt. There is significant protraction in burning time in most of these samples compared with the control yet the amount of liquefiable fuel present decreases with increase in concentration of the perlite. That is to say an improvement in efficiency of burning the fuel occurs.Example 3 An ethanol gel was prepared as in Example 1 replacing the isopropanol by industrial methylated spirits. Burning tests were conducted on 30 g blocks on mixtures of the gel with various concentrations of the expanded Perlite as used in Example 1 prepared by mixing with stirring to form a pasty non seperating solid. The burning tests paralleled those of Example 1 age wZw Perlite Observed burning time min sec i.

Example 4 A kerosene gel was prepared as in Example 1 replacing the isopropanol with kerosene. Burning tests analogous to those in the previous Examples were conducted on 30 g blocks of mixtures of the gel with various concentrations of the expanded Perlite as used in Example 1. The mixtures were prepared by admixture with stirring using a folding action of the appropriate amounts of gel and expanded Perlite i ii iii iv v vi Mean sample weight g 30 30 30 30 30 30 Observed burning time min 17.67 19.17 18.50 19.17 18.08 19.25 age w w kerosene 95 94.05 93.10 92.15 91.20 90.25 in sample Burning time per g of kerosene in the 0.62 0.68 0.66 0.69 0.66 0.71 sample min Thus, it may be seen that at up to 5t Perlite inclusion protraction of the burning time occurs and simultaneously there is increased efficiency in kerosene utilisation, although the rate of change in this example is clearly different from that in Example 3. A consideration of the ahove examples shows that the compositions of the invention tested exhibit various surprising advantages over the controls. First it has been found that a large reduction in density of the combustible composition may resat from the addition of expanded perlite, whilst the observed burn time duration of burn in minutes per unit size of block of material seems not to be reduced indicating an improvement in the efficiency in the utilization of the liquefiable fuel per unit volume of product. The reduction in density is in itself advantageous since the bigger product may be produced without using extra fuel or the existing size of product may be maintained with a fuel saving. Whilst in many cases the incorporation of expanded perlite improves the efficiency of burning of the fuel, it is at present not clear how this effedt is achieved. It could be due to the structure of the expanded perlite. in the case of the more solid compositions, the perlite may merely provide a more or less rigid structure within burning block preventing the slight shrinkage effect which normally accompanies collapse of the block during burning, with consequent improvement of burning. Solid blocks exemplified above show an efficiency of fuel burning which tends towards the efficiency of so called white firelighter in burning liquefiable fuel. Again it may be due to a heat insulative effect of the perlite causing reduced heat flow to the fuel in the interior of the block resulting in a reduced rate of vaporisation at the burning surface, or some combination of these effects.
