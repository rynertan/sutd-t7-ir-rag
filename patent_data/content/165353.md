# Slip resistant sole.

## Abstract
A slip resistant shoe sole 10 comprising an outsole layer having a bottom surface defining a region of contact between the sole and the ground, the outsole layer bearing a plurality of channels 12, 16, 30, opening onto the bottom surface to define a pattern of elongated gaps across the contact region, the ratio of the area of the gaps to the surface area of the contact region and the configuration of the gaps being arranged to effectively cause liquid between the contact region and the ground to be conducted away while enhancing the slip resistance produced by the contact region engaging the ground.
