# Oscillating circuit.

## Abstract
An oscillating circuit is disclosed which includes first stage 21A and second stage 21B amplifiers, a feedback circuit formed of a capacitor Ca and a resistor Ra and connected between the output terminal of the second stage amplifier and the input terminal of the first stage amplifier and a crystal reso nator X having a predetermined resonance frequency con nected to the first stage amplifier. In this case, the total gain of the oscillating circuit is determined in such a manner that the oscillating circuit initiates its oscillation only when the crystal resonator is connected to the first stage amplifier.
