# Preparation of fructose.

## Abstract
The invention concerns a process for the preparation of fructose by hydrolysis of fructose polymers inulin or levan from vegetable origin. According to the invention, comminuted vegetable mat ter containing a fructose polymer is brought in contact in an aqueous medium with an enzyme that hydrolyses fructose polymers, and fructose is isolated from the solution thus obtained. Specifically, inulin containing matter is treated with the enzyme inulase. An advantage of the process is, that the formation of byproducts can be avoided, resulting in easy recovery of the fructose in crystalline form.
