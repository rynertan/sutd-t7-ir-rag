# Electrical connector assembly.

## Abstract
Herein disclosed is a heat resisting electrical connector assembly which has a heat resisting metallic locking clip. The locking clip is detachably fixed to a female part of the connector assembly and comprises a first portion lockably fixed to the female part, a second portion having a locking opening formed therein and a third portion having a free end, the third portion being resiliently moved together with the free end thereof toward the first portion when pressed to ward the first portion. A male part of the connector assembly is formed with a projection with which the locking opening of the clip is engaged upon final coupling of the male and female parts. A fulcrum structure is formed on the female part to support partially the third portion of the clip in such a manner that when the third portion is pressed toward the first portion, the second portion is raised away from the first por tion thereby disengaging the locking opening of the clip from the projection.
