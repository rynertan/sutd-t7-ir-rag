# Reel speed valve assembly.

## Abstract
A reel speed valve assembly for controlling the speed of a combine reel including a double acting compensator valve 600 , a proportional control valve 700 , and a relief valve 900 , a load sense valve, the reel speed valve may be operated as either a closed or open center valve and may be located at any position in a stack with minimal adjustment to manufacturing procedures. A feedback loop from an assem bly outlet port 300 to an assembly inlet port 500 maintains a substantially constant pressure drop across the valve assembly.
