## Description
N Acyl Amino Acid Derivatives The invention relates to novel pharnaceutically useful N acyl amino acid derivatives which are inhibitors of anyiotensin converting enzyme. The invention provides said compounds per se, pharmaceuti cal compositions comprising said compounds, methods of medical treatment using said compounds, processes for preparing said compounds and novel intermediates formed in said processes. BACKGROUtXD OF THE INVENTION Angiotensin II is an active pressor octapeptide which is implicated as s causative agent in various forms of mammalian hypertension. It is formed by the action of the protease angiotensin converting enzyme ACE on the decapeptide Angiotensin I which is produced by the action of renin on the pseudoglobulinAngiotensinogen. ACE is not specific in its cleavage of Angiotensin I but acts on a nunber of peptides, including the vasodepressor nonapeptide bradykinin, to cleave a dipeptide residue from theC terminal end of the peptide. It has been proposed to treat angiotensin dependent hypertension in mammals, especially man, by administering an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme. In particular, U.S. Patent No. 4046889 toOndetti and Cushman issued September 6th 1977, discloses the use of certain proline derivatives and related compounds as ACE inhibitors.These proline derivatives and related compounds have the following general formula EMI2.1 wherein R represents hydroxy, NH2 or alkoxy of 1 to 7 carbon atoms R1 and R4 each represent hydrogen, alkyl of 1 to 7 carbon atoms or phenylalkyl in which the alkyl moiety has 1 to 7 carbon atoms R2 represents hydrogen or R5CO R3 represents hydrogen, hydroxy or alkyl of 1 to 7 carbon atoms R5 represents alkyl of 1 to 7 carbon atoms, phenyl or phenylalkyl in which the alkyl moiety has 1 to 7 carbon atoms m represents 1 to 3 and n represents 0 to 2.The reportedly most preferred of said compounds ofU.S. Patent No. 4046889 is the compound Captopril or SO 14225 which is the compound of the above general formula wherein R represents hydroxy R1 represents methyl R2, R3 and R4 each represent hydrogen and rn and n each represent 1. Other ACE inhibitors have also been reported including venom peptides see, for example, Cushman et al, Experientia 1973, 29, 1032 and certain carboxyalkanoyl analogues of the mercaptoalkanoylprolines ofU.S. Patent No. 4046889 see, for example, Cushman et al, Biochemistry 1977, 16, 5484, and Ondetti et al,Science 1977, 196, 441 carboxy alkylacylamino acids Cushman et al, U.S. Patents No. 4,052,511 issued October 4, 1977, and 4,128,653 issuedDecember 5, 1978 thio acylamino acids Ondetti et al, U.S. Patent 4,116,962 issuea September 26, 1978 halogen substituted mercaptoacylamino acids Ondetti et al, U.S. Patent No. 4,154,935 issued May 15, 1979 mercaptoacyl heterocyclic carboxylic acids Bernstein et al, U.S. Patent No.4,154,934 issued May 15, 1979 1 1,2 dithiolane 4 yl carbonyl I,proline Ondetti et al, U.S.Patent No. 4,154,936 issued May 15, 1979 and hydroxycarbamoylalkylacyl pipecolic acid Cushman et al, U.S. Patent No. 4,154,937 issued May 15, 1979 . The previously proposed ACE inhibitors are competitive inhibitors in that they compete with the natural substrates for binding3 to an active site of ACE. Whilst the inhibitors can be bound more tightly to said active site than the natural substrates, there is no covalent bond formation between the inhibitor and the enzyme and hence the inhibition is reversible. In recent years the concept of enzyme activated irreversible inhibitors otherwise known as suicide or that inhibitors has been developed see, for example, Enzyme Activated Irreversible Inhibitors ,Ed. Seiler et al, Elsevier North Holland BiomedicalPress, 1978, ISBN 0 444 80080 8 . This concept is that an enzyme can be irreversibly inhibited by a substrate which contains a latent reactive group which is activated by the enzyme to form a reactive specie which eventually reacts with the enzyme or the cofactor to form a covalent bond therewith and thereby irreversibly inactivates the enzyme. It is an object of the present invention to provide an enzyme activated irreversible inhibitor for angiotensin converting enzyme. It is another object of the invention to provide. an efficacious angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. A further objection of the invention is to provide an efficacious method of treating hypertension. Additional objects will be apparent from the following description of the invention. SUGARY OF THE INVENTION According to a first aspect of the present invention, there are provided novel N acyl amino acid derivatives of the following general Formula 1 EMI5.1 Formula 1 wherein Z represents an electron withdrawing group, preferably cyano or a carbonyl terminated functional group X represents a group which, in combination with , can form a Michael acceptor after abstraction of the proton from the carbon atom adjacent to X, and preferably X is ethynyl or a fluoromethyl group R1 represents hydrogen, alkyl of 1 to 7 carbon atoms, or phenylalkyl in which the alkyl moiety has 1 to 7 carbon atoms and 22 represents an aminocarboxylic acid residue obtained by removal of a hydrogen atom from the amino group thereof, and preferably an amino acid residue and derivatives thereof, especially non toxic hydrolysable derivatives, such as for example pharmaceutically acceptable salts, amides and esters, which derivatives are transformed in vivo into compounds of Formula 1. The invention includes individual optical isomers as well as racemates and other optical isomer mixtures of said compounds of Formula 1 and of the said prodrugs thereof. Compounds of Formula 1 are pharmacologically useful in that they inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme and can be used to treat angiotensin dependent hypertension in man and other mammals.

It is particularly preferred that R10 represents C1 C4 alkyl, phenyl or benzyl and that R10 represents C1 C4 alkyl, especially s butyl, or benzyl. References in this Specification, including theClaims, to an alkyl group or moiety mean a straight or branched chain alkyl group or moiety of 1 to 7 carbon atoms unless some further linitation is stated or clearly implied by the context. Further, reference to a specific alkyl group or moiety having structural isomers includes all of those isomers and mixtures thereof unless a particular isomer is specified or clearly implied by the context. Thus, the alkyl groups or moieties generally referred to in connection with the definition and exemplification of the electron withdrawing group Z and elsewhere in the Specification are methyl ethyl n propyl isopropyl butyl, for example n butyl, sec butyl, and tert butyl pentyl, for example n pentyl, neo pentyl and tert pentyl hexyl, for example isohexyl and heptyl, for example 5 methylhexyl.Unless, otherwise stated, the alkyl groups and moieties preferably have 1 to 4 carbon atoms, i.e. methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl. Illustrative examples of preferred phenylalkyl groups are benzyl, phenethyl, l phenylethyl, 3phenylpropyl, and 4 phenylbutyl.

Illustrative examples of preferred alkoxycarbonyl groups are methoxycarbonyl otherwise carbomethoxy , ethoxycarbonyl otherwise carboethoxy , n propoxycarbonyl, n butoxycarbonyl, tertbutoxycarbonyl and sec butoxycarbonyl. Illustrative examples of preferred phenylalkoxycarbonyl groups are benzyloxycarbonyi,2 phenylethoxy carbonyl, l phenylethoxycarbonyl, 3 phenylpropoxy carbonyl, and 4 phenylbutoxycarbonyl.

When, as in connection with the exemplification above of the electron withdraing group Z, the same symbol, for example Rlo, is used more than once in the same formula, said symbols can represent identical or different groups within the definition of the relevant symbol. Unless stated or clearly implied by the context, the term halogen used in this Specification, including the Claims1 means bromine, chlorine, fluorine and iodine and the preferred halogens are chlorine and fluorine. Illustrative examples of halogenoacetyl groups are chloroacetyl and fluoroacetyl. The symbol X in Formula 1 represents a group which, in combination with the electron withdrawing group Z can form a Michael acceptor after abstraction of the proton from the carbon atom adjacent to the groupX. Michael acceptors have a double bond conjugated with an electron withdrawing group and are good substrates for nucleophilic addition at the double bond. The formation of Michael acceptors and conjugate addition of nucleophiles to Michael acceptors are so well known per se as not to require detailed discussion at this time.Without restriction to any particular theory as to the mechanism by which the compounds of Formula 1 inhibit ACE, it is believed that ACE catalyses removal of the proton from the carbon atom adjacent to the group X whereby theMichael acceptor is formed and subsequently reacts with a nucleophilic site of the enzyme to form a covalent bond therewith by conjugate addition. This proposed mechanism can be represented as follows EMI14.1 Inactivated Enzyme In the above scheme Z, X, R1 and R2 are as defined in connection with Formula 1, X is the residue of X upon formation of the Michael acceptor, and ACE is angiotensin converting enzyme. The preferred groups X are ethynyl i.e. CrCH and fluoromethyl of the formula CFpH3 p wherein p represents 1, 2 or 3 i.e. mono , di and tri fluoromethyl . The symbol R in Formula 1 represents hydrogen, alkyl of 1 to 7 carbon atoms or phenylalkyl in which the alkyl moiety has 1 to 7 carbon atoms. It is preferred that R1 represents hydrogen or alkyl.When R1 represents alkyl or phenylalkyl, it is intended that reference should be made to the definition of alkyl and the exemplification of alkyl and phenylalkyl provided hereinbefore. It is preferred that the alkyl group has 1 to 4 carbon atoms and that the alkyl moiety of the phenylalkyl group also has 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Methyl is the most preferred alkyl group and benzyl is the most preferred phenylalkyl group. The symbol R2 in Formula 1 represents an aminocarboxylic acid residue obtained by removal of a hydrogen from the amino group thereof. Preferably, the amino acid residue has the amino group attached to an carbon atom relative to the carboxylic acid group and suitably, but not necessarily, is the residue of a naturally occurring mammalian amino acid. The carboxylic acid group of the residue can be.a free carboxyl or a non toxic hydrolysable derivative thereof which is transformed in vivo into the carboxyl group. In particular, the carboxylic acid group can be present in Formula 1 in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salty amide, such as primary amide or ester, such as alkyl ester. In one preferred embodiment, the group R2 has the formula EMI16.1 wherein R3 and RA represent hydrogen or the side chain of a naturally occurring mammalian amino acid of the formulaEMI16.2 and R5 represents hydroxy, alkoxy of 1 to 7 carbon atoms, primary amino i.e. NH2 orEMI16.3 in which R3, R4 and R5 are as defined above. In another preferred embodiment, the group R2 has the formula EMI16.4 wherein R3, represents hydrogen and R4 represents hydrogen or alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms and optionally substituted by indole, by imidazole or by phenyl, or R3 and R4 together represent alkylene or alkenylene, said alkylene and alkenylene having 2, 3 or 4 chain carbon atoms and being optionally substituted by hydroxy, by alkyl of 1 to 7 carbon atoms or, in the hydrocarbon chain, by a sulfur atom and R51 represents hydroxy, alkoxy of 1 to 7 carbon atoms, primary amino, orEMI17.1 in whichR3 , R4 and R5, are as defined above.

It is particularly preferred that the group R2 has the formula EMI19.1 wherein m represents 1, 2 or 3, R5 represents hydroxy, alkoxy of 1 to 7 carbon atoms1 or amino, and R6 represents hydrogen, hydroxy, alkyl of 1 to 7 carbon atoms or R6 on each of two adjacent carbon atoms together represent a second valency bond joining those carbon atoms. When m is 2 or 3, each R6 radical is independently selected from those defined above and can be the same as or different from another R6 radical in the molecule. The especially preferred groups R2 are the proline residues in which m represents 2 and the most preferred group R2 is 2 carboxy l pyrrolidinyl where m represents 2, R5 represents hydroxy and R6 represents hydrogen. When R5, R5 or R5 represent alkoxy and or R6 represents alkyl, it is intended that reference should be made to the definition of alkyl and the exemplifi cation of alkyl and alkoxy provided hereinbefore. It is preferred that when R6 represents alkyl, the alkyl group has 1 to 4 carbon atoms and that when R5, R5 or Rg represents alkoxy, the alkoxy group has 1 to 4 carbon atoms. The compounds of Formula 1 exist as at least two enantiomers because the a carbon atom relative to the electron withdrawing group Z is asymmetrical, If R1 represents alkyl or phenylalkyl, a further asymmetrical centre is present in the molecule. Moreover, another asymmetrical centre can be provided by the aminoacid residue. As mentioned previously, the present invention include not only racemates and other mixtures of the optical isomers but also the individual optical isomers. Methods of selecting reactants and or optically resolving intermediates to provide a desired individual optical isomer are well known per se to those skilled in the art. See, for example, Stereochemistry of Chemical Compounds , Eliel, McGraw Hill, N.Y. 1962, pp. 49 63. The invention also includes derivatives which are transformed in vivo into the compounds of Formula 1. Said derivatives include especially non toxic hydrolysable derivatives such as salts, amides and esters. Examples of amides and esters are those compounds referred to above in which R5 represents amino or alkoxy.The salts can be acid addition salts of basic centres in the molecule or base salts of acid centres in the molecule. Illustrative of acid addition salts are those with inorganic acids, such as hydrochloric, hydroromic, sulfuric and phosphoric acids, and with organic acids, such as salicylic, malec, malonic,, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, cyclamic or methane sulfonic acids. Illustrative of basic salts are those with inorganic bases, such as ammonium, alkali metals, for example sodium, potassium and lithium alkaline earth metals, for example calcium and magnesium, and light metals of Group IIIA, for example aluminium with organic bases such as cyclohexylamine, ethylamine, ethylaminoethanol, ethanolamine, piperazine, benzathine, N methyl Dglucamine, and with amino acids such as arginine and lysine. In addition to pharmaceutically acceptable salts1 other salts such as those acid addition salts with picric or oxalic acid and those basic salts with dicyclohexamine are useful as intermediates in the purification of compounds of Formula 1, in the preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts, or for the characterisation and identification of compounds of Formula 1. The salts, amides and esters can be prepared from corresponding compounds of Formula 1 by conventional methods well known in the art.

The compounds of Formula 1 in which X represents a fluoromethyl group see following generalFormula 13 can be prepared by decarboxylation of the corresponding , carboxy propionamide derivative of the following general Formula 14.EMI41.1 In Formulae 13 and 14, Z and R1 are as defined in connection with Formula 1, p represents 1, 2 or 3, and R2 is as defined for R2 in connection withFormula 1 but the carboxyl group of the amino acid residue R2 can be in the form of, for example, an ester or amide, in which case the carboxyl group can be freed in manner known per se after the decarboxylation. Conveniently, the decarboxylation can be carried ou.t in manner known per se at a temperature in the range 00 to 200 C, preferably about i100C in the presence of an acid such as trifluoroacetic acid, acetic acid, hydro chloric acid or sulfuric acid for a period in the range of 1 to 48 hours. The A carboxy propionamide derivatives ofFormula 14 can be prepared by acid catalysed hydrolysis or hydrogenolysis of the corresponding ester propionamide derivative of the following generalFormula 15.EMI42.1 Formula 15 Formula 14In Formula 15, p, 2, R1 and R2, are as defined in connection with Formula 14 and C02R7 represents a hydrolysable ester group. Suitably R7 represents alkyl of 1 to 7 carbon atoms, phenylalkyl in which the alkyl moiety has 1 to 7 carbon atoms, phenyl, p methoxy phenyl, dibenzyl, trityl or 2,2,2 trichloroethyl.Preferably, R7 is alkyl, especially tert butyl, benzyl, dibenzyl or trityl. Conveniently, the acid hydrolysis can be carried out by treatment in manner known per se with acid at room temperature for about 1 hour.Said hydrolysis can be effected as a preliminary stage in the decarboxylation supra without separation of the B carboxy propionamide of Formula 14. If the ester of Formula 15 is subjected to hydrogenolysis, conventional conditions can be used, for example, in an ethanol solution in the presence of a platinum or palladium catalyst, such as PtO2 or Pd C, under a hydrogen atmosphere at about 250C for 1 to 48 hours. If Z in Formula 15 is an ester group, the hydrolysable ester group CO 2R7 can be selected so that only the desired ester group CO2R7 is converted into a carboxyl group thereby providing the required hemiester. It is preferred in such circumstances that R7 is tert butyl, dibenzyl or trityl because these groups are hydrolysed under relatively mild conditions which will not hydrolyse a number of other esters such as benzyl, straight chain alkyl or phenyl esters. In the case of hydrogenolysis, it is preferred that R7 is benzyl because hydrogenolysis to remove benzyl will not remove an alkyl ester constituting the group Z. However, reaction conditions can be employed which will convert an ester groupZ in Formula 15 to a free acid group Z in Formula 14 or 13. When Z in Formula 15 is a cyano group or an ester group, the ester propionamide derivatives ofFormula 15 can be prepared by acylation of the corresponding aminoacid, in which any free carboxyl group is protected,by the corresponding butanedioic hemiester derivative of the following general Formula 16.EMI44.1 Formula 16 Formula 15A In Formulae 15A and 16, p, R1, R2 and R7 are as defined in connection with Formula 15 and Z represents a cyano or ester group i.e. CO2R10 and CO.SRlo where Rlo is as defined in connection with Formula 4 except that it does not rePresent hydrogen.The acylation can be performed in manner known per se for example in the presence of a dehydrating agent such as dicyclohexyldiimide and in an inert solvent such as ethyl acetate, methylene chloride or acetonitrile at a temperature in the range 70 to 1000C for a period of 0.5 to 8 days.

Suitably R8 represents alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, benzyl, phenyl or tri methylsilylethyl. The hydrolysis is conducted under basic or neutral conditions in manner known per se.For example, 1 to 1.5 equivalents of a base, such as sodium hydroxide or tetraallryla oniux hydroxide, is employed in an aqueous solvent, such as aqueous alcohol or aqueous tetrahydrofuran at a temperature in the range 0 to 1000C for a period of 1 to 24 hours. In an alternative hydrolysis, an alkali thiolate such as lithium thiolate in an aprotic solvent such as dimethylsulfoxide or hexamethyl phosphoric acid triamide can be used in manner known per se. In a further alternative, tri methylsilyl iodide optionally in an aprotic solvent such as carbontetrachloride can be used in manner known per Se. It is convenient to resolve optical isomerism in the production of compounds for Formula 1 at the intermediates of Formula 16. In particular, the extracted butanedioic hemiesterproduct obtained as above can be optically resolved using conventional techniques well known to those skilled in the art. The butanedioic ester derivatives of Formula 17 can be prepared by fluoromethylation of the corresponding butanedioic ester derivatives of the followingFormula 18.EMI46.1 Formula 18 Formula 17In Formula 18, Z , R1, R7 and R8 are as defined in connection with Formula 17.

The reaction can be performed by stirring at a temperature in the range 70 to 800C for a period of 1 to 48 hours and the fluoromethylated product of Formula 17 can be extracted from the reacted nixture by an organic solvent, such as diethylether or methylene chloride.The carbanion can be obtained in manner known per se by reacting the compound of Formula 18 in the aprotic solvent with a base, such as sodium hydride, potassium hydride, lithium acetylide, lithium carbide, sodamide, potassium tert butoxide, and lithium diisopropylamide at a temperature in the range 0 to 700C for a period of 1 to 24 hours. The aprotic solvent can be, for example, diethylether, tetrahydrofuran, hexamethylphosphoric acid triamide, dimethylsulfoxide, dioxane, benzene and mixtures thereof. The esters of Formula 18 can be prepared by alliylation with an ester derivative of the following general Formula 19 of a malonate of the following general Formula 20.EMI47.1 Formula 20 Formula 19 Formula 18In Formulae 19 and 20, Z , R1, 7 and R8 are as defined in connection with Formula 18 and Y is a leaving group, preferably chlorine, bromine, tosyloxy, or methylsulfonyloxy.

Suitable bases include sodium hydride, sodium ethoxide or potassium tertbutoxide. Suitable solvents include the aprotic solvents hexamethylphosphorus triamide or tetrahydrofuran and the protic solvents ethanol and tert butanol.As well known in the art, the actual base employed is dependent upon the nature of the solvent. Usually the malonate reactant, ester reactant and base will be used in the molar ratio of 1 1 to 1.1 1 to 1.5. An optical isomer of the ester reactant can be selected to provide the required optical isomer of the product of Formula 18. Many malonates of Formula 20 are known and some are available commercially. In general, those malon ates in which Z represents cyano can be obtained by esterification of cyanoacetic acid whilst those malonates in which Z represents an ester group can be obtained by esterification of malonic or mercaptocarbonylacetic acid or a hemiester thereof. The malonates of Formula 2t in which R7 represents tertbutyl, dibenzyl or trityl, Z represents CO2R7 and R7 represents benzyl are novel compounds which are particularly useful in preparing compounds ofFormula 1.

In accordance with known procedures, the ester functions and reaction conditions are chosen so that only the desired ester group is converted into the free carboxyl group. Thus, in the case of acid hydrolysis it is preferred that R7 and any protecting ester group in the aminoacid residue R2, are straight chain alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms and that R10 is tert. butyl,dibenzyl or trityl. In the case of hydrogenolysis, it is preferred that R7 and any protecting ester group in the aminoacid residue R2, is straight or branched chain alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms and that R10 is benzyl.

The resultant intermediate compound of the following general Formula 25 is then subjected to acid hydrolysis in manner known per se at a temperature in the range 0 to 1000C for 1 to 24 hours and then heated to cause rearrangement to the desired compound of Formula 15.EMI59.2 Formula 25Compounds of Formula 15 in which Z representsEMI59.3 where R10 is as defined in connection withFormula 15A and R11 is as defined in connection withFormula 1 can be prepared in manner known per se by diazotizing the corresponding glycyl compound using, for example, sodium nitrite in the presence of an acid.When the acid is hydrochloric, hydrobromic or sulfuric acid, the product is the corresponding monochloroalkyl , monobromoalkyl , or hydroxyalkyl ketone respectively.These derivatives can be reacted in the manner described above with reference to Formula 24 and its deriva tvpq. to Drovide other derivatives of Formula W5 in which Z representsEMI60.1 Compounds of Formula 1 in which Z represents an electron withdrawing group other than cyano or ester, can also be prepared from corresponding compounds of Formula 1 in which Z represents C02Rlo often via the corresponding acid chloride or anhydride.In particular, they can be obtained via an acid chloride of the following general Formula23Ausing the methods described above in connection with the preparation of the corresponding compounds of Formula 15. EMI60.2 Formula 23A.In Formula 234 p, R1 and R21 are as defined in connection with Formula 15. In general terms however, it is preferred to use the routes via the acid chloride of Formula 23 because of the risk of dchyliroEluorination when proceeding via the acid chloride ofFormula 23A. In particular, tic action in manner known per se of a strong base on the compounds ofFormula 15 can provide the corresponding fluoromethylene derivative of the following general Formula 26.EMI60.3 Formula 26. Use of said dehydro luoriflJ tion can be made to convert tri fluoromethyl and difluoromethyl derivatives ofFormula 1 into the corresponding difluoromethyl and monofluoromethyl derivatives respectively by subsequently ctalytically hydrogenating in manner known per Se the fluoromethylene derivitives.The dehydro fluorinction can be carried out in a protic or aprotic solvent, such as water, methanol, ethanol, tetrahydro furan, diethylether, dioxane, dimethylsulfoxide, ethyl acetate, hexamethylphosphoric triamide, benzene, carbon tetrachloride or a mixture thereof, using an equimolar amount or, when Z represents CO2H, two equivalents of a base, such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, sodamide, sodium acctylidc, lithium carbide, triethylamine or pyridine, at a temperature in the range of 200C to solvent boiling point for a period of 0.1 to 24 hours.The catalytic hydrogenation can be carried out under a hydrogen atmosphere of 1 to 150 atmospheres at a temperature in the range 250 to 1500C for a period of 1 to 48 hours using, for example PtO2, Pd C or RhCl P C0H5 3 3 as catalyst. The actual sequence of the stages in the reaction schemes discussed above can be varied as will be apparent to those skilled in chemical synthesis. In particular, when Z in the butanedioic ester ofFormula 17 represents a carboxylic ester group i.e. CO2R10 where R10 is as defined in connection with Formula 15h , said group can be converted into the group Z of the required compound of Formula 1 or into a precursor of said group Z before formation of the amide function i.e. C02R2 or C02R2, at the other end of the molecule. The appropriate selection of the ester groups C02R7, C and CO2R10 and of the hydrolysis conditions employed will allow intermediates in the reaction scheme, such as compounds ofFormula 17, to be selectively hydrolysed enabling the required reaction sequence to be followed. In a particularly preferred alternative sequence to those previously discussed, the pentanetrioic triester of Formula 17 is selectively hydrolysed to the ester acid of the Formula 27.EMI62.1 Formula 17A Formula 27 wherein , R1, R7 and R10 e as defined in connection with Formula 15 and R8 is as defined in connection with Formula 17. Preferably R10 is tert butyl and R7 and R8 are straight chain alkyl of 1 to 4 carbons, or benzyl, in which case the hydrolysis can readily be carried out using acid conditions, especially trifluoroacetic acid. The esteracid of Formula 27 can be converted into the acid chloride of Formula 28 by, for example, treatment with thionylchloride and said acid chloride converted into the desired electron withdrawing group Z.EMI63.1 Formula 28. Particularly preferred intermediates obtainable from the acid chlorides of Formula 28 are the 5 amino3 fluorinated methyl 4 oxo pentanoic acids of tb e following general Formula 29 and functional derivatives thereof.EMI63.2 Formula 29 wherein R1 and R10 are as defined in connection withFormula 4 and E represents 1, 2 or 3. The compounds of Formula 29 in which R10 represents hydrogen can be obtained by converting the acid chloride of Formula 28 into the corresponding bromomethyl ketone, converting said bromomethyl ketone into the corresponding phthalimide and hydrolysing the phthalimide. When R10 does not represent hydrogen, the compounds of Formula 29 can be obtained by reacting the acid chloride of Formula 28 with a Schiffs base or isonitrile,subsequent hydrolysis and heating. The individual reaction stages have been discussed above in connection with the preparation of compounds of Formula 15 and the reaction sequences are shown below.EMI64.1 The compounds of Formula 29 are irreversible inhibitors of delta aminolevulinic acid dehydrase and as such of use in medicine in, for example, the treatment of porphyria.

In Formulae 30 and 31, p, R1 and R2 are as defined in connection with Formula 13 and Z represents the electron withdrawing group Z or a protected form of said group Z.

The cyanodithianyl trifluoro compounds of Formula 30 can be prepared in manner known per se.by an analogous synthesis to that of the phenylthianyl compounds of Formula 30 described above but using an anion derived from 2 cyanodithiane by treatment with lithium diisopropylamide. The cyanodithiane reactant can be prepared in manner known per se by dehydrating 2carbamoyldithiane, for example, by treatment with phosphorous oxychloride, optionally in a solvent such as dichloroethylene, at a temperature in the range 50 to 1000C for a period of 1 to 12 hours. 2carbamoyldithiane can be prepared in manner known per se from 2 methoxycarbonyldithiane by treatment with aqueous or alcoholic ammonia or from 2 carboxydithiane by treatment with thionylchloride to form the acid chloride which is then treated with aqueous ammonia. The tris phenylthio methyl trifluoro compounds ofFormula 30 can be prepared in manner known per se by an analogous synthesis to that of the phenyldithianyl compounds of Formula 30 described above but using the carbanion derived from triphenylthioorthoformate. In the particular case where Z in Formula 13 represents formyl, it is preferred that when p is 3 Z inFormulae 30 and 31 represents bis phenylthio methyl which can be converted into the required formyl group by any of the methods described above for conversion of phenyldithianyl to benzoyl. The ornyl group can be converted to the acid by methods known per se. The bis phenylthio methyl trifluoro compounds ofFormula 30 can be prepared in manner known per se by, for example, treating the corresponding tris phenylthio methyl compounds of Formula 30 with a 2 to 6 fold excess of chromium II chloride in dimethylformamidewater 4 1 at about 1000C for a period of 1 to 3 hours. Alternatively, said tris phenylthio methyl compound can be treated with lithium propyl or butyl mercaptide in hexamethylphosphoric acid triamine at a temperature in the range 0 to 250C for a period of 1 to 60 minutes to yield the desired bis phenylthio methyl compound. In the particular case where Z in Formula 13 repre sents methylcarbonyl, it is preferred that when 2 is 3,Z in Formulae 30 and 31 represents methoxyvinyl or A ethoxyvinyl which can be converted in manner known per se into the required methylcarbonyl group. For example, the alkoxyvinyl compound of Formula 31 can be treated with trifluoroacetic acid at a temperature in the range 0 to 250C for a period of 1 to 20 hours followed by treatment with water at about 250C for 10 to 60 minutes. Alternatively, the alkoxyvinyl compound of Formula 31 can be treated with aqueous, especially 1N, hydrochloric acid in methane, preferably in about equal parts by volume, at about 25 C for a period of 12 to 24 hours.In both reactions, the protecting group of the aminoacid carboxyl can be removed. The alkoxy trifluoro compounds of Formula 30 can be prepared in manner known per se by treating the corresponding ethyl trifluorocrotonate with the cuprate reagent derived from d alkoxyvinyl lithium at a temperature in the range 70 to 0 C for a period of 1 to 60 minutes and subsequently hydrolysis of the resultant trifluoromethyl 4 alkoxy pent 4 enoic acid, ethylester with, for example, ethanolic hydroxide.The cuprate reagent can be prepared by the method described by Boechman et al j. Chem. Soc. London Chem. Comm. 1975, 519 . Compounds of Formula 13 in which Z represents a carbonyl terminated functional group, for example COR10, COR2, EMI72.1 CONHORlo andEMI72.2 where R2, is as defined in connection with Formula 13 and R10 and R11 are as defined in connection Formula 4, can be obtained from compounds of Formula 31 in which Z represents 2 cyanodithian2 yl or tris phenylthio methyl by conversion of said group Z into carboxyl and subsequent reaction of the resultant acid in manner known per se. In particular, synthesis from compounds of Formula 13 in which Z represents carboxyl can be conducted in the manner described above in connection with the preparation of compounds of Formula 15. The compounds of Formula 1 in which X represents an ethynyl group see following general Formula 32 can be prepared by acylating in manner known per se the corresponding protected amino acid of the formula HR2 where R29 is as defined in connection with Formula 13 with the corresponding pent 4ynoic acid of the following general Formula 33 to provide an N acyl amino acid derivative of the following general Formula 34 which subsequently can be converted into a compound of Formula 32. EMI74.1 Formula 32 In Formulae 32, 33 and 34, R1 and R2 are as defined in connection with Formula 1, R2 is as defined in connection with Formula 15 and Z represents the electron withdrawing group Z if said group Z is inert under the reaction conditions employed or a protected form of said group Z. If Z represents a protected form of the group Z, it subsequently will be converted in manner known per se into the group Z and said conversion can be carried out before or after the carboxyl group of the amino acid is freed. When Z in Formula 32 represents cyano, it is unnecessary to use a protected form of the cyano group in the reactant of Formula 33 i.e. Z can represent cyano . However, it usually will be necessary to use a protected form of carbonyl terminated functional groups represented by Z in Formula 32. The acylation can be carried out in the manner described above in connection with the acylation of the compounds of Formulae 16 and 30. In general terms, the preferred groups Z will correspond to the required carbonyl terminated group 2 in the same manner as described above in connection with conversion of compounds of Formula 30 into compounds of Formula 13. Thus, Z can represent a 2 phenyldithian 2 yl or 2 p methoxyphenyl dithian 2 yl as protected forms of benzoyl and p methoxy benzyl b 2 tert butoxycarbonyl dithian2 yl as a protected form of carboxycarbonyl c 2 cyanodithian 2 yl or tris phenylthio methyl as protected forms of carboxyl d bis phenylthio methyl as a protected form of formyl and e l methoxyvinyl or ethoxyvinyl as protected forms of methlcarbonyl. Said exemplified groups Z can be converted into their corresponding groups Z in the manner described above in connection with the preparation of compounds of Formula 13. Further, compounds of Formula 32 in which Z represent a carbonylterminated functional group, for example COR10, EMI75.1 where R2 is as defined in connection with Formula 13 and Rlo and R11 are as defined in connection withFormula 4, can be prepared from compounds of Formula 34 in which Z represents carboxyl by analogous methods to those described above in connection with analogous conversions of compounds of Formula 13. The cyano compound of Formula 33 i.e. Z cyano can be prepared in manner known per se by treating an alkyl 1 to 4 carbon atoms ester of a 5 trimethylsilyl pent 4 ynoic acid with a mixture of acetic acid and potassium or sodium cyanide in methanol or ethanol at a temperature in the range 0 to 250C for a period of 1 to 48 hours and then hydrolysing the ester group by treatment with, for example, aqueous alcoholic lithium, sodium or potassium hydroxide at a temperature in the range 0 to 250C for a period of 70 to 180 minutes. The alkylesters of 5 trimethylsilyl pent 4 ynoic acid can be prepared by conventional esterification of the corresponding free acid using, for example, diazomethane to obtain the methyl ester or alkanol and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide to obtain the higher esters. 5 Trimethylsilyl pent 4 ynoic acids can be prepared in manner known per se by oxidation of the corresponding 5 trimethylsilyl pent 2 ene Synyl alcohol using, for example, Jones reagent i.e. chromic anhydride in dilute sulfuric acid at about 250C for a period of 1 to 24 hours. Said alcohol can be prepared by trirnethylslaticn in manner known per se of the corresponding pent 2 ene 4 ynyl alcohol by, for example, treatment with an alkyl magnesium bromide, such as ethylmagnesium bromide, or an alkyl lithium, such as n butyl lithium, in tetrahydrofuran solution at a temperature in the range 700 to OOC for a period of 1 to 2 hours followed by addition of trimethylsilyl chloride.The resultant trimethylsiloxy derivative is then hydrolysed using, for example, aqueous hydrochloric acid at about 250C for a period of 1 to 60 minutes. The dithianyl, phenylthiomethyl and alkoxyvinyl compounds of Formula 33 can be prepared by analogous methods to those described above in connection with the preparation of analogous compounds of Formula 30 but using the corresponding alkyl 5 trimethylsilyl pent 2 ene 4 ynate instead of the alkyl fluoro.crotonate. The compounds of Formula 1 inhibit angiotensinconverting enzyme and are useful in treating conditions in which said enzyme is implicated, especially hypertension in mammals. It is believed that the mechanism involved in the cardiovascular effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors include the following a decreased peripheral resistance due both to inhibition of angiotensin II vasoconstriction and preservation of the vasodilator kinins such as bradykinin b decreased plasma volume due to inhibition of aldosterone secretion, inhibition of release of the antidiuretic hormome and inhibition of the direct effects of angiotensin II on renal sodium readsorp tion and c potential direct vasodilator properties.The compounds of Formula 1 therefore are of use in the treatment of hypertension of all aetiologies, low output heart failure, shock and acute renal failure. Said compounds are believed to inhibit also enkephalinases and hence to be of use as analgesics in that they inhibit the conversion of the endogenous analagesic enkephaline. Further, the compounds of Formula 1 in which R1 represents hydrogen are believed to inhibit delta aminolevulinic acid dehydrase.
