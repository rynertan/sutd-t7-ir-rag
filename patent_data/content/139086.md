# Head access mechanism for magnetic disk memory device.

## Abstract
A head access mechanism of the magnetic disk memory device for memorizing information by means of a rigid or flexible magnetic disk 12 . The head access mechanism is equipped with a moving coil type linear motor comprising an E shaped yoke means 10a,10b with two magnetic gaps 11a,11b and a movable coil. The yoke means 10a,10b is arranged so as to produce the two magnetic gaps 11a,11b side by side on the extension of the plane of placement of the magnetic disk 12 and or planes parallel to it, with their openings opposing the magnetic disk. A magnet 13a,13b is installed on each of the magnetic gaps to align the magnetic flux toward the central limb of the yoke means. The movable coil is wound through the two magnetic gaps 11a,11b encircling repeatedly around the central limb on which an indentation 14 is provided, which extends parallel to the magnetic gaps. A carriage 15 , which is mounted for movement in said indentation 14 and joined to said movable coil, supports the magnetic heads 18 so as to restrain the magnetic heads between the two magnetic loops that are formed by the pairs of magnets 13a,13b and the yoke means 10a,10b .
