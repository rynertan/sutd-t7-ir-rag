# ULTRA VIOLET LIGHT CURABLE COMPOSITIONS FOR ABRASION RESISTANT ARTICLES

## Abstract
Inherently highly abrasion resistant cast articles are prepared by polymerizing a composition comprising I as a first component from 0 to 100 parts of urethane polyacrylic ester and II as a second component, correspondingly from 100 to 0 parts of a composition containing A 45 to 60 by weight of a polyacrylic ester having 4 to 10 acryloyloxy groups, B 20 to 55 by weight of a polymerization shrinkage modifier, and C 0 to 30 of a diluent monomer. A source of free radicals may be added to the composition.
