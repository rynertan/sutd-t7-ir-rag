# Welding torch with vision attachment.

## Abstract
A gas tungsten arc welding torch 12 suitable for robot ic welding has an improved built in optical vision sensor 44 which images the weld puddle 13 and weld region on the face of a fiber optic cable the image is relayed to a video camera and computer to control the torch motion and weld process. The electric arc is much brighter than the area around the arc it is desired to image. A shaped blocking device 26 on the tungsten electrode 23 , such as a molyb denum sleeve or collet set back so that the arc is undistur bed, prevents the arc from being imaged and eliminates image distortions caused by the presence of the bright arc. Application to the welding of parts for nuclear energy plants.
