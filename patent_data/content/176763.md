# Liquid crystal device and method of driving the same.

## Abstract
In a liquid crystal device wherein a bistable ferroelectric liquid crystal 2 is sandwiched between display electrodes 21,22 a liquid crystal device and a driving method therefor characterized in that switching elements 1 are disposed at respective intersection points between a plurality of scan ning electrodes 5 and a plurality of signal electrodes 4 , and that at a juncture between said each switching element 1 and one of said display electrodes 21,22 , a control element 3 6 7 is disposed by which when said switching element 1 is off, an absolute value of a crest value of a voltage applied to said ferroelectric liquid crystal 2 is held less than a threshold value V
