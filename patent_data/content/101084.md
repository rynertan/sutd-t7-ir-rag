# A prefabricated, light reflecting, strip or tape form road marking material and methods of preparing same and component parts thereof.

## Abstract
This invention concerns a method for making prefabri cated, light reflecting, roadway marking strips resistant to the scraping action of mechanical, snow clearing equipment such as snow plows by the application of protruding elements on the marking strip. These elements can be of different shapes and are positioned on the marking strip so as to promote the snow plow blade to lift over the light reflecting elements, thus preventing, at least partially, the otherwise serious damage that could occur to the said light reflecting elements. The protruding elements are also designated to provide lifting points for the removal of the marking strip from installed locations on roadway surfaces. The light reflecting elements can also be mounted onto the protruding elements. This invention also concerns the method for manufactur ing the protruding elements, the method for the manufacture of the basic strip and the relative finished marking strip.
