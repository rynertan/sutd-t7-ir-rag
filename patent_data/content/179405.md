## Description
The present invention relates to a color printer having an apparatus for shifting an ink ribbon. More particularly, it relates to a color printer having an apparatus for swingingly shifting a ribbon frame on which an ink ribbon cassette is mounted, and simultaneously shifting transversely an ink ribbon in a serial printer, such as a wire dot printer for multi color printing by means of dots. Recently, multi color printing has become more and more in demand, and accordingly, a printing system has been developed for color printing with a color ink ribbon having a plurality of color stripes arranged along the transverse direction thereof and transversely shifting the ribbon. In such a printing system, the color printer and the shifting apparatus should be small and the shifting operation should be conducted smoothly and precisely. Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication kokai No. 58 12782 discloses a serial type color printer, in which a ribbon cassette accommodating a color ink ribbon is mounted on a printer base and a ribbon guide is mounted on a carriage so as to be movable up and down to shift the ink ribbon. However, in this printer, the ribbon cassette itself is not swingingly moved, but remains stationary on the printer base. Therefore, this printer is not appropriate for use with a multi color ink ribbon having a larger width thereof, since if the ink ribbon was moved or shifted for a long transverse distance, the ink ribbon would be misaligned, which would affect the smooth running of ribbon in the longitudinal direction thereof. In fact, this type of printer is usually used with a two color ink ribbon, such as a black and red ribbon, having two color stripes, in which the ink ribbon is shifted along a smaller transverse distance. Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication Kokai No. 59 182773 discloses a color printer, in which an ink ribbon cassette accommodating a color ink ribbon is carried on a carriage which is movable longitudinally along a platen. The ink ribbon cassette is also movable along the platen and swingingly shifted so that a desired color stripe of the ink ribbon is positioned on a predetermined printing line. However, in this printer, the ink ribbon is shifted in unison with the ribbon cassette and there is no ink ribbon guide for guiding the ink ribbon. Starting from this prior art it is the object of the present invention to provide a printer which is apt to work smoothly, fast and precisely with a multi color ribbon. This object is solved by the features of new claim 1. The invention shows the additional advantage that it can be realized in a very small and compact apparatus. Referring now to the drawings, a printer according to the present invention is generally shown in Fig. 1, in which reference numeral 10 indicates a base unit 20, a platen unit 30, a head carrier unit 40, a printing head 50, a ribbon supporting frame 70, a space motor assembly for driving the head carrier unit and 90, an ink ribbon guide. A cylindrical platen 21 is rotatably supported by respective left and right side plates 11a and 11b of the base unit 10 and driven by a sheet feed mechanism generally indicated at 22 to feed a printed sheet 2 in the direction indicated by an arrow A. The carrier unit 30 carries the printing head 40 and is reciprocally movable in parallel to the longitudinal direction of the platen 21, as will be mentioned later. The ribbon frame 50 is swingably supported by the respective side plates 11a and 11b about an axis parallel to the platen 21, as will be also described in detail later. Figure 2 illustrates a ribbon cassette assembly 60 which is used in the printer of this invention. An endless color ink ribbon 61 is accommodated in zig zag style in a ribbon case 62 and extends in a loop between respective arm portions 62a and 62b transversely projected from the cassette case 62 at its respective ends. At one end of the cassette case 62, a ribbon feed roller 63 is provided for feeding the ink ribbon 61 in the direction indicated by an arrow B, and a braking means 64, such as a leaf spring, is provided at the other end of the cassette case 62 for giving an appropriate tension to the ribbon 61. After the ink ribbon 61 is loaded, the cassette case 62 is covered with a lid 65 and placed on the ribbon supporting frame 50 Fig. 1 , so that the ink ribbon 61 is positioned between the platen 21 and the printing head 40 and in parallel to the platen 21, to be movable in parallel thereto along a ribbon guide 90 mounted on the head carrier 30, in Fig. 1. Figure 3 illustrates an example of the multi color ink ribbon 61, in which four color longitudinal ink stripes 61a, 61b, 61c, and 61d are arranged, in order from deep to light colors, for example, black, cyan, magenta, and yellow, respectively, in the direction of its width. As will be seen from Fig. 3, the width of black color stripe 61a, which is, in general, more frequently used, is larger than any one of the other color stripes 61b, 61c, and 61d, which are less used. Figure 4 is a view similar to Fig. 1, except that the ribbon supporting frame 50 Fig. 1 is omitted. The head carrier 30 is slidingly movably supported by a pair of parallel stay shafts 32 and 33 which are arranged in parallel to the platen 21 and rigidly secured to the left and right side plates 11a and 11b at their respective ends. Between these shafts 32 and 33, is arranged in parallel thereto an endless timing belt 34 which extends over a drive pulley 72 Figs. 5 and 6 of a step or pulse motor 71 and a tension pulley 37. The position of the tension pulley 37 is, of course, adjustable in the longitudinal direction to provide an appropriate tension to the belt 34. The head carrier 30 is connected to the timing belt 34 by means of belt clamp 38, so that the head carrier 30 reciprocally moves from one to the other end of the platen 21 along the stay shafts 32 and 33, when the step motor 71 Figs. 5 and 6 rotates in one or the other direction alternately. Figures 5, 6, and 7 illustrate a space motor assembly 70 including the above mentioned step motor 71, which also drives the ink ribbon 61 Fig. 2 by means of a ribbon feeding mechanism 73. As shown in Fig. 7, the ribbon feeding mechanism 73 comprises a gear 74 fixed to an output shaft 75 of the step motor 71. A two hand arm 80 is swingably mounted on the shaft 75 and carries first and second planetary gears 76 and 77 at the free ends thereof, respectively. The gears 76 and 77 have respective larger gear sections 76a and 77a which constantly engage with the gear 74 and respective smaller gear sections 76b and 77b. An idle gear 78 has a larger gear section 78a and a smaller gear section 78b which constantly engages with a drive gear 79. These drive and idle gears 79 and 78 and the gear 76 are arranged such that either the smaller gear sections 76b of the first planetary gear 76 directly engages with the drive gear 79 or the smaller gear 77b of the second planetary gear 77 engages with the larger gear 78a of the idle gear 78. Consequently, when the motor shaft 75 rotates in the clockwise direction in Fig. 7, the arm 80 swings in the same direction so that the smaller gear sections 76b of the first planetary gear 76 directly engages with the drive gear 79, while the smaller gear 77b of the second planetary gear 77 disengages from the larger gear 78a of the idle gear 78, as indicated by solid arrows C in Fig. 7. On the other hand, when the motor shaft 75 rotates in the counterclockwise direction in Fig. 7, the arm 80 swings in that direction so that the smaller gear sections 77b of the second planetary gear 77 engages with the larger gear section 78a of the idle gear 78, while the smaller gear 76b of the first planetary gear 76 disengages from the drive gear 79, as indicated by blank arrows D in Fig. 7. The drive gear 79 has a connecting pin 81, as seen from Figs. 1, 4, and 5 to 7, which protrudes onto the ribbon frame 50 Fig. 1 . The above mentioned ribbon feed roller 63 Fig. 2 is engaged by the connecting pin 81 when the ribbon cassette 60 is set on the ribbon frame 50 Fig. 1 . As can be clearly understood from the above, the ink ribbon 61 is always fed in the same direction, as indicated by the arrow B in Fig. 2, since the drive gear 79 rotates in the same direction as shown by the arrows C and D in Fig. 7, regardless of the rotating direction of the step motor 71. Figure 8 illustrates a ribbon shift mechanism, in which the ribbon frame 50 is swingably supported at the point shown by reference numeral 51 on the left and right side plates 11a and 11b of the base unit 10 so as to move swingingly about an axis parallel to the platen Figs. 1 and 4 , as mentioned above, by means of a ribbon shift motor 52 mounted on one of the side plates 11b through a timing belt 53. As shown in the Figure, the head carrier 30 carries a ribbon guide 90. In Figs 8, 9, and 10, the ribbon guide 90 has a pair of symmetrically arranged vertical guide shafts 91a and 91b each having a substantially L shaped horizontal cross section, as seen from Fig. 10, and a top end 40a of the printing bead 40 is positioned between the parallel parts of these shafts 91a and 91b. As seen from Fig. 9, the rear side parts of these shafts 91a and 91b, guide groove or corrugated configurations 92a and 92b are provided, as will be described later. At the outer sides of the shafts 91a and 91b, the ribbon guide 90 has a pair of symmetrically arranged parallel vertical guide shafts 93a and 93b for guiding a standard black ink ribbon 67 Fig. 10 , which may be accommodated in another ink ribbon case which has a size different from that shown in Fig. 2, but in the similar manner thereto. In addition, at the outer sides of these guide shafts 93a and 93b, the ribbon guide 90 also has a pair of symmetrically arranged parallel guide shafts 94a and 94b for guiding a color ink ribbon 61 as mentioned with reference to Fig. 2. The guide shafts 94a and 94b each has a longer or wider guide area corresponding to the width of the color ink ribbon 61. On the other hand, the guide shafts 93a and 43b each has a shorter or narrower guide area corresponding to the width of the standard black ink ribbon 67. In Figs. 8 and 9, a guide supporting bracket 41 is rigidly secured to the front end of the head carrier 30 through mounting slots 43a and 43b. The bracket 41 has two parallel vertical guide shafts 42a and 42b into which the above mentioned ribbon guide 90 is inserted through its guide slots 95a and 95b, which pass through the guide shafts 93a and 93b, respectively. Thus, the ribbon guide 90 is vertically movable along the guide shafts 42a and 42b, as shown by arrows M, in a manner as described later. A lock spring means 44 having a pair of resilient locking leaves 44a and 44b is rigidly mounted on the bracket 41 by means of a plate washer 45 and a screw 46 in such a manner that these locking leaves 44a and 44b are resiliently engaged with the corrugated guide grooves 92a and 92b, respectively. An indicator holder 47 is rigidly secured to the bracket 41 by means of screws 49. The holder 47 carries an indicator plate 48 having an lozenge shaped indicator slot 48a at the printing position, through which the printing head 40 prints on a printing sheet 2 on the platen 21 Fig. 1 via the ink ribbon 61 or 67. In Fig. 10, the color ink ribbon 61 extends through and over one 94a of the outer guide shafts, one 91a of the central pair of guide shafts, the other 91b of the central pair of guide shafts, and the other 94b of the outer pair of guide shafts. On the other hand, the standard black ink ribbon 67 extends through and over one 93a of the inner guide shafts, one 91a of the central pair of guide shafts, the other 91b of the central pair of guide shafts, and the other 93b of the outer pair of guide shafts. Thus, as seen from Fig. 10, the color ink ribbon 61 which has a larger width is guided and bent by these guide shafts by smaller angles so as to reduce the resistance which would be exerted on the ink ribbon 61 when it is guided to run therethrough. Conversely, the standard black ribbon 67 which has a smaller width is guided and bent by larger angles, since the resistance which would be exerted on it is naturally smaller because of its smaller width. Figure 11 illustrates a shift mechanism for shifting up and down the ribbon frame 50 on which an ink ribbon cassette 60 is mounted. This shift mechanism also shifts up and down the ribbon guide 90 Figs. 8 and 9 . The pulse or step motor 52 is rigidly mounted on the side plate 11b of the base unit 10 of the printer, as mentioned before. A driving pulley 52a is attached to the output shaft of the motor 52. An endless timing belt 53 extends from the driving pulley 52a to an idle pulley 57 rotatably mounted on the side plate 11b at a position above the driving pulley 52a. The rotational movement of the step motor 52 is limited by a stop semi disk member 54 attached to the output shaft of the motor 52 and a stop plate 55 adjustably mounted on the side plate 11b by a guide pin 55a and lock screw 55b through elongated slots of the stop plate 55. Consequently, the motor 52 is allowed to rotate from a position at which one end of the semi disk 54 is in contact with the stop plate 55 to a position at which the other end of the semi disk 54 is in contact with the stop plate 55. The timing belt 53 is connected to a connecting arm 58 through a belt clamp 56. The connecting arm 58 is adjustably connected to an elongated portion 50a of the ribbon frame 50. In other words, the arm 58 is pivotably connected to the portion 50a of the ribbon frame 50 at a pin 25, but rigidly secured thereto by a lock screw 27. An eccentric adjusting pin 26 is inserted into holes passing through the arm 58 and the elongated portion 50a. Therefore, the mutual relationship between the timing belt 53 and the ribbon frame 50 can be adjusted by rotating the eccentric pin 26 and fastening the locking screw 27. As will be understood from the above, the ribbon frame 50 is swingable, as shown by arrows H, about the pins 51 on the side plates 11a and 11b with the ink ribbon cassette 60, when the step motor 52 rotates in the direction indicated by arrows E in Fig. 11 by a predetermined angle via the timing belt 53, which is movable in the direction indicated by arrows F in Fig. 11, the belt clamp 56, the connecting arm 58, and the elongated portion 50a of the ribbon frame 50, in such a manner that a desired one of the color stripes 61a, 61b, 61c, and 61d Fig. 3 of the ink ribbon cassette 60 is positioned on the predetermined printing line. Figure 12 illustrates another embodiment of a connecting means for connecting the timing belt 53 to the elongated portion 50a of the ribbon frame 50. In this embodiment, the flat elongated portion 50a of the ribbon frame 50 has a pair of parallel elongaged slots 50b arranged in parallel to the timing belt 53. A U shaped connecting member 101 has a pair of legs 101a which are slidably inserted into the slots 50b. An adjusting screw 103 is inserted through the elongated position 50a and engaged with a thread hole 101c at the bottom 101c of the connecting member 101. A spring 106 is disposed between the bottom 101c of the connecting member 101 and the elongated portion 50a. The connecting member 101 has a pair of arms 101d protruded toward the timing belt 53 to form a U shaped configuration. On the other hand, a U shaped belt clamp member 104 has a plurality of slots 104a which facilitate the engagement with the corrugated configuration on the inside face of the timing belt 53. This clamp member 104 is rigidly connected to the arms 101d of the connecting member 101 by means of a connecting pin 105. As will be understood, the connecting member 101 can be movable in the direction indicated by arrows G in Fig. 12 and, thus, the mutual relationship between the timing belt 53 and the elongated portion 50a ribbon frame 50 in Fig. 11 can be adjusted by rotating a head 103a of the adjusting screw 103. In Fig. 13, the head carrier 30 is reciprocally movable along the stay shafts 32 and 33, as mentioned above. On this carrier 30, a shift lever 83 is mounted pivotably about a pivot pin 85 which is arranged just under, adjacent, and in parallel to the pivot shaft 51 of the ribbon frame 50. The shift lever 83 comprises a base portion 83a extending from the pivot pin 85 to the front edge of the ribbon frame 50, and two armed lever portions 83b, as also seen from Figs. 1 and 8, stepping over the printing head 40 and extending to the ribbon guide 90. The ribbon frame 50 carries under the front edge thereof a U shaped channel member 84 which extends along substantially the entire length of the frame 50 and is opened to the front side. On the other hand, on the shift lever 83 a roller 86 is mounted rotatably about an axis perpendicular to the pivot pin 85. The roller 86 is engaged with the channel member 84 so as to slidingly move therealong, when the head carrier 30 reciprocally moves along the stay shafts 32 and 33. At the front ends of the two armed portions 83b of the lever 83 provided are notches 83c, which engage with a pair of projections 96a and 96b Fig. 9 , respectively, of the ribbon guide 90. When the ribbon frame 50 is shifted or swingingly moved about the pivot shaft 51 as indicated by arrows I in Fig. 13 by means of the pulse motor 52 Figs. 8 and 11 , as mentioned above with reference to Figs. 11 and 12, the shift lever 83 follows to swing about the pivot pin 85 as indicated by arrows J, since the roller 86 carried on the lever 83 engages with the channel member 84 of the ribbon frame 50. Thus, the ribbon guide 90 is shifted up or down through the shift lever 83. However, since the corrugated guide groove configurations 92a and 92b Fig. 9 are resiliently engaged by the pair of spring leaves 44a and 44b, respectively, the ribbon guide 90 hops to move along the supporting shafts 42a and 42b of the blacket 41. Thus, a desired one of the color stripes 61a, 61b, 61c, and 61d Fig. 3 of the color ink ribbon 61 is selectively positioned on the printing line by the ribbon guide 90, as seen from Fig. 13. The pulse motor 52 Figs. 8 and 11 is advantageously energized slightly over a position at which the spring leaves 44a and 44b Fig. 9 resiliently engage with the guide grooves 92a and 92b, respectively, to facilitate the above mentioned hopping movement of the ribbon guide 90. The ink ribbon cassette 60 is set on the ribbon frame 50 in a manner shown in Fig. 11. In Fig. 11, the ribbon frame 50 has side walls 110 extending upward from its respective ends, each of which side walls has two notches 111a and 111b. On the other hand, the cassette case 62 made of any suitable plastic has at each of the respective sides thereof two projections 112a and 112b, which are resiliently engaged by the two notches 111a and 111b, respectively. Thus, when the color ink ribbon cassette 60 is mounted on the ribbon frame 50, the bottom of cassette case 62 is substantially in contact with the base surface of the ribbon frame 50. Figures 14 and 15 illustrate a detecting means of the ink ribbon cassette. As mentioned above, either the color or the monochromatic black ink ribbon cassette can be used in the printer of this invention. A black ink ribbon cassette 120 has a size different from that of the color ink ribbon cassette 60, and the width of the black ink ribbon 67 in smaller than that of the multi color ink ribbon 61, although the black ribbon cassette 120 can be mounted on the ribbon frame 50 in basically the same manner as the latter. However, the bottom of the black ribbon cassette 120 does not come into contact with the bottom surface of the ribbon frame 50, since the thickness of the black ink ribbon cassette 120 is smaller than that of the color ink ribbon cassette 60. In Figs. 14 and 15, the ribbon frame 50 has a bracket 113 rigidly secured thereto at the bottom thereof and an actuator lever 114 pivotably mounted on the bracket 113 about a pin 115, as shown by arrows K. The actuator lever 114 pivotably biased by a torsion spring 117 disposed between the bracket 113 and the lever 114, so that one end 114a of the lever 114 protrudes upward through a slot 116 provided in the bottom surface of the ribbon frame 50, until a stop portion 114b of the lever 114 comes into contact with the bottom of the frame 50. On the other hand, as seen from Fig. 15, a microswitch 118 is mounted on the side frame 11b by means of a bracket 119. When the ribbon frame 50 is unloaded, or loaded with the black ribbon cassette 120 the bottom thereof does not actuate the lever 114 , the actuator lever 114 is pivotably move by the spring 117 in the counterclockwise direction in Figs. 14 and 15, so that the other end 114c of the lever 114 comes into contact with the microswitch 118 to turn it ON. The microswitch 118 is connected to a control unit, not illustrated, which controls the ribbon shift motor 52 Figs. 5 and 11 to automatically set the ribbon frame 50 and ribbon guide 90 at their initial positions i.e., black ribbon printing mode , in which the ribbon guide 90 is in its upmost position so that setting the ink ribbon on the ribbon guide 90 can be easily carried out. When the color ink ribbon cassette 60 is loaded on the ribbon frame 50, the bottom of the cassette 60 comes into contact with the actuator lever 114 to pivotably move it in the clockwise direction in Figs. 14 and 15 about the pin 115 so that the other end 114c of the lever 114 is disengaged from the microswitch 118 to turn it OFF. Thus, the control unit sets this printer at a color ribbon printing mode. Figures 16, 17, and 18 illustrate a means for locking the ribbon frame at the black ribbon printing mode. Another actuator lever 121 is mounted pivotably about a pin 122 on a rear extended portion 50c of the ribbon frame 50. The lever 121 has one end 121a protruded upward through a slot 127 of the extension 50c and the other end 121b. The lever 121 is pivotably biased by a coil spring 124 disposed between the extension 50c at point 124a and the other end 121b of the lever 121 so that the one end 121a of the lever 121 protrudes upward through the slot 127 until a stop portion 121c of the lever 121 comes into contact with the lower surface of the extension 50c. A stop member 123 is also pivotably mounted about the same pin 122 and biased in the counterclockwise direction in Figs. 17 and 18, by means of a torsion spring 125 disposed between this stopper 123 and the actuator lever 121, until it is engaged by the acutator lever 121 at a position as shown in Fig. 17. When the color ribbon cassette 60 which has a smaller dimension in the tranverse direction than that of the black ribbon cassette 120 is mounted on the ribbon frame 50, the cassette 60 itself does not come into contact with the actuator lever 121, as seen from Fig. 16. However, when the black ribbon cassette 120 which has a larger dimension in the transverse direction is mounted on the ribbon frame 50, the actuator lever 121 is pushed and pivotaby moved about the pin 122 in the counterclockwise direction in Figs. 17 and 18 to allow the stopper 123 to pivotably move toward the side frame 11b of the base unit 10. On the other hand, the ribbon frame 50 is automatically shifted to the initial position by the step or pulse motor 52, as mentioned before. Therefore, the stopper 123 comes to fit into an opening edge 126 of the side frame 11b and engages therewith to lock the ribbon frame 50 at its initial position to prevent the shifting movement of the ribbon frame 50 when loading with a black ink ribbon cassette 120 which has a smaller ribbon width. When the black ribbon cassette 120 is removed from the ribbon frame 50, the actuator lever 121 is pivotably moved in the clockwise direction by the coil spring 124 so that the stopper 123 is also pivotably moved in the clockwise direction by the actuator lever 121 to come away from the slot 126 and allow the shifting movement of the ribbon frame 50.
