# Back pack.

## Abstract
There is provided a back pack having an internal frame consisting of a T shaped stay having its vertical member centrally positioned to overlie the user s spine. A load transmitting, flexible, one point connector extends between the pack bag, at the lower terminus of the frame, and the central rear segment of the hip belt. Stabilizer straps are provided to limit the movement of the pack bag. The one point flexible connector permits of universal relative movement between the hip belt and the frame and associ ated pack bag, thereby providing a high level of capacity in the back pack to accommodate the movements of the user.
