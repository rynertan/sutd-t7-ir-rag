# Drive mechanisms for machines.

## Abstract
A drive mechanism for a machine such as a machine tool or robot includes a rotatable shaft, e.g. a lead screw 4 or spindle 2 , drivingly connected with a movable element, e.g. a worktable 1 or tool support 2 , in the machine, a drive shaft 7 for rotation by a motor 5 and a coupling unit 8 , e.g. clutch 8 or gear transmission Fig. 2, 108 , for drivingly con necting the drive shaft 7 with the rotatable shaft 4 to move the movable element 1 in a predetermined form of move ment under a variable load in the machine. Encoders 10, 11 are provided in a rotation sensing relationship with the drive shaft 7 and the rotatable shaft 4 , respectively, to feed two trains of rotation responsive pulses into a differential counter 16 which provides a difference in angle of rotation signal representing an instantaneous torque produced at the drive coupling unit 8 between the drive and rotatable shafts 7, 4 . The differential signal and a preset signal set in a setting circuit 18, 19 , representing a predetermined value of torque are processed in an output circuit 17 which produces a con trol signal which is used to control the motor 5 or the coupl ing unit 8 so as to maintain the torque between the drive and rotatable shafts 7, 4 substantially at the reference value.
