# Zinc Alkaline Battery.

## Abstract
A zinc alkali cell composed of a negative electrode 2 comprising zinc as active material and an aqueous alkali solution as electrolytic solution, and a positive electrode 5 comprising manganese dioxide, silver oxide, oxygen or the like as active material, wherein the negative electrode comprises zinc alloy containing one of In, Al, and Mg and, in some cases, further containing one or both of Pb and Cd. The use of such zinc alloy serves to reduce the amount of mercury to be used on the surface of the negative electrode for the purpose of anticorrosion, thus providing a zinc alkali cell causing less environmental pollution.
