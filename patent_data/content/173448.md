# METHOD OF FORMING A III V SEMICONDUCTOR LAYER

## Abstract
A molecular beam comprising at least one group III element is directed at a semiconductor body within an evacuated cham ber. Simultaneously, a molecular beam comprising at least one group V element is directed at the semiconductor body to form a group III V semiconductor layer, the or a group V molecular beam being formed by decomposing a compound of tin and phosphorus with heat. The invention includes apparatus for forming such a layer, including means for forming a group III molecular beam 14, 15 and means for decomposing tin and phosphorus to form a group V molecular beam 20 and 22, both means being within an evacuable chamber 11.
