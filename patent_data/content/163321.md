# X ray tube apparatus.

## Abstract
An X ray tube apparatus comprises an X ray tube which includes a vacuum envelope and an anode target 8 and a cathode assembly 6 which are disposed within the vacuum envelope opposing each other. The cathode assembly has a flat plate like filament 20 for generating an electron beam, and a beam shaping electrode 40 insulated from this filament 20 . The beam shaping electrode 40 is formed with a beam limiting aperture 42 for passing therethrough a part of the electron beam emitted from the filament 20 , and a focussing dimple 44 so as to focus the electron beam. When d2 and a3 are assumed to represent the depth of the focussing dimple 44 and the distance between the target surface and the top surface of the focussing dimple 44 opposing this target surface, respectively, the value of the ratio of d3 to d2 satisfies the inequality 1.0 d3 d2 4.0.
