# Flush break blind bolt.

## Abstract
A blind fastener comprising a nut with an axial bore therethrough, a bolt extending through the nut with a sleeve encircling the bolt between the head of the bolt and the nut body, and a stop ring 38 provided on a screw threaded portion of the bolt, the bolt having a break groove 27 therein, between the nut body and the bolt head. As the bolt is advanced upwardly during installation, the stop ring abuts the terminal end of the nut body 14 . This sudden resistance to further travel causes the screw threaded portion to fracture at the break groove thus providing a clean break at the break groove substantially filling a cavity in the nut head thereby increasing the strength of the installed fastener and eliminating any need for shaving off the broken off screw threaded portion.
