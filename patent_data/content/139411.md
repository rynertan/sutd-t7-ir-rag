# Device for controlling the rotary movement of a platen.

## Abstract
A device for controlling the rotary movement of a platen roller 11 of a typewriter comprises a bidirectional electric motor 23 coupled to the roller by a worm 21 and wheel 20 and a pair of knobs 18, 19 which are disposed at the sides of the roller and which are rotatable with respect thereto. The knobs are fixed to a bar 16 which extends rotatably through the platen roller and carries a gear wheel 26 . Selective bidirectional rotation of the knobs causes corresponding rotary movement of a disc in a transducer 30 . The disc has a toothed sector 27 in mesh with the gear wheel 26 and is the moving part of a rotary switch which generates electrical signals which determine both the power supply to the electric motor 23 and the direction of rotation thereof. Small degrees of rotary movement of the knobs establish continuous rotary movement of the platen roller at low speed. A further slight rotary movement of the knobs establishes rotary movement of the roller at high speed.
