# Reflective objective apparatus.

## Abstract
A reflecting beam splitting objective employing only three mirrors obtains a high reflective efficiency. In one embodiment, the objective contains a small intercepting mirror 10 between primary 22 and secondary 12 mirrors of a Cassegrain mirror arrangement. The position of the intercepting mirror is determined so that the mirror receives an input beam and directs that beam onto a first portion of the secondary mirror without vignetting the beam when it is reflected from the secondary mirror to a first portion of the primary mirror or by cutting off part of the image transmitted from the second portion of the secondary mirror to a focus 34 behind the primary mirror. The objective may use all energy that is input into the objective to image a sample. The objective has particular utility in the field of infrared spec troscopy of small samples.
