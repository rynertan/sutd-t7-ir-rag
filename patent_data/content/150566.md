# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MAKING REFRACTORY ARTICLES

## Abstract
A braided preform fabrication for annular refractory arti cles such as an integral monolithic throat section 33 and exit cone 34 of a rocket motor nozzle is formed on a mandrel 10 and includes closely spaced radially oriented carbon rods 12 that extend to a uniform length from the mandrel surface and carbon fibers 17, 18, 19 braided on the surface of the mandrel around the carbon rods in a triaxial braid whereby the fabrica tion has a 4 D fiber architecture. The density of the fabrication is increased by a process that is repeated four times and in volves the steps of vacuum impregnation thereof with pitch, subjecting the impregnated preform 25 to high pressure at a temperature that is gradually increased to about 700 C to con vert the pitch to coke and to form the braided preform and mandrel into a billet 31 , and producing graphitization of the braided preform by subjecting the billet to an argon atmo sphere in a vacuum furnace at a temperature that is gradually increased to 2,500 C. The mandrel 10 is usually removed from the billet 31 by machining after the second repetition of the process, but it may be removed at any time after the braided preform structure 25 has acquired sufficient strength to withstand the temperature and pressure of further process ing.
