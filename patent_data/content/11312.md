## Abstract
A digital multiplex type vehicle electrical switching sys tem includes a transmitter and a plurality of receivers, each controlling a plurality of load devices L₁...L₄ . The transmitter produces a sequence of multibit digital words each including a plurality an address code bits and a plurality of utilization code bits. Each receiver recognises its own address code and accepts the associated utilization code. A command verifica tion logic circuit 58 is connected to recognise when the utilisation codes accepted by the receiver in successive cycles are identical. A fail safe circuit 66 operates to cause all the load devices L₁ to L₄ to be driven to predetermined safe condition in the event that the command verification logic circuit fails to produce a utilization code verified signal periodically.
