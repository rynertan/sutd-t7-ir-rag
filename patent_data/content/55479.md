# Electron beam pattern generation system.

## Abstract
Bit pattern data stored in an external memory unit 8 is read out under the control of a microprocessor 9 for being compressed in a data compressing unit 10 and then stacked in a memory unit 30 . At the time when storing data in the memory unit 30 , all the stripe data constituting one chip frame are written in a state capable being made high speed sequential access to at the time of the read out without need of dividing a memory bank into portions for the individual stripes but by continuously using the address space covering the entire memory areas. This is effected by a memory management unit and a memory module management unit provided in the memory unit 30 .
