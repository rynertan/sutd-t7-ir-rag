# APPARATUS FOR REPRODUCING DATA SIGNAL.

## Abstract
A data signal reproduction apparatus reproduces a data signal from a recording medium on which a digital data signal, which is processed according to run length limited code modulation, is recorded with a synchronizing signal portion. The apparatus is improved so that erroneous detec tion of the synchronizing signal is prevented when there is a defective part on the recording surface of the recording medium. The apparatus is arranged so that the supply of a rectangular wave reproduction signal from a waveform shap ing unit 9 to a reproduction signal processing unit 13 is inhibited when the amplitude of a read signal detected by an amplitude detection unit 14 to 17 is lower than a predeter mined value, thereby preventing erroneous detection of the synchronizing signal. The apparatus is suitable for the repro duction of a data signal from a digital audio disc.
