# OFFSHORE PLATFORM AND METHOD OF CONSTRUCTING, ERECTING AND DISMANTLING SAME

## Abstract
An offshore structure is provided which is adapted to be fabricated on shore as independent base and deck modules 11 and 12 , respectively. The base module 11 includes at least one buoyant section 20 . The buoyant section or sec tions provide buoyancy to the base module during water trans port and are flooded to sink and stabilize the base module on the water bottom at a desired offshore location. The base mo dule 11 includes three or more support columns 24, 25, 26, and 27 extending upwardly to adjacent the water surface 13 . The deck module 12 is affixed to the base module 11 and is supported by the base module above the water surface 13 .
