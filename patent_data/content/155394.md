# Line tracer accuracy control.

## Abstract
In a circular scanning pattern tracing system having a sample and hold circuit, the width of the sample pulse is made adjustable. This variable width is equivalent to a variable low pass filter in the system. The effective cut off frequency of the filter is made dependent on the system tangential tracing velocity.
