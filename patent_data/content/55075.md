# NEEDLE POSITION DETECTOR

## Abstract
A needle position detector for a sewing machine includes a pair of disk like members 15, 15A, 20, 16, 16A, 21 axially mounted on a rotary shaft 1 coupled to the armshatt of the sewing machine. Each of the disk like members is provided with an optically nonreflective portion 20, 21 occupying a greater area of its circumference and an optically reflective portion 15A, 16A occupying a smaller area of the circumfer ence. The disk like members are adjusted so that the angular positions of the respective light reflective portions correspond to the upper and lower needle positions. A light emitting ele ment 17A, 18A is associated with each of the disk like mem bers to emit light in a radial direction thereto. A light sensitive element 17B, 18B is also associated with each disk like mem ber to receive light reflected from the reflective portion of the associated disk like member to generate a needle position sig nal.
