# NEW, PERMANENT FLAME RETARDANT AND ANTI SMOULDERING COMPOSITIONS

## Abstract
When alkali metal and or alkaline earth metal tetraborates in a water suspension are suitably treated with ammonia and sulfuric acid, sulfurdioxide or phosphoric acid, they undergo a three step transformation resulting in a mixture of ammoni umpentaborate, the corresponding alkali metal and or alkaline earth metal salts s sulfate, sulfite or hydrophosphate and am monia Equation 1 . Alternatively, tetraborates undergo the same threestep reactions upon their treatment with equimolar amounts of am moniumsulfate, ammoniumsulfite or diammoniumhydrogen phosphate, while the liberated ammonia can be boiled off with distilling water. This application deals with the discovery of highly effec tive permanent flame retardent compositions which also pos ess excellent antismoldering, noncorrosive and fungal resis tant properties when properly applied and cellulosic fibers, cel lulose lignin fiber insulation materials.
