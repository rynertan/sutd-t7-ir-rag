# Thermally sensitive microbial rennin and process for its preparation.

## Abstract
Thermally sensitive microbial rennin and process for the preparation of thermally sensitive microbial rennin, comprising the treatment of the microbial rennin containing liquid, obtained after recovery of the fermentation broth, with a modifying agent, which enhances the termal instabi lity of microbial rennin, while retaining its milk coagulating activity at temperatures of normal cheese manufacturing, giving rise to easily decomposition of the microbial rennin in the residual liquids, obtained after cheese preparation, to be used for further food processing as well as the use of such obtained thermally sensitive microbial rennin for the cheese preparation and the use of the obtained whey for further food processing.
