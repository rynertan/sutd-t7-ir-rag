## Description
HETEROCYCLIC DERIVATIVES This invention relates to novel heterocyclic derivatives having action on histamine receptors, to processes for the preparation thereof, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to their use in therapeutics. Certain novel heterocyclic derivatives have now been found which have potent activity as H2 an tagonists. These compounds which are more particularly described below, for example show inhibition of the secretion of gastric acid when this is stimulated via histamine receptors Ash and Schild, Brit. J. Pharmacol. Chemother.1966, 27, 427 . Their ability to do so can be demonstrated in the perfused rat stomach using the method described in British Patent Specification No. 1,565,966, modified by the use of sodium pentobarbitone 50 mg kg as anaesthetic instead of urethane, and in conscious dogs equipped with Heidenhain pouches using the method described by Black et al Nature 1972 236, 385. Furthermore, the compounds antagonise the effect of histamine on the contraction frequency of isolated guinea pig right atrium. Certain compounds according to the invention have the advantage of an extended duration of action. Compounds with histamine H2 bloc king activity may be used in the treatment of conditions where there is an advantage in lowering gastric acidity, particularly in gastric and peptic ulceration, as a prophylactic measure in surgical procedures, and in the treatment of allergic and inflammatory conditions where histamine is a known mediator. Thus they may be used for example, either alone, or in combination with other active ingredients in the treatment of allergic and inflammatory conditions of the skin. The present invention provides compounds of the general formula I EMI2.1 and physiologically acceptable salts and hydrates thereof, in which R1 represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl, alkanoyl, aroyl or trifluoroalkyl group R2 represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl or alkenyl group or C26 alkyl group substituted by a hydroxy or alkoxy group, X represents a sulphur atom or NH Y represents an oxygen or sulphur atom or a bond m represents 1, 2 or 3 n represents 2, 3 or 4 A represents N and B represents CR3 or A represents CR3 and B represents N or A and B each represent N and R3 represents a hydroxy, hydroxyalkyl, alkoxyalkyl, acyloxylalkyl or CH NOH group or R3 represents the group CH2Z CH2 rR4 in which r is 1 to 4 when Z is an oxygen atom, or r is 1 when Z is a sulphur atom, and R4 isa CH2 group, the group CH C112, the group CH2NR5R6 where P5 and P6 are each alkyl or the group CH2NHR7 where R7 is alkyl or R3 represents an aralkyl or heteroaralkyl group in which the alkyl portion is optionally substituted by a hydroxy or acyloxy group or R3 represents the group CH2 qR8 where q is zero, 1, 2 or 3 and P8 is the group CH2NHC D NHR9 where D isNCN or CHNO2 and Rg is an alkyl group or the group COR10 where R10 is a hydrogen atom or a hydroxy, alkyl orNP11R12 group where R and R12 are the same or different and each represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group, or NRllRl2 forms a 5 or 6 membered ring or the group SO2R13 where R13 is an alkyl or aryl group or the groupNHSO2R14 where R14 is an alkyl group or the group NHCOP where R15 is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl, alkoxy, 15 15 aryl, heteroaryl or NHR16 group where R16 is an aryl, alkyl or cycloalkyl group or R3 represents the group CH2SR17 where R17 is an alkyl or heteroaryl group or R3 represents a C 2 4 straight or branched alkyl group substituted by two hydroxyl groups or the dihydroxyalkyl group may form a cyclic ketal structure of the formulaEMI3.1 where p is zero or 1, and R18 and Rl9, which may be the same or different, each represents a C14 alkyl group. In the above formula I the term alkyl as a group or part of a group means that the group is straight or branched and, unless otherwise stated, contains 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and in particular 1 to 4 carbon atoms, e.g. methyl or ethyl, and the term alkenyll means that the group has preferably 3 to 6 carbon atoms The term cycloalkyl means that the group has 3 to 8 carbon atoms. The term arylf as a group or part of a group preferably means phenyl or substituted phenyl, for example phenyl substituted with one or more C13 alkyl or C1 3 alkoxy groups, or halogen atoms, e.g. flourine. The term acyl means an aroyl, aralkanoyl or C16 alkanoyl group, e.g. acetyl, formyl, phenylacetyl or benzoyl. The term heteroaryl within the definition of R3 as an optionally substituted heteroaralkyl group or within the definition of R15 means a 5 to 6 membered monocyclic ring containing one heteroatom selected from oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur, e.g. thienyl, pyridinyl or furyl, optionally substituted by a C13 alkyl group. The alkyl portion of a heteroaralkyl group is a straight or branched C14 alkyl chain, and the heteroaryl ring is linked to the alkyl portion through a carbon atom. The term heteroaryll within the definition of R17 means tetrazolyl, triazolyl or thiadiazolyl optionally substituted by C 1 3 alkyl e.g. l methyltetrazol 5 yl . According to one aspect the invention relates to compounds of formula I in which A and B each represent N and R1 is other than a trifluoroalkyl group. According to another aspect the invention relates to compounds of formula I in which A represents N and B represents CR3 or A represents CR3 and B represents N m is I or 2 and n is 2 or 3 and R3 is other than the group CH2Z CH2 rR4 in which Z is an oxygen atom and r is 4, or Z is a sulphur atom and R4 is a CH2OH, CH2NR5Ró or CH2WHR7 group.

The invention includes the compounds of formula I in the form of physiologically acceptable salts with inorganic and organic acids. Particularly useful salts include hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, sulphates, methanesulphonates, acetates, maleates, succinates, citrates, tartrates, fumarates and benzoates. The compounds of formula I and their salts may also form hydrates, which hydrates are also to be considered as part of the invention. The compounds of formula I can exhibit tautomerism and the formula is intended to cover all tautomers. Where optical isomers may exist the formula is intended to cover all diastereoisomers and optical enantiomers. The present invention also extends to bioprecursors of the compounds of formula I .Bioprecursors are compounds which have a structure different to that of the compounds of formula I but which, upon administration to the animal or human being are converted in the body into a compound of formula I . The compounds according to the invention, preferably in the form of a salt, may be formulated for administration in any convenient way and the invention includes within its scope pharmaceutical compositions containing at least one compound adcording to the invention adapted for use in human or veterinary medicine. Such compositions may be formulated in a conventional manner using one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients.Such compositions may also contain if required other active ingredients, e.g. H1 antagonists. Thus the compounds according to the invention may be formulated for oral, buccal, topical, parenteral or rectal administration. Oral administration is preferred. For oral administration, the pharmaceutical composition may take the form of for example, tablets, capsules, powders, solutions, syrups or suspensions prepared by conventional means with acceptable excipients.For buccal administration the composition may take the the form of tablets or lozenges formulated in conventional manner. The compounds of the invention may be formulated for parenteral administration by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form in ampoules, or in multidose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilising and or dispersing agents.Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for reconstitution with a suitable vehicle e.g.sterile pyrogen free water before use. The compounds of the invention may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g. containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glyceride. For topical application, the compounds of the invention may be formulated as ointments, creams, gels, lotions, powders or sprays in a conventional manner. For internal administration a convenient daily dosage regime of the compounds according to the invention is I to 4 doses to a total of 5 mg to 1 g per day, preferably 5 to 500 mg per day, dependent upon the condition of the patient. It will be appreciated that in the methods for the preparation of compounds of formula I given below, for certain reaction steps it may be necessary to protect various reactive substituents in the starting materials for a particular reaction and subsequently to remove the protecting group. Such protection and subsequent deprotection may be particularly pertinent where R2 is an alkyl group bearing a hydroxy substituent and or when R3 contains a hydroxy or amino group. Standard protection and deprotection procedures can be employed, for example, amines may be protected by formation of a phthalimide group which may subsequently be cleaved by treatment with a hydrazine, e.g. hydrazine hydrate or a primary amine, for example methylamine.Hydroxyl groups may for example be protected by formation of ethers e.g.tetrahydropyranyl, or esters of carboxylic acids such as alkanoic acids,e.g.acetic acid, which may subsequently be removed by hydrolysis. In describing the processes which may be used for preparing the compounds of formula I or intermediates useful in the preparation thereof, any of R1 to Rl9, A, B, D, Alk, X, Y, Z, n, m, p, q and r in the various formulae are as defined in formula I unless otherwise stated. Compounds of formula I in which A or B is CR3 may be prepared by cyclisation of an appropriate intermediate. Thus compounds of formula I in which R3 is other than a dihydroxyalkyl group forming a cyclic acetal or cyclic ketal structure, or an aralkyl or heteroaralkyl group in which the alkyl portion is substituted by an acyloxy group, or acyloxyalkyl, CH NOH, SO2R13, COR10 where Rlo is hydrogen or alkyl , or the group CH2 qR8, where P8 is CH2NHC D NHP9 can be prepared by cyclisation of a compound of formula II EMI9.1 in which R20 is a group as defined for R2, V isEMI9.2 and Y is hydrogen where V is oxygen or sulphur and P3 a is a group as defined for R3 or a group convertible thereto under the conditions of the cyclisation reaction or V is NR2, R20 is hydrogen and Y isEMI9.3 where Y is oxygen or sulphur. Thus for example in an embodiment of the cyclisation process a compound of formula I in which A is N and B is the group CR3 may be prepared by cyclisation of a compound of formula III EMI10.1 where V represents sulphur or more preferably oxygen and U represents two hydrogen atoms, in the absence or presence of a solvent, e.g. a hydrocarbon such as toluene, a ketone such as acetone, an alkanol such as methanol, or water, and optionally with heating, for example, within the range 500 to 900. It may be convenient to prepare in situ compounds of formula III in which U represents two hydrogen atoms by treating a compound of formula III where U represents a divalent protecting group which can readily be removed to yield two hydrogen atoms, for example a benzylidene group, with an acid, e.g. hydrochloric acid, preferably with heating, and under such conditions cyclisation to give the corresponding compound of formula I will normally occur. In general intermediates of formula III may be prepared from the diamines of formula IV EMI10.2 by methods analogous to those described in British PatentSpecification No. 2047238A. Compounds of formula I in which A and B both represent N may be prepared by reacting an amine of formula TV preferably in the form of a salt, e.g. a hydrochloride, with a tetrazole of formula V EMI11.1 where L is a leaving group such as halogen, e.g. bromine, and P2, is the group R2 or a group convertible thereto.The reaction is preferably carried out with heating, for example within the range 80 to 2000C, in the absence or presence of a solvent such as an alkanol, e.g. butanol, optionally in a sealed vessel and preferably in the presence of a base such as triethylamine. The compounds of formula IV may be prepared as described in British Patent Specification No. 2001624A.The tetrazoles of formula V in which L represents a leaving group such as halogen are either known compounds or may be prepared by methods analogous to those described in British Patent Specification No.1364917 and G.B. Barlin, J. Chem. Soc., B , 1967, 641, e.g. by halogenation e.g. bromination of a compound of formula VI EMI11.2 Tetrazoles of formula VI are either known compounds or, when R2 is a hydroxyalkyl group or a group convertible thereto, may be prepared by reaction of a corresponding aminoalkanol derivative NH2 R2 with sodium azide and triethylorthoformate in the presence of a solvent such as acetic acid. Compounds of formula V in which L is a leaving group such as halogen, e.g. bromine or chlorine and R21 is tulle group CH2CH2OR20 where R20 is a hydrogen atom or a hydroxyl protecting group, e.g. tetrahydropyranyl ether, are novel compounds and represent a further aspect of the present invention. Compounds of formula I in which R3 is the group CH2 qR8 in which P8 is COR10 where R10 is hydrogen or alkyl, or SO2R13 may be prepared by oxidation of the corresponding compound in which R3 is the group CH2 qCHR10OH or CH2 qSR13. Thus aldehydes and ketones of formula I in which R3 is the group CH2 qCOR10 where P10 is hydrogen or alkyl may be prepared by oxidising the corresponding hydroxyalkyl compounds in which R3 is CH2 qCHR10OH using for example oxalyl chloride and dimethylsulphoxide, or activated manganese dioxide in a solvent such as dichloromethane. Compounds of formula I in which R3 is the group CH2 SO2R13 may be prepared by oxidising the corresponding compound in which R3 is CH2 qSR13 with for example peracetic acid or nitric acid. The reaction may be carried out in a solvent such as acetic acid, at room temperature. Starting materials in which R3 represents SR13 may be prepared from the corresponding compound in whichR3 is SH. These intermediates may in turn be prepared by cyclisation of a compound of formula III in which V a represents sulphur and R3 represents halogen e.g. chlorine. Compounds of formula I in which R3 is CH NOH may be prepared by reacting the corresponding aldehyde with hydroxylamine in a suitable solvent such as ethanol, optionally with heating. Compounds of formula I in which R3 is acyloxyalkyl, or R3 represents an aralkyl or heteroaralkyl group in which the alkyl portion is substituted by an acyloxy group may be prepared by reacting the corresponding alcohol with an activated derivative e.g.an acid chloride or an acid anhydride of an appropriate acid. The reaction may be carried out at room temperature, optionally in the presence of a solvent e.g. pyridine, tetrahydrofuran, acetone or dimethylformamide , and preferably in the presence of a base e.g. pyridine, triethylamine or an alkali metal carbonate such as potassium carbonate . Compounds oE formula I in which R3 includes the groupEMI13.1 may be converted into the corresponding compounds in which R3 includes the group EMI14.1 by reaction with a ketone RlsRlgCO, e.g.acetone in the presence of an acid, e.g. p toluene sulphonic acid. The reaction is carried out in the absence or presence of a solvent, e.g. benzene, at a temperature between room temperature and reflux. Compounds of formula I in which R3 represents the group CH2NHC D NHR9 may be prepared by treating the corresponding aminoalkyltriazole in which R3 is the group CH2 q 1NH2 with a compound of formula LC D NHRg, where L is a leaving group e.g. methylthio , The reactants may be mixed for example in an aqueous solution at room temperature. Where the product of any one of the above processes is a free base and an acid addition salt, in particular a physiologically acceptable salt is required, the salt may be formed in conventional manner. Thus, for example, a generally convenient method of forming the salts is to mix appropriate quantities of the free base and the acid in an appropriate solvent s e.g. an alcohol such as ethanol or an ester such as ethyl acetate. The invention also includes interconversion of one salt of the compound of formula I into another The invention is illustrated but not limited by the following Examples and Preparations, in which temperatures are in OC.
