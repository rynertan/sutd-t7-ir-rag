## Description
A MAGNETIC FILM CARRIER This invention relates generally to an apparatus for holding a film above a light source for printing thereof and more particularly but not by way of limitation to a magnetic film carrier for holding a film in place on top of a printer lamphouse. Heretofore there have been various types of negative and positive film carriers for holding film above a light source. Also, vacuum pressure has been used for holding a negative in place during the film processing such as a negative mounting plate described in U.S. Patent No.3,588,079. In the past, a magnetic film holder has been used for cameras and described in U.S. Patent No. 2,604,831. An object of the present invention is to provide an improved form of film carrier which is simple in design, easy to use and can be readily attached to a light source used in the printing of a film. According to the present invention there is provided a magnetic film carrier used in conjunction with a light source in a lamphouse of a photographic printer, the top of the lamphouse having a planar surface, the carrier comprising a flat metal plate having an aperture through the centre thereof a film holder mounted on top of the plate and adapted for holding the film above the aperture in the plate and magnetic means adapted for receipt in the lamphouse and around the light source and magnetically attracting and holding the flat metal plate on top of the planar surface of the lamphouse, the flat metal plate being movable in a plane parallel to the plane of the top of the lamphouse so that angular adjustments can be made thereon for misalignment of photographs and cropping of photographs. According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a magnetic film carrier used in conjunction with a light source in a lamphouse of a photographic printer, the top of the lamphouse having a planar surface, the carrier comprising a flat metal plate having an aperture through the centre thereof a film holder mounted on top of the plate and adapted for holding the film above the aperture in the plate a pair of elongated guide rails disposed on opposite sides of the light source and attached to the top of the lamphouse a slide slidably mounted on the guide rails, the slide having a slide frame with an aperture through the centre thereof, the top of the slide frame having a planar surface and a magnet mounted in the slide frame for magnetically attracting the plate to enable holding of the plate on top of the slide frame and above the light source when the slide is moved to one end of the guide rails, the plate being movable in a plane parallel to the plane of the slide frame so that angular adjustments can be made thereon for misaligned photographs and cropping of photographs. The subject invention uses magnetic attraction to hold a film in place above a light source used in the printing of the films. Consequently, the carrier may be rotated and offset at various positions on top of the light source when the picture on the film is misaligned or cropping of the picture is desired. As indicated above, the magnetic film carrier also provides a slide for moving the film adjacent the light source and above a viewing station prior to exposing the film above the light source. Embodiments of the present invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a magnetic film carrier in accordance with the present invention shown mounted on top of a lamphouse. FIG. 2 is a plan view. of the carrier. FIG. 3 is a plan view of the carrier with the carrier turned at an angle on the light source. FIG. 4 is an alternative embodiment of the carrier mounted on a slide and a pair of guides disposed on opposite sides of the light source and a viewing station. Referring to the drawings, Fig. 1 shows a magnetic film carrier designated by general reference numeral 10.The carrier 19 is disposed on top of a light source 12 which is part of a lamphouse 14 shown in dotted lines.The light source 12 includes a frame 15 therearound for centering the film to be printed thereon. The lamphouse 14 is part of a film printer 16 also shown in dotted lines and having a photographic lens 18. The lens 18 is disposed above the carrier 10 and light source 12. The film carrier 10 includes a film holder 20 mounted on top of a metal plate 22. The metal plate 22 has an aperture 24 in the centre thereof. The aperture 24 may be seen more clearly in FIGS. 2 and 3. The film holder 20 includes a pair of rollers 26 and 28, for guiding the film above the aperture 24 and exposing it to the light source 12. While the film holder 20 is shown, it should be appreciated that various types and designs of film holders could be used equally well for guiding the film past the aperture 24 in the plate 22. Disposed around the light source 12 is a magnet 30 for magnetically attracting and holding the metal plate 22 on top of the light source 12 in the lamphouse 14.The magnet 30 may be of various types of permanent magnets or as shown in FIG. 4 may be an electro magnet 32 having electrical wiring 34 connected to a power source, for energizing the electro magnet 32. In FIG. 2 the metal plate 22 is shown centred over the frame 15 on top of the lamphouse 14. The aperture 24 is also centred above the light source 12. In operation the film would be mounted on the rollers 26 and 28 with the rollers guiding the film past the aperture 24, for exposing the film to the light source 12. The metal plate 22 is also shown in dotted lines offset from the centre of the frame 15 and exposing a portion of the magnet 30. In FIG. 3 the metal plate 22 is shown turned so that the film on the film holder 20 may be positioned at an angle should there be misalignment of the picture on the film, or if it is desired, to crop the picture when it is printed on the film printer 16. Through the use of the magnet 30, the metal plate 22 may be easily turned at various angles on the frame 15 with the magnet 30 retaining the plate 22 in a desired position. The light source 12 is shown inFIGS. 2 and 3 through the aperture 24 in the metal plate 22. The film holder 20 in FIGS. 1 to 4 is shown without any film so that the aperture 24 in the plate 22 and the light source 12 can be seen. In FIG. 4, an alternative embodiment of the carrier 10 is illustrated wherein the carrier 10 includes a sl ide 36, having a slide frame 38 designed for receiving electro magnet 32 in the frame 38. While the electromagnet 32 is illustrated, a permanent magnet 30 or any other type of magnet could be used equally well. The slide 36 includes a pair of U shaped arms 40 which slidably engage a pair of parallel, elongated guides 42. The guides 42 are mounted on top of the lamphouse 14 and are disposed on opposite sides of the light source 12 and a viewing station 44. The viewing station 44 is also on top of the lamphouse 14 and adjacent light source 12. By sliding the slide 36 to the right on the guides 42 as shown in FIG. 4, the metal plate 22 with the film holder 20 is centred above the light source 12. In this position the slide 36 rests against a pair of steps 46 mounted on the ends of the guides 42. Prior to centering the carrier 10 above the light source 12, the carrier 19 may be moved to the left with the metal plate 22 and the film holder 20 centred above the viewing station 44. The viewing station 44 allows the operator of the printer 16 to view the film and centre the film on the film carrier 10, prior to exposing the film above the light source 12. As mentioned above, the metal plate 22 can also be turned easily or offset on top of the magnet 30, should it be necessary to adjust for alignment of the picture on the film carrier 10. Also, the magnet 30 may be of the type of magnet that is mechanically controlled as used on grinding machines. By turning a lever the magnetic attraction of the magnet 30 is released so that the metal plate 22 may be easily positioned on the lamphouse 14. By again turning the lever, the magnet 30 is activated and the metal plate 22 is securely held in place on the lamphouse 14.
