# GAS POWERED FLASHLIGHT

## Abstract
A hand held lighting device powered by a combustible gas stored in a self contained fuel chamber and utilizing an incandescent mantle for illumination, the lighting device being provided with a two stage fuel regulator for supplying vaporized fuel over a wide temperature range and in any orientation, an aspirated pilot assembly fixedly mounted within the lighting device adjacent the mantle and ignitable by an ignition assembly actuable from outside the housing, and a shock absorbing mantle mounting. The regulator includes a first stage for receiving a first flow of gas at a fuel chamber pressure and for producing therefrom a second flow of gas at a predetermined pressure difference lower than the first gas flow, and a second stage for receiving the second gas flow and producing therefrom a third gas flow at or below a predetermined pressure. The shock absorbing mantle mounting generally includes a two piece cantilevered member, the two pieces being slidingly and coaxially mated and biased with respect to one another.
