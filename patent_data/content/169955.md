## Description
TECHNICAL DESKThis invention relates to a technical desk, and more particularly to a desk utilizing a framework for supporting a desk top work surface and for containing electrical wiring, such as communication cables and utility wires and associated components. The invention is principally concerned with improving the handling of electrical wiring to provide maximum versatility in the routing of wires into and out of and within the desk, and for permitting the ganging together of desks and the routing of electrical wiring from one desk to another.In the past, panel systems of office furniture have been provided with attached raceways for the routing of electrical wires within the panels and from one panel to another. Desks have also been provided with arrangements for the passage of electrical wires therein and therethrough. Past systems, however, have been characterized by fixed routing of wires, and it has not been possible easily to adapt such systems to changing requirements. Thus, in the past, it has been necessary to gang together desks or panels in a specific configuration, e.g., front right corner of a desk to front left corner of an adjacent desk, in order to pass electrical wires from one desk to another. Ulrich U.S. patent No. 1,892,415 issued 27 Dec. 1932 is representative of such an arrangement. In the present invention, a basic framework for support of a desk top work surface is provided, together with channel elements defining wireways for holding electrical wires and associated components. The channel elements are releasably held by the framework, so that any of a large number of channel configurations may be achieved within the framework, thereby providing maximum versatility in the routing of electrical wires and associated components. While Hildebrant et al. U.S. patent No. 4,296,981 issued 27 October 1981 discloses a desk with a movable wiring channel therein, the channel is only movable from under the desk top to outside the top to facilitate placing wires in the channel. A system of channel elements, movable within the desk to provide varying raceways within the desk, as in the present invention, is not suggested by Hildebrandt et al.Other patents disclosing fixed wire management systems for desks are as follows Patent No. Name DateU.S. 1,350,658 Lawrence 24 Aug. 1920U.S. 1,786,823 Carrington et al. 30 Dec. 1930U.S. 1,905,402 Sink 25 April 1933U.S. 2,230,444 Balster 4 Feb. 1941U.S. 2,306,209 Elofson et al. 22 Dec. 1942U.S. 3,635,174 Ball et al. 18 Jan. 1972U.S. 3,783,175 Timmons 1 Jan. 1974U.S. 3,883,202 Konig 13 May 1975U.S. 4,053,701 Ogilvie et al. 11 Oct. 1977U.S. 4,066,305 Gazarek 3 Jan. 1978U.S. 4,094,256 Holper et al. 13 June 1978U.S. 4,323,291 Ball 6 April 1982 The present invention is also characterized by maximum versatility in routing wiring from one desk to another.Thus, in coupling one desk to another, an opening may be provided in a panel common to both desks. Releasably held shutters close off the panel opening, and selected shutters are removed to direct the wiring to and from particular locations in passing through the opening. In this way, the wiring from one desk may be routed at one level from beneath the top work surface of that desk through the common panel and out therefrom at another level below the top work surface of the adjacent desk the top work surfaces being positioned at different levels . None of the references above suggest such a movable shutter arrangement. Van Jessel et al.U.S. patent No. 3,787,605 issued 22 Jan. 1974 and BreidenbachU.S. patent No. 4,163,867 disclose wire holders sized to handle differing wire sizes in a wiring access opening in a desk, but there is no suggestion of such a movable shutter arrangement.In routing wires into or out of a desk, it may be desirable to utilize a conventional brush closure of an opening through which the wires pass, with hinging of a panel section to facilitate access. In the present invention, adjacent hingedtogether panel sections are covered by a single cover of material, e.g., flexible fabric, which is non adhered to the panel sections in the region of the hinging. In this fashion, the fabric forms a loose flap when one panel section is pivoted to an open position to facilitate wiring access. The flap disappears and the fabric is stretched tight, showing no hinge line, when the panel section is pivoted back to its normally closed position.U.S. patent No. 4,372,629 toPropst et al., issued 8 Feb. 1983, involves brush closure of a wiring opening using a pivoted member, but there is no suggestion of such a fabric covered panel section. By using a basic desk top supporting framework, with panel shutters and flexible preferably fabric covering of hinged panel section, as described above, a versatile system is provided. Versatility may be enhanced by providing for adjustable vertical positioning of the desk top supporting framework, thereby to position the desk top at any desired level.This adjustability may be provided by a track on a supporting panel, holding a support bracket structure, that in turn mounts the framework. The support bracket structure may be held by the track in any of a plurality of positions, but once in place is locked in position and cannot easily be moved, thereby to provide the necessary security required to satisfy applicable standards imposed by governmental authorities in connection with facilities involving electrical wiring.The invention will be more completely understood by considering a specific embodiment thereof described below, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is an exploded perspective view of a technical desk system embodying the invention. Fig. 2 is an exploded perspective view of a channel element used in the technical desk system of Fig. 1. Fig. 3 is an exploded perspective view of the underside of a portion of a desk top work surface used in the tech nical desk system of Fig. 1, showing how it is attached to its supporting framework. Fig. 4 is an exploded perspective view of a part of a sup port panel used in the technical desk system of Fig. 1, showing the details of a support plate structure used to mount the desk top supporting framework to that panel. Fig. S is an exploded perspective view of a part of a sup port panel used in the technical desk system of Fig. 1, showing the details of an opening therein for the passage of electrical wires and a plurality of releasably held shut ters selectively used to close off the opening. Fig. 6 is a transverse sectional view through the panel opening of Fig. 5, to a reduced scale, showing the passage of wires through the opening by the removal of selected shutters on opposite sides of the panel, and accommodating adjacent desk top work surfaces at differing levels. Fig. 7 and 8 are perspective views of a modesty panel used in the technical desk system of Fig. 1 and which is com posed of hinged sections, showing the details of a fabric covering for the panel which conceals the hinge line. Fig. 9 and 10 are perspective views of different arran gements of frameworks for supporting desk tops, as in the technical desk system of Fig. 1, showing how a plurality of such frameworks may be joined together to form networks of interconnected desks.Referring to Fig. 1, a presently preferred form of technical desk system embodying the invention is shown. There are two interconnected desks 20 and 22 in an L shaped configuration.Such a configuration is representative only, and is not intended to be limiting of the invention in any way. Each desk includes a framework 24 composed of side pieces 26 and transverse struts 28 . Preferably, but not necessarily, the struts and side pieces are of metal, welded together. The transverse struts 28 not only complete the framework but also serve as supports for channel elements 30. The channel elements 30 constitute wireways for holding electrical wires and associated components, such as flexible connectors 32, branching blocks 34, sockets 36, and the like. Some of the channel elements 30 are for holding electrical communication wires and associated components, while others are for holding electrical power distribution wires and associated components. The channel elements are releasably held by the transverse struts 28, as will be described in more detail below, and hence may be positioned in any desired configuration within the framework 24 to provide a very versatile user controlled system of wire management. The frameworks 24 support desk top work surfaces 38 and are themselves supported by panels 40 and 42. The panels 42 are modesty panels, and may be hinged to provide for wiring access as explained below. The interconnected panels and frameworks 24 provide a stable desk or multiple, interconnected desks. In the case of multiple desks, the panels 40 may include openings therethrough, closed by shutters 44 which are releasably held so that the opening from one desk to another may be varied, to provide user controlled passage of electrical wires from one desk to another.The technical desk system of Fig. 1 is illustrated more completely as to its various specific aspects in the remaining figures.Fig. 2 shows a typical channel element 30. It is U shaped in cross section, and may be madeof any convenient and suitable material, e.g., plastic. The channel element 30, which forms a raceway for holding electrical wires, may have cut outs therein not shown in Fig. 2 for the purpose of holding various components, such as branching blocks and sockets, to name some examples. If desired, the cut outs may be in the form of push out parts of the channel element, which has been stamped in areas thereof to weaken those areas, permitting the user to determine which specific cut out areas are needed, if any, in a particular installation. The channel element 30 includes end parts 46 that are shaped to interfit with the channel element and releasably held thereto.The end parts slide onto the ends of a channel element in a direction in line with the longitudinal axis of the channel element, and are releasably held in place by tabs 48 accommodated by associated slots 50 in the sides of the channel element. The tabs 48 bear against the sides of the channel element to hold the end parts 46 in place. Teach end part 46 includes adownwardly extending flange Si which fits against upwardly extending flange 52 of associated strut. 28 forming a part of framework 24. The flange S1 may include enlargements or tabs 54 on the inside surface thereof which engage with holes 56 in the flange of associated framework strut 28. Thus the end parts 46 are releasably joined to the framework struts by m6ve ment perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the channel member. The channel member 30 with affixed end parts 46 is snapped onto the associated struts 28 and will remain in position until the flange 51 with associated tabs 54 is disengaged from flange 52 by bending the flanges out of engagement, e.g., by prying the flanges apart using a screwdriver or similar tool.Separate end parts 46 are useful when it is desired to have channel elements 30 of differing lengths. It is possible, of course, to standardize to channel elements all of the same length, if desired. In the technical desk system ofFig. 1, the distance separating the two center struts 28 of a framework 24 is greater than the distance separating adjacent struts 28 at either end of the framework. Such strut separation is arbitrary, and the invention obviously is not limited thereto. Likewise, in the system of Fig. 1 certain of the channel elements 30 carry electrical sockets the longer channel elements , while others carry branching blocks to form branch circuits the shorter channel elements . Again, which channel element carries a particular component is arbitrary.What is desired is a versatile system in which maximum user determination of system configuration is achieved. Such is the case with the system of Fig. 1. The channel elements may be positioned virtually anywhere within the framework by a user, with the configuration changed, if necessary, to accommodate changes in equipment supported by the desk top work surface. Fig. 3 shows a representative attachment of table top work surface 38 to framework 24. Conveniently, a threaded insert 60 is included in the underside of the table top. A threaded bolt 62 passes through framework side piece 26 and secures the table top in place against the framework. The table top work surface 38 may be easily removed, as necessary, to gain access to the wiring underneath,Fig. 4 shows a representative attachment of framework 24 to supporting panel 40. A vertical edge of the panel includes slotted track 64, finished off by trim piece 66. Another trim piece 68 finishes off the top of the panel. A pair of brackets 70 and 72 formed respectively with upwardly directed lugs 74 and downwardly directed lugs 76 engage the slots of the track 64 at a level desired for the table top work surface.Next the framework 24 is attached to the brackets 70 and 72 by means of bolts 78 which pass through holes 80 and 82 in the brackets and are threaded into the framework 24. The upwardly and downwardly directed lugs 74 and 76 prevent the framework from moving either upwardly or downwardly, thereby locking the framework 24 in vertical position. Also, by notching the lugs, as at 84 and 86, horizontal movement of the lugs out of the track slots is prevented, adding further stability to the system. Such stability is desirable to meet code and other governmental requirements regarding stability of electrical raceway systems.Fig. 5 illustrates a window or opening 88 in panel 40 useful for the passage of electrical wiring from one desk to another. The window is closed off at each side of the panel by a plurality of shutters 90, although in Fig. 5 only one set of shutters at one side of the panel is shown for simplicity of illustration. The shutters 90 are each formed at their ends with U shaped parts 92 which engage tracks 94 in the panel. Each shutter includes at each end thereof a flexible inden tat ion 96 which engages a corresponding protrusion 98 between the tracks 94. In this way the shutters may be maintained in position on the track, even though one or more shutters are removed, as will be explained below. Each shutter 90 also is formed with a center part 100 which engages a corresponding support piece 102. The support piece stiffens the shutters and prevents them from bending or bowing. An extrusion 104 completes the assembly at the top.Fig. 6 shows how the shutters 90 are best used. Consider the situation illustrated in Fig. 6, when it is desired to pass electrical wiring from beneath desk top work surface 38a through panel 40.to beneath desk top work surface 38b, and the work surfaces are at different levels. In the representative arrangement shown in Fig. 6, the topmost shutter 90 on the left is removed, while the middle shutter on the right is removed, providing appropriate openings for the passage of wiring at different levels, as represented by line 106.Fig. 7 and 8 illustrate a modesty panel 42 in the technical desk. The panel is formed from two sections 42a and 42b, hinged together, as at 108. The panel section 42b is spaced from the edge of desk top 38, and a brush 110 bridges the space. The brush permits wires not shown to pass through the gap at any convenient location. To gain access to the wiring beneath the desk top 38, the panel section 42bis pivoted to the position shown in Fig. 8 from that shown inFig. 7. During such pivoting, flexible material 112, such as fabric, which covers the panel but which is not adhered to the panel sections in the region of hinge 108, forms a flap 112a. Thus the pivoting panel movement is permitted by the fabric, which is otherwise stretched tight and showing no hinge line when the panel sections are in the position shown in Fig 7. The panel section 42b may be retained in the closed Fig. 7 configuration by use of clips 114 on that panel section and associated catches 116 attached underneath the desi top 38.Fig. 9 and 10 show interconnected desk system configurations.In Fig. 9, an intermediate frame section 118 is used to bridge frame sections 120 and 122 in completing a right angled transition from desk frame 120 to desk frame 122. The frame 118 includes channels 124 and 126 for holding flexible connector 32. Obviously, any desired shape of intermediate frame element may be employed to bridge the transition from one desk frame to another involving any required angular difference between desk orientations 90 in Fig. 9 . In Fig. 10, an angular relationship of 1200 between desk top frames 130, 132 and 134 is maintained by intermediate frame sectional36 with its channels 138, 140 and 142.In conclusion, a technical desk of great versatility has been provided. Fixed ingress and egress locations for wiring are avoided by channel elements which are movable within an internal framework for supporting a desk top.While shuttered windows in panels with specific locations are employed, as at 44 in Fig. 1, unlimited passage of cables and the like is possible via the flexible conduits 144 in Fig. 1, which couple into the movable channel elements as desired.
