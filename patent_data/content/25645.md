# Dental reducing tool.

## Abstract
The tool comprises a shaft 18 , and a shank 20 . The shank 20 is grooved to define reducing elements 24 which may either lie in parallel planes normal to the axis of the shank 20 or on a helix. The groove 25 between adjacent reducing elements 24 has a rounded bottom wall 29 to reduce the accumulation of debris and to avoid weakening of the shank 20 . A coating of abrasive ma terial is applied to the reducing elements 24 to form an efficient cutting surface.
