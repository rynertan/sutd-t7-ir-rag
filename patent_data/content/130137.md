# Integral disk brake actuator and adjuster.

## Abstract
A brake wear adjuster 30 is mounted within the bore of an actuator piston 20 having a snap ring 46 at the entrance of the bore. The adjuster 30 includes a spring holder 42 having a uniquely configured washer 52 that is seated in a groove 50 in the outer surface of the holder. A spring 40 is carried about the holder between the washer 52 and a flange 42c at the opposite end of the holder. A pin 32 having a mounted swage 36 and a deformable swage tube 38 are carried within the bore of the spring holder 42, the swage tube 38 being movable with the holder 42 while the pin 32 and swage 36 are stationary. Upon hydraulic fluid pressure being applied to the piston 20, the snap ring 46 engages the washer 52 and it in turn compresses the spring 40 as it moves through the distance established in the groove 50. An occurrence of disk wear in the brakes causes the piston 20 and holder 42 to move further drawing the swage tube 38 over the swage 36. Upon release of the pres sure, the spring 40 moves the washer 52 and snap ring 46 and thus also the piston 20 to a retracted position to disengage the brake disks.
