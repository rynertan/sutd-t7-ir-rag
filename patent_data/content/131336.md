# Cathode ray tube.

## Abstract
In order to reduce contrast degradation in an electrostati cally scanned flat cathode ray tube 10 having a channel plate electron multiplier 44 , due to back scattered electrons 46 entering channels remote from their origin, steps are taken to restrict the acceptance angle of the channel plate electron multiplier. In one arrangement means are provided on the input surface to restrict the angle of entry to a range normally associated with the addressing electron beam arrow A . In another arrangement Figures 9A and 9B or Figure 10 the ready emission of secondary electrons is restricted to a pre determined arcuate portion ofthe input of each channel of the electron multiplier. In either arrangement stray electrons arrows B and C are unable to impinge upon the secondary emitting material 48 or surface in the channels and in conse quence produce many fewer back scattered electrons. Optionally a material 50 having a low back scatter coef ficient and a microscopically rough surface texture may be applied to the exposed surfaces, apart from the apertures, of the input side of the electron multiplier 44 .
