# Enhanced luminescent and luminometric assay.

## Abstract
An enhanced luminescent or luminometric assay, espe cially immunoassay, having a luminescent reaction between a peroxidase enzyme, an oxidant, a 6 hydroxybenzothiazole and a chemiluminescent 2,3 dihydro 1,4 phthalazinedione. The preferred materials are horse radish peroxidase as the enzyme, hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant, 6 hydroxy benzothiazole, 2 cyano 6 hydroxybenzothiazole or firefly luciferin as the benzothiazole and either luminol or isolumi nol as the phthalazinedione. In a particularly preferred embodiment the horse radish peroxidase is coupled to an antibody to the substance to be assayed and thereby acts as the assay label in an immunoassay.
