## Description
ANISOTROPIC MELT PROCESSABLE POLYESTER COMPRISINGRELATIVELY LOW CONCENTRATION OF 6 OXY 2 NAPHTHOYLMOIETY This invention relates to a melt processable polyester capable of forming an anisotropic melt. Although many aromatic polyesters are intractable materials aromatic polyesters which are capable of forming an an isotropic melt have been extensively described in the literature and in patents. Representative disclosures of anisotropic melt forming polyesters, poly ester amides , or poly ester carbonates which may include 6 oxy 2 naphthoyl moiety are present in US Patent Nos 4 161 470 4 219 461 4 256 624 4 279 803 4 299 756 4 318 841 4 318 842 4 330 457 and 4 337 190 and commonly assigned US SerialNos. 251 625, filed April 6, 1981 251 629, filedApril 6, 1981 287 345, filed July 27, 1981 and 319 024, filed November 6, 1981. In US Patent No. 4 219 461 a polyester is disclosed which comprises substantial concentrations of 6 oxy 2naphthoyl and 4 oxybenzoyl moieties and symmetrical dioxyaryl and symmetrical dicarboxyaryl moieties. In US Patent No. 4 299 756 a polyester is disclosed which comprises 6 oxy 2 naphthoyl moiety, 3 phenyl 4oxybenzoyl or 2 phenyl 4 oxybenzoyl moiety, 1,3dioxyphenylene moiety and terephthaloyl moiety. In US Patent No. 4 318 841 a polyester is disclosed which comprises 6 oxy 2 naphthoyl moiety, 4 oxybenzoyl moiety, the non symmetrical 1,3 dioxyphenylene moiety, and terephthaloyl moiety. The present invention provides a novel melt processable polyester which forms a highly tractable anisotropic melt phase below approximately 4000C in the substantial absence of polymer degradation unlike many polymers which include a relatively high concentration of 4 oxybenzoyl moiety. The polyester can be prepared on a more economical basis than that claimed in US Patent No.4 219 461 since it includes 6 oxy 2 naphthoyl moiety in a relatively low concentration. According to the present invention there is provided a melt processable polyester capable of forming an anisotropic melt phase at a temperature below approximately 4000C comprising the recurring moieties I,II, III and IV wherein I isEMI2.1 II isEMI2.2 III is a symmetrical dioxyaryl moiety of the formula O Ar Owhere Ar is a divalent radical comprising at least one aromatic ring which optionally may include substitution of at least some of the hydrogen atoms present upon an aromatic ring selected from the group consisting of an alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, an alkoxy group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, halogen, phenyl, substituted phenyl, and mixtures of the foregoing, and IV is dicarboxyaryl moiety of the formula EMI2.3 where Ar is a divalent radical comprising at least one aromatic ring which optionally may include substitution of at least some of the hydrogen atoms present upon an aromatic ring selected from the group consisting of an alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, an alkoxy group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, halogen, phenyl, substituted phenyl, and mixtures of the foregoing, wherein the polyester comprises approximately 3 to 15 mole percent of moiety I, approximately 20 to 70 mole percent of moiety II, approximately 7.5 to 38.5 mole percent of moiety III, and approximately 7.5 to 38.5 mole percent of moiety IV. The melt processable polyester of the present invention comprises at least four recurring moieties which when combined ih the polyester have been found to form an atypical highly tractable anisotropic melt phase at a temperature below approximately 4000C, and preferably below approximately 3700C e.g. below approximately 3500C in a particularly preferred embodiment . In those instances when the polyester is sufficiently crystalline the polymer melting temperature may be confirmed by the use of a differential scanning calorimeter i.e. DSC employing repeat scans at a 200C per minute heat up rate and observing the peak of the DSC melt transition. In those instances when the polyester is substantially amorphous it exhibits no melting peak which is readily discernible by differential scanning calorimetry.Because of its ability to exhibit anisotropic properties i.e.liquid crystalline properties in the melt, the polyester readily can form a product having a highly oriented molecular structure upon melt processing. Preferred polyesters are capable of undergoing melt processing at a temperature in the range of approximately 3200 to 3900C.The usual difficulties incurred when one attempts to melt process many aromatic polyesters by conventional melt processing techniques effectively are eliminated. The first essential unit i.e. moiety I of the polyester, of the present invention is a 6 oxy 2 naphthoyl moiety of the structural formula EMI4.1 Such moiety is free of aromatic ring substitution and is present in a relatively low concentration as discussed hereafter. As will be apparent to those skilled in the art, moiety I can be derived from unsubstituted 6 hydroxy 2naphthoic acid and the derivatives thereof. A convenient laboratory preparation for forming 6 hydroxy 2 naphthoic acid is described in Berichte, Vol. 58, 2835 45 1925 byK Fries and K Schimmelschmidt which is herein incorporated by reference. Also, US Patent No. 1 593 816 is concerned with a process for synthesizing 6 hydroxy 2 naphthoic acid by reacting carbon dioxide with the potassium salt of beta naphthol. Moiety I comprises approximately 3 to 15 mole percent of the polyester. In a preferred embodiment moiety I is present in a concentration of approximately 5 to 10 mole percent e.g. 5 or 10 mole percent . The presence of moiety I in the polyester of the present invention even in such low concentrations has been found to significantly lower the melting or softening temperature of the resulting polyester thereby making possible the use of more conventional melt extrusion equipment and processing conditions than would otherwise be required. For instance, if moiety I were eliminated and the concentrations of the other moieties correspondingly increased, the melting temperature of the resulting polyester commonly would be approximately 300 to 800C higher. Such lowering of the melting temperature in the polyester of the present invention is accomplished in combination with the ability to form a highly tractable anisotropic melt. The relatively low concentration of moiety I makes it possible to obtain a polyester with these attractive properties at minimum cost. The second essential moiety i.e. moiety II of the polyester of the present invention is a 4 oxybenozyl moiety of the structural formula EMI5.1 Such moiety is free of ring substitution and is present in a substantial concentration. For instance, moiety II is present in a concentration of 20 to 70 mole percent. In a preferred embodiment moiety II is present in a concentration of approximately 50 to 65 mole percent e.g. 50 or 60 mole percent . The third essential moiety i.e. moiety III of the polyester of the present invention is a symmetrical dioxyaryl moiety of the formula O Ar Owhere Ar is a divalent radical comprising at least one aromatic ring. Moiety III is symmetrical in the sense that the divalent bonds which join this moiety to other moieties in the main polymer chain are symmetrically disposed on one or more aromatic rings e.g. are para to each other or diagonally disposed when present on a naphthalene ring . Moiety III optionally may include substitution of at least some of the hydrogen atoms present upon an aromatic ring selected from the group consisting of an alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, an alkoxy group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, halogen, phenyl, substituted phenyl, and mixtures of the foregoing. However in a preferred embodiment moiety III is free of ring substitution and the concomitant expense associated therewith. Preferred moieties which may serve as the symmetrical dioxyaryl moiety in the polyester of the present invention include EMI6.1 and and mixtures of the foregoing. Particularly preferred symmetrical dixoyaryl moieties are EMI6.2 which may be derived from hydroquinone and its derivatives, andEMI6.3 which may be derived from p,p biphenol and its derivatives. Representative examples of ring substituted compounds from which moiety III may be derived include methyl hydroquinone, chloro hydroquinone, and bromohydroquinone. Moiety III is present in the polyester of the present invention in a concentration of approximately 7.5 to 38.5 mole percent, and preferably in a concentration of approximately 12.5 to 22.5 mole percent e.g. 17.5 or 20 mole percent . The fourth essential moiety i.e. moiety IV of the polyester of the present invention is a dicarboxyaryl moiety of the formula EMI7.1 where Ar is a divalent radical comprising at least one aromatic ring. The Ar of moiety IV may be EMI7.2 wherein the divalent bonds are meta and or para disposed which join this moiety to other moieties in the main polymer chain. Moiety IV optionally may include substitution of at least some of the hydrogen atoms present upon an aromatic ring selected from the group consisting of an alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, an alkoxy group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, halogen, phenyl, substituted phenyl, and mixtures of the foreging. However, in a preferred embodiment moiety IV is free of ring substitution and the concomitant expense associated therewith. Preferred moieties which may serve as the dicarboxyaryl moiety in the polyester of the present invention include EMI8.1 and and mixtures of the foregoing. In a particularly preferred embodiment moiety IV is approximately 40 to 90 mole percent e.g. approximately 50 mole percent of isophthaloyl moiety and approximately 10 to 60 mole percent of terephthaloyl moiety e.g.approximately 50 mole percent . In another particularly preferred embodiment moiety IV is all terephthaloyl moiety and is incorporated in conjunction with a 4,4 dioxybiphenyl moiety of moiety III. In a further particularly preferred embodiment moiety IV is all isophthaloyl moiety and is incorporated in conjunction with 1,4 dioxyphenylene moiety. Moiety IV is present in the polyester of the present invention in a concentration of approximately 7.5 to 38.5 mole percent, and preferably in a concentration of approximately 12.5 to 22.5 mole percent e.g. 17.5 or 20 mole percent . When isophthaloyl moiety is present as all or as a portion of moiety IV in the polyester of the present invention, it is preferred that the total molar concentration of moiety I plus the molar concentration of isophthaloyl moiety does not substantially exceed approximately 25 mole percent of the polyester. Other ester forming moieties e.g. dioxy units, dicarboxy units and or other combined oxy and carboxy units than those specified for moieties I, II, III and IV additionally may be included in the polyester of the present invention in a minor concentration.Representative additional ester forming moieties may be derived from substituted hydroxynaphthoic acids, mhydroxybenzoic acid, substituted hydroxybenzoic acids, cycloaliphatic dicarboxylic acids, etc. Amide forming moieties also may be included in the polyester of the present invention in a minor concentration.Representative reactants which may form such amide forming moieties include m aminophenol, p aminophenol, maminobenzoic acid, p aminobenzoic acid, mphenylenediamine, p phenylenediamide, etc. The additional ester forming moieties and or amide forming moieties optionally may be included in the polyester of the present invention so long as such moieties do not raise the melting temperature of the resulting polymer above that spcified, or do not otherwise interfere with the exhibition of the desired anisotropic properties in the melt. The total minor concentration of such additional ester forming and amide forming moieties if present generally will be less than 10 mole percent of the total polymer. The polyester of the present invention is preferably wholly aromatic in the sense that each moiety present contributes at least one aromatic ring to the main polymer chain. The polyester of the present invention commonly exhibits EMI10.1 orEMI10.2 end groups depending upon the synthesis route selected.As will be apparent to those skilled in the art, the end groups optionally may be capped, e.g. acidic end groups may be capped with a variety of alcohols, and hydroxyl end groups may be capped with a variety of organic acids. For instance, end capping units such as phenylester EMI10.3 and methylester EMI10.4 optionally may be included at the end of the polymer chains. The polymer also may be oxidatively cross linked to at least some degree, if desired, by heating in an oxygen containing atmosphere e.g. in air while in bulk form or as a previously shaped article at a temperature below its melting point for a limited period of time e.g.for a few minutes . The polyester of the present invention tends to be substantially insoluble in all common polyester solvents, such as hexafluoroisopropanol and o chloropehnol, and accordingly is not susceptible to solution processing. It can surprisingly be readily processed by common melt processing techniques as discussed hereafter. Most compositions are soluble in pentafluorophenol. The wholly aromatic polyester of the present invention commonly exhibits a weight average molecular weight of about 2000 to 200,000, and preferably about 10,000 to 50,000, e.g. about 20,000 to 25,000. Such molecular weight may be determined by standard techniques not involving the solutioning of the polymer, e.g. by end group determination via infra red spectroscopy on compression moulded films. Alternatively, light scattering techniques in a pentafluorophenol solution may be employed to determine the molecular weight. The polyester prior to heat treatment additionally commonly exhibits an inherent viscosity i.e. IV of at least 0.6, and preferably at least 1.0 e.g. approximately 2 to 8 when dissolved in a concentration of 0.1 percent by weight in pentafluorophenol at 600C. In some embodiments the polyester of the present invention may be considered crystalline in the sense that fibres melt extruded therefrom exhibit x ray diffraction patterns using Ni filtered CuKss radiation and flat plate cameras characteristic of polymeric crystalline materials. In other embodiments the polyester of the present invention is substantially amorphous. The aromatic polyester of the present invention in all instances may be easily melt processed. Unlike the aromatic polyesters commonly encountered in much of the prior art, the polyester of the present invention is not intractable and forms an an isotropic melt phase whereby an atypical degree of order is manifest in the molten polymer. The subject polyester readily forms liquid crystals in the melt phase and accordingly exhibits a high tendency for the polymer chains to orient in the shear direction. Such anisotropic properties are manifest at a temperature which is amenable for melt processing to form shaped articles. Such order in the melt may be confirmed by conventional polarized light techniques whereby crossed polarizers are utilized.More specifically, the an isotropic melt phase may conveniently be confirmed by the use of a Leitz polarizing microscope at a magnification of 40X with the sample on a Leitz hot stage and under a nitrogen atmosphere. The polymer melt is optically anisotropic, i.e. it transmits light when examined between crossed polarizers. The amount of light transmitted increases when the sample is sheared i.e. is made to flow however, the sample is optically anisotropic even in the static state. The polyester of the present invention may be formed by a variety of ester forming techniques whereby organic monomer compounds possessing functional groups which upon condensation form the requisite recurring moieties are reacted. For instance, the functional groups of the organic monomer compounds may be carboxylic acid groups, hydroxyl groups, ester groups, acyloxy groups, acid halides, etc. The organic monomer compounds may be reacted in the absence of a heat exchange fluid via a melt acidolysis procedure. They, accordingly, may be heated initially to form a largely melt solution of the reactants wherein some reactants such as terephthalic acid initially are present to some degree as solids. Low levels of terephthalic acid may dissolve under such circumstances.The polymer sometimes is suspended therein as solid polymer particles. A vacuum may be applied to facilitate removal of volatiles formed during the final stage of the condensation e.g. acetic acid or water . In US Patent No. 4 067 852 there is described another slurry polymerisation process which may be employed to form the polyester of the present invention wherein the solid product is suspended in a heat exchange medium. The disclosure of this patent is herein incorporated by reference. When employing either the melt acidolysis procedure or the slurry procedure of US Patent No. 4 067 852 the organic monomer reactants from which moieties I, II andIII are derived may be initially provided in a modified form whereby the hydroxyl groups of these monomers are esterified i.e. they are provided as acyl esters . The lower acyl groups preferably have from about 2 to about 4 carbon atoms. Preferably the acetate esters of the organic compounds which form moieties I, II and III are provided. Accordingly, particularly preferred reactants for the condensation reaction are 6 acetoxy 2 naphthoic acid, 4 acetoxybenzoic acid, and hydroquinone diacetate or 4,4 diacetoxybiphenyl. Representative catalysts which optionally may be employed in either the melt acidolysis procedure or in the procedure of US Patent No. 4 067 852 include dialkyl tin dioxide e.g. dibutyl tin oxide , diaryl tin oxide, titanium dioxide, alkoxy titanium silicates, titanium alkoxides, alkali and alkaline earth metal salts of carboxylic acids, the gaseous acid catalysts such as Lewis acids e..g BF3 , hydrogen halides e.g. HC1 , etc. The quantity of catalyst utilized typically is about 0.001 to 1 percent by weight based upon the total monomer weight, and most commonly about 0.01 to 0.2 percent by weight. The molecular weight of a previously formed polyester may be further increased via a solid state polymerisation procedure wherein the particulate polymer is heated in an inert atmosphere e.g. in a nitrogen atmosphere at a temperature of about 2400C for 10 to 12 hours. The polyester of the present invention readily can be melt processed in the substantial absence of polymer degradation to form a variety of relatively stiff shaped articles, e.g. moulded three dimensional articles, fibres, films, tapes, etc. The polyester of the present invention is suited for moulding applications and may be moulded via standard injection moulding techniques commonly utilized when forming moulded articles. Unlike the polyesters commonly encountered in the prior art it is not essential that more severe injection moulding conditions e.g.higher temperatures , compression moulding, impact moulding, or plasma spraying techniques be utilized.Fibres or films may be melt extruded. A moulding compound may be formed from the polyester of the present invention which incorporates approximately 1 to 60 percent by weight of a solid filler e.g. talc and or reinforcing agent e.g. glass fibres . The polyester of the present invention also may be employed as a coating material which is applied as a powder or from a liquid dispersion. Fibres formed from the polyester of the invention may be used with particular advantage as tire cords and in other industrial applications, such as conveyor belts, hose, cabling, resin reinforcement, etc. Films formed of the polyester of the present invention may be used as strapping tape, cable wrap, magnetic tape, electric motor dielectric film, etc. The fibres and films exhibit an inherent resistance to burning. The following examples are presented as specific illustrations of the claimed invention. EXAMPLE 1 To a 300 ml three neck round bottom flask equipped with a sealed paddle stirrer, gas inlet tube, and a distillation head connected to a condenser were added the following a 11.51 grams of 6 acetoxy 2 naphthoic acid 0.05 mole b 49.54 grams of 4 acetoxybenzoic acid 0.275 mole c 16.99 grams of hydroquinone diacetate 0.0875 mole d 7.27 grams of isophthalic acid 0.04375 mole e 7.27 grams of terephthalic acid 0.04375 mole f 0.0046 gram of potassium acetate catalyst.

The contents of the flask were heated to 2800C and were maintained at 2800C for 30 minutes. At the end of such heating a total of 25 ml of acetic acid had been collected. The temperature was next raised to 3200C and was maintained at 3200C for 10 minutes, and was raised to 3400C and maintained at 3400C for 20 minutes. At the end of such heating a total of 28 ml of acetic acid 98 percent of theory had been collected.Finally the flask was evacuated to a pressure of 0.4 Torr for 10 minutes at 3600 C. The vacuum was released with dry argon, and the contents of the flask were allowed to cool. The inherent viscosity IV of the polymer was approximately 2.13 as determined in a pentafluorophenol solution of 0.1 percent by weight concentration at 600C. When the polymer was subjected to differential scanning calorimetry 200C min heating rate , it exhibited a second order glass transition temperature of 1100C and no observable melt endotherm since it was largely amorphous.The polymer melt was optically anisotropic.
