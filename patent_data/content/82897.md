# Tool for cutting optical fibres.

## Abstract
An improved tool for cutting optical fibers by the scribe and break technique is disclosed. The tool has a scribing edge 18 transversely directed with respect to, and normally spaced from, an arcuate convex fiber supporting surface 22 . When moved normally with respect to the fiber supporting surface 22 , the scribing edge defines a scribing plane. Spring members 14 , located on opposite sides of the scribing plane, are compressed between the fiber supporting surface 22 and a bearing surface 16 , causing the optical fiber 60 to be clamped between the spring members 14, 30 and the fiber supporting surface 22 . This compression also forces the spring members 14 to slide longitudinally along the fiber supporting surface 22 away from the scribing plane, imparting an axial tensile stress to the optical fiber 60 . The optical fiber 60 is finally scribed by the scribing edge 18 resulting in propagation of a fracture over the cross section.

## Description
TOOL FOR CUTTING OPTICAL FIBERS The present invention relates to an improved tool, and more particularly a hand tool, for performing the scribeand break technique, a method employed to cut optical fibers which yields fiber ends that are smooth, flat, and perpendicular to the fiber axis. To achieve efficient transmission of energy light signals through an optical fiber splice, the fiber ends must be smooth, flat, and perpendicular to the fiber axis. It is generally known that the scribe and break technique adequately yields the desired fiber ends. Basically, this technique involves stretching an optical fiber over an arcuate surface and lightly scribing the fiber with a sharp edge to produce a fracture which is diametrically propagated through the fiber to produce the requisite end surface. Hand tools currently in use to scribe and break optical fibers are both complicated in design, that is, having many moving parts, and expensive. See, for example, U.S. PatentNos. 4,154,385 4,159,793 4,168,026 and 4,202,475. Since such tools are likely to be used in harsh field environments, with each tool expected to withstand repeated duty cycles, it is therefore imperative that their construction be durable, and readily repairable. Moreover, it is desirable for scribe and break tools to be of simple design, and accordingly inexpensive, since loss of tools in field applications in not uncommon. A tool for cutting optical fibers by the scribe andbreak technique in accordance with the present invention includes an arcuate convex fiber supporting surface.Normally spaced from, and transversely directed with respect to, the fiber supporting surface is a fiber scribing edge, which, when moved normally with respect to the fiber supporting surface, defines a scribing plane. Facing toward, and normally spaced from the fiber supporting surface is a bearing surface. Spring members, which both grip and tension the optical fiber, are located on opposite sides of the scribing plane between the bearing and fiber supporting surfaces. As these two surfaces are moved relatively toward each other, the spring members compress, causing the optical fiber to be clamped between the fiber supporting surface and a gripping portion of each spring member Further compression of the spring members causes the gripping portions to move longitudinally along the fiber supporting surface in opposite directions away from the scribing plane.This longitudinal motion imparts an axial tensile stress to the optical fiber Finally, while under both bending and axial tensile stresses, the optical fiber is lightly scribed by the scribing edge, resulting in propagation of a fracture over the fiber cross section. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a tool for scribing and breaking an optical fiber which results in a smooth, flat perpendicular end. It is another object of the present invention to provide a tool for scribing and breaking an optical fiber which is relatively simple in design with few moving parts. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a tool for scribing and breaking an optical fiber which can be readily and economically manufactured.

FIGURE 5 is a section through the tool showing an optical fiber in the scribing position. A hand tool 10 for cutting optical fibers by the scribe and break technique in accordance with the present invention, Figures 1 and 2, comprises an anvil 12, a spring member 14, a bearing surface 16 having a scribing edge 18 centrally mounted thereon see Figure 3 , and a prismoidal frame 20. The anvil 12 has a fiber supporting surface 22 of arcuate convex shape extending between opposite ends 22, and a second surface 26 opposed to the fiber supporting surface 22. The spring member 14 is an elongated plate formed to surround the anvil 12 having U shaped free ends 28 located on opposite sides of a scribing plane defined by the scribing edge 18. The spring member 14 extends symmetrically from the scribing plane to gripping portions 30, then to end portions 32 which wrap around the opposite ends 24 of the anvil 12, and finally to a longitudinal portion 34 which is located adjacent to the second surface 26 of the anvil 12.Each end portion 32 has a fiber receiving slot 36, and the longitudinal portion 34 has a deformable concave portion 38. The bearing surface 16, which faces the fiber supporting surface 22 with the spring member U shaped Tree end portions 28 therebetween, has adjustable mounting means 40 such as a pair of nut, bolt and resilient washer assemblies as shown or an equivalent substitute familiar to those skilled in the art. The prismoidal frame 20 encloses the anvil 12, spring member 14, and bearing surface 16. The frame 20 has a top side 42 having a pair of holes 44 to accept the mounting means 40, a bottom side having an aperture 48 large enough to provide thumb or finger access, a back side 50, and a front side 52 having a slot 54 through its entire length.The frame 20 also has opposed ends 56 each having a fiber receiving slot 58. Referring to Figure 3, the operation of cutting an optical fiber is initiated by inserting the optical fiber 60 through the front side slot 54 and into the spring member fiber receiving sluts 36 and the frame end fiber receiving slots 58. Optionally, either the spring member fiber receiving slots 36 or the frame end fiber receiving slots 58 are designed to transversely align the optical fiber 60 on the fiber supporting surface 22. During insertion of the optical fiber 60, the spring member 14 is in an unactuated condition. Referring to Figure 4, the spring member 14 is actuated by application of a normal force, using a thumb or finger, to the deformable concave portion 38. This force causes the anvil 12 to move relatively toward the bearing surface 16 and scribing edge 18, compressing the spring member U shaped free end portions 28 between the bearing surface 16 and the fiber supporting surface 22. As the free end portions 28 are compressed, the gripping portions 30 clamp the optical fiber 60 to the fiber supporting surface 22. Additionally, in resisting compression, the U shaped end portions 28 move in opposite directions away from the scribing plane as the gripping portions 30 slide longitudinally along the fiber supporting surface 22, imparting an axial tensile stress to the optical fiber 60. This process continues until the optical fiber 60 is brought into contact with the scribing edge 18, as in Figure 5. At this point, the optical fiber 60 is under both a bending and axial tensile stress which yields a net decreasing tensile stress across the fiber cross section.The optical fiber 60 is lightly scribed by the scribing edge 18, resulting in propagation of a fracture. The scribing edge 18 can be rotated slightly about the scribing plane using the adjustable mounting means 40. Such adjustment may be critical in achieving a clean fracture, especially after the scribing edge 18 has been worn from use. Further, the scribing edge 18 can be replaced when worn beyond use simply by dismounting the bearing surface 16 from the top side 42 and installing a new one.
