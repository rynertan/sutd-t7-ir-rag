# Sheet transport apparatus.

## Abstract
A sheet transport apparatus picks up and transports a topmost sheet 25 of a stack of sheets in a one by one manner. A suction drum 29 with a cylindrical member 29a rotating in a cyclic manner picks up the leading edge of the topmost sheet 25 by suction force when the cyclindrical member 29a is substantially in a momentary stop state. A stationary separation suction head 26 disposed adjacent the stack in the transport direction separates by suction force any sheets underlying the topmost sheet 25 undesir ably picked up by the operation of picking the topmost sheet 25 from the stack. A belt conveyor system 71a, 72a disposed adjacent the stationary separation suction head 26 in the transport direction gradually grasps the leading edge of the sheet 25 picked up by the suction drum 29 while the trailing portion of the grasped sheet 25 is also attracted by the suction drum means 29 so that a slight tension is given to the sheet 25 until it is firmly held and transported by the belt conveyor system.
