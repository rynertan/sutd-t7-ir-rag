# Method of measuring the moisture content of a material.

## Abstract
An apparatus and a method for moisture measurement are disclosed wherein a transmission means 2 is utilized in conjunction with a circuit means 3 connected in shunt with the transmission means 2 and adapted to receive a material to be tested such that the driving point impedance of the cir cuit means 3 is dependent upon the moisture content of the material.
