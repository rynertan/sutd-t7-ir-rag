# Method and device for remote tissue identification by statistical modeling and hypothesis testing of echo ultrasound signals.

## Abstract
For remote identification of tissue types the scattering of ultrasound energy from living tissue is modeled as an auto regressive or autoregressive moving average random pro cess. Autoregressive or autoregressive moving average models of candidate tissue types are generated from pulse echo data that is known to come from that particular tissue type. Kalman prediction error filters 220 are used for each candidate tissue type to generate estimates of the probability In p Zn Hi that an unknown pulse echo signal belongs to the class generated by that tissue type i . Unknown pulse echo signals are filtered in a specific Kalman filter 220 to test the hypothesis that the unknown signal belongs to the class associated with that particular Kalman filter.
