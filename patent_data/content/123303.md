A method that has given good results, consists in reacting the compound of formula II with chlorosulfonic acid in an inert solvent such as chloroform, at a temperature ranging between 10 and 400C. Other literature methods that can be applied, are the ones de scribed by R.V. Hoffmann in Organic Synthesis O.L.Chapman publisher volume 60, pages 121 126 1981 and by H.A. Young in Journal Am. Chem. Soc. 59, 811 1937 .The benzo furan sulfonic acids of formula III are then converted into the corresponding sulfonic chlorides Reaction 2 and from these into the sulfonamides of formula V Reaction 3 which are new compounds.Both reaction 2 and reaction 3 are carried out according to modalities, which are well known in literature. The conver sion of the sulfonamides of formula V into the corresponding isocyanates or isothiocyanates of formula VI Reaction 4 can be carried out according to different known techniques.Among these techniques the following ones can be cited the reaction of sulfonamides with an alkyl isocyanate follo I wed by phosgenation of the resulting urea LH.Ulrich et al, J. Org. Chem. 31, 2658 1966 3 the reaction of sulfonamides with chlorosulfonyl isocyanate R. Appel et al, Chem. Ber. 107, 706 1974 1 the reaction of sulfonamides with oxalyl chloride and subse quent pyrolysis of the resulting sulfonyl oxaloyl chlorides in dichlorobenzene LJ.E. Franz et al, J. Org. Chem. 29, 2592 1964 i The first two processes are burdensome owing to the cost of the employed reactants and owing to the long operations re quired to isolate the product. Should the sulfonamide not be soluble in oxalyl chloride, the third process could not be applied binder the conditions, as described be the author. Therefore it was necessary, in the present case, to modify the operational conditions described by J. E. Franz, by reac ting the sulfonamide with an excess of oxalyl chloride in ortho dichlorobenzene at temperatures comprised between 90 and 1800C. The excess of oxalyl chloride is removed by distillation as reaction goes on, till the distillation temperature of the solvent is reached. Finally reaction 5 of scheme 1 is carried out by reacting isocyanate VI with aromatic amine VII suspended in an inert solvent such as acetonitrile or methylene chlo ride at room temperature and in the presence of catalytic amounts of a tertiary amine.The starting products of the reactions of Scheme 1, and na mely the dihydro benzofuran derivatives of formula II, are known compounds or they can be prepared according to known techniques. The preparation of some compounds of formulaII can require a specific synthesis, which will be illustra ted shortly hereinafter, for the following structures EMI8.1 II A, Rê, R ed R4 H, CH3 II B, R4 H, CH3 EMI8.2 EMI8.3 II D, R ed R2 H, C113 II E, R3 ed R4 H, CH3 EMI9.1 11 F, R ed R N, CH 3 The preparation of the compounds of formula II A is carried out by means of the following reactions EMI9.2 Reaction 6 is a Claisen transposition that is carried out, for instance, according to what is described in OrganicReactions , vol. II, chapter 10 1944 and vol. 220, chapter 1 1975 The cyclization of intermediate VIII Reaction 7 was de scribed in Organic Reactions vol. II, chapter 10 1944 .In such a reference one states to use hydrobromic acid or formic acid as catalyst.According to our present experience we state as more conve nient, at least in some cases in particular when R2 CH3 , to carry out reactions 6 and 7 in only one stage, by heating the starting products between 150 and 2200C in the presence of catalytic amounts of magnesium chloride.The preparation of the compounds of formula II B can be carried out starting from the compounds of formulaEMI10.1 t hrough transformation of amino group into diazo and radi calic cyclization of diazo derivative in the presence of tributyl tin hydride n.C4H9 3 Sn H according to the me thod described by A.L.J. Beckwith et al, J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Comm. 136 1981 . The compounds of formula II C are prepared from compounds of formulaEMI10.2 by dehydration and cyclization according to methods known in literature, for instance Fries, Pfaffendorf Berichte 45, 156 1912 .The preparation of compounds of formula II D can be carried out by internal condensation of the compounds of formula X according to reaction 8 EMI10.3 wherein X OH or a halogen atom Cl, Br . Reaction 8 can be carried out under the conditions descri bed by Fries, Hasselbach e Schroeder, Angewandte 405, 370 1914 .Alternatively the compounds of formula II D can be prepared by condensing the suitable phenol with the chloride of a 2 chloro alkanoyc acid XI under Friedel and Crafts con ditions and by cyclizing the resulting product XII in the presence of a base according to the following reactions EMI11.1 The compounds of formula II E can be prepared, according to procedures analogous to the ones described for the prepara tion of compounds II C, by intemolecular condensation of the corresponding 2 2 hydroxyfuryl alkanoyc acids of for mulaEMI11.2 Finally the preparation of the compounds of formula II F can be carried out by catalytic hydrogenation of the carbo nyl group of the compounds of formula II D to methylene. As hereinbefore retorted, the compounds of formula I are endowed with a high herbicide activity and other positive characteristics, which allow the use of such compounds in the agrarian field for protecting useful cultivations against weeds.These characteristics can be summarized in a high and versatile herbicide action, in a wide spectrum of action and in the selectivity towards agrarian cultivations.In fact, the compounds of formula I are active towards a lot of species of weeds, in particular against the dicoty ledons and exhibit a herbicide activity both during the preemergence treatments and, mostly, during the post emergen ce treatments.In the meanwhile the compounds of formula I prove to be se lective towards important agrarian cultivations such as the cereals.For the practical uses in agriculture the compounds, object of the invention, may be used as such or, according to the normal practice, in the form of a suitable composition.In the compositions, besides the compound of formula I as active substance, inert carriers may be present, which may be both solid and liquid and optionally other additives of agrarian use.According to the normal formulative practice the compositions may be in the form of liquid concentrates, emulsifiable concentrates, suspensions, formulates in powder or in wet table powder and granular formulates.If desired, to deal with specific situations it is possi ble to add to the compositions other active substances use ful in agriculture such as fertilizers, fungicides or other weed killers.The amount of compound of formula I to be used for protec ting useful cultivations against the weeds depends on dif ferent factors. Among these we can cite the kind and the degree of infestation, the kind of treatment pre emergen ce or post emergence , the respective effectiveness of the specific product of formula I, that is used, also in func tion of the above mentioned factors, the kind of cultiva tion to be weedded and climatic and environmental factors.In general, satisfactory results are obtained by using an amount of compound of formula I ranging between 0.1 and 3 Kg ha.The invention will be now better illustrated by the follo wing examples.EXAMPLE 1Preparation of 2,3 dihydro 2,2 dimethyl 5 nitro 7benzofuransulfonic acid.
