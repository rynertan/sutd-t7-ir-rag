## Description
VENTILATION APPLIANCE The invention concerns a ventilation appliance comprising at least two igglrltonnrdl vertical group of louvre element plates in alternately opposed arrangement, both longitudinal edges of each louvre element being provided with a hook shaped, brcklfold formation, both formations being located on the same face of the louvre element end in staggered opposition to those of the adjacent element whereby the internal protrusion of the formations causes a zig zag pattern of the through flowing air. A similar appliance is recognssed in the French patent application no 515.568. With the recognized appliance the problem anise that the alternately opposed vertical louvre elements, having a semi circular section, cause contractions and expansion In the airstream and deflect the through flowing air in such a way that turbulence occur in the airstream which is intended to promote separation of liquid particles entrained in the airstream.This turbulence in fact increases the resistance of the appliance to the through flow of air, which should be kept to a minimum, whilst the water trapped by the vertical louvre elements is re entrained into the airstream by the air turbulence formed and by pressure forces acting on the external face of the appliance The aim of the invention is to eliminate these disadvantages and to ensure maximum water removal without detriment to the airflow capacity This aim is fulfilled by the invention and the invention is thus typified in that the vertical louvre elements have a straight section and are arranged in staggered opposition, formed in groups.Each adjacent group gives rise to an equal unrestricted air passage, whilst the hook shaped edge formations, each folded inward in the same direction, ensure that the entering airflow is led through the louvre elements with maximum streamlining, whereby the turbulence is kept to a minimum and maximum airflow capacity is assured. Due to the zig zag path of the main air through flow the water droplets carried in the airstream will be separated out onto the outer bends by the relatively high centrifugal forces. In this way the optimal conditions are achieved for the apparently conflicting requirements of maximum ventilation coupled with maximum possible weather proofing. The invention is further illustrated below by means of a drawing in which a number of examples of possible forms of construction of the ventilation appliance are shown according to the inventionThe drawing indicates in fig. 1 A perspective view of a construction of a ventilation appliance according to the invention fig. 2 A section through a louvre according to the invention fig. 3 A partial longitudinal section through a ventilation appliance provided with louvres according to the invention fig. 4 A lateral section through the line IV IV of fig. 3. fig. 5 A partial longitudinal section through a ventilation appliance provided with louvres as in fig. 3, but including in this case a third louvre with a hook shaped back fold formation on een longitudinal edge. Figure 1 is a perspective view of a construction of a ventilation appliance in a possible mode of operation. Figure 2 is a lateral section through a louvre 90 depicted in a possible operating mode. The louvre is a part manufactured from rolled sheet metal and has a flat plate formed part 100 that is provided with a channel shaped part 101 running along one edge, and another channel shaped part 102 which runs along the opposite edge of the louvre, interconnected. Parts 101 and 102 are both on the same side of part 100 and have straight sides. Parts 101 and 102 have hooks 103 and 104 on the longitudinal edges of the louvre, in addition, parts 101 and 102 combined form a pair of straight, evenly spaced sides 105 and 106 and these sides are placed at a 900C angle to part 100. Parts 103 and 104 form a drainage channel for accumulated water droplets, which are separated out onto part 100 of the louvre by centrifugal forces. Figure 3 is a partial longitudinal section through a ventilation appliance provided with louvres according to the invention, whereby a group 107 of louvres 90, as applied in figure 2, arranged in staggered opposition, while their backs 100, also staggered, are fixed by means of a rivet andlor spot welding 110. The louvres 90 of group 107 form together a defined zig zag pattern which is caused by the shape of parts 103 and 104 thus creating an optimal passage of air. The side 108 of parts 103 and 104 ensures that the separated water droplets are not re entrained into the airstream 109 in case of turbulence occuring in parts 103 and 104. The parts 103 and 104 of the louvres in group 107 form drainage channels with inlet opening 123 which runs along the longitudinal edges of the louvres 90 in order to collect and drain water droplets which have been separated by the tangential action through airways 111 and deposited on the louvres 90. channels 103 and 104 are connected at the end underneath with the bottom plate 112 in order to drain the water to outside. Figure 4 shows a lateral section through the line IV IV of figure 3.The louvres 90 are fixed to the top plate 113 and bottom plate by means of supports 114 and 115. Bottom plate 112, constructed at an angle of 150c for draining, has a flat plate formed part 116 with a channel shaped part 117 that forms an angle of 1050C with part 116. The side 118 of part 117 ensures that the entrapped water is not driven by wind pressure upward into the space behind it. The side 119 is at an angle of 1050C with part 116, and ensures effective drainage of the entrapped water droplets. The part 120, situated on the front edge of louvres 90, forms a windbreak which aims to prevent wind driven up flow of the entrapped water droplets. The presence of windbreak 120 causes a pocket of still air directly behind part 120. The drainage of the entrapped water droplets is accelerated by the dynamic pressure from outside 121 .Furthermore windbreak 120 combined with side 119 forms a drain 122 which can be connected into a central drain if necessary. Figure 5 shows a partial longitudinal section through a ventilation appliance provided with louvre as according to the invention as in figure 3, but including a third louvre 90 with a hook shaped back fold formation on one longitudinal edge 103 and at the same time fixed by the backs 100 by means of a rivet and or spot welding 110. A ventilation appliance equipped with louvres as in figure 5 is primarily completely resistant to extreme weather conditions. Zn place of roll formed construction the louvres can also be extruded or manufactured in another suitable manner, and furthermoreIn any suitable material. The louvres can additionally be made out of plastic sheeting.
