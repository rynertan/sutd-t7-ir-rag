# A device for the water feeding and for the filtering of the coffee infusion in coffee machines particularly of automatic type.

## Abstract
A device for the distrihution under pressure of the hot water in coffee machines, in particular for the water feeding to the chamber containing the coffee powder, the filtering of the obtained coffee infusion and its coming out. The hot water under pressure, fed by the pipe 5 , passes through the hole 6 overcoming the action of a nonreturn valve 10 and is brought into the delivering chamber 2 on the below coffee powder 14 through duct 8 and the port 13 as well as through the port 12 of the hole 9 respectively. When the infusion is already partially obtained, it is pushed to pass through the crown betiveen the filter ing disk 15 and the delivering chamber 2 and through the crown between the hole 16 and the shut ting element 17 , being the total passing surface of the infusion equivalent to the optimum surface of the usual filters.
