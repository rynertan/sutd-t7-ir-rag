# VALVE DEVICE INCORPORATING A SWITCHING MECHANISM

## Abstract
The invention comprises an improved override and an interrelated valve system. A main valve has an actuator, the actuator in turn having a control for communicating a control signal to the actuator for selectively causing the actuator to place the main valve in its open or closed position. The override is associated with the main valve and selectively shiftable between an engaged mode in which the override is operatively connected with the main valve for moving the main valve between its open and closed positions, and a disengaged mode in which the operative connection be tween the override and the main valve is interrupted, whereby the main valve may move independently of the override. A shut off functionally interconnects the override and the actuator control and is operative, upon shifting of the override to its engaged mode, to block the control signal from the actuator.
