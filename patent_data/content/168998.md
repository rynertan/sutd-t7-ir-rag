# Multi axis load transducer.

## Abstract
A strain gage type load sensor 78 having a central disc 82 with a plurality of radially outwardly extending spokes 86, 88, 90, 92 each having the ends thereof flexurally at tached to an outer annular reaction portion by means of a pair of oppositely directed beams 94, 96 98, 100 140, 142 144, 146 extending from the spokes at right angles thereto for flexually suspending the central disc from the annular por tion. A plurality of upstanding posts 156, 158, 160, 162 sup porting a common block 164 . The beams and posts are strain gaged for sensing bending loads. In another embodiment, two central discs 36, 38 are stacked axially with each suspended by connection of the spokes to the annular reaction portion 42, 44 . A first group of strain gages is disposed at mid radius of the spokes for sensing radial tension and compression strains in the spokes. A second group strain gages is disposed at the inner and outer spoke ends for sensing bending strains in the spokes.
