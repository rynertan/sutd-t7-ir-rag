## Description
NUCLEAR REACTOR This invention relates to nuclear reactors and has particular relationship to reactors in which a coolant, typically water at critical temperature and pressure, is circulated through the nuclear core disposed in a reactor vessel. The core includes the fuel and is arranged in the lower region of the reactor vessel. In addition, the reactor includes control rod assemblies. Control rod assemblies include control rods, supports for the control rods, drive rods for a number of control rods and other related components. The core with its fuel assemblies is usually referred to as the lower internals of the reactor.The control rods and rod guides are referred to as the upper internals of the reactor. The control rods are movable between the upper internals and recesses or thimbles in the core by the drive rods. The control rods are mounted in clusters on their drive rods by means of spiders. There are rod clusters RCC s in which the rods have a high absorption cross section for neutrons. These clusters are used to reduce the power or shut down the reactor and are moved between the core and their guides a number of times during the fuel cycle of a reactor. There are so called gray control rods of substantially lower neutron absorption cross section than the high absorption RCC s and they serve for load follow or to moderate or control the power of the reactor. Gray rods are moved between the core and the guides many times typically 5,600 , substantially more than the high absorption RCC s, during the fuel cycle of a reactor.There are further water displacement clusters WDRC s . These rods are of the same diameter as the RCC s. They are used to maintain the amount of water coolant in the core relatively high during early operation of the reactor and to permit the amount of the water coolant in the core to increase during the later operation of the reactor by removal of the displacement rods Such water displacement rod clusters are in the core typically during the first 60 of a fuel cycle, and are raised into the upper internals during the rema nder, typically 40 of the fuel cycle. Typically, the RCCVs and the gray rods in their clusters are carried by cruciform supports and are movable inside of hollow cruciform guides. These guides conventionally have slots through which coolant flows. The VERC s are not so protected. i large number of these tubes are movable in rectangula or square guides which conventionally have holes throu h which the coolant flows.During the later part of the .fuel cycle, the WDRC s are moved into and remain in perMcrate√Öa guides. All guides are part of the upper internalcof the reactor. The coolant flows vertically through the core and into the upper internal. The outlet nozzles of the vessel are disposed between he ends of the upper internals and they cause the coolant to flow horizontally. The coolant then flows gene ally transversely through the control rod assemblies i. passing to the nozzles. Typically the vertical flow of the coolant through the core has a velocity of abot 5 m sec. The flow through the nozzles has a velocity of about 15 in sec and the crossflow through some regions f the upper internals may be as high as 9 to 12 m sec. At these velocities, the coolant causes the vertical members and particularly the WDRC s, during the later part of tl fuel cycle, to vibrate. The mechanisms which cause the vibrations include vortex shedding, turbulent buffeting, fluid elastic interaction, and cavitation. It has been proposed to support the control rods in a calandria structure disposed just above the core and provided with tubes for the reception and guidance of the control rods. In the calandria the cooling water from the core is conducted outwardly to radial discharge nozzles at relatively high crossflow speeds from which the control rods are protected by the tubes. However, such a calandria is complicated since it requires installation of a large amount of closely spaced tubes, one for each control rod. The many tubes also restrict the radial flow area resulting in high flow velocities and a relatively large pressure drop. It is therefore the principal object of this invention to provide an arrangement which has all the advantages of the described calandria design without its disadvantages. With this object in view the present invention resides in a nuclear reactor including a vessel, a nuclear core supported within said vessel, control rod assemblies movably supported within said vessel and guided by vertical control rod guide means arranged in a plenum above said core, and drive rods connected to said control rod assemblies for moving said control rods into, and out of, said core, said vessel having at least one inlet nozzle for supplying a coolant to said core, the inflowing coolant after passing upwardly through said core flowing past said guide means to an outlet nozzle disposed in the side wall of said vessel, characterized in that a calandria extends across said vessel above said core sufficiently spaced therefrom that a yoke member carrying a plurality of control rods is movable in the space between said calandria and the core and that said calandria includes a plurality of hollow members, receiving said drive rods and mounted between an upper support plate and a lower support struc ture, said lower support structure being perforate for the coolant flowing axially upwardly from said core and that said calandria is radially open in communication with said outlet nozzle so that the coolant flowing into said calandria is permitted to flow transversely over the outer surfaces of said hollow members and out through said outlet nozzle without impinging on said drive rods. The invention will become more readily apparent from the following description of a preferred embodiment thereof shown, by way of example only, in the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a view in longitudinal section of a nuclear reactor in accordance with this invention Fig. 2 is a view in longitudinal section of the barrel for the upper internals and the calandria of the reactor shown in Fig. 1 Fig. 3 is a fragmental plan view of the upper internals as seen from the direction 111 111 of Fig. 1 Fig. 4 is a fragmental plan view of the lower plate of the calandria as seen from the direction IV IV ofFig. l Fig. 5 is a fragmental plan view of the upper plate of the calandria as seen from the direction V V ofFig. 1 Fig. 6 is a fragmental view in longitudinal section of the calandria and Fig. 7 shows another embodiment of the invention in a nuclear reactor. A nuclear reactor 11 includes a pressure vessel having a circularly cylindrical body 15 closed at the bottom by a spherical bowl 17. The vessel has a flanged dome shape√Öa head 19 which is bolted to the body at the flange 21. The body 15 has a plurality of inlet nozzles 23 and a plurality of outlet nozzles 25 distributed around its periphery. Typically, there are four inlet nozzles 23 interspaced in pairs between four outlet nozzles 25. In the lower region of body 15 there is a nuclear core 27. This core includes fuel assemblies 29 and thimbles 31 for receiving control rods not shown . The fuel assemblies 29 and thimbles 31 are mounted between upper core plate 33 and lower core plate 35. The control rods are mounted in clusters by means of a yoke member and include rod clusters RCC s , which have a high absorption cross section for neutrons, gray rod clusters, which have a lower absorption cross section for neutrons, and waterdisplacement rod clusters WDRC s . The RCC s serve to shut down the reactor or to reduce its thermal power output. The gray clusters serve for load follow control.The WDRC s displace the coolant in thimbles which do not receive RCC s or gray rod clusters. Such displacement takes place during the earlier part of the fuel cycle of the reactor, typically during about the first 60 of the fuel cycle. The upper part of the body 15 contains the upper internals 37 and the calandria 39. The upper internals 37 include the vertical guides 41 Fig. 3 for the RCC s and gray control rod clusters, and the vertical guides 43 for the WDRC s. The RCC1s and gray control rod clusters are mounted on cruciform structures 40 and the guides 41 for these rods are hollow cruciform cans. The guides 43 for the WDRC s are of generally rectangular or square crosssection with their corners truncated, and strictly may be described as octagonal cans. The sides 38 of the WDRC guides 43 are encompassed by projecting arms of four guides 41 and extend parallel to these arms. Plates 45 with coaxial holes 47 are vertically spaced internally along the guides 43. The plates 45 serve as supports for the can walls 38 the WDRC s extend through and are guided in the holes 47.The vertical side walls 49 and 51 of the guides 41 and 43 are substantially imperforate but the guides are open at their tops and bottoms. There may be small holes 53 and 55 in the guides 41 and 43 for the purpose of stabilizing or equalizing the pressure of the coolant. The calandria 39 Fig. 6 includes a lower generally horizontal support plate 54 Fig. 4 and an upper generally horizontal support plate 56 Fig. 5 , between which generally vertical hollow members 58 are supported. The hollow members 58 typically are tubes of circular cross section. They are secured by fillet welds 60 Fig. 6 in counterbores 62 in the upper plate 56 and pass through the lower plate 54. The hollow members 58 are slightly tapered where they join the lower plate 54.The lower plate 54 has boles 64 typically of oval shape.Each hollow member 58 is surrounded by four holes 64. The plate 54 also has pin holes 71 which serve to center the guides 41 and 43. The guides have pins not shown at the top which enter boles 71. The lower and upper plates 54 and 56 are circular and the hollow members 58 are substantially uniformly spaced in the circularly cylindrical volume defined between the plates 54 and 56. The plates are surrounded by a shell 66 Fig. 6 , which is of composite structure and includes a lower section 68 containing openings 72 which are coaxial with the openings 61 in the barrel 57 and which are spaced to mate with the openings 61. A supporting cylinder or shell 74 extends from the upper support plate 56 and includes an upper cylindrical section 76 and a flange member 78. The section 76 is welded at its lower end to the upper plate 56 and the flange member 78 is welded to the upper end of the section 76. The upper internals 37 and the calandria 39 are contained in a barrel 57 Fig. 2 The barrel 57 is circularly cylindrical and it has holes 61 below the top which are shaped to mate with the rims of contiguous outlet nozzles 25 and with the holes 72 in the shell 66 of the calandria. The barrel 57 has a flange 65 at the top at its lower end the barrel 57 supports the upper core plate 33. The guides 41 and 43 are closely packed except near the periphery. Coolant flowing from the core 27 into the spaces between the guides therefore has a high velocity and tends to flow towards the periphery. The pressure of this coolant decreases from the bottom of the upper internals 37 to the top. To suppress transverse flow of coolant under the pressure between the closely spaced guides 41 and 43 and the relatively free volume at the periphery of the upper internals 37, horizontal former plates 67 extend along the barrel 57. The core 27, upper internals 37 and calandria 39 are enclosed in an outer barrel 81. The lower core plate 35 is mounted on the lower end of this barrel 81. At its upper end the barrel 81 has a flange 85. The barrel 81 has openings located and shaped to mate with the boundaries of the openings 61 in the calandria shell 66 and coaxial with the contiguous outlet nozzles 25. The core 27, the upper internals 37, and the calandria 39 are mounted generally coaxially. The upper core plate 33 has pins 87 Figs. 1, 2 which engage and center the fuel elements 29. The cylinder 76 and the shell 60, the barrel 57 and the barrel 81 are mounted generally coaxially with each other and with the core 27, the upper internals 37 and the calandria 39. The flange 85 rests on a ledge 89 in the inner surface of body 15.The flange 65 of barrel 57 is above flange 85 and a spring not shown is interposed between these flanges. The flange 78 is disposed upon flange 65. The shell 66, the barrel 57 and the barrel 85 are oriented circumferentially so that the boundaries 91 and 93 of the openings 72 and 61 mate with each other, the boundaries 93 Fig. l of the openings 61 in barrel 57 mate with the boundaries 95 of the openings in barrel 81, and the boundaries 95 of the openings in barrel 81 mate with the inner rims 97 of the outlet nozzles 25. The annulus 99 between the barrel 81 and the body 15 provides for communication between the inlet nozzles 23 and the lower end of the core 27.The coolant which enters through the inlet nozzles 23 flows down through the annulus 99 into bowl 17, thence up through the core 27 and straight up through the upper internals 37 into the calandria 39 where it flows generally transversely to and through the outlet nozzles 25. The joints between the boundaries 91, 93 and 93, 95 and between the boundaries 95 and the rims 97 form pressure tight seals at the outlet nozzles so that there is minimal or no by pass flow of the coolant from the annulus 99 directly through the outlet nozzles 25 As shown, the outflow channels of the outlet nozzles 25 are just above the upper internals and substantially at the level of the hollow members 58 of the calandria 39 so that the coolant which passes through the calandria flows directly out of the outlet nozzles 25.The lower plate 54 of the calandria 39 is mounted contiguous to the top of the upper internals 37 and the coolant flows into the calandria through the openings in guides 41 and 43, through the spaces between these guides and through the gaps between the formers 67 and the periphery 69 of the upper internals. The calandria 39 serves as upper support for the upper internals. The drive rods 101 Fig. 5 for the control rods pass through the hollow members 58 of the calandria and are protected by these members from the coolant flowing radially outwardly o the outlet nozzles 25 at high flow velocities. The plates 54 and 56 and the hollow member 58 of the calandria are composed of stainless steel. The outlet nozzles 25, typically, are about 1 m in diame r. The hollow members 58, typically, have an outer diameter of 8.8 cm, an inner diameter of 5.5 cm and a length of about 125 cm. With the hollow members 58 of this structul e supported at both ends by the plates 54 and 56, u e stresses produced by the transverse flow of the coolan. even at a velocity of 13 in sec is minimized and failure of the hollow members is precluded. While preferred embodiments of the invention have been disclosed herein, many modifications thereof are feasible. It is, for example, possible to arrange the discharge nozzle at a lower elevation which permits reduction in vessel height and also provide for more equalized radial outflow of reactor coolant through the calandria, however, at a greater pressure drop. Such an arrangement is shown in Fig. 7 wherein functionally similar components are identified by numerals corresponding toFig. 1 As shown in this Fig. 7 , the calandria is funnel shaped in cross section with radially outwardly increasing flow cross section to cause a substantial reduction of the coolant flow speed where its flow direction is turned downwardly to the outlet nozzles 25.In both arrangements, however, the control rods and controlrod drives are protected from the outwardly directed high speed coolant flow since, within the calandria in which such radial flow takes place, the drive rods are disposed within contiguous protective tubes and in the area below the calandria there is no radial but only axial flow which does not cause rod vibration. It is also noted that the calandria when arranged above the travel area of the control rods, that is, above the rod clusters when removed from the core 27, requires only a relatively small amount of tubes 58 corresponding to the amount of control rods as compared to a calandria structure arranged directly above the core 27 which would require a tube for each control rod. As shown in Fig. 7, the outlet nozzles 25 may be paced lower than the calandria 39 so that radial coolant flow out of the calandria is first turned downwardly into annular space 160 before entering the radial outlet nozzle 25. In this arrangement, radial outflow out of the calandria is more even but the flow has to turn downwardly at the outer circumference of the calandria and then again outwardly into the outlet nozzles 25. As shown in Fig. 7, the calandria 39 may have bottom and top plates 181 and 161 so shaped that the space 163 therebetween diverges in flow direction so that the coolant flow at the outer circumference of the calandria is relatively slow so as to cause only a relatively small pressure drop at its turning point. It may also be noted from Fig. 7 that, with this arrangement, the calandria 39, which as shown, is supported on its lower support plate 181, extends into the reactor head 19 which permits the use of a reactor vessel of lower height than with the arrangement as shown in Fig. 1.
