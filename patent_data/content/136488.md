# Rocking switch actuator for a low force membrane contact switch.

## Abstract
A pivoting rocking actuator 19 has a bottom surface which comprises two spaced portions 32 , resting on the upper surface of a membrane contact switch assembly 15 when actuator 19 is at rest. One end of a buckling spring, which is initially buckled in a selected direction, acts against the upper surface of actuator 19 and the other end of the spring acts against a key. Upon key depression, the spring catastrophically buckles in the selected direction to cause initial pivoting of actuator 19 about a forward edge 47 of each of spaced portions 32 . This causes curved bottom surface 37 of actuator 19 to rotate about a pivot point to close contact switch 20 of membrane contact switch assembly 15 . When the key is released, the spring unbuck les at a slower rate than its compression so that there is an initial further rotation of actuator 19 along curved bottom surface 37 . Then, actuator 19 returns to its rest position to open contact switch 20 .
