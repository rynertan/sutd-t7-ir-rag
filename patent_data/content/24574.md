## Abstract
Apparatus for determining the refractive index profile of optical fibres. A Î» 4 plate 9 is inserted between a fibre end face 7 and an optical system 8 focussing onto that face a beam of light linearly polarized in a first plane, and collecting the light reflected by that face. The plate 9 is traversed by both the beam sent to the fibre 7 and the reflected beam, which therefore is linearly polarized in a second plane, normal to the first one. A polarizer 10 inserted between the optical system 8 and means 11, 12 converting the reflected light into elec trical signals, is arranged so as to let through only the light polarized in the second plane, thereby eliminating spurious reflections.
