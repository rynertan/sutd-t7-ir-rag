# A device at a compressed air drier.

## Abstract
A drying tower for a compressed air drier includes a base 5 and a reservoir 4 containing a cartridge 8 filled with filter material 12 and desiccant 11 . In order to obtain an optimal utilization of the desiccant and of the space the cartridge 8 completely fills the reservoir 4 and is provided with two longitudinal partition walls 13, 14 perpendicular to each other and having two openings 15 at the end remote from the base, so that aided by suitable shaping of the base the air will be transported in a winding path consecutively through all four desiccant filled compartments formed by the walls.
