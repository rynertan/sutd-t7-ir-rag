# Digital to analog converter.

## Abstract
A one bit coded signal is converted into an analog signal by means of an integrator comprising an operational ampli fier 1 , whose output 4 is fed back to the inverting input 3 by means of a first capacitor C₁ and a resistor R₁ . Depend ing on the value of the one bit coded signal a positive current pulse or a negative current pulse is applied to the inverting input 3 of the integrator. The positive current pulses are gen erated by means of a switching network 10 comprising a second capacitor C₃ which is switched by means of a plura lity of switches S₁ to S₄ . The negative current pulses are gen erated by means of a switching network 20 comprising a third capacitor C₄ which is switched by a plurality of further switches S₆ to S₈ . In order to ensure that the analog output signal is not distorted as a result of the positive and negative current pulses, a fourth capacitor C₂ is connected to the in verting input 3 of the integrator, which fourth capacitor has a higher capacitance than each of the other capacitors C₁, C₃, C₄ .
