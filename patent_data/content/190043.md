# APPARATUS FOR TRANSFERRING ELECTRICAL ENERGY TO AND FROM LIVING TISSUE

## Abstract
Apparatus for transferring electrical energy to and from living tissue comprises a glove 12 of thin, flexible elas tomeric material, which carries electrodes 14, 16 each electrically connected to a connector 20, 22 disposed at the cuff of the glove. The connector permits the electrodes to be electrically connected to a source of electrical energy or to a load, so that electrical energy may be applied to or drawn from living tissue.
