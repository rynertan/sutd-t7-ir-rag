# Soil cultivating machine.

## Abstract
A soil cultivating machine comprising soil cultivating members driven rotatably around upwardly extending axes and being carried by a gear box extending transversely of the intended direction of operative travel whereas behind the cultivating members a roller is provided that is adjustable in a direction of height on the gear box by means of supporting arms. During road transport the legal provisions in force in various combinations have to be satisfied according to which provisions the maximum width of the machine should not exceed a given number of metres, for example, 3 metres. With a machine of the kind set forth that has a construction adapted to said legal provisions the gear box can now have a length corresponding to the prescribed dimension, since at least at one end of the gear box one side of a plate extending above the gear box is fastened whilst a supporting arm for the roller is pivotally arranged on the side concerned. In this manner it can be ensured that the outer surfaces of the two plates are exactly at a relative distance corres ponding to the maximum width allowed, for example, 3 metres whilst no width is sacrificed for suspending the roller.
