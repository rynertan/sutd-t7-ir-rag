# ADDITIVE FOR IMPROVING WEATHERING RESISTANCE AND DECREASING VISCOSITY OF HIGH SOLIDS COATINGS

## Abstract
The total solids and viscosity of high solids coating compositions containing hydroxyl functional acrylic copoly mer base resins are decreased by incorporating up to about 30 by weight of a mixture of reactive diluents. The reactive diluents are a mixture of a reactive acrylic oligomer and a polycaprolactone hexol.
