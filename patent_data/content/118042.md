# Preparation of film of web reinforced photopolymerized hydrophilic interpolymer.

## Abstract
A process is taught in which a flexible, reinforcing traveling web 40 may be uniformly, thinly transfer coated, on both sides of the web simultaneously, with a low viscosity liquid or mixture of monomers which may or may not wet the web, but does not wet the surface of a substrate 5 on which the web and mixture are deposited. The liquid or mixture is first curtain coated on an applicator curtain 30 , against which the web moves in controlled contact. An apparatus is provided for transfer coating a travelling web with a low viscosity liquid which is first curtain coated on an applicator curtain.
