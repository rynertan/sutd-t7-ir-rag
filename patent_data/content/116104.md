## Description
This invention relates to methods and arrangements for testing mineral soils and soiless compost to determine the nutrient content thereof. Numerous mineral soils and soiless composts do not have the ability to retain minerals and nutrients, and it is thus important to have the ability to regularly test and check such mineral soils and soiless compounds for nutrients and nutrient levels. This then enables mineral and nutrient feeding to maintain adequate and desired levels. It is also of course important to be able to monitor nutrient status of various mediums in order to ensure that plants can grow under optimum conditions, whether they be cropping plants such as for example tomatoes, or shrubs. Up until this time, various means for the analysis of substrates have been put forward and provided, but these have all entailed to a large extent, analysis in laboratories or laboratory conditions, which has involved delays in having tests carried out and has also involved reasonably substantial expense. In particular, in the case of horticulturalists involved for example in growing plants or shrubs, it becomes very time consuming and expensive to have to deliver samples of substrate to laboratories and then go and pick them up at a later date following analysis. Such analyses can often take two or three days, and can be expensive, and in addition, do not provide instant or immediate analysis.As will be appreciated if analysis in a laboratory situation takes something like two or three days, by the time the analysis is returned, the state of the substrate initially analysed will have changed. The present invention sets out to provide a method and arrangement whereby mineral soils and soiless composts hereinafter referred to as substrate can be analysed substantially insitu, or on site.The invention provides a kit for the analysis of substrate to determine nutrient presence and also provides for a method of carrying out such testing. By using the present invention users are able to carry out testing themselves and are able to obtain results at the time of carrying out the tests, thus overcoming the problems encountered with analysis and testing up until this time. It will also be appreciated that by permitting users to carry out testing themselves, more regular and frequest testing and analysis can take place, thus keeping a more regular or frequent monitor on the nutrient state of the substrate. The present invention has application to the analysis or testing of substrates such as soiless growing media such as compost, peat, bark, pumice and sawdust mixes. It also has application to nutrient solutions of a nutrient film technique and has application also to mineral soils. The present invention provides relative accuracy in testing, and provides apparatus within the arrangement and method of the invention to permit straight forward and efficient testing and analysis to take place.

The term filtrate is hereinafter defined as that matter extracted from a mixture of substrate and extractant and which has been filtered by a filter so as to be separated from a main mixture of substrate and solvent. The term shaker container 1 is hereinafter defined as a container used for shaking and agitating matter and is for example used to mix together by shaking and agitation, substrate and extractant. The term primary container is hereinafter defined as a container in which a mixture of substrate and extractant is placed after shaking or agitating in which a filter is preferably located for the separation of a filtrate as hereinbefore defined from the mixture of substrate and extractant. The term nitrate test paper is hereinafter defined as testing paper preferably in strips, and divided into sections for use in testing nitrogen or nitrate concentrations, which are indicated by the reaction of the strip paper, such as by colours being activated. The term nitrogen standard is hereinafter defined as predetermined amounts of nitrogen or matter containing predetermined amounts of nitrogen for use in comparison with amounts of nitrogen in samples tested in sample containers as herein defined . The term phosphorus re agent stock solution is hereinafter defined as a mixture of ammonium molybdate, antimony potassium tartartate and sulphuric acid. The term phosphorus re agent tablet where used is hereinafter defined as an ascorbic acid tablet or tablet including ascorbic acid. The term phosphorus re agent is hereinafter defined as a combination of re agent stock solution, as herein defined and ascorbic acid or phosphorus re agent tablet as herein defined , The term phosphorus standard is hereinafter definec as matter being or including predetermined amounts of phone phorus to establish standards of phosphorus content again which tests or comparisons can be made. The term potassium standard is hereinafter defined matter being or including predermined amounts of potassium for use in testing or comparison to determine potassium levels in samples. The invention has particular application to the analysis or testing of substrate to determine nutrient levels and in particular nitrate, ammoniacal nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium levels. Referring firstly to Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings, a sample of substrate is taken. In the case of mineral soils, 5 grams of mineral soil is taken and is compacted into a container such as for example a secondary container shown in Figure 1B of the accompanying drawings. Following compacting of the soil, the soil is passed by way for example of a funnel, into a shaker container. An extractant such as water, and or sodium bicarbonate preferably in the amount of about 100 mls is then added together with a small portion of an appropriate decolourising powder. The shaker container is then sealed and is agitated by hand for a period of about 2 minutes. The shaking by hand enables the agitating and mixing and the extraction of nutrients from the soil into the extractant, to take place in a straight forward and efficient manner. If desired, one container can be held in each hand of the user. Once the shaking or extraction period has expired, the mixture of substrate, extractant and decolourising powder is poured into a primary container. tThere nutrients are being extracted from soiless compost, in one form of the invention 80m1s is compacted into a secondary container and this is then passed by way of a funnel into a shaker container. About 120 mls of water is then added together with a portion of decolourising powder. The shaker container is then closed and the container if desired one in each hand agitated or shaken for about 2 minutes. This then results in the nutrients being extracted from the soiless compost or substrate and the shaker container is opened and the matter poured into a primary container. The addition of the colourising powder is to avoid any colour from the substrate affecting the filtrate to be tested as will be described hereinafter especially when some of the testing depends upon comparison between colours and comparison between cloudiness. up until this time, numerous means of agitation and shaking have been used, all involving laboratory techniques and machinery which is expensive and time consuming. In particular, up until this time it has been found that it is necessary to agitate to shake the mixture of substrate and extractant for a period of something like 15 minutes. In the present invention however, it has been found that this is not necessary, and that more than adequate nutrients can be obtained for the purposes of testing, by shaking or agitating the containers by hand, for a period of about 2 minutes. This then is a substantial advance, in that it provides for a straight forward and efficient manner of extraction and avoids the time and expense taken with mechanical and prolonged agitation and extraction. By way of example, extraction was carried out by hand agitation and shaking, and compared with extraction after laboratory mixing such as laboratory auto analyser.Three samples were tested for nitrate, phosphorus and potassium. The results are set out here below COMPARISON OF TEST KIT RESULTS WITH LAB.AUTOANALYSER NITRATE PHOSPHORUS POTASSIUM Test Auto Test Auto Test Auto Kit Analyser Kit Analyser Kit Analyser SAMPLEl 40ppm 39.2ppm lppm 1.3pom 15ppm 29ppm SAMPLE 2 100ppm 105ppm 4ppm 5.lppm 60ppm 62ppmSAMPLE 3 114ppm 167pcm 24ppm 25ppm 120ppm 139ppm Once the mixture of substrate and extractant has been placed into the primary container, a filter is located within the container. The filter is located within the container so that the filter isolates an area of filtrate within the container and separates it from the remaining mixture of substrate and solvent. This is shown by way of example in Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings. Preferably, as shown in Figure 13 of the accompanying drawings, the filter is capable of being formed or folded into a substantially tapered, conical or pyramid type form, so that it extends into the container and isolates an area of filtrate within the primary container which is while being in the primary container, separated from the remainder of the substrate and extractant. Thus for testing purposes, either test paper or droppers or the like can be inserted into the area of clear separated filtrates, which can be used for testing purposes. The filter is preferably a paper filter which is substantially circular in plan, but which is provided with pleats or folds of a radial nature extending inwardly to a substantial centre point, such that the filter is able to be formed into a substantially conical form for location within the container. The paper or filtering nature of the filter is such that the equilibrium of the filtrate within the area defined by the filter, within the primary container will be maintained for use in testing. It has been found that this has been a substantial advantage, in that up until this time and especially in laboratory situations, it has been necessary for funnels and separate filters to be provided, whereby after mixing or extraction, the matter has passed through funnels and filters and has been fed into a container from where the filtrate on its own is contained and used for testing purposes. By inserting a filter such as that described, into a mixture of substrate and extractant nutrients having been extracted from the substrate , time and expense are saved in that once the mixture is poured from the shaker container into the primary container, all that is required is for the filter to be folded and neatly inserted into the container whereupon it immediately forms and defines a separated area of filtrate for use in testing. Thus, this is an advance in so far as time and expense are concerned and it also provides for straight forward operating and effectiveness, especially when incorporated into an arrangement such as the present invention for regular and efficient testing for nutrient levels. The containers and funnels where used can be of a glass or plastic material as may be desired. If desired, more than one sample can be tested at a time. The invention will however be described by way of example only, with reference to one sample being tested at a time or one primary cbntainer with sample filtrate therein being tested at a time. The present invention provides for the arrangement to be in a test kit formation, contained in a suitable packing or housing, which can be carried from place to place. The packing or housing is in the form of a case and is provided with the necessary containers, chemicals, testing chemicals, dropp,ers, syringes, containers and the like. Indeed, it can be said that all matter requi red for the testing of substrate for nutrients, in accordance with the invention, are contained within an overall container for carrying from place to place. Thus, the invention firstly provides means for the testing of substrate to determine nitrogen or nitrate levels. Refererence is made by way of example to Figure 2 of the accompanying drawings. Firstly, the invention provides for a plurality of nitrogen standards, which are bottles or containers, having varying degrees of nitrogen or matter containing various degrees of nitrogen therein. These are used for the purpose of comparison with the results from samples. In one form of the invention the nitrate nitrogen standards are calibrated as NO3 N 2, 7, 23, 57, 114 parts per million . Thus, preferably there are five nitrogen standards but if desired, this number can vary. t is however most desirable to have a plurality of nitrogen standards to five variation and a range for comparison purposes. Thus, the five nitrogen or nitrate standards hereinafter referred to as 1,nitrate standards are open or uncapped and are preferably placed in a stand for the containers. Nitrate test strips are then taken and one is dipped into the filtrate defined by the filter within the primary container. The strip is preferably dipped into the solution or filtrate within the filter to wet the squares.It is then shaken to remove excess liquid. Test strips are then inserted into the nitrate standard containers and after the predetermined or required period of time the sample strips can be compared to determine nitrate levels in the sample being the filtrate. If desired additional colouring charts or coloured measures can be provided for assistance.t Suitable directions can be provided in association with the invention so that it is clear exactly what des irable nitrate standards are. We refer now to Figure 3 of these drawings, which relates to the testing for phosphorus nutrients. The basic sample material used for testing is the filtrate from the primary container and the filtrate is removed by a dropper from within the area bounded or defined by the filter within the primary container. A plurality preferably five sample containers are provided and these are preferably elongate tubes or vials. These are preferably set up in a stand and the dropper is used to apply ml of filtrate into each sample container. Water can then be added to each sample container so that there is up to 10 mls in each sample container. The invention also provides for a phosphorus reagent which is formed by the combination of phosphorus re agent stock and phosphorus re agent tablets and ascorbic acid. The phosphorus re agent stock is made up of a mixture of ammonium molybdate, antimony potassium tartartate and sulphuric acid. To form the phosphorus re agent, which is capable of reacting with phosphorus standards hereinafter to be described and samples within the containers, to bring about a clear indication as to phosphorus levels, it is necessary to pro vide the phosphorus re agent stock and ascorbic acid separately in that when combined, they do not store. Thus, a container containing the phosphorus reagent stock is mixed with the ascorbic acid. This mixture takes place in a secondary container. The ascorbic acid is preferably in a tablet form or in the form of a portion of a tablet and it is particularly advantageous to use a concentrated vitamin C tablet including ascorbic acid, as this results in quick and speedy dissolving. For example, it is found that it is particularly advantageous to use vitamin C REDOXIN registered trade mark tablets. Thus, preferably 25 ml of the phosphorus reagent stock is mixed in a plastic beaker or secondary container with the ascorbic acid or tablet being a phosphorus re agent tablet. This mixture could keep for twelve tests, but will not keep longer than one day. Phosphorus standards are provided, being containers including phosphorus or matter containing predetermined amounts of phosphrosu which all have phosphorus of predetermined levels, The levels of phosphorus in phosphorus standards are P 2, 5, 10, 25, 40 parts per million . Standard containers are then taken and set up in an appropriate stand, there preferably being five such standard containers. A syringe or dropper is then taken and e ml of each phosphorus standard is inserted into a separate standard container. A further dropper or syringe or the original one is washed or cleaned is then used and 2 ml of phos phprus re agent as hereinbefore described is inserted into each of the standard containers and each of the sample containers. Water is then added to each of the standard containers and each of the sample containers to bring the contents of each up to about 10ml. The containers are then left for a predetermined period of time which is preferably about 10 minutes and after the expiration of that period of time a comparison is made between the colour of each test sample and the colour of the standard containers. These should give an indication as to the nutrient content in the sample containers. It has been found that it is often difficult to determine the exact colour or degree of difference, and thus if the colour is faint, it has been found to be advantageous to look down the tubes from above, if necessary holding the tubes or containers over a white or light surface to give increased accuracy. If in use, it is found that the colour of a sample is darker than the highest standard and is the standard container including a sample from the phosphorus standard having 40 ppm , the test should be repeated, this time using only ml of the sample and using 1 ml syringe. The result should however be mult iplied by two. We refer now to Figure 4 of the drawings which relates to testing for the presence of potassium nutrients. The samples are taken from the filtrate in the primary container the filtrate being bounded by the filter as hereinbefore described and as shown by way of example in the accompanying drawings. A single sample container can be taken and if desired placed in a suitable stand or support. Preferably by way of a dropper, b ml of the filtrate is taken and placed into the sample container. A plurality of potassium standards are provided which are also preferably mounted in a stand or mounting, there preferably being five potassium standards in appropriate bottles or containers. By way of example the potassium standards are calibrated as follows K 20, 40, 60, 80, 120 parts per million . In addition, a plurality of standard containers preferably five in. number . are provided and are mounted in a suitable stand or mounting. The invention provides for the provision of containers including three potassium re agents, which we refer to as first potassium re agent, second potassium re agent and third potassium re agent. The first potassium re agent is preferably sodium hydroxide. The second potassium re agent is preferably formaldehyde solution and the third potassium re agent is preferably sodium tetraphenyl boron. These are provided in suitable re agent containers. A 1 ml dropper is preferably taken and a ml of the filtrate is placed into the sample container which is preferably a small vial or container. Using the same 1 ml dropper, e ml of each potassium standard is then taken and placed into respective standard containers. Following this, and using again the lml dropper, one drop of first potassium re agent is added to each container, being each of the sample containersand each of the Standard containers. Following this, and again using the 1 ml dropper, one drop of the second potassium re agent is placed into the sample container and each of the standard containers. The sample container and each of the standard containers are then shaken to mix. Following this, a syringe or dropper of an appropriate form is taken and 3.5 ml of the third potassium re agent is added to each of the sample container and standard containers. If desired, pouring out into a beaker may be easier, Each container is then closed or stopped and is mixed up being shaken by hand. A period of time is then left, and after two minutes, but certainly no longer than ten minutes the cloudiness of the sample, being the matter within the sample container, is compared with the contents of the standard containers. The cloudiness of the matter should be compared. If difficulty is encountered, it has been found that by shining a light up through the mixture, from the bottom of each container, a clearer indication as to the nature of the cloudiness can be obtained and thus a more accurate comparison formed. It has been found that by using a red light, there are substantial advantages and the degree of cloudiness is further able to be compared. If the sample is cloudier than the highest standard, being 120 parts per million, the test should be repeated again, taking i ml of the sample and using 1 ml syringe and adding h ml of water. The result should be multiplied by two. We refer now to Figure 5 of the accompanying drawings, which relates to testing for the presence of ammos ium nutrients. As in other tests, the primary container is used and houses the filter and mixture of substrate and solvent, the filter defining an area of clean and clear filtrate within the container. At least one sample container is taken and preferably placed in a suitable holder or rack. A dropper or applicator is taken and ml of the filtrate is placed into the sample container. Preferably, the dropper used is a 1 ml dropper. The nitrogen standards as hereinbefore referred to are used and a plurality, being preferably five, standard containers are inserted into suitable stands so that they can be used. Using a dropper, e ml of each nitrogen standard is inserted into respective standard containers. The sample container and standard containers are then topped.up with a solvent such as water, for example until each container has approximately 10 mls of matter within it. Referring to the ammonium standards, these are in this form of the invention calibrated so that the amounts of ammonium therewithin, are as follows NH4 N 25, 50, 100, 150, 200 parts per million . Ammonium re agent is provided and is in the form of a mixture of red mercuric iodide, potassium iodide and sodium hydroxide. Preferably, the red mercuric iodide and potassium iodide are dissolved in water, the sodium hydroxide also being dissolved in water. The two solutions are then cooled and mixed. The ammonium re agent hereinbefore referred to is inserted into the sample container and into each of the standard containers. Preferably, an amount of 2 ml is inserted by way of an appropriate dropper, into the sample container and each standard container. The sample container and standard containers are then inverted a few times or shaken, so as to be mixed. The sample container and standard containers are then left for a predetermined period of time for example 5 minutes and after five minutes the colours of the standard containers can be compared with the colour in the sample container to indicate ammonium nutrient levels in the sample. It will be appreciated that the above are tests to be carried out by equipment provided in a container or kit, and that the invention provides for such tests to be carried out insitu or on site, and avoids as far as possible the lengthy and expensive laboratory testing procedures required up until this time.
