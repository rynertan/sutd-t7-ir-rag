# Vibration sensor and the method of and apparatus for manufacture thereof.

## Abstract
An improved method and apparatus are provided for making vibration sensors, particularly of the type used in automotive applications wherein a piezoelectric element is affixed to a flexing plate which is mounted on a support stem in umbrella fashion. A desired resonant vibrating fre quency of the sensor is obtained by progressively working a neck portion of the support stem, as by peening, to effectively decrease the vibrating radius of the plate and thus increase its resonant frequency toward and to a desired resonant fre quency. The plate s frequency is monitored and the working of the stem neck portion is terminated when a desired res onant frequency is attained. An inclined support shoulder on the stem below the neck portion facilitates the aforemen tioned manufacture. An undercut positioned in the stem neck portion near its transition into the support shoulder further facilitates the manufacture.
