# Uniaxially drawn oriented polyolefin film for electric insulation and manufacturing method for the same.

## Abstract
A uniaxially drawn oriented polyolefin film for cable insulation, has a thickness of 80 to 250 µ and is com posed of a crystalline polyolefin having a melt index of 10 or more and 0.5 to 20 phr of unsintered polytetra fluoroethylene, wherein the added unsintered polytetra fluoroethylene is in the form of microfibrous particles uniformly dispersed in the crystalline polyolefin as a matrix so as to be parallel to the orientation axis of the polyolefin an apparent MI value of the film is 1 4 to 1 10 of the MI value of the crystalline polyolefin used the tensile Young s modulus of the film in the direction of the orientation axis is 2 10⁴ kg cm² or more and the change in the thickness of the film in dodecylbenzene at 100 C is 10 or less. A method for manufacturing this film is also provided.
