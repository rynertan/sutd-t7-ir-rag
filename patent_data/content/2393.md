# Operating unit for selector switch.

## Abstract
The invention relates to an operating unit for electric selector switches. The operating unit comprises a tubular housing provided with stop means and an actuating assembly 39, 41, 45 supported in the housing so as to be rotatable therein, preferably in steps, the actuating assembly including an actuator 41 , and a handle 39 which is removably mounted on the actuator and provided with stop means 63, 65, 67, 69 cooperating with the stop means of the housing to determine the maximum extent of rotatability of the actuating assembly, both the handle and the actuator being provided with interfitting means 59, 61 and 93 97 enabling the handle to be selectively mounted on the actuator in different angular positions with respect thereto, and thereby enabling said maximum extent of rotatability to be varied. This arrangement allows a selector switch to be readily changed from a two position switch to a more than two position switch, and vice versa, simply be repositioning the handle on the actuator. Preferably, the actuating assembly is supported in the housing also for limited axial movement therein, and it includes a contact actuating cam 45 which is connected to the actuator 41 for rotation in unison therewith yet such as to permit axial movement of the cam relative to the actuator. This feature enables the selector switch with which the operating unit is employed to be used as a pushbutton as well as rotary switch.
