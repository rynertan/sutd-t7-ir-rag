# MICROPROCESSOR BASED CONTROL AND DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM FOR MOTOR OPERATED VALVES

## Abstract
A valve stem position sensor 46 measures the stem position and a load sensor 48 measures the load on the valve stem 40 of a valve 25 operated by a motor 24 coupled to the stem 40 through a worm shaft 42 and gears 44 . A programmed microprocessor 32 periodically tests the status of the valve 25 , and turns off the motor 24 if valve stem position and valve stem load criteria are not satisfied. The testing includes comparing the valve stem position with a preselected open position during opening and comparing the valve stem load with a preselected maximum desirable stem opening load during opening, and with a preselected maximum desirable stem closing load during closing. During opening, the position of the valve stem at a predefined time in the future is predicted and the motor 24 turned off it is beyond a preselected position. During closing, the load on the valve stem at a predefined time in the future is predicted and the motor 24 turned off if it exceeds a preselected maximum load. Motor overload protection is provided by periodically measuring 70 the actual load on the motor 24 comparing the motor load with a preselected maximum value during opening and closing of the valve 25 and turning off the motor 24 if the measured motor load does not meet predefined criteria.
