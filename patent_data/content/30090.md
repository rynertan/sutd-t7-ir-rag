# Detergent composition and method for producing it.

## Abstract
A particulate detergent composition for fabric conditioning includes, in addition to a detergency active material, from 10 40 of a mixture of tripolyphosphate and orthophosphate in the ratio of 20 1 to 3 1 together with 2 25 of a mixture of soap and an anionic polyelectrolyte in the ratio of 10 1 to 1 1. Any pyrophosphate present must be kept below 5 . The soap and polyelectrolyte result in reduced deposition of inorganic materials onto the fabrics. The preferred polyelectrolyte is sodium polyacrylate with a molecular weight of about 27,000. The composition may also include conventional additional ingredients.
