# An automatic transmission and a method for controlling the same.

## Abstract
The invention relates to an automatic transmission and a method for controlling the same. On an input and an output shafts 6, 7 of the trans mission, there are provided a plurality of gear pairs 61, 71, ... which have different reduction ratios. One of the gears 65 of the gear pair 65, 75 having the smallest reduction ratio is operably connected with the input shaft 6 through a multi disk clutch 19 and the torque transmitted from the input shaft 6 to the gear can be controlled by adjusting the thrusting force applied to the clutch 19 . When the selection of the gear pair is changed, the gear pair under operation at present is brought into the neutral condition and at the same time, the thrusting force of the clutch 19 is increased. Thereby, the torque of the input shaft 6 is transmitted to the output shaft 7 through the clutch 19 and a rotational synchronism of the input and output shafts is advanced by adjusting the thrusting force. When the rota tional synchronism is completed, the gear pair to be select ed is brought under the operation.
