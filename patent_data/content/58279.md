# NON VOLATILE SEMICONDUCTOR MEMORY CIRCUITS

## Abstract
A non volatile semiconductor memory circuit having at least one variable threshold FATMOS transistor Q3, Q4 in the cross coupled lateral branches and a plurality of input switching transistors controlling operation of the circuit. Capacitive imbalance between the nodes X1, X2 of the circuit between a node X1 and an input switching transistor Q14 driven by the same control signal as a corresponding transistor Q13 connected between the other node X2 and an input switching transistor Q15 . This reduces the occurr ence of wrong state switching in the circuit during reading.
