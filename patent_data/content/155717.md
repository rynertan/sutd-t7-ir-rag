# Push pull amplifier.

## Abstract
In order to obtain class AB operation of a push pull amplifier which comprises a preamplifier 10 and an output amplifier 20 comprising complementary output transistors T₁, T₂ , the base emitter voltage of the first output transistor T₁ is converted into a current by a voltage to current converter R₁, T₃ and this current is re converted into this base emitter voltage by a current to voltage converter R₂, T₄ and added to the base emitter voltage of the second output transistor T₂ . By means of a differential amplifier comprising third and fourth transistors T₅, T₆ whose collectors are loaded by current sources I₂, I₃ and are connected to the bases of the first and the second output transistor T₁, T₂ , the sum of said base emitter voltages is maintained equal to a reference voltage generated across two diode connected transistors T₇, T₈ .
