# Apparatus for transmitting energy to and from coils.

## Abstract
An apparatus for transmitting energy to and from coils 31, 41 is characterized by the use of on off self controllable switches such as gate turn off thyristors 51, 52 or the like, controlled such that a large common unipolar energy transfer ring capacitor 1 has a constant voltage. This allows use of a cheaper capacitor and improves en ergy transmitting speed.
