## Description
MOLECULAR SIEVE COMPOSITIONSField of the Invention The instant invention relates to a novel class of crystalline microporous molecular sieves, to the method of their preparation and to their use as adsorbents and catalyst. The invention relates to novel molecular sieves which contain framework tetrahedral oxide units of aluminum phosphorus iron and or titanium and at least one of cobalt, magnesium, manganese and zinc. These compositions may be prepared hydrothermally from gels containing reactive compounds of the aforementioned elements capable of forming framework tetrahedral oxides, and preferably preferably at least one organic templating agent which functions in part to determine the course of the crystallization mechanism and the structure of the crystalline product.Background of the Invention Molecular sieves of the crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite type are well known in the art and now comprise over 150 species of both naturally occurring and synthetic compositions. In general the crystalline zeolites are formed from corner sharing Alto2 and SiO2 tetrahedra and are characterized by having pore openings of uniform dimensions, having a significant ion exchange capacity and being capable of reversibly desorbing an adsorbed phase which is dispersed throughout the internal voids of the crystal without displacing any atoms which make up the permanent crystal structure. Other crystalline microporous compositions which are not zeolitic, i.e. do not contain Alto2 tetrahedra as essential framework constituents, but which exhibit the ion exchange and or adsorption characteristics of the zeolites are also known.Petal organosilicates which are said to possess ion exchange properties, have uniform pores and are capable of reversibly adsorbing molecules having molecular diameters of about 6A or less, are reported in U.S. Patent No. 3.941,871 issued March 2, 1976 to Dwyer et al. A pure silica polymorph, silicalite, having molecular sieving properties and a neutral framework containing neither cations nor cation sites is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4.061,724 issued December 6, 1977 to R.W. Grose et al. A recently reported class of microporous compositions and the first framework oxide molecular sieves synthesized without silica, are the crystalline aluminophosphate compositions disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,310,440 issued January 12, 1982 to Wilson et al. These materials are formed fromA102 and P02 tetrahedra and have electrovalently neutral frameworks as in the case of silica polymorphs. Unlike the silica molecular sieve, silicalite, which is hydrophobic due to the absence of extra structural cations the aluminophosphate molecular sieves are moderately hydrophilic, apparently due to the difference in electronegativity between aluminum and phosphorus.Their intracrystalline pore volumes and pore diameters are comparable to those known for zeolites and silica molecular sieves. In copending and commonly assigned application Serial No. 400,438, filed July 26, 1982, there is described a novel class of silicon substituted aluminophosphates which are both microporous and crystalline. The materials have a three dimensional crystal framework of PO , A1O2 and SiO2 tetrahedral units and, exclusive of any alkali metal or calcium which may optionally be present, an as synthesized empirical chemical composition on an anhydrous basis of mR SixAlyPz O2 wherein R represents at least one organic templating agent present in the intracrystalline pore system m represents the moles of Rn present per mole of SiXAlyPz 02 and has a value of from zero to 0.3, the maximum value in each case depending upon the molecular dimensions of the templating agent and the available void volume of the pore system of the particular silicoaluminophosphate species involved and x , y , and z represent the mole fractions of silicon, aluminum and phosphorus, respectively.present as tetrahedral oxides. The minimum value for each of x , llylle and z is 0.01 and preferably 0.02. The maximum value for x is 0.98 for y is 0.60 and for z l is 0.52. These silicoaluminophosphates exhibit several physical and chemical properties which are characteristic of aluminosilicate zeolites and aluminophosphates. In copending and commonly assigned application Serial No. 480,738. filed March 31, 1983 there is described a novel class of titanium containing molecular sieves denominated therein as TAPO or ZTAPOs whose chemical composition in the as synthesized and anhydrous form is represented by the unit empirical formula mR TixAlyPz O2 wherein wRX represents at least one organic templating agent present in the intracrystalline pore system, mZ represents the moles of R present per mole of Ti xAl P 02 and has a value of between zero and about 5.0 and x , ty and z represent the mole fractions of titanium, aluminum and phosphorus, respectively, present as tetrahedral oxides. In copending and commonly assigned application Serial No. 514,334, filed July 15, 1983, there is described a novel class of crystalline metal aluminophosphates denominated therein as eAPON or IMeAPOsH having three dimensional microporous framework structures of MO A10 2 2 and PO2 tetrahedral units and having an empirical chemical composition on an anhydrous basis expressed by the formula mR MxAlyPz O2 wherein R represents at least one organic templating agent present in the intracrystalline pore system 1 represents the moles of UR present per mole of MxAlyPz O2 and has a value of from zero to 0.3 M represents at least one metal of the group magnesium, manganese, zinc and cobalt x , y and z represent the mole fraction of the metal aluminum and phosphorus, respectively, present as tetrahedral oxides. In copending and commonly assigned application Serial No. 514,335, filed July 15, 1983, there is described a novel class of crystalline ferroaluminophosphates denominated therein as CAPO or FAPOs having a three dimensional microporous framework structure of FeO2. AlO2 and PO2 tetrahedral units and having an empirical chemical composition on a anhydrous basis expressed by the formula mR FeyAlyPz Q2 wherein R represents at least one organic templating agent present in the intracrystalline pore system Um represents the moles of R present per mole of FeAlyP 02 and has a value of from zero to 0.3 and x , y and z represent the mole fraction of the iron, aluminum and phosphorous, respectively, present as tetrahedral oxides. The instant invention relates to new molecular sieve compositions which comprise framework tetrahedral units of MO2, A1O2 and PC2 where M represents iron and or titanium, and at least one of cobalt, magnesium, manganese and zinc, and where Mnli is 0, 1 or 2.DescriPtion of the Fiqures FIG. 1 is a ternary diagram wherein parameters relating to the instant compositions ae set forth as mole fractions. FIG. 2 is a ternary diagram wherein parameters relating to preferred compositions are set forth as mole fractions. FIG. 3 is a ternary diagram wherein parameters relating to the reaction mixtures employed in the preparation of the compositions of this invention are set forth as mole fractions.Summary of the Invention The instant invention relates to a new class of molecular sieves having a crystal framework structure of MOn2, A1o2 and PO2 tetrahedral oxide units wherein M represents iron and or titanium, and at least one of cobalt, magnesium, manganese and zinc, and where n is 0, 1 or 2. These new molecular sieves exhibit ion exchange, adsorption and catalytic properties and, accordingly, find wide use as adsorbents and catalysts.The members of this novel class of compositions have crystal framework structures of and have an empirical chemical composition on an anhydrous basis expressed by the formula BR XxAl yPz C2 wherein ZRK represents at least one organic templating agent present in the intracrystalline pore system M represents at least one element from each of the two classes of 1 iron and titanium and 2 cobalt, magnesium, manganese and zinc KmK represents the molar amount of wR present per mole of MXAlyPz O2 and has a value of zero to about 0.3 and Mx , y and we represent the mole fractions of M , aluminum and phosphorus, respectively, present as tetrahedral oxides.These molecular sieve compositions comprise crystalline molecular sieves having a three dimensional microporous framework structure of NOn2, A102 and PO2 tetrahedral units, wherein MOnê represents tetrahedral units of iron and or titanium, and at least one of cobalt, magnesium. manganese and zinc. The molecular sieves of the instant invention will be generally referred to by the acronym tAPO to designate molecular sieves having a three dimensional microporous framework of Mown. A1O2 and PO tetrahedral oxide 2 2 units as described herein. Actual class members will be identified by denominating the various structural species which make up the XAPO class by assigning a number and by replacing X by the elements present as tetrahedral oxides with aluminum and phosphorus and, accordingly, e.g., are identified as XAPO i wherein lijis is an integer.This designation is an arbitrary one and is not intended to denote structural relationship to another material s which may also be characterized by a numbering system.Detailed Description of the Invention The instant invention relates to a new class of molecular sieves comprising crystal framework structures of , A1 2 andPO 2 tetrahedral units where n is 0, 1 or 2 and where M represents at least one element from each of the two classes of 1 iron and titanium and 2 cobalt, magnesium, manganese and zinc. These new molecular sieves exhibit ion exchange.adsorption and catalytic properties ana, accordingly, find wide use as adsorbents and catalysts. The members of this novel class of compositions have a crystal framework structure ofMOn2, AlO2 and PO 2 tetrahedral oxide 2 2 units and have an empirical chemical composition on an anhydrous basis expressed by the formula IR NxAl P C2 wherein RZ represents at least one organic templating agent present in the intracrystalline pore system we represents at least two elements from the two classes of 1 iron and titanium and 2 cobalt. magnesium, manganese and zinc m represents the molar amount of SeRS present per mole of MxAlyPz O2 and has a value of zero to about 0.3 Zx , ZyZ and z represent the mole fractions of M . aluminum and phosphorus, respectively, present as tetrahedral oxides. The mole fractions x , y , and z are generally defined as being within the pentagonal compositional area defined by points A. B. C. D, and E of the ternary diagram of FIG.1. Points A. B, C.D, and E of FIG. 1 have the following values for x . y , and Sz Mole FractionPoint x V zA 0.02 0.60 0.38B 0.02 0.38 0.60C 0.39 0.01 0.60D 0.98 0.01 0.01E 0.39 0.60 0.01 In a preferred subclass of the molecular sieves the values of x , y and z in the above formula are within the hexagonal compositional area defined by the points a, b, c, d. e, and f of the ternary diagram which is FIG. 2 of the drawings, said points a, b, c, d, e, and f representing the following values for x , y and z Mole FractionPoint x y z a 0.02 0.60 0.38 b 0.02 0.38 0.60 c 0.39 0.01 0.60 d 0.60 0.01 0.39 e 0.60 0.39 0.01 f 0.39 0.60 0.01 The XAPO molecular sieves of this invention are useful as adsorbents, catalysts, ion exchangers, and the like in much the same fashion as aluminosilicates have been employed heretofore, although their chemical and physical properties are not necessarily similar to those observed for aluminosilicates. XAPO compositions are generally synthesized by hydrothermal crystallization from a reaction mixture containing reactive sources of M , aluminum and phosphorus. preferably an organic templating, i.e., structure directing, agent, preferably a compound of an element of Group VA of the PeriodicTable. and or optionally an alkali metal. The reaction mixture is generally placed in a sealed pressure vessel, preferably lined with an inert plastic material such as polytetrafluoroethylene and heated, preferably under autogenous pressure at a temperature between 500C and 2500C, and preferably between 100 C and 200 C until crystals of the XAPO product are obtained, usually a period of from hours to several weeks. Typical crystallization times are from about 2 hours to about 30 days with from about 2 hours to about 20 days typically being employed.The product is recovered by any convenient method such as centrifugation or filtration. In synthesizing the compositions of the instant invention. it is preferred to employ a reaction mixture composition expressed in terms of the molar ratios as follows aR MXAlyPz O2 bH2O wherein RZ is an organic templating agent a is the amount of organic templating agent ZRte and has a value of from zero to about 6 and is preferably an effective amount within the range of greater than zero 0 to about 6 M represents at least one element from each of the two classes of 1 iron and titanium and 2 cobalt. magnesium, manganese and zinc b has a value of from zero 0 to about 500. preferably between 2 and about 300 and x . y and z represent the mole fractions of M iron and or titanium. and at least one of cobalt.magnesium, manganese and zinc , aluminum and phosphorus, respectively, in the E Al P 02 x yz constituent, and each has a value of at least 0.01 with the proviso that x has a value of at least 0.02 and x , Sense and z are preferably within the pentagonal compositional area defined by points F,G, H, I and J which is shown in FIG. 3 of the drawings, the points F, G, H, I and J representing the following values for x , y and z Mole FractionPoint x Y z F 0.02 0.60 0.38 G 0.02 0.38 0.60 H 0.39 0.01 0.60 I 0.98 0.01 0.01 J 0.39 0.60 0.01 In the aforementioned expression of the reaction composition, the reactants are normalized with respect to a total of x y z 1.00 mole, whereas in some examples the reaction mixtures may be expressed in terms of molar oxide ratios and may be normalized to 1.00 mole of P2O5. This latter form is readily converted to the former by routine calculations by dividing the total number of moles of , aluminum and phosphorus into the moles of each of M , aluminum and phosphorus. The moles of template and water may be similarly normalized by dividing by the total moles of M , aluminum and phosphorus. In forming the reaction mixture from which the instant molecular sieves are formed the organic templatirg agent can be any of those heretofore proposed for use in the synthesis of conventional zeolite aluminosilicates. In general these compounds contain elements of Group VA of thePeriodic Table of Elements, particularly nitrogen, phosphorus. arsenic and antimony, preferably nitrogen or phosphorus and most preferably nitrogen, which compounds also contain at least one alkyl or aryl group having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms. Particularly preferred compounds for use as templating agents are the gamines, quaternary phosphonium compounds and quaternary ammonium compounds, the latter two being represented generally by the formula 24X wherein is phosphorous or nitrogen and each R is an alkyl or aryl group containing from 1 to 8 carbon atoms.Polymeric quaternary ammonium salts such as C14H32N2 CH 2 3x wherein SsZ has a value of at least 2 are also suitably employed. The mono , di and tri amines are advantageously utilized, either alone or in combination with a quaternary ammonium compound or other templating compound. Mixtures of two or more templating agents can either produce mixtures of the desired product or the more strongly directing templating species may control the course of the reaction with the other templating species serving primarily to establish the pH conditions of the reaction gel.Representative templating agents include tetramethylaflonium, tetraethylammonium, tetrapropylasonium or tetrabutylammonium ions tetrapentyla ionium ion di n propylamine tripropylamine triethylamine triethanolamine piperidine cyclohexylamine 2 methylpyridine N,N dimethylbenzylamine N,N dimethylethanolamine choline N,N dimethylpiperazine 1,4 diazabicyclo t2,2,2, octane N methyldiethanolamine, N nethylethanolamine N methylpiperidine 3 methylpiperidine N methylcyclohexylamine 3 methylpyridine 4 methylpyridine quinuclidine N,N dimethyl 1,4 diazabicyclo 2,2,2 octane ion di n butylamine, neopentylamine di n pentylamine isopropylamine t butylamine ethylenediamine pyrrolidine and 2 imidazolidone. Not every templating agent will direct the formation of every species of XAPO, i.e., a single templating agent can, with proper manipulation of the reaction conditions, direct the formation of several XAPO compositions, and a given xAPO composition can be produced using several different templating agents. The reactive phosphorus source is preferably phosphoric acid. but organic phosphates such as triethyl phosphate have been found satisfactory, and so also have crystalline or amorphous aluminophosphates such as the AlPO4 compositions of U.S.P. 4,310,440. Organo phosphorus compounds. such as tetrabutylphosphonium bromide do not, apparently, serve as reactive sources of phosphorus, but these compounds do function as templating agents. Conventional phosphorus salts such as sodium metaphosphate, may be used, at least in part. as the phosphorus source, but are not preferred. The preferred aluminum source is either an aluminum alkoxide, such as aluminum isoproproxide.or pseudoboehmite. The crystalline or amorphous aluminophosphates which are a suitable source of phosphorus are, of course, also suitable sources of aluminum Other sources of aluminum used in zeolite synthesis, such as gibbsite, sodium aluminate and aluminum trichloride, can be employed but are not preferred. The reactive source of iron can be introduced into the reaction system in any form which permits the formation in situ of reactive ferrous or ferric ions capable of forming the framework tetrahedral unit of FeO2. Advantageously, iron compounds including oxides, hydroxides, sulfates, acetates, nitrates and the like may be employed. Other reactive sources of iron include freshly precipiated iron oxide and gamma FeOOR may be employed. The reactive source of titanium can be introduced into the reaction system in any form which permits the formation in situ of reactive titanium capable of forming the TiO2 framework tetrahedral unit. Titanium compounds which may be employed herein include titanium alkoxides, titanium halides, e.g., titanium tetrachloride, water soluble titanates, titanium chelates and the like. The reactive source of cobalt, magnesium, manganese and zinc can be introduced into the reaction system in any form which permits the formation in situ of reactive ions of cobalt, magnesium, manganese and zinc capable of forming the framework tetrahedral units of such.Advantageously, salts, oxides, alkoxides or hydroxides of metals are employed such as cobalt chloride hexahydrate, alpha cobaltous iodide, cobaltous sulfate, cobalt acetate, cobaltous bromide, cobaltous chloride, zinc acetate, zinc bromide, zinc formate, zinc iodide, zine sulfate heptahydrate, magnesium acetate, magnesium bromide, magnesium chloride, magnesium iodide, magnesium nitrate, magnesium sulfate, manganous acetate.manganous bromide, manganous sulfate and the like. While not essential to the synthesis ofXAPO compositions, stirring or other moderate agitation of the reaction mixture and or seeding the reaction mixture with seed crystals of either the XAPO species to be produced or a topologically similar aluminophosphate. aluminosilicate or molecular sieve composition, facilitates the crystallization procedure. After crystallization the XAPO product may be isolated and advantageously washed with water and dried in air. The as synthesized tAP0 generally contains within its internal pore system at least one form of the templating agent employed in its formation. Most commonly the organic moiety is present. at least in part, as a charge balancing cation as is generally the case with as synthesized aluminosilicate zeolites prepared from organic containing reaction systems. It is possible, however, that some or all of the organic moiety is an occluded molecular species in a particular XAPO species. As a general rule the templating agent, and hence any occluded organic species, is too large to move freely through the pore system of the XAPO product and must be removed by calcining the XAPO at temperatures of 2000C to 7000C to thermally degrade the organic species. In a few instances the pores of the XAPO product are sufficiently large to permit transport of the templating agent, particularly if the latter is a small molecule, and accordingly complete or partial removal thereof can be accomplished by conventional desorption procedures such as carried out in the case of zeolites.It vill be understood that the term as synthesized as used herein does not include the condition of the XAPO phase wherein the organic moiety occupying the intracrystalline pore system as a result of the hydrothermal crystallization process has been reduced by post synthesis treatment such that the value of m in the composition formula IR MxAl P C2 has a value of less than 0.02. The other symbols of the formula are as defined hereinabove. In those preparations in which an alkoxide is employed as the source of M , aluminum or phosphorus, the corresponding alcohol is necessarily present in the reaction mixture since it is a hydrolysis product of the alkoxide.It has not been determined whether this alcohol participates in the synthesis process as a templating agent. For the purposes of this application, however, this alcohol is arbitrarily omitted from the class of templating agents, even if it is present in the as synthesized XAPO material. Since the present XAPO compositions are n formed from NO2, A102 and PC2 tetrahedral units which, respectively, have a net charge of n 0. l or 2 , 1 and 1, the matter of cation exchangeability is considerably more complicated than in the case of zeolitic molecular sieves in which, ideally. there is a stoichiometric relationship between AlO tetrahedra and 2 charge balancing cations.In the instant compositions. an A1O2 tetrahedron can be balanced electrically either by association with aPO2 tetrahedron or a simple cation such as an alkali metal cation, a proton H , a cation of SeN present in the reaction mixture, or an organic cation derived from the templating agent. Similarly a NOn2 tetrahedron can be balanced electrically by association with PC2 tetrahedra, a cation of M present in the reaction mixture, a simple cation such as an alkali metal cation1 a proton H , organic cations derived from the templating agent.or other divalent or polyvalent metal cations introduced from an extraneous source. It has also been postulated that non adjacent A102 andPO2 tetrahedral pairs can be balanced by Na and OH , respectively Flanigen and Grose.Molecular Sieve Zeolites I, ACS, Washington, DC 1971 The XAPO compositions of the present invention may exhibit cation exchange capacity when analyzed using ion exchange techniques heretofore employed with zeolitic aluminosilicates and have pore diameters which are inherent in the lattice structure of each species and which are at least about 3A in diameter. Ion exchange of XAPO compositions is ordinarily possible only after any organic moiety derived from the template, present as a result of synthesis has been removed from the pore system.Dehydration to remove water present in the as synthesized XAPO compositions can usually be accomplished, to some degree at least, in the usual manner without removal of the organic moiety. but the absence of the organic species greatly facilitates adsorption and desorption procedures.The XAPO materials have various degrees of hydrothermal and thermal stability, some being quite resarkable in this regard, and function well as molecular sieve adsorbents and hydrocarbon conversion catalysts or catalyst bases. In preparing the XAPO composition it is preferred to use a stainless steel reaction vessel lined with an inert plastic material, e.g., polytetrafluoroethylene, to avoid contamination of the reaction mixture. In general, the final reaction mixture from which each XAPO composition is crystallized is prepared by forming mixtures of less than all of the reagents and thereafter incorporating into these mixtures additional reagents either singly or in the form of other intermediate mixtures of two or more reagents. In some instances the reagents admixed retain their identity in the intermediate mixture and in other cases some or all of the reagents are involved in chemical reactions to produce new reagents. The term mixture is applied in both cases.Further, it is preferred that the intermediate mixtures as well as the final reaction mixtures be stirred until substantially homogeneous. X ray patterns of reaction products are obtained by X ray analysis using standard X ray powder diffraction techniques. The radiation source is a high intensity, copper target. X ray tube operated at 50 Kv and 40 ma. The diffraction pattern from the copper K alpha radiation and graphite monochromator is suitably recorded by anX ray spectrometer scintillation counter, pulse height analyzer and strip chart recorder. Flat compressed powder samples are scanned at 2 2 theta per minute, using a two second time constant. Interplanar spacings d in Angstrom units are obtained from the position of the diffraction peaks expressed as 28 where e is theBragg angle as observed on the strip chart.Intensities are determined from the heights of diffraction peaks after subtracting background,BIo being the intensity of the strongest line or peak, and I being the intensity of each of the other peaks. Alternatively, the X ray patterns may be obtained by use of computer based techniques using Copper K alpha radiation with Sieman s TypeK 805 X ray sources and with Siemens D 500 X ray powder diffractometers available from SiemensCorporation, Cherry Hill, NJ. As will be understood by those skilled in the art the determination of the parameter 2 theta is subject to both human and mechanical error, which in combination, can impose an uncertainty of about 0.4 on each reported value of 2 theta. This uncertainty is, of course, also manifested in the reported values of the d spacings, which are calculated from the 2 theta values. This imprecision is general throughout the art and is not sufficient to preclude the differentiation of the present crystalline materials from each other and from the compositions of the prior art.In some of the X ray patterns reported, the relative intensities of the d spacings are indicated by the notations vs, s, m w and vw which represent very strong, strong, medium, weak and very weak, respectively In certain instances the purity of a synthesized product may be assessed with reference to its X ray powder diffraction pattern. Thus, for example, if a sample is stated to be pure, it is intended only that the X ray pattern of the sample is free of lines attributable to crystalline impurities, not that there are no amorphous materials present. The molecular sieves of the instant invention may be characterized by their x ray powder diffraction patterns and such may have one of the x ray patterns set forth in the following Tables A through V, wherein said x ray patterns are for both the as synthesized and calcined forms unless otherwise noted TABLE A APO 5 2e d A Relative Intensity 7.3 7.65 12.1 11.56 m vs 19.5 19.95 4.55 4.46 m s 20.9 21.3 4.25 4.17 m vs 22.2 22.6 4.00 3.93 w vs 25.7 26.15 3.47 3.40 w m TABLE B tAPO ll 20 d A Relative Intensity 9.3 9.65 9.51 9.17 m s 20.2 20.6 4.40 4.31 m s 20.9 21.3 4.25 4.17 s vs 22.0 22.5 4.04 3.95 m s 22.5 22.9 3.95 3.92 m s 23.0 23.4 3.87 3.80 m vs TABLE C XAPO 14 2 d A Relative Intensity 8.6 8.9 10.3 9.93 vs 13.0 6.81 w 21.9 22.2 4.06 4.00 w 25.4 3.51 w 27.5 3.24 w 29.7 3.01 w TABLE D XAPO 16 26 d A Relative Intensity 11.3 11.6 7.83 7.63 m vs 18.7 18.9 4.75 4.70 w s 21.9 22.3 4.06 3.99 m vs 26.5 27.0 3.363 3.302 w m 29.7 30.05 3.008 2.974 w m TABLE E XAPO 17 26 d A Relative Intensity 7.7 7.75 11.5 11.4 vs 13.4 6.61 S vs 15.5 15.55 5.72 5.70 s 19.65 19.7 4.52 4.51 w s 20.5 20.6 4.33 4.31 vs 31.8 32.00 2.812 2.797 w s TABLE F XAPO 18 29 d A Relative Intensity 9.6 9.65 9.21 9.16 vs 15.5 15.55 5.72 5.70 m 16.9 17.1 5.25 5.19 m 20.15 20.25 4.41 4.39 m 20.95 21.05 4.24 4.22 m 31.8 32.5 2.814 2.755 m TABLE G XAPO 20 29 d A Relative Intensity 13.7 14.25 6.46 6.22 m vs 19.55 20.0 4.54 4.44 w s 24.05 24.5 3.70 3.63 m vs 34.3 35.0 2.614 2.564 vw w 42.5 43.0 2.127 2.103 vw w TABLE H XAPO 31 29 d A Relative Intensity 8.5 8.6 10.40 10.28 m s 20.2 20.3 4.40 4.37 m 21.9 22.1 4.06 4.02 w m 22.6 22.7 3.93 3.92 vs 31.7 31.8 2.823 2.814 w m TABLE J XAPO 33 2B d A Relative Intensity 9.25 9.55 9.56 9.26 w m 12.5 12.9 7.08 6.86 vs 16.9 17.3 5.25 5.13 w m 20.45 20.9 4.34 4.25 w m 23.85 24.25 3.73 3.67 w m 26.05 26.35 3.42 3.38 w m 27.3 27.6 3.27 3.23 vs as synthesized form TABLE Kw XAPO 33 2e d A Relative Intensity 13,15 13.4 6.73 6.61 vs 18.05 18.35 4.91 4.83 m 18.4 18.6 4.82 4.77 m 26.55 26.7 3.36 3.34 m 32.0 32.1 2.80 2.79 m calcined form TABLE L XAPO 34 RTI ID 23.2 26 d A Relative Intensity 9.4 9.65 9.41 9.17 S vs 15.9 16.2 5.57 5.47 vw m 17.85 18.4 4.97 4.82 w s 20.3 20.9 4.37 4.25 m vs 24.95 25.4 3.57 3.51 vw s 30.3 30.8 2.95 2.90 w s TABLE n XAPO 35 20 d A Relative Intensity 10.8 11.1 8.19 7.97 m 17.2 17.4 5.16 5.10 s vs 21.0 21.25 4.23 4.18 m s 21.8 22.0 4.08 4.04 vs 31.8 32.2 2.814 2.788 m TABLE N XAPO 36 20 d A Relative Intensity 7.7 7.9 11.5 11.2 vs 16.2 16.6 5.47 5.34 w m 18.9 19. 3 4.70 4.60 m s 20.6 20.8 4.31 4.27 w s 21.8 22.0 4.08 4.04 m 22.2 22.5 4.00 3.95 w m TABLE O KAPO 37 20 d A Relative Intensity 6.1 6.3 14.49 14.03 vs 15.5 15.7 5.72 5.64 w m 18.5 18.8 4.80 4.72 w m 23.5 23.7 3.79 3.75 w m 26.9 27.1 3.31 3.29 w m TABLE P XAPO 39 20 d A Relative Intensity 9.4 9.6 9.41 9.21 w m 13.3 13.6 6.66 6.51 m vs 18.0 18.4 4.93 4.82 m 21.2 21.5 4.19 4.13 m s 22.5 23.0 3.95 3.87 s vs 30.2 30.5 2.96 2.93 w m TABLE O XAPO 40 2e d A Relative Intensity 7.5 7.7 11.79 11.48 vw m 8.0 8.1 11.05 10.94 s vs 12.4 12.5 7.14 7.08 w vs 13.6 13.8 6.51 6.42 m s 14.0 14.1 6.33 6.28 w in 27.8 28.0 3.209 3.187 w m TABLE R XAPO 41 2e d Relative Intensity 13.6 13.8 6.51 6.42 w m 20.5 20.6 4.33 4.31 w m 21.1 21.3 4.21 4.17 vs 22.1 22.3 4.02 3.99 m s 22.8 23.0 3.90 3.86 m 23.1 23.4 3.82 3.80 w m 25.5 25.9 3.493 3.440 w m TABLE S XAPO 42 2e d A Relative Intensity 7.15 7.4 12.36 11.95 in vs 12.5 12.7 7.08 6.97 m s 21.75 21.9 4.09 4.06 m s 24.1 24.25 3.69 3.67 vs 27.25 27.4 3.273 3.255 s 30.05 30.25 2.974 2.955 RTI ID 24.20 m S TABLE T XAPO 44 29 d A Relative Intensity 9.4 9.55 9.41 9.26 vs 13.0 13.1 6.81 6.76 w m 16.0 16.2 5.54 5.47 w m 20.6 20.85 4.31 4.26 s vs 24.3 24.4 3.66 3.65 w vs 30.7 30.95 2.912 2.889 w s TABLE U XAPO 46 2e d A Relative Intensity 7.2 8.1 12.3 10.9 vs 21.2 21.8 4.19 4.08 w m 22.5 23.0 3.95 3.87 vw m 26.6 27.2 3.351 3.278 vw w 28.5 29.0 3.132 3.079 vw w TABLE V APO 47 2e d A Relative Intensity 9.4 9.41 vs 15.9 16.0 5.57 5.54 w m 20.5 20.6 4.33 4.31 s 24.5 24.7 3.63 3.60 w 25.8 25.9 3.45 3.44 w 30.4 30.5 2.940 2.931 w The following examples are provided to further illustrate the invention and are not provided to be limiting thereof ExamPle 1 Preparation of FeMgAPC 5 a F eMgAPO 5 is prepared from a reaction mixture having a composition, expressed in terms of the molar oxide ratios of the components of the reaction mixture, of 1.0 2.0 TPA 0.05 0.2 Fe 0 0.1 0.4 2q Mg0 0.5 1.0 Al C 0.5 1.0 P2o5 40 100HO 2 where TPA denotes tripropylanine and q denotes the oxidation state of iron.

PROCESS APPLICATIONS The XAPO compositions of the present invention are, in general, hydrophilic and adsorb water preferentially over common hydrocarbon molecules such as paraffins. olefins and aromatic species, e.g.. benzene, xylenes and cumene. Thus the present molecular sieve compositions as a class are useful as desiccants in such adsorption separation purification processes as natural gas drying1 cracked gas drying. Water is also preferentially adsorbed over the so called permanent gases such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen. These XAPOs are therefore suitably employed in the drying of reformer hydrogen streams and in the drying of oxygen, nitrogen or air prior to liquifaction. The present XAPO compositions also exhibit novel surface selectivity characteristics which render them useful as catalyst or catalyst bases in a number of hydrocarbon conversion and oxidative combustion reactions. They can be impregnated or otherwise loaded with catalytically active metals by methods well known in the art and used, for example, in fabricating catalyst compositions having silica or alumina bases. Of the general class, those species having pores larger than about 4A are preferred for catalytic applications. Among the hydrocarbon conversion reactions catalyzed by XAPO compositions are cracking1 hydrocracking, alkylation for both the aromatic and isoparaffin types,isomerization including xylene isomerization, polymerization, reforming, hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, transalkylation, dealkylation, hydrodecyclization and dehydrocyclization. Using XAPO catalyst compositions which contain a hydrogenation promoter such as platinum or palladium, heavy petroleum residual stocks, cyclic stocks and other hydrocrackable charge stocks, can be hydrocracked at temperatures in the range of 4000F to 8250F using molar ratios of hydrogen to hydrocarbon in the range of between 2 and 80, pressures between 10 and 3500 p.s.i.g., and a liquid hourly space velocity LHSV of from 0.1 to 20, preferably 1.0 to 10. The ZAP0 catalyst compositions employed in hydrocracking are also suitable for use in reforming processes in which the hydrocarbon feedstocks contact the catalyst at temperatures of from about 7000F to 10000F. hydrogen pressures of from 100 to 500 p.s.i.g.. LHSV values in the range of 0.1 to 10 and hydrogen to hydrocarbon molar ratios in the range of 1 to 20, preferably between 4 and 12. These same catalysts1 i.e. those containing hydrogenation promoters, are also useful in hydroisomerizations processes in which feedstocks such a normal paraffins are converted to saturated branched chain isomers. Hydroisomerization is carried out at a temperature of from about 2000F to 6000F, preferably 300 F to 5500F with an LHSV value of from about 0.2 to 1.0. Hydrogen H is supplied to the reactor in admixture with the hydrocarbon Hc feedstock in molar proportions H Hc of between 1 and 5. At somewhat higher temperatures, i.e. from about 6500F to 10000F. preferably 850 F to 9500F and usually at somewhat lower pressures within the range of about 15 to 50 p.s.i.g.. the same catalyst compositions are used to hydroisomerize normal paraffins. Preferably the paraffin feedstock comprises normal paraffins having a carbon number range of C7 C20. Contact time between the feedstock and the catalyst is generally relatively short to avoid undesireable side reactions such as olefin polymerization and paraffin cracking. LHSV values in the range of 0.1 to 10, preferably 1.0 to 6.0 are suitable. The unique crystal structure of the presentXAPO catalysts and their availability in a form totally void of alkali metal content favor their use in the conversion of alkylaromatic compounds.particularly the catalytic disproportionation of toluene, ethylene, trimethyl benzenes, tetramethyl benzenes and the like. In the disproportionation process, isomerization and transalkylation can also occur. Group VIII noble metal adjuvants alone or in conjunction with Group VI B metals such as tungsten, molybdenum and chromium are preferably included in the catalyst composition in amounts of from about 3 to 15 weight of the overall composition.Extraneous hydrogen can, but need not, be present in the reaction zone which is maintained at a temperature of from about 400 to 7500F. pressures in the range of 100 to 2000 p.s.i.g. and LHSV values in the range of 0.1 to 15. Catalytic cracking processes are preferably carried out with XAPO compositions using feedstocks such as gas oils, heavy naphthas, deasphalted crude oil residue, etc., with gasoline being the principal desired product. Temperature conditions of 850 to 11000F, LHSV values of 0.5 to 10 and pressure conditions of from about 0 to 50 p.s.i.g. are suitable. Dehydrocyclization reactions employing paraffinic hydrocarbon feedstocks, preferably normal paraffins having more than 6 carbon atoms, to form benzene. xylenes. toluene and the like are carried out using essentially the same reaction conditions as for catalytic cracking. For these reactions it is preferred to use the XAPO catalyst in conjunction with a Group VIII non noble metal cation such as cobalt and nickel. In catalytic dealkylation wherein it is desired to cleave paraffinic side chains from aromatic nuclei without substantially hydrogenating the ring structure a relatively high temperatures in the range of about 8000 10000F are employed at moderate hydrogen pressures of about 300 1000 p.s.i.g., other conditions being similar to those described above for catalytic hydrocracking.Preferred catalysts are of the same type described above in connection with catalytic dehydrocyclization. Particularly desirable dealkylation reactions contemplated herein include the conversion of methylnaphthalene to naphthalene and toluene and or xylenes to benzene. In catalytic hydrofining, the primary objective is to promote the selective hydrodecomposition of organic sulfur and or nitrogen compounds in the feed, without substantially affecting hydrocarbon molecules therein. For this purpose it is preferred to employ the same general conditions described above for catalytic hydrocracking, and catalysts of the same general nature described in connection with dehydrocyclization operations. Feedstocks include gasoline fractions. kerosenes, jet fuel fractions.diesel fractions. light and heavy gas oils.deasphalted crude oil residua and the like any of which may contain up to about 5 weight percent of sulfur and up to about 3 weight percent of nitrogen. Similar conditions can be employed to effect hydrofining, i.e., denitrogenation and desulfurization, of hydrocarbon feeds containing substantial proportions of organonitrogen and organosulfur compounds. It is generally recognized that the presence of substantial amounts of such constituents markedly inhibits the activity of hydrocracking catalysts. Consequently, it is necessary to operate at more extreme conditions when it is desired to obtain the same degree of hydrocracking conversion per pass on a relatively nitrogenous feed than are required with a feed containing less organonitrogen compounds.Consequently. the conditions under which denitrogenation, desulfurization and or hydrocracking can be most expeditiously accomplished in any given situation are necessarily determined in view of the characteristics of the feedstocks in particular the concentration of organonitrogen compounds in the feedstock. As a result of the effect of organonitrogen compounds on the hydrocracking activity of these compositions it is not at all unlikely that the conditions most suitable for denitrogenation of a given feedstock having a relatively high organonitrogen content with minimal hydrocracking, e.g., less than 20 volume percent of fresh feed per pass, might be the same as those preferred for hydrocracking another feedstock having a lower concentration of hydrocracking inhibiting constituents e.g., organonitrogen compounds.Consequently, it has become the practice in this art to establish the conditions under which a certain feed is to be contacted on the basis of preliminary screening tests with the specific catalyst and feedstock. Isomerization reactions are carried out under conditions similar to those described above for reforming, using somewhat more acidic catalysts. Olefins are preferably isomerized at temperatures of 500 900 F, while paraffins.naphthenes and alkyl aromatics are isomerized at temperatures of 7000 10000F. Particularly desirable isomerization reactions contemplated herein include the conversion of n heptene and or n octane to isoheptanes, iso octanes, butane to iso butane, methylcyclopentane to cyclohexane, meta xylene and or ortho xylene to paraxylene, l butene to 2 butene and or isobutene, n hexene to isohexene, cyclohexene to methylcyclopentene etc. The preferred form of the catalyst is a combination of the XAPO with polyvalent metal compounds such as sulfides of metals of Group II A, Group II B and rare earth metals. For alkylation and dealkylation processes the XAPO compositions having pores of at least SA are preferred. When employed for dealkylation of alkyl aromatics, the temperature is usually at least 3500F and ranges up to a temperature at which substantial cracking of the feedstock or conversion products occurs, generally up to about 7000F. The temperature is preferably at least 4500F and not greater than the critical temperature of the compound undergoing dealkylation. Pressure conditions are applied to retain at least the aromatic feed in the liquid state. For alkylation the temperature can be as low as 2500F but is preferably at least 3500F. In the alkylation of benzene, toluene and xylene, the preferred alkylating agents are olefins such as ethylene and propylene.
