# A process for the production of olefinic acids and esters by catalytic oxydehydrogenation.

## Abstract
Olefinic acids and esters, such as methacrylic acid and methylmethacrylate, are prepared by contacting in the pres ence of molecular oxygen the corresponding saturated acid or ester, such as isobutyric acid ro methylisobutyrate with the ca talyst of the empirical formula Mo₁₂ PO₀.₁ ₃ M₀.₁ ₃ Cu₀.₁ ₂ V₀.₁ ₂ X₀.₀₁ ₂ M
