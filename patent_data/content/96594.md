# Inflatable slide.

## Abstract
An inflatable escape slide when folded with tripple folds, as indicated in Figure 5, is attached at 24 to the bottom of an aircraft hatchway, and when inflated at 26 begins to unfold first as shown in Figure 9, and after release of links 62 , as shown in Figure 9, and after release of links 60 as shown in Figure 10, and after release of links 58 as shown in Figure 1 fully expanded. Restraints, 34, 44 for retaining the unflated slide folded, include releasable links 58, 60, 62 which are designed to release at predetermined loads in particular there is a transverse line of three restraints 38, 42, 40 across the top of the slide of which the links are arranged to release under loads of which at least one is different from the loads for release of the others to control the direction of expansion of the slide as it is inflated. Strap means 94, 108 acts to isolate the releasable links from random transient deployment forces.
