## Description
This invention relates to an aqueous liquid containing as essential components a fat soluble substance selected from vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin D, vitamin K, ubidecarenone, derivatives of these substances, bisabolol, salicylic acid esters, squalane, isopropyl myristate and vegetable oils, furthermore lecithin and at least one alcohol selected from ethanol and isopropanol. Examples have heretofore been known in which large amounts of nonionic surface active agents are used in order to clearly dissolve or emulsify fat soluble substances in water It is well known, however, that by any of various administration methods, nonionic surface active agents cause some undesirable trouble to humans. In view of this, techniques were developed for using lecithin, a natural substance with relatively high safety, instead of synthetic surfactants, as seen, for example, in Japanese Patent Applications Laid Open Nos. 62010 1980, 147228 1980, 38314 1980, 83912 1977, 83911 1977, 50124 1974 and 126821 1975. With these techniques, exertion of a strong mechanical stress is required in order to supplement the weak emulsifying power of lecithin. Furthermore, since the average particle diameter of particles in the resulting emulsion is as large as 0.5 µm or more and the particle size distribution is broad, the stability of the emulsion with the lapse of time is not sufficient. With this background, some of the present inventors studied a system composed of a fat soluble substance, lecithin and ethanol, and discovered a system composed of 1 part by weight of a fat soluble substance, 0.1 to 10 parts by weight of lecithin and 1 to 50 parts by weight of ethanol, which can be emulsified by addition of water. An invention based on this discovery was applied for a patent in Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 56315 1978 JP A 53 56315A . Subsequently, the present inventors studied a system consisting essentially of a fat soluble substance, lecithin and an alcohol, which can be converted to a stable emulsion or solution by a simple convenient method. It is necessary that the concentration of alcohol in the emulsion or solution should be as high as 20 to 50 for example, in order to use the emulsion or solution as a lotion, a skin lotion or a milky lotion. The present inventors made investigations in order to obtain such a system. Generally, the addition of a large amount of an alcohol to an emulsion or solution of a fat soluble substance prepared by emulsifying or dissolving it with the aid of a surface active substance such as lecithin adversely affects the emulsion or solution, and such an addition, without adverse effects, has been considered to be a difficult technique. For example, BBA 298 1973 1015 1019 reported that when an ethanol solution of lecithin was added to a 0.16M aqueous solution of KCl, the concentration of ethanol in the resulting solution was 7.5 at the highest. In order, therefore, to prepare a stable emulsified or solubilized system by adding a fat soluble substance and lecithin to an aqueous solution of an alcohol at a high concentration, it is considered necessary to set certain numerical limitations on the proportions of these ingredients to be blended. The present inventors studied systems containing various components starting with a system containing an alcohol at a high concentration, in view of the need to use an emulsified or solubilized liquid containing a fat soluble substance, lecithin and an alcohol as essential components as a lotion, a skin lotion or a hair tonic. It was first found that besides ethanol, isopropanol can be used as the alcohol, and ethanol can be incorporated at a concentration of up to 50 by volume. It was also found that when the alcohol is ethanol to be incorporated at a concentration of not more than 50 V V of the aqueous liquid and when it is added in an amount of less than 50 parts by weight per part by weight of the fat soluble substance, the amount of lecithin should be less than 0.1 part by weight per part by weight of the fat soluble substance when ethanol is incorporated in an amount of 50 parts by weight or more per part by weight of the fat soluble substance, the amount of lecithin should be not more than 50 parts by weight per part by weight of the fat soluble substance and when the alcohol is isopropanol in a concentration of 10 to 30 V V in the aqueous liquid, the amount of lecithin should be not more than 50 parts by weight per part by weight of the fat soluble substance. The foregoing findings have led to the present invention. It is an object of this invention to provide a stable aqueous liquid containing a fat soluble substance, lecithin and ethanol or isopropanol as essential components. This object is solved by an aqueous liquid containing as essential components a fat soluble substance selected from vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin D, vitamin K, ubidecarenone, derivatives of these substances, bisabolol, salicylic acid esters, squalane, isopropyl myristate and vegetable oils, furthermore lecithin and at least one alcohol selected from ethanol and isopropanol The aqueous liquid containing a fat soluble substance in accordance with this invention denotes an emulsion or solution. The aqueous liquid contains a fat soluble substance, lecithin as well as ethanol or iso propanol as essential components. The fat soluble substance used in this invention denotes one or more of fat soluble substances for medicines, cosmetics and foodstuffs, which are soluble in ethanol or iso propanol. The fat soluble substance is selected from vitamins A, E, D and K, ubidecarenone and derivatives of these substances, coenzymes such as CoQ₈ and CoQ₁₀, salicyclic acid esters, methyl salicylate, monoglycol salicylate, bisabolol, α bisabolol, squalane and isopropyl myristate and vegetable oils. The vegetable oils denote for instance sesame oil, soybean oil and olive oil. Lecithin used in this invention denotes a phospholipid containing substance extracted from egg yolk or from a vegetable oil and optionally purified, or a hydrogenation product thereof. It also denotes synthetic glycerophosphoric acid esters of the following general formula, or mixtures thereof. In the formula, R₁ and R₂ each represent a hydrogen atom or a saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon having 8 to 20 carbon atoms, and R₃ represents for instance a hydrogen atom, choline, ethanolamine, serine, inositol, glycerol. Ethanol and iso propanol are used either singly or in combination. When they are used in combination, the ratio between the two may be any desired one. The volume of ethanol is not more than 50 of the aqueous liquid of this invention containing a fat soluble substance. The percentage here expresses V V . In the aqueous liquid of this invention, the proportions of the fat soluble substance, lecithin and the alcohol are limited. They differ whether the alcohol used is ethanol or iso propanol. When ethanol is used in an amount of less than 50 parts by weight per part by weight of the fat soluble substance, the amount of lecithin is less than 0.1 part by weight. When ethanol is used in an mount of at least 50 parts by weight per part by weight of the fat soluble substance, the amount of lecithin is not more than 50 parts by weight. When iso propanol or the ethanol isopropanol mixture is used as the alcohol, the amount of lecithin is not more than 50 parts by weight. The aqueous liquid of this invention may optionally contain for instance emulsifiers, isotonizing agent, buffers, dissolution aids, corrigents, antiseptics and stabilizers in addition to the essential components, as shown in Examples given hereinafter. The addition of these optional substances is free and does not limit the present invention. The aqueous liquid of this invention is used for medicines, cosmetics and foodstuffs. Specific forms of the aqueous liquid include, for example, an injectable preparation, an orally administrable liquid preparation, a lotion, a hair tonic and a drink preparation. The aqueous liquid of this invention may be prepared by general ordinary methods for the production of aqueous liquids. For example, the fat soluble substance and lecithin are dissolved in ethanol or iso propanol. The solution is added to an aqueous solution containing optional components, and the mixture is stirred in an ordinary manner. The stirring may, for example, be carried out by applying a pressurizing treatment or an ultrasonication treatment. The following Experimental Examples illustrate the effects of the present invention.
