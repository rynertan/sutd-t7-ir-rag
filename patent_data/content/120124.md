# Loading ejecting device for a magnetic disk.

## Abstract
A loading ejecting device for loading and ejecting a floppy disk 26 into and from a magnetic disk reproducing apparatus has a holder 28 for containing the disk therein. The holder is supported by a pair of guide plates 14 to be movable directly between a first position where the disk can be inserted into or ejected from the holder and a second position where the disk can be reproduced or recorded. A loading ejecting member 54 is supported by the guide plates to be movable between an initial position and an advanced position. The member is urged by tension springs 74 toward the advanced position and is locked by a locking member 80 in the initial position. When the disk is inserted into the holder, a push member 90 supported on the holder is moved by the disk to push the locking member, thereby disengaging the locking member from the loading ejecting member. As a result, the loading ejecting member is moved from the initial position to the advanced position thereby moving the holder from the first position to the second posi tion.
