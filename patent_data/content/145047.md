## Description
TELECOMMUNICATION LINE CIRCUIT AND ASSOCIATED POLARITY REVERSAL CIRCUIT The present invention relates to a telecommunication line circuit including at least one line amplifier whose output is coupled to a telecommunication line conductor, and DC biasing means associated with said amplifier to apply thereto a DC bias signal of such a value that said amplifier cannot saturate when an AC metering signal is applied to it. Such a telecommunication line circuit is already known from European patent application No 81201204.5 0078347 J. DANNEELS et al 7 1 . To prevent the saturation of the line amplifier by the metering signal, during the transmission of such a signal the bias signal is given a constant value which is larger than the maximum amplitude of this metering signal. As a consequence a relatively considerable amount of power is unnecessarily dissipated in the amplifier during the time when the metering signal has an amplitude smaller than this maximum amplitude. An object of the present invention is to provide a telecommunication line circuit of the above type, but with reduced power dissipation of the amplifier during the transmission of a metering signal. According to the invention this object is achieved due to the fact that said bias signal varies in function of said metering signal. Another characteristic feature of the present telecommunication line circuit is that said bias signal varies with the envelope of said metering signal. In this way the bias signal is not larger than strictly necessary to prevent saturation of the amplifier by the metering signal so that the power dissipation is reduced to a minimum. The present invention also relates to a polarity reversal circuit for a telecommunication line circuit for reversing the polarity on at least one line conductor in a telecommunication line circuit, said polarity reversal circuit, including a differential amplifier with first and second intercoupled amplifier circuits having a common bias and having first and second inputs and first and second outputs, and a control signal source which when applying said control signal between said inputs gradually varies the current on at least said first output between predetermined first and second values. Such a polarty reversal circuit is already known from Belgian patent No 893 931 3.F. ORR 1 . In this known circuit the outputs of the differential amplifier are connected to respective ones of the conductors of the telecommunication line and the circuit is adapted to perform a compiementary polarity reversal simultaneously on both these conductors. Because the line current flows in the diffential amplifier the time required to perform the polarity reversion time is directly dependent on the value of this current.Moreover this known polarity reversal circuit includes an additional differential amplifier. Another object of the present invention is to provide a polarity reversal circuit of the above type, but which is of a simpler structure and is adapted to perform a polarity reversal on one line conductor only and in a time which is independent of the line current. According to the invention this object is achieved due to the fact that said first output is connected on the one hand to a DC input voltage via a first resistance and on the other hand to an input of an operational amplifier, whilst said second output is connected to a DC supply voltage, and that said common bias is provided by a constant current source. In this way and by means of only one differential amplifier the polarity at the first output may be reversed independently from the line current and on a constant time because a constant current flows through the amplifier. The above mentioned and other objects and features of the invention will become more apparent and the invention itself will be best understood by referring to the following description of embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein Fig. 1 represents a telecommunication line circuit according to the invention Fig. 2 shows a polarity reversal circuit according to the invention cooperating with the circuit of Fig. 1. Principally referring to Fig. 1, the telecommunication line circuit or subscriber line interface circuit shown therein includes a line amplifier DC control circuitLADC adapted to apply suitable DC bias voltages to the noninverting inputs TDC and RDC of operational line amplifiersLOAO and LOA1. The subscriber line interface circuit itself forms part of a line circuit connected in a telecommunication exchange between a switching network not shown and one end of a telephone line with conductors LIO and LI1. The other end of this line is connected to a subscriber subset TSS including a normally open hook switch HS. The tip and ring outputsTP and RG of the line amplifiers LOAO and LOA1 are coupled, on the one hand, to the respective line conductors LIO and LI1 via corresponding feed resistors RO and R1 and, on the other hand, to their respective inverting inputs TAC and RAC through equal feedback resistors R2 and R3 of same value respectively. LADC operates with the following supply voltages which is at ground potential V which is at 48 or 6Q Volts VAUX which is an auxiliary voltage and is 15 Volts above V VAG which is a voltage 7.5 Volts above V VRG which is a reference voltage 2.4 Volts above VAG B1 which is a bias voltage provided by a constant current source such that when applied to a transistor a constant current flows therein VEET which is a regulated voltage, LOAO and LOAl being each fed between V and VEET. As will be described hereinafter the control circuitLADC is able to apply a voltage VH V 2 AV orVL VEET to the non inverting input of each line amplifierLOAO cr LOA1. As a consequence a voltage VH V AV or VL VEET AV then appears at the output of this amplifier.Herein nV VRG VAG VE VAG , whereinVRG and VAG are the above mentioned voltages and VE is the envelope of a metering signal ME. As described in theBelgian patent 898 052 L. BIENSTMAN E . WILLOCRX 6 1 , this metering signal and also a speech signal are applied to the amplifiers in a balanced way by withdrawing currentsI i and I i from the inverting input of these amplifiers. Herein i is the speech metering current and I is a DC current having a value which will be given later. LADC includes two voltage to current converters of which the first includes operational amplifier OAl whose non inverting input constitutes input terminal VRG to which the above mentioned reference voltage VRG is applied. The output of 0A1 is connected to the gate electrode of NMOS transistor NM1 whose source electrode is directly connected to the inverting input of OAl and trough reference resistor P4 to VAG. To its drain electrode voltage VAUX is connected through the emitter to collector path of diode connected PNP transistor T1. Because the voltage at the source electrode of NM1 VRG VAG is equal to VRG a current I1 equal to R4 flows through in R4, i.e. in the source electrode of this transistor and also in the drain electrode thereof since the gate current of NM1 is negligible. Thus the first converter accurately converts input reference voltage VRG into a constant output current 11. The second voltage to current converter is similar to the first one and includes operational amplifierOA2, an associated NMOS transistor NM2 and resistor R5 which has a value equal to that of R4 and of R2 and R3. This converter moreover includes a peak or envelope detector constituted by a series diode D1 and a parallel circuitC1, R6 connected between the cathode of D1 and VAG.When a metering signal MS is to be transmitted from the line circuit to the subscriber subset TSS, it is also applied to the like named non inverting input MS of OA2. As a consequent thereof the envelope VE of this signal appears at the junction point of the source electrode of NM2 and of R5 through which then flows a metering signal dependent current I2 equal toVE VAG R5 . The current 12 is also the drain current of NM2 because the gate current thereof is negligible.The total current I flowing in the collector of T1 is then equal to I 11 I2 twEG 7A 7AG, SV and hence comprises a R4 R5 fixed part I1 and a metering signal dependent part I2 which is zero when no metering signal is applied to OA2. The base of transistor T1 is coupled via terminal X to the impedance synthesis circuit described in the above mentioned Belgian patent so that the current I is reflected to this circuit. As already mentioned the currents I i and I t i, wherein i is a speech metering current, are withdrawn from the inverting inputs TAC and RAC of the line operational amplifiers LOAO and LOA1 respectively.These currents therefore flow from the outputs TP and RG toTAC and RAC through the feedback resistors R2 and R3 of LOAO and LOA1, as shown. The supply voltage V is connected to VAG via the series connection of resistor R7, the collector to emitter path of NPN transistor T2 and two separate branches, the first of which includes the collector to emitter path of NPN transistor T4 and resistor R8 in series and the second of which comprises the drain to source path of NMOS transistor NM3 and resistor R9 in series. The values of the resistor R8 and R9 are equal and the same as those of R4 and R5. Resistor R7 has a value equal to twice that of R4 or R5. NPN transistorT2 forms with NPN transistor T3 a Darlington amplifier, the base of T3, T5 being connected to VAUX so that the voltage at the junction point JP1 of the above two branches can never be higher than VAUX 2VBE.This is done to protect NM3 whose gate electrode is connected to that of NM2 and the drain current of which is equal to I2 because its source resistor R9 has the same value as the source resistorR5 of NM2. The base of T4 is connected to VRG so that its emitter current I3 is equal toVRG VAG VBE i.e. to R8 EMI6.1 since R8 R4. As a consequence a current substantially equal toEMI6.2 flows in the emitter branch of transistor T2 i.e. to JP1.When neglecting the voltage drop in T2 15 the voltage at the lower end Z of resistor R7 is therefore equal to v R7.I VBE . R7 RB or V 2 V 2VBE R7 2 and I 2AV since R8 2 and I R4 R7 The lower end Z of R7 is also connected to the bases of NPN transistors T5 and T7 which together with NPN transistors T6 and T8 respectively from Darlington amplifiers.V is connected to the commoned collectors of T5 and T6 via diode connected PMOS transistor PM1 which is connected in current mirror configuration with PMOS transistor PM2. The emitter of T6 is connected to VEET through resistor R10.The source electrode of PM2 is connected to V and its drain electrode is connected to V via diode connected NMOS transistor NM4 whose gate electrode constitutes output terminal BR33 leading to the polarity reversal circuit BRC of Fig. 2. The commoned collectors of T7 and T8 are directly connected to V and the emitter of T8 is connected to the non inverting inputs TDC of LOAO and RDC of LOA1 via the series connection of resistors Rll and R12 and R13 and R14 respectively. The junction points VTI and VRI of Rll and R12 and of R13 andR14 are connected to output terminal BR22 and BRll respectively which are also connected to the polarity reversal circuitBRC. The values of Rll and R13 are equal to that of R10.To be noted that the emitter of T8 also constitutes a control output terminal VX for a filter and feed circuit described in the Belgian patent No 898 049 L. BTrNSmMAN J. PIETERS 3 1 The Darlington amplifiers T5, T6 and T7, T8 constitute buffers so that current can be drawn from V without substantially modifying the voltage at the lower end Z of R7. Because the voltage at this end Z is equal to V 2 lav 2 VBE whilst the voltage drop in the base emitter junctions of T5 and T6 and of T7 and T8 is equal to 2VBE the voltages at the upper end of R10 and at the emitter VX of T8 are each equal to VH V 2 AV Hence, the voltages at the ends of R10 am equal toVH and VL VEET respectively, so that a current, say 14, flows therein, this current being reflected via PM1, PM2,NM4 in the polarity rewrsal circuit BRC connected to terminalBR33. From the above it also follows that normally the voltage VH V 2 V is present at the non inverting inputs of LOAO and LOA1 and that currents I i and I i are withdrawn from the inverting inputs of these amplifiers.As a consequent the DC voltage VH at the output of LOAO andLOA1 is equal to VH VH R2.I VH R3.I V because R2.I R3.I ss V. By means of the polarity reversal circuit BRC which will be described hereinafter the voltage VL VEET instead of VH may be applied to either one or both of the noninverting inputs of LOAO and LOA1 and in this case DC voltage GL at the output of LOAO or LOA1 is equal to VL VL R2.I VC 1 R3.I VL VL V In other words the output of each of LOAO and LOA1 is either on VH or on VL and because VH is EV below V whereas VL is A V above VEET, the amplifiers LOAO and LOAl cannot be saturated by the metering signal MS which has an amplitude smaller than bv. The polarity reversal circuit 3RC which is represented in Fig. 2 is connected to the above terminalsBRll, BR22 and BR33 of LADC. BRC has a common part and two individual reversal circuits RCO and RC1 which are identical and of which only RC1 is shown in detail. RCO and RC1 are each able to realize a so called polarity reversal on LI1 and Llorespectively. This means that either Vfl or VL can be connected to this line conductor LI1 or LIO.RC1 includes a differential amplifier comprising NPN transistors T9 andT10 whose collectors are connected to input terminal BRIl andVAUX respectively and whose emitters are commonly connected to V via a constant current source constituted by NMCS transistor NM5 which is connected in current mirror configuration on the one hand with NM4 of LADC and on the other hand with NMOS transistor NM6 associated to RCO. The above mentioned current I4 therefore flows in the drain paths of these transistors NM5 and NM6. The base electrodes of T9 andT10 are connected to the source electrodes of respectiveNMOS transistors NM7 and NM8 whose drain electrodes are commoned to VAUX.In order to have a sufficient base current injected in T9 as well as in T10 the bases of these transistors are connected to V via the drain to source paths of NMOS transistors NM9 and NM10 respectively, the gate electrodes of NM9 and NM10 being interconnected. In the common part of BRC, VAG is connected to Vvia diodes D2, D3, D4, D5 and the drain to source path ofNMOS transistor NMll in series, as well as to the gate electrode of NMS via the series connection of the source to drain path of PMOS transistor PM3, input terminal IT1 of RC1 and resistor R15. The junction point of R15 and the gate electrode of NMB is connected to VAUX via capacitor C2 which together with R15 constitutes an integration or delay circuit.C2 is isolated from T10 by NMB. The junction point JP2 ofD5 and SMll is connected to the above input terminal IT1 through the source to drain path of PMOS transistor PM4.In a similar way VAG and JP2 are connected to input terminalITO of RCO via PMOS transistors PM5 and PM6 respectively. The gate electrodes of PM3 and PM4 are controlled from a same control terminal BR1 via inverter 11 and directly respectively, whilst the gate electrodes of PM5 and PM6 are controlled from a same control terminal BRO through inverter I2 and directly respectively. The junction point of D3 and D4 is connected to the gate electrode of NM7 which isolates D2 D5 from T9 and the common gate electrodes of NM9 and NM10 are connected to that of NMll and to that of diode connected NMOS transistor NM12 whose source electrode is connected to V .VAUX is connected to the drain electrode of NM12 via the source todrain path of PMOS transistor Pun7. The gate electrode of PM7 is biased by a voltage B1 such that it is continuously conductive and that a constant current, say I5, flows in the drain paths of PM7 and NM12. This current I5 is mirrored in the drain paths of NM9, NM10 and NMll. Control bits BRO and BR1 may be applied to the above mentioned like named respective control terminals BRO and BR1 to vary the voltage at TDC ofLOAO or at RDC of LOA1 between VH and VL or vice versa in order to change the voltage at the output TP of LOAO or atRG of LOAl between VH and VI or vice versa. This will be explained hereinafter. Depending on BR1 being equal to 1 or O a voltage equal to VAG or VAG 4VD is applied to the input terminal IT1 of RC1, VD being the voltage drop over any of the diodes D2 to D5. Similarly when BRO is equal to 1 or O a voltage equal to VAG or VAG 4VD is applied to the input terminal ITO of RCO respectively. Independent of the values of BRO and BRI a voltage VAG 2VD is always directly applied to the gate electrode of NM7. This means that when bit BR1 changes from 1 to O the voltage applied to the base of T10 varies from aboutVAG to about VAG 4VD or vice versa with a time constant determined by R15, C2. On the contrary, the base of T9 remains at a constant value about equal to VAG 2VD. The same is true for RCO. In other words, the differential voltage applied to the differential amplifier T9, T10 may be varied between 2VD to 2VD, these voltages being such that either one of the transistors T9 and T10 is blocked by VAG 4VD , the other being then fully conductive by VAG . As a result the current in T9 drawn from BRll varies from I4 to O or vice versa when the control voltage at input terminal IT1 of RC1 varies from VAG 4VD to VAG or vice versa. As this current is drawn from the emitter terminal of T8 which is at the voltage VH through resistor R11 which has the same value as R10, it is clear that the voltage at terminal BRil and therefore the voltage applied to RDC of LOA1 then varies from VL to VH or vice versa. The same is true for terminal BR22 and terminal TDC of LOAO. The above variation between VH and VL and therefore between VH and VL at TP or RG occurs in a gradual way without harmonic distortion as follows from pages 158 to 160 of the book Analysis and design of analog integrated circuits by R.P. Gray and R.G. Meyer, John Wiley and Sons, 1980. This is also described in the above mentioned Belgian patent No 893 931 B.F. ORR 1 . The effect of the time constant determined by R15, C2 is to fix the time required for this change. While the principles of the invention have been described above in connection with specific apparatus, it is to be clearly understood that this description is made only by way of example and not as a limitation on the scope of the invention.
