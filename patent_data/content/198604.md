# Glow discharge deposition apparatus having confined plasma region.

## Abstract
Apparatus for confining an ionized plasma developed dur ing glow discharge deposition of thin film semiconductor alloy material to a preselected plasma region to deposit homogene ous semiconductor alloy material and to prevent etching of previously deposited semiconductor material. The apparatus 26 includes elongated plates 7a disposed at ends of a cathode 34 in a deposition chamber 32 . The plates are negatively biased during the deposition process to repel elec trons in and thereby confine the plasma.
