# Catalytic hydrodealkylation of alkylated phenols.

## Abstract
Selective catalytic steam dealkylation of ortho and para positions of alkylated phenols is accomplished by reacting ortho and or para alkylated phenols with steam in the presence of a catalyst comprised of magnesium oxide, optionally manganese oxide and optionally an organic bin der said reaction may preferably takes place in the presence of an oxidizing atmosphere to extend catalyst life. High degrees of conversion are obtained without loss of the hydroxyl radical of the alkylated phenols.
