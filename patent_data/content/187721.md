# PREPARATION OF PEPTIDE SUBSTRATES FOR VIRUS SPECIFIED PROTEASES

## Abstract
Specific tetrapeptide substrates are disclosed which comprise a C terminal indicator group linked by an amide or ester linkage to peptide sequences resembling Picornavirus protease cleavage recognition sites. Such substrates may be used to detect the activity of the corresponding virus specified protease.
