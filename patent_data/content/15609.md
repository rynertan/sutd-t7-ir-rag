# Soft absorbent imprinted paper sheet and method of manufacture thereof.

## Abstract
Wet laid paper having, when creped, improved bulk, softness, and flexibility a relatively large cross machine direction to machine direction stretch ratio and improved burst to total tensile stremgth ratio. The paper is charac terized by an array of uncompressed zones 42 which are in staggered relation in both the machine direction and the cross machine direction and by having each uncompres sed zone defined by a picket lik discontinuous lineament of compacted fibrous material 43 . The invention also includes a process for making the paper through the use of an imprinting fabric which is configured to precipitate the requisite compacting of the picket like lineaments prior to final drying and creping of the paper.
