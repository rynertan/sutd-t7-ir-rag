## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTION 3 AMINO 5 SUBSTITUTED 6 HALO N 3 ,4 DIHYDRO I or 4,4 DISUBSTITUTED 6 SUBSTITUTED 1,3,5 TRIAZIN 2 YL 2 PYRAZINECARBOXAMIDES, PROCESS FOR PREPARING AND PHARMACEUTIC L COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THE SAME .BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The background to this invention, U.S. Patent 3,313,813 patented April 11, 1967 and issued to Edward J.Craoge, Jr., shows novel 3 amino 5,6 disubstitutedpyrazinoyl guanidine compounds. The compounds of the 813 patent are useful because they possess diuretic and natriuretic properties. They differ from most of the known, effective diuretic agents, however, in that the compounds of the 813 patent selectively enhance the excretion of sodium ions while simultaneously causing a decrease in excretion of potassium ions. The potassium loss, which is caused by known diuretics, often results in a severe muscular weakness. Since the compound of the 813 patent prevent the potassium depletion, they have this decided advantage as diuretics.As diuretic agents, they can be used for the treatment of edema, hypertension and other diseases or conditions known to be responsive to this therapy and are especially useful when used in combination with or concomitantly with potassium losing diuretic agents. It has been found in U.S. Patent 3,313,813 that the pyrazinoylguanidine compounds therein described when co administered with other diuretic agents known to enhance the elimination of potassium ions along with sodium ions, will maintain the potassium ion excretion at approximately the normal or control rate and thus overcome this undesirable property of other diuretic agents. In actuality, applicants compounds in the instant case as further described, accomplish the objective previously achieved by using a combination of pyrazinoylguanidine compounds of the 3,313,813 patent with diuretic agents which cause elimination of sodium with concomitant excessive potassium elimination. Thus, the compounds of the instant case are effective eukalemic saluretic agents.Since the compounds of the instant invention are thus eukalemic saluretic agents, they constitute single entities which are useful for the treatment of edema and hypertension and other diseases or conditions known to be responsive to this therapy.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The instant case covers novel 3 amino 5 substitu ted 6 halo N 3,4 dihydro or 4 ,4 disubstituted 6 substitu ted 1,3,5 triazin 2 yl 2 pyrazinecarboxamides and processes for making the same. The novel compounds of this invention are depicted in Formula I below EMI2.1 whereinR and R1 are the same or different and are hydrogen or C1 5 alkyl, C2 5 alkenyl or C3 6 cycloalkyl Rê and R are the same or different and are hydrogen orC1 5 alkyl Rê and R may also be joined with the carbon atom to which they are attached to form a 3 7 membered carbon ring X is halo such as chloro, fluoro, bromo or iodo Y is OH, SH, C1 5 alkoxy, C1 5alkylthio and NR4R5 wherein R4 is hydrogen or C1 5 alkyl and R5 is hydrogen, C1 5 alkyl, CN, CONH2,EMI3.1 NO2 or NH2 and the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof. In the above formula, C1 5 alkyl means branched or straight chained alkyl groups such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, n propyl, butyl, pentyl, isopentyl and the like.C1 5 alkenyl is represented by allyl, propenyl and the like and C3 6 cycloalkyl is represented by cyclopropyl, cyclohexyl, cyclopentyl and the like. The invention includes compounds which are the tautomeric form of the compounds of Formula I namely to tautomeric forms of the formula EMI3.2 wherein R, R1, X, R2, R3, R4 and R5 are as defined forFormula I and Y is as defined above minus a hydrogen atom. Preferred compounds of this invention are those compounds of Formula I and the tautomeric form of FormulaII whereinR and R1 are hydrogen or C15 alkyl R and R3 are methyl X is chloro andY is OH, SH, C15 alkoxy, C15 alkylthio or cyanoamino and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. The compounds of this invention as shown byFormula I and the preferred compounds discussed above are useful because they possess diuretic and natriuretic properties. In addition, they are useful eukalemic saluretics, in other words, the compounds of the instant case cause neither loss or abnormal retention of potassium ions. In contradistinction, the pyrazinoylguanidine compounds ofU.S. Patent 3,313,813 do cause a decrease in the excretion of potassium ions. However, other well known diuretics such as furosemide, chlorthalidone and acetazolamide cause an increase in potassium excretion which often results in muscular weakness. Applicants compounds combine in a single agent the advantages of a combination of the known pyrazinoylguanidine diuretics of U.S. Patent 3,313,813 which decrease potassium with the known diuretics which cause a potassium loss.Thus, the compounds of this invention maintain the excretion of potassium at approximately normal levels while causing an increased renal elimination of sodium ions and water which is the desirable characteristic of the diuretic. Also covered within the scope of the aboveFormula I compounds and the preferred compounds are the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof.These salts can be made by reacting the free base with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid such as for example, hyrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, hydrobromic acid or ise thionic acid. These salts, as stated above, are to be considered as included in this invention. The products of this invention can be administered to patients both human and animal in the form of pills, tablets, capsules, elixirs, injectable preparations and the like. They can be administered either orally or parentally or any other feasible method as known to those skilled in the art such as intravenously or in the form of suppositories and the like. The type of formulation to be administered can be comprised of one or more of the compounds of this invention as the only essential active ingredient of the pharmaceutical formulation. The formulation is merely combinations of the active ingredient mentioned with pharmaceutically inert carriers and the like. The compounds of this invention are advantageous ly administered at a dosage range of from about 5 mg. to about one gram per day or a somewhat higher or lower dosage at the physician s discretion, preferably in subdivided amounts on a 2 to 4 times a day regimen and most preferably at a dosage range from 10 to 500 mg. per day. It will be realized by those skilled in the art that the dosage range for any particular patient animal or human will depend upon the severity of the disease treated, weight of the patient and any other condition which the physician or other person skilled in the art will take account of. The compounds of Formula I can be prepared by any of the following processes which are depicted by four chemical reaction schemes. In all four reaction schemes R, RÚ, Rê, R , R4R5, X and Y are the same as is defined for Formulae I andII. REACTION IEMI6.1 REACTION IIEMI6.2 REACTION IIIEMI7.1 REACTION IVEMI7.2 The process in Reaction I involves reacting an active pyrazinoic acid amide such as the imidazole amide III with a 2 amino 3,4 dihydro 1,3,5 triazine to obtain the desired product. The reaction is conducted in a suitable solvent such as dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide and the like at a temperature of from 250C to the boiling temperature of the solvent but preferably from 500C to 1000C. The reaction is usually conducted with an excess of the triazine component and the desired product is isolated by filtration of the cooled reaction or by treatment of the reaction solution with water followed by filtration of the product. In Reaction II, the methylthio triazine carboxamide starting material IV is reacted with hydrogen sulfide gas in an organic solvent such as pyridine at a temperature of from 0 500C for a period of 1 24 hours. The end product V is isolated from the reaction mixture by known means such as for example by treating the reaction mixture with water. Similarly, the starting material IV can be dissolved in a solvent such as butanol and reacted with H2NCN to yield the product shown as Compound VI in Reaction SchemeII. This reaction is generally carried out at a temperature of 500 to reflux temperature of the solvent for a time of about 1 24 hours. The product VI is isolated by known means such as for example by cooling the reaction and filtering the product. In Reaction III, the 6 ethoxy triazine carboxamide starting material VII is reacted with trimethyl silyl iodide in an organic solvent such as sulfolane at a temperature of from 25 100 C for a period of from 1 24 hours to yield 6 oxo triazine pyrazine carboxamide compounds. Finally in Reaction IV starting material VIII is reacted with a ketone in a solvent such as dimethylformamide at 500 to reflux temperature of solvent for 1 24 hours.to yield a similar 6 oxo end product shown as Compound IX.
