## Description
The present invention relates to a novel process for producing caerulein. More particularly, this inven 4 tion relates to a process for sulfonation of 0 desulfo 5 05 acetylcaerulein, deacetylation of the resultant acetylcaerulein followed by convention to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. Furthermore, this invention provides a sulfonation reagent, a complex of sulfur trioxide with a basic copolymer. Caerulein is a decapeptide obtained from the skin of Hyla caerulea, an Australian amphibian and displays pharmacological actions to the gall bladder and the pancreas. Caerulein, of which international nonproprietary name is ceruletide, is used as a diagnostic agent to examine the functions of a gall bladder and a pancreas. Caerulein is a decapeptide of which structure is 5 oxo L prolyl L glutaminyl L aspartyl 0 sulfo L tyrosyl Lthreonyl glycyl L tryptophyl L methionyl L aspartyl L phenylalanine amide. Attention has been paid to the physiological activity of caerulein and the methods for producing it have been investigated. The production of the main chain of the above peptide can easily be achieved according to the conventional method for producing peptides, but it is a problem to introduce the sulfo group of the tyrosine residue at the 4 position in synthesis of caerulein. L. Bernardi et al. discloses sulfonation of 0 desulfo 05 acetylcaerulein in Experientia 23, 700 1967 . The method introduces the sulfo group by the reaction with a large excess amount of a complex of sulfur tri dde with anhydius pyridine in dimeitiylformamide. It is very difficult to isolate and purify the objective compound from by products accompanied by decomposition of the remaining complexes and from the contaminations produced by the side reaction. As the result, it is unavoidable to decrease the yield and purity of the product. M. Galantino discloses a sulfonation with a complex of sulfur trioxide with an organic base in an aqueous medium in UK patent No. 2,016,478. The process yields the objective compound in high yield and high purity. However, complicated procedure for purification is not avoidable to separate by product from the remaining complexes and impurities resulted from side reactions. The present inventors have simplified the isolation step of the objective compound with the introduction of sulfo group by employing a complex of sulfur trioxide and a basic copolymer and succeeded in obtaining the objective compound in high yield and high purity, which accomplishes the present invention. The sulfonation of 0 desulfo 05 deacetylcaerulein is achieved with under heterogeneous conditions in anhydrous solvents with the above complex being insoluble in solvents.After the termination of the reaction, the basic copolymer from which the sulfur trioxide has been consumed and the complex unreacted are filtrated off. The filtrate is condensed under reduced pressure to give 05 acetylcaeru lein, which is deacetylated to give caerulein. The rerulting caerulein, if desired, can be converted into the pharmaceutically acceptable salts according to the conventional method for forming salts. According to the process of the present invention, the objective caerulein or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be produced without such complicated isolation and purification procedures as the countercurrent distribution requiredin the prior art. Accordingly, the present invention can be employed as an industrially applicable, economical, and simple manufacturing process. In the above definition, o4 desulfo 05 acetyl caerulein means caerulein in which tyrosine residue at the 4 position is lacking in the sulfo group and the hydroxy group of the threonine residue at the 5 position is modified by an acetyl group. In the followings, the process of the present invention is explained in detail. As a basic copolymer, copolymers of vinylpyridines e.g. 4 vinylpyridine, 2 methyl 5 vinylpyridne, etc. or tert amine containing compounds such as aminoalkylated vinylbenzenes e.g. 4 dimethylaminomethyl vinylbenzene etc. with divinylbenzene are employed. The ratio of the former to the latter is about 1 1 to 9 1, preferable 2 1 to 5 1, most preferably 3 1 to 4 1. These copolymers are easily available on the market as a weak basic anion exchange resin. The resins having a capacity of about 3.0 to 6.0 meq ml, especiallly 4.0 to 5.5 meq ml are pns fered. icroporous resin is favorable. The complex of sulfur trioxide with a basic copolymer can be produced by adding sulfur trioxide to the above mentioned basic copolymer in an organic solvent under stirring. The production may be carried out in accordance with the method of Imoto et al. EKogyo KagakuZasshi, Japan, vol. 65, 1658 1962 . In the sulfonation of the present invention, 04 desulfo 05 acetylcaerulein or its salts inert to the sulfonation are employed as a starting material. The above complex of sulfur trioxide and a basic copolymer is allowed to react with the above starting material under ice cooling to at room temperature, preferably under icecooling, in anhydrous solvents. As the reaction solvents, those inert to the reaction such as dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, hexamethylphosp triamide, etc. are selected dimethylformamide is preferable. The reactiqn terminates within 1 to 20 hours. After the termination of the reaction, the complex is filtrated and the solvent is distilled off from the filtrate under reduced pressure to give 05 acetyl caerulein as a residue. Caerulein is obtain by deacetylation of this residue or alternatively by immediate treatment for deacetylation of the above filtrate without evaporation under reduced pressure. Deacetylation is conducted in a weakly basic aqueous solvent in a usual manner. when the final objective compound is thediethyl amine salt, it is profitable that the deacetylation is effected in an aqueous solution of diethylamine because contamination of impurities in the final product is decreased to a small degree. The purity of obtained caerulein is more than 90 and if desired it may be purified moreover by chromatography or reprecipitation. Besides, when the deacetylation is effected with diethylamine and the resultant solution of diethylamine salt is adjusted to pH about 2.0 to 4.0 with, for example, acetic diluted hydrochloric acid and the like, caerulein free base is precipitated in remarkably high purity. This purification procedure is very simple and effective. If the pharmaceutically acceptable salts are desired, the corresponding inorganic or organic bases are employed to convert the above obtained caerulein to the salts. In general, caerulein forms tribase addition salts and so, for example, an aqueous solution of di ethylamine is added to an aqueous solution of caerulein to give caerulein tridiethylamine salt. The following examples serve to illustrate but are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.Example 1 1 Preparation of the complex of sulfur trioxide with a basic copolymer Anhydrous copolymer 10 g of 4 vinylpyridine with divinylbenzene manufactured by Koei Kagaku kogyo co., Ltd.
