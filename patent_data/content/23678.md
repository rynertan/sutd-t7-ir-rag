## Description
HARD GRANULAR ACTIVATED CARBON MANUFACTURED FROM SUB BITUMINOUS COAL TREATED WITH SOLID BORIC ACID AND PROCESS FOR PREPARING SAME BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention This invention relates to granular activated carbon manufacture, and more particularly to a new and improved process for making hard granular activated carbon from sub bituminous coal treated with solid boric acid, and to a new and improved hard granular activated carbon made by such process and having properties which make it suitable for use in liquid or gas phase applications, depending upon the amount of acid employed.2. Glossary of Terms In order to facilitate a clear understanding of this invention, various terms of art employed herein are defined as follows. Abrasion number is a measure of the resistance of the activated carbon granules to degrading on being mechanically abraded. It is measured by contacting a sample with steel balls in a pan on a machine and shaking the contents for a given time and determining the resultant particle size distribution and hence the mean particle diameter. The abrasion number is the ratio of the final average mean particle diameter to the original average mean particle diameter determined by screen analysis times 100. Activated carbon is carbon which is activated by heating to high termperature preferably with steam of carbon dioxide as the gaseous activating agent in producing an internal porous particle structure. Activa t i o n or activating means heating coal at high temperatures on the order of about 600 0C. to about 1100 0C. in the presence of a gaseous activating agent, as is well known in the art. The heating rate during activation from the minimum activation temperature to the maximum activation temperature may vary widely, e.g., from about 100 to about 1000 C. per hour, but usually is nearer 100 C. per hour. Adsorp ion i sto the n is a measurement of the adsorptive capacity of an adsorbent Cviz. granular activated carbon as a function of the concentration, or pressure, of the adsorbate viz. N2 at a given temperature. It is defined as the constant temperature relationship between the amount absorbed per unit weight of adsorbent and the equilibrium concentration, or partial pressure. Apparent dens ity is the weight per unit volume of homogeneous granular activated carbon. To assure uniform packing of the granules during measurement, a vibrating trough is used to fill the measuring device. Ash is a principal mineral constituent of coal, carbon and pitch. It is normally defined as a weight percent basis after a given amount of sample is reduced to ash. Average mean particle diameter is a weighted average diameter of a granular activated carbon sample. A screen analysis is run and the average particle diameter is calculated by multiplying the weight of each fraction by its average diameter, adding the products, and dividing by the total weight of the sample. The average diameter of each fraction is taken as the size midway between the sieve opening through which the fraction has passed and the sieve opening on which the fraction was retained. It usually is expressed in mm. Carbon tetrachloride activity number is the steady state percentage increase in the weight of a bed of activated carbon after air which has been saturated with carbon tetrachloride at 000. is passed through the carbon at 25 0C. It is expressed as a percentage number. Charring means heating coal at low temperatures on the order of about 175 C. to about 275 C. in the presence of oxygen. Coking va l ue is usually expressed as percent residual carbon.obtained when a dry sample of coal, tar or pitch is vaporized or pyrolized for a specific time at a specific temperature that limits the available oxygen supply ASTM MethodD 2416 . The coking value, expressed as percent residual carbon, indicates the coke forming properties of the material. Devolatilizing means heating coal at intermediate temperatures on the order of about 400 C. to about 600 C. in an oxygen free atmosphere. Direct activation or directly activating means heating a coal, preferably in a granular form, directly without prior charring and devolatilization and rapidly at a heating rate of about 500qC per hour or more to an activating temperature higher than the devolatilization temperature of the order of 6000 to 1100 0C. in an atmosphere containing a gaseous activating agent and maintaining the desired activating temperature for the desired period of time. Granular activated carbon is activated carbon which has a particle size, i.e., mesh , which is not less than about 60 and preferably not less than about 40. Iodine number is the milligrams of iodine adsorbed by one gram of granular activated carbon at an equilibrium filtrate concentration of 0.02 N iodine. It is measured by contacting a single sample of carbon with an iodine solution and extrapolating to 0.02 N by an assumed isotherm slope.This number can be correlated with the ability of granular activated carbon to adsorb low molecular weight substances. Mesh or mesh size is the particle size of granules as determined by the U.S. Sieve Series or the Tyler Series. Usually, this term refers to the sizes of the two screens, in either of the above Series, between.which the bulk of a sample falls. For example,. 8 30 mesh or 8 by 30 mesh or 8 x 30 mesh means that 90 by weight of the sample will pass through a No. 8 screen but will be retained on a No. 30 screen. Alternatively, this term refers to a maximum particle size, such as in defining the fineness of powder material. For example, 65 by weight 325 mesh powder means that 65 by weight of a given sample passes through a No. 325 mesh screen. Molasses number is calculated from the ratio of the optical densities of the filtrate of a molasses solution treated with a standard activated carbon and the activated carbon in question. Pitch is a black or dark viscous substance obtained as a residue in the distillation of organic materials and especially tars. Powder means powdered activated carbon which has a particle size, i.e., mesh , which is smaller than about 40 and preferably smaller than about 60. The larger the mesh number, the smaller the size. Sub bituminous coal is an intermediate stage coal which ranks above lignite and brown coals, but below bituminous coal. In the as received condition it has, by weight, 1 approximate analysis of from about 10 to about 25 moisture, from about 35 to about 45 volatile material, from about 2 to about 5 ash, and from about 25 to about 45 fixed carbon, and 2 an ultimate analysis of from about 65 to about 75 carbon, from about 4 to about 8 hydrogen, from about 0.6 to about 2.0 nitrogen, and from about 0.5 to about 1.0 sulfur. See ASTM Standard D 388 66. Surface area is the amount of surface area per unit weight of granular activated carbon it is determined from the nitrogen adsorption isotherm by the Brunauer, Emmett andTeller BET method, and it is expressed in m gram. Volnnetri c Iodine and Molasses Numbers are determined by multiplying by the apparent density, in order to express these properties independently of such density.3. Discussion of Art Granular activated carbon is useful in both liquid and gas phase applications. In the former, granular activated carbon has been found to be particularly useful in water and waste water treatment, not only because it is highly effective in purifying the intake, as well as the effluent from municipal and industrial systems, but also because it can be regenerated for repeated use.However, in order to accomplish these objectives, it must possess certain properties, namely a minimum 2 surface area of about 900 m gram for adequate adsorption cap acity, a minimum volumetric Iodine number of about 410, preferably about 480, for adequate adsorption, especially of low molecular weight substances, a minimum volumetric Molasses number of about 90, preferably about 100, for adequate decolorizing, a maximum ash content by weight of not more than about 12 , and preferably not more than about 8 for purity, a minimum abrasion number of about 70 and preferably not less than about 80, for adequate hardness in maintaining granular integrity in use and in regeneration, and a minimum apparent density of not less than about 0.46 gram cc, preferably not less than about 0g48 gram cc, for obtaining the dense, closely packed beds and columns needed in water and waste water treatment. In gas phase applications, granular activated carbon also is particularly useful for gas and air purification. In addition to the above properties of density, hardness and purity, the volumetric Iodine number should not be below a minimum of about 460 and the volumetric Molasses number should be less than 90, preferably a volumetric Iodine number of at least about 480 and a volumetric Molasses number of not more than about 85.Likewise, the carbon should have a minimum carbon tetrachloride number of about 50, preferably at least about 60. Hard granular activated carbon can be obtained from bituminous, sub bituminous and brown.coals, such as disclosed inU.S. Patents 4tl44t.193 4,032,476, 4,131r566, 4,149,994, 4,149,995, and 4,157,314. However, in each of these patents, liquid mineral acids were employed, and until the present invention, it was not known that anyone else had accomplished this objective by solid boric acid treatment of sub bituminous coal. In the 193, 566, and 994 patents, a dilute aqueous solu tion of inorganic mineral acid was employed, requiring an acid removal step prior to further processing, in order to avoid corrosion of the heat treating equipment. In the 476 and 995 patents, a small amount of concentrated mineral acid was mixed with the coal granules, thereby eliminating the acid removal step, but requiring special lining of the heat treating equipment in order to avoid the corrosive action of the acid. As for the heat treatment itself, each of the aforesaid patents except the 566 patent discloses the elimination of the charring or low temperature heat oxidation step found to be necessary in dealing with bituminous coal. In the 566 patent, both the acrid treatment and charring steps were found to be necessary for attaining the desired results when treating low rank agglomerating but not good coking bituminous coal. In the 314 patent, it has been found that both the charring and devolatilization steps could be eliminated prior to the activation step. Likewise the disclosures of U.S. Patents 3,483,134, 3,876,505, and 4,014,817 are of interest, but each requires the charring or low temperature heat oxidation step, and none discloses a hard granular activated carbon product. While the use of aqueous boric acid has been disclosed inU.S. Patent 1,438,113 for making decolorizing carbon, the source material was of either vegetable or animal origin, with the boric acid merely being considered as a possible substitute for the preferred phosphoric acid in the aqueous solution, and with the liquid acid constituting at least one third and preferably two thirds of the mixture prior to carbonization.Hence, this patent does not teach the manufacture of hard granular activated carbon from sub bituminous coal treated with a considerably smaller amount of solid boric acid. Moreover, U.S. Patent 2,437,174 discloses the use of an aqueous solution of boric acid in treating vegetable matter in order to produce active carbon by burning in air, with sufficient liquid boric acid being used until 1 15t by weight of boron compound is impregnated into the material. Once again, the patent does not suggest employing solid boric acid to treat mineral matter such a sub bituminous coal nor producing a hard granular activated carbon, but rather a fibrous product. In each of these two patents, the resulting product is leached with water to extract the boric acid following the heat treatment. In contrast, in the present inventive process, recognition of the property of boric acid as being solid at room temperature permits the use of a considerably smaller amount of this acid in solid form, in order to simplify the production of hard granular activated carbon, with the amount of the solid acid employed determining the suitability of the resulting hard granular product for use in liquid or gas phase applications. Although the coal, as received, may be crushed and sized to form granules prior to blending with the solid boric acid followed by powderizing, this is not absolutely necessary, because the coal and solid boric acid readily may be simultaneously blended and reduced to form a uniform mixture in fine powder form, with or without the admixture of a carbonaceous binder such as pitch.This is particularly helpful when treating the coal on a large scale, because the initial granulating step can be eliminated, and the blending and powderizing steps can be combined. Moreover, there is no necessity for washing out the boric acid either prior to or following the appropriate heat treatment, which not only eliminates the charring or low temperature heat oxidation step, but also can eliminate the separate devolatilizing step, such as by direct activation. Alternatively, the blending step can precede the powder izing step, and separate devolatilization and activation steps can be employed, with the charring step being eliminated in any event SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, a primary objective of the present invention is 1 to provide a new and improved process for making hard granular activated carbon from sub bituminous coal wherein the acid treatment is greatly simplified by completely eliminating not only the need for separate initial granulating and blending steps, as well as the use of an elevated temperature during blending, as when an acid in liquid form is employed, but also any necessity for removing the acid, either prior to or following heat treatment, which is further simplified by elimination of the charring or low temperature oxidation step or both this step and the separate devolatilization step prior to activation 2 to provide a new and improved hard granular activated carbon made by such process and having the aforementioned desired properties of adsorption Cas measured by volumetric Iodine number and carbon tetrachloride number decolorization as measured by volumetric Molasses number , purity Cas measured by ash content , hardness as measured by abrasion number , and density as measured by apparent density , which make it suitable for use in liquid and or gas phase applications. To this end, the invention includes 1 a process for making hard granular activated carbon from sub bituminous coal comprising compressing fine powder containing the coal to form shapes, reducing the shapes to form granules, and heat treating the granules until activated, wherein the improvement comprises blending and reducing a uniform mixture including the coal, from about 1 to about 10 of solid boric acid, and 0 to about 10 of carbonaceous binder to form such fine powder having a moisture content of not less than about 10 and not more than about 258 prior to compressing, and 2 hard granular activated carbon made by such process and having the physical characteristic of high granular integrity permitting repeated handling, use, regeneration and reuse.All percentages used herein are by weight, unless otherwise specified, and the shapes formed by compressing may be of various configurations larger than the granules such as pellets, briquettes, thin sheets of corrugated cross section, etc. Another object is to provide such process wherein the mixture is blended either before or simultaneously with reduction of the mixture to form the powder. A further objective is to provide such a process wherein the amount of acid employed is selected to make the resulting hard granular activated carbon suitable for use in liquid and or gas phase applications. For liquid phase applications, the acid range should be from about 1 to about 5 , preferably from about 2 to about 3 . For gas phase applications, the acid range should be from 5 to about 10 , preferably from about 7 to about 9 . Additional objectives and advantages of the invention will become apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description and accompanying drawing wherein BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING The single FIGURE is a block diagram or flow sheet illustrating schematically the various steps of the process, as well as the resulting product, both embodying the invention. DESCR EPTION or THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS In this detailed description, reference will be made to eight Examples which are illustrative of the invention. The following Examples 1 8 represent preferred embodiments of the present invention, which is represented schematically in the drawing. Referring to the drawing, it is to be noted that the sub bituminous coal, as defined above, usually contains in the as received condition, a moisture content of from about 10 to about 25 . Under such circumstances, it is neither necessary nor desirable to further adjust or control the moisture content of the coal prior to further processing.However, should the coal be unusually dry or unusually wet, the moisture can be adjusted to facilitate further processing as indicated in the upper right hand corner of the drawing.Likewise, the moisture adjustment can take place prior to compressing the fine powder, as indicated in the upper left hand side of the drawing. The important point to keep in mind as to moisture control is that the powder prior to compressing has a moisture content af not less than about 10 and not more than about 25 so that the shapes produced during compression will become densely packed and yield compact granules suitable for obtaining hard granular activated carbon following heat treatment.Continuing with the drawing, it is noted that the blending and powderizing steps are schematically illustrated together, although the blending step could be performed as a separate step hollowing an initial granulation step and prior to the powderizing step, and if desired, moisture adjustment could be made prior to or between such separate steps. Likewise, the heat treatment of the granules is generally indicated in the drawing, but this general indication is intended to include either the direct activation or separate devolatilization and activation steps, but without a charring or low temperature heat oxidation step in any event. The various batches of sub bituminous coal employed in the ensuing Examples, had the following typical weight percent analysis, in the as received condition and on a dry basis PROXIMATE ANALYSIS As Received Moisture 18.1 Volatile Material 35.86 43.78. Ash .2.95 3.605 Fixed Carbon 43.09 52.61 EXAMPLE 1 2000 grams of coal of 8 20 mesh, 174 grams of coal tar pitch 7.86 and 40 grams of solid boric acid cm.81 were blended by stirring together in a Hobart mixer for approximately 10 minutes. The mixture was pulverized in a hammer mill to give a powder, 91 of which passed through a standard 325 mesh screen. The powder was compacted into cylindrical pellets approximately 0.5 inch in diameter and 0.5 inch high, and having a density of 1.06 grams cc. These pellets were crushed in a jaw mill and granules in the size range of 6 20 6 20 were selected for further processing. 600 grams of the 6 20 mesh granules were placed in a stainless steel screen basket which was caused to be rotated within a tube furnace at about 2 rpm. The furnace was constructed so that the gaseous environment of the basket and granules could be controlled. The granules were heated to about 470 C while in an inner atmosphere of nitrogen or argon, and this temperature and atmosphere were maintained for 1 hour, after which time the material was allowed to cool to room temperature. 362 grams of carbonized i.e., devolatilized material 20 mesh with an apparent density of 0.651 grams cc were obtained, giving a yield on devolatilization of 60.3 . 300 grams of this material were activated as follows the granules were placed in a controlled atmosphere rotary kiln and were heated to a temperature of 870 0C under a nitrogen flow, at which time steam carried by flowing nitrogen was passed through the system at a rate corresponding to about 700 grams of water per hour.This was continued for a period of 2 hours, after which time the material was allowed to cool to room temperature under flowing nitrogen. 139 grams of granular activated carbon 30 mesh were obtained, producing an activation yield of 46.38 and an overall yield of 28 , The activated granules have the following properties apparent density 0.480 gram cc Iodine number 1045 volumetric 502 Molasses number 217 Cvolumetric 104 , abrasion number 89, and mean particle diameter 1.70 mm. EXAMPLE 2 The procedure of Example 1 was repeated, with the following differences. 50 grams of boric acid 2.25 were used, which made the pitch content 7.82 , with 90 of the fine powder being 325 mesh.

EXAMPLE 4 The procedure of Example 3 was repeated, but with the pitch being reduced to 57 grams 5.24 , changing the boric acid content to 2.76 . The pellets had a density of 1.17 grams cc, and following devolatilization, 309 grams of granules were obtained with an apparent density of 0.644 gram cc, giving a devolatilization yield of 51.5 . Following activation, 148 grams of granules were obtained, producing an activation yield of 49 and an overall yield of 25 .

EXAMPLE 5 The procedure of Example 4 was repeated, except that 2000 grams of coal were blended with 60 grams of pitch 2.84 and 50.grams of boric acid 2.37 . The pellets had a density of 1.14 grams cc, and following devolatilization, 330 grams were produced, having an apparent density of 0.643 gram cc, with a yield on devolatilization of 55 . Activation was continued for 2 hours, resulting in 156 grams of granular activated carbon, with an activation yield of 52 and an overall yield of 29 . The activated granules had an apparent density of 0.491 gram cc, an Iodine number of 1060 volumetric 5202, a Molasses number of 228 volumetric 112 , an abrasion number of 84, an.ash content of 11.7 , and a mean particle diameter of 1.40 mm. EXAMPLE 6 The procedure of Example 5 was repeated, except that the boric acid content was increased to 60 grams, thereby changing the boric acid and pitch contents to 2.83 each.The compacted pellets had. a density of 1.10 grams cc, and upon deyolatilization, 335 grams having an apparent density of 0.640 gram cc were obtained, producing a devolatilization yield of 52 . Activation was continued for a period of 2.25 hours, resulting in 150 grams of activated granules, producing an activation yield of 50 and an overall yield of 26 .The granular activated carbon had the following properties apparent density 0.483 gram cc Iodine number 1004 volumetric 485 Molasses number 230 volumetric 111 abrasion number 77, ash content 10.9 , and mean particle diameter 1.32 mm. EXAMPLE 7 The procedure of Example 6 was repeated, except that no pitch was.employed, which increased the boric acid to 2.91 , and 65 of the powder was 325 mesh. The pellets had a density of 1.27 grams cc, and following crushing 931 grams of 6 20 mesh granules were devolatilized, obtaining 460 grams with an apparent density of 0.644 gram cc and a yield on devolatilization of 49.4 . 300 grams were activated for 3.25 hours, producing 151 grams of granular activated carbon, at an activation yield of 50.2 and an overall yield 25 . The activated granules had an apparent density of 0.498 gram cc, an Iodine number of 1050 volumetric 523 , a Molasses number of 204 volumetric 102 , an abrasion number of 80, an ash content of 11.02 , and a mean particle diameter of 1.56 mm. From the foregoing Examples 1 7, it will be seen that an excellent water phase granular activated carbon can be produced by the inventive process, with or without the use of a carbonaceous binder such as pitch. The next Example is designed to demonstrate the applicability of the inventive process to successfully producing a gas phase granular activated carbon. EXAMPLE 8 The procedure of Example 6 was repeated, except that 180 grams of pitch 7.56 2 and 200 grams of boric acid 8.40 were used. Thus the pellets had a density of 1.30 grams cc, with 1169 grams of the granules produced on crushing resulting in 624 grams of devolatilized granules having an apparent density of 0.617 gram cc, giving a yield on devolatilization of 53.4 . Activation was continued for a period of 3 hours and 5 minutes. 153 grams of granular activated carbon was produced upon activation, giving an activation yield of 51 and an overall yield of 27 . The activated granules have the following propertles apparent density 0.461 gram cc Iodine number.1090 Cvolumetric 502 Molasses number 183 volumetric 84 carbon tetrachloride number 73.9 abrasion number 72, ash content 10.85 , and mean particle diameter 1.55 mm. From this Example, it will be seen that an excellent gas phase carbon can be produced by the inventive process where the boric acid content is increased above 5 . From the foregoing specific Examples, it is evident that hard granular activated carbon suitable for use in liquid or gas phase applications can be obtained by treatment with a relatively small amount about 1 to about 108 of solid boric acid, with the specific amount of boric acid needed being ad jus ed within the overall range to produce a liquid phase carbon about 1 to about 5 acid or a gas phase carbon 5 to about 10 acid . The term boric acid as used herein commercially has the formula H3B03 and is also known as ortho boric acid or boracic acid, and this was the particular form ofthe acid actually used in the aforesaid Examples. However, this term is intended to encompass metaboric acid, having the formula HB02 and tetra Cor pyro boric acid, having the formula H2B407, because these forms of boric acid also are solid at room temperature, and are composed of the same elements in slightly different proportions.
