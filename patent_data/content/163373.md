# Three way valve for automatic sequencing of fluid flow.

## Abstract
A three way valve 10 for automatic sequencing of fluid flow from a syringe 14 into an IV administration set comprises a housing 28 which forms a fluid chamber 54 having a first and a second inlet 48, 50 and an outlet 52 . A sleeve 56 having a fluid passageway 58 normally closed by a check valve 64 is slidably disposed within the fluid chamber 54 for reciprocal movement between a first position and a second position for respective fluid sealing engagement with the first and second inlets 48, 50 . With the sleeve 56 in the second position, fluid flows through the chamber 54 from the first inlet 48 to 52 . Engagement of a syringe 14 with the second inlet 50 urges the sleeve 56 into the first position to permit fluid flow from the syring 14 into the second inlet 50 and through the chamber 54 to be outlet 52 . Upon emptying of the syringe 14 , the syringe plunger 18 seals the second inlet 50 and urges against a probe 70 that opens the check valve 64 to permit resumption of fluid flow from the first inlet 48 to the outlet 52 .
