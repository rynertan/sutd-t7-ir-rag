# Dropout compensation system.

## Abstract
A dropout compensation system used with a video tape recorder, video disc, etc. is disclosed. In conventional modula tion systems, a reproduced signal which has been modulated in a modulation system in which the signal information is deter mined by the zero passage of the carrier is delayed in the form of the modulated signal, and if a dropout occurs, the repro duced signal is switched to the delayed signal by a first switch thereby to compensate for the dropout. The phase ofthe mod ulated signal becomes discontinuous each time the switch is operated, thus causing an offensive spark like interference up on demodulation. The invention is intended for reducing these noises and comprises a second demodulator 9 normally de modulating the delayed signal and a second switch 12 oper ated at a different timing from the first switch in response to the dropout. The noise is extracted by the operation of the second switch and the extracted noise is cancelled by being combined at opposite polarity with the demodulated repro duced signal which signal contains the noise but has been compensated for the dropout. A noise removing circuit utiliz ing the horizontal correlation of the signal may be easily added to the configuration of the present invention.
