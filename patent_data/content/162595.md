# Modifying coherent radiation.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for modifying the phase char acteristics of a coherent beam of radiation 7 are described. The apparatus comprises a laser 6 for generating a coherent beam of optical radiation 7 . A support 1 for a record me dium 1 sensitive to the radiation is provided, the beam of radiation 7 and the record medium 1 being relatively mov able whereby the beam of radiation scans the record me dium. First modulation means including an E O modulator 8 and beam computer 9 is provided for modulating the beam 7 in accordance with image information. Second modulation means including an A O modulator 10 or phase diffraction grating is responsive to a control function gen erated by a control function generator 11 . The control func tion has a frequency which is repeatedly swept through a range of frequencies at a relatively fast rate to control the transmission characteristics of the grating. A substantially spatially incoherent beam of radiation is transmitted rom the phase diffraction grating.
