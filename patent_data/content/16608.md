# Method and apparatus for signal transmission via an optical fiber.

## Abstract
The method comprises and the apparatus implements providing a first monochromatic beam of radiation reserved as a carrier radiation beam, providing a second monochro matic beam of radiation of preselected different frequency than the first monochromatic beam of radiation frequency interlocked with the first beam of radiation to a preselected degree dependent upon the transmission service to be effected reserved as an information radiation beam, impos ing an electrical signal to be transmitted upon the informa tion radiation beam, thereby responsively modulating the information radiation beam, combining the carrier radiation beam and the modulated information radiation beam, trans mitting the combined radiation via the optical fiber transmis sion line to a preselected destination, and detecting the combined radiation with a square law detector to thereby obtain a subcarrier signal constituting the difference in frequency between the carrier radiation beam and the information radiation beam upon which the electrical signal is modulated and demodulating to reconstitute the original electrical signal.
