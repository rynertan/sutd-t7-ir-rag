# Arylene sulfide polymer preparation.

## Abstract
A method for producing arylene sulfide polymer in which a reaction mixture containing at least one polyhalo substituted aromatic compound, at least one organic amide, at least one alkali metal carboxylate, Hâ‚‚S and water in an amount up to 5 weight percent of the total of the reaction mixture components is contacted at polymerization conditions for a time sufficient to procuce polymer. In a preferred embodiment, at least one alkali metal carboxylate is present in the reaction mixture.
