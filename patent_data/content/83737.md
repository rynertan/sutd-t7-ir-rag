It will of course be realised that the compounds of the formula I have chiral or prochiral centres, and thus are capable of existing in a number of stereoisomeric forms, and to mixtures thereof including racemates . The different stereoisomeric forms may be separated one from the other by the usual mthods, or any given isomer may be obtained by stereospecific or asymmetric synthesis. The invention also provides a process for the preparation of a compound of the formula I , which process comprises reacting a compound of the formula XI EMI14.1 wherein Q1 is a leaving group with a compound of formula XII EMI15.1 wherein the variables are as defined in formula I , and thereafter if desired or necessary converting a group R2, Rll or R12 in the thus formed compound to another group R2, R11 or R12 respectively as necessary converting R6 to other R6 and optionally forming a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the resultant compound of the formula I . The leaving group Q1is a group readily displaceable by a nucleophile. Suitable examples of Q are hydroxy, halogen such as chloro and bromo and acyloxy such as C14 alkoxycarbonyloxy or C14 hydrocarbyloxy such as pentachlorophenoxy. If the leaving group is hydroxy, then the reaction is preferably carried out in an inert non hydroxylic solvent, such as benzene, toluene, dichloromethane diethyl ether in the presence of a dehydrating catalyst, such as a carbodiimide, for example dicylohexylcarbodiimide. The reaction may be carried out at a non extreme temperature such as 10 to 100or, for example 0 to 800C. If the leaving group is a halide, then the reaction is preferably carried out at a non extreme temperature in an inert non hydroxylic solvent, such as benzene, toluene or diethyl ether. It is also preferably carried out in the presence of an acid acceptor, such as an organic base, in particular a tertiary amine, such as triethylamine, pyridine or picoline, some of which can also function as the solvent. Alternatively, the acid acceptor can be inorganic, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate or potassium carbonate. If the leaving group is acyloxy, then the reaction is preferably carried out in substantially the same manner as if the leaving group were hydroxy. Suitable examples of acyloxy leaving groups include C14 alkanoyloxy, mesyloxy, tosyloxy and triflate. If the leaving group is C14 alkoxycarbonyloxy, then the reaction is preferably carried out in an inert solvent, such as methylenechloride, at a non extreme temperature in the presence of an acid acceptor, such as triethylamine. If the leaving group is activated hydrocarbyloxy then the reaction is preferably carried out in an inert polar solvent, such as dimethylformamide. It is also preferred that the activated hydrocarbyloxy is a pentyachlorophenyl ester and that the reaction is carried out at ambient temperature. Preferably Qlis hydroxy, chloro or, in particular, C1 4 alkoxycarbonyloxy, such as ethoxycarbonyloxy. The skilled man will appreciate that the choice or necessity of conversion of groups R11 and or R12 to other groups R11 and or R12 will be dictated by the nature and position of substituents R1, R2, R11 andR12. It will be apparent that compounds of the formula I containing an Rll or R12 group which is convertible to another R11 or R12 group are useful novel intermediates. By way of example of such conversions, the compounds of the formula I wherein R11 or R12 is a nitro group may be prepared via nitration. For the preparation of the compounds of the formula I whereinR11 or R12 is an amino group, the reduction of a corresponding intermediate wherein R11 or R12 is a nitro group, may be employed. The reduction of the intermediates wherein Rll orR12 is a nitro group may be effected with reagents known to be suitable for reducing nitroanisole to aminoanisole. In general howwever, it is more convenient to prepare a compound of the formula I wherein R11 orR12 is an amino group from the corresponding C1 7 acylamino acid or its reactive derivative, and to deacylate the compound of the formula I so formed. Those compounds of the invention wherein R11 orR12 is a C17 acylamino group may be prepared from the corresponding intermediate wherein R11 or R12 is an amino group by reaction with an acylating derivative, such as previously described as a suitable acylating derivative, e.g. of the acid of the formula XI . The reaction may proceed as described for the reaction of the compounds of the formula XI and XII . For an Rll Rl2 formamido group acylation may be effected with the free acid. This invention thus also provides an optional process for the preparation of a compound of the formula I wherein R11 or R12 is an amino group which process comprises the deacylation of a corresponding intermediate wherein Rll or R12 is a C17 acylamino group. Generally the hydrolysis reaction may be effected by treatment with a base such as an alkali metal hydroxide. Also a compound of the formula I wherein R11 orR12 is halogen may be prepared by a conventional halogenation of the corresponding intermediate wherein the said R11 or R12 is hydrogen. It will be appreciated that, R6, when optionally substituted benzyl as hereinbefore defined, may be replaced by another group R6. Such R6 benzyl may be removed for example when R11 or R12 is not halogen by conventional transition metal catalysed hydrogenolysis to give compounds of the formula XIII EMI18.1 wherein the variable groups are as defined in formula 1 . This invention also provides an optional procrss step in the preparation of a compound of the formula 1 which comprises the reaction of a corresponding compound of the formula XIII as hereinbefore defined with a QR RR wherein compound 26 ein is as defined in forniua I and Q2is a group or atom readily displaced by a nucleophi e, and optionally forming a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the resulting compound of the formula I . Suitable values for Q2include C1, Br, I, OS02CH3 or OSO2C6H4pCH3 Favoured values for Q include C1, Br and I. 2 The reaction may be carried out under conventional alkylation conditions for example in an inert solvent such as dimethylformamide in the presence of an acid acceptor such as potassium carbonate. Generally the reaction is carried out at a non extreme temperature such as at ambient or at a slightly elevated temperature. R6 interconversion in the compound of the formula XII before coupling with the compound of the formula XI or its derivative is preferred. Such interconversions are effected conveniently under the above conditions. It is desirable to protect the amine function with a group readily removable by acidolysis such as a C 7 alkanoyl group before R6 interconversion. The acid addition salts of compounds of the formula I may be prepared in entirely conventional manner by reacting a compound of the formula I in base form with the chosen acid. T e quaternary alllnlonium sails of ll e compounds of the formula I may be prepared in conventional manner for such sa ts, such as by rcac5on of the chosen conipound of the formula I with a compoundR8Y as defined. This reaction is suitably carried out in an appropriate solvent such as acetone or methanol The nitrogen atom of the heterocyclic side chain ray also form an N oxide to give an internal N oxide salt of the compound of the formula I . The N oxides may be prepared in conventional manner such as by reaction of the chosen compound of the formula I with an organic peracid, such as m chloroperbenzoic acid.This reaction is suitably carried out at below ambient temperature in an organic solvent, preferably a cb1orinaed hydrocarbon. It will be realised that in the compound of the formula I the CO NH linkage may have an a or ss orientation with respect to the ring of the bicyclic moiety to which it is attached A mixture of a and B isomers of the compound of the formula I may be synthesised non stereospecifically and the desired isomer separated conventionally therefrom eg by chromatography or alternatively the a and ss isomer may if desired be synthesised from the corresponding a or ss form of the compound of the formula XII Synthesis from the corresponding a or ss isomer of the compound of the formula XII is in general preferred. The a or ss form of the compound of the formula XII may if desired be prepared by known stereospecific processes, such as those leading to the a or ss isomers of the compound of the formula XII depicted in the Schemes and described in the Descriptions hereinafter. Scheme 1EMI21.1 Remainder of ring system omitted for elarity Compounds of formula XI wherein R1 is C16 alkoxy or C16 alkylthio are known or prepared by analogy with known compounds. When R1 and R2 together are methylenedioxy or ethylenedioxy formation of the ethylenedioxy bridge in acids of formula XI may be carried out by heating an acid of formula XIV with dibromoethane in the presence of an inorganic base such as potassium hydroxide or potassium carbonate using ethanol water as the solvent.EMI22.1 Compounds of the formula XIV are known compounds or prepared by analogy with known compounds.

All the compounds of the formula I may be used in the treatment of emesis. Examples of compounds of the formula I which are of particular interest for their CNS activity, in particular interest for their CNS activity, in particular anti pyschotic activity, are those of formulae IV and IX . Compounds of the formulae IV and IX also have a low level of side effects such as extra pyramidal effects .

Normally orally administrable compositions are preferred. The invention further provides a method of treatment of maladies in mammals including humans comprising the administration of an effective amount of a compound of the formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The effective amount will depend in the usual way on a number of factors such as the nature and severity of the malady to be treated, and the actual compound used. The compositions of this invention will most suitably be presented as unit dose compositions containing from 1 to 100 mg, more usually from 2.5 to 50 mg, for example from 5 to 25 mg, such as 7.5, 10.0, 12.5 or 15 mg.Such compositions will normally be taken from 1 to 6 times daily, for example 3 or 4 times daily so that the total amount of active agent administered is within the range 2.5 to 200 mg.

PIARMACOLLX ICAL DATA The results in the following table are an illustration of the anti psychotic activity of the present compounds as shown by Inhibition of Apormorphine Induced ClimbinS in the Mouse, a standard test. Inhibition of apomorphine induced climbing in the mouse The test is based on that described by Protais, P., Constantin, J. and Schwartz J.C. 1976 , Psychopharmacology, 50, 1 6. When mice are given a dose of 1 mg kg apomorphine and then placed in an enclosed environment, such as an inverted wire cage, they are seen to climb around the walls. This behavioural phenomenon is thought to be a consequence of the stimulation of post snaptic Dopamine D.A. receptors in the nucleus accumbens. Inhibition of apomorphine induced climbing is therefore indicative of post synaptic D.A. receptor blockade in the accumbens. Groups of 10 male CDl mice, weighing 25 30 g were pretreated orally with either graded doses of the test compound or vehicle, at 30 minutes betore the subcutaneous administration of a sub maximal dose of apomorphine 1 mg kg . Immediately after the apomorphine injection the mice were placed in wire climbing cages and each animal was scored for climbing behavour at 10 and 20 minutes post apomorphine as follows Four paws on cage floor 0 Fore paws on cage wall 1 Four paws on cage wall 2 The total score was calculated for each group of mice and expressed as a percentage inhibition of climbing. inhibition 100 Total score for test compound x 100 Total score for apomorphine control EDSO s and fiducial limits were calculated according to the method of Litchfield and Wilcoxon, the ED50 being the dose that produced a 50 inhibition of apomorphineinduced climbing.
