# Aqueous polyurethane polyolefin compositions.

## Abstract
Method of making a stable aqueous dispersion of polymeric material comprising A producing an NCO terminated polyurethane pre polymer in the presence of inert liquid polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monomer material, B dispersing the product from A in water, C chain extending the prepolymer in the resulting aqueous dispersion, and D subjecting the aqueous dispersion from C to vinyl addition polymerization conditions to polymerize said monomer material in situ, the weight ratio of chain extended polyurethane to said monomer mate rial being about 9 1 to about 1 9., the resulting aqueous dispersions, and their use for making films, sheets and other products.
