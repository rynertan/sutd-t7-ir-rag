# Dual frequency acoustic fluid flow method and apparatus.

## Abstract
An acoustic fluid flow meter determines the flow velocity or volumetric flow from a measurement of the phase shift of acoustic signals propagated upstream and downstream along an acoustic path 12 in the fluid. High resolution measurements of the phase difference of transmitted and received signals represent the fractional wavelength which exceeds the integral number of waves along the acoustic path 12 . The low resolution determination of the integral and fractional number of waves for each direction is made by measuring the fractional phase shift A
