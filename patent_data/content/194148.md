# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR DETECTING COLOURED REGIONS, AND METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR SORTING ARTICLES THEREBY

## Abstract
A method of colour detection, in which electrical signals derived from two quantities, preferably orthogonal quantities, for example R L and B L are digitised. A time shift is applied to the signals, either before or after digitisation, and a differ ence signal is formed between each original signal, and its time shifted counterpart. The difference signals are then used as a key to a lookup table, to provide an output only when speci fied combinations of the two difference signals are encoun tered.
