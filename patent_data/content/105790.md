# CONSTANT PRESSURE RELIEF VALVE FOR AN AIR CONTROL VALVE

## Abstract
A constant pressure relief valve 10 for an air control valve maintains the pressure in a secondary air system below a predetermined value. A diaphragm 18 divides the valve housing 12 into two chambers 24 and 28 wherein the first chamber 24 contains the inlet orifice 22 controlled by a valve member 20 and an exhaust orifice 16 . The second chamber 28 contains a reference pressure and a valve bias spring 32 cooperating together to provide the constant pressure. Due to back pressures at the exhaust orifice 16 , the lift of valve member 20 is increased to increase flow through the relief valve 10 maintaining the constant relief pressure.
