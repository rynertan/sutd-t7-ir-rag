# Method and system for controlling output voltage of pulse width modulation inverter.

## Abstract
A pulse width modulation inverter is controlled by the use of the fundamental wave voltage E₁ of the inverter output as a feedback quantity, the fundamental wave voltage E₁ being obtained as the product of a function g K
