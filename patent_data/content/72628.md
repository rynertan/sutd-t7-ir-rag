# Electrically coalescing multi component liquid mixtures.

## Abstract
In an improved process for electrically coalescing water in oil emulsions in an AC electrical field at least one insulated electrode 66 is used having a dielectric constant which is at least about 3 and having a hydrophobic surface in contact with the emulsion. This results in faster coalescense of the emulsion than can be obtained with insulated electrodes having a dielectric constant, even if the electrode emulsion interface were to be hydrophobic. Formation of spongy emulsion and decomposition or the oil phase under the high voltages required for rapid coalescense is minimized and even eliminated.
