# Process for manufacturing a structural reinforcing member.

## Abstract
A process for manufacturing a structural reinforcing member is characterized in that a fibre body 1 comprising a plurality of threads 3 made of reinforcing fibre is impre gnated with a hardenable material 4 and is introduced into a drawing die 5 having a desired sectional shape so as to be formed into a drawn body 1 having a predetermined sectional shape, whereupon a tape 7 is coiled therearound so as to cover the same and the drawn fibre body 1 is subjected to a hardening treatment. The reinforcing mem bers can be used, for example, for reinforcing concrete.
