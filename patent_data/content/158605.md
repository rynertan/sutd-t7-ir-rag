# A stop start device for controlling the operation of an internal combustion engine of a vehicle provided with an automatic transmission.

## Abstract
The device comprises sensors 1 4 for providing elec trical signals indicative of the speed of the vehicle, the speed of rotation of the engine, the position of the accelerator pedal and the position of the brake pedal. An electronic monitoring and control unit 10 connected to these sensors 1 4 , activates actuator devices 11 arranged to turn off the engine when, for a period of time of predetermined duration, the speed of rotation of the engine is less than a first predetermined value, the speed of the vehicle is less than a threshold value, and the accelerator pedal is released. This monitoring and control unit 10 deactivates the actuator means 11 and activates the electric starter motor 16 when the signals provided by the sensors 1 4 indicate that the speed of rotation of the engine is lower than a second predetermined value, less than the first, and the accelerator pedal or the brake pedal is depressed.
