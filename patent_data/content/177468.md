# A method for manufacturing powder filled tubular welding electrodes and a device for performing the method.

## Abstract
A method for manufacturing powder filled tubular weld ing electrodes made from a continuously fed metallic gutter 16 in which the powder is introduced through a powder conveyor 17 opening in the gutter, which conveyor via a filling conduit 19 arranged inside the gutter will transfer the powder past a welding station 23 for welding the longitu dinal edges 25 of the gutter which is formed to a tube 21 . The purpose of the invention is to provide a method and a device for manufacturing powder filled tubular welding electrodes without the powder being damaged when it passes the welding station and that the filling of a tube is made under controlled conditions thus that the tube is completely filled concurrently with its feeding through the welding station. This has been solved thereby that a pressurized gas is introduced in the filling conduit 19 for accelerated transport of the powder through the conduit, and that the pressurized gas is evacuated through an evacuation duct 31 provided in the tube 21 the inlet 30 of said duct governing the feeding of the powder, therein that the inlet at too big a powder volume is blocked by the powder, whereupon a counter pressure will be achieved in the filling conduit causing the powder feed to be reduced or complete ly prevented.
