## Description
LIQUID SAMPLING SYSTEM This invention concerns a method and apparatus for agitating a fluid flowing through a pipe in order to render it homogeneous. It is particularly, but by no means exclusively, useful in the oil industry. In the oil industry, crude oil flowing through a pipeline is often metered, for example for the purpose of determining the royalty that has to be paid to the government of the country from which the oil has been taken. As crude oil nearly always contains a considerable amount of water, it is important that the water content be accurately determined so that the royalties to be paid can be adjusted so that no royalty is paid on the water content. Unfortunately, determining the water content accurately is difficult because when crude oil flows in a horizontal pipe much of the water in it tends to settle to the bottom of the pipe. Thus, if samples to be analysed are taken from the centre of the pipe, the analysis tends to yield too low a value for the water content of the oil in the pipe as a whole. Known equipment for overcoming this problem is shown diagrammatically in Figure 1. This equipment is the subject of BritishPatent Application No. 2030963. In this case a portion of the oil flowing through the pipe 1 is withdrawn from it by means of a pump 2 and then injected back into the pipe in the form of a high velocity jet 3, which enters at the bottom of the pipe. This jet 3 has to be very powerful to create sufficient turbulence for the water and oil in the pipe to be rendered homogeneous so that truly representative samples can be taken. We have now performed tests on a Perspex model simulating the apparatus described in British Patent Application No. 2030963 at theNational Engineering Laboratory, East Kilbride, Scotland, and as a result we have discovered that the liquid from the jet 3 described the flowpath shown in Figure 2. In effect the powerful stream of liquid emerging from the jet punches a hole through the water layer 4 and atomises the water immediately in front of the jet and closely adjacent to it. This atomised water is carried with the stream 5 across the pipe, where the stream impinges on the opposite portion of the wall.This impingement causes most of the energy of this stream to be expended in local turbulence, so that although two eddies 5 are formed, which circulate back towards the pipe bottom to give twin cell rotation, by the time that they have reached the pipe bottom they have lost most of their momentum. Although the streams 5 pick up large globules of water from the bottom of the pipe, they do not have sufficient energy to atomise these globules, which therefore tend to be circulated around the pipe in un dispersed form, unless the incoming stream from the jet 3 is very powerful. Such globules quickly sink to the bottom of the pipe so that the samples taken by the downstream sample probe are not, in fact, accurately representative of the contents of the pipe. Recent research has highlighted a further problem with this method, in that it has now been discovered that the water content of the oil tends not to be constant, but rather to rise and fall suddenly. When the water content is large, an even larger amount of water left is undispersed by the jet 3. Comparative tests carried out at the same time at the NationalEngineering Laboratory have established that the method and apparatus of the present invention give what in practice is perfect homogenisation of the pipe contents, using a jet of much lower energy than in the apparatus described above. According to the invention there is provided a method of agitating a material flowing along a pipe of circular cross section, which material comprises first and second phases of different densities, so that the denser phase tends to accumulate in lower portions of the pipe, c which method includes injecting fluid into the pipe, characterised in that one or more streams of fluid are injected into the pipe through a jet or jets in such a way that 1 the stream or streams impinge on the heavier phase so that substantially the whole of the heavier phase is intermingled with neighbouring portions of the lighter phase, and li that a system of twin cell rotation is imposed on substantially the whole of the pipe contents, so that the mixture of phases formed in step 1 is vigorously circulated around the pipe and becomes intermixed with any further un mixed lighter phase. The material flowing through the pipe is preferably oil containing a small proportion of water which forms the heavier phase. In one preferred method, the stream or streams of fluid are injected into the pipe in the region of the pipe where the heavier phase congregates, so as to impinge on a flow divider on or close to the wall of the pipe to assist the division of the stream to establish the twincell rotation. There is also provided apparatus for carrying out this method, comprising a length of pipe, and a jet or jets within the pipe, characterised in that the jet or jets are arranged in such a way that Q a stream or streams of fluid from it or them impinges on the heavier phase so that substantially the whole of the heavier phase is intermingled with neighbouring portions of the lighter phase and g a system of twin cell rotation is imposed on substantially the whole of the pipe contents, so that the mixture of phases formed in step chics is circulated vigorously around the pipe and becomes intermixed with any further unmixed lighter phase. We further provide apparatus forinsertion into a pipe characterised by a tube provided with a jet or jets and a flow divider mounted on the tube to divide a stream or streams of fluid from the jet or jets into two separate eddies. Where a flow divider is used, this is preferably in the form of a sole plate which may for example be in the shape of a cuspate prismoid or a triangular prism. The flow divider may be attached by supports to the jet or jets so that it can easily be installed in and withdrawn from the pipe. If more than one jet is provided, these are preferably disposed symmetrically on either side of the flow divider. The jet or jets are directed towards the flow divider so that the stream from the jet or jets splits into two approximately equal streams then impinge on the wall of the pipe to establish the twin cell rotation effect. alsoThe divided stream impinges on the heavier phase at high velocity and so causes it to be dispersed into the neighbouring portions of the lighter phase, and this dispersion is then circulated around the pipe by the twin cell rotation effect. The accumulation of the heavier phase flowing along the pipe is divided into two streams by the flow divider before it is impinged on by the fluid from the jets. Lateral jets may optionally also be present. In another possible variation of the method according to the invention, at least two streams of fluid are injected into the pipe through jets in such a way that the streams impinge on one another, on the accumulation of said heavier phase, and on a portion of the pipe wall close to said accumulation, so that they first disperse said accumulation locally and then cause the above mentioned twin cell rotation effect. We also provide apparatus for carrying out this variation, characterised by at least two jets arranged within a length of pipe so that streams from the jets impinge on one another, on the accumulation of said heavier phase, and on a portion of the pipe wall close to said accumulation, so that they first disperse said accumulation locally and then cause the above mentioned twin cell rotation effect. The jets are preferably arranged symmetrically with reference to the accumulation of the seccnd phase. The jets may be mounted on retractable tubes. The dispersion may be accomplished with or without the aid of a venturi. If a venturi is used, the jet is preferably located at the bottom of the pipe pointing upwards and the venturi is inside the pipe close to the bottom and co axial with the jet, in the case of an oil water mixture as described above. Thus, the accumulated water is drawn into the venturi and ejected upwards with the stream towards the top portion of the pipe wall there the stream impinges on the wall and divides, thus together with the suction of the venturi causing the twin celled rotation. The venturi may or may not be provided with a diffuser. In the case of the above mentioned oil water mixture, and if no venturi is used, the jet may be located at the top of the tube either just inside the tube or within the tube wall and arranged to direct a stream of fluid vertically downwards to impinge on the accumulation of water in the bottom of the pipe and also on the pipe wall, thereby dispersing the water locally and also giving rise to the twin cell rotation which distributes the initial dispersion around the remainder of the cross section of the tube. This embodiment is likely to be fully satisfactory only where there is a relatively small proportion of water in the oil. Preferably though, the jet is located on a tube which projects into the pipe and is arranged to inject the fluid stream vertically downwards from a point just above the region of the pipe in which the water tends.to accumulate. As a variation on this preferred construction, the injection tube may include two or more jets in the same plane arranged at various angles.A particularly preferred form has one jet directed vertically downward and a pair of lateral jets directed substantially horizontally across the pipe and at right angles to its longitudinal axis. In another particularly preferred form two streams of fluid are injected into the pipe in opposite directions so that each acts on the accumulation of the second phase, before giving rise to the twincelled rotation. These streams may be in two or more pairs and the pairs may be injected into the pipe at different levels so that each pair contributes to the twin cell rotation. Preferably, the closer each pair to the centre of the pipe, the lower the energy with which the stream is injected. According to an especially preferred method, two or more pairs of streams are injected into the pipe, he two streams of each pair being injected in opposite directions along the same chord of the pipe cross section, the pairs of streams being spaced apart and parallel to one another. The injection tube is preferably retractable to allow a cleaning pig to be passed along the pipe. In all of the above cases, the fluid to be injected into the pipe through the jet is preferably obtained by drawing off some of the fluid flowing through the pipe itself. Fluid agitating apparatus according to the invention will now be described by way of example and with reference to Figures 3 to 7 of the accompanying drawings, each of which is a schematic cross section of a different embodiment. Figure 8 shows n perspective a flow divider in the form of a cuspate prismoid, Figure 9 shows this in cross section installed in a pipe, Figures 10, 11 and 12 show in cross section three embodiments where the eddies are produced by the mutual impingerr3nt of fluid streams from separate jets. All the embodiments relate to oil containing water and flowing in a horizontal pipe, the water being denser tending to accumulate in the pipe bottom.Similar parts are indicated by similar reference numerals in all of these drawings. In the embodiment shown in Figure 3, the jet 10 is located at the top of the pipe 1 and is arranged to eject a stream of fluid vertically downwards, as shown by the arrow 11. This stream which is composed of fluid drawn off from the pipe 1 impinges on the concentration of water 12 in the pipe bottom, and then on the pipe wall, which causes the formation of two contra rotating eddies 13 which circulate back towards the jet 10, where they are deflected back downwards again by the stream emerging from the jet. As the stream has not yet impinged on the wall when it meets the accumulated water in the pipe bottom, it has lost relatively little of its original kinetic energy and so can disperse the accumulation without the jet having to be as powerful as in the apparatus described in the above mentioned earlier Patent Application.Owing to the twin cell rotation that is caused when the stream impinges on the pipe bottom and divides, this dispersed material is quickly distributed by the eddies 13 around the remainder of the interior of the pipe. The embodiment shown in Figure 4 is similar, except that the jet 10 is located at the distal end of a retractable injection tube 14 which is mounted vertically within the pipe. This embodiment is an improvemeqnt over the one shown in Figure 3 because the stream has lost less of its original kinetic energy when it encounters the accumulation of water 12 in the pipe bottom. The embodiments shown in Figures 3 and 4 are fully effective only when the oil contains a relatively small percentage of water, because otherwise the single jet is unable to act on the whole of the water concentration and disperse it completely within the neighbouring oil. For example, we have found that both of these embodiments perform satisfactorily when the oil contains 4 of water, but we would expect the efficiency to decrease if the percentage were very much higher than this. The embodiment shown in Figure 5 is a further improvement.It is similar to that shown in Figure 4, but includes two further jets 10a, each of which is located just above the main jet 10 and is directed horizontally across the pipe at right angles to its longitudinal axis.The streams 15 from these lateral jets 10a reinforce the twin cell rotation caused by the impingement of the stream from the main jet on the pipe bottom. Comparative experiments at the National EngineeringLaboratory using a test rig have shown that with this embodiment the three jets having a total power of 15 watts can provide entirely satisfactory homogenisation of a 4 water 96 kerosene mixture in a 100 mm pipe at a flowrate of 3 litre second, whereas even a 40 watt jet cannot achieve satisfactory homogenisation using the apparatus shown in PatentApplication No. 2030963. The embodiment shown in Figure 5a is similar to that shown inFigure 5 except that it includes two supplementary lateral jets 10b inclined in an upward direction. Figure 5b is similar to Figure 5 except that the lateral jets 10a are inclined upwardly and are not horizontal. The embodiment shown in Figure 6 is a variant of that shown in Figure 5, except that the three jets have been replaced by two opposed jets 10c inclined at an angle to the vertical. The embodiment shown in Figure 7 includes a ventjri tube 16.In this case the jet 10 is located in the pipe bottom and the venturi tube 16 is just inside the pipe and is coaxial with the jet. The venturi tube draws in fluid from the bottom of the pipe, including any accumulated water, as shown by the arrows 17, and ejects this at high speed as part of the stream 18 towards the top of the pipe, where the stream impinges on the wall and contributes to the twin cell rotation which gives rise to the two contra rotating eddies 19. The venturi tube 16 preferably has no diffuser as in this case the stream 18 tends to spread out less before it impinges on the wall. Figure 9 shows the flow divider 100, which is shown on a larger scale in Figure 8, installed in a pipe 300 in which a two phase fluid in this case a liquid is flowing with the top edge of the flow divider intersecting and perpendicular to the axis of a jet 200 which is at the end of a retractable tube 14a projecting into the pipe 1 so that the jet is directed downwardly towards an accumulation of the second phase 500 of the liquid. The stream from the jet 200 is divided into two streams by the flow divider 100 and these impinge on and break up the accumulation 500. The resulting eddies 400 then continue around the pipe cross section in opposite directions to give the twin cell rotation effect, carrying the dispersed second phase with them, and mixing it with the remainder of the pipe contents.The flow divider 100 is preferably connected to the bottom of the tube 14a so that it can be retracted with it. Figure 10 shows how a similar effect is achieved by a pair of jets 201, mounted on retractable tubes and disposed symmetrically with reference to the accumulation of the second phase 500. In cases where a high proportion of the heavier phase is present e.g. 20 or more this embodiment will operate more efficiently if the jets 201 are moved higher up the tube, e.g. to the positions shown in broken lines at 201 . They may be moved up to the centre line of the tube, or beyond it in cases where a very high proportion e.g. 50 or more of the heavier phase is present. Figure 11 shows a pair of jets 202 mounted on retractable tubes which eject streams of fluid in opposite directions along a chord of the pipe cross section from a point close to the pipe wall. The streams circulate around the wall until they meet and form eddies 402, rotating in opposite directions around the pipe ci rcumference. Figure 12 shows a variation of this embodi nent 502 for use where the proportion of the heavier phase is high, e.g. in the region of 50 . In this case there are three pairs of jets 202, 202 , 20211, which ensure that none of the heavier phase escapes being blended with neighbouring portions of the lighter phase. The diameters of the jet pairs are progressively decreased towards the centre of the pipe.The number of pairs of jets can be varied to suit the particular application In these embodiments the material injected through the jets is preferably a portion of the contents of the pipe previously withdrawn from the pipe, but can be, or can include, a different material e.g.a radioactive tracer which is thereby thoroughly mixed with the contents of the pipe.
