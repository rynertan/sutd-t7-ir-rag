# Method of measuring radioactivity.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a method of measuring radioactivity which is suitable for discriminating between surface and internal contaminations of a body. The radioactivity of a subject is measured to obtain a γ ray energy spectrum of radioactivity signals obtained thereby, and a discrimination between surface and internal contamination of the subject is performed on the basis of the ratio between a photoelectric effect component and a Compton scattered component of the γ ray energy spec trum. According to the present invention, surface and internal contaminations can be clearly identified.
