# Drive mechanism for a scroll type fluid displacement apparatus.

## Abstract
A scroll type fluid displacement apparatus 1 is dis closed. The apparatus includes a housing 10 having a front end plate 11 and a scroll housing 12 . A fixed warp extends into an operative interior area of the housing from an inner end surface of an end plate portion of the scroll housing. An orbiting scroll member 20 has an end plate 201 from which an orbiting wrap 202 extends, and a tubular member 203 axially projecting from the end surface of the end plate into the operative interior area of the housing. The tubular member 203 has a hollow interior 21 . A drive shaft 15 is rotatably supported by the front end plate and a crank pin 152 extends from its inner end surface. The crank pin 152 is rotatably carried within the hollow interior 21 of the tubular member 203 through a bearing assembly 22, 23 to thereby rotatably support the orbiting scroll 20 .
