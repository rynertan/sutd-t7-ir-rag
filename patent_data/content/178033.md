# NEUTRAL PAPER AND PROCESS FOR ITS MANUFACTURE

## Abstract
A neutral or alkaline paper having highly uniform tone, higher bursting point and greater opacity is described. The manufacturing process consists primarily in neutralizing to a pH of 7 or more and acid mixture of fibers, sizing agents and aluminium sulphate with alkaline earth metal oxides or hydro xides and their derivates. The mixture so neutralized allows the use of calcium carbonate as a filler in the stock, resulting in greater ingredient retention and a lesser amount of fines in the water, this residual water being a clear water that can be recycled. The substitution of clays by calcium carbonate reduces or eliminates machinery wear. Implementation of the process does not require using additional, new or different manufacturing equipment while it implies an immediate reduction in costs.
