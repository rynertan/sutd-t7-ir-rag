## Description
Epicyclic transmission with steplessly variable speed control, having tapered planet wheels of dual conicity The present invention relates to an epicyclic transmission with steplessly variable speed control including a housing a drive shaft and a driven shaft extending within the housing a planet carrier within the housing mounted on the drive shaft for rotation by the latter a plurality of planet wheels in the form of tapered rollers which are supported for rotation by the planet carrier by means of rolling bearings and are spaced angularly from one another about the axis of rotation of the planet carrier, the planet wheels having a larger frusto conical portion and a smaller frusto conical portion adjacent the larger base of the larger frusto conical portion, and the radially external generatrices of the larger frusto conical portions extending substantially parallel to the axis of rotation of the planet carrier a governing annulus locked for rotation with the housing and having its internal surface in rolling contact with the surfaces of the larger frusto conical portions of the tapered planet wheels adjustment means for axial displacement of the governing annulus along the larger conical portions of the tapered planet wheels a driven annulus rotatable coaxially with the planet carrier and having an internal conical surface complementary to the surfaces of the smaller frusto conical portions of the tapered planet wheels, the driven annulus rotating the driven shaft, and means for pressing together into pressure contact the surfaces of the smaller frusto conical portions of the tapered planet gears and the complementary conical surface of the driven annulus, and the surfaces of the larger frusto conical portions of the tapered planet wheels and the internal surface of the governing annulus. Transmissions of the type defined above are described and illustrated,for example, in US A2,328,536, US A 2,343,840, US A 2,342,071 and US A 3,677,1O9. These transmissions, generally referred to as Traction Drive transmissions, are based on the elasto hydrodynamic theory of lubrication and, for transmitting power, take advantage of the shearing strength of a lubricant film between the surf aces of the components of the transmission that are in rolling contact. In fact, when subjected to high working pressures, the lubricant film undergoes a vitreous transition to behave like solid, thus retaining a constant thickness which is also due to the elastic yield of the material forming the members that are in rolling contact, its shearing strength enabling transmission of the drive forces from the drive member to the driven member whilst ensuring complete separation between the surface irregularities of these members. The main problem with these transmissions is the difficulty of transmitting high power when the size and bulk are reduced, at necessary for application to the field of motor traction.These difficulties arise mainly from the magnitude of the normal forces acting on the surfaces of the members in rolling contact. In order to ensure transmission of the high torques involved, these forces assume the value of several tons and impose considerable loads on the support bearings of the tapered planet wheels, with the result that the working life of the transmission is by no means satisfactory. These forces also cause deformation of the members in rolling contact which, combined with tolerances of size and assembly , jeopardises the concentricity of the epicyclic unit to the point where the tapered planet wheels operate on kinematically differing contact radii, causing variability in the transmission ratio, overloading of the contact areas, slippage and wear. Given the heavy loads involved, it is therefore essential that geometric causes of wear are eliminated as far as possible, whilst ensuring correct and constant lubrication of the contact areas in order to avoid an interruption of the lubricant film and any resultant direct contact between the metal parts. A further drawback in the transmissions of the prior art lies in the complexity and inadequacy of the adjustment means for axial displacement of the governing annulus, and the devices which together hold the planet wheels in pressure contact with the driven annulus, and the planet wheels with the govern ing annulus that is to say, a lack of operational reliability. The general object of the present invention is to avoid the drawbacks of the prior art and, in particular, to produce a transmission with a s teplessly variable speed control, of the type mentioned initially, which is capable of transmitting high rates of power and torque with reduced size and bulk, and which proves operationally reliable with a long working life, so that it may be applied efficiently in the field of motor traction. The invention achieves its aim by means of a transmission with steplessly variable speed control of the type defined above, the main characteristic of which lies in the fact that it further includes a freely rotatable sun wheel in the form of a sleeve which is coaxial with the planet carrier and has two axially spaced bearing surfaces in rolling contact with two complementary bearing surfaces of each of the tapered planet wheels. Due to this characteristic, each of the tapered planet wheels has two linear fatigue bearing areas by virtue of which there is an appreciable reduction in the loads to which the bearings are subjected when they support the rotating tapered planet wheels, leavingthem with the sole function of bearing the tilting torque arising from the tangential forces in the drive contacts of the planet wheels. These linear bearing areas enable the hertzian contact pressures to be contained within limits which ensure an acceptable fatigue life for the transmission. According to the invention, the contact areas between the two bearing surfaces of the sun wheel sleeve and the two complementary bearing surfaces of each tapered planet wheel lie on common conical generatrices which converge substantially towards the point of intersection between the rotation axes of the tapered planet wheels and the rotation axis of the planetcarrier. The rolling contact between the tapered planet wheels and the sun wheel sleeve thus remains kinematically correct and free from dissipative spin phenomena. According to another aspect of the invention, the means for pressing together into pressure contact the smaller frusto conical portions of the tapered planet wheels and the complementary conical surface of the driven annulus, and the larger frusto conical portions of the tapered planet wheels and the internal surface of the governing annulus, as well as the adjustment means for axial displacement of the governing annulus along the larger conical section of the tapered planet wheels, are formed by oleodynamic actuators. This characteristic facilitates automatic control of the transmission in a simple and functional manner using, for example, an electronic control unit, so that the transmission itself may be adapted instantly to the operating requirements both insofar as this relates to variations in the transmission ratio between the drive shaft and the driven shaft, and to the variation in contact pressure between the tapered planet wheels and the driven annulus and governing annulus, respectively, as a function of the values of the torques to be transmitted and the rate of rotation of the transmission. Further characteristics of the transmission according to the invention lie in the ability of the components of the transmission itself to self centre under load, thereby eliminating any operational difficulties arising from operating tolerances and any play which might develop in assembly or under load, and in a lubrication system which can continuously supply a liquid lubricant under pressure to the contact areas between the tapered planet wheels and the governing annulus, the driven annulus, and the sun wheel sleeve respectively, and to thebiarings which support the rotating members of the transmission during rotation. The invention will now be described with reference to the attached drawings which, purely by way of non limiting example, illustrate a preferred embodiment of the invention. In the drawings Figure 1 is an axial section taken along the line I I in Figure 2, showing a transmission according to the invention Figure 2 is a transverse section taken along the line Il Il of Figure 1, and Figure 3 is a diagrammatic view of a detail ofFigure 1. Referring to Figures 1 and 2, a substantially cylindrical housing 10 has a tubular projection 12 at one end and is closed by a plate 14 at the opposite end. A hollow support body 16 is fixed to the internal face of plate 14, having a tubular projection 18 at Xts inner end which is coaxial with the tubular projection 12. A hollow input shaft 20 extends through the housing 10 and is arranged to be driven by the shaft of a motor vehicle engine. The input shaft 20 is supported for rotation on one side by the tubular projection 12 and on the opposite side by the tubular projection 18, by means of roller bearings indicated 24, 26 respectively. A drive shaft 28 surrounds coaxially, and in a rotatable manner, the central part of input shaft 20. That end of the drive shaft 28 which faces the tubular projection 12 is connected with an axially sliding disc 30 associated with a hydraulicallyoperated friction clutch 32 of known type, which has the function of coupling or uncoupling the drive shaft 28 and the input shaft 20 during rotation. A planet carrier 34 is fitted by means of a splined coupling 36 onto the other end of the drive shaft 28. The planet carrier 34 is formed by a rear disc 38 and a front disc 40 interconnected by means of a septa 42 which are angularly equidistant with respect to the drive shaft 28. In the areas between the connecting septa 42, the rear and front discs 38,40 are provided with two sets of three mutually aligned radial notches 38a, 40a. The end of a pin 44 is slidingly engaged in each corresponding pair of notches 38a, 40a and on it is mounted a freely rotatable planet wheel in the form of a tapered roller 46.As shown in detail in Figure 3, the axes of the pins 44, that is, the rotation axes of the three tapered planet wheels 46, converge towards the rear of the housing 10 at a point C lying on the rotation axis of the planet carrier 34, or the shafts 20,28. Each tapered planet wheel 46 is hollow in order to minimize the effect of centrifugal force during operation, and has a larger frusto conical portion 48, a smaller frusto conical portion 50 formed by an annular projection adjacent the larger base of the larger frusto conical portion 48, and two terminal tangs with cylindrical internal surfaces and conical external surfaces at the front 54 and rear 52 respectively. The larger frusto conical portion 48 converges towards the front of the housing 10, whilst the smaller frusto conical portion 50 and the conical surfaces of the terminal tangs 52, 54 converge towards the rear of the housing 10. More particularly, as shown in Figure 3, the conical surfaces of the terminal tangs 52, 54 have common generatrices converging towards the point C, towards which, as stated previously, the rotation axes of the tapered planet wheels 40 converge. Each planet wheel 46 is mounted rotatably on its respective pins 44 by a pair of radial roller bearings between the internal surfaces of the terminal tangs 52, 54 and the corresponding parts of the pins 44. The radially external generatrices of the larger frusto conical portions 48 of the planet wheels 46 are arranged on an imaginary common cylindrical surface concentric with the axis of rotation of the planet carrier 34. The surfaces of these larger frustoconical portions 48 are in rolling contact with the internal surface of a governing annulus 58 mounted to slide axially, but not rotate, relative to the housing 10. In fact, in correspondence with its front face, the governing annulus 58 diametrally opposed radial pins 60 with two rollers 62 fitted to the external ends which engage in corresponding axial guide slots 64 formed in the side wall of a hollow cylindrical element 6.The element 66 is, in turn, connected with radial clearance to the side wall of the hollow body 16 by a pair of pins 68 which are diametrally opposed to each other and angularly staggered at 900 relative to the pins 60. The governing annulus 50 thus floats relative to the three planet wheels 46 and is therefore self centring. The axial displacement of the governing annulus 58, for reasons specified previously in the specification, is effected by a set of three axial oleodynamic actuators 70 which are angularly equidistant from one another, each comprising a cylinder 72 formed integrally with the element 66 within which is slidable a piston 74 carrying a rod 76. The external end of each rod 76 has a substantially spherical surface which bears against a shallcwrecess with a complementary spherical surface 78 formed in the rear major face of the govern ing annulus 58. Three axial return members 80, which are angularly equidistant from one another and staggered angularly relative to the oleodynamic actuators 70, operate on the Opposite major face of the annulus 58.Each of the return members 80 comprises a socket element 82, the bottom of which has a projection with a substantially spherical surface 86 which, by means of a helical spring 88,presses against a corresponding recess with a complementary spherical surface 84 in the annulus 58. The smaller frusto conical portions 50 of the three tapered planet wheels 46 bear against a complementary conical internal surface 90 of a driven annulus 92 which is formed integrally with a wheel 94 which rotates coaxially with the drive shaft 28. The wheel 94 is supported for rotation by the tubular projection 18 of the body 16 by means of a taper roller bearing 96, and is fitted with an externallytoothed crown wheel 98 which meshes with a cylindrical gear wheel 100 carried by a driven shaft 102 parallel to the input shaft 20.The internal end of the driven shaft 102 is supported for rotation by a tubular projection 104 of the body 16 with the interpositioning of a rolling bearing 106, whilst its external end passes through an opening in the rear plate 14, which supports it for rotation by means of a rolling bearing 108, in order to transmit the drive to a differential unit of the motor vehicle. The contact pressure between the smaller frusto conical portions 50 of the planet wheels 46 and the conical surface 90 of the driven annulus 92, and between larger frusto conical portions 48 of the planet wheels 46 and the internal surface of the governing annulus 58, is supplied by an oleodynamic actuator, generally indicated 112. This actuator 112 is formed by an annular cup shaped element 114 carried on the housing 10 coaxial with the drive shaft 28 and with its cavity facing the front disc 40 of the planet carrier 34. An annular piston 116 is mounted in the cavity of the element 114 for axial sealed sliding under the action of a Belleville washer 118 which tends to press it axially towards the planet carrier 34.The annular piston 116 has a hub 120 which partly surrounds the drive shaft 28 and against which bears a freely rotatable sun wheel in the form of a sleeve 122 coaxial with the drive shaft 28. Between the hub 120 of the piston 116 and the sun wheel sleeve 122 are placed a radial ball bearing 124 an an axial bearing 126. The axial bearing 126 is formed by two rings of straight rollers 128 placed between an internal centre plate 130 and a first external bearing block 132 and a second external bearing block 134, respectively, which rest against two annular shoulders of the hub 120 and the sun wheel sleeve 122 respectively. According to a variant illustrated in Figure 4, the bearing 96 and the bear ing 124, 126 are preferably replaced by a pair of axially orientable roller bearings 150. The sun wheel sleeve 122 has two external bearing surfaces 136, 138 in correspondence with its ends, which are in rolling contact with the external surfaces of the terminal tangs 52, 54 of the three tapered planet wheels 46. The bearing surfaces 136, 138 are conical surfaces whose generatrices are coincident with those of the conical surfaces of the tangs 52, 54 and therefore converge , as shown in Figure 3, towards the point C defined above. The above described shape of the sun wheel sleeve 122 facilitates a considerable reduction in the loads which bear on the bearings 56 of the tapered planet wheels 46, enabling an appreciable reduction in the hertzian pressures in the areas of contact with the planet wheels 46, and the elimination of any dissipative spin phenomena. The operation of the transmission described above is epicyclic. Indeed, whentherotation of the input shaft 20 is transmitted through the friction clutch 32 to the drive shaft 28 and thence to the planet carrier 34, the tapered planet wheels 46 are rotated so that the larger frusto conical portions 48 roll on the governing annulus 58 and the external surfaces of the tangs 52, 54 roll on the sun wheel sleeve 122, transmitting the motion to the driven annulus 92 and thence to the driven shaft 102. The axial position of the governing annulus 58 determines whether the driven shaft 102 rotates in the same direction as the drive shaft 28, in the opposite direction, or not at all.Indeed, when the planet carrier 34 is considered as an input element and the governing annulus 92 as an output element, the transmission described above facilitates a range of ratios T r r l where r 1 Rc2 Rc1 R52, in which Rsl, Rs2 and s c s2 sl RCl, RC2 are the radii shown in Figure 3. When r is greater than 1, the driven shaft 102 rotates in the same direction as the drive shaft 28, whilst when r is less than 1 it rotates in the opposite direction. When r is equal to 1 the driven shaft is stationary. The operation of the piston 116 of the oleodynamic actuator 112 is such that the value of the contact pressure between the tapered planet wheels 46 and the driven annulus 92 varies as a function of the values of the torque to be transmitted. The intervention of the actuator 112 may be controlled automatically, using an electronic control unit, for example, so that it can compensate for the overloading which occurs in the contact area between the rotating members of the transmission as a result of centrifugal force. In order to ensure that the transmission operates with kinematic precision, and to eliminate the negative effects that arise from operational tolerances, clearances in assembly, and yielding under load, the epicylcic unit of the transmission according to the invention is completely self centring. The self centringisrna3e sible by the above described assembly of the governing annulus 58 and the planet wheels 46 in relation to the planet carrier 38, and by the particular curvature of the mutually contacting surfaces of the planet wheels 46 with the governing annulus 58 and the driven annulus 92.In fact, these surfaces are slightly convex, as are the bearing surfaces between the actuators 70,80 and the governing annulus 58, between the sun wheel sleeve 22 and the hub support bearings 120, and between the piston 116 and the element 114 of the oleodynamic actuator 112. Moreover, when the operation of the transmission is based on the elastohydrodynamic theory of lubrication, utilizing the shearing strength of the lubricant film between the surfaces of rolling contact, it is essential to ensure that lubrication is correct and constant. The transmission according to the invention has a special lubrication system capable of ensuring that lubricant is supplied constantly to the contact area at the correct pressures under all operational conditions, without having to ensure a large quantity of lubricating oil within the housing 10, by avoiding even partial immersion of the rotating parts of the transmission in the lubricant and the resultant increase in dissipative losses.This system includes, among other things, an inlet union 140 for the lubricant connected by a telescopic pipe 142, to an annular pipeline 144 which is fitted to the front face of the governing annulus 58 and has a plurality of holes in its wall through which the lubricant is sprayed into the contact areas between the planet wheels 46 and the governing annulus 58. The lubricant is supplied by another inlet union 146 to the cavity of the input shaft 20 and thence, by a series of radial openings not illustrated in the wall of the shaft 20, to the contact areas between the planet wheels 46 and the driven annulus 92. The same lubricant is used both to lubricate thebearings 124, 134, and as an operating fluid for the hydraulic actuators 70 ffiich displace the governing annulus 58, as well as an operating fluid for the oleodynamic actuator 112.In the latter case, the lubricant is fed into the cavity of the element 114 by an inlet union 148.
