# Electro optical device.

## Abstract
An electro optical device for reading an information disc comprises an optical system 22 which is movable relative to the disc and which is controllably supported by elongate supporting means 24, 25 , the system being driven by means of at least one electro magnetic actuator 26 , The supporting means are pretensioned in the longitu dinal direction by first and second magnetic pretensioning means 26B, 27A B which cooperate with each other via an air gap, enabling the use of very flexible supporting means, for example wires which have a low resistance to bending and a very low mass.
