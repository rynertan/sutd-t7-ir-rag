# Optical resolution of DL cysteine.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a method of optical resolution of DL cysteine by forming diastereoisomers with optically active mandelic acid, followed by preferential crystallisation. The method facilitates commercial production of optically active cysteine, particularly L cysteine which is in great demand.
