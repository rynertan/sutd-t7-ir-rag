# Heating apparatus.

## Abstract
Heating apparatus includes four tungsten halogen lamps 5 mounted beneath a layer 11 of glass ceramic, which forms the top surface of a cooking hob. An electronic temperature sensing device 12 , which is preferably a ther mistor or thermocouple, is arranged so as to be in contact with, or closely adjacent to, the undersurface of the layer 11 , so that the device 12 produces a signal 13 indicative of the operating temperature of the undersurface of the lay er 11 . The signal 13 is compared with a reference signal indicative of the maximum operating temperature of the glass ceramic and the lamps 5 are de energised when the signal 13 exceeds the reference signal.

## Description
HEATING APPARATUS This invention relates to heating apparatus and in particular, though not exclusively, to such apparatus of the kind described in our co pending British Application No.8320717, incorporating one or more sources of infra red radiation. Heating apparatus of this kind consists of, in one example, a shallow tray member containing insulative material and supporting four infra red emitting, tungsten halogen lamps.The tray member, along with a number of similar members, is mounted beneath a layer of ceramic, so as to form a cooking hob. It is necessary to ensure that the operating temperature of the undersurface of the glass ceramic layer does not exceed a maximum value of approximately 7000C. To this end, the heating apparatus described in the afore mentioned application includes a thermal limiter disposed in any suitable position beneath the glass ceramic. The limiter consists of a metallic rod, which is adjusted to trip a microswitch when the maximum operating temperature of the glass ceramic is reached, so as to disconnect the power supply to the infra red lamps. However, this known type of thermal limiter may need to be minutely adjusted to avoid nuisance tripping of the microswitch and, in any case, integration of the temperature over the heated area of the glass ceramic may not be essential to implement sufficiently accurate monitoring of the operating temperature thereof. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide heating apparatus incorporating one or more sources of infra red radiation, and including a substantially improved thermal limiter to the kind employed heretofore. According to the invention, there is provided heating apparatus including at least one source of infra red radiation disposed below a layer of glass ceramic, characterised in that said apparatus includes temperature sensing means for monitoring the operating temperature of said layer and for producing an electrical signal substantially indicative of said operating temperature, and circuit means for de energising said at least one source of infra red radiation when said signal indicates an operating temperature substantially at or above a predetermined maximum value thereof. Preferably, the temperature sensing means comprises a thermister or thermocouple, which is preferably in contact with, or closely adjacent to, the undersurface of the layer of glass ceramic. It may also be preferable to shield the temperature sensing means from incident infra red radiation, emitted from the source or sources, by means such as a reflective coating or a ceramic fibre housing around the temperature sensing means. The invention will now be further described by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein Figure 1 shows a sectional view of one embodiment of the present invention, Figure 2 shows a simplified circuit arrangement for use in conjunction with the heating apparatus shown in Figure 1, and Figures 3 and 4 show alternative embodiments of the invention. Referring to Figure 1, a generally circular tray 1, preferably formed from metal, has disposed therewithin, on the base thereof, a layer 2 of a suitable insulative material. The tray 1 has two extending flanges, 3 and 4, arranged on opposite sides of the rim thereof, which support respectively each end of a number of sources of infra reradiation, 5 being shown at 5. In a preferred example, four sources are arranged across the circular area of the tray 1. Each source 5 of infra red radiation comprises a tungsten halogen lamp including a tungsten filament 7 supported within a quartz envelope 6, as described in co pending EuropeanApplication No. 84301636.1, in the name of THORN EMI plc. Each lamp has moulded ceramic end caps, 8 and 9, which each enclose a pinch seal not shown with an electrical lead connected to the respective end of the filament sealed therein, the lead being welded to an appropriate electrical connector. A moulding 10 of ceramic fibre material is disposed above the tray 1 and press fitted around the ends of each source 7 to provide a suitable packing therefor. The tray 1 is urged upwardly, by a resiliently mounted support plate not shown , towards the undersurface of a layer 11 of glass ceramic, which forms the top surface of a cooking hob. However, to protect the layer 11 of glass ceramic, a maximum operating temperature thereof, of approximately 7000C, Should be enforced. The present invention therefore provides an electronic temperature sensing device 12, which is preferably a thermocouple or alternatively a thermistor. The device is preferably arranged so as to be in contact with, or closely adjacent to, the undersurface of the glass ceramic layer 11, so that the device 12 produces a signal indicative of the operating temperature of the undersurface of the layer 11. As shown in Figure 2, a signal 13 produced by the device 12 is amplified in a differential manner by amplifier 14 and output 15, which is termperature compensated using a diode 16, is fed to a comparator 17, which compares the temperature compensated output 15 with an adjustable reference signal 18, which is indicative of the maximum operating temperature of the glass ceramic layer 11. If the signal 13 produced by the device 12 exceeds the reference signal 18, then the comparator 17 generates a signal 19, which actuates a triac 20, so as to disconnect the power supply to the filament of each of the lamps, thereby de energising the lamps. To improve substantially the accuracy with which device 12 monitors the operating temperature of the undersurface of the layer 11, it may be preferable to shield the device 12 from incident infra red radiation emitted from the lamps. This may be implemented by accommodating the device within either a housing having a reflective coating thereon, such as a metallic oxide coating, or a housing fabricated from a ceramic fibre material. Figures 3 and 4, which show two alternative embodiments of the present invention illustrate two other possible positions within the heating apparatus for the device 12, so that it is capable of monitoring the operating temperature of the glass ceramic layer 11. Figure 3 shows the device 12 accommodated within a hollow 17 formed in the layer 2 of insulative material below the infra red lamp, and Figure 4 shows the device 12 disposed within the ceramic fibre moulding 10, so that the device is shielded from incident infra red radiation, whilst maintaining thermal contact with the undersurface of the layer 11. It can therefore be envisaged that the present invention provides heating apparatus, incorporating one or more sources of infra red radiation and including a substantially more reliable, compact and accurate thermal limiter than that utilised heretofore.
