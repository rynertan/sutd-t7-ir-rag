# Stabilisation of photochromic compounds, and the use of stabilised photochromic compounds.

## Abstract
The stabilisation of selected photochromic com pounds, selected from certain fulgides and fulgimides, is made possible by associating with such compounds a clay mineral having an expanding crystal lattice, which can stabilize a selected photochromic compound in a higher energy coloured form. The stabilized photochromic compound may be one included in a coating composi tion, such as a paper coating composition, or may con stitute or be incorporated in a filler for a papermaking furnish or for a plastics material. The stabilizer serves to maintain the photochromic compound in its higher energy coloured state or one of its higher energy co loured states, thereby tending to prevent deterioration of colour as the photochromic compound converts to an uncoloured or weakly coloured lower energy state.
