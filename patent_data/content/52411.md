# Method of recrystallization of phosmet, pet collar including recrystallized phosmet and method of making the collar.

## Abstract
The chemical phosmet O,O dimethyl S phthalimido methyl phosphorodithioate is recrystallized from a hydro carbon solvent alcohol mixture in a weight ratio of from about 1 2.5 to 1 1 and is thereby freed of its offensive odor. It is incorporated into a plastics material in an amount of about 5 18 , based on the total, for extrusion or moulding into a pet collar. In use, crystals of the phosmet are transferred from the surface of the collar to the pet and kill ectoparasites. A preferred packaging for such a collar is made of spun bonded polyolefine since this avoids recurrence of odor which might otherwise occur after long storage.
