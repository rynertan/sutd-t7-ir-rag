# Thermotropic polyesteramides.

## Abstract
Melt processable fibre forming polyesteramides com prising residues of one or more aminophenols selected from p aminophenol and p N methylaminophenol and residues of one or more dicarboxylic acids characterised in that the polyesteramide contains a balance of linear difunctional residues and dissymmetric difunctional residues derived from either the aminophenols or the acids chosen to give a product which melts below its decomposition temperature and exhibits optical anisotropy in the melt.
