# Method for converting a fluid tracing system into an electrical tracing system.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for converting a thermally insu lated steam heat tracing system 10 into an electrical heat tracing system. The conversion method includes the steps of removing the thermal insulation at spaced apart locations 18 , opening up the interconnected tubes of the steam tracing sys tem, and inserting elongate electrical heating elements 20 into the tubes. Preferably, a gel forming liquid is introduced into the elongate tubes and is converted into a gel within the tubes.
