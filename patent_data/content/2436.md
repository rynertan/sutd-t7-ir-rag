# A centrifugal clutch with an overspeed relief valve and clutch modulation.

## Abstract
A fluid pressure operated clutch 10 which transmits torque from an engine output shaft 12 to a transmission input shaft, including a rotatable flywheel 14 connected to the output shaft, an adapter 20 connected to the flywheel 14 for rotation with the flywheel 14 , the adapter 20 having a first annular plate 22 with a fluid passage 60 near the inner periphery of the plate 22 , and a centrifugal piston 52 which defines with the adapter 20 a fluid chamber 64 supporting a rotatable torus of hydraulic fluid. The piston 52 has a second annular plate 84 , slideable with respect to the first plate 22 , an a second fluid passage 69 near the outer periphery of the second plate. The first and second plates, at their inner peripheries, provide a controlled clearance 60 to vary the rate of hydraulic fluid into the first fluid chamber 64 as the second plate slides. A centrifugal relief valve 94 is connected to the piston 52 and has a conical valve member removably seated on an outlet of the valve to drain fluid from the chamber 64 through the second passage 69 and the outlet when engine overspeed occurs. A clutch pack 46 of friction plates responds to movement of the piston 52 to engage and disengage the clutch 10 .
