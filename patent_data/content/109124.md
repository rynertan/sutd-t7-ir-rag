## Description
Cell culture microcarriers based on the polymerization product of an aromatic monovinyl hydrocarbonThe invention relates to cell culture microcarriers having a diameter in the range of from 60 to 300 Pm, the carrier material consisting of the polymerization product of an aromatic monovinyl hydrocarbon provided with negatively or positively charged groups, and to a method of growing anchorage dependent cells in microcarrier culture with the aid of these cell culture microcarriers.Cell culture microcarriers of the above mentioned type are described, among other places, in two articles by Johansson and Nielsen in Develop.biol. Standard 46, pp. 125 129 and pp. 131 136 S. Karger, Basel 1980 .The carrier material consists of polystyrene beads having a particle size in the range of 160 to 300 Pm. The density of the beads is 1,05 g cm3. They carry 2 to 14x1014 negatively charged groups per cm2 of surface area.Although these beads offer several advantages over commonly applied cell culture microcarriers based on polydextran in that they display a lower degree of swelling, have a narrow particle size distribution and good mechanical properties, cell attachment at the beginning of the cultivation process is not at all found to be satisfactory. One remedy recomF mended to that end is to refrain from stir ring in the early stages of the cultivation process. As a result, however, the beads will precipitate,which also does not contribute to obtaining a satisfactory and uniform distribution of the cells over the beads.The present invention provides cell culture carriers which do not display the above mentioned disadvantages or only to a greatly reduced extent. The invention consists in that with cell culture carriers of the known type mentioned in the opening paragraph the polymerization product substantially consists of cross linked polyvinyl toluene.It is particularly surprising that upon using this polymer the above problems are hardly met if at all. It is of importance that the polyvinyl toluene should contain a cross linking agent. It is preferred that use should be made of a cross linking agent in an amount which is in the range of 0,1 to 7 by weight, calculated on the polyvinyl toluene. Use of a cross linking agent in an amount of less than 0,1 by weight will cause the beads to swell unduly strongly and disintegrate in a solvent upon introducing ionic groslrc containing substituents. Use of a cross linking agent in an amount higher than 7 by weight is generally detrimental to the mechanical properties in that a relatively brittle polymer is obtained.Preference is generally given to polyvinyl toluene beads containing a cross linking agent in an amount of 0,1 to 4 by weight, preferably 0,5 to 2,5 by weight.As cross linking agents a variety of compounds may be employed. It is desirable that as such use should be made of polyvinyl compounds, preferably divinyl and trivinyl, aromatic, aliphatic and heterocyclic compounds. As examples may be mentioned divinyl toluene, divinyl xylene, divinyl naphthalene, divinyl pyridine, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, ethylene glycol diacrylate, divinyl ethyl benzene, divinyl sulphone, divinyl ketone, divinyl sulphide, diallyl fumarate, diallyl maleate, acrylic esters such as divinyl acrylates, divinyl fumarates, divinyl oxalates and the corresponding trivinyl compounds such as trivinyl benzene, trivinyl citrate, trivinyl aconitate and trivinyl phosphates.In actual practice preference is given to the relatively inexpensive divinyl benzene.The polymerization product according to the invention may, in addition to a cross linking agent, contain other vinyl monomers.As a rule, the monovinyl monomers mixture may contain monomers other than vinyl toluene in a maximum amount of 10 by weight. Examples of suitable monovinyl monomers are styrene, o , m and p ethyl styrene, tert.butyl styrene, vinyl naphthalene, vinyl anthracene and homologous compounds. Of the vinyl toluene all three isomers, viz. o , m and p vinyl toluene qualify for use in the preparation of the cell culture microcarriers according to the invention.The preparation of the cell culture microcarriers according to the invention may be effected by various well known prior art methods. The preparation may be carried out by block polymerization, but preference is given to emulsion polymerization or suspension polymerization. The polymerization is carried out in the presence of catalysts initiating the formation of free radicals. As exaw2les may be mentioned azobisisobutyronitrile and oxidizing catalysts such as sodium persulphate or potassium persulphate, but preference is given to oxygen or organic peroxides such as benzoyl peroxide, lauryl peroxide, and tert.alkyl peroxide. It is preferred that the catalyst should be used in an amount ranging between about 0,5 to 5 parts per 100 parts of monomer.Providing positively or negatively charged groups also may be effected by well known prior art methods.Positively charged groups may be provided for instance as indicated inUnited States Patent Specification 2 591 574. In the process described in it the polymr is first haloalkylated. This step involves introducing into the polymer a plurality of bromcalkyl or chloroalkyl groups, that is groups of the general formula CnH2nX wherein n is an integer of a value from one to four and X is a chlorine or bromine atom. As haloalkylating agent may be used a mixture of an aldehyde and a halogen acid e.g., paraformaldehyde and hydrochloric acid or a dihalo alkane and aFriedel Crafts catalyst e.g., ethylene dichloride and alnniniun chloride , or a haloether and a Friedel Crafts catalyst.An activated microcarrier also may be obtained by copolymerization of, say, p chloromethyl styrene.It is preferred that the resulting haloalkylated copolymer should subsequently be treated with a swelling agent e.g., by washing with dioxane and then reacted with a solution of a primary and or secondary amine, resulting in an insoluble, cross linked, polymeric amine salt, which may be converted into the free amine by washing with sodium hydroxide.Alternatively, use may be made of a tertiary amine, which results in obtaining a strongly basic polymeric amine. As solvent for the amine preferably an agent is chosen which also acts as a swelling agent for the polymer. An example of a suitable solvent is dioxane. The e amines are used in the form of the free base. The amines which are preferred are those which are primary or secondary and in which the amino group or groups are attached to a hydrocarbon group. Optionally, said last mentioned group may carry a substituent, provided that it does not interfere with the amination reaction of the haloalkylated polymer.Of course, also mixtures of various primary and or secondary amines may be employed. The hydrocarbon portion of the amine may be aromatic, aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, araliphatic, or alkyl aromatic. As examples of amines which are suitable in this invention may be mentioned methylamine, dimethylamine, n butyiamine, isobutylamine, dibutylamines, aniline, benzidine, o , m , and p toluidines, xylidines, or and ss naph thylamine, naphthalene diamine 5, benzylamine, dibenzylamine, phenylene diamine, benzyl aniline, benzyl ethylamine, methyl aniline, cyclohexyl amine, dicyclohexylamine, diethylene triamine, triethylene tetramine, tetraethylene pentamine, and propylene diamiine. An example of a tertiary amine is trimethylamine. Strongly basic polymers may be obtained by reacting a feebly basic polymer with methyl iodide or methyl chloride or by reaction with a tertiary amine. A man skilled in the art will have no difficulty in choosing such conditions for a given polymer system of a particular particle size as will result in optimum cell growth per unit of polymer weight.It has been found that cell culture carriers having optimum properties are generally obtained if the amount of positively charged groups per unit of area is in the range of from 0,1 to 5 meq g.The cell culture carriers may be negatively charged in accordance with, for instance, the method described in United States Patent Specification 2 500 149. In order to obtain products of as light as a colour as possible it is recanxbended that the sulphonation should be carried out in the presence of phosphorus trichloride. In that case, too, the proportion of negatively charged groups to be provided depends on the given polymer system and the particle size of the carrier material.Favourable results are generally obtained using 2K1014 to 20x1014 2 negative charges per cm of particle area. The invention will be further described in the following examples, which are of course not to be construed as limiting the scape of the present invention. Eanple IInto a 20 litre, three necked flask equipped with a thermocowle, a stirrer, a reflux condenser and a dropping funnel there were successively introduced an aqueous 5 solution of polymethacrylic acid in water neutralized with NaZI to a pE of 7,7, 66,8 g of tricalcium phosphate, 7,2 g of sodium chloride, 11520 ml of water, and 17,2 ml of 2N NaOH.The flask was flushed with nitrogen, followed by stirring 380 revolutions per minute . A solution of 118 g of technical divinyl benzene, 55 by weight and 3132 g of vinyl toluene a mixture of 30 para and 70 ortho isaners was added over a period of 30 minutes. To remove residual stabilizers the monomers were washed with a dilute sodium hydroxide solution. Subsequently, 30 g of benzoyl peroxide were added. The e stir ring speed was increased to 420 revolutions per minute and the reaction mixture heated to 800C, at which temperature it was kept for 5 hours.After cooling to room temperature the solid copolymer beads were isolated by filtration. After washing with hydrochloric acid and water they were extracted with petroleum ether, dried to the air and then dried for one hour at 800C. The beads were screened to obtain 967 g having a diameter of 90 to 150 Pm 30 and 1900 g having a diameter of 150 to 250 Pm 58 . Example IIInto a 2 litre, three necked flask equipped with a thermometer, a stirrer and a reflux condenser there were introduced 200 g of the copolymer beads of Example I. Subsequently, there were added 500 ml of monochloromethyl ether and 700 ml of trichloroethylene, after which the mixture was allowed to stand for one hour to permit the beads to swell.The reaction mixture was heated to 600C with an oil bath, after which a solution of 100 ml of trichloroethylene and 14 g of tintetrachloride was added, followed by stirring for 10 minutes. The reaction mixture was filtered, followed by washing the beads with a 10 water containing solution of dioxane until no longer any chloride was detected in the wash liquor. Upon analysis it was found that the beads contained 1,37 meq of chlorine per gramme. Eartle IIIThe procedure of Example II was repeated in such a way that the mixture was only allowed to react for 5 minutes. Upon analysis the beads were found to contain 1,17 meq of chlorine per gramne. Example Iv The procedure of Example II was repeated in such a way that the reaction time was reduced to 3 minutes. Upon analysis the beads were found to contain 0,8 meq of chlorine per gramme. Example VThe same procedure was used as in Example II, except that as solvents 400 ml of trichloroetnylene and 400 ml of petroleum ether boiling point 800 1000C were used. The reaction time at room temperature was 3 minutes. Upon analysis the beads were found to contain 0,5 meq of chlorine per gramme. Example VIInto a 500ml, three necked fitted with a thermometer, a stirrer and a reflux condenser there were introduced 20 g of swollen chloromethylated beads washed with dioxane of Example VI. Subsequently, 200 ml of diethylamine were added and the contents of the flask were heated on an oil bath bath temperature 800C for 16 hours.Next, 200 ml of water were slowly added, after which the beads were filtered off and washed with water and alcohol until the wash water was free of amine. The beads were feebly basic and had a capacity of 0,72 meg g. Example VIIThe same procedure was used as in Example VI, with the exception that there was added a solution of 160 ml of dioxane and 40 ml of trimethyl amine. After a reaction time of 16 hours at 350C strongly basic beads were obtained having a capacity of 0,72 meq per gramme. Example VIIIThe same procedure was used as in Example VII, except that it was started with 50 g of chloromethylated beads having a chlorine content of 2,41 meq per gramme. There were added 400 ml of dioxane and 100 ml of trimethylamine.The strongly basic beads had a capacity of 2,05 meq per gramme. Example Ix Into a 500ml, three necked fitted with a thermometer, a stirrer and a reflux condenser there were introduced 1l0 g of copolymer beads of Example I having a diameter of 150 to 250 Pm. There were added 220 ml of sulphuric acid 96 , after which the reaction mixture was subjected to continued stirring for 10 minutes at 230C.The beads were successively poured onto ice, removed by filtration and washed with demineralized water until the wash water was free of sul phate. Upon analysis it was found that the beads contained 2,66x10 4 meq groups of sulphonic acid per gramme, which corresponds to 5x1014 groups per cm2. E caitle XThe procedure of Example IX was repeated in such a way that the mixture was allowed to react for 4 minutes at 400C. Upon analysis it was found that the beads contained 6,75x10 meq of sulphonic acid groups per gramme, which corresponds to 12,6 x 104 groups per cm2. Example XIThis example demonstrates that the cell culture microcarriers of the present invention in a number of cell cultures match up to or even excel the well known cell culture microcarriers based on cross linked dextran.After washing the cell culture microcarriers with distilled water and flushing with a phosphate buffered salt solution PBS a suspension in P4S of 10 by weight of cell culture microcarriers which had stood for 2 hours at room temperature was sterilized in an autoclave for 30 minutes at 120 C. Prior to use the cell culture microcarriers were washed 3 times with the culture medium. Subsequently, about 100 ml of the cell culture microcarriers to be cultivated were introduced into 250 ml spinner bottles equipped with a magnetically driven Teflon coated stirring bar. The concentration of the cell culture microcarriers in it was 6 cm2 ml. The stirring speed was about 20 60 r.p.m.Cell cultivation was carried out in an appropriate culture medium using cells of the BHK 21 C13 type Baby Hamster Kidney Cells or human fibroblasts of the or or S lSA7 type foreskin fibroblast or MJB type human skin fibro blasts, passage 11 17, provided by G.C. Beverstock of the Instituut voorMenselijke Genetica at Leiden . For the growth of the aboveementioned BHK cells use was made of whgle s Spinner medium of the RIV Rijksinstituut voor de Volksgezondheid supplemented with 10 foetal calf serum from the firm of Gibco and a solution containing per litre 3 x 10 7 M tbymidine 3 x 10 6 M hypoxanthine and 10 4 M non essential amino acids.The human fibroblasts were cultivated in MEM minimum essential medium supplemented with 10 foetal calf serum and a solution containing per litre 3 x 10 7 M thymidine, 3 x 10 6 M hypoxanthine and 10 M non essential amino acids. Cell attachment was determined by taking a 5 ml sample every 2, 4 and 24 hours following inoculation. Then sampling was repeated every 24 hours. The cells attached to the cell culture microcarriers in the samples were counted by using a modification of the method of Sanford et al., as described by Van Wezel in Tissue Culture,Methods and Applications, P.F. Kruse and M.R. Patterson eds , pp.372 377 Academic Press, New York .The preparation of the cell culture microcarriers was started from the beads with a diameter between 90 and 150 Pm of Example I. After chloromethylation and treatment with trimethylamine cell culture microcarriers were obtained having a capacity of 1,0, 1,4 and 1,8 meq per granite, respectively. For comparison use was made of dextran beads marketed by Pharmacia Fine Chemicals AB under the trade name Cytodex 1. They had a capacity of 1,5 meq per gramme.The table below shows the cultivation results expressed as numbers of cells per ml x 103, use being made of Baby Hamster Kidney Cells.
