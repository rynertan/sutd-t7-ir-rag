# An improved splinter prevention device in automatic cycle woodworking machines.

## Abstract
The device consists of a movable element provided with a splinter prevention block 30 able to protect material subjected to machining against the danger of it splintering in the region of the outgoing edge of the tool, and constituted by a carriage 53 56 movable two ways along the direction 5 in which the pieces P to be machined are infed. The said carriage has connected to it a tail piece 25 to which is secured a wooden block 30 that constitutes the splinter prevention means for the pieces to be machined, and this is able to rotate around a longitudinal axis 52 along which the said carriage traverses from a position away from the piece being machined to a position close thereto, the said carriage and the said tail piece being so controlled that the said splinter prevention block is automatically positioned for the period of time needed for machining, on each piece to be handled, in the region of the outgoing edge of the tool 7 with respect to the direction of rotation of this.
