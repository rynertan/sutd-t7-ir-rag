## Description
The present invention relates to a product comprising a fibrin specific antibody substantially devoid of fibrinogen cross reactivity coupled to tissue type plasminogen activator. The use of antibodies for passive immunization has been utilized for many years. Early attempts using this methodology usually involved the administration of antibodies specific for a disease agent, which were raised in another species and later administered to the recipient which was a member of a different species. This approach proved to be of limited value from the standpoint of effectiveness as well as from the perspective of adverse reactions by the host to the large quantities of foreign antibody protein which had to be administered to achieve significant therapeutic effect. As a consequence, the individual of the species receiving the passively administered antibodies would often develop an adverse reaction to these foreign proteins, resulting in what is commonly known as serum sickness. Another serious drawback to the early attempts at passive immunotherapy was the poor specificity, or selectivity, of the antibodies that were produced by the source species. Many times the species in which the antibody was produced recognized antigenic determinants and produced antibodies thereto which would react with non protective determinants on the pathogenic agent in the recipient species or, even worse, would cross react with the normal tissues of the recipient species. Additionally, because the percentage of antibodies which were therapeutically effective was often quite small compared to the total amount of antibody produced by the source species, and because there was no effective means of separating the useful antibodies from those which were not, the recipient species had to be exposed repeatedly to large quantities of antibody protein in order to receive a protective amount of the useful antibody. Often this repeated exposure of the recipient species to these large quantities of foreign antibody would cause the recipient s own immune system to attack these foreign proteins, resulting in greatly decreased therapeutic effectiveness and serum sickness. As a result of these complications, the use of passive immunotherapy in the past has been extremely limited. In recent years, interest in the use of passive immunotherapy has been restimulated by the development of monoclonal antibody technology. Because of the nature of this technology, it is now possible to produce antibodies to substances which in the past were not sufficiently immunogenic for purposes of polyclonal antibody production and actually select the antibody that has the desired therapeutic specificity. In addition, since these antibodies are produced by a single clone responding to stimulation by a single epitopic determinant, the high degree of site specific selectivity that can be achieved makes it conceivable that much lower concentrations of passively administered antibody may now be used. Early clinical investigators quickly realized the advantages of this technology and endeavored to utilize monoclonal antibodies which were specific for the site of disease in the host, but would not cross react with normal host tissue. This great specificity, in turn, enabled scientists to couple monoclonal antibodies to highly toxic drugs or radioactive substances which in the past could not effectively be utilized because of the toxic side effects to the host when the substances were administered systemically. However, a potential danger inherent in this approach to passive immunotherapy using monoclonal antibodies coupled to an active toxic substance, is that these active substances may become uncoupled from the monoclonal antibody and thus pose a toxic threat to the host. The method according to the present invention circumvents these earlier problems by coupling a relatively non toxic substance, the activator, to an antibody specific for the target site. Although in many instances highly effective drugs have been developed for treatment of various disease states, their toxic side effects at concentrations necessary to achieve therapeutic effectiveness often negates their usefulness. One specific problem of lack of selectivity relates, for example, to thrombolytic agents used to dissolve blood clots. Coronary arteriographic studies indicate that 90 95 of transmural myocardial infarctions are caused by coronary thrombosis DeWood, M. A. Currently, two activators are commercially available, streptokinase and urokinase. Both are indicated for the treatment of acute cardiovascular disease such as infarct, stroke, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, peripheral arterial occlusion, and other venous thromboses. Collectively, these diseases account for major health hazards and risks. Streptokinase and urokinase, however, have severe limitations. Neither has a high affinity for fibrin consequently, both activate circulating and fibrinbound plasminogen relatively indiscriminately. In addition, the plasmin formed in circulating blood is neutralized rather quickly and its efficacy lost for useful thrombolyses. Residual plasmin will degrade several clotting factor proteins, for example, fibrinogen, factor V and factor VIII, causing hemorrhagic potential. In addition, streptokinase is strongly antigenic and patients with high antibody titers respond inefficiently to treatment and cannot remain on continuous treatment. The recent availability of human tissue type plasminogen activator has somewhat improved the therapeutic prospects. Nevertheless, the issue of selectivity remains an important one. One way to avoid systemic exposure to highly active, non selective, and particularly toxic agents would be by selectively activating the agent at the target site where its therapeutic effect can be maximized. The fact that the drug can be selectively concentrated at the target site would require minimal exposure of the host to the active agent and diminution of side effects associated with systemic exposure. In order to provide a more selective means for administering drugs, the inventors have thus conceived and developed a product whereby antibodies which are specific for the site of disease in a host are bound to an activator. When these antibodies are administered to the host, they specifically bind to the disease target site having the epitope for which these antibodies are specific. The antibody bound activator then reacts with an inactive substance also present in the host and converts the inactive substance to an active substance which, because of its proximity to or affinity for the target site, reacts with the target site. This inactive substance may be exogenous or endogenous to the host system in which the target site is located. Thus, the present invention provides a product which can be used in a method for a host site specific activation of an inactive substance, which comprises The invention comprises powerful and selective complex thrombolytic products which have an increase in selectivity over prior art thrombolytic agents. These products are obtained by providing Pharmaceutical compositions comprising the products together with pharmacologically appropriate carriers are also included in this invention. Figure 1 shows the release of labeled peptides from fibrin Sepharose by a conjugate of urokinase and fibrin specific antibody , 2.5 hours o, 15 hours , urokinase myosin antibody conjugate , 2.5 hours , 15 hours , and unconjugated urokinase , 2.5 hours , 15 hours . Conjugated or unconjugated urokinase 100 ul containing the indicated amount of urokinase was incubated for 4 hours with 100 ul ¹²⁵I fibrin Sepharose, washed with 1 x 3 ml 0.1M Tris, 0.1M NaCl, 0.5 BSA, 0.5 Triton X100 and 3x3 ml TBSA, and incubated for 2.5 and 15 hours with purified plasminogen 120 mg l . Lysis was expressed as the quotient of released radioactivity and total radioactivity. Each point represents the mean standard deviation of three independent determinations. Figure 2 shows the release of labeled peptides from fibrin Sepharose during recirculation of a solution containing plasminogen 0.12 mg ml and fibrin specific antibody 64C5 in the presence o and absence of 3.5 mg ml fibrinogen. The experiment was repeated with a myosin specific antibody 3H3 in the presence and absence of fibrinogen. In each instance, the recirculating fluid contained 0.25 units of urokinase activity ml coupled to either of the antibodies. Each point represents the mean of three determinations with a standard deviation of less than 1.6 . In the method using the product according to the invention, an antibody bound to an activator and specific for an epitope or epitopes present on a target site in a host system is administered to the host system and allowed to bind to specific epitopes at the target site whereby the target is fibrin. The bound activator then activates an inactive substance which thereby becomes activated and reacts with or is absorbed by the target site. The inactive substance may be either exogenous or endogenous to the host system in which the target site is located. In other words, the target site is a target for both the specific antibody and the activated substance. For example, the target site may be a protein capable of being bound by the specific antibody and of being a substrate for the activated substance when the activated substance is a proteolytic enzyme. The antibodies which can be used in the present invention may be any antibodies which are specific for determinants on the target site. For example, Shouval Examples of other target sites and non target sites which can be differentiated using specific antibodies are listed in Table I. The target site, which has epitopes that allow the antibody of the invention to bind, may be any site for which it is deemed that initiation of therapy is appropriate. In the present invention it is the result of a dysfunction of a normal host system as, for example, the formation of a thrombus. The term causing the contact as used in the present invention is meant to encompass the exposure of the target site to the activator bound antibody which is essentially specific for the target site. The term epitope as used in this invention is meant to include any determinant responsible for specific interaction with an antibody molecule. Epitopic determinants usually consist of chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids or sugar side chains and have specific three dimensional structural characteristics as well as specific charge characteristics. The term target site denotes any region to which it is desirable to bind the activator bound site specific antibody. It is to be understood that the term bound as applied to the attachment of the activator to the target site specific antibody means that the activator and antibody are bound to each other in such a manner that the activator remains capable of activating the inactive substance and the antibody remains capable of reacting with the target site. The activator which is bound to the target site specific antibody is a substance or agent which will react with an inactive substance to convert the inactive substance into an active substance. The activator according to the present invention is tissue type plasminogen activator. The inactive substance as described in the invention may be either exogenous or endogenous to the host system. In either case, in the presence of the activator bound antibody which is present at the target site, the inactive substance is converted to an active substance which then reacts for example, therapeutically with the target site for the benefit of the host system. It is also possible for the exogenous inactive substance to be unmodified. In this situation, the exogenous substance may be, for example, a proenzyme which normally is not present in the host system and which, when reacted with the activator, is converted to an active enzyme which, in turn, reacts with substrate present at the target site. In another embodiment, it is possible for the inactive substance to be endogenous to the host system in which the target site is located and which, in the presence of the activator, is converted to an active form which reacts with, or is absorbed by, the target site. An example of an endogenous inactive substance would be a pro enzyme such as for example, plasminogen which, in the presence of the activator such as, urokinase is converted to the active enzyme plasmin which can then react with a target site containing fibrin. The antibodies which can be used in the invention should be specific for an epitope on the target site and essentially non reactive with epitopes of tissues not present at the target site. If polyclonal antibodies are used, it may be necessary to purify them using affinity chromatography to achieve the desired degree of target site specificity. For example, purification of essentially target site specific polyclonal antibody could be achieved by The specific concentrations of target site material bound to the carrier, and polyclonal antibody, as well as such parameters as incubation time for binding of polyclonal antibody and elution conditions, can be varied. For example, the target site specific polyclonal antibody can be absorbed to the target site bound to the carrier by incubating the polyclonal antibody and target site at 4 37 C for up to 24 hours. The absorbed polyclonal antibody can then be eluted from the carrier bound substance by such common techniques as use of an acidic solution, such as 0.1 1.0 M glycine HCl buffer at pH 2.0 5.0, or a chaotropic agent, such as 1.0 5.0 M potassium thiocyanate at pH 4.0 7.5. Those skilled in the art will know of many other suitable techniques for the purification of target site specific polyclonal antibodies, or will be able to ascertain such, using routine experimentation. Monoclonal antibodies, when used in the present invention, can be produced in various ways using techniques well understood by those having ordinary skill in the art and will not be repeated here. Details of these techniques are described in such books as The term couple as utilized in the specification and claims is meant to include broadly the firm attachment of the activator to the antibody. Such attachment may be covalent or noncovalent, although it is preferably covalent. The coupling of the two entities may be direct or, most commonly, by means of a coupling or conjugating agent. There are several intermolecular cross linking reagents which can be utilized see, for example, Means, G. E. and Feeney, R. E., It is also possible to produce a fused activator antibody protein wherein the activator is coupled to the antibody at the genetic level. For instance, an antibody activator molecule could be produced wherein the hybridoma secretes an antibody which has had its Fc portion replaced with a different protein which functions as the activator see, e.g., Neuberger, M. S. The conditions and concentrations useful for obtaining the antibody activator couples of the invention can be readily adjusted by those of skill in the art by reference to known literature or by no more than routine experimentation. The molar ratio of activator to antibody can vary from 1 1000 to 1000 1, more preferably 1 10 to 100 1, and most preferably 1 1 to 100 1. In the embodiment of the present invention, the thrombolysis of blood clots, the antibodies usable in preparing the products of this embodiment may be any antibodies which are fibrin specific and are substantially devoid of fibrinogen cross reactivity. For example, antibodies with that specificity have been described in Hui, K. Y. These peptides, which are only given herein as illustration and are not the only ones which can be used in this embodiment of the invention, contain 7 11 amino acid residues and are utilized in sensitization and or immunization, cell fusion, ascites production, selection of mixed hybridomas and or subcloning of hybridomas to produce polyclonal monospecific or monoclonal antibodies. The peptides, which contain fibrin specific sequences, are attached to an immunogenic protein through a connecting bridge, such as maleimidobenzoylated MB keyhole limpet hemocyanine KLH . Immunized animals or cells obtained therefrom can be used as a source to obtain monospecific antibodies followed by subsequent affinity chromatography using fibrinogen as a ligand, or may be fused to produce hybridomas to secrete antifibrin specific monoclonal antibodies with substantially no cross reactivity to fibrinogen. Generally, any antibody obtained by using these or other peptides as immunogens can be utilized for this embodiment. Among the preferred ones are monoclonal antibodies obtained from cell line 59D8 on deposit at the ATCC with Accession No. HB8546, cell line 64C5 on deposit at the ATCC with Accession No. HB8545, and cell line 55D10 on deposit at the ATCC with Accession No. HB8547. These lines were placed on deposit at the ATCC prior to April 23, 1984. Other antibodies of the desired specificity are obtained by using as immunogen the amino terminus of the alpha chain of fibrin, or by immunizing with fibrin and then selecting a subset by affinity chromatography using fibrinogen as a ligand. Coupled products of the overall invention can also be used as pharmaceutical compositions. For example, the coupled products of the invention can be formulated in appropriate pharmaceutical compositions by including activating amounts of the desired product together with pharmacologically appropriate carriers. Generally speaking, these carriers include aqueous or alcoholic aqueous solutions, emulsions or suspensions, including saline and buffered media. Parenteral vehicles include sodium chloride solution, Ringer s dextrose, dextrose and sodium chloride, lactated Ringer s or fixed oils. Intravenous vehicles include fluid and nutrient replenishers, electrolyte replenishers, such as those based on Ringer s dextrose, and the like. Preservatives and other additives can also be present, such as, for example, antimicrobials, antioxidants, chelating agents, inert gases, and the like. See, generally, The route of administration of pharmaceutical compositions prepared according to the method of the invention may be any of those commonly known to those of ordinary skill in the art. For therapy, including without limitation thrombolytic therapy, the coupled products of the invention can be administered to any patient in need of such therapy. The administration can be by any appropriate mode, including parenteral, intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, or, also appropriately, by direct infusion with a catheter, such as in intracoronary administration. The dosage and frequency of administration will depend on the age, sex and condition of the patient, concurrent administration of other drugs, counter indications and other parameters to be taken into account by the clinician. The exact dosage and frequency with which the coupled products of the invention would be administered when used as therapeutic compositions are known to those of ordinary skill in the art or are readily ascertainable with only minor experimentation. For example, when pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are used in therapy, the dosages and frequency of administration can be comparable to those used for the administration of the active substance, or of the activator itself in the prior art. Generally, however, the dosage will be from about 0.001 to 0.2 times the dosage normally utilized for the administration of the active substance by itself. The following reference example is for the purpose of illustrating the invention although it does not concern a claimed conjugate. Reduced urokinase was coupled to fibrin specific monoclonal antibody 64C5 via its intrinsic sulfhydryl groups utilizing N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithio propionate SPDP as a cross linking agent Carlsson, J. Unconjugated urokinase and its component subunits were separated from the urokinase antibody conjugate 125 I UK SS 64C5 by gel filtration on Sephacryl S 200 2.5 x 90 cm . Two radioactive fractions were clearly resolved. The first contained the antibody urokinase conjugate and was free of unconjugated urokinase. By SDS PAGE, its molecular size exceeded 150 KD and it proved to be radioactive on subsequent autoradiography, indicating that it contained the urokinase subunit. The incorporation of urokinase averaged one mole per 3 of antibody as determined by specific radioactivity of the urokinase subunit. Further evidence of the association of urokinase activity with antibody was obtained by affinity chromatography of the antibody urokinase conjugate on a column constructed by coupling a synthetic amino terminal beta chain fibrin peptide Gly His Arg Pro Leu Asp Lys Cys Hui, K. Y. A quantitative fibrinolytic assay was devised by linking fibrin monomer to Sepharose. Kabi grade L fibrinogen 500 mg was dissolved in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 and then passed over lysine Sepharose to eliminate traces of plasminogen. The purified fibrinogen was trace labeled by the addition of 150 uCi 125 I fibrinogen IBRIN and the mixture coupled to 150 ml cyanogen bromide activated Sepharose 4B Cl. After thorough washing, the gel was suspended in 0.1 M Tris, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.02 NaN₃, pH 7.4 TBSA and the immobilized fibrinogen converted to fibrin by addition of human thrombin 1 NIH unit ml in the presence of 100 mM CaCl₂. After 4 liters of washing, 125 I fibrin Sepharose was stored in TBSA at 0 degrees. The substituted Sepharose was stable, releasing 0.1 of its radioactivity at 2.5 hours and 2.1 at 15 hours on incubation in the absence of urokinase containing conjugates. To assess their relative fibrinolytic activity, increasing amounts of 125 I UK SS 64C5 and unconjugated urokinase were incubated with 100 ul of 125 I fibrin Sepharose for 4 hours. The Sepharose was then washed first with 3 ml of a solution comprising 0.1 M Tris, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.5 bovine serum albumin and 0.5 Triton X 100 and then with three 3 ml aliquots of TBSA. Thereafter, the resin was incubated at room temperature with purified plasminogen Deutsch, D. G. In order to obtain kinetic information 125 I UK SS 3H3 , or 125 I UK SS 64C5 in TBSA containing 0.12 mg ml plasminogen were recirculated over a 0.3 x 5 cm column containing 300 ul 125 I fibrin Sepharose at a rate of 1 ml per minute. At indicated times, three samples of 1 ml each were collected and their radioactivity determined. Figure 1 indicates that the concentration of 125 I UK SS 64C5 required to release labeled peptides from fibrin Sepharose was 1 100 of that of unconjugated urokinase. The myosin antibody conjugate 125 I UK SS 3H3 did not differ significantly from unconjugated urokinase. Figure 2 shows that 125 I UK SS 64C5 markedly enhances the rate of release of peptides from fibrin Sepharose and that this is unimpaired by fibrinogen at a physiologic concentration. BPeptide inhibits fibrinolysis of 125 I UK SS 64C5 , whereas it has no effect on the fibrinolytic rate of unconjugated urokinase or 125 I UK SS 3H3 data not shown . A monoclonal antibody specific for fibrin is able to target the plasminogen activator urokinase to fibrin and by virtue of enhanced local concentration, increase the efficiency of plasmin lysis by 100 fold. The antibody is sufficiently fibrin specific so that physiologic effects of fibrinogen do not interfere with enhanced fibrinolysis. Fibrinolytic effectiveness is not enhanced by coupling of urokinase to a monoclonal antibody of irrelevant specificity but it is markedly diminished by a peptide representing the epitope recognized by the fibrin specific antibody.
