## Description
REFORMATE UPGRADING This invention relates to a process to upgrade reformate. More particularly, the present invention is directed towards a process for increasing the octane number of reformate. The upgrading of reformates to improve the octane number of gasolines, as well as the yield octane relationship, has been the subject of much activity in the petroleum industry over the years. Recently, however, because of the greater awareness of the problem of environmental control, as well as air pollution, greater impetus has been given to investigations directed towards increasing the octane number of gasoline without the use of lead. In order to reduce automobile exhaust emissions to meet federal and state pollution requirements, many automobile manufacturers have now equipped the exhaust systems of their vehicles with catalytic converters which contain catalysts which are poisoned by lead. Since lead has been widely used in the past to boost the octane number of gasoline, refiners now have to turn to alternate means to improve gasoline octane number. One method to boost gasoline octane number is to boost the octane number of the various constituents of gasoline, such as reformate. It has long been known to upgrade a reformate by a wide variety of techniques including treatment with crystalline zeolites. The treatment of a reformate with crystalline zeolites heretofore practiced has included both physical treatment such as selective adsorption, as well as chemical treatments such as selective conversion. U.S. Patents 3,729,409 and 3,767,568 disclose methods of improving the yield octane number of reformate or reformer effluent by contacting same with crystalline zeolites, such as ZSM 5. In order to use conventional ZSM 5 zeolite, e.g. silica to alumina mole ratio of about 70 to 1, to boost the octane number of reformate in an existing reformer unit, the reformate must be cooled from about 9รป0 F 483or to about 600 7000F 316 372 C . Thus there would have to be additional capital expenditure for existing reforming units to boost octane using conventional ZSM 5, since extra equipment would be required to cool the reformate. One object of the instant invention is to upgrade the octane number of a full range reformate. Another object of the present invention is boost the octane number of reformate using existing equipment without undue construction delay or capital expenditure. It has now been discovered that the octane number of reformate or reformer effluent can be dramatically increased by contacting same with a catalyst comprising a highly siliceous zeolite, with or without a hydrogenation component. Such highly siliceous zeolites are characterized by a silica to alumina mole ratio of at least 200 to 1 and a constraint index in the approximate range of 1 to 12. The significance and manner of determination of constraint index is described in our G.B. SpecificationNo. 1,446,522. The highly siliceous zeolite containing catalysts can be used in conjunction with existing reforming units, since they can operate at the temperatures and pressures of such units. They may be utilized in the last reactor of the string of reforming reactors in existing units without extensive time delay or any additional capital expense. According to the invention, the octane number of full range reformate can be extensively increased, for example, from about 96 to about 101 R O research octane number with no added lead at temperatures in the range of between about 8000F 4270C and about 9000F 4830C .

R O for the same two zeolites utilized in FIGURE 1 to upgrade reformate. Reformates or reformer effluents which are composed substantially of aromatic and paraffinic constituents can be prepared according to conventional reforming technology by contacting any suitable material such as a naphtha chargestock boiling in the range of about C5 and preferably from about C6 up to about 3800F 1940C and higher with hydrogen at least initially in contact with any conventional reforming operation. A conventional reforming operation is described in United States Patent 3,395,094. Conventional reforming catalysts include, for example, alumina in the eta, chi, or gamma form and mixtures thereof in combination with a chromium, molybdenum, or noble metal. Platinum type includes, for example, the metal series which includes platinum, palladium, osmium, iridium, ruthenium or rhodium and mixtures thereof deposited on a suitable support. Metals of Group VIIA, in cluding rhenium, may be used in combination with platinumtype metals. Generally, the major portion of the catalyst will be alumina, which may comprise as much as about 95 by weight or more of the catalyst. Other components may be combined with the alumina carrier, such as the oxides of silica, magnesium, zirconium, thorium, vanadium, titanium, boron or mixtures thereof.The platinum alumina combination, either with or without one or more of the above listed components such as silica, etc., may also be promoted with small amounts of halogen such as chlorine and fluorine, in amounts ranging from about 0.1 up to about 5 by weight. Generally, less than about 3 of halogen is employed with the platium type catalyst. In a preferred embodiment, the reforming catalyst carrier material is a relatively high surface area material, preferably an eta alumina material of at least about 100 square meters per gram. In the reforming process, typical reforming operating conditions including temperatures in the range of from about 8000F 4270C to about 1,0000F 5380C , preferably from about 8900F 4770 C up to about 9800F 5270C , liquid hourly space velocity in the range of from about 0.1 to about 10, preferably from about 0.5 to about 5 a pressure in the range of from about atmospheric up to about 800 psig 5618 kPa and higher, preferably from about 100 psig 791 kPa to about 600 psig 4239 kPa and a hydrogen hydrocarbon ratio in the range of from about 0.5 to about 20 and preferablyjfrom about 1 to about 10. In the process of this invention, the reformate or reformer effluent is contacted with or without added hydrogen over the highly siliceous zeolite containing catalysts of the instant invention. The production of reformate via a reforming reaction always results in the production of hydrogen. Practically, it is undesirable to separate out the hydrogen because it would add to processing cost. It is to be immediately understood, however, that it is not necessary to have a hydrogenation dehydrogenation component associated with the catalyst, although such is a preferred embodiment of this invention. Thus, in its broadest form this invention includes, processing of a reformate or reformer effluent either in the absence or in the presence of hydrogen over the zeolite catalysts of the present invention with or without an added hydrogenation component. The amount of the hydrogenation dehydrogenation component employed is not narrowly critical and can range from about 0.01 to about 30 weight percent based on the entire catalyst including binder. A variety of hydrogenation components may be combined with either the zeolite and or matrix in any feasible manner which affords intimate contact of the components, employing well known techniques such as base exchange, impregnation, coprecipitation, cogellation, mechanical admixture of one component with the other, and the like.The hydrogenation component can include metals, oxides, and sulfides of metals of thePeriodic Chart which fall in Group VIA including chromium, molybdenum, tungsten and the like Group IIB including zinc cadmium, Group VIIA including manganese and rhenium and Group VIIIA including cobalt, nickel, platinum, palladium, ruthenium, rhodium and the like, and combinations of metals, sulfides and oxides thereof, including the combination of the metals of Group VIA and VII IA, such as nickel tungsten sulfide, cobalt oxide molybdenum oxide and the like. Any reference to Periodic Table , Periodic Chart or Group as used herein shall refer to the Periodic Chart of the Elements of the Fisher ScientificCompany, Cat. No. 5 702 10, 1978. Conversion in accordance with the present process is generally carried out at a temperature between about 8000F 427 C and about 1,0500F 5660C and preferably between about 8500F 4550C to 9500F 5100C . The hydrogen pressure, if such is used, in such operation is generally within the range of between about 50 psig 447 kPa and about 1000 psig 6996 kPa and preferably between about 200 psig 1481 kPa to about 500 psig 3549 kPa .The liquid hourly space velocity, i.e., the liquid volume of hydrocarbon per hour per volume of catalyst is between about 0.1 and about 10, and preferably between about 1 and 5. In general the molar ratio of hydrogen to hydrocarbon charge i.e. reformate, employed is between about 1 and about 80, and preferably between about 2 and 15. The silica to alumina mole ratio referred to may be determined by conventional analysis. This ratio is meant to represent, as closely as possible, the ratio in the rigid anionic framework of the crystal and to exclude aluminum in the binder or in cationic or other form within the channels. In highly siliceous zeolites, the upper limit of silica to alumina mole ratio is unbounded.ZSM 5, is one such example wherein the silica to alumina mole ratio is at least 5, but can be 100, 1,000, 10,000, or even greater, i.e. up to and including infinity. The highly siliceous zeolites of this invention are characterized by a silica to alumina mole ratio of at least 200 and it is preferred that the silica to alumina mole ratio be higher, e.g. silica to alumina mole ratios of 500 to 1, 1,000 to 1, 1,400 to 1, 1,600 to 1 and greater. The preferred zeolites, after activation, acquire an intracrystalline sorption capacity for normal hexane which is greater than that for water, i.e. they exhibit hydrophobic properties. It is believed that this hydrophobic character is advantageous in many instances. Constraint Index CI values for some typical substances are Constraint Index ZSM 4 0.5 ZSM 5 8.3 ZSM ll 8.7 ZSM 12 2 ZSM 23 9.1 ZSM 35 4.5 ZSM 38 2 ZSM 48 3.4 TMA Offretite 3.7 Beta 0.6 H Zeolon mordenite 0.4 REY 0.4 Amorphous Silica Alumina 0.6 Erionite 38 Clinoptilolite 3.4 There may be situations where the activity is so low, i.e., silica to alumina mole ratio approaching infinity, that the Constraint Index cannot be adequately measured, if at all. In such situations, Constraint Index is to mean the Constraint Index of the same zeolite same crystal structure as determined by X ray diffraction pattern in an alumina containing form. The preferred zeolites are ZSM 5, ZSM ll, ZSM 12,ZSM 48 and other similar materials. Highly siliceous ZSM 5 is described in greater detail in U.S. Patent Re. No. 29,948.

ZSM ll is similar to ZSM 5 with the notable exception that whereas ZSM 5 contains a doublet at about 10.1, 3.73, 3.00 and 2.01 A interplanar spacing, ZSM ll shows a singlet at these values. This means that the crystal class of ZSM ll is different from that of the other zeolites. ZSM ll is tetragonal whereas ZSM 5 tends to be orthorhombic. The sodium form as well as other cationic forms reveal substantially the same pattern with minor shifts in interplanar spacing and variation of relative intensity.

From these, the relative intensities, 100 I Io, where 10 is the intensity of the strongest line or peak, and d obs. , the interplanar spacing in A, corresponding to the recorded lines, were estimated. InTable 2, the relative intensities are given in terms of the symbols m medium, w weak and vs very strong. It should be understood that thisX ray diffraction pattern is characteristic of all the species of ZSM 12 compositions.The sodium form as well as other cationic forms reveal substantially the same pattern with some minor shifts in interplanar spacing and variation in relative intensity. Other minor variations can occur depending on the silicon to aluminum mole ratio of the particular sample, as well as its degree of thermal treatment. Crystallization of the aforementioned substances described in U.S. Application Ser. Nos. 003,143 003,145 003,146 and 003,144 can be generally carried out at either static or stirred conditions. Static conditions can be achieved using polypropylene jars at about 1000C or.teflon lined stainless steel autoclaves at about 160 0C. Static conditions can also be carried out under pressure in a static bomb reactor. The total useful range of temperatures is about 80 0C to about 180 0C for about 6 hours to 150 days. Thereafter, the zeolites are separated from the liquid and recovered. The composition can be prepared utilizing materials which supply the appropriate oxides.Depending on the particular zeolite formulation desired, reaction mixtures can include sodium, silicate, silica hydrosol, silica gel, silicic acid, sodium hydroxide, chromic potassium sulfate, or ferric ammonium sulfate. The organic compounds can include any element of Group VB such as nitrogen, phosphorous, arsenic, antimony, or bismuth, preferably nitrogen or phosphorous. However, in the case of Application Ser. No.003,146, the organic compounds include the tetraethyl derivatives of Group VB elements. The preferred compounds are quaternary compounds generally expressed by the following formula EMI16.1 wherein L is an element of Group B of thePeriodic Chart, preferably nitrogen, and each R is an alkyl or aryl group having between 1 and 7 preferably between 2 and 5 carbon atoms. It may be preferable in some formulations that at least one R group be an ethyl group or a butyl group. Normally each alkyl or aryl group will be the same, however it is not necessary that each group have the same number of carbon atoms in the chain. The oxide of the quaternary compound is generally supplied by introducing into the reaction mixture a composition such as the tetraethyl or tetrabutyl as the case may be hydroxide or chloride of the desired VB element. In preparing an ammonium species, the organic substituted chloride, bromide, or hydroxide is useful. In preparing the phosphonium species of the zeolite, tetraethyl or tetrabutyl as the case may be phosphonium chloride is particularly desirable as a means of incorporating the quaternary compound in the zeolite. The other elements of Group VB behave similarly and thus zeolites containing the same can be prepared by the same manipulative procedure substituting another Group VB metal for nitrogen.It should be realized that the oxide can be supplied from more than one source. The reaction mixture can be prepared either batchwise or continuously. Crystal size and crystallization time of the zeolite composition will vary with the nature of the reaction mixture employed and the crystallization conditions. The quaternary compounds need not be used as such. They may be produced in situ by the addition of the appropriate precursors. These precursors comprise a compound characterized by the formula R 1R2R3 L whereR1, R2 and R3 are selected from alkyl, substituted alkyl, aryl, substituted aryl, cycloalkyl, substituted cycloalkyl and hydrogen and L is an element of Group VB and a compound of the formula R4L where R4 is alkyl substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl, substituted cycloalkyl, aryl and substituted aryl and L is an electronegative group. According to a special embodiment, the method of the zeolite preparation can be practiced using the compound R1R2R3L alone.Thus, in specific embodiments one may use as the source of R2 0, amines or phosphines either primary, secondary or tertiary as well as diamines without addition of any R4X. Zeolite preparation is facilitated by the presence of at least 0.001 , preferably at least 0.01 , and still more preferably at least 0.1 seed crystals based on total weight of crystalline product . ZSM 48 is described in U.S. Application Ser. No.003,142, filed January 18, 1979. ZSM 48 can be identified, in terms of moles of anhydrous oxides per 100 moles of silica as follows O to 1 15 RN O to l.5 M O to 2 A1203 lO0 SiO2 wherein M is at least one cation having a valence n, RN is a C1 C20 organic compound having at least one amine functional group of pKa 7, and wherein the composition is characterized by the distinctive X ray diffraction pattern as shown in Table 3 below. It is recognized that, particularly when the composition contains tetrahedral, framework aluminum, a fraction of the amine functional groups may be protonated. The doubly protonated form, in conventional notation, would be RNH 20 and is equivalent in stoichiometry to 2RN H20. The X ray diffraction pattern of ZSM 48 has the following significant lines TABLE 3 CHARACTERISTIC LINES OF ZSM 48 d Relative Intensity 11.9 W S 10.2 W 7.2 W 5.9 W 4.2 VS 3.9 VS These values were determined by standard techniques. The radiation was the K alpha doublet of copper, and and a scintillation counter spectrometer with a strip chart pen recorder was used. The peak heights, I, and the positions as a function of 2 times theta, where theta is the Bragg angle, were read from the spectrometer chart.From these, the relative intensities, 100 I Io, where 10 is the intensity of the strongest line or peak, and d obs. , the interplanar spacing in A, corresponding to the recorded lines, were calculated. In Table 3 the relative intensities are given in terms of the symbols W weak,VS very strong and W S weak to strong. Ion exchange of the sodium ion with cations reveals substantially the same pattern with some minor shifts in interplanar spacing and variation in relative intensity. Other minor variations can occur depending on the silica to alumina mole ratio of the particular sample, as well as if it has been subjected to thermal treatment. Highly siliceous ZSM 48 can be prepared from a reaction mixture containing a source of silica, RN, an alkali metal oxide, e.g. sodium and water, and having a composition, in terms of mole ratios of oxides, falling within the folowing ranges REACTANTS BROAD PREFERRED A1203 SiO2 O to 0.02 0 to 0.01 Na Si02 O to 2 0.1 to 1.0RN SiO2 0.01 to 2.0 0.05 to 1.0 OH SiO2 O to 0.25 0 to 0.1 H20 Si02 10 to 100 20 to 70 H added SiO2 O to 0.2 0 to 0.05 wherein RN is a C1 C20 organic compound having amine functional group of pK 7, and maintaining the mixture at 80 2500C until crystals of ZSM 48 are formed.H added is moles acid added in excess of the moles of hydroxide added. In calculating H added and OH values, the term acid H includes both hydronium ion, whether free or coordinated, and aluminum. An amine hydrochloride would be a mixture of amine and HC1. In preparing the highly siliceous form of ZSM 48 no alumina is added. The only aluminum present occurs as an impurity. Preferably, crystallization is carried out under pressure in an autoclave or static bomb reactor, at 80 to 250 C. Thereafter, the crystals are separated from the liquid and recovered. The composition can be prepared utilizing materials which supply the appropriate oxide.Such compositions include sodium silicate, silica hydrosol, silica gel, silicic acid, RN, sodium hydroxide, sodium chloride, etc. RN is a C1 C20 organic compound containing at least one amine functional group of pKa 7 and includes such compounds as C3 C18 primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, cyclic amine, such as piperidine, pyrrolidine and piperazine, and polyamines such as NH2 CnH2n NH2 wherein n is 4 12. Many of the specific zeolites described, when prepared in the presence of organic cations, are unsuitable for use herein, possibly because the intracrystalline free space is occupied by organic cations from the forming solution. Such zeolites may be made suitable by heating in an inert atmosphere at 5400C for one hour, for example, followed by base exchange with ammonium salts followed by calcination at 54OOC in air. The presence of organic cations in the forming solution may not be absolutely essential to the formation of this type zeolite however, the presence of these cations does appear to favor the formation of many members of this special class of zeolite.More generally, it is desirable to activate this type zeolite by base exchange with ammonium salts followed by calcination in air at about 540 C for from about 15 minutes to about 24 hours. Natural zeolites may sometimes be converted to this type zeolite by various activation procedures and other treatments such as base exchange, steaming, alumina extraction and calcination, alone or in combinations.Natural minerals which may be so treated include ferrierite, brewsterite, stilbite, dachiardite, epistilbite, heulandite, and clinoptilolite. In a preferred aspect, the zeolites hereof are selected as those having a crystal framework density, in the dry hydrogen form, of not less than about 1.6 grams per cubic centimeter. Crystal framework densities of some typical zeolites, including some which are not within the purview of this description, are Void Framework Volume DensityFerrierite 0.28 cc cc 1.76 g ccMordenite .28 1.7ZSM 5, 11 .29 1.79ZSM 12 1.8ZSM 23 2.0Dachiardite .32 1.72L .32 1.61Clinoptilolite .34 1.71Laumontite .34 1.77ZSM 4 Omega .38 1.65Heulandite .39 1.69P .41 1.57Offretite .40 1.55Levynite .40 1.54Erionite .35 1.51 Gmelinite .44 1.46Chabazite .47 1.45A .5 1.3Y .48 1.27 A preferred embodiment of this invention resides in the use of a porous matrix together with the highly siliceous zeolites previously described.The highly siliceous zeolite can be combined, dispersed or otherwise intimately admixed with a porous matrix in such proportions that the resulting product contains from one to 95 percent by weight, and preferably from 10 to 70 percent by weight of the highly siliceous zeolite in the final composite. The term porous matrix includes inorganic compositions with which the zeolites can be combined, dispersed or otherwise intimately admixed wherein the matrix may be active or inactive. It is to be understood that the porosity of the compositions employed as a matrix can either be inherent in the particular material or it can be introduced by mechanical or chemical means. Representative matrices which can be employed included metals and alldys thereof, sintered metals and sintered glass, asbestos, silicon carbide aggregates, pumice, firebrick, diatomaceous earths, alumina, and inorganic oxides. Inorganic compositions, especially those of a siliceous nature, are preferred.Of these matrices, inorganic oxides such as clay, chemically treated clay, silica, silica alumina, etc. are particularly preferred because of their superior porosity, attrition, resistance, and stability. Techniques for such incorporation of highly siliceous zeolites in a matrix are conventional in the art.The incorporation of zeolites in a matrix is set forth inUnited States Patent No. 3,140,253. The novel process of this invention can be carried out in a wide variety of techniques utilizing the process parameters previously set forth. Thus, it is possible to carry out this selective conversion in a separate reactor. In this embodiment a conventional reformer is operated so as to yield a reformate of the type previously set forth and then the reformate or reactor effluent, together with added hydrogen is passed into a separate reactor containing the zeolite catalyst previously set forth with or without a hydrogenation component in the manner previously set forth.In another embodiment of this invention a separate reactor need not be employed, but rather, the last reactor in a conventional three reactor reforming operation can be filled with a conventional platinum reforming catalyst and with the zeolite catalyst previously set forth so that hydrocarbon feed first contacts the conventional platinum reforming catalyst and then zeolite catalyst. Thus, a feed material would undergo conventional reforming in the first two stages of a conventional reactor and then would enter into a third stage wherein conventional reforming would be carried out at the top of the reactor followed by the selective conversion in the bottom of the reactor with the zeolite catalyst. This embodiment has the advantage of utilizing existing equipment and carrying out the novel process of this invention.In a further embodiment of the instant invention, the novel process described herein can take place in a reforming unit which employs an extra reactor swing reactor . This extra reactor is usually the last of four reactors in a reformer unit. The novel catalyst of this invention can be employed under typical reforming conditions, e.g. 9000F 4830C temperature, 1.7 LHSV, 350 psig 2515 kPa pressure and 7 H2 HC. There is no need to cool the reformate down to between about 6000F 3160C and 7000F 3720C as would be required for conventional ZSM 5, e.g. ZSM 5 with a silica to alumina mole ratio of about 70 to 1. The novel catalyst of the instant invention boosts reformate octane and exhibits high selectivity for cracking normal and mono branched paraffins of typical reforming operating conditions. The shape selectivity for the highly siliceous zeolite containing catalysts of this invention is comparable to conventional zeolite catalysts having the same constraint index. For example, highly siliceous HZSM 5 is just as shape selective for paraffin cracking as the con ventional HZSM 5 catalyst. The amounts of methane and butane produced are comparable and more ethane and propane is produced. When operating under typical reforming conditions, the catalyst of the instant invention does more dealkylation than conventional HZSM 5 catalysts. Lower boiling aromatics are formed by the dealkylation reaction, resulting in a higher volatility gasoline than that made by conventional HZSM 5 at the same octane number. Also, greater dealkylation is desirable where an objective is to maximize benzene and or toluene yield. The following examples will serve to illustrate the invention without limiting same. Example 1 This example illustrates the preparation of a highly siliceous HZSM 5 with a silica to alumina mole ratio of about 1600 to 1. Prereacted Organics Preparation The following materials were charged to an autoclave 0.30 parts methylethyl ketone, 0.18 parts tri npropylamine and 0.15 parts n propyl bromide. The contents were mixed with gentle agitation for 15 minutes. The agitat ion was stopped and 1 part water was charged to the autoclave. The autoclave was sealed and heated to 2200F 1050C and held at 2200F 1050C for 15 hours. After this reaction period the temperature was raised to 32O0F 1600C and the unreacted organics were flashed off. The aqueous phase was removed containing the prereacted organics and contained 1.44 wt. nitrogen. Zeolite Synthesis Solution Preparation Silicate Solution 1 part Q brand sodium silicate 0.58 parts H20 0.0029 parts Daxad 27 Acid Solution 0.10 parts H2504 0.045 parts NaCl 0.56 parts prereacted organics 0.16 parts H20 Additional Solids 0.14 parts NaCl Additional Liquid 0.029 parts H20Procedure The silicate solution and acid solution were mixed in a mixing nozzle to form a gel which was discharged into an autoclave to which 0.029 parts water had been previously added. The gel was whipped by agitation and 0.14 parts NaCl were added and thoroughly blended.The autoclave was sealed and heated to 220F 1050C with agitation at 90 rpm and held for 54.3 hours until crystallization was complete. The contents of the autoclave were cooled and discharged. The crystallized product was analyzed by X ray diffraction and was found to 100 wt. ZSM 5. The chemical analysis of the thoroughly washed crystalline product was Wt.

The extrudate was then exchanged for four hours with nickel nitrate solution 5cc in Ni NO3 2 6 H20 g catalyst at 80 900C and then for four hours with fresh nickel nitrate solution at room temperature. The extrudate was washed, dried and calcined for 3 hours in flowing air at 5380C, then sulfided with a flowing mixture of 2 H2S in hydrogen at 750 C. The physical and chemical properties of the final catalyst were as follows ZSM 5 65 Na, Wt 0.06Ni, Wt 0.83Particle Density, g cc 1.00Crush Strength, lb in 16 SiO2 A1203 mole 1400 to 1 ratio Examples 2 to 10 The following examples will illustrate the novel process of this invention. In each case, the chargestock was a reformate obtained by contacting naphtha together with hydrogen over a platinum reforming catalyst at about 8000F 4270C to 1000F 5380C , a pressure of about 350 psig 2515 kPa and 7 H2 HC. The properties of this chargestock are given in Table 4. In Examples 3 to 10, the reformate was contacted with a catalyst representative of the novel catalyst of this invention. Said catalyst was prepared according to Example 1. The catalyst was contacted with the reformate at temperatures in the range between about 8000F 4270C and 9000F 4830C and space velocities in the range between about 1.5 and 6.5. The results for Examples 2 to 10 are given in Table 5. Example 2 was a blank thermal run charging the lowest feed rate 7 ml hr over 8 14 mesh T 61 alumina manufactured by Alcoa . Said alumina served as the diluent for the ZSM 5 extrudate In the other examples. Examples 3, 4 and 5 employed 1.08 g 2.0cc of the catalyst prepared according to Example 1 and mixed with 15.5g 8.0cc of 8 14 mesh T 61 alumina. Examples 7 to 11 utilized 2.829 5.0cc of the catalyst prepared according to Example 1 and mixed with 9.29 5.0cc of 8 14 mesh T 61 alumina. The results for Examples 2 to 10 are given inTable 5 the LHSV for Example 2 was based on 10 cc of T 61 alumina of 8 14 mesh the LHSV for Examples 3 to 10 was based on ZSM 5 . As shown in Table 5, the blank thermal run overT 61 alumina showed only a very small amount of cracking thus establishing that the 1400 1 SiO2 A1203 Ni HZSM 5 has catalytic activity. Example 11 This example illustrates the preparation ofHZSM 5 with SiO2 A1203 mole ratio of about 140 to 1. A sodium silicate solution was prepared by mixing 33.5 parts water and 57.8 parts sodium silicate 28.7 wt. SiO2, 8.9 wt. Na20, 62.4 wt. X H20 . An acid solution was prepared by adding 1 part aluminum sulfate 17.2 wt. A1203 to 34.3 parts water followed by 5.3 parts sulfuric acid 97 wt. H2SO4 and 6.8 parts NaCl. These solutions were mixed in an agitated vessel and 4.0 parts NaCl were added. The gel molar ratios expressed as oxides are the following SiO2 A1203 164 Na2 0 A1203 104 An brganic solution was prepared by adding 3.3 parts n propyl bromide and 6.4 parts methyl ethyl ketone to 3.9 parts tri n propylamine. Agitation was stopped and this solution was added to the above formed gel. The mixture was heated to about 95 1100C and held for about 16 hours, then severe agitation was resumed. When more than 65 of the gel was crystallized, the temperature was increased to 150 1700C and held there until crystallization was complete. Unreacted organics were removed by flashing and the remaining contents cooled. The zeolite was separated from the liquor by filtration. The wet cake was reslurried and filtered until the sodium level was reduced to 1.3 wt. The final wet cake was dried. The dried zeolite was then mixed with alumina and water. It was then extruded into 1 16 pellets and dried. The extruded material contained 65 parts ZSM 5 per 35 parts alumina. The dried extrudate was calcined for three hours at 5380C in flowing nitrogen. After cooling, the extrudate was contacted twice with an ammonium nitrate exchange solution about 0.4 lb. NH4N03 lb. extrudate for one hour at ambient temperature. The extrudate was then contacted four times with an ammonium nitrate solution about 0.4 lb. NH4N03 lb. extrudate for one hour at about 80 900C. The sodium level was 0.06 wt. . The extrudate was then contacted with a nickel nitrate exchange solution about 0.7 lb. Ni N03 2 6H20 lb. extrudate for four hours at about 80 90 C. After this exchange, the extrudate was washed, dried and calcined in flowing air at 5380C for three hours, and sulfided according to the same procedure as given in Example 1. Examples 12 to 21 In Examples 12 to 21, the feed employed was the same reformate chargestock as used in Examples 2 to 10, i.e. of Table 4. The catalyst used in Examples 12 to 21 was a conventional HZSM 5 with a silica to alumina mole ratio of 140 to 1 prepared according to Example 1. The purpose of these examples was to use them as a comparison to representatives of the novel catalysts of the instant invention as previously shown in Examples 3 to 10. In Examples 12 to 21, 0.229 0.33 cc of sulfided 1 16 extrudate HZSM 5 with 0.8 wt nickel was mixed with 19g 9.7 cc of 8 14 mesh T 61 alumina. The catalyst was contacted with the chargestock at about 9000F 483oC . The results for Examples 12 to 21 are shown in Table 6. Referring now to FIGURE 1, there is shown a plot of benzene yields versus C5 octane no. Research with no lead added using the data of Examples 6 to 10 and 12 to 21 described above. The 1600 1 SiO2 A1203 mole ratio ZSM 5 catalyst of Examples 6 to 10 clearly gave a higher benzene yield than the 140 1 SiO2 A1203 mole ratio ZSM 5 catalyst of Examples 12 to 21 at the same C5 O.N. Likewise, FIGURE 2 shows a higher toluene yield for the 1600 1 SiO2 Al 203 catalyst FIGURE 3 shows lower C8 aromatic yield for the 1600 1SiO2 A1203 catalyst and FIGURE 4 shows lower C9 aromatic yield for the 1600 1 SiO2 A1203 catalyst.
