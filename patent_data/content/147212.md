# Method for determining the operability of a source range detector.

## Abstract
A method of determining the operability of a source range detector located adjacent a nuclear reactor in which the source range detector generates a count corresponding to the neutrons emitted by the reactor when the reactor is operating within the source range and a predetermined voltage is applied across the electrodes of the detector, the detector being subjected to destruction when the reactor power level is above the source range and the predeter mined voltage is applied across its electrodes. The method includes the steps of a operating the reactor at a power level above the source range b applying a voltage across the electrodes of the detector, the voltage having a magni tude below that necessary to generate a neutron count from the detector c gradually increasing the magnitude of the voltage across the electrodes of the detector until the detector just begins to generate a neutron count d reducing the voltage across the electrodes of the detector and e replacing the detector if a neutron count is not generated in step c at a voltage having a magnitude less than the predetermined voltage.
