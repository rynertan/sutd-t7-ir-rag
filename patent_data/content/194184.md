# Universal joint yoke.

## Abstract
A universal joint yoke is obtained from a flat blank of sheet metal whose general shape is that of a cruciate form having a circular base and two diametrically opposing small ellipse shaped extensions. The blank of sheet metal is press ed in a forming apparatus so that the two extensions are bent perpendicularly to the circular base in the same direction with a given angle with respect to the circular base and two ribs 33a, 33b or contiguous rib are formed along axes of bending to prevent a springback action of the two extensions which constitute two ear portions 30a, 30b of the finished yoke. In addition, recesses 34a are extended along a rear surface s of the rib s so that fastening means 40a, 49a, 40c, 49c for fastening a rubber coupling 35 constituting a lower joint to a lower shaft 39 of a steering system is nestled into the respective recesses. Both ends of the circular base 28 have holes through which fastening means for fastening the universal joint yoke to the rubber coupling is inserted. Distal ends of the two ear portions 30a, 30b have also coaxial holes 37a through which two trunnions of a universal joint cross member is journalled.
