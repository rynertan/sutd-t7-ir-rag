# Improved X ray image intensifying screens comprising rare earth oxyhalide phosphor particles.

## Abstract
An X ray image intensifying screen, which includes in a binder layer rare earth oxyhalide phosphor particles that are in contact or admixed with an inorganic or organic substance or mixture of substances bringing about that the fluorescence power of said oxyhalide phosphor particles is less prone to be reduced by moisture, said substance being a non phosphor substance or a phosphor substance other than calcium tungstate and producing hydroxyl ions when put in water, wherein the hydroxyl ion production power of said substance is such that when putting said substance in water at 25 C in an amount of 0.1 equivalent per litre a pH of at least 8.0 is obtained and the solubility in water of said substance is such that at least 0.05 g of said substance is soluble in 100 ml of water at 20 C.
