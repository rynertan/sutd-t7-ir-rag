# Multiple hull sailing boat.

## Abstract
This boat consists of three tables. The central table I is provided ahead with an housing for the mast 6 and astern with one or more seats 7 with backboards 8 , thus they are suitable for one or more sitting persons who can operate a couple of foot pedals 10 controlling the rudder. In this way, person s has have both hands free and can govern the sail plan through ropes, easier than in a standard type of sailing boat. The table I is also provided with a continuous fairing 12a, 13a, 14a which make it possible to avoid splashing sitting person s While securing aboard, as well as to have a space also behind seats astern, to be used as container. The lateral tables 2 and 3 are joined to central one I by beams through a sliding system which permit person s sitting on the table I to approach or remove the lateral tables also in independent way. The three tables can be made of either rigid or pneuma tic material.

## Description
wLPROVED 5AILIN BOAT The subject of this invention is an improved sailing boat.The most important problems in boat projecting of smallsize boats in particular, are connected to production cost and manoeuvrability in transport and storingTherefore , the purpose of this invention is to provide sn improved boat with very reduced production costs and extremely limited dimensions and weight in order to make boat transport andDhandling easily. A further purpose of this invention is to produce a boat that can be steered by one or more persons gifted with no particular strength or balance being comfortably and safely sitting on board, a boat offering, when desired, the same perfomance and pleasure as the sailing boats already on the market.Another purpose is to provide a boat extremely easy to mou nt and disassemble both on land and in the water.This boat achieves not only the above purposes, but also some others hereunder shown. The boat consists of three tables, a central one and two lateral ones,joined to give the boat remarkable floating and stability.The central table may, or may not, be made of the same materials as the lateral ones. Though the features of this boat, that are shown hereunder, do not change, there are various consiruttive possibilities it is possible to make all three tables of a rigid material it is possible to make the central table of a rigid material and the lateral tables of a pneumatic material finally, it is possible to make all three tables of z pneumatic material.It is obvious that in the latter two alternatives, transport and storing of the boat, will be easier.The central table presents astern one or more seats with backboard in fact,this table is suitable for a person, at least, sittiflg On it with his shoulders against the said backboard ahead, the table present also an housing for a mast,conrected to the sail plan chosen according to desired performances. Further features and advantages of this invention will be setter underlined in the following, more detailed desripti on of a construction having a non exclusive but a preferable design shown as a mere example hereunder, such a constru ction being not restrictive.The enclosed drawings show I vertical longitudinal section of the boat 2 top view of the boat without mast 3 side view 4 stern fairing.This boat consists of a central table I and two lateral tables 2 and 3 joined by beams 4 ahead,the table T presents an housing 5 where the mast is inserted the mast is connected to the sail plan. Astern, the table t is provided with one or more seats 7 and one or more backboaroa 8 connected to the table I so as to be folded in transport.The table is equipped with a rudder 9 and a couple of foot peals IO connected to the table I and driving the rudder 9 through cables II , The table I is suitable for one or more persons comfort ably sitting on the seat s 7i with shoulders against backboard s 8 and operating the foot pedals IO that control the rudder 9 . In this way, person s having both hands free can steer the boat equipment through ropes easier than in a standard type of sailing boat. he central table I is also provided of a continuous fii ring divided, for reasons of clearness, into bow, side and stern fairing. Such bow I2a and I2b , side I3a and I3b and stern I4a andI4b fairings are connected to the table and thus seaworthiness is not affected as floating is ensured by the table I . In this way,the fairings can be easily mounted on the table through set screws or joints or other means so that they can be easily removed or folded on the table I during boat transport as well as remounted both on the grennd and in the water.Constructive materials for bow and stern fairings can be various, even of rigid type 80 as to get a better water rg sistance,while lighter materials, plasticized clothes for example, can be used for side fairings 13a and I3b o Such clothes will be fastened to the table I and to bow and stern fairings, for example by means of hooks and eyeletsThe continuous fairing surrounding bow, sides and stern of the table I avoid splashing person s sitting on the table and any side falling because of rolls. Another purpose consists in getting spa e to be used at containers both ahead I5 and astern I6 .The space ahead is obtained through a panel I7 that,from the table I , closes the no fairing Iaa and I2b at the top, and through a front I8 nerpendicular to the table I . The space astern is obtained behind the backboard s closing the stern fairings I4a and I4b at the top through panel 19 that space starts behind the backboard s 8 , lowers and ends at the table I extremity.Joints can be, for example, wedged type. order to make that space as dry as possible, will be z fficent a bulkhead 20 joining from the table I the Stern fairings and the panel 19 that closes those fairings. The bulkhead can be also used as backboard s support.The lateral tables 2and 3 are joined to the table I , by beams 4 and give the boat remarkable floating and staby lity. Each table is provided with a fin keel 21 that can be placed in a proper housing 22 when not in use. Uhe lateral tables 2and 3 and beams 4 can be also removed completely during transport. The system to jmin all three tables consists of stout beams 4 , for example elastic wood, joined the table I to tables and 3 , both ahead and astern.The beams are fastened to the three tables by means of,for example, elastic or leather belts 23 which join the teral tables so that they can be moved towards or removed from the central table,either in a dependent or in indepen dent way. For this purpose, it is possible for example to make some notches on the beams so that the belts inserted in them clg.75 the beams at the desired length. Such a sistem make it possible to control the lateral tables, on the ground and in sailing as well, according to the wind force and direction and to the desired performan ces. A stout,plasticized service cloth 24 is also provided astern so as to permit and follow the movement of the. lateral tables still remaining stretched. This is possible thanks to the adjustable width of the cloth which is hooked to the three tables. Thus, using such ispirations makes it possible to produce boats either with a table beam suitable forgone or more persons sitting one next the other or with a table length suitable for two or more persons sitting one before the other further seat s with backboard s quite similar to the seat s 7 with backboards 8 is are to be provided. Constructive details can be modified in order to obtain more practicality in production without changing the inspi ration just as hereunder claimed.
