# Recovery of power from the vaporization of natural gas.

## Abstract
Power is recovered from the vaporization of liquefied natural gas by liquefying a multicomponent refrigerant. The liquefied multicomponent refrigerant is then pressurized, vaporized and expanded in two stages through two expan ders which are coupled to a generator.
