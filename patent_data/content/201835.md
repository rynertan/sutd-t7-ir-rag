# Charging electrodes bearing a semiconductor coating.

## Abstract
There is described an array of charging electrodes such as are used in ink jet printers. At least portions of the exposed surfaces of such electrodes, used to charge passing ink drops, are overcoated with a continuous coating substan tially free of cracks of a semiconductive material doped to have a resistance, at room temperature, when measured perpendicularly to the electrode array, of between 10⁸ and 10¹¹ ohms, such material being essentially insoluble in the ink.
