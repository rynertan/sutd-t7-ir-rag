# METHOD OF AND APPARATUS FOR SIZING AN OBJECT

## Abstract
A method of, and apparatus for sorting timber logs. The logs are clamped between jaws 126, 126 , on a linkage mechanism 118, 120 , suspended from an overhead con veyor 114, 202 . The jaw spacing is dependent on the log diameter. The linkage mechanism is coveyed past a number of gauges 216 and, when the log diameter corresponds to a gauge setting, a cam 228 is displaced to a position at which it acts on the linkage mechanism to cause the jaws to open and release the log.
