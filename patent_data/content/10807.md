## Description
Derivative5 of branched ain monocarboxylic acids, erlginc lubricating oils, lubricant comisositiolls for polymers, wax conposi tions in which these derivatives are incorporated and a process for preparing said branched chain monocarboxylic acids. The invention relates to derivatives of bratic ed chain monocarboxylic acids selected from the group consisting of al esters of phenols or aromatic, aliphatic or cycloaliphatic alcohols having at least 1 to 10 primary or secondary hydroxyl groups b amides of ammonia or of aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic amines having at least 1 to 15 primary or secondary amino groups c salts of alkali metals or alkaline earth metals, amphoteric metals, heavy metals of ammonium or of a compound containing a tertiary amino group and to engine lubricating oils whose base fluid entirely or partly consists of one or more of said derivatives, and to lubricant compositions for polymers entirely or partly made up of one or more of these derivatives, and to wax compositions in which one or more of these derivatives are incorporated and to a process for preparing said branched chain monocarboxylic acids.Derivatives of branched chain monocarboxylic acids are known to be used for various purposes. Esters of branched chain monocarboxylic acids are described in, inter alia, British Patent Specification 1 441 918. They are esters derived from a branched chain polyol such as pentaerythritol or trimethylol propane and a mixture of 5 to 90 mole of branched chain monocarboxylic acids having 13 to 22 carbon atoms and 95 to 10 mole of straight chain or branched chain monocarboxylic acids having 3 to 12 carbon atoms. These esters are said to be excellently suitable to be used in engine lubricating oils. Applicant has found, however, that for the lastmentioned use the known esters can be improved upon in several respects.This particularly applies to the pour point and the viscosity index. The present invention provides a new class of esters having a surprisingly low pour point and an extraordinarily good viscosity behaviour.Amide derivatives of carboxylic acids and alkylene polyamines or hydroxyalkyl substituted polyamines are described inter alia in United States PatentSpecification 3 163 603.The carboxylic acid described in it is a dicarboxylic acid, viz. a hydrocarbon substituted succinic acid. The hydrocarbon group contains at least 50 carbon atoms. Although these products are satisfactorily dispersing agents, corrosion inhibitors and or acid tinders, there is yet a great need for products having similar properties, but improved solubility and improved rheological behaviour in mineral oils. The use of salts of the abovementioned type and of mixtures of salts and esters of, in particular, higher fatty acids in lubricant compositions for polymers is described in, inter alia, the United States Patent Specification 4 029 682. Applicant has found that lubricant compositions of a remarkably better quality are obtained if they are prepared from acids having a product composition which totally differs from the one described in said patent specification.Esters of branched chain and straight chain high molecular weight aliphatic monocarboxylic acids together with unesterified acids and or salts soaps thereof often form part of synthetic wax compositions. It has now been found that incorporation into wax compositions of derivatives according to the present invention leads to waxes which display greatly improved properties for a very large number of uses thereof.The present invention provides a novel class of derivatives of branchedchain monocarboxylic acids having surprisingly good properties for the above mentioned uses. The present invention consists in that the derivatives of the types mentioned in the opening paragraph are prepared from at least one acid of the formula EMI2.1 where x 0, if y 2 or x 2, if y 0R CH3 CH2 ,, where n represents an integer of from 3 to 42 b 0 or 1, where, if b O, Q represents a hydrogen atom, and if b 1, Q represents a CH2 group, and a 0 or 1, where if a 0, Z represents a hydrogen atom, and if a 1, Z represents a CH2 group. The acids of the above mentioned formula can be obtained 1,y reacting an a olefin having 6 to 45 carbon atoms with acetic anhydride at a temperature in the range of 1000 to 1400C in the presence of a catalytic amount of an at least trivalent manganese compound. The a olefin may consist of a pure olefin fraction, such as 1 octene, or of a mixture of a olefins having 6 to 45 carbon atoms. If use is made of a mixture of a olefins, then the nunber for n in each separate R radical may, independently of the other R radicals in the firstmentioned structural formula of the acid, assume any value equal to the number of carbon atoms minus two of an a olefin present in the mixture.The most favourable results are generally obtained at a reaction temperature in the range of 1150 to 1250C in the presence of manganic acetate as initiator.To prevent oxidation of the substrate the concentration of the manganic acetate is preferably chosen between 10 3 and 10 10 moles per liter. The concentration of the olefin fraction is dependent on the desired percentage of branched chain monocarboxylic acids in the reaction product, which percentage is partly determined by the olefin starting fraction.If use is made of an olefin starting fraction having not more than 20 carbon atoms, it is preferred in view of the above described field of application that use should be made of a relatively high percentage of branched chain acids. If, however, use is made of an olefin fraction having 20 to 45 carbon atoms, then more preference is found to be given to a mixture of monocarboxylic acids containing at least 70 by weight of the addition product of 1 mole of olefin to 1 mole of acetic acid.In all cases the reaction conditions will be so chosen that at least 10 by weight of the branched chain acids conforms to the above mentioned structural formula. It should be added that also the United States Patent Specifications 3 988 330, 4 012 357 and 4 029 682 mention is made of an addition reaction of a olefins with a monocarboxylic acid under the influence of a radical initiator. The olefins always contain 22 or more carbon atoms. The reaction is carried out in the presence of a propionic acid or a higher carboxylic acid as solvent and inorganic or organic peroxide.as radical initiator. Upon termination of the reaction the addition product is estorified with mono and or polyfunctional alcohols. A disadvantage to this process consists in that the conversion of the addition reaction is not higher than about 50 to 70 , which results in a higher percentage of olefin fraction in the endproduct which cannot be separated from it on a commercial scale. The resulting telomeric monocarboxylic acids not only strongly differ from the derivatives according to the invention as far as structure is concerned exclusively a branching but also their product distribution is entirely different. For the preparation of branched chain monocarboxylic acids according to the first mentioned formula, use is made of a molar ratio of converted olefin to manganic acetate of at least 4. It has been found that under these last mentioned conditions the by weight composition of the mixture of telomeric acids is for n 4 17 only dependent on the molar ratio of a olefin to manganic acetate and the concentration of a olefin during the reaction.With a monocarboxylic acid obtained by reacting one a olefin with acetic acid being indicated by R1, a monocarboxylic acid obtained by reacting two a olefins by R2, a monocarboxylic acid obtained by reacting three olefins by R3, etc., it is found that respectively before and after removal of the R1 fraction the following is a typical example of a weight distribution that may be obtained. before distillation after distillation weight weight R1 30,7 0,3 R2 20,4 19,8R3 21,4 33,6R4. 13,0 21,5 9,4 15,9 5,1 8,8 The structural formulae of R3, R4 and R5 all correspond to the first mentioned formula. R1 is an unbranched acid of the formula R CH2 3 COOH and for the above mentioned reasons it is preferably removed from the reaction mixture in the case of esterification with an aliphatic alcohol having only one primary hydroxyl group. It will be obvious that in the case of esterification with a polyol R1 also can partly be removed from the reaction mixture for instance by distillation.The 1 fraction is formed by two acids of the formula EMI5.1 To a man skilled in the art it is obvious that especially when use is made of an olefin starting fraction having 30 or more carbon atoms, it is not possible in actual practice to separate the linear acids from the acids having a very high molecular weight and a high degree of telomerization.It has been found that the use of mixtures of derivatives of these branchedchain and linear carboxylic acids in polymers, wax compositions, etc., employed for all the above mentioned purposes lead to compositions. having unexpectedly favourable properties, which remarkably favourably compare with the known compositions that only contain derivatives of straight chain fatty acids.The following is a typical example of a weight distribution of monocarboxylic acids obtained from a C30 olefin mixture.degree of telomerization m weight m 1 78,0 m. 2 6,3 m 3 6,5 m 4 4,0 m 5. 3,1 m ,6 2,0 rl he comnercially available olefin fractions having 20 to 45 carbon atom are found to contain 60 to 80 by weight of a olefins and for the rest predominantly consist of vinylidene compounds. The resulting carboxylic acids are y branched moliocarboxylic acids, with. the acid having the formulaEMI6.1 where R1 and R2 represent linear alkyl groups which together have the same number of carbon atoms as the group R. Separation of these vinylidene groups containing fractions from the a olefins would give rise to so many technological problems that it must be considered impracticable for economic reasons. It has been found, however, that for most uses products having exceptionally good properties are obtained if besides the derivatives prepared from the branched chain acids of the above formulae 40 to 60 per cent by weight of the derivatives is prepared from linear aliphatic monocarboxylic acids, with the acid having the formula RCH2CH 2CH2COOH, where R represents a CH3 CM2 group with n representing an n integer from 17 to 42. The proportion of derivatives of y branched carboxylic acids, with the acid having the formula EMI6.2 where R1 and R2 represent linear alkyl groups which together have the same number of carbon atoms as the group R, will vary between 30 and 40 per cent by weight. It has been found that for the preparation of lubricant compositions for engine oils, and internal and external lubricants for polymers and lubricants used in the manufacture of textile materials use may with advantage be made of derivatives of branched chain acids according to the invention, where n represents an integer from 3 to 17.For the preparation of components in synthetic wax compositions it is preferred to make use of derivatives of branched chain acids of the firstmentioned formula where n represents an integer in the range of 17 to 42.When the lubricant compositions are to be used for engine oils, it is preferred that use should be made of aliphatic esters of branched chain acids of the first mentioned formula, where n represents an integer of fror,l 3 to 11. As additional advantage thereof may be mention xl that they have a relatively high average molecular weight, as a rer alt of which the loss of weight of a lubricating oil having in the base fluid the esters according to the invention compares extremely favourably with the 5 oam lubricating oils derived from synthetic esters. In view of the high thermal resistance, the high viscosity index and resistance to oxidation of the esters according to the invention there will be need for fewer or less costly additives, which may greatly influence the final price of the finished product. For use in engine lubricating oils it is preferred according to the invention to employ esters derived from an aliphatic alcohol having 1 to 18 carbon atoms. This may be a monofunctional alcohol such as n butanol or a polyfunctional alcohol. The former has the advantage that the esterification proceeds at a higher speed and without further great difficulties. In the case of polyfunctional alcohols, however, higher molecular and even less volatile products may. be obtained. Particularly attractive esters are found to be produced if the aliphatic alcohol is a branched chain polyalcohol having 2 to 4 primary hydroxyl groups. In this connection mention is made of the favourable properties of esters of which the aliphatic polyalcohol is neopentyl glycol. Other esters having particularly good properties are obtained by using trimethylol ethane or dipentaerythritol. In view of their high thermal stability, preference is given to esters derived from such aliphatic polyalcohols as trimethylol propane or pentaerythritol.For the preparation of diesters of acids having the first mentioned formula it is of advantage to make use of the epoxides instead of the corresponding alcohols. Particularly if instead of the telomeric acids the corresponding anhydrides are used, the reaction in the presence of 1 mole per cent of a tetraalkyl ammonium bromide such as tetrabutyl ammonium bromide proceeds very rapidly. It will be evident that in the esterification use may be made of pure telomeric acids or of a mixture thereof with other acids, such as acetic acid, lauric acid or oleic acid. As examples of suitable epoxides for the preparation of diesters may be mentioned ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, the epoxides derived from a olefins having 3 to 45 carbon atoms, the epoxides derived from other unsaturated alkenes, esters of 2,3 epoxy 1 propanol, epoxidized natural oils, such as epoxidized soy bean oil, cyclic epoxides and di epoxides. In addition to being suitable for the prQt arntion i dicsters, the epo es may be used for tlle preparation of esters having a high hydroxyl number. It has becn fol d that many of the derivatives according to the present invention with n representing an integer from 3 to i7 provide liquid lubricant formulations.Especially the highly branched derivatives show an external lubricating effect and an unexpected degree of clarity in PVC compositions. Suitable phenols that may be used for the preparation of the ester derivatives according to the invention include phenol, cresol, xylenol, mesitol, durenol, thymol, naphthol, resorcinol, hydroquinone, bisphenols such as 4,4 1oxydiphenol, 4,4 isopropylidene diphenol, 4,4 methylene diphenol and biphenyi 4,4 diol. They may optionally be substi tuted with, for instance, alkyl or alkoxy groups or halogen.Suitable aromatic hydroxyl compounds i nclude benzyl alcohol, tolyl alcohol methylphenyl carbinol , phenethyl alcohol, salicyl alcohol, 2 naphthalene ethanol, phenylpropyl alcohol and cinnamyl alcohol. Suitable aliphatic or cycloaliphatic alcohols include monohydric alcohols, di en higher polyhydric alcohols and ether alcohols, which may be mono or polyfunctional. Optionally, they may contain ethylenically unsaturated groups or other substituents, such as alkyl, alkoxy, halogen or heterocyclic groups such as in furfuryl alcohol. They may contain 1 to 60 or more carbon atoms.Suitable ester derivatives are obtained by making use of methanol, ethanol, n propanol, isopropanol, n butanol, t butanol, iso amylalcohol, n hexanol, cyclohexanol, 2 cyclohexene 1 ol, 2 ethylhexanol, n octanol, isodecanol, capryl alcohol, lauryl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol and oxo alcohols such as tridecyl alcohol, which substantially consists of tetramethyl 1 nonanol and hexadecyl alcohol which is made up of a composite mixture of primary alcohols and may be characterized as 2,2 dialkyl ethanols in which the alkyl groups substantially consist of methyl branched C6 and C8 radicals.As examples of aliphatic polyols suitable to be used for the preparation of the ester derivatives may be mentioned ethylene glycol, 1,2 propylene glycol, 1,3 propylene glycol, 1,2 butanediol, 1,4 butanediol, 1,5 pentanediol, 3 methyl 1,5 pentane diol, 3 methyl 1,5 pentane diol, 2,3 dimethyl2,3 butanediol, trimethylol propane, mannitol, sorbitol, glycerol and pentaerythritol. The preparation of the novel ester derivatives according to the invention also may be carried out with the use of ether alcohols. The ether alcohols may be moiiofunctional or polyfu cLional and con Ld in 2 to 8 condenc cd polyol units. Suitable ether alct hol.s include diethylene glycol triethylenee glycol, tetraethylene glycol diethytene glycol monomethyl ether, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, triethylene glycol monomethyl ether, butoxyethanol, butylene glycol monobutyl ether, dipentaerythritol, tripentaerythritol, tetrapenteerythritol, diglycerol, tetraglycerol, pentaglycerol, hexaglycerol, heptaglycerol and octaglycerol.Also suitable compounds have been found to be mono or diesters of the polyalkylene oxide glycols having 2 to 50 alkylene oxide units each containing 2 to 4 carbon atoms. Examples thereof include polyethylene oxide glycol having a molecular weight of 500 to 2000 and polytetrahydrofuran having a molecular weight of 600 to 2000. For use as lubricant in polymers or resin compositions not all free hydroxyl groups need be esterified. Also partially esterified polyols are within the scope of the present invention. It is preferred that at least 50 of the available hydroxyl groups are converted into esters. The esters of the present invention are also suitable to be used as dispersant in lubricating oils. Especially the equimolar reaction products of the acids according to the first mentioned formula and pentaerythritol and or trimethylol propane can very effectively be used for the above mentioned purpose.It has been found that resin compositions having remarkably good lubricating properties are obtained if use is made of esters of aliphatic polyols and ether polyols having 2 to 12 carbon atoms and 2 to 8 primary or secondary hydroxyl groups. Special mention should be made in this respect of esters derived from ethylene glycol, neopentyl glycol, pentaerythritol, dipentaerythritol, tripentaerythritol, glycerol, and or di , tri , and or tetraglycerol. The acid number of these esters is preferably lower than 30 and the hydroxyl number lower than 40. It will be clear that also mixtures of esters derived from at least one acid of the first mentioned formula and some other branched or non branched acid may be suitable for use in polymer and or engine lubricating compositions according to the invention In the preparation of the acids of the first mentioned formula also other branched and non branched fatty acids are obtained. It has been found that the presence of esters derived from a polyol having at least 2 to 10 primary or secondary hydroxyl groups, at least one branched chain acid having the first mentioned formula and a branched acid havinq the formula EMI10.1 and or EMI10.2 where R has the same meaning as in the first mentioned formula, leads to obtaining products having particularly good lubricating properties.Besides, it has been found that also esters derived from a polyol having at least 2 to 10 primary or secondary hydroxyl groups, at least one branched chain acid of the first mentioned formula and an unbranched aliphatic monocarboxylic acid having 7 to 47 carbon atoms are very suitable for use in polymer and or engine lubricating compositions according to the invention.What has been said above about the esters of polyalcohols applies, mutatis mutandis, to all derivatives of the present invention prepared from a polyfunctional compound such as a polyamine or a polyisocyanate. It will further be clear that not only the derivatives of the monocarboxylic acids of the first mentioned formula and monofunctional alcohols, amines, isocyanates and the like, but also mixtures containing derivatives of other branched or non branched monocarboxylic acids may be used for one of the above mentioned purposes. For a man skilled in the art it will not be difficult, on the basis of the physical properties of the separate properties, to establish whether or not it is possible to use mixtures also containing derivatives of other branched or non branched monocarboxylic acids. The preparation of the acids according to the present invention also leads to the formation of straight chain aliphatic carboxylic acids. It has been found that for a large number of uses they need not be removed from the mixture.It should be added that the use in lubricating oils of esters derived from a monofunctional alcohol and an unbranched aliphatic monocarboxylic acid having 2 or more carbon atoms should as much as possible be avoided both because of their relatively high volatility and their tendency to increase the pour point. The esters according to the invention are prepared by esterifying an alcohol or a mixture of alcohols in a manner known in itself, in which process per alcohol at least one branched chain acid of the first mentioned formula is present. As indicated above, also other branched or non branched acids may be present. The esterification reaction may be carried out in the usual manner. The reaction mixture is heated to a temperature of 1000 to 3000C in the presence or not of a catalyst, the water evolved in the reaction being discharged. The esterification is usually carried out at a temperature in the range of 1400 to 2800C. Optionally, use may be made of an esterification catalyst.This may he an acid such as sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, alkylsulphonic acids and arylsulphonic acids such as p toluene sulpllollic acid and methane sulphonic acid and a variety of natal compounds such us dibutyl tin oxide, tctrabutyl titanate, zinc acetate, stannooxalate, iron oxide, ferristearate, ma cjanostear.at.e, cobalt Il stearate and manganoacetatc. The catalyst is usually employed in an amount of 0,1 to lt by weight, based on the reaction mixture. Optionally, use may be made of an inert thinner which together with water forms an azeotrope, such as benzene, toluene or xylene.In the process use is generally made of stoichiometric amounts of acid and alcohol, although in the esterification with the more volatile alcohols the latter also may be used in excess. By the end of the reaction the excess is removed from the reaction mixture by distillation.Esterification may take place at atmospheric pressure, but it is also possible to have it carried out at reduced pressure 2 50 mm Hg . Under such conditions the excess alcohol and water can readily be removed upon completion of the reaction. The resulting esters can as a rule directly be used for one of the above purposes. Under some circumstances, however, it may be advisable also to apply a purification step, for in stance by treating the compositions with bleaching earth, ozone, peroxide, hyprochlorite or some other suitable bleaching agent. The preparation also may include a treatment with active carbon.The esters derived from aliphatic monoalcohols having t to 8 carbon atoms and a mono carboxylic acid of the first mentioned formula, where n 3 to 9, may be purified for instance by distillation. For use in engine lubricating oils the final acid number should be lower than 0,2,and the hydroxyl number lower than 10.Besides the above mentioned esters also soaps salts and mixtures of esters and soaps ester soaps prepared from an acid according to the first mentioned formula are excellently suitable to be used in lubricating compositions of, more particularly, polyvinyl chloride and copolymers thereof and in lubricating oils. Useful soaps and ester soaps prepared from the above described higher molecular weight acids include those obtained using alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, amphoteric metals and heavy metals.Illustrative metals include lithium, sodium, potassium, beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, copper, silver, zinc, cadmium, mercury, aluminium, iron, nickel, cobalt and the like. Especially useful metallic soaps for use in polymers are prepared from the metals of lithium, calcium, barium, magnesium, zinc, lead, cadmium or tin and mixtures thereof. For use in lubric lting oils preference is given to soaps prepared from the acids according to the first mentioned formula, where n represents an integer of 20.Especially preferred are the salts prepared from a metal selected from the group of calcium, barium and magnesium.In lubricant conr ositions for engine oils or polymers, particularly polyvinyl chloride, use may be made of overbased formulations comprising one or more of the above salts.Examples of processes according to which the overbased formulations dispersions may he prepared are described in U.S. Patents 2 585 520, 2 739 124, 2 889 279, 2 895 913, 3 149 074, 3 150 089, 3 235 494 and 3 629 109. Metal coIii c nts of resins containil u these products may range troll low levels, about 0,1 weight with certain ester soaps, to as high as 15 t. or more for overbased formulations with the soaps of some of the heavier metals. The salts soaps are prepared in a known manner by the wet route of precipitation or by the dry route of melting. The preparation of the insoluble soaps derived from lower olefins may be effected by a double decomposition reaction in which first the acid is dissolved in hot water and subsequently neutralized with a sodium hydroxide solution in order to obtain the soluble sodium salt. Next, a solution of the respective heavy metal is slowly added with stirring.The insoluble metal salt instantaneously precipitates from the solution and is isolated there from by filtration.This reaction is usually carried out at a temperature in the range of 500 to 90 C and can only be applied in the preparation of soaps that give a watersoluble sodium salt. This is generally the case if n 3 to 7.In the preparation of the soaps use will generally be made of the direct procedure of heating the acid in the presence of a metal oxide, hydroxide or weakly acid salt.Mixtures of esters and soaps are obtained by partial saponification of the acid, that is by reacting the carboxyl groups of the branched chain acids with a metal compound and an aliphatic hydroxyl compound having 1 to 40, and preferably 1 to 12 carbon atoms and 1 to 10 primary or secondary hydroxyl groups. The reaction of the metal compound and the aliphatic hydroxyl compound with a mixture of the high molecular weight monocarboxylic acids may be carried out stepwise or in a single step. The monocarboxylic acids may first be contacted with the desired amount of metal compound in order partially to neutralize the acid and subsequently esterifying the remaining carboxyl groups by reaction with the hydroxyl compound. Alternatively, first a part of the carboxyl groups may be esterified and the remaining part of the carboxyl groups be neutralized with the metal compound. It is preferred, however, to apply the single step procedure.Esterification is effected under the same conditions as given above for the preparation of pure esters.Not only salts of metals and tertiary amines such as triethylamine, pyridine and quinoline, but also amides of ammonia or of aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic amines and a branched chain acid of the first mentioned formtllii are exccel ently suitable for use in lu jricatin oils or to re place the known amid waxes. Suitab e amine from which the amides are derived include methylamine, ethylene diamine, butylamine, hexamethylene 1,6 diamine, p phenylene diawine and 1 , 4 cyclohexyl diamine, methylethyl amine and 2 N methyl asino heptane. Also suitable for use are substituted ansines, such as ethanol amine and butanol amine.The amides of the present invention are not only suitable for use as dispersing agents, corrosion inhibitors and or acid binders in lubricant conìpositions. It has been found that they lend themselves excellently to being employed as curing catalyst for epoxy resins. In addition, mention should he made of their use as surface active compound.For use in lubricating oils preference is given to amide derivatives of acids of the first ,mentioned formula, where nazis an integer of from 3 to 23. Particularly it is considered that use should be made of amide derivatives of alkylene polyamines or hydroxyalkyl substituted polyamines. Over the compounds described in the prior art such as U.S. Patent Specification 3 163 603 they have the advantage of improved solubility and improved rheological behaviour in mineral oils. They readily mix with mineral oil fractions which are usually employed as base fluid in lubricating compositions.It has been found that for most uses products having attractive properties are obtained, if the polyamine from which the amides are derived corresponds to the formula EMI14.1 where n represents an integer of from 1 tot 10, A is a hydrogen atom or a hydrocarbon group substituted or not with an amino group, and the alkylene group is a lower alkylene group having not more than 8 carbon atoms. Preference is especially given to ethylene diamine and the oligomers thereof.As examples of other polyamines may be mentioned the following compounds or higher. homologues thereof propylene diamine, decamethylene diamine, octamethylene diamine, di heptamethylene triamine, tripropylene tetramine, trimethylene diamine, di trimethylenej triamine, 2 heptyl 3 2 aminopropyl imidazoline, 1,3bis 2 aminoethyl imidazoline, pyrimidine, 1 2 aminopropyl piperazine, 1,4 bis 2 aminoethyl piperazine and 2 methyl 1 2 aminobutyl piperazine. Preference is generally giveli to amides derived ire dicthylene tridlllirle, triethylene tetramine, tetraethylene pentalnine and pentaet 0yle1 e hc, a mine. The higher homologues may of course, be composed of only one mono mer, or of fixtures of two or more diamines. Other amides having exceptionally favourable properties are obtained if tne amides are derived fro aminoethyl piperazine. The hydroxyalkyl substituted polyamines from which the amides according to the present invention may be derived are generally alkylene polyam.3ne having one or more hydroxyalkyl substituents on a nitrogen atom. The alkyl group of hydroxyalkyl substituted polyamines generally has not more than 6 carbon atoms. Examples of such amines include N 2 hydroxyethyl ethylene diamine, N,N bis 2 hydroxyethyl ethylene diamine, t 2 hydroxyethyl piperazine, hydroxypropyl substituted diethylene triamine, di hydroxHpropyl substituted tetraethylene pentamine, andN 3 hydroxypropyl tetramethylene diamine.Other useful amide derivatives are the hydroxyalkyl substituted alkylene amines obtained by condensation of the above mentioned alkylene amines through amino groups or hydroxyl groups.Condensation through the amino groups with NR3 being split off results in a higher polyamine, and condensation through the hydroxyl groups results in products containing ether linkages.The amide derivatives according to the present invention may be prepared from a pure carboxylic acid or a mixture of carboxylic acid according to the first mentioned formula or from the homoanhydrides or mixed anhydrides thereof. At least about one equivalent of one of the above mentioned anines is added, with the mixture being heated and the water formed being removed. The acylation reaction may be carried out at a temperature within the range of 200 to 2500 C. It is preferred that the reaction be carried out at a temperature within the range of 0 0 about 80 to 230 C over a period of from about 3 to 5 hours.Particularly when the present amide derivatives are used in mineral oils the preparation of the amides also may be carried out in said mineral oil..The reaction temperature generally varies between 1000 and 2000 C.During the reaction, which usually lasts 3 to 7 hours, nitrogen is passed through. After cooling and filtration generally. a clear solution is obtained. Wnen the amide derivatives of the present invention are used in lubricant compositions often also metal salts of carboxylic acids are incorporated into these compositions. The molar ratio of amide to metal soap will as a rule be about 1 1 then. In that case it case is recoended to use as starting material the anhydrides of the carboxyl acids according to the first mentioned formula, to amidate these and subsecuently to react the reaction product with a metal salt or metal oxide In this last mentioned case the reaction is advantageously carried out in the presence of a small amount of water of up to 2,5 by weight of the reaction mixture.Suitable metals from which the oxid es or salts may be derived are alkali metals alkaline earth metals, zinc, cadmium and or lead. Instea of the salts or oxides of said metals hydroxides, carbonates or lower alcoh6lates may be used.The resulting reaction mixture is heated to a temperature in the range of 200 to 2500 C, and preferably 800 to 2300 C.It will be obvious that besides the carboxylic acids that correspond to the above mentioned structural formula carboxylic acids having a somewhat different structure may be present. Tne proportion in which they may be present is governed on the one hand by technical price and production factors and on the other by the demands made on the endproduct.Thus, in the preparation of the acids according to the first mentioned formula also other branched and unbranched acids are obtained.Particularly the presence of the branched acids of the formulaEMI16.1 and orEMI16.2 where R has the same meaning as in the first mentioned formula, is found to lead to amide derivatives which excellently mix with mineral oil fractions.Instead of by the abpve preparation by a direct reaction of the amine with the acid, the anhydride or the ester the preparation may be carried out by first converting the acid in the acid chloride with,for instance, thionyl chloride or phosphorus trichloride or phosphorus pentachloride, after which the acid chloride is added to the amine in the presence of a base such as an aqueous sodium hydroxide solution or pyridine. Another attractive method of preparing the amides of the branched chain acids according to the first mentioned formula is characterized by direct reaction of the acid or mixture of acids and the equivalent amount of 1 or more isocyanate groups containing compounds or mixtures thereof. The use of isocyanate groups containing compounds instead of the amino groups containing compounds has the additional advantage that the reaction proceeds at a higher speed and as byproduct only the readily isolated carbon dioxide is formed. An important advalltage of the novel nlaiife compounds according to the present invention over the known compounds described in, for instance, the German Patent Specification 2 460 235 inter alia consists in the higher solvent retention. Moreover, when incorporated into rubber or polymers, the novel products according to the invention will less readily exude therefrom.Further, they are excellently suitable to be applied as paper sizing agent, and for increasing the dropping point of paraffin waxes and asphalt and decreasing the viscosity of adhesives. The isocyanates to be used in the preparation of the present compounds niay be of an aliphatic or aromatic character. If few or no coloured products are desired, then it is preferred to use aliphatic isocyanates.Preference is further given to isocyanates of the general formula A R1 NCO, where R1 represents a cyclo aliphatic hydrocarbon having at least 6 carbon atoms, a phenyl group or naphthyl group, which groups may be substituted or not with one or more lower alkyl groups having 1 to 8, and preferably 1 to 6 carbon atoms, lower alkoxy groups having 1 to 8, and preferably 1 to 6 carbon atoms, aryl, for instance phenyl, and halogen such as chlorine or bromine, and A represents a NCO group, or a R2 cos2 R3 NCO n R4 NCO group, where R2 has the meaning of a simple bond or an aliphatic hydrocarbon group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, n is equal to 0 or higher, andR3 and R4 may be the same or different and may or may not have the same meaning as R1. As examples of suitable monoisocyanates may be mentioned ethyl isocyanate, hexyl isocyanate, 2 ethylhexyl isocyanate, butyl isocyanate, stearyl isocyanate. As examples of diisocyanates which can be defined by the formula OCNRNCO, where R represents a divalent aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic group, may be mentioned hexamethylene diisocyanate dimethyl hexamethylene diisocyanate trimethyl hexamethylene diisocyanate metaxylylene diisocyanate paraxylylene diisocyanate tetramethylene diisocyanate.In the case where R represents an aromatic group, it may be substituted with a halogen, a lower alkyl or a lower alkoxy group.As examples of such diisocyanates may be mentioned 1 chloro 2 ,4 phenylene diisocyanate 2,4 toluene diisocyanate a mixture of 2,4 toluonc. diisocyanate and 2,6 toluenc diisocyanate tetramethy Iphonylene diisocyanate diphenylmethane 4,4 diisocyanate metaphenylene diisocydnate paraphenylene diisocyanate 1, 5 nap3ithalene diisocyanate biphenyl 4,4 diisocyanate diphenylmethane 4,4 diisocyanate 4,4 isopropylidene diphenyl isocyanate benzophenone 4,4 diisocyanate diphenylether diisocyanate or diphenylsulphide diisocyanate 3,3 dimethyldiphenyl 4,4 diisocyanate 3,3 dimethoxydiphenyl 4,4 diisocyanate 3,3 dichlorodiphenyl 4 4 diisocyanate benzofuran 2,7 diisocyanate. Examples of diisocyanates having a cycloaliphatic group include isophoron diisocyanate, dicyclohexyl methane diisocyanate and 1,4 cyclohexane diisocyanate. The temperature at which the reaction takes place between the monocarboxylic acid and the isocyanate should be established experimentally. It will generally be in the range of 400 to 2500C. The reaction can be followed by the amount of carbon dioxide evolved in the process.The above described amides are especially suitable to be incorporated as lubricants in styrene acrylonitrile butadiene copolymers.By styrene acrylonitrile butadiene ABS copolymers are to be understood here the conventional ABS plastics which are composed of styrene acrylonitrile copolymers as a continuous phase and a dispersed phase of butadiene acrylo nitrile rubber, or a butadiene containing rubber onto which styrene acrylonitrile monomers are grafted.The lubricants may be incorporated into the ABS copolymers in the usual manner. This may be done by milling at temperatures between 1300 and 1600C. The lubricant may be added along with other ingredients, or separately. The above amides are further suitable to be used along with the other derivatives of the present invention in polyvinyl chloride or copolymers of polyvinyl chloride.By polyvinyl chloride and copolymers of polyvinyl chloride are to be understood here all possible types of homopolymers of vinyl chloride and post chlorinated polyvinyl chloride, and also copolymers with vinyl chloride as the most important constituent and a small amount of other co polymerizable monomers, such as copolymers of vinyl chloride and vinyl acetate, copolymers of vinyl chloride and vinylidene chloride, copolymers of vinyl chloride and acrylonitrile, copolymers of vinyl chloride and maleic or fumaric esters and copoly. .ers of vinyl chloride and styrene, and also mixtures containing a high percentage of polyvinyl chloride resin and a small percentage of some other synthetic resin, such as chlorinated polyethylene, copolymers of acrylonitrile, butadiene and styrene. The lubricants may be incorporated into the polyvinyl chloride or copolymers thereof in the usual manner. This may be done by mixing on a roll or in a mixer of the Banbury type.Alternatively, tile lubricant may be dissolved or dispersed in some appropriate solvent. The lubricant may be added along with other composition ingredients such as stabilizers, fillers and plasticizers, or in a separate step. The physical properties of the formulated resin composition may be considerably varied by changing the amount and the nature of the constituents to be incorporated therein without detracting from the lubricating properties of the present lubricants.For a man skilled in the art it will generally not be difficult to find the most suitable percentage for obtaining an optimum effect for each use envisaged. In a number of cases it will be possible for the derivatives according to the present invention to be used as such, i.e. without admixing other known polymer and or engine lubricating agents, but generally it will be preferred that other products should be admixed in order to obtain more favourable physical and or chemical properties. In this con nection special mention should be made of wax compositions that substantially consist of a mixture of branched chain or straight chain acids and derivatives according to the present invention. The invention is further described in, but not limited by the following examples.Example I A slurry made up of 17,4 g of manganese III acetate in 100 ml of acetic anhydride and 84 g 0,6 moles of 1 decene was slowly added, with stirring, over a period of 1,5 to 5 hours in an atmosphere of nitrogen, to a previously provided mixture of 900 ml 9,5 moles of acetic anhydride and 42 g 0,3 moles of 1 decene. The reaction temperature was 1250C, and the stirring speed 800 revolutions per minute. Upon completion of the reaction the mixture was cooled to room temperature and filtered to remove the manganese II acetate formed. Subsequently, acetic anhydride, acetic acid formed and unconverted 1 decenewere distilled off.To the residue there were added 200 ml of acetic acid and 25 ml of water and the mixture was heater lor 1 liour to 300 C, with vigorous stirring. Then the acetic acid water mixture was distilled off, followed by removing theR1 fraction lanric acid in a rotary vacuum evaporator of the beybold KDJ. 4 type uDder the following conditions Sleeve temperature 1180C cold finger 250C mitering vessel 400C pressure 10 mm g feed rate 400 ml hour After distillation the telomeric acids had the following compositional analysis weight R1 0,3R2 19,8 R3 33,6R4 21,5 P5 15,9 R 6 8,8The acid number of the heavy fraction was found to be. 109,3.75 g of n butanol and 50 g of the resulting telomeric acids were intermixed, after which 1 g of manganese II acetate was added to the mixture.After 4 hours heating at 2800C in an autoclave under nitrogen the reaction mixture was cooled and the excess of n butanol distilled off. The residue was introduced into ether, after which the catalyst was washed out with water. Of the resulting ester mixture the most important propertès, such as the viscosity at different temperatures and the pour point in conformity with ASTM D 97 66 , were determined and compared with those of a few lubricating oils and or the base fluids thereof. The results are given in the following table.

The remaining olefin compounds were vinylidene compounds. The reaction was carried out in a stirred 700 r.p.m. reactor provided with 8 baffles and equipped with a stirrer having 6 diametrically opposed blades.Into this reaction vessel there were charged 12,5 litres 132 moles of acetic anhydride. The liquid was heated to 1200C while nitrogen was slowly passed through to remove the oxygen present in it. With the liquid being kept at 1200C, first of all the C30 olefin mixture was added. Of this mixture in all 1175 g 2,5 moles were added over a period of 210 minutes. 12 minutes after a start had been made with adding olefin a slurry of 0,625 moles M j III acetate in 2,5 1 acetic anhydride was added over a period of 21G minutes so for a period of 18 minutes after the last of the olefji had been added addition of Mn III acetate was continued to ensure com plete conversion of the olefin .The mixture was slbsequcrltly filtered to remove the Mn Il acetate that had formed. Next, acetic anhydride and the acetic acid formed were re moved by distillation. To the residue there were added 2,5 1 acetic acid and 0,3 1 water. With vigorous stirring the mixture was boiled with r ,f ux ing to hydrolyse the obtained anhydrides. Finally, the water acetic acid layer was separated off, the product washed 3 times with hot water and dried.The resulting mixture of straight chain and branched chain acids had an acid number of 86 and was esterified under an atmosphere of nitrogen with equivalent amounts of suitable alcohols.In the esterification with ethylene glycol the following procedure was used.To 300 grammes of the above described mixture of melted acids there were added 1,05 equivalents of ethylene glycol and 0,6 grammes of zinc acetate. The mixture was stirred at 190 C and the water evolved was carried off by a nitrogen stream. After 5 hours the remaining water and alcohol were removed under reduced pressure 14 mm Hg .A similar procedure was used for the preparation of the ethylene glycol ester of a C22 26 acid. Further a mixture was prepared of the ethylene glycol ester of a C30 acid and the calcium soap thereof.The resulting products were tested in a PVC formulation of the following composition PVc suspension polymer 100 Tribasic lead sulphate 2 Lubricant 0,1 0,5Each formulation was intensively mixed on a Papenmeier mixer.

The mixture was stirred at 1900C and the water evolved was carried off by a nitrogen stream. After 5 hours the remaining water and alcohol were removed under reduced pressure 14 mm Hg . The solidi fication point of the resulting tetra ester was 77 C. The acid number was 10,3 the hydroxyl number was between 2 and 5. A similar procedure was used for the preparation of ethylene glycol ester and 1,3 butanediol ester. The 1,3 butanediol ester was mixed with 40 by weight calcium soap. On the resulting products the following properties were measured C 1. Ubbelohde dropping point C heating rate 1 C min. which is a measure of the melting point of the wax composition.

As emulgator there was used the combination oleic acid amine. Examples of suitable amines include morpholine or 2 amino 2 methylpropanol. The emulsion was prepared by adding 5 grammes of morpholine to a melted mixture made up of 30 g of wax and 6 g of oleic acid at a temperature of 980C and the mixture was stirred for 3 4 minutes. Subsequently, 20 g of boiling water were added over a period of i minutes while increasing the stirring speed to 2000 revolutions per minute, which speed was maintained for 3 more minutes.Next, 180 g of boiling water were added over a period of 2 minutes, after which the mixture was rapidly cooled with an external ice bath and diluted with 60 g of cold water. The resulting emulsion was extraordinarily stable the particle size was in the order of 0,5 pm. Adding a polystyrene emulsion resulted in obtaining an excellent floor polish. The gloss obtained after drying bore comparison with that obtained after the use of a similar emulsion containing carnaubaprime yellow as wax component to which no polystyrene emulsion had been added. xv oil the way as indicated in Example XII for the esterificaLion of a mixture of C30 acids, 12,7 g of hexamethylelle diamine 1,05 equivale .ts were added to 300 g of melted acids. The mixture was stirred at 240 C and the water evolved was carried off by a stream of nitrogen After 5 hours the remaining volatile constituents were removed under reduced pressure 14 mm Hg . The acid number of the resulting reaction product was 4,2. In a similar way the amides were prepared from 4,4 diamino diphenylmethane and benzidine.

The esterification lasted 7 hours at 185 C and was carried out while passing through a stream of nitrogen. The resulting product had a dropping point of 73 0C and could be emulsified to a milk white emulsion.Example XIX In a similar way as used in the preceding example 200 g ofC30 acid were esterified with 92 g of polyethylene glycol average molecular weight 00 in tiio presence of 0,4 g of zine acetate. The resulting product a as a h ,d ester wax having a dropping point cL 89 c. It could readily be emulsified to a translucent wax emulsion.

The threeneck flask was provided with a Dean Stark receiver. During the reactionN2 was slowly passed through the mixture to remove the water formed.After 2 hours the reaction mixture was cooled. Ene product obtained was a low viscous, light coloured liquid, which was dissolved in a mineral oil which has a viscosity n 40 at 400 C of 31,4 centistokes and at 100 C of 5,41 centistokes. The Pour Point of this oil was 11 C. Viscosity measurements and Pour Point determinations on solutions containing 10,3 and 0,5 by weight of the amide, respectively, gave the following results Amide concentrations 40 100 wt C St C St Pour Point C 0 31,4 5,41 11 10, 36,6 5,68 11 3 32,9 5,49 10 0,5 31,5 5,34 13 Example XXI Starting from 1 decene a mixture of telomeric acids of the following weight distribution was obtained wt n i 3 n 2 22 n 3 30 n 4 21 n 5 15 The acid nu mDer of this telomeric acid mixture was 104.Of this mixture 100 g were mixed with 35,09 g of tetraethylene pentamine and heated to 230 C in the manner indicated in Example XX. The water removed with the aid of an N2 stream was measured with a Dean Stark receiver. After 2 hours the reaction was found to be terminated and the low viscous reaction mixture was dissolved in a mineral oil of the same type as indicated in Example XX. The rheological properties of these solutions are given in the table below.Amide concentration 40 100 wt C St C St Pour Point C 0 31,4 5,41 11 31,5 5,35 9 3 33,1 5,43 9 10 .35,3 5,83 9Example XXII The procedure of example XXI was repeated, but in such a way that the n 1 fraction was not removed. The mixture of telomeric acids had the following composition. wt n 1 32,1 n 2 21,2 n 3 21,9 n 4 14,4 n 5 10,3 The acid mu of this mixture of carboxylic acids was 170.Of this mixture 98,43 g were mixed with 56,12 g of tetraethylene pentanline and again heated to 230 C in the same way as indicated in Example XXI, The resulting low viscous, light coloured liquid Was dissolved in a mineral oil of the same type as mentioned in Example XXI.The rheolorgical properties of these solutions are given in the table below.

Further, the results are given of tests on the amide derivatives of tetraethylene pentamine and a TP total product based on octadecene TP18 C and a heavy telomeric acid fraction HTA18 based on the same olefin D , respectively.Viscosity measurements on solutions containing 3 and 10 by weight of the amide gave the following results Amide concentration 40 n 100 C st C st A 3 32,3 5,36 10 36,4 5,82 B 3 32,3 5,44 10 34,9 5,70 C 3 . 32,0 5,42 10 33,4 5,64 D 3 33,2 5,57 10 36,9 6,07 Example XXIV In this example it will be delnonstrated that also the salts of the tn, omel ic acids display a very remarkable viscosity behaviour in a mineral oil. The test procedure was similar to the one described in Example It the base fluid was a mineral oil of the type often used in engine oils a paraffinic commercial base fluid .The telomeric acids used were based on decene according to Example II and HTA67 HTA8, HTALO, HTA and HTA acid according to Example IX. 14 18The results are summarized in the following table below.EMI46.1 tb Telomeric SEP acid SEP metal SEP SEP SEP 40 SEP SEP SEP 100 SEP Pour SEP point tb SEP C SEP st SEP C SEP st SEP C SEP tb Acid SEP mixture SEP of tb Example SEP II SEP Ca SEP 36,16 SEP 5,98 SEP 12 tb Acid SEP mixture SEP of tb Example SEP II SEP Ba SEP 35,66 SEP 5,94 SEP 12 tb Acid SEP mixture SEP of tb Example SEP II SEP Li SEP 36,68 SEP 6,02 SEP 15 tb SEP HTA6 SEP Ca SEP 37,98 SEP 6,52 SEP 11 tb SEP HTA8 SEP Ca SEP 38,97 SEP 6,12 SEP 12 tb SEP HTA1o SEP SEP Ca SEP 38,93 SEP 6,17 SEP 13 tb SEP HTA14 SEP SEP Ca SEP 37,1 SEP 6,27 SEP 25 tb SEP HTA18 SEP Ca SEP 36,7 SEP 6,00 SEP SEP 3 tb base SEP oil SEP SEP 30,82 SEP 5,38 SEP 11 tb
