# Integrated logic circuit incorporating a module which generates a control signal that cancels switching noise.

## Abstract
A circuit having reduced susceptibility to noise includes a plurality of drivers coupled to a current bus each driver receives a logic signal on a control terminal and operates to pass a large current when the logic signal is a one and pass a small current when the logic signal is a zero the current bus has a parasitic inductance which generates a noise signal when the logic signals switch noise on the current bus is parasitically coupled to the control terminal of each driver and a plurality of noise reducing modules respectively couple to the control terminal of each driver and a common bus. Each module that receives a switching logic signal generates a control signal on the common bus that is similar in shape and opposite in polarity to the noise signal and each module that does not receive a switching logic signal couples the control signal from the common bus to the control terminal to which it is connected.
