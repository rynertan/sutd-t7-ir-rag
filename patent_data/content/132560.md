# A gun trigger mechanism.

## Abstract
A gun having a trigger mechanism comprising a pivotally mounted trigger 73 which is connected to rotate a pivotal sear and a reciprocal bolt carrier assembly having lugs 325 which are arranged to engage with the rear of the sear and a notch 717 in the top of the sear. Mounted on the pivotal axes of the trigger is a prop member 745 which is arranged to cooperate with an L shaped nose 720 of the sear so that when the trigger is pulled to rotate the sear in a first direction out of engagement with the lugs 325 the prop member 745 is initially prevented from moving with the trigger by the nose 720 and when the lugs are released by the sear the sear is further rotated in the first direction by the lugs contacting the upper sear surface to free the member to move toward the trigger and under the nose 720 . The prop member is the positioned under the nose 720 and thereby prevents the sear from rotating in a direction counter to said first direction until the trigger is released.
