# Non volatile semiconductor memory device having an improved write circuit.

## Abstract
A non volatile semiconductor device having an improv ed write voltage application circuit is disclosed. The memory device is of the type having a plurality of non volatile memory elements each coupled to a row line and a column line, a row selection circuit provided for each row line, the row selection circuit providing the row line with a selection potential when the row line is to be selected and a reference potential when the row line is not selected, and a write voltage application circuit provided for each row line for operatively applying a regulated amount of a write cur rent to the row line in a write state. The write voltage appli cation circuit includes a P channel MIS transistor which is adapted to take a conductive state of a large resistance at least in a write state, and a current flowing through the above P channel MIS transistor is derived as the regulated amount of the write current.
