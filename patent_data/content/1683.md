# A velocity dependent controlling device for the initiation of an actuator.

## Abstract
Where a production process requires that a work operation be performed on each article as it is moved through a work station, the actuation signal which commands the operation must be given before the article reaches the work station since there are delays in the response to the actuation signal. Furthermore, it is likely that the rate of movement of the articles will not be constant. The velocity dependent controlling device disclosed herein measures the velocity of an article being moved toward an apparatus which is to perform a work operation on the article. The controlling device then provides an actuation signal to the apparatus at an appropriate instant so that the actuator will have sufficient time to perform the work operation on the article as it is moved along. The actuation signal is produced by utilising the velocity measurement with a signal representative of the said delays as a result of sensing the arrival of an article at a predetermined position before the work station. An important application of the invention is in labelling apparatus 11 operating articles 45 moved by a conveyor 47 .
