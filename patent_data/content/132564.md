# Speech synthesizer.

## Abstract
A speech synthesizer of the type using a linear prediction coding and synthesis in sychrony with the pitch of the speech signal is described, in which the synthesis filter coefficients are updated at variable time intervals. The speech synthesizer is based on a three bus structure which permits device recon figuration in order to carry out test procedures, and on control circuits which permit, among other things, sampling fre quency selection, programmable de emphasis and effective initiation of operation which can be commanded from out side. The speech synthesizer also features a serial digital out put.
