## Description
mixing and Reaction Chamber for Liquid Decontamination The invention relates to a mixing and reaction chamber particularly suitable for effecting selective, stepwise treatment of a flowable, contaminated body of liquid therein. In our European Application No. 78300083.9, there is disclosed a process and apparatus for removing from a polar liquid such as water, a dissolved or suspended contaminant, thus obtaining a essentially pure liquid e.g. water and b sterile sludge. In. some instances, desired ingredients, such as precious metals, were recoverable from the sludge by fractionation.Typical feed stocks were municipal sewage and or industrial or agriculture waste water. lÇle illustrated apparatus consisted of sequentially flow connected units comprising a an aerating and macerating collection tank surge tank , b an acidifying chamber into which so2 is metered and mixed, c a submerged irJï bed containirlr tank which, in response to flow through of the acidic media, furnishes ferric errJus ions for oxidative reaction with the flow stream, d means for controlled admixture of air and alkaline reagent, e.g.NaOH orCa OH 2, into the stream, and e flocculation and solids separation means including pH control. Each segment of the monitored and flow controlled stream would.be retained in each successive unit for the required reaction or treatment time, and thereafter flow to the next unit thus when all segments of the stream were stepped forward simultaneously the residence time in each unit was essentially the same, namely it was the longest reaction time required in any unit. However, the treatment pattern exhibited some points of weakness when restricted to use of that apparatus. Thus, if the flow had to be suspended for correction of a local factor at any particular point along the line, the entire flow necessarily stopped.This could result in re establishment in the subsequent flow of some organisms, often reintroduced from the air, which had earlier been removed from the stream by the initial acid treatment step. The composite procedure which uses successive treatment by strong acid and then by strong alkali ensures elimination of all micro organisms those not eliminated by one reagent are eliminated by the other. However, when the two extremes of pH occur at opposite ends of a relatively long intermediate procedure, the problem of re infection from apparatus which is subsequent to initial acid treatment units also increases. Other apparatus problems include sediment build up on the walls and lime encrustation of conduits and valves. These can be combatted by acid treatment if promoted by alkali. Also, a schdule flow procedure desirably should be adaptable so as to accommodate the differences in feed stocks. For example, proteins denature and float or settle fairly rapidly in acid media and should be promptly removed substantially as formed rather than carried through to the final alkaline separation . This might require a structural by pass or alternate flow, if such a permanent pattern were not desired. Alternatively, colloidal material associated rvith oil and grease, e.g. refinery waste stream or laundry or car wash effluent, may require variations of procedure such as flow rate, residence time, pH, etc. directed to the particular contaminant and or its specific state, such as an emulsion.Also, particular flocculants may show greater adherance to the iron bed or chamber walls of the apparatus which therefor have to be flushed domm more often or with stronger reagents. Xn brief, even through successive sub units are assembled in a permanent flow stream or assembly line , at times it is highly desirable to be able to treat one or the other as an independently adjustable unit while the others are still left to function as parts of the whole. The basic process detailed in our EuropeanApplication No. 78300083.9 may be summarized as a stepwise treatment of flowable polar liquid such as water, which liquid contains dissolved and or suspended contaminants. At least a minimum 0.1 wt. of total solids contaminant should be capable of accepting a galvanic charge, which minimum quantity may be added if not initially present. All particulate matter present should have a size in the range of from 30 to 225Am diameter, free surface energy of from 100 x 107 to 500 x 107 joules cm2 and a density of from 1.05 to 2.0.That is, large solids are initially removed, for example by screeningr and the remainder are reduced to this particle size to which a galvanic charge is then imparted by pH control of the liquid medium which is held or flowed in an electrically insulated apparatus. Mle body of liquid is moved stepwise through successive reaction units and connecting flow channels which are constructed in accordance with specific dimensionless parameters so as to avoid undesired coalescence or precipitation of the moving, charged particles. The body of liquid is first exposed to a strong acidic oxidizing environment preferably of pH 2.0 to 2.5 produced by admixture therewith of sulfur dioxide, air and free electrons ions derive d from a flow through bed of pieces of iron. With continued intermixing of air or oxygen, the body of liquid is then made strongly alkaline by addition of lime or sodium hydroxide, preferably at pH 8 to 11. Desirably with electrically grounding the liquid, ferric hydroxide is flocculated and carries away other contaminants with it. The resulting sterile sludge and supernatent liquid, e.g.deconaminated water, can be further processed if desired, by dehydrating and fractionating the former, and filtration plus incorporation of oxygen into the latter. The present apparatus provides a more effective means of carrying out such basic process by coupling a corical reaction chamber with commercially available handling and control units to form a complete flow apparatus, which may even be automated. According to the present invention there is provided a mixing and reaction chamber particularly suitable for effecting selective, stepwise, treatment of a floable contaminated body of liquid therein, said chamber having multiple inlet means wath conduit coupling means for flow coupling respectively to acidic and alkaline reagent supply sources and for introduction of said body of liquid into the chamber, characterised in that the chamber has a conical body portion formed of do ir jardly tapering, internally smooth wlJalls terminating in a lower apical region having selective flow control and dual outlet means for separately uithdrasring from the contained body of liquid, a solid particle component and a supernatent liquid component separated therefrom, that the conical body portion has mixing means operative within its contained body of liquid and additionally has means for selective introduction of gaseous reagents including air into the body of liquid for reaction therewith, and that the conical body portion has power driven vibration means attached thereto and adapted for accentuating formation therein and accumulation of solid particles in said apical region following introduction of said acidic or alkaline reagents. Also in accordance with the invention there is provided an assembly for processing contaminated liquid so as to produce sterile solid material and substantially uncontaminated liquid therefrom, characterised in that the assembly comprises, in flow connected association, a mixing and reaction chamber of the invention disposed in functional connection with separate storage containers of acidic reagent and alkaline reagent capable of producing pHs of about 2 and about 10 respectively by reagent addition to said body of contaminated liquid an iron reaction chamber containing a flow through iron bed adapted to introduce ferrous ferric ions into said body of liquid when acidified, the iron reaction charter being disposed to receive liquid flow from said dual outlet means and being flow connected to deliver an outflow back to tile mixing and reaction chamber wlrllere alkaline reagent may be added thereto, and process control means including a stepping timer, pH sensors and remote operated pump and valve means for effecting stepwise treatment of successive acidification, iron reaction, alkylation and separation of contaminants in a solid state from said body of liquid. Tiros, the invention provides an improved, integrated, multi unit apparatus for better effecting the above described flow procedure of stepzise liquid decon tamination, which apparatus utilizes a hub like or central multi reaction vessel, advantageously of upstanding conical configuration and coupled by conduit, pump and valve means to satellite reaction and supply units which collectively enable effectuation of the successive steps of a complete treatment but now achieved with selective interconnections or flow channels. Mle multi or selective reaction cone is also selfcleaning by virtue of its alternate use for acidic and alkaline reactions and also by provision of a .vashdovm spray conduit which is connected to an acidic or biocide supply source. Trie conical reaction unit may be an article of commerce by itself and is provided around its upper cylindrical perimeter with coupling means for flow connection to separate acidic and alkaline supply chambers and for introduction of tbe liquid feed stock to the interior. Tne lower, generally apical region had dual outlets, for liquid and sediment, one connected to a dependent sludge separation sub unit which acts as a settling chamber. The conical walls preferably have no greater than about 270 slant from a generally vertical axis in order to prevent sludge from clinging to them, and externally the upstanding or outslanted walls carry power driven vibrators which, especially with a greater than 270 cone, may be required to accelerate flocculation and particle, e.g. sludge, separation from the body of liquid therein. Mle interior of the cone also has a motor driven mixing or stirrer unit disposed therein, as well as means for introducing external air and gaseous reactants such as sulfur dioxide into the body of liquid it also has a closure seal used when such gases are present. Mle satellite or associated units of the assembly comprise conduit and in line mixer connected reagent containers respectively containing gaseous sulfur dioxide, sulfuric acid, sodium hydroxide, lime, e.g. such as slurried lime and a final oxidative treating chemical such as chlorine or ozone. Selectively flow connected to the conical reactor by conduit, pump and valve means are a a primary aeration or surge tank with submerged macerator comminutor means, b a flow through iron containing tank for incorporation of ferric ferrous ions and free electrons into the acidic stream, c sludge separation and handling means to the extent required, d a terminal product liquid reservoir with associated filter and gaseous oxidation means for finishing treatment as required. A flow pattern can thus be established with treatment time and sequence particularly adapted to a particular feed stock, and the assembly then be set for continuous operation as controlled by a stepping switch and a unit timer which is responsive to the electronic monitoring elements of each unit. One way of carrying out the invention is described in detail below with reference to the drawings which illustrate only one specific embodiment, in which Fig. 1 is a minimal flow pattern and semi schematic apparatus assembly for acid alkali ir6n treatment used for chemically effected solid separation of contaminants dispersed in a polar liquid such as water Fig. 2 is an axial section taken through a conduit coupling Fig. 3 is an axial section taken through the outlet sludge valve of Fig. 4 Fig. 4 is a partial side elevational view and vertical section taken through the conical reaction chamber with dependent sludge separator Fig. 5 is a top view of the chamber of Fig. 4 with a portion of the closure removed to show the interior and Fig. 6 is a bottom plan view of the conical reaction chamber. An accumulation and preliminary treatment tank 10 Fig. 1 is supplied by conduit 12 with the waste water or other contaminant liquid to be treated. External air from blower 14 is introduced into the body of contaminated liquid through a plurality of outlet nozzles 16 supplied by conduit 15, which action also causes turbulence and mixing of the liquid and its particle content. Agitation is also promoted by action of a pair of submerged chopper grinder, e.g. macerator, pumps 20, 22 which ingest a steady stream of the treatment tank content, reduce solids to a maximum particle size as required and move the resultant mix through ball valves 26, 29, check valves 21,23 and ball valve 24 to a delivery line 25 which is coupled to the mixing and reaction chamber C. A return conduit 27 and ball valve 28 allow the pump output to continuously recirculate to the preliminary treatment tank 10 when so desired, or the valves may be set for fractional recirculation as required. The tank 10 is also provided with an odour adsorbent type gas vent 30 filled with activated carbon and a plurality of liquid level control or monitoring units 31, 32,33,34 located at upper and lower levels of tank 10 and electrically connected to a central control which balances in flow and outflow by remote controlled pump and valve action of the flow system. A liquid overflow line 18 and gas exhaust line 17 also connect the reaction chamber C to the surge tank 10, the latter through the blower 14 which is equipped with a vacuum release valve 19. A return line 49 connects the tank 10 to the terminal product tank R. A sulfuric acid supply tank 36, with liquid level sensor 37 is connected by outflow line 38 leading to alternate paths of control sequence, respectively, ball valve 40, pump 41, ball valve 42 and check valve 43, or ball valve 45, pump 46, ball valve 47 and check valve 48.Both sequences are flow connected to acid supply line 50 which is coupled to the reaction chamber C Fig. 1 . By an alternative flow of S02,,an acid supply can also enter through an in line or motionless mixer 112 from tanks 134, 136 as hereinafter explained. Paired or alternative control sequences involving pump and valve units are used throughout in order to have an alternative flow available in the event that the first used requires repair. Continuing the Fig. 1 flow apparatus, an aqueous sodium hydroxide supply container 101, with liquid level sensor 102 is connected by conduit 103 through alternate control sequences 104, 105, similar to the sulfuric acid control sequences, to supply conduit 100 which empties into the reaction chamber C. A line hopper 109 with eductor unit 111 and air blower 110 supplies lime to the reaction chamber C through control sequences 107, 108 and supply conduit 106.An external air blower 125 through conduit 126 introduces air into the body of liquid within the reaction chamber C. Trie lime hopper 109 may be supplied with preslurried lime which is a byproduct of the acetylene industry and contains about 40ego solids. this is usually pumpable without further addition of liquid. Tulle lime supply conduit 106 is selectively attachable to a coupling unit 95, and the sodium hydroxide supply conduit 100 is detachably coupled to a similar unit 97, both located adjacent the upper edge of the reaction chamber C. Flow comaected to the reaction chamber C by conduit 98 and in line mixer 112 is all acidic iron chamber 113 containing a flow through bed formed by small pieces of metallic iron such as rebar iron rods used in reinforcing concrete , the chamber also being supplied with external air by a blower 99.The botton inlet line 132 of the iron tank 113 is connected to gaseous sulfur dioxide containers 134, 136 by control sequences which include solenoid valves 135, 1 35a, 2lld pressure sensors 137, 137a. lime conduit 132 arises from a three xNray diverter valve 140 which, through conduits 141, 142 receives the supernatant or liquid outflow from the reaction chamber C after passage through outlet valve 128, turbidity sensor 143 and control sequences 144, 145. This conduit 142, 141 thus can convey initial feed stock or its liquid to the iron tank from the reaction chamber C after preliminary separation of sediment through valve 130 to the sludge separator S.By way of the iron tank 113 and mixer 112 the super nat ant flow may thus be re introduced to the reaction chary C and after subsequent treatment, including al1 ylatiOn and flocculation, the new supernatant liquid by wayof the same flow line 142, 141, may at the diverter valve 140 be directed through conduit 148 and filter 149 for introduction of gaseous oxidizer from storage container 150, then through in line mixer 152, conduit 153 and turbidity sensor 1 54 to three way valve 155.It may then be returned by conduit 49 to tXle initial surge tank 10, if required, or run into the product reservoir R by conduit 156. The product reserv oir R also has all air blower 158 for bottom level aeration of the contained liquid by way of dependent no les 1 60. Returning to the outflow from the reaction chamber C, which will be detailed subsequently, sludge from the separator unit S passes through a motorized ball valve 131 and conduit 133 to a sludge sensor 129 and through alternate control sequences 138, 139 to a three way diverter valve 146 connecting to return conduit 147 leading to the surge tank 10 and by alternate conduit 157 is conveyed to a settling cone 158 having liquid level sensors 159, 160.From the cone apex, flowable sludge passes through a motorized ball valve 162 and a sludge sensor 163 to alternate control sequences 164 1 65 and then to a three way diverter valve 166 connecting to return conduit 167 leading to the surge tank 10 and by alternate conduit 168 to an endless belt type, sludge press 170 and a variable angle drying table 172, which latter may be essentially a flat cement slab with elevating jacks, not shove, located at one end for optional use. As detailed in Fig. 4, the reaction chamber C is located in an upright manner by four support legs 118 119, 120, 121. The vessel is formed by a metallic shell 173 having a conical body segment 174 and an upper, generally cylindrical segment 175 provided with a top lip or out turned flange 176 to which a flat top or closure 177 may be secured as by clamps or bolts 178.Such cover is used to form a gas chamber 179 overlying a body of liquid held within the cone and thereabove.Gas such as oxygen or sulfur dioxode, after injection escaping unreacted from the contained liquid, may be moved from this confined space 179 through control valve 35 and conduit 17 for submerged entry into the surge tank 10 by means of blower 14. The lower apical region 127 of the chamber C is connected through a ball type drainage valve 130 Fig. 3 to a dependent sludge receptacle or container S. The latter is fastened to the support legs by corresponding bracket plates 124. Within the metallic shell 173 is an acid and alkali resistant liner 180 which may be formed of reinforced fiberglass and is adhered to the metal body wall. The internal, liquid contacting surface of the liner should have a smooth, low friction face so as to minimize sediment or precipitate clinging thereto instead of sliding down the sloping face to the bottom outlet and into the sludge receiptacle S through a normally open aperture 182 of the connecting ball valve 130. Such liner can also be formed of epoxy resin, sprayed onto the metal or by 30 mil polyvinylchloride molded as a rigid form. The motor driven mixer 122, 123 and the air blower 125 may each be separately suspended into the liquid volume of the chamber C when the top of the vessel is left uncovered. Alternately the motor 123 may be mounted on the closure 177 with the drive shaft 122 extending therethrough similarly the blower 125 mazt be mounted atop the closure 177 with the air delivery conduit 126 extending therethrough into the body of contained liquid. Secured about the inner perimeter of the cylindrical segment 175 of the conical chamber C, adjacent the upper edge or mouth thereof, is an encircling conduit ring 185 having a plurality of spray outlet apertures or nozzles 186 directed to flush or wash down the inner wall surface of the reactor by the fanspread pattern of liquid emitted therefrom. The ring 185 is flow connected to the sulfuric acid supply conduit 50, or to a biocide supply, through the valve couS g 187. The cylindrical segment 175 of the chamberC also has a coupling attachment 97 for the sodium hydroxide supply conduit 100 plus the coupling attachment 98 for the overflow line 18 and 96 for line 117. Located on opposite sides of the conical body portion 174 of the chamber C, spotted along a helical path, are a pair of compressed air powered vibrators V1 and V2, which are inwardly fastened to a respective anchorage plate 188, 189 and project radially outwardly through the metallic body 173 that is, each strut or anchorage plate sandwiches a strip of the liner 1 8g between it and the reinforcing shell 173. Simultaneous operation of the vibrators, at different frequencies, is found to eliminate potential dead spots of sediment particle attachment along the down sloped surface wall.Also, during acid and alkaline precipitation or flocculation, the vibrator action accelerates the reaction by promoting intermixing. As the inclination of the conic walls increases beyond about 270 from the vertical axis, the need for such vibrators is correspono ingly increased in order to overcome the flo resista . e offered by the walls, which resistance is of course increased by roughness of the walls. Such initial roughness of the metal cone is reduced, as noted, by coating its inner surface with synthetic resin. Alternately the so called Zorb tanks may be used, made by Polycal Plastics Corp., of high density polyethylene. A typical quick coupling construction for attaching flexible conduits to the reaction chamber C is shown in Fig. 2. The conduit end E has a adiall opposing pair of grab handles 89, 91 and is formed with a pair of L shaped bayonet slots which thrust engage and upon partial rotation seat a corresponding pair oF coupling pins 90, 92 carried by the coupling mouth M w rhich is fixed on the chamber C or the closure 177. operation of the apparatus is as follows Raw sewage was run into the surge tank 10 as obtained from Los Coyotes Water Reclamation Center. It had a pH of 6.98, turbidity 175 NTU, iron content 4.0 mug 1, TDS 1125 mug 1, coliform count 79 million, BOD 112 mg i, suspended solids 167 mug 1. Without aeration, it was moved to the reaction chamber C through conduit 25 by action of a Vaughn chopper grinder pump 20 or 22. This pump had a capacity of 3 gal min and it took about 25 min. to transfer 75 gal. of this feed stock to the 80 gal. reaction chamber C. During this period, the liquid outlet valve 128, as well as the sludge valves 130,131 remained closed and the chopper pwnp s 20,22 was shut off by the liquid level control 114. However, the valves 128 and 140 could have remained open and the incoming feed been allowed to circulate through the iron tank 113 and mixer 112 and returned to the chamber C through conduit 117, either with or without addition of sulfur dioxide or sulfuric acid i.e. to the extent that it was acidic, the flow would accumulate ions and electrons from the iron tank. The acidification cycle then commences with activation of the pump P3 or P4 which moves the feed stock from the bottom of the chamber C through outlet valve 128 and conduits 142, 141, 132 into the iron tank 113, then through motionless mixer 112 and return conduit 117, via coupling attachment 96 to the chamber C where it continues to be agitated by the slow moving mixer 122. With activation of the pump P3 or P4, a central pH control meter which is connected to the pH sensor 116 of the chamber C activates the solenoid valve 135 or 135a which injects sulfur dioxide gas from pressure container 134 or 136 through the pressure sensor 137 or 137a. Alternate to acidifying with sulfur dioxide, sulfuric acid from container 36 can be added to the chamber C by action of the pump 41 or 46, and the body of liquid from C circulated through the iron tank 113 as Just described. Some contaminants are found to be more responsive to treatment with one reagent than the other trial runs may initially be made. Typically about 15 minutes is allowed for acidic reaction with the feed stock itself, plus an equal time for reaction of the mixture with the iron tank components including oxygen or air. Accordingly, if the feed stock is circulated through the iron tank as soon as sulfuric acid or sulfur dioxide commences to be added to it, such circulation may continue for about half an hour. use with a 75 gal. capacity chamber C and recirculation pump operation of 14 gal min.the liquid flow completes an iron and acidic injection passage every 5 minutes. The pumps P3, P4 stop at the end of the acidic cycle and the central stepping switch controller such as made by Amerace Corp., Control Products Division, Agastat TM, or the timing control made by Eagle SignalDivision of Gulf Western Mfg Co., starts the alkylation cycle which again is governed by the pH meter in response to its variously distributed pH probes. Such units are made, for example, by Great Lakes Instruments, Inc. .Lime slurry from hopper 109 is added on a pulsed basis to the chamber C through conduit 106 by action of a low volume progressing cavity pump P9 or P10 which is activated for 10 seconds of every minute. When the pH is raised to about 10, the pump is deactivated and mixing by the slow mixer 122, 123 is continued for a total of about 20 minutes. In some instances, sodium hydroxide is used in conjunction with the lime. After mixing is stopped, valve 130 is opened, or may have remained open during alkylation, and settling is allowed for 3 to 4 hours, with the use of the vibrators as may be required for less steep walled reactor cones. The sludge separator S should hold the total solid content of the chamber C. For an 80 gal. chamber, a sludge container S of about 4 gal. is adequate. Thus, a total batch time is 5 hours, based on filling 25 min. acidification iron contact 30 min. neutralization 20 min. settling 4 hrs. liquid and sludge discharge 15 min. In a 75 gal. assembly, 4 batches a day are possible 300 gallons day capacity. After flocculation of the alkylation cycle, the supernatent liquid from the above Ilos Coyotes raw sen age had coliforn N N reduced to 70 100 ml. Another ra sewage sample which in addition was given oxidation treatment following flocculation had initial 4,900,ODO coliforn Man 100 ml reduced to less than 2.2 MPN 100 ml the processed sludge was also less than 2.2 MPI4 100 ml. It was also demonstrated that initial aeration oxidation in the surge tank 10 is of great value in reducing biochemical oxygen demand BOD . Raxv sewage with initial BOD 158.3 mg 1 was reduced to 128.0 mg with 20 hours aeration, and to 86.7 mg 1 with 40 hr. aeration. With 20 hr. aeration plus flocculation plus 20 hr. post aeration it was reduced to 38.7 mug 1. These runs illustrate the cumulative effect of the successive steps. Tiros, the above result 70 100 ml which was obtained without initial aeration in tank 10 for purposes of illustration, would have been still further reduced by the 5 hour cycle time spent in the surge tank 10 and would be further reduced by post cycle oxidation, if required.
