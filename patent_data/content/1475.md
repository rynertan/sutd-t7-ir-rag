# Xerographic copier system including a hot roll fuser.

## Abstract
The rolls 31, 32 of a hot roll fuser are normally closed at a predetermined time prior to the arrival of a copy sheet at the roll nip. If, however, the temperature of the backup roll 32 exceeds a predetermined value, the rolls are closed at a shorter time before the copy sheet arrival. A sensor 50 is coupled to threshold circuit 53 which applies enabling inputs to AND gates 64, 66 . These gates receive timing signals from a counter and decoder system 71, 73, 74, 75 and, in accordance with the output from the threshold circuit 53 apply either an early or a late pulse to a fuser roll closure latch 78 . Instead of directly measuring the backup roll temperature, the timing of opening and closing of the fuser rolls may be monitored to predict the temperature of the backup roll.
