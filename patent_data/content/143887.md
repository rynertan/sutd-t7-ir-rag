# Distributed impatt structure.

## Abstract
In a distributed IMPATT structure, power is coupled out through a side contact 14. That is, in previously proposed distributed IMPATT structures the gain medium 16 the active region of the IMPATT operates as a transmission line. The prior art has attempted to couple output power from the gain medium 16 through an end contact, i.e. through a contact which is perpendicular to the primary direction of energy propagation and also to the direction of maximum elongation of the active medium. In the present invention, a sidewall contact 14 extends in a direction which is parallel to the principal direction of progagation of the energy in the active medium as does a ground contact 18. Thus, the sidewall contact plus the active region together can be considered as a single transmission line. In one embodiment, this extended transmission line is also connected to a second distributed semiconductor element which functions as a varactor. By changing the bias voltage on this varactor, the distributed capacitance of the transmission line is changed, and this change in transmission line loading causes a change in the propagation characteristic of the transmission line. If the transmission line has reflective terminations, the resonant frequency of the section between these terminations changes accordingly.

## Description
Background and Summary of the Invention The present invention relates to solid state microwave devices including oscillators, amplifiers, phase shifters, and attenuators. In particular, the present invention relates to Avalanche Transit Time Devices. Avalanche Transit Time Devices. provide a negative resistance which can in principle be used to operate at extremely high microwave frequencies, since the transit time which limits the frequency response is a transit time in a vertical direction, and can be therefore controlled by layer thickness. In addition, these devices are in principle capable of high power densities at extreme microwave and millimeter frequencies. However, the theoretical potential of such structures has in the past proved difficult to take advantage of, largely due to problems of external impedance matching, which have made it difficult to effectively couple power out of these devices, which are typically fabricated physically small to increase impedance levels.In particular, when they are configured as discrete devices, as is common, the individual IMPATTs or other AvalancheTransit Time Diode type are physically tiny, area being inverselv proportional to frequency and their assembly in a power combining package will therefore typically contain significant mismatches due to assembly error, which lowers the maximum number of diodes which can be combined. It has therefore been difficult to combine enough IMPATTs to get usefully large amounts of power out at higher microwave and millimeter wave frequencies, e.g. 94 GHz. A further important consideration in the art ofAvalanche Transit Time Devices is that such devices are tvpically quite noisy. Thus, when such a device is to be used, e.g. as a local oscillator, the filtering which is required for reduction of device noise will impose significant additional loses on the already minimal output power of the device. Thus, output power for Avalanche Transit Time Devices is generally at a premium. It is an object of the present invention to provide an Avalanche Transit Time Device such that the outputs of multiple devices can easily be combined for high power. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a Avalanche Transit Time Device having an easy and practical means for coupling the output power out. The possibility of distributed semiconductor diode structures with negative resistance has been discussed in the prior art. The Hines paper, High frequencv IMPATT resistance circuit principles for Esaki diode applications , Bell System Technical Journal Volume 39, page 477 1950 , which is hereby incorporated by reference , is primarily directed to tunnel diodes and does not mention IMPATTs , but does mention the possibility of a distributed semiconductor structure having gain. The Davydova et al paper, Linear Theory of an IMPATT Diode Distributed Microwave Amplifier, in Telecommunications and Radio Enqineering, Part 2, Volume 27, page 112 1972 , which is hereby incorporated by references, does discuss the possiblity of a distributed IMPATT.The Midford et al article, A two port IMPATT Diode Travelling Wave Amplifier, which appeared at pages 1724 and 1725 of the Proceedings of the IEEE in lq68, provides a cursory description of an allegedly functional distributed IMPATT device built in m i1icon. However, at the time of this article it had not yet been realized that the optimal conductivity for the contact p and n layer in the IMPATT is not infinite. The Hambleton et al article Design Considerations for Resonant Travelling Wave IMPATT Oscillator, International Journal of Electrics, Volume 35, pages 225 244 1973 provided a greatly improved theoretical analysis of distributed IMPATT structure.Finally, the two Franz and Beyer articles, The Travelling Wave IMPATT mode, IEEE Transactions in Microwave Theorv and Techniques, Volume MTT 26, page 861 1978 , and The Travelling Wave IMPATT mode Part Il The Effective WaveImpedance and Equivalent Transmition, IEEE Transactions inMicrowave Theory and Techniques, Volume MTT 28, pages 215 218 1980 , taught what is now the standard theoretical analysis of distributed IMPATT operation. In particular,Figure 10 of the second Franz and Beyer article sets forth the standard modeling for a distributed IMPATT structure as a transmission line with gain. This model is followed in the discussion of the present invention. All of these references are hereby incorporated by reference. In a distributed IMPATT structure, power is coupled out through a side contact. That is , in previously proposed distributed IMPATT structures the gain medium the active region of the IMPATT operates as a transmission line. The prior art has attempted to couple output power from the gain medium through an end contact, ie through a contact which intercepts the primary direction of energy propagation and also to the direction of maximum elongation of the active medium. In the present invention, a side contact extends along the whole active region in a direction which is parallel to the principal direction of propagation of the energy in the active medium. Thus, the sidewall contact plus the active region together can be considered as a single transmission line. The present invention can be configured both as oscillators and as amplifiers. When configured as an oscillator, multiple short active regions can be sequentially coupled to a sinqle long microstrip, which serves as the sidewall contact for each of the active regions. This very simple power combining scheme provides extremely high power at millimeter wave frequencies. According to the present invention there is provided a microwave device comprising a semiconductor diode active region interposed between frontside and backside contacts, said semiconductor active region defining a negative resistance diode between said frontside and backside contacts said semiconductor active region and said frontside and backside contacts being elongated in a first direction said frontside contact being extended beyond said active region in a direction normal to said first direction, to form a transmission line having a principal direction of propagation substantially parallel to said first direction. In a further aspect, the present invention relates to a voltage controlled oscillator VCO for operation at millimeter wave frequencies above 30 GHz . Numerous methods have been used in the microwave art to configure voltage controlled oscillators VCO . VCOs are s.sential to many microwave a plications, such as chirped radar and electronic counter measures, in addition to the general utility of VCOs as circuit elements. However, an important limitation of many prior art microwave VCOs is frequency range and frequency agility. That is, conventional microwave means such as YIG tuned oscillators, have important frequency limitations. Thus it is an object of the present invention to provide a solid state voltage controlled oscillator which can operate at 94 GHz. A further difficulty with the prior art voltage controlled oscillator circuits is their parasitic reactance. That is , where an active element must be connected to a resonating circuit containing a variablereactance element, the connections themselves become sources of trouble at millimeter wave frequencies. That is, it is very difficult to design any connection scheme which will not introduce major and uncertain amounts of reactance, and which will not provide substantial resistive and radiation losses. Thus it is an object of the present invention to provide a voltage controlled oscillator wherein the active element is completely integrated with a variable reactance element. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a voltage controlled oscillator wherein the active element is completely integrated with the variable reactance element, and which is capable of operation at frequencies well in excess of 30 GHz. A further important desideratum in microwave VCOs is frequency agility. That is, the techniques which are required for high frequency voltage controlled oscillation are not always compatible with extreme frequency agility.However, frequency agility is itself necessary for many electronic counter measure applications, and is highly desirable for many chirped radar applications. Thus it is an object of the present invention to provide a voltage controlled oscillator which can oscillate and provide frequency agility in excess of 1 GHz per micro second at frequencies in excess of 30 GHz. An integrated low loss millimeter wave phase shifter is also useful for many applications, particularly phased array radar. Thus it is an object of the present invention to provide an integrated low loss millimeter wave phase shifter.

Description of the Preferred Embodiments The structure and operation of a distributed 2port oscillator, which is itself novel, will first be described in detail, and then the distributed VCO of the present invention will be described. The present invention is not by any means limited to distributed IMPATT diodes, but is in general applicable to a distributed realization of any 2 terminal device with gain. That is, applicable device types which may be realized in a distributed mode include not only IMPATTs and other Avalanche Transit Time Devices such as BARITTs, TUNNETTs, MITTATs, DOVATTs, heterojunction IMPATTs, etc. , but also transferred electron devices Gunn diodes, oscillators, etc. and tunnel diodes. However, the presently preferred embodiment uses an IMPATT diode, and this embodiment will be discussed primarily. It should be noted that IMPATT diodes have a particular advantage of good high frequency characterisics and are preferable to many of the other 2 terminal device types for this reason. However, the scope of the present invention is not limited except as specified in the Claims. A distributed IMPATT is basically a long strip of IMPATT diode. The depletion layer becomes a parallel plate wave guide which supports a travelling wave. Due to the distributed nature of the device, the power frequency limitations associated with lumped diodes do not apply. The devices can therefore be made much larger in area than the conventional IMPATTs giving high power handling capabilitv. A typical structure is shown in Figure 1. The IMPATT structure is of single drift type with the drift region 8 made of n type GaAs. The dePletion region terminals p and n layers 6 and 4 respectively form the boundary for the waveguide. The device is shunt resonated at the depletion layer boundries, taking full advantage of the high negative conductance of the active layer. This is illustrated in more detail in Figure 15. In 15a, the parallel connected R and Cd represent a lumpedIMPATT. R is usually 500 or larger. In order to oscillate this device a load with positive real part and inductive imaqinary part is needed. This is supplied by waveguide cavities.However, looking from the circuitside, this IMPATT is a series combination of negative resistance R and Cd Figure 2b where R is about 5 . Obviously, Rs which includes all the losses in the circuit and the diode as well as the load resistance, must be smaller than R . In order to increase R the diode area is made very small and this in turn limits the power output. In a distributed device, the waveguide is the depletion layer of the IMPATT and therefore it is shunt resonated as shown in 2c. Cd and L components will be made to have equal magnitudes and Rs will now be limited by negative resistanceR which is much larger than R1 Therefore, devices do not have to be small and no external resonant circuit is needed. The key advantages of a travelling wave IMPATT are at least two 1 High sower capability due to increased device area for a given frequency. 23 Built in resonator capability. No external circuitry is, therefore, needed. In the millimeter wave range this is an important consideration, since the resonant circuits become more difficult to design and produce than the IMPATT device itself. Distributed IMPATTs can best be produced in a monolithic form for ease in manufacturing and integration. In the millimeter wave range, the length and the width of the device are typically 1 5 mm and 10 100 microns respectively. This represents no particular problem in production. A tapered impedance transformer can be produced on semi insulating SI GaAs to match the load and the device impedances. It is possible to use microstrip lines on 4 mil thick SI GaAs substrate up to at least 100 GHz, and even higher on thinner substrates. Figure 10 shows a sectional view of a monolithic distributed device according to the present invention. A substrate 10 is provided, such as semi insulating GaAs.Semi insulating GaAs is preferred because it provides for convenient integration of a distributed device of the present invention with other monolithic microwave integrated circuit components such as FETs, varactors, etc. Ho wever, other substrates may be preferred for heat sinking. That is, alternative embodiments of the present invention could also be formed as miniature hybrid structures on diamond, copper,BeO, silver, or thick gold plated substrate. In these cases the fabrication process is different, preferably using an AlGaAs etch stop to permit patterning of the contact layers .The importance of heat sinking depends partly on the operation mode that is, a pulse mode operation at a low duty cvcle imposes less stringent requirements on heat sinking than high duty cycle or cw applications, Atop the semi insulating e.g. chrome doped GaAs substrate 10 are formed an n layer 20 and an active device region 16. In the presently preferred embodiment, these layers are deposited by molecular beam epitaxy. However, other methods well known to those skilled in the art may be used to form the structure. The semiconductor layers in the active region 16 of the device of the present invention are not themselves novel, and a wide variety of prior art semiconductor structures may be used.The presently preferred embodiment uses a conventional double drift IMPATT structure, wherein a backside contact layer 20 which is heavily doped is overlaid by an n type drift region 22, a p type drift reqion 24, and a p contact region 26. In the presently preferred embodiment, for operation in the neighborhood of 50 GHz, the drift regions 22 and 24 are each about 300 nano meters thick. This thickness will be preferably scaled according to frequency, as as well known to those still in the art. For example, for operation at 94GHz, the layers 22 and 24 would each be approximately 200 nanometers thick, and of higher doping density. In the presently preferred embodiment, the doping density of the layers 22 and 24 is each approximately 2E17 per cc, but, as is well known to those skilled in the art, different doping levels can be chosen.The doping and thickness of these layers are preferably chosen so that the depletion layer surrounding the junction between layers 22 and 24 spreads just to the edge of the contact layers 20 and 26 at the breakdown voltage which is lower than the operating voltage . In the presently preferred embodiment the p layer 26 is reasonably thin, e.g. 200 nm, but this thickness could be varied. It is essential that the p contact layer 26 be thinner than the skin depth at frequencies of interest, but this is not a difficult constraint, since, for GaAs, the skin depth at 94 GHz is several microns. The n contact layer 20 is preferably thick, but this is done for convenience in the device fabrication steps used. As seen in Figure 10, a double mesa structure is preferably used. That is, after all layers through layer 26 are deposited, the first mesa etch step is performed to define a large mesa. The large mesa corresponds to the width shown for contact layer 20 in Figure 10. A second mesa etch is then performed to remove the active region 16 i.e. layers 22, 24, and 26 from the portion of n contact layer. 20 where the ground contact metallization 18 is typically deposited. Subsequently, a silicon nitride layer 12 is deposited and patterned, and a side contact 14 and ground contact 18 are patterned to provide front and back contacts to the four layer structure shown in Figures 11 and 12. The back side metallization 22 is provided merely as an Rf ground plane, and to assist heat sinking and mounting. A plan view of the distributed device according to the present invention is shown in Figure 2. The view shown inFigure 10 corresponds to a sectional view along section a a in Figure 2. A side coupler 14 operates as a transmission line, propagating energy in the direction shown by the arrow.Thus, the side coupler of 14 can itself be converted to a microstrip line, and provide coupling to other circuit elements. One example of a monolithic microwave circuit incorporating the distributed diode of the present invention is shown in Figure 3. As shown in Figure 2, the diode active region 16 is highly elongated. For example, in the presently preferred embodiment this diode is 10 microns wide, but may be millimeters in length. When the diode is being operated as an oscillator, the fundamental resonant frequency of a diode is determined by its length, as shown in Figure 6. As seen in Figure 4, the relation between single pass gain and the endpoint reflection coefficent determines whether a simple diode will act as an oscillator or an amplifier. If the single pass voltage reflection coefficent squared is equal to the single pass gain, the device will settle into a standing wave condition and will function as an oscillator. That is, if the single pass gain initially exceeds the reflection coefficent squared, the signal levels within the device rise until saturation begins to limit the gain, so that the equality condition is satisfied. On the other hand, if the reflection coefficent squared exceeds the single pass gain, then the device will function as a multi pass amplifier. If the reflection coefficent greatly exceeds the single pass gain, then the amplification will effectively be sinqle pass amplification. These various operating modes imply different degrees of frequency selectivity. As shown in Figure 5, an amplifier which is operating as single pass will not be frequency selective, as shown by the solid curve. However, multi pass amplification introduces increasing amounts of ripple, and the oscillator condition provides resonance. Figure 6 shows some sample implementations of the present invention, indicating the dependence of the fundamental mode of oscillating frequency on the device length. As noted, it is preferable to optimize the thickness of the drift regions the lightly doped region between the heavily doped contact layers in an IMPATT device for the operating frequency desired. It is possible to get spatial harmonics in a cavity mode resonantor, but this tends not to be a major problem in distributed IMPATTS according to the present invention, because of the frequency selectivity due to the thickness of the drift regions. Of course, in an extremely long device with appropriately shallow drift regions, the harmonics could be close enough together to have multiple stable oscillation f r e uenc i e 5. If it were des i red to configure a millimeter wave comb filter, it could be done in this fashion according to the present invention. In addition, the resonant frequency is somewhat sensitive to the thickness and doping of the contact layers 20 and 26. These contact layers load the transmission line, and therefore can lower the phase velocity of propagation in the transmission line, which lowers the resonant frequency. Depending on the DIMPATT characteristic impedance, the side coupling microstrip characteristic impedance may need to be small. In this case, it is desirable to transition from standard 50 ohm transmission line at the input 102 to low impedance Z3 in several lambda 4 transformers 106. lambda corresponds to the wavelength in the microstrip at the center frequency of frequency band . Multi section transformers give broader band impedance matching. Similar lambda 4 transformer sections increase the characteristic impedance level at the output terminal.Figure 16 shows this configuration preferably the impedances increase geometrically. For specific applications it may be desirable to change DIMPATT width in other words, use wider devices 10 closer to the output end, to ensure that each device 108 or 110 experiences similar power densities. In this case it may be desirable to couple the devices 108 closer to the input port at a different impedance level than those 110 closer to the output, as shown in Figure 17. Alternatively, similar size diodes can be used, but with the coupling changed towards the output. This can be achieved, as shown in Figure 18, by again chanqing the characteristic impedance of the microstrip. Near the input port, better impedance match is supplied, so that the device 108 is strongly coupled to microstrip portion 112. The second device 108 is less strongly coupled to microstrip portion 114, and the last device is weakly coupled to microstrip portion 116. In this fashion, as the wave moves towards the output port 104, less of it propagates through the active medium of each successive DIMPATT 108. Although a lesser portion is going through the last device 108, the absolute value of power density in each device 108 can be same since the wave propagating in the microstrip is gaining in power. The two approaches are somewhat similar. The difference is that the de coupling is achieved in one by changing line impedance, and in the other, by changing device impedance. Alternatively, where it is desired to ensure oscillatory behavior, this can again be accomplished bv patterning of the side coupler 14 to assure an impedance discontinuity at the end of the active region 16. Another way of ensuring single pass amplification activity is to use a magnetic field with a ferrite substrate, to ensure directionality. That is, as is well known in the art, if the substrate 10 is made of a ferrimagnetic material, and a dc bias magnetic field is applied normal to the plane of the substrate, wave propogation will preferentially occur in one. direction, so that the device of the present invention will simply act as a single pass 2 port amplifier. To combine multiple oscillators or amplifiers according to the present invention, they can simply be connected in series along a transmission line. That is, the sidewall coupler 14 can be extended to provide a microstrip transmission line, with a plurality of active regions 16 spaced along it. As the active region 16 is made wider, the power handling capacity naturally increases. However, if the active region 16 is made too wide, the characteristic impedance of the device becomes small and effective impedance matching at input output ports becomes more difficult. A practical upper limit for device length is about one tenth of one wavelength of the electromagnetic wave propagating in the device. For a given area device, length width ratio should be kept as large as possible to reduce thermal impedance withoutexceeding the specific limits imposed on the device length. Devices operating as oscillators need to be of specific lengths whereas those operating as amplifiers, phase shifters or attenuators can be of varyinq length depending on application needs. The gain of an amplifier, the phase shift of a phase shifter, or the attenuation of an attenuator is a strong function of device length. Also, to suppress unwanted oscillations, the device lenqth should be chosen such that the IMPATT action cannot supply adequate gain at the frequency which would be suitable for oscillators dictated by device length. Thus, the key teaching of the present invention is that power is coupled out of a distributed negative resistance diode using a side contact which is coupled to the diode along substantially all of the length of the diode active region. This teaching, which has fundamental novelty, can be modified and varied to provide a wide range of embodiments.While the most preferred embodiments couple the distributedIMPATT to a microstrip line having a propagation direction parallel to the long direction of the diode, as shown inFigure 3, embodiments such as Figures 19 and 20 couple theIMPATT to a wide microstripe line extending normal to the long dimension of the diode. The side contact of the distributed diode of the present invention can be d.c. coupled as a microstrip transmission line, but it is alternatively possible to capacitatively couple the contact 206 which extends along diode 208 through a dielectric 210 to a microstrip transmission line 204, as shown in Figure 21. Under strong coupling conditions, the Q of the distributed IMPATT is lowered, and the distributed IMPATT device can therefore be injection locked over a wide frequency range. Additional devices can be coupled with the same microstripe line. In order to achieve nonreciprocity, in addition to the methods noted above, isolators may be inserted between the distributed IMPATT devices. Thus the present invention provides a fundamental innovation in the art of microwave devices, having as advantages all of the above enumerated objects of the invention. While the present invention has been described with reference to one particular embodiment, it teaches a general concept of very broad applicability. The present invention is therefore not limited except as specified in the accompanying Claims, which are to be construed broadly. This distributed oscillator structure is adapted to form a distributed VCO, simply by including a variable capacitance element in the transmission line. That is, as seen in Figure 22, the sidewall contact 301 of the distributed IMPATT 303 or other distributed oscillator is also attached as one terminal of a preferably distributed variable capacitance. This variable capacitance 302 has a back bias contact 304, and, by varying the bias on the distributed capacitor of 302, the loading on the transmission line can be changed. This means that the phase velocity on a transmission line is changed, and this in turn means that the oscillation frequency of a fixed length cavity will also change. However, the cavity will still be resonanting in its fundamental mode, and will still therefore provide a highly stable high oscillator.Moreover, once the distributed capacitance has been changed, the oscillator will acquire a new resonant frequency in omly a few cavity transit times.This means that such an oscillator has extreme frequency agility and stability. In the presently preferred embodiment, this is configured with a distributed IMPATT structure as described above. An air bridge 306 connects the sidewall contact of a distributed IMPATT structure to a distributed varactor structure 302. Alternatively bridge 306 may be supported by a solid dielectric 307 such as polyimide. The distributed varactor structure 302 preferably has a specific capacitance of approximately one tenth of the specific capacitance of the distributed IMPATT oscillator. In the presently preferred embodiment, the distributedIMPATT structure 303 is a double drift IMPATT having an active region which is a total of 0.6 microns thick at a doping of about 2E1017 per cubic centimeter, as described above. The air bridge 306 is made of Au which is approximately 3 microns thick. The distributed capacitor 302 is laterally separated from the active distributed IMPATT structure by approximately 15 microns. The distributed capacitance 302 itself preferably comprises a backside contact layer 304 of GaAs, deposited directly on a substrate 309, which is about 2 mils thick and dosed to at least 5El8 per cubic centimeter. Atop this provided at least one additional layer of GaAs, which is more lightly doped with the opposite conductivity type. A heavily doped top contact region permits ohmic contact to the air bridge 306. Thus, it is preferable that the distributed varactor structure 302 be formed simply using the same semiconductor layer structure as is used to form the active region of the distributed IMPATT. This provides ease in fabrication. The bias voltage applied at the varactor bias contact 310 is naturally much less e.g. about 5v than that used to bias the IMPATT e.g. about 15v . Alternatively, the variable capacitance could be formed simply by the depletion region under a Schottky Barrier contact, or by other means well known to those skilled in the art. It is not necessary that the distributed varactor elements have the same length as the distributed IMPATT elements, although this is preferable. A sample application example of the varactor controlledDIMPATT oscillator of the present invention is a phase locked oscillator, which in essence is an amplifier with low noise figure, as shown in Figure 25. In this application, the frequency and the amplitude of the output power from the DIMPATT 402 is sampled through weak coupling 404. In one branch, the output frequency and the input signal are compared at a discriminator 406 where output voltage is proportional to the frequency difference delta f 2 fl. This video signal 408 is amplified and used to control the d.c. bias 410 of the varactor diode 412 until theDIMPATT frequency is locked onto f. A second sampling of the output power can be fed to a detector 414 whose output voltage is proportional to rf voltage. This voltage is amplified and used to control d.c. bias current 416 which controls output via comparator 418 and power supply 420 power of DIMPATT 402. Output power can be thus levelled to a desired value. As will be obvious to those skilled in the art, the present invention provides a fundamental new innovation in monolithic microwave integrated circuits, and in solid state microwave and millimeter wave components generally. An extremely broad scope of the equivalents of the present invention is therefore asserted, and the scope of the present invention is expressly not limited except as set forth in the accompanying Claims.
