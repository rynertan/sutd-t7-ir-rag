## Description
The present invention relates to a method of and an apparatus for forming a film by utilizing low temper ature plasma, and more particularly to a film formation apparatus which utilizes low temperature plasma and is suited to form an inter layer insulating film necessary for integrated circuits such as an LSI namely, a large scale integration circuit to have a multi layer structure. In a film formation apparatus which utilizes low temperature plasma to grow an insulating film on a flat substrate such as an LSI substrate, the substrate is kept at a relatively low temperature to improve the quality of the grown film, and the acceleration of ions is made as little as possible to prevent the degradation of the film due to ion bombardment. However, when an LSI includes a multi layered wiring structure, a wiring pattern is formed, as a protrusion, on an underlying layer and thus a groove is formed between adjacent wiring conductors. It is desirable that the groove is filled with an inter layer insulating film grown on the wiring conductors, and moreover the inter layer insulating film has a flat surface. In a conventional film formation apparatus utilizing low temperature plasma, however, an inter layer insulating film having an uneven surface is formed, and moreover a coarse film may be formed on the above groove. The construction and operation of the conven tional film formation apparatus will be explained below, by reference to the drawings. Fig. 6 shows a conventional ECR type electron cyclotron resonance type film formation apparatus which utilizes low temperature plasma generated in electron cyclotron resonance conditions, as disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,401,054 issued on August 30, 1983. Referring to Fig. 6, microwaves 2 are introduced into a plasma forma tion chamber 3 which is provided in a central portion of the film formation apparatus, through a waveguide 1. When the frequency of the microwaves 2 agrees with the frequency of the cyclotron motion of electron due to the magnetic field generated by a magnetic coil 4, electron cyclotron resonance occurs, and plasma 6 is generated in the plasma formation chamber 3 on the basis of the collision of electrons with a gas 5 for example, O₂ introduced into the chamber 3. The plasma 6 thus generated is introduced into a specimen chamber 7 by the intensity gradient of the magnetic field generated by the magnetic coil 4, and activates a film material gas 8 for example, SiH₄ introduced into the specimen chamber 7, to grow an insulating film for example, an SiO₂ film on the surface of a specimen 10, such as a silicon substrate, which is placed on a specimen table 9. In this case, the kinetic energy of ions contained in the plasma 6 which has been extracted into the specimen chamber 7, is made low so as not to damage the surface of the grown film by ion bombardment. Fig. 7 shows another conventional ECR type film formation apparatus which utilizes low temperature plasma generated in electron cyclotron resonance conditions. This type of apparatus is disclosed in Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 59 3018 published January 9, 1984. This apparatus is different from the apparatus for Fig. 6 in that a variable voltage dc power source 13 and an RF power source 11 are selectively connected to the specimen table 9 in such a manner that the RF power 11 is applied through a capacitor 12 to the specimen table 13 for preventing the specimen table from being electrically charged and the dc power 13 is applied, simultaneously or instead of the RF power, to the specimen table for controlling the energy of ions incident upon the specimen 10. When an insulating film is grown on the specimen 10 by these film formation apparatuses, the insulating film will have such a cross section as shown in Fig. 8. That is, owing to the presence of wiring conductors 10b on a surface of a substrate 10a, a groove 14a having the depth It is an object of the present invention to provide a method of and an apparatus for forming a thin, uniform film having a flat surface on the whole area of the surface of a specimen by utilizing low temperature plasma, even when the surface of the specimen is uneven. The present invention capable of attaining the above object utilizes both a phenomenon that a film is formed of ions incident upon a specimen surface, and a phenomenon that the side face of a protrusion on the film is scraped by ion bombardment. In more detail, according to the present invention, in order to form a thin, uniform film having a flat surface all over the surface of the specimen, a grid electrode is disposed between the low temperature plasma extracting aperture of the specimen chamber and the specimen table, and a potential applied to the gride electrode is controlled by control means so that the film forming action and protrusion scraping action of ions are simultaneously or alternately performed. The present invention will be explained below, by reference to Figs. 1 to 5 and 10. Fig. 1 shows an embodiment of a film formation apparatus according to the present invention, which is an improvement of the conventional film formation apparatus shown in Fig. 7. This embodiment is different from the conventional apparatus of Fig. 7 in that a ring shaped grid electrode 15 is disposed in the specimen chamber 7 at a position just under a plasma extracting aperture 7a which is provided at the boundary between the plasma formation chamber 3 and the specimen chamber 7, and the grid electrode 15 is applied with a bias potential from a variable power source 16. Explanation of common parts which are designated by the same reference numerals as those in Figs. 1 and 7, will be omitted for the sake of brevity. Now, the operation of the present embodiment will be explained below. When an insulating film is grown on the surface of the specimen 10 in a state that the bias potential is not applied to the grid electrode 15, the grown film 14 will have such a cross section as shown in Fig. 8. Thereafter, the supply of the film material gas 8 into the specimen chamber 7 is stopped, and a bias potential is applied to the grid electrode 15 so that ions contained in the plasma 6 which has been extracted from the plasma formation chamber 3 into the specimen chamber 7, are accelerated in directions toward the specimen 10. At this time, the moving direction of accelerated ions is oblique with respect to the side face or shoulder of a protrusion 14b on the grown film 14. Accordingly, the side of the protrusion 14b is seraped by ion bombardment progressively upto the boundaries shown by In the above explanation, after the insulating film has been grown on the surface of the specimen, the protrusion on the grown film is scraped to make the surface of the grown film flat. However, the processing for form ing a film having a flat surface on the uneven surface of the specimen is not limited to the above processing, but an appropriate bias potential may be applied to the grid electrode 15 during a period when the film is grown on the surface of the specimen, in order for the film form ing action and protrusion scraping action of ions to be simultaneously performed. In this case, the insulating film 14 having a flat surface can be obtained by a single process, and thus the control operation for forming a desired film will be simple. Alternatively, the potential of the grid electrode may be varied so that the film forming action and the protrusion scraping action are alternately and repeatedly performed in a period when the film 14 is grown on the specimen, to make uniform the grown film and to make flat the surface thereof. At b of Fig. 10 is shown the film forming process of the present embodiment for a case where the film forming action and protrusion scraping action of incident ions are simultaneously performed, and at a of Fig. 10 is shown the film forming process of the conven tional film formation apparatus of Fig. 6 or 7, for the sake of comparison. The insulating film formed by the conventional apparatus has a flat surface after the thickness of the film has become considerably large, as shown in part a of Fig. 10. While, the insulating film formed by the present embodiment has a flat surface even when the thickness of the film is small, as shown in part b of Fig. 10. Fig. 10 also shows the following facts. That is, when an insulating film is grown on a substrate having a wiring pattern thereon by the conventional apparatus, a coarse film may be formed over a groove between adjacent wiring conductors. When an insulating film is grown on the above substrate by the present embodiment, the grown film is uniform all over the surface of the substrate. Fig. 4 shows another embodiment of a film forma tion apparatus which utilizes low temperature plasma in accordance with the present invention. This embodiment is an improvement of the conventional film formation apparatus of Fig. 6 and is different therefrom in that the grid electrode 15 is disposed just under the plasma extracting aperture 7a and the potential of the grid electrode 15 is controlled by the variable power source 16. Fig. 5 shows a further embodiment of a film formation apparatus which utilizes low temperature plasma in accordance with the present invention. This embodiment is basically the same as the conventional apparatus of Fig. 7, excepting that a plurality of grid electrodes 15a and 15b are disposed just under the plasma extracting aperture 7a so as to form a multi stage grid electrode, and the grid electrodes 15a and 15b are connected to the variable power sources 16a and 16b, respectively, to control the potentials of the grid electrodes 15a and 15b independently of each other. In the embodiments of Figs. 4 and 5, the film forming action and protrusion scraping action of ions can be performed as in the embodiment of Fig. 1. As has been explained in the foregoing, accord ing to the present invention, the kinetic energy of ions incident upon a specimen is controlled so that the protrusion on a grown film is scraped by incident ions. Accordingly, even when the surface of the specimen is made uneven by a wiring pattern or others, a film having a flat surface can be formed on the uneven surface of the specimen, and the film is uniform all over the surface of the specimen without containing a coarse portion, which is apt to appear over a groove between adjacent wiring conductors when the film is formed by one of the conven tional film formation apparatuses. Further, according to the present invention, even a thin film formed on the specimen is uniform and has a flat surface.
