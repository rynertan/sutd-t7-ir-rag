# TRANSPONDER SYSTEMS

## Abstract
In a transponder system where a central interrogator transmits an electromagnetic field over an area in which transponders carried by moving objects are to be detected, the interrogator includes two coplanar antennae one arranged as a loop and the other in a figure of eight configuration, in order to generate fields at right angles to one another so that transponders can be detected regardless of their orientation. A phase shift may be introduced between the fields in order to generate a circulatory polar ized field.
