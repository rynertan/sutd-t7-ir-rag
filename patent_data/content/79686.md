# A soybean based fibrous food material having improved preservability and texture.

## Abstract
A soybean based fibrous food material improved in the preservability can be produced by incorporating polyhydric alcohol into soybean material. Said food material can be also improved in texture by incorporating metal cation in a form of edible salt and or an organic acid having 2 to 6 carbon atoms, with polyhydric alchohol into soybean material. The thus obtained soybean based fibrous food material is useful as an ingredient of meat product, fish meat product and so on.
