## Description
This invention relates to a process for reducing poisonous effects of metal contaminants such as iron, nickel, vanadium and the like, picked up by a hydrocarbon conversion catalyst during a hydrocarbon conversion process such as the high temperature conversion of a hydrocarbon feedstock containing such metals to a lower boiling product. More particularly, this invention relates to processes for reducing the poisonous effects of metal contaminants without removal of such contaminants from the catalyst, e.g., by a process of passivation. During a catalyst promoted chemical conversion involving a hydrocarbon containing metal contaminants such as iron, nickel, and vanadium, the catalyst may become more and more deactivated due to the pick up of at least a portion of the metal poisons. Removal of such poisons from the catalyst may restore a substantial amount of te catalytic activity.However, no matter how carefully the process for removing the metal poisons from the catalyst is carried out, some penalty in the form of overall performance is often paid. Accordingly, a simple and straight forward method for overcoming the deleterious effects of the metal poisons or contaminants is desirable. United States Patent 3,324,044 1967 discloses a method for restoring the catalytic activity of silica alumina catalysts that are contaminated with metals such as iron, nickel and vanadium. The method involves removal of metal contaminants from such catalysts py treating them at a temperature of at least 150F for at least 30 minutes with diluted aqueous solutions, which contain not more than 5 by weight of a watersoluble acidic aluminium salt and have a pH of from 2.0 to 5.5. Catalytically promoted methods for the chemical conversion of hydrocarbons include cracking, hydrocracking, reforming, hydrodenitrogenation, hydrodesulfurization, etc. Such reactions generally are performed at elevated temperatures, for example, about 300 to 12000F, more often 600 to 10Q0 F. Feedstocks to these processes comprise normally liquid or solid hydrocarbons which, at the temperature of the conversion reaction, are generally in a fluid, i.e., liquid or vapor, state and the products of the conversion usually are more valuable, lower boiling materials. Although referred to as metals , these catalyst contaminants may be present in the hydrocarbon feed in the form of free metals or relatively non volatile metal compounds. It is, therefore, to be understood that the term metal as used herein refers to either form. Various petroleum stocks have been known to contain at least traces of many metals. For example, MiddleEastern crudes contain relatively high amounts of several metal components, while Venezuelan crudes are noteworthy for their vanadium content and are relatively low in other contaminating metals such as nickel. In addition to metals naturally present in petroleum stocks, including some iron, petroleum stocks also have a tendency to pick up tramp iron from transportation, storage and processing equipment.Most of these metals, when present in a stock, deposit in a relatively non volatile form on the catalyst during conversion processes so that regeneration of the catalyst to remove deposited coke does not also remove these contaminants.With the increased importance of gasoline in the world today and the shortages of crude oils and increased prices, it is becoming more and more important to process any type or portions of a crude source, including those highly metal contaminated crudes to more valuable products. Of the various metals which are to be found in representative hydrocarbon feedstocks some, like the alkali metals, only deactivate the catalyst without changing the product distribution therefore, they might be considered true poisons. Others such as iron, nickel, vanadium, and copper markedly alter the selectivity and activity of cracking reactions if allowed to accumulate on the catalyst and, since they affect process performance, they are also referred to as poisons I. A poisoned catalyst with these metals generally produces a higher yield of coke and hydrogen at the expense of desired products, such as gasoline and butanes.For instance, United States Patent 3,147,228 reports that it has been shown that the yield of butanes, butenes and gasoline, based on converting 60 volume percent of cracking feed to lighter materials and coke dropped from 58.5 to 49.6 volume percent when the amount of nickel on the catalyst increased from 55 ppm to 645 ppm and the amount of vanadium increased from 145 ppm to 1480 ppm in a fluid catalytic cracking of a feedstock containing some metal contaminated stocks. Since many cracking units are limited by coke burning or gas handling facilities, increased coke or gas yields require a reduction in conversion or throughput to stay within the unit capacity. The present invention is particularly suitable for passivating poisons in a catalyst utilized in the catalytic cracking of reduced or topped crude oils to more valuable products such as illustrated in U.S. Patents 3,092,568 and 3,164,542. The teachings of which are incorporated by reference herein. Similarly, this invention is applicable to processing shale oils, tar sands oil, coal oils and the like where metal contamination of the.processing, e.g., cracking, catalyst can occur. It is an object of this invention to improve the performance of a hydrocarbon conversion catalyst by reducing the poisonous effects of metals present in a hydrocarbon feedstock. It is an object of this invention to provide a simple and straight forward process for reducing the poisonous effects on a chemical conversion catalyst due to metal contaminants present in a hydrocarbon feedstock than would otherwise occur during a chemical conversion process of such a hydrocarbon feedstock. Other objects of this invention will be clear based upon this disclosure. An alternative to letting the unpassivated metals level of a conversion catalyst increase and activity and desired selectivity decrease is to diminish the overall unpassivated metals content on the catalyst by raising catalyst replacement rates. Either approach, letting unpassivated metals level increase, or increasing catalyst replacement rates, must be balanced against product value and operating costs to determine the most economic way of operating. The optimum unpassivated metals level at which to operate any cracking unit will be a function of many factors including feedstock metal content, type and cost of catalyst, overall refinery balance, etc., and can be determined by a comprehensive study of the refinery s operations.With the high cost of both catalyst and the hydrocarbon feedstock today, it is increasingly disadvantageous to discard catalyst or convert hydrocarbon feedstocks to coke or gas. It has been discovered that by treating a conversion catalyst containing a metal contaminant such as iron, copper, nickel and or vanadium with aluminium compounds, preferably followed by calcination, the apparent poisonous effects of freshly deposited metal contaminants upon a hydrocarbon conversion catalyst are significantly reduced. Several methods for treating such a contaminated catalyst have been found to be surprisingly effective. Solid oxide catalysts have long been recognized as useful in catalytically promoting the conversion of hydrocarbons. For hydrocarbon cracking processes carried out in the substantial absence of added free molecular hydrogen, suitable catalysts which are usually activated or calcined, are predominately silica or silica based, e.g., silica alumina, silica magnesia, silicazirconia, etc., compositions in a state of slight hydration containing small amounts of acidic oxide promoters in many instances. The oxide catalyst may contain a substantial amount of a gel or gelatinous precipitate comprising a major portion of silica and at least one other inorganic oxide material, such as alumina, zirconia, etc. These oxides may also contain small amounts of other inorganic materials. The use of wholly or partially synthetic gel or gelatinous catalyst, which are uniform and little damaged by high temperatures in treatment and regenerating, is often preferable. Also suitable are hydrocarbon cracking catalysts which include a catalytically effective amount of at least one natural or synthetic zeolite, e.g., crystalline alumino silicate. A preferred catalyst is one that includes at least one zeolite to provide a high activity catalyst. Suitable amounts of zeolite in the catalyst are in the range of about 1 758 by weight.Preferred are zeolite amounts of about 2 30 by weight of the total catalyst. Catalysts which can withstand the conditions of both hydrocarbon cracking and catalyst regenerating are suitable for use in the process of this invention. For example, a phosphate silica alumina silicate composition is shown in USP 3,867,279, chrysotile catalysts are shown in USP 3,868,316, zeolite beta type of catalyst is shown in USP Re. 28,j41, The catalyst may be only partially of synthetic material for example, it may be made by the precipitation of silica alumina on clay, such as kaolinite or halloysite. One such semi synthetic catalyst contains about equal amounts of silica alumina gel and clay. The manufacture of synthetic gel catalyst is conventional, well known in the art and can be performed, for instance 1 by impregnating silica with aluminia salts 2 by direct combination of precipitated or gelated hydrated alumina and silica in appropriate proportions or 3 by joint precipitation of alumina and silica from an aqueous solution of aluminum and silicon salts.Synthetic catalyst may be produced by a combination of hydrated silica with other hydrate bases as, for instance, zirconia, etc.These synthetic gel type catalysts may be activated or calcined before use. A particularly preferred catalyst contains a catalytically effective amount of a decationized zeolitic molecular sieve having less than 90 of the aluminium atoms associated with cations, a crystalline structure capable of internally absorbing benzene and a SiO2 to A1203 molar ratio greater than 3. Such catalysts are illustrated in United States Patent 3,236,761, the teachings of which are incorporated by reference herein. The physical form of the catalyst is not critical to the present invention and may, for example, vary with the type of manipulative process in which it will be used. The catalyst may be used as a fixed bed or in a circulating system. In a fixedbed process, a single reaction zone or a series of catalytic reaction zones may be used. If a series of reactors are used, one is usually on stream and others are in the process of cleaning or regenerating and the like. In circulating catalyst systems, such as those of the fluid bed or moving bed catalytic processes, catalyst moves through a reaction zone and then through a regeneration zone. In a fluid bed cracking process, gases are used to convey the catalyst and to keep it in the form of a dense turbulent bed which has no definite upper interface between the dense solid phase the suspended gaseous phase mixture of catalyst and gas.This type of processing requires the catalyst to be in the form of a fine powder, e.g., a major amount by weight of which being in a size range of about 20 to 150 microns. In other processes, e.g., moving bed catalytic cracking system, the catalyst can be in the form of macrosize particles such as spherical beads which are conveyed between the reaction zone and the catalyst regeneration zone. These beads may range in size up to about 1 2 in diameter. When fresh, the minimum size bead is preferably about 1 8 . Other physical forms of catalyst such as tablets, extruded pellets, Microspheroids 5 100 , etc. can be used. In this invention, the hydrocarbon petroleum oils utilized as feedstock for a given conversion process may be of any desired type normally utilized in such hydrocarbon conversion operations.The feedstock may contain nickel, iron and or vanadium as well as other metals. As indicated, the catalyst may be used to promote the desired hydrocarbon conversion by employing at least one fixed bed, moving bed or fluidized bed dense or dilute phase of such catalyst. Bottoms from hydrocarbon processes, i.e., reduced crude and residuum stocks are particularly highly contaminated with these metals and therefore rapidly poison catalysts used in converting bottoms to more valuable products. For example, a bottom may contain about 100 1500 ppm Ni, about 100 2500 ppm V and about 100 3000 ppm Fe. For typical operations, the catalytic cracking of the hydrocarbon feed would often result in a conversion of about 10 to 80 by volume of the feedstock into lower boiling, more valuable products. A unique feature of this invention involves a transfer of aluminium containing species from a treating medium to a catalyst poisoned by metal contaminants. As a result of such transfer, rather than demetallization as disclosed in U.S. 3,324,044 1967 discussed hereinbefore, the deleterious effects from the metal contaminants are surprisingly reduced. Broadly, this invention is an improvement to a conventional conversion process. A conventional conversion process involves contacting a hydrocarbon feedstock in a reaction zone at hydrocarbon conversion conditions with a catalyst to form a conversion product and a deactivated catalyst which has carbonaceous deposits and contains at least a portion of the metal contaminants originally present in the hydrocarbon feedstock. The deactivated catalyst is typically regenerated to restore at least a portion of its catalytic activity by removing under controlled conditions at least a portion of said carbonaceous deposits to form a regenerated catalyst. An example of a conversion process is cracking of hydrocarbon feedstocks to produce hydrocarbons of preferred octane rating boiling in the gasoline range. A variety of solid oxide catalysts is widely used to give end products of fairly uniform composition. Cracking is ordinarily effected to produce gasoline as the most valuable product and is generally conducted at temperatures of about 750 to 11000F, preferably about 850 to 9500F, at pressures up to about 2000 psig, preferably about atmospheric to 100 psig and without substantial addition of free hydrogen to the system. In cracking, the feedstock is usually a petroleum hydrocarbon fraction such as straight run or recycle gas oils or other normally liquid hydrocarbons boiling above the gasoline range. Recently, low severity cracking conditions have been employed for heavily contaminated feedstocks such as crude or reduced crude where the conversion is not made directly to the most valuable, lower boiling products, i.e., gasoline boiling range products, but to intermediate type hydrocarbon conversion products which may be later refined to the more desirable, lower boiling, gasoline or fuel oil fractions. High severity cracking has also been practiced for the conversion of such feedstocks to light, normally gaseous hydrocarbons, such as ethane, propane or butane. An example of a regeneration procedure is one wherein the catalyst is contacted periodically with free oxygencontaining gas in order to restore or maintain the activity of the catalyst by removing at least a portion of the carbonaceous deposits from the catalyst which form during hydrocarbon conversion. However, in those processes not having a regeneration step, the catalyst can be subjected to a regenerating step after the removal of the catalyst from the process. It will be understood that regeneration involves a carbonaceous material burn off procedure. Ordinarily, the catalyst is taken from the hydrocarbon conversion system and treated before the poisoning metals have reached an undesirably high level, for instance, above about 0.5 by weight, on catalyst and preferably less than about 10 maximum, content of nickel, iron and vanadium.More preferably, the catalyst is removed when the nickel, iron, and vanadium content is less than about 5 by weight and most preferably when the catalyst contains about 0.75 to about 2 by weight nickel, iron, and vanadium. Generally speaking, when the hydrocarbon conversion levels are more than about 50 by volume of the feedstock conversion, the amount of metals tolerated on the catalyst is less. On the other hand, low conversion levels are, i.e., less than about 50 by volume conversion, tolerate higher amounts of metals on the catalyst. The actual time or extent of the regeneration thus depends on various factors and is dependent on, for example, the extent of metals content in the feed, the level of conversion, unit tolerance for poison, the sensitivity of the particular catalyst toward the passivation procedure used to reduce the poisonous effects of metals upon the catalyst, etc. Regeneration of a hydrocarbon cracking catalyst to remove carbonaceous deposit material is conventional and well known in the art. For example, in a typical fluidized bed cracking unit, a portion of catalyst is continually being removed from the reactor and sent to the regenerator for contact with an oxygen containing gas at about 950 to about 12200F, preferably about 1000 to about 11500F. Combustion of carbonaceous deposits from the catalyst is rapid, and, for reasons of economy, air is used to supply the needed oxygen. Average residence time for a catalyst particle in the regenerator can be on the order of about three to one hundred minutes, preferably about three minutes to sixty minutes and the oxygen content of the effluent gases from the regenerator is desirably less than about 0.5 weight percent.When later oxygen treatment is employed, the regeneration of any particular quantity of catalyst is generally regulated to give a carbon content remaining on the catalyst of less than about 0.5 weight percent. At least a portion of the regenerated catalyst is then returned to the reaction zone. Calcination of a hydrocarbon cracking catalyst involves heating at high temperatures, e.g., 950 to 12000F, in a molecular oxygen containing gas. The temperature preferably is at least about 500F higher than the regeneration temperature, but below a temperature where the catalyst undergoes any substantial deleterious change in its physical or chemical characteristics.The catalyst is in a substantially carbon free condition during a calcination treatment, because the burning off of any significant amount of carbon on the catalyst would lead to, at least in the area where such carbon was located, the evolution of such amounts of heat energy that the catalyst near such evolution of heat energy would very likely be damaged. The improved process of this invention comprises contacting a regenerated catalyst with a liquid medium containing an effective amount, to be discussed in more detail hereinafter, of one or more aluminium compounds which are at least in part soluble within said liquid medium. The time of contacting is sufficient to permit a sufficient amount of the aluminium compounds to react with said regenerated catalyst to form a treated catalyst and optionally, but preferably, separating the treated catalyst from at least a portion of said liquid medium and transferring at least a portion of the treated catalyst to a reaction zone.The transfer of treated catalyst to the reaction zone is intended to include both direct and or indirect transfer to the reaction zone. For example, the treated catalyst can be returned to the regenerator, or a zone for calcination, or to the hydrocarbon feedstock prior to and or substantially simultaneously with that feedstock being introduced into the reaction zone. The time of contact is sufficient to permit a sufficient amount of the aluminium compounds to react with said regenerated catalyst to form a treated catalyst. The effective amount of one or more aluminium compounds dissolved in the liquid medium cannot be precisely defined, but it is preferably an amount which results in the treated catalyst having an atomic ratio of aluminium atoms, from said one or more aluminium compounds, to total number of atoms of metal contaminants in the catalyst in the range of about 0.01 to about 3, and preferably in the range of about 0.05 to about 1. Atomic ratio of a first specie to a second specie means, throughout this specification and claims, the ratio of the total number of atoms of the first specie, regardless of any oxidation state or states therein, to the total number of atoms of the second specie, regardless of any oxidation state or states therein. For example, when the concentration of contaminating metals, calculated as a respective element thereof, in the catalyst is within the range of about 0.2 to about 3.58 by weight, as based upon the total weight of the catalyst, a particularly useful liquid, e.g., water, medium concentration in moles liter of aluminium species, calculated as based on elemental aluminium, is adjusted to be in the range of about .03 moles liter to about 1 mole liter of aluminium. The percent by weight of catalyst in a slurry of such a liquid medium is not critical, but is preferably in the range of about 10 to 40 percent by weight. The liquid medium referred to above can be either an aqueous medium or an organic medium. Both the aqueous medium and the organic medium should be substantially free from contaminating metals such as discussed earlier. The term, substantially free means, throughout this specification and claims, present in a concentration sufficiently low so as not to contaminate a catalyst treated by such a medium to a degree that measurably and adversely degrades the selectivity and or activity of the catalyst so treated. Examples of such aqueous media are distilled water and deionized water. Examples of suitable organic media are petroleum distillates, liquid hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene, naphthenes and the like. Examples of suitable aluminium. compounds which have been found particularly effective in an aqueous solution treatment of a conversion catalyst are Al NO3 3, A12 S04 3, Alp4, A1 C6H50 3, Al Ac 3 wherein Ac is acetate, NH4 A1 SO4 2, Al BrO3 3,Al C103 3, Al C104 3, Al C2H50 3, Al lactate, Al oleate and AlX3 where each X is individually selected from the group of halogens consisting of F, C1, Br and I. Generally, any aluminium compound which is at least partially soluble or sparingly soluble in an organic medium can be used to contact a regenerated catalyst or which is soluble or sparingly soluble in the hydrocarbon feed can be used. For a material to be sparingly soluble in a solvent means at least 0.01 grams of that material can be dissolved in 100 milliliters of solvent.Some examples of organic compounds that can be used are diketonates sulfonates dithiophosphates alkoxides carboxylates having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms such as stearates and oleates phenoxides naphthenates aluminium hydrocarbyls, such as alkyls consisting of hydrogen and carbon, having the formula R3A1 wherein each R individually contains from 1 to 20 carbon atoms organic aluminium halides having the formula RnAlX3 n wherein n can have values of 1 or 2 and each R is individually selected from a group consisting of hydrocarbyl and halogen substituted hydrocarbyl material having up to 20 carbon atoms wherein the halogen is individually selected from fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine organic oxyaluminium having the formula RnA1 R 0 3 n wherein each R and R individually is selected from a group consisting of hydrocarbyl and halogen substituted hydrocarbyl materials having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms and wherein n is an integer in the range of from 0 to 3 carbonyls, metallocenes, hydrocarbyl, such as alkyl and aryl and halogen substituted hydrocarbyl phosphine and phosphite complexes wherein the hydrocarbyl has 1 to 20 carbon atoms aluminium oxalates aluminium acetates aluminium diethylmalonate aluminium l phenolsulfonates and aluminium halides wherein the halide is selected from a group of halides consisting of fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine and mixtures thereof. Another advantageous method for treating a metal contaminated catalyst with one or more aluminium compounds in an aqueous phase is to induce a phase separation of the aluminiumcontaining species or materials from the aqueous phase. An example of an effective means for inducing such a phase separation is to precipitate at least a portion of the aluminiumcontaining materials by adjusting the pH range of the aqueous phase. The precipitate includes several important hydrated forms of alumina, AlOOH boehmite and naturally occurring mineral forms, along with a true hydroxide, A1 OH 3. For example, a pH change of the aqueous phase from a value in the range of about 2 to about 5 to a value in the range of about 7 to about 8 has been found particularly effective. In still another method, a conventional conversion process is improved by contacting a regenerated catalyst with an organic solution containing an effective amount of one or more aluminium compounds dissolved therein. The treated catalyst is then separated from the organic liquid and optionally calcined before being returned, e.g., directly or indirectly, as discussed earlier, to the reaction zone. Two examples of methods for separating the treated catalyst from the organic phase are evaporation of the organic phase or filtration. A suitable calcining temperature for a treated catalyst is generally in the range of about 900QF to about 14500F and more preferably in the range of about 9500F to about 12500F.One limitation on the temperature for calcination is due to the fact that the catalyst must not be adversely affected from heating. Still another method for passivating the poisonous effects of metal contaminants on a conversion catalyst is to introduce into a hydrocarbon feed of a conventional conversion process at least one partially soluble aluminium compound before, after or substantially simultaneous with contacting said catalyst in said reaction zone. In this method there is no need to separately calcine the catalyst as the substantially simultaneous deposition of both aluminium and other metal contaminants within the hydrocarbon feedstock have been found to surprisingly work together to maintain the activity of the conversion catalyst. The atomic ratio of all aluminium atoms to all metal contaminants in the hydrocarbon feed has an impact upon the observed results. For example, if the ratio is much in excess of 3, then the catalytic activity of the catalyst will be adversely affected.If, on the other hand, the ratio is much less than about 0.05, then the observed benefits are correspondingly lessened. Generally, some benefits of this invention are obtained when the atomic ratio of all aluminium atoms to all metal contaminants in the hydrocarbon feed is in the range of about 0.05 to about 3, and preferably when the ratio is in the range of about 0.3 to about 1. Examples of processing conditions useful in carrying out a process of this invention are set out hereinafter.Contacting times between a catalyst and a liquid medium for aqueous media are generally in the range of from about half a second to about twenty minutes and preferably in the range of from about two minutes to about ten minutes. Contacting times for an organic medium are about the same as for an aqueous medium, but often depend upon the rate at which the organic medium can be evaporated off, and hence are not simply definable. The temperature of the contacting medium, e.g., organic and aqueous media, can be any where from about ambient or room temperature 72 F to the boiling point of the contacting medium. Temperature is not critical and may, in fact, be below room temperature, but we have found no reason for cooling in order to obtain the benefits from a process of this invention. It has further been found that contact with oxidative washes, i.e., an aqueous solution containing an oxidizing agent or an agent capable of accepting electrons, has a beneficial effect of further improving the catalytic activity of an aluminiumtreated or aluminium passivated conversion catalyst which contains metal contaminants. The wash refers to a treatment which may be carried out in a variety of ways, e.g., batch operation, semi continuous or continuous operation with or without counter currents. The aluminium passivated catalyst is contacted with the oxidative wash solution for a time sufficient to cause an interaction between the solution and catalyst that results in a measurable benefit.The amount of metal contaminants removed from the conversion catalyst by these oxidative washes is generally very small and apparently works by a mechanism different from that of a demetallization process such as disclosed in U.S.Patents 4,102,811 1978 4,163,709 1979 , and 4,163,710 1979 , which patents are expressly incorporated herein by reference. A preferred oxidative wash medium comprises a solution of hydrogen peroxide in water. Other oxidizing agents which may be used include air, oxygen, ozone, perchlorates, organic hydroperoxides, organic peroxides, organic peracids, inorganic peroxyacids such as peroxymonosulfuric and peroxydisulfuric acid, singlet oxygen, NO2, N204, N2O3, superoxides and the like.Typical examples of organic oxidants are hydroxyheptyl peroxide, cyclohexanone peroxide, tertiary butyl peracetate, di tertiary butyl diperphthalate, tertiary butyl perbenzoate, methyl ethyl hydroperoxide, di tertiary butyl peroxide, p methyl benzene hydroperoxide, naphthylhydroperoxide, tertiary butyl hydroperoxide, pinane hydroperoxide, 2, 5 dimethylhexane 2, 5 dihydroperoxide, cumene hydroperoxide, tertiary butyl hydroperoxide and the like as well as organic peracids such as performic acid, peracetic acid, trichloroperacetic acid, perchloric acid, periodic acid, perbenzoic acid, perphthalic acid and the like including salts thereof.Ambient oxidative wash temperatures can be used, but temperatures of about 1500F to the boiling point of the aqueous solution in combination with agitation are helpful in increasing dispersibility or removability of the metal poisons. Preferred temperatures are about 680F to about 2039F. The hydrogen peroxide solution preferably containing about 2 to 30 weight hydrogen peroxide, can be added to an aqueous catalyst slurry as described earlier at about 680 2030F, preferably 770 1850F and allowed to react for a time sufficient to provide useful results. Preferred wash times are about 1 5 minutes. A concentration of H2O2 in the range of about 5 50 lb., preferably about 10 20 lb. of H202 ton of catalyst is preferably used. Additional oxidative washes can be used to ensure the restoration of catalytic properties. In addition, the oxidative washing can be carried out either in the presence of or absence of a mineral acid such as HC1, HNO3 or H2SO4.Preferably the pH of the oxidative wash medium is about 2 to about 7. U.S. Patent 4,101,444 1978 discloses suitable oxidative washes and is expressly incorporated herein by reference. After the catalyst is washed, the catalyst slurry can be filtered to give a cake. The cake may be reslurried one or more times with water or rinsed in other ways, such as, for example, by a water wash of the filter cake. After the washing and rinsing treatment, the catalyst is transferred to a hydrocarbon conversion system, for instance, to a catalyst regenerator. The catalyst may be returned as a slurry in the final aqueous wash medium, or it may be desirable first to dry the catalyst filter cake or filter cake slurry at, for example, about 2150F to 3200F, under a vacuum. Also, prior to reusing the catalyst in the conversion operation it can be calcined, for example, at temperatures usually in the range of about 7000F to about 13000F. The catalyst may also be slurried with hydrocarbons and added back to the reactor vessel, if desired. The following examples are intended to be illustrative of the invention of this disclosure. However, many variations based on the teachings of this disclosure are readily apparent to one skilled in the art and are intended to be within the scope of this invention. The examples should not be used to unnecessarily restrict the nature and scope of this invention. EXAMPLE I A Phillips Borger equilibrium silica alumina zeolitecontaining catayst is used. This catalyst includes about 5 by weight of a crystalline aluminium silicate effective to promote hydrocarbon cracking having an initial catalytic activity as follows Catalytic Activity MA CPR H2 CH4 Original Catalyst 80 0.75 8 The catalyst was used in a fluid catalytic cracking conversion of a hydrocarbon feedstock containing iron, nickel, copper, and vanadium. The contaminated catalyst was removed from the hydrocarbon conversion stream and regenerated to remove carbon under conventional regeneration conditions, so as to have less than about 0.5 by weight of carbon.The regenerated catalyst had a catalytic activity, surface area in units of square meters per gram and a metal contamination shown in the following 8 Metal Catalytic Surface Contaminants Activity Area Ni Fe V MA CPF H2 CH4 Total Zeolite 0.33 0.72 0.71 59.1 3.02 20.0 99 22 Areas in square meters per gram were determined by nitrogen adsorption according to ASTM D3663 1978 . Total areas were calculated by the BET method, zeolite areas were calculated following a procedure disclosed by M. F. L. Johnson in The Journal of Catalysis, 1978, V. 52, pg. 425. 20 grams of the regenerated equilibrium catalyst was added to 80 mls of an aluminium nitrate solution. The aluminium nitrate solution contains 2.43 grams of aluminium nitrate, A1 NO3 3 9H2O, dissolved in 80 grams of water which had a pH adjusted to 3.5 to 7.05 by suitable addition of potassium hydroxide. The 20 by weight aqueous slurry produced was agitated for about 40 minutes at ambient temperature about 720F . The catalyst was separated by filtration from a clear supernatant liquid.The catalyst was then air dried in an oven for about 12 hours at a temperature in the range of about 1760F to about 2120F. The oven dried catalyst was then calcined by heating in an oven which was at an initial temperature of about 720F and heated over a period of about 30 to 60 minutes to 10000F and then maintained at 10000F for an additional 5 hours. The results of this processing is given as Entry 1 of the following table entitled Passivation ofMetal Poisoned FCC Catalyst , hereinafter referred to as TABLE 1. With respect to Entry 2 of TABLE 1, the catalyst ofEntry 1 was further treated with a peroxide H202 wash. The peroxide wash treatment comprised forming a 20 by weight slurry of the treated catalyst in a 5 by weight peroxide solution.The overall weight of peroxide per weight catalyst was about 10 to 20 pounds of peroxide H202 per ton of catalyst. The time required for the peroxide treatment was 2 to 5 minutes of agitation followed by a water rinse and an oven drying as described above.The results of this processing is given as Entry 2 of TABLE 1. With respect to Entry 3 of TABLE 1, a regeneratedPhillips Borger equilibrium catalyst of Entry 1 was water washed.Water washing comprised forming a 20 by weight slurry with agitation. The time for contacting the catalyst with water is kept brief so as to avoid redeposition of solubilized vanadium onto the catalyst. The water washed catalyst was then air dried in an oven for about 12 hours at a temperature in the range of about 1760 to 2120F, 20 grams of the oven dried catalyst was then suspended with agitation in a toluene solution comprising 0.73 grams of C2H5 3A1 and 80 grams of toluene. The agitation was continued for 20 minutes under N2 and the toluene solution temperature was about 720F. The catalyst was then separated from the toluene phase by evaporation and air dried in an oven for about 12 hours at a temperature in the range of about 200 to about 2500F.The oven dried catalyst was then calcined by heating in an oven which was at a temperature of about 11000F for about 4 hours. The calcined catalyst was then treated with a peroxide H202 solution in the manner described with respect to Entry 2.The results of this processing is shown in TABLE 1 as Entry 3. With respect to Entry 4, a Phillips Borger equilibrium catalyst which on regeneration had a metals contamination of 0.46 by weight nickel, 0.37 by weight iron, and 1.67 by weight vanadium as based on the total weight of catalyst and had a catalytic activity of 55.3 MA, 5.10 CPF, and 30.6 H2 CH4, was treated with an aqueous solution of aluminium sulfate. 20 grams of this catalyst was suspended with agitation in an aluminium sulfate solution consisting of 4.74 grams of aluminium sulfateA12 SO4 3 9 H20 and 100 grams of water. The temperature of the aluminium sulfate solution was 1760F, and the agitation was continued for 30 minutes. The catalyst was isolated by filtration and dried in an air oven as described above and calcined at 11000F for 6 hours. The results of this processing is shown in TABLE 1 as Entry 4. The treated catalyst of Entry 4 was further calcined by heating at 13000F for 4 hours. The results of this processing is shown as Entry 5. With respect to Entry 6, the catalyst of Entry 5 was treated with a peroxide H202 wash as described above.

The atomic ratio of Al in solution to total metal contaminants in the catalyst was approximately 2 1. The slurried mixture was vigorously agitated on a shaker under reflux conditions for 20 minutes.The initial pH of the system, 2.86 increased to 3.05 during this treatment. The resulting system was filtered washed thoroughly with water until the presence of aluminium in the filtrate was no longer observed. The catalyst treated in this manner was dried under a high vacuum at 2480F, and further calcined at 11000F for 6 hours. Catalytic activities for the dried and dried calcined catalyst are listed as la and 2a, respectively in TABLE 2. The same procedure was employed, but with an aqueous solution of A12 SO4 3 at ambient temperatures for 1 hour.The pH of the system was 3.46 before the filtration was made.The catalyst, washed thoroughly, was calcined at 9500F for 4 hours.

The system was agitated on the shaker slurry at ambient temperature about 720F for two hours, and CC14 was evaporated off to obtain dried solid catalyst. The resulting catalyst was further calcined at 10000F for six hours. Results are listed as Entry 1 of TABLE 3. EXAMPLE IV The Phillips Borger equilibrium catalyst of EXAMPLE I was treated with a toluene solution of tri isobutyl aluminium.20 g of the equilibrium catalyst was vigorously agitated in a solution containing 1.28 g of iBu 3 Al dissolved in 70 ml toluene, under an inert atmosphere of N2 for 20 minutes. Toluene was evaporated to yield a solid catalyst. This catalyst was isolated and later calcined at 11000F for six hours. Results are shown as Entry 2 of TABLE 3. The calcined catalyst was further tested with an aqueous solution of H202 twice 50 H202 ton catalyst at 1850F for 4 minutes. The resulting catalyst was dried. The catalytic activity and metal levels were determined.The results are summarized in 3 of TABLE 3.

Dried catalyst 20g was slurried in a toluene solution of ethylaluminium sesquichloride, 0.78 g Et3A12C13 in 60 mls of toluene and allowed to interact for 30 minutes at ambient temperature 720F under a N2 stream.Toluene was then evaporated to yield a treated catalyst which was calcined at 11000F for 4 hours and was further washed with an aqueous H2O2 solution. Results are listed as Entry 4 ofTABLE 3. EXAMPLE VI In a plant, a metal passivation operation is carried out in connection with an FCC process to mitigate the detrimental effect of metals such as nickel, iron, vanadium, and copper.In the first cracking regeneration zone, which is a heavy oil cracking unit, 54,800 barrels per stream day of reduced crude oil are cracked. The reduced crude oil is topped North Slope crude and it contains about 23 ppm nickel and 48 ppm vanadium. sn oil solution of aluminium isopropoxide is injected for passivation purposes into the fixed stream to this heavy oil cracker. As a general rule, the atomic ratio of aluminium compound injected, calculated as elemental aluminium, to the contaminating metals introduced into the process by ways of the feedstock is 1. The cracked product withdrawn from the cracking unit is introduced into a separator in which this product stream containing some cracking catalyst fines is separated into hydrocarbons that are essentially free of catalyst fines. The hydrogen production, as well as coke formation, are significantly reduced by this process and the gasoline yields are increased. The same catalyst can be operated at higher levels of metal contaminants without sacrificing yield and selectivity of desired liquid products for a prolonged period.
