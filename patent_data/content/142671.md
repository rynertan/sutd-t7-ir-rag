# Method and apparatus for photoepilation.

## Abstract
The certain quantity of light energy sufficient to effect lifelessness in each of a particular type of hairs is provided to the tip of a hand held probe 18 each time a switch, 22 is closed, independent of the duration of the switch closure. A foot switch 22 is actuated to provide a series of timed and spaced pulses of light energy for a period selectable by rotat ing a wiper of a variable resistor capacitor circuit. The sum of the energies of the pulses over the selected period equals the certain quantity of light energy. Alternatively, four foot switches can be provided, one of which can be depressed to provide one of four fixed periods of light pulses. Commonly, the certain quantity of light energy is first determined for the hair type and then that certain quantity is used for all the hairs of that type to be removed.
