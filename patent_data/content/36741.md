# Phosphine compounds, transition metal complexes thereof and use thereof as chiral hydrogenation catalysts.

## Abstract
The chiral phosphine ligand R 1,2 bis diphenylphosphi no 1 cyclohexylethane, when complexed to a transition metal such as Rh I , functions as a superior chiral hydrogenation ca talyst. The chiral phosphine ligand is more stereochemically ri gid than previous compounds consequently, virtually optically pure materials can be produced from the chiral hydrogenation of prochiral compounds using the catalyst of this invention. This catalyst is especially useful in the chiral hydrogenation of alpha acylamido acrylic acids.
