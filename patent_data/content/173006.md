# Segmented fret electronic musical instrument.

## Abstract
An electronic stringed musical instrument 10 having an electrically insulating fingerboard 16 is disclosed. The fingerboard is provided with a number of 17, 19, 21 frets across its upper surface at desired points along its length. Each of the frets includes a number of electrically conduct ing fret segments a, b, c, d which are electrically insulated from one another. The instrument 10 has electrically con ductive strings 1, 2, 3, 4 each disposed adjacent to and associated with a respective single fret segment of each of the segmented frets. A top octave generator 100 and di viders 135 are utilised to provide the fret segments selec tively with electrical signals of respective frequencies. Dis placing a string to contact a fret segment completes an electrical circuit to pass to an output a signal of the re spective frequency which is converted to a corresponding musical note by an appropriate sound reproducing device.
