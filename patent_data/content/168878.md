# Magnetic tape cassette apparatus comprising a servo device.

## Abstract
In a magnetic tape cassette apparatus comprising a servo device 39 for actuating at least one part 6 of the ap paratus, the servo device comprises a servo wheel 40 , a relay armature member 42 and an impulse relay 44 . The servo wheel is provided with circumferential teeth and two untoothed circumferential portions 49, 50 which in the rest positon of the servo wheel face a gear wheel 45 which is driven by a motor 16 . The servo wheel 40 further carries a cam 46 and at least one latching projection 47, 48 , a starting torque being exerted on the cam 46 in the rest po sition. The relay armature member 42 is pivotable be tween a latching position and an inoperative position and comprises a rigid arm 52 and an elastically deflexible arm, which near its free end carries a rigid support 58 which supports a soft iron element 49 and a coupling element 58
