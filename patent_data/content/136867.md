# Rollers with oriented fibre reinforcement and method of making them.

## Abstract
A roller 80 for use in the cargo bay of an aircraft is constructed with an outer surface layer 50 of rubber bonded about a cylindrical hub 60 , the outer surface layer having chopped fibre strands 40 incorporated into the rubber and orientated in a substantially circumferential direction around the hub of the roller to provide reinforce ment to the rubber portion 50 of the roller. The outer surface layer 50 may be formed as two semi cylindrical pads 50 bonded to the outer surface of the hub 60 .
