The salts also include quaternary ammonium salts such as those formed from alkyl or aralkyl halides. The compounds of formula I possess antiulcer and or anti secretory activity as measured by standard test procedures and accordingly are useful for the treatment of ulcers or hypersecretion in mammals. Anti ulcer activity was determined by the stress induced erosion test of Senay and Levine, Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med., Male rats, weighing between 80 and 120 gms. were fasted overnight with water After 30 minutes the rats were inserted into aluminium restraining tubes measuring 1⁵ ₈ inches in diameter by 5 inches and placed in the cold 4 1 C for 3 hours. Immediately after cold exposure the rats were killed with intracranial alcohol and their stomachs excised and opened along the greater curvature. Each stomach was washed gently free of contents with warm tap water and pinned out on a board. The condition of the gastric mucosa was then scored from 0 to 6 on the following scale The maximum possible score for each animal was 6 and for the group 36. Decrease in ulcer formation was calculated as a percentage of the control score, i.e. The statistical significance of the effect is assessed by Student s t test. Experience has shown that 45 inhibition may be taken as a threshold value below which compounds can be regarded as inactive or not sufficiently active to be considered further. In the above mentioned test the following representative compounds of formula I were particularly active giving results as shown Antisecretory activity was demonstrated by the test of H. Shay, D.Sun and H. Gruenstein, Gastroenterology. 1954, Compounds of formula I were also tested for anti secretory activity by their ability to inhibit the highly specific proton transporting enzyme H K ATPase. Potential H K ATPase inhibitors were evaluated by a technique involving the measurement of aminopyrine accumulation in rabbit isolated gastric glands. Aminopyrine accumulates in acid secreting cells therefore, uptake of aminopyrine is increased by secretagogues and an inhibitor of acid secretion will reduce the response to one or more secretagogues depending upon its site of action. Compounds which reduce the response to dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate DBcAMP stimulation are assumed to have an intracellular site of action, and those which reduce the response to both DBcAMP and high potassium ion concentration K are thought to have an intracellular site of action at the secretory surface of the parietal cell, involving the highly specific proton transporting enzyme, H K ATPase. Compounds are tested at a concentration of 10 ⁴M, initially, and in some cases at lower concentrations, for their ability to inhibit ¹⁴C aminopyrine uptake in gastric glands, stimulated by DBcAMP and high K respectively. Results are expressed as the inhibition of the maximum response to the secretagogue induced by the test compound. An inhibitor of H K ATPase would be expected to reduce the response to both secretagogues. In the above test the following compounds of formula I were particularly active giving the results shown This invention also provides processes for preparing the novel compounds of formula I. In general the compounds may be prepared by processes which are known or are analogous to known processes see literature references hereinbefore disclosed. A first process for preparing compounds of formula I comprises cyclising a compound of formula wherein B B¹ , n, m, R, R¹, R², R³,R⁴,R⁵ and R⁶ are as defined above, and X is OH or a leaving group such as halogen or an aryl , alkyl or aralkyl sulphonyloxy group that couples B to nitrogen, providing that Compound of formula II can in general be prepared by reacting an appropriate 2 chlorobenzimidazole with a compound of formula wherein R, B B¹ and X are as hereinbefore defined and if desired oxidising the product, e.g. using a peroxyorganic acid such as peroxybenzoic acids. Compounds of formula II as hereinbefore defined wherein X if OH, B B¹ has the formula Ic wherein n us O enol form of ketone or formula Ib may be prepared by reacting the appropriate 2 mercaptobenzimidazole with a haloketone or aldehyde of formula IIIa or IIIb. wherein R, R⁵ and R⁶ are as defined above and hal is a halogen. Using this reaction it is possible to go directly to the corresponding compounds of formula I without isolating the intermediates of formula II. In a preferred process for preparing the compounds of formula I wherein B B¹ has formula Ia the compounds of formula II wherein m is 0 are preapred and cyclised without isolation in a single step process by reacting an appropriate 2 mercaptobenzimidazole of formula wherein R¹, R², R³ and R⁴ are as defined above with a compound of formula wherein R, R⁵ R⁶ and n are as hereinbefore defined, the X groups being the same or different halogens. This reaction is conveniently carried out by heating in a suitable solvent, e.g. dimethylformamide, if desired in the presence of base. When n is O, and X is bromine then it is possible to isolate from such a reaction a corresponding compound of formula I wherein B B¹ is CHR⁵ It should be noted that due to tautomerism certain ring substituted 2 mercaptobenzimidazole starting materials are mixtures and hence mixtures of final products are obtained. For example 2 mercapto 5 methylbenzimidazole is tautomeric with 2 mercapto 6 methylbenzimidazole and the final product will be a mixture of compounds where R² or R³ is methyl. A further process for preparing the compounds of formula I wherein m is 0 comprises cyclising a compound of formula wherein B B¹ , n, R, R¹, R², R³, R⁴, R⁵ and R⁶ are as hereinbefore defined and one of A and B² is SH, the other is a leaving group providing that when A is SH then B² may also represent OH. When A or B² is a leaving group the cyclisation is generally carried out by heating if desired in the presence of base, e.g. triethylamine, K₂CO₃, NaOH,etc. When B² is OH t he cyclisation may be carried out in the presence of a strong acid, e.g. HCl or polyphosphoric acid. Compounds of formula VI wherein A is SH and B² is OH may be prepared by Compounds of formula VIII wherein B B¹ is CHR⁵ Compounds of formula VI wherein A is SH and B² is a leaving group and B B¹ has formula Ia or Ib may be prepared from the corresponding compounds of formula VI wherein B² is OH by known methods e.g. halogenation, sulphonylation to convert OH to a leaving group. Compounds of formula VI wherein A is a leaving group such as halogen and B² is SH may be prepared by building up the molecule from appropriate starting materials wherein the SH is protected by a thiol protecting group and removing the protecting group as the final step. Compounds of formula I wherein m is O, B B¹ has formula Ia and either n is 1 and R⁵ is hydrogen or n is 0 and R⁶ is hydrogen may also be prepared by a process which comprises reducing a compound of formula wherein R, R¹, R², R³, R⁴ and R⁶ are as hereinbefore defined and p is 0 or 1 with the proviso that when p is 1, R is heteroaryl. This reduction may be carried out using a metal hydride, e.g. lithium aluminium hydride. The compounds of formula IX may be prepared by cyclising a corresponding compound of formula X wherein p, R, R¹, R², R³, R⁴ and R⁶ are as defined above. Compounds of formula X may be prepared by reacting the appropriate 2 mercaptobenzimidazole with a haloacid of formula RCHBr CHR⁶ In yet a further process the compounds of formula I wherein m is 0 may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula wherein B B¹ , hal, n, R, R¹, R², R³, R⁴, R⁵ and R⁶ are as hereinbefore defined with Yet a further process for preparing compounds of formula I wherein B B¹ is CHR⁵ wherein R, R¹, R², R³, R⁴, R⁵, R⁶ and n are as hereinbefore defined. The cyclisation may be conveniently carried out under condensation conditions such as treatment with mixed base acid systems, e.g. sodium formate formic acetic anhydride or sodium acetate acetic anhydride, or by treatment with base followed by subsequent dehydration under acid conditions. Compounds of formula I wherein m is 0 and 1 may be interconverted. For example when m is 0 the compounds may be oxidised to the corresponding oxides of formula I wherein m is 1 by treatment with suitable oxidising agents e.g. hdyrogen peroxide, sodium periodate, peroxy acids such as peroxybenzoic acids and peroxyalkanoic acids. When m is 1 the compound of formula I may be reduced to the corresponding compound where m is 0 using a reducing agent such as a metal or boron hydride, e.g. BHCl₂. Compounds of formula I in which B B¹ does not contain a double bond may be oxidised to compounds of formula I in which a double bond is present and vice versa by reduction. Accordingly compounds of formula I are intermediates for other compounds of formula I. The compounds of formula I possess one or more asymmetric centres and hence optical isomers and mixtures thereof are possible. All such isomers and mixtures thereof are included within the scope of this invention. Where any reaction process produces mixtures of such isomers standard resolution techniques may be applied to separate a specific isomer. In any of the aforementioned reactions compounds of formula I may be isolated in free base form or as acid addition salts as desired. Quaternary ammonium salts may be prepared by reaction with an appropriate halide. Processes as described hereinabove which prepare novel compounds of formula I are within the scope of this invention.
