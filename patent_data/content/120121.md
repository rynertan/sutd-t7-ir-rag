# HORIZONTAL PLATE FILTER WITH SELF ALIGNING PLATES

## Abstract
A liquid filtering apparatus comprises upper and lower platens 14, 12 and a plurality of intermediate plate members 16 between the platens. When pressed together with a sheet of filter media between each pair of adjacent plates 16 , a fluid tight chamber for incoming liquid to be filtered is formed on one side of the filter media. When the filter media requires replacement, the upper platen 14 is lifted to separate the plates. Each plate is provided with combined alignment and stop means 20 so that when the plates are again brought together alter renewal of the filter media, they will automati cally resume their normal stacked position in proper align ment, the stop means also providing a pre selected amount of space between adjacent plates to cause a desired amount of compression for a sealing member between the plates. The alignment and stop means is designed to absorb the com pression load on the plates, thereby enabling them to be made of lighter metal or plastic materials without overstres sing their side walls.
