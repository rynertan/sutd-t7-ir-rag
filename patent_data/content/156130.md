## Description
PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF BLOWN FILM AND ORIENTED FILM The invention relates to a process for the preparation of blown film from a polymer composition on the basis of polyethylene, which polyethylene has a density of 910 to 940 kg m3, in which the polymer composition is, in molten condition, forced via an extruder through an annular die and is made to balloon out by means of a gas, supplied through an opening within the annular die, following which the polymer composition that has formed the balloon is cooled, flattened and rolled up. Such a process for the preparation of blown film is wellknown in itself and is described in, for instance, PetrothenePolyolefins ....... a processing guide a publication of the NationalDistillers and Chemical Corporation, 1971, 4th ed. . Low density polyethylene LDPE blown film has found largescale application as packaging material. The main requirements to be met by packaging material concern mechanical properties, such as stiffness, tear resistance, tensile strength, puncture resistance, and the like. Depending on the application, said material must often also satisfy requirements in the field of optical properties such as transparency, opacity and gloss. Film to be processed into refuse bags, for instance, will need to have a good puncture resistance and tear properties, while film for carrier bags must in addition have high stiffness. In applications such as bread packaging, it is especially stiffness and opticals that play a part. From Petrothene Polyolefins ....... a processing guide it is known that the best optical properties are obtained when the polymer melt is processed at the highest possible temperatures. A melt temperature of 205 cc is not exceptional. One of the factors affecting the mechanical properties is the degree of orientation of the melt. A recent development in the field of blown film preparation from low density polyethylene is the so called long stalk extrusion.This process, described in Plastics World of June 1982, pp. 62 64, starts from LDPE with a low melt index, which is processed at a temperature of 190 C with an extra high frost line. The frost line is the place on the balloon Where the polymer melt solidifies. The main difference between this long stalk extrusion and conventional extrusion lies in the degree of orientation of the melt. This results in blown film prepared by the long stalk process having a better impact strength than conventional blown film. A drawback is that the stiffness and the tear resistance, especially in machine direction, deteriorate substantially. In addition, it is not possible to convert linear low density polyethylene into film this way. The object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of blown film from a polymer composition on the basis of polyethylene with a density of 910 940 kg m3 that is suitable for both linear and non linear LDPE and that yields a film having good mechanical properties, notably high stiffness and good tear properties. This object is achieved by processing the molten polymer composition at a melt temperature at the location of the die gap of below 135 0C. Surprisingly, when processing is carried out under conditions according to the invention, special orientation effects occur, as a result of which good mechanical properties are imparted to the film, such as good tear resistance, tensile strength, high stiffness, etc.This effect increases when the temperature of the melt at the location of the die gap is below 130 C, so that processing at below 130 OC is to be preferred, and in particular at below 125 CC. The invention also relates to such oriented films. The degree and direction of orientation of a film can be determined by X ray diffraction. This method yields information on the orientation of the crystalline fraction of the film. In non oriented film the X rays are scattered equally in all directions, resulting in annular bands without fluctuations in intensity. This is represented schematically in Figure 1A, while Figure lii is a photograph of non oriented polyethylene. In oriented polyethylene the scattering intensity is direction dependent, so that there are fluctuations in intensity. In polyethylene, the intensity is largest at a diffraction angle of the Xray beam 20 of ca. 210 110 reflection of rhombic PE .The intensity fluctuations of this band are characteristic of the crystallite orientation and thus of the orientation of the crystallized molecules. The molecule direction is perpendicular to the associated intensity maximum. The average direction of orientation is characterized by the angle a which is the angle between the average orientation direction of the polymer molecules and the film extrusion direction Fig. 2A . The more the average molecule direction and the direction o extrusion coincide, the nearer a will approach 0 Fig. 2B . The distribution of the molecule direction degree of orientation manifests itself in the extensiveness of the intensity maximum. So the ratio intensity maximum intensity minimum is an index of the degree of orientation. Fig. 3 is a diagram of an X ray photograph. X is the direction of the X ray beam, 20 is the diffraction angle of the X ray beam, M is the direction of film extrusion machine direction , a is the angle between the average direction of orientation of the polymer molecules and the direction of film extrusion. It has now been found that films that have, when subjected toX ray diffraction analusis, an intensity ratio max. of the 110 reflec min.tion band of at least 20 and an angle a between the average orientation direction of the polymer molecules and the film extrusion direction of at most 200, have special mechanical properties, such as good tear reslstance, tensile strength, high stiffness, ett. Especially films with an intensitu ratio max. 30 and an angle a 15 , and in oparticular min. a 10 , possess these properties to a high degree. A degree of orientation thus high has not previously been found in known films on the basis of low density polyethylene. Polymer compositions that are suitable for being processed into blown film in accordance with the invention generally contain at least 50 x polyethylene homo and or copolymer with a density of 910 940 kg m3. Low density polyethylene homopolymer, copolymers of ethylene with one or more C3 C15 alkenes, copolymers of ethylene and one or more polar comonomers with a comonomer content of at most 10 wt. X, relative to the ethylene e.g. vinylacetate, methacrylate can be applied with good results. Also mixtures are suitable, like for instance mixtures of polyethylene homc and or copolymers with a density of 910 940 kg X3, or mixtures of polyethylene holo andfor copolymers having a density of 910 940 kg u3 with low density polyethylene copolymers with a density less than 940 kg w3 , high density polyethylene with a density in excess of 940 keg 33 and or polypropylene. In these mixtures preferably at least 70 wt. X, relative to the total polymer content, of the homoand or copolymer with a density of 910 940 kg m3 is present. For the preparation of films having good optical properties, the use of a polymer composition on the basis of polyethylene homopo loner or a copolymer of ethylene and one or more polar comonomers with a comonomer content of at most 10 vt. X relative to the ethylene, is to be recommended. The e process according to the invention is particularly suitable for the preparation of films having good mechanical and optical properties from low density polyethylene homopolymer or ethylene vinylacetate copolymer. Furthermore, various additives, such as stabilisers, slip agents, fillers, colourants, waxes and the like, may be present. The amount by weight of additives usually will not exceed 20 X of the amount by weight of polymer. The melt index of these polymer compositions, determined according to ASTM D 1238, may have the usual values, for instance between 0.3 and 30 dg min. In view of the low processing temperature, however, it is to be recommended to choose a melt index of not lower than 2 dg min. The favourable effect that low temperature processing has on the mechanical properties, decreases when the melt index exceeds 25 dglmin, and is most pronounced at a melt index of at most 20 dg ain, in particular at most 17 dg min. The advantage of the invention is that also polymer compositions having a relatively high melt index can be processed into blown film with good mechanical properties. Often, packaging film must not only satisfy requirements with respect to its mechanical properties, but also requirements relating to its optical properties. The optical properties of the film improve when use is made of a polymer composition having a melt index of at least 5 dg min, in particular at least 8 dg win. Blown film is obtained by forcing a polymer melt through an annular die, following which it is made to balloon out. In processingLDPE into blown film, the die gap usually is 0.4 to 0.9 mm, and this is also suitable for the process according to the invention. Larger die gaps, for instance of 5 or 10 mm, can also be applied in addition, the geometry of the die may be varied. It has now been found that the mechanical properties of the film improve when the die gap used is at least 2 mm and at most 5 mm, in particular at least 3 mm. In combination with the low processing temperature, these larger die gaps result in even better mechanical properties, notably in good stiffness and tear properties, while the optical properties are also improved. In blown film extrusion, the polymer composition exits the annular die in molten condition and is subsequently blown up. The resulting balloon is cooled by contacting it with relatively cool air or water. Balloon diameter divided by annular die diameter is called the blow up ratio. This may vary between 1 and 6, but generally is 1.5 to 4.These values can also be applied in the process according to the invention, yielding good results. The process according to the invention is suitable especially for the preparation of monolayer film, but can also be used for multilayer film. The invention will now be elucidated on the basis of some examples.Examples and comparative examples 1 through 15Blown film was prepared under conditions as shown in the table. Use was made of a Schwabethan extrusion equipment with a screw diameter of 30 mm and a length diameter ratio of 24 1. The diameter of the annular die was 5 cm. The melt temperature at the die gap was determined by infrared measurement. The film output was50 g min. Of the film, the following properties were determined modulus of elasticity according to ASTM D 1922 yield strength and tensile strength according to ISO R 527 puncture resistance, determined from the energy required to puncture the film with a plunger at a rate of 50 nia min notched tear resistance according to a method derived from bIN 53363, but with the notch at the centre of the film, at a drawing rate of 2.5 cm min gloss according to ASTM D 523 opacity according to ASTM D 1003 transparency according to the Electro Evans Ltd. method. The X ray diffraction measurement was performed usingCuKa radiation 50 iV, 35 mA, Ni filter and a Statton camera. Parallel film radiation was employed see Fig. 3 . The sample photograph distance was 5 cm. Densitometry of the photograph was carried out along the diameters of the circular bands for the directions N and a. For one den sitometer scan the changes in the intensity are recorded as a function of the diffraction angle of the X ray beam 20, Fig. 4 . For den sitometrical purposes use was made of an Enraf Nonius microdensitômeter, model 1, and the method described in C.G. Vonk A.P. Pijpers, J. Appl. Cryst., 14, 8, 1981 . The correction for the amorphous background radiation is carried out as indicated in Figure 4, taking into account the characteristic shape of the scattering curve for amorphous PE. The shaded part of Figure 4 represents the crystalline fraction of the 110 reflection band.Notes 1. not measured.2. the notch did not tear further, so that drawing phenomena occurred.3. owing to the high opacity, the value for transparency cannot be determined in a reliable way.4. a can only be determined in a reliable way if the intensity ratio max. sz 10. min.5.
