# A method of producing an airtight and waterproof slide fastener.

## Abstract
A method of producing a slide fastener wherein a series of fastener elements 3 are secured to each of a pair of fastener tapes 1 along one edge thereof, each said fastener tape is formed thereon with a waterproof sealing layer, and when said series of fastener elements on each said pair of fastener tapes are engaged with each other, the edges of said waterproof sealing layers on each said pair of fastener tapes are press contacted with each other so as to provide airtight ness and waterproofness. The improvement comprises form ing said pair of fastener tapes in one piece with a thin connecting portion therebetween, securing a pair of said se ries of fastener elements 3 to one side of said pair of fastener tapes 1 formed in one piece on the edges along both sides of said connecting portion so that they face each other with out being engaged with each other, applying a resiliently deformable waterproof sealing layer 4 all over the other side of said pair of fastener tapes formed in one piece in cluding said connecting portion, then cutting said pair of fastener tapes formed in one piece away from each other longitudinally along said connecting portion so that each cut edge of said waterproof sealing layer projects over a line which will become the center line of engagement of said pair of series of fastener elements when they are engaged with each other. The above method according to the invention produces an airtight and waterproof slide fastener in a simplified man ner without inpairing the engaging function of the slide fas tener and without rendering any damage to the fastener elements.
