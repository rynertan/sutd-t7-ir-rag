# Process for processing moist compositions containing pollution causing substances and composition.

## Abstract
A moist sludge as obtained from gases evolved during steel preparation in converters by blowing oxygen through said liquid steel, is treated with 30 flue dust. Preferably the mixing is effected in two steps in the first step 60 of the flue dust is added and the particles as obtained are mixed with the remaining flue dust in a second step without crushing the particles of the first step, particularly by using a whirling process.
