# Process for remelting polyamides.

## Abstract
In a process for the production of a shaped article involving the remelting of a polyamide which has been subjected to a drying stage, such as that which occurs during solid phase polymerisation, the stage of conditioning the polyamide prior to remelting can be reduced or avoided by adding a controlled amount of water to the molten polymer or immediately prior to its remelting.
