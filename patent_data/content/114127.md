# PLASTIC CLOSURE WITH SEALING FLAPS

## Abstract
This relates to a plastic material closure which is provided with deformable sealing flaps and co operating abutments wherein when the closure is drawn down onto a container, the flaps will deform in accordance with the cross section of the sealing surface area of the container including down inside of the mouth of the container and down along side the exterior surface of the neck finish to provide effective sealing contact with the container sealing area. Separate seals between the flaps and the container neck finish permit the same closure to be used to form gas tight seals both with respect to high internal pressures and vacuum packs. The seals are liquid tight and the closure may be used for reclos ing the container against liquid loss.
