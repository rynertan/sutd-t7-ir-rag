Detailed Description The compounds of the invention are prepared from known precursors as outlined in the following flow chart and the details of their preparation are disclosed in Examples 1 6, below. Preparation of the other compounds on the flow chart are described in the literature and summarized below. Flow ChartEMI4.1 The starting materials for the process of the invention are nitroaniline and substituted nitroanilines.These compounds are themselves known to the art or may be prepared from known compounds by methods which are well known to the art, for example, by the nitration of a suitably substituted aniline derivative or selective reduction of the desired dinitroaniline derivative. The reaction of step 1 of the flow chart is carried out utilizing a solution of the appropriate primary arylamine and a suitable acid acceptor such as triethylamine, dimethylaniline, pyridine, and the like in an inert organic solvent. However, an acid acceptor is not always necessary, and an excess of the primary arylamine may also serve as acid acceptor. Among the suitable solvents are l,2 dimethoxyethane, benzene, chloroform, dichloromethane, dimethylacetamide, dimethylformamide, and the like. Alternatively an excess of the primary arylamine or the acid acceptor may serve as a solvent, or the reaction may be carried out in the absence of solvent. Generally, an equimolar quantity of the appropriate perfluoroalkane sulfonic anhydride or halide is added to the solution.The addition is advantageously carried out at 15 C to 500C, and for some reactants higher or lower temperatures may be preferable.In cases where the amine is of lower reactivity, it is advantagous to allow the reaction mixture to remain at reflux temperature for a few hours following addition. The reaction of step 1 may also be carried out in a high pressure reactor. This technique is particularly preferred when perfluoroalkanesulfonyl fluorides are used as reactants. These reactions are usually carried out at temperature ranges of 0 to 1500C, but these temperature ranges may be raised or lowered, depending upon the reactants used. Such reactions are most frequently carried out without solvent, or with dimethylformamide or excess triethylamine as solvent, but other advantageous variations are possible. After completion of the reaction, the product is isolated by conventional methods. For example, the reaction mixture can be extracted with excess aqueous sodium hydroxide. The aqueous extract is then washed with organic solvents and treated with charcoal to remove impurities. Subsequent acidification of the aqueous extract with mineral acid then affords the product as an oil or solid which is distilled, sublimed, chromatographed, or recrystallized as required to give pure product. When water soluble solvents are used, the reaction mixture can be poured directly into aqueous mineral acids. The product is then isolated by conventional extraction techniques and purified as above. Step 2 is a reduction of the nitro group of the intermediate perfluoroalkylsulfonanilide. Chemical or catalytic methods well known to the art are successful.Raney nickel is a suitable catalyst for the reduction and the product is isolated by conventional methods. Step 3 of the flow chart is carried out by reacting the desired aminoperfluoroalkylsulfonanilide derivative with a slight excess of a compound of the formula R2CQ, wherein Q is halogen, preferably 0 chlorine, or an anhydride residue. The reaction may be carried out in suitable non reactive solvents such as amides of organic acids e.g., N,N dimethylformamide , ethers e.g., tetrahydrofuran , chlorinated hydrocarbons e.g., ethylenedichloride and the like. It can also be carried out in the absence of solvent. The reaction temperature may be from about OOC to 100 C, depending upon the rate of reaction desired. The reaction proceeds readily at room temperature about 250C . The product is isolated by conventional methods. The reaction of step 4 is carried out by reacting the product of step 3 with one equivalent of R3Q, wherein R3 is as defined for Compound T and Q is halogen, preferably iodine, bromine, or chlorine. The reaction may be carried out in a suitable non reactive solvent, preferably dimethoxyethane, in the presence of two equivalents of an insoluble acid acceptor such as sodium hydride. The reaction temperature is from about 200 to 800C, depending upon the rate of reaction desired. After completion of the reaction, the inorganic portion is separated by filtration. The filtrate is concentrated in a vacuum, and the product is purified by recrystallization. The reaction of step 5 is carried out by reacting the product of step 4 with R6Q, wherein R6 is as defined for Compound I and Q is halogen, preferably iodine, bromine, or chlorine. The reaction may be carried out in a suitable non reactive solvent, preferably acetone, in the presence of an insoluble acid acceptor such as anhydrous sodium carbonate. The reaction temperature may be from about 200 to 550C, depending upon the rate of the reaction desired. After completion of the reaction, the inorganic portion is separated by filtration. The filtrate is concentrated in a vacuum, and the product is purified by recrystallization. The reaction of step 6 is carried out by reacting the product of step 3 with R6Q using a procedure similar to that of step 5 . The salts of the invention are generally metal, ammonium, and organic amine salts and can be prepared by treating the acid form compound with an appropriate base under mild conditions. Among the metal salts of the invention are alkali metal e.g. lithium, sodium and potassium , alkaline earth metal e.g. barium, calcium, and magnesium and heavy metal e.g. zinc and iron salts as well as other metal salts such as aluminum. Appropriate bases for use in preparing the metal salts incll e metal oxides, hydroxides, carbonates, bicarbo, tes, and alkoxides. Some salts are also prepared by cation exchange reactions by reacting a salt of the invention with an organic or inorganic salt in a cation exchange reaction .The organic amine salts include the salts of aliphatic e.g. alkyl , aromatic, and heterocyclic amines, as well as those having a mixture of these types of structures. The amines useful in preparing the salts of the invention can be primary, secondary, or tertiary and preferably contain not more than 20 carbon atoms. Such amines include, for example, morpholine, methyl cyclohexylamine, glucosamine, amines derived from fatty acids, etc. The amine and ammonium salts can be prepared by reacting the acid form with the appropriate organic base or ammonium hydroxide. Any of the salts of the types set out above are agriculturally acceptable, the one chosen depending upon the particular use and upon the economics of the situation. Of particular utility are the akali metal, alkaline earth, ammonium, and amine salts. The salts of the invention are frequently formed by reacting the precursors in aqueous solution. This solution can be evaporated to obtain the salt of the compound, usually as a dry powder. In some cases, it may be more convenient to use a non aqueous solvent such as alcohols, acetone, etc. The resulting solution is then treated to remove the solvent, for example, by evaporation under reduced pressure. It will be appreciated that the scope of this invention encompasses starting materials of a wide range of physical and chemical properties, and the synthetic methods discussed herein are described in general and preferred language. However, a great variation in the use of these synthetic techniques is possible, and this invention is broadly inclusive of such variations. The herbicidal activity of the compounds of the invention has been determined using screening tests against greenhouse plantings. Both pre and post emergence activity are determined in a direct screen against selected weed species. The following are examples of weeds which are used for these tests. Grasses Giant Foxtail Setaria Faberii Barnyard grass Echinochloa crusgalli Crabgrass Digitaria ischaemum Quackgrass Agopyron repens Yellow Nutsedge Cyperus esculentus Broad leaves Pigweed Amaranthus retroflexus Purslane Portulaca oleracea Wild Mustard Brassica kaber Wild Morning Glory Convolvulus arvensis The test chemicals were dissolved in a small amount of acetone or other suitable solvent and then diluted with water to give a concentration of 2000 ppm.From this concentration aliquots were diluted to give a final concentration of 500 ppm. Eighty ml. of this solution were added to a 6 inch pot 15 cm containing the weed seeds to give a concentration equivalent to 20 lb acre 9.0 kg hectare . Use of 20 ml. of said solution gave a concentration equal to 5 lb acre 2.25 kg hectare .All subsequent waterings are made from the bottom. Two pots are used per treatment. Data were taken 2 to 3 weeks after treatment and recorded as percent pre emergence kill for each species compared to the untreated controls. To assess post emergence activity, the same weed mixtures were allowed to grow from two to three weeks until the grasses were approximately 1 to 3 inches 2.5 to 7.6 cm and the broadleaves 1 to 1 1 2 inches 2.5 to 3.8 cm tall. They were sprayed for approximately 10 seconds or until good wetting of the leaf surfaces occurred with a 2000 ppm solution as described above. Data were taken two to three weeks after treatment and recorded as percent kill for each species compared to the untreated controls. The compounds of this invention are broadly active as herbicides and show various types of plant growth modifying activity. Plant growth modification as defined herein consists of all deviations from natural development, for example, defoliation, stimulation, stunting, retardation, desiccation, tillering, dwarfing, regulation, and the like. This plant growth modifying activity is generally observed as the compounds of the invention begin to interfere with certain processes within the plant. If these processes are essential, the plant will die if treated with a sufficient dose of the compound. However, the type of growth modifying activity observed varies among types of plants. The compounds of the invention have been found to be particularly effective in controlling established rhizomatous Johnsongrass Sorghum halepense L. Pers. .The control of rhizomatous Johnsongrass is especially important since it is not ordinarily controlled effectively at an application rate that is tolerant to crops by commercially available herbicides although seedling Johnsongrass is susceptible to several commercial herbicides . For application to plants, the compounds can be finely divided and suspended in any of the usual aqueous media. In addition, spreading agents, wetting agents, sticking agents, or other adjuvants can be added as desired. Dry powders, as such, or diluted with inert materials such as diatomaceous earth, can likewise be used as dusts for this purpose. The preparations are coated on the plants or the ground is covered with them when preemergence control is desired. Application is made with the usual sprayers, dust guns and the like. Application rates are at 0.5 to 20 lbs acre 0.23 to 9.0 kg hectare in general, but may be increased or reduced according to individual circumstances of use. Since certain compounds of the invention are par ticularly active against Johnsongrass, it i. livantageous to combine them with other known . .bLcide . c en or maximize the weed spectrum controlled by herbicidal co S o sitions of this invention or to better control a weed not well controlled by specific compounds of the invention. Furthermore, herbicidal composition containing compounds of the invention may contain, in addition, nematicides, fungicides, insecticides, fertilizers, trace metals, soil conditioners, other plant growth regulators, and the like.Such combinations are clearly envisioned in this invention. The following examples are given for the purpose of further illustrating the present invention but are not intended, in any way, to be limiting of the scope thereof.All parts are given by weight unless otherwise specifically noted. The individual infrared spectra coincide with the assigned structure. Example 1Preparation of 2,4 dimethyl 5 nitrotrifluoromethanesulfonanilide according to step 1 .
