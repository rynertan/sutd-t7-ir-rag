# Device to feed a multiple feed straightening machine automatically downstream of a cooling plate.

## Abstract
Procedure to feed sections 35 automatically to a straightening machine 16 located downstream of a cooling plate 11 , such procedure comprising the following steps withdrawal of several sections 35 , one at a time, from the cooling plate 11 together with formation of a layer of sections which comprises the sections already in their feed positioning, transfer of the thus obtained layer of sections to the straightening machine 16 , and controlled feed of the sections 35 , the withdrawal of each single section 35 from the cool ing plate 11 taking place by the lateral movement and de positing of such section 35 on a layer forming support 19 advancing step by step in the direction of such lateral movement so as to form a layer, such layer thus formed be ing then aligned with the straightening machine 16 . Device 10 for the automatic feed of sections 35 to a straightening machine 16 located downstream of a cooling plate 11 , such device comprising a unit 12 to form layers which lies on the same axis as, and immediately downstream of, the cooling plate, a transfer unit 13 , a feeder unit 14 , and a lead in unit 15 .
