## Description
SUPPORT STRUCTURE FOR USE IN WATER The present invention relates to a support structure for use in liquid and in particular to a support structure formed essentially by freezing the liquid. In a more preferred form the invention relates to a structure for use in water to provide for example, an off shore drilling platform, temporary bridge structure, floating work platform or recreation platform. The structure may be a floating structure which is partly or fully submerged or may be adapted to bear on the floor of the sea, river, lake or the like in a partly or fully submerged condition.The structure may also be used to repair fractures or holes occurring in vessels or containers in liquid by freezing the liquid in the vicinity of the hole. For example, a hole in the hull of a ship or in a dam may be repaired using a structure according to the invention. The invention also provides a method of constructing a support structure of the aforementioned kind. Conventionally off shore drilling or mining structures are intricate platform structures formed from metal and or concrete. The considerable depths of water sometimes encountered at prospective drilling or mining sites prohibits the use of such conventional structures on mechanical and or economical grounds. In any case the cost of building the conventional structures is very high and maintenance costs are also very high due to a number of factors including primarily, corrosion. The high initial costs stem from the fact that most of the fabrication occurs on shore due to the intricate work involved and the finished or partly finished structure is towed to the site. The towing process is energy intensive and expensive and involves a complex launching operation prior to towing and a complex anchoring process after towing, further adding significantly to the cost involved. Accordingly it is one object of this invention to provide a support structure adapted to overcome or at least reduce one or more of the aforementioned problems of offshore drilling structures as well as providing a support structure which may be adapted to many other uses. It is another object of the invention to provide an improved method of constructing a support structure in water. Thus the invention provides a support structure for use in liquid comprising a pipe arrangement adapted for location in said liquid, means for circulating coolant or refrigerant through said pipe arrangement causing said liquid to freeze in the vicinity of said pipe arrangement to form and maintain a frozen liquid support structure substantially in the form of a solid block around said pipe arrangement. In another form the invention provides a method of constructing a support structure in liquid, characterized in that said method includes the steps of forming an arrangement of pipes into a matrix, and passing coolant or refrigerant through said, pipes to cause said liquid to freeze in the vicinity of said matrix so as to form and maintain a frozen liquid support structure substantially in the form of a solid block around said pipe arrangement. In order that the invention may be more readily understood particular embodiments will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein Fig. 1 is a schematic plan view of a pipe system for a support structure according to one embodi ment of the invention, Fig. 2 is a schematic side elevation of a support structure incorporating the system of Fig. 1, Fig. 3 is a schematic plan view of a pipe system according to an alternative embodiment of the invention. Fig. 4 is a section on the line 4 4 of Fig. 3, and Fig. 5 is a schematic side elevation of a modified form of the previous Figs. with the pipe system omitted. A support structure according to the invention is constructed by firstly forming a pipe system in the form of a grid or matrix 10 as shown in Fig. 1. The grid or matrix 10 of Fig. 1 is a two dimensional planar grid and has an inlet pipe 11 and an outlet pipe 12 for supplying refrigerant to the grid by means not shown . The grid 10 may be formed in modules which are joined together on site enabling the grid to be readily constructed. Alternatively the grid 10 may be formed on shore and towed to the particular site although this alternative is not preferred particularly when a large structure is to be formed.The modules which go together to form the grid may be joined by screw joints which are simpler, easier and cheaper than welding although welding may be used. Any small initial leaks of refrigerant through the joints will be sealed when ice builds up around the pipes as will become apparent hereinbelow. The grid is not necessarily square or rectangular but may be curved or otherwise shaped according to the particular application. The modules forming. the grid 10 may be towed by ship or transported by ship to the site and joined together in the water. It is necessary to attach some means of flotation to the pipes during the initial joining operation and until an ice formation occurs in order to prevent the grid from sinking. According to an alternative form of the invention the grid may be allowed to sink partly or fully to the bottom in order that the ice may be formed at a cooler temperature away from solar heat and prevailing winds which tend to melt the ice. As the ice is formed the structure will tend to float towards the surface and such flotation may be controlled by suitable weighing to the structure, or by adjusting the degree of refrigerant. The inlet pipe 11 and the outlet pipe 12 are suitably connected to a ship or barge which has suitable apparatus for pumping the refrigerant through the pipe grid. Various refrigerants may be used and it is presently envisaged that liquid nitrogen would be a most suitable refrigerant for the purposes of this invention. The pipes may be made of metal or a suitable plastics material and the spacing between the pipework forming the grid 10 will depend on the diameter of the pipe, the material from which it is formed and various other factors including the temperature of the water in which the structure is to be formed. For most applications the spacing must be such that an ice formation may be formed around the grid l0 in a solid block, but this may not always be the case as the formation need not be continuous between adjacent pipes in some applications. Fig. 2 shows a support structure 13 of ice formed around the grid 10 of Fig. 1. The structure 13 provides a working platform which may be used for any number of different purposes such as, for example, mining of underwater petroleum, mineral or sea life resources or a temporary bridge structure. Fig. 3 shows an alternative embodiment of the invention where the grid structure 10 is a three dimensional grid structure. In other words instead of being a planar grid structure which is arranged parallel to the surface of the water the grid extends downwardly to produce a more substantial block of ice. The principle of operation is the same as with the grid of Fig. 1 in that refrigerant is pumped in an inlet pipe lla and is conducted through all the pipes of the grid to the outlet pipe 12a. The support structure formed according to the embodiment of Fig. 3 is far more massive than the structure of the previous embodi ment and thus is far more stable in the water. Whilst generally the structure would be a floating structure it is conceivable that in some instances the structure could be arranged on the bed or floor of the river, lake or the like wherein the structure is formed. Fig. 4 shows a sectional sideviewofXthepipe5ridaccording to the structure of Fig. 3. It will be noted that the pipes may be bound together by suitable tape, wire or other binding material 14 at the points of intersection of the pipe grid. Other means such as welding or screwing could be used. Fig. 5 shows a modification of the support structure of Fig. 3 wherein a hole is provided completely through the ice structure from top to bottom in order to enable drill rods and the like to be extended through the struc ture for drilling into the floor of the ocean or other exapanse of water wherein the structure is situated. The hole 15 may be cut through the ice after formation of the structure or may be defined in the pipe array in a manner whereby the hole is formed during the initial freezing process. In addition the structure of Fig. 5 provides a number of cavities 16 in the underside of the ice block and the cavities may be used for a number of purposes. As with the hole 15 the cavities may be formed by suitably shaping the pipe array to cause the cavities to form during the initial ice forming process.The cavities may be formed to have a thermal insulation layer 17 in cases where fluid having a temperature greater than the temperature of the ice is to be stored. A vent pipe 18 with valve not shown extends from the top surface of the structure into each cavity 16 for the purpose of providing access to the cavity from above. When the structure is used as a drilling platform, for example, for oil, liquid or gaseous petroleum products, or any other gases the cavities 16 may be used as a temporary or permanent storage facility. Alternatively, in order to raise the level of the structure in the water the cavities may be filled with air or pressurized gas or liquid through the vent pipes 18 causugthe level of the structure to be raised by increasing its buoyancy.In a further embodiment not shown the block may be formed with one or more internal chambers with suitable access channels by forming the pipe array into the desired shape. Such chambers and access channels passages may be used for accommodation and movement of personnel or for storage of equipment, for example. It should be appreciated that the support structure of the present invention has many advantages over conventional off shore platforms or support structures. For example, construction is carried out at the site of interest using the readily available natural environment water which is frozen to provide the structure. Furthermore, because the structure has its bulk below water level it is more massive than webbed metal structures which are more plonk to damage by wave forces. As a result the ice platform is easie to stabilize in position. Of course there are many other advantages of the structure according to this invention as will be readily apparent to persons skilled in the art. For instance the floating structure is relatively free from seismic disturbances compared with known structures.The presence of the ice platform in a warmer atmosphere and surrounding water means that a large temperature differential exists between the ice platform and its surrounding environment. Energy is consumed in the process of establishing and maintaining the structure by refrigeration of the water to ice but some of this energy may be recycled by the use of heat pipes or ocean thermal energy conversion units OTEC . With one end embedded in the ice platform or situated in the cold water layer adjacent to the ice structure and the other in the surrounding warmer water or atmosphere, energy may be generated by OTEC turbines to be used for processes, assistance to refrigeration system, or a power system to dynamically position the ice platform above a sea bed position.Also because of the cold water stream continually pouring down from below the ice platform particularly in tropical waters, OTEC units which may only need to be meters in length could possibly generate as much energy as conventional units up to a kilometer in length. Because the platform in its surrounding melt region is at or close 0 to a temperature of 0 C, greater thermal differentials may be tapped than in most natural situations. Of course the inherently simpler method of construction of the ice platform would make it more cost effective compared with traditional off shore mining units. Thus under sea, petroleum or mineral deposits currently too small to economically mine, may prove economically attractive ventures with the aid of the present invention. As mentioned above the ice structure may be arranged to float on or at the surface of the water or may be suspended at an intermediate depth in the water or may be attached to the bottom surface beneath the water. A submerged structure could sink to a required depth by adjusting the refrigeration system to vary the thickness of ice build up, that is, vary the degree of flotation of the structure. As mentioned above the cavities 16 provide another excellent means for buoyancy control, for instance, using gas vented from the refrigeration system. The portability of the structure provides an escape advantage in an emergency such as blowout in an oil or gas well, and facilitates structural removal operations when mining ceases. The structure may be used as an emergency rescue craft for surface use or for the raising of sunken craft. The structure may be formed around a vertical planar grid to form a dam or the like. Also the platform may be adapted to provide a fishing craft, mooring buoys and many other useful structures. According to a still further embodiment of the invention the support structure according to the invention may be used to repair fractures or holes occurring in the hulls of ships or in dams or the like merely by arranging the pipe arrangement in the vicinity of the damaged area and circulating the coolant therethrough until a frozen structure is formed to block the hole or cover the fracture. Whilst the invention has been primarily described in relation to freezing of water it is readily conceivable that it could be utilized in other liquids. In all the above described embodiments the refrigerated support structure provides for solid material to be formedin intimabecontact with the outside surface of the pipe arrangement, thus providing a barrier against access of oxygen or other corrosive elements, that is, the buildup of frozen liquid acts as a corrosion resistant barrier layer. In order to prevent thermal losses from the structure during the initial freezing process and thereafter a sheet of impermeable material such as a plastic sheet material or a semi permeable fabric such as a cloth may be wrapped around the matrix. The material acts as a containment material to maintain, in the vicinity of the pipes the liquid that is to be frozen and also reduces the thermal losses of the structure once it is frozen. A material such as sail cloth would be suitable and would facilitate handling in conditions of strong wind. Furthermore, in a modification of the structures described the pipe system may comprise a planar top grid or matrix as shown in Fig. 1 and downwardly depending sides in the form of planar matrixes which may extend vertically or be inclined inwardly or outwardly. In other words the central portion of the block is hollow and does not have pipes therein. There may or may not be a planar bottom pipe matrix. The liquid is trapped within the side walls as they freeze and ultimately the central portion becomes frozen.
