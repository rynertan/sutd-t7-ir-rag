# AN INFUSION APPARATUS

## Abstract
An infusion pump pressure monitor comprises means 26, 27, 30, 31 to drive an infusion pump, a pressure sensor 38 to monitor the delivery pressure downstream of the pump, and a programmed computer 34, 35 programmed to monitor the maximum delivery pressure that occurs during an initial operating period, and then, subsequently to monitor the delivery pressure downstream of the pump for the remainder of the delivery period of the infusion pump. The programmed computer 34, 35 is programmed to disable the means 26, 27, 30, 31 to drive the infusion pump if the monitored delivery pressure differs by more than a predetermined amount from the maximum pressure moni tored during the initial operating period. The infusion liquid is carried by a disposable infusion set having a pressure responsive chamber 1 located in a key hole shaped slot 44 in the pressure monitor.
