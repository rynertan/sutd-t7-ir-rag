# Enhanced yeast transcription employing hybrid promoter region constructs.

## Abstract
Yeast promoters of glycolytic enzymes are modified by isolating a fragment encompassing the RNA polymerase binding site and joining to the 5 end of this fragment a DNA sequence providing for enhanced inducible or constitutive transcription of a structural gene. Constructs are prepared for efficient expression of foreign genes in yeast. Yeast strains 2150 2 3 pCI 1GAPSOD and AB110 pCI 1GAPATi9 , producing human α₁ antitrypsin and superoxide dismutase, were deposited at the A.T.C.C. on May 9, 1984 and given Accession Nos. 20708 and 20709, respectively and 2150 2 3 GAP5 , 2150 2 3 Pyk5 and 2150 2 3 PHO5GAP1 , expressing Hepatitis B surface antigen, were deposited at the A.T.C.C. on May 9, 1984 and given Accession Nos. 20705, 20706 and 20707, respectively.
