# Reclinable vehicle seats.

## Abstract
A reclinable seat for use in vehicles provides two systems enabling an occupant to adopt reclining postures. The seat comprises a bottom part and a back support part rotatable together about an axis in a support frame to be fixed in the vehicle. The axis is transverse to the seat and adjacent to the bottom part, enabling the seat to be rotated bodily about the axis into reclining positions. The back support part is pivoted to the bottom part so that it can be tilted separately into reclining positions. Separate control means are provided respectively for locating the seat in positions angularly spaced about the axis and for locating the back support part in angularly spaced positions relative to the bottom part. Limiting means are provided for limiting the permitted angle between the back support and the bottom part, the limiting means being influenced by rotation of the bottom part about the axis so as to reduce the permitted angle progressively as the bottom part is rotated rearwardly from its normal upright position.
