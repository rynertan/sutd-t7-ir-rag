# Process for continuous removal of ammoniacal nitrogen from aqueous streams.

## Abstract
A continuous process for removal of ammoniacal nitro gen from water is disclosed. This process is useful for main taining water quality in aquaculture operations, e.g., fish hatcheries and the like. A particulate stream of zeolitic ion exchange material is circulated continuously through an ex changer 13 and a regenerator 19 . An aqueous process stream 11 containing ammoniacal nitrogen, e.g., ammonia, is passed through the exchanger 13 in continuous counter current liquid solid contact with a stream of particulate, am moniacal nitrogen sorbing zeolitic ion exchange material of natural or synthetic origin. A treated liquid water stream 15 having a reduced ammoniacal nitrogen content exits from the exchanger 13 , as does a stream 17 of ammoniacal nitrogen enriched particulate zeolitic ion exchange material. The latter stream is regenerated in the regenerator 19 at a temperature of about 350 C. to about 650 C. while an oxygen containing gas stream 23 , e.g., air, is passed in continuous counter current gas solid contact therewith. Gases emanat ing from the regenerator 19 are used to preheat the am moniacal nitrogen enriched particulate material that enters the regenerator 19 . The regenerated stream 21 of partic ulate, ammoniacal nitrogen sorbing zeolitic ion exchange material is recycled to the exchanger 13 .
