## Description
The present invention relates to a process for the production of padding having a high degree of thermal insulation, and particularly to padding which is usable for clothing and furnishings, although it is to be understood that the padding of the invention is not limited to such use. In an earlier patent application by the same applicant Italian Patent application No 20978 A 84 filed 17 May, 1984 , the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, there is illustrated a process for the production of a padding suitable for use in clothing, furnishing or the like, which consists, substantially, in producing a layer of fibres, preferably of polyester or the like, mixed with silicone treated fibres of various natures, which upon carding is formed into a soft, light web which is subsequently surface treated on one face with a mixture of sticky plastics adhesives so as to form, after polymerisation, a very soft and elastic film on the other side of the layer, on the other hand, there is applied an adhesive of different nature, which is not sticky. The thus treated layer is then subjected to a calendering operation at variable temperature and pressures, in such a way as conveniently to reduce the initial thickness, and during this calendering operation, for a certain very short period of time, one of the cylinders of the calender remains in adhesive contact with the sticky surface on the said one face of the web, consequently creating an expansion which substantially forms air pockets within the interior of the padding. Padding formed in accordance with this earlier invention has thermal insulation characteristics which are a significant improvement over those encountered in conventional paddings of previously known type which, among other things, are generally rather thick and therefore do not lend themselves well to use in clothing moreover, such known padding materials do not have such good thermal insulation characteristics as can be achieved with the padding material of the applicant s earlier invention forming the subject of the patent application referred to above. The present invention seeks to provide a padding material, and a process for the production of same, which will have further and significantly improved thermal insulation characteristics, and will be more compact and manageable than hithertofore known padding materials. The present invention also seeks to provide a padding material which can be used more conveniently for clothing or furnishings than prior art padding materials which will have exceptional thermal insulation characteristics without however relinquishing the characteristics of softness, elasticity and pleasantness to the touch typical of padding materials generally. Finally, the present invention seeks to provide a process which leads to the production of a padding which, as well as having significantly improved characteristics, is more aesthetically pleasing than previously known paddings and which, moreover, is more easily workable than prior art padding materials. According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a process for the production of padding having a high degree of thermal insulation, usable for clothing and furnishing, comprising the steps of first producing a web comprising a layer obtained by carding a mixture of fibres of polyester or other fibres with silicone treated fibres of diverse nature and origin, resin coating the said web, on one face thereof, with a mixture of adhesives having a sticky plastic consistency, which, when polymerised, form a soft, elastic film, spraying onto the opposite face from said one face of said web a non sticky adhesive calendering the layer thus treated at a variable temperature, and subsequently applying to at least one face of said web a surface layer of metal particles embedded in a synthetic resin. According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided padding made by a process as defined hereinabove comprising a sheet like body constituted by a web of carded fibres surface treated with a mixture of plastics adhesives and calendered to create a reduction in thickness and an associated surface compaction, and at least one surface layer on said sheet like body composed of metal particles embedded in a synthetic resin. Various embodiments of the invention will now be more particularly described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which With reference to the various figures of the accompanying drawings, the process of the invention for the production of padding with a high degree of thermal insulation comprises the preliminary production of a layer or web 1 in accordacne with the teaching of the applicant s earlier patent application referred to hereinabove namely Italian patent application No 20978 A 84 , and then onto this web 1 there is applied a layer 2 of metal particles embedded in synthetic resin as shown in Figure 2. Simultaneously or subsequently a second layer of metal particles embedded in a synthetic resin may be applied to the opposite face of the web 1 as shown in Figure 3. More precisely, the or each said layer is constituted by an acrylic or polyurethane or vinyl resin, which may be in emulsion or in a solvent, pigmented with aluminium or any other metal powder, in such a way as to confer a metallised appearance to the surface of the product. If emulsions are used, these latter will be in aqueous phase, whilst if the said resins are in solution, the solvents used may be esters, ketones, dimethylformamides, aromatic hydrocarbons and the like. The said layer of resin and metallic powders may be applied on the web of padding by metallisation in a high vacuum, by either direct or transfer stamping, or by means of spreading or spraying, which may also be in direct form or by transfer techniques. Direct metallisation of a surface of the padding, however, presents not insiginificant practical and economic problems. Such a process, in fact, is substantially discontinuous and, moreover, the material wadding to be subjected to this process is very voluminous so that the length of the rolls of material which can be introduced into a conventional metallisation installation is necessarily limited and the full metallisation capacity of such an installation cannot be adequately utilised. An excessively low productivity is therefore experienced. More advantageously a transfer process involving the preliminary metallisation of a film of plastics material is envisaged. Preferably, a polyester film with a thickness in the region of 12 25 µm is used in such a process. For this process the film is preliminarily treated with a release medium such as an anti adhesive lacquer, and then the metal is applied to it by any known metallisation technique. The metal is then transferred to the web of wadding by means of a hot calendering operation using a calender operating, for example, at a speed of around 30 m min and at a temperature of 100 140⁰C and with a specific pressure of 10 30 mg cm². With a process such as that indicated above it is possible easily to obtain metallisation of different colours including silver, gold and bronze, with very important aesthetic effects from a commercial point of view. The application of a metallised layer by spreading or spraying onto a substrate is also a known technique. This comprises spreading or spraying an emulsion, or better since this allows aesthetically more pleasing results to be obtained a solution of resins in organic solvents in which metal pigments generally aluminium and organic colorants have been dispersed to impart a different coloration to the solution itself. The most suitable resins for this purpose for the particular application of metallising onto synthetic fibre wadding are, as already indicated, acrylic, vinyl and polyurethane resins. The following examples illustrate, purely by way of example, various typical solutions which may be formed by means of the said resins. In use it will of course be necessary to bring the solid content and the viscosity to values suited to the particular system of application. Whilst acrylic resins are more suitable for application by spray techniques, vinyl and polyurethane resins lend themselves greatly to application by spreading. Spray application can be effected using known techniques. After drying the material is calendered to improve the appearnace of the wadding at a temperature for example of 100 120 Application by spreading is considered more practical and more economically convenient, and in general spreading by so called transfer or offset techniques is preferred in that it permits more brilliant and technically more controllable and interesting results to be obtained. The technology for transfer or offset spreading is substantially known this involves the application, to a suitably devised release medium such as anti adhesive paper which may have a polished, semi polished, matt or embossed or other finish, a resin solution of a thickness considered most suitable generally in thicknesses of 100 200 µm using a roller doctor blade system. The spread layer of solution is brought into contact with a web of wadding and the whole assembly then passed into a drying furnace at 100 180 It is suitable at this point to make it clear that, whichever method of its application to the web of wadding the thickness of the layer can vary within wide limits in dependence on the final utilisation envisaged for the padding itself. Further, the metallisation operation can obviously be effected on any other type of padding for clothing and furnishing. The layer which is obtained on the surface of the web of wadding is, preferably, several microns thick and such as to form a surface film having significant elasticity in such a way as not to prejudice in any way the typical characteristics of softness and suppleness of the padding. The application of the said surface layer is physically of significant importance in that it substantially forms a barrier layer which is largely impermeable to air from the outside up to 80 but such as not to retain moisture vapour or cause condensation within the layer. The physical characteristics of the metallised layer are such that, when it is applied to the face which will be the outside of the padding that is on the opposite face from that nearest to the body in a case in which the padding is to be utilised for clothing it significantly reduces the transmission of heat by convection. The presence of an almost air impermeable layer, in fact, causes the creation within the layer of padding of a cushion or air pocket which remains almost static and which, consequently, constitutes a notable thermal barrier not allowing the dispersion of heat towards the outside The padding thus formed also has notable improvements as far as the transmission of heat by radiation is concerned in that the layer of metal particles, preferably of aluminium, but which may be of other substances forms in a sense, a heat reflective surface such that the heat within the padding layer is not transmitted by radiation to the outside, but reflected back towards the inside thus further increasing the insulating factor of the layer As far as the transmission of heat by conduction is concerned, the very small thickness of the metal particle containing layer is such as not to cause appreciable variations in the heat transmitted by conduction. The metallised layer which is formed on the surface of the wadding is suitably permeable to moisture so that possible condensation phenomena are avoided, which phenomena could result in the formation of condensation within the interior of the layer, which would be detrimental to the insulating properties of the padding in that the condensate would in practice fill cavities or zones which, otherwise,would be filled with air. The metallised layer, as well as being elastic and soft, thus permits any possible condensation or moisture which may form within the padding to escape therefrom thus contributing to an improvement in the health characteristics of the product. Another important aspect of the invention is constituted by the fact that the metallised surface layer, being composed of metal particles embedded in a synthetic resin, has the function of conferring a greater compactness and dimensional stability to the padding layer thus formed, making this latter thus more easily workable for example in the production of windcheater jackets and quilting in that any fraying which might otherwise occur in correspondence with the cut edges is significantly reduced. Because of this the said metallised surface layer is able to facilitate the washing operations on the finished product as well as exerting a definite locking action on the surface fibres allowing the padding to be used with any type of fabric, even very light fabric, without the possibility of hairs, down or fibres escaping therefrom. Moreover, the product obtained is very consistent, thus making it unnecessary to perform stitching through of the manufactured product, as was previously necessary in order to maintain the fabric and padding connected together. Further, the layers of padding thus formed can be joined together in such a way as to provide a composite padding as shown in Figures 6 and 7 comprising two or more layers, incorporating one or more thermal barriers within the thickness of the composite layer as well as one or more surface layer. The presence of the metallised surface layer contributes, moreover, to improving the appearance and presentation of the product in that it presents a brilliant surface aspect due to the presence of the metal particles in the resin the metal particles do not, however, prejudice the characteristics of softness to the touch and elasticity of the padding.
