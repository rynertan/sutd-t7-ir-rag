# Solid state image sensing device and method for making the same.

## Abstract
In a solid state image sensing device of p conductivity type well, photo electro converting region 1 are configu rated to have larger area as depth increases, so that excessive electric charges generated in the p conductivity type well are easily transferred from expanded peripheral parts 7 at the bottom 1b to channel 3 , without being undesirably transferred downward through thin p conductivity type region 6 to substrate 4 , and smear electric charges which has been generated in a thin p conductivity type well under the photo electro converting region 1 in the conventional device is suppressed, to effectively decrease the smear phenomenon.
