For the production of the compound V of the invention, some of the starting materials, namely, the secondary alkylamines and secondary alkylating agents are not easiiy availabie. According to tne present invention, the N monosecondary alkyl m aminophenol compound V is conveniently prepared by reductive alkylation, that is, by subjecting m aminophenol to reductive alkylation with a ketone compound of the formula EMI11.1 wherein R13 and Rl4 are P11 and R12, respectively or groups 11 12 which are converted to P and R12, respectively during the reaction, and P11 and R12 are, same or different, straight or branched C1 C11 alkyl provided that the total number of the carbon atoms of R11 and R12 is 2 to 12.

Specific examples of the catalyst for the reductive alkylation are platinum or palladium catalysts, particularly platinum carried on a carrier eg. carbon, etc. which is prererably slightly poisoned with a sulfurcontaining compound. The reduction is carried out with hydrogen at pressure o 5 to 60 kg cm2, preferably from 10 to 40 kg cmz at a temperature of from 80 to 230 C, preferably from 110 to 2000C. When stoichiometric amount of hydrogen is absorbed and consumed, it is not absorbed any more and unreacted m amincphenol disappears. From the reaction mixture, the catalyst is removed by filtration and the solvent and excessive ketone are remove by distillation or steam distillation. Any soluble material is removed by washing with water or hot water to obtain the desired product. If desired, the product may be further purified by recrystallization or distillation under reduced pressure. Since the reductive alkylation according to the present invention quantitatively proceeds, yield and purity of the N monoalkai m amlnophenol are extremely high.Therefore, the product may be used in a subsequent reaction without isolation or purification. This is commercially advantageous.

Example 42 In the same manner as in Example 40 but using 2 chloro 4 methoxy diphenylamine 1.17 g in place of 2 chloro 4 methoxy diphenylamine, the reaction was carried out. The crude product obtained after distillation of toluene was repeatedly purified from 80 methanol to give white crystalline 2 anilino 3 chloro 6 N l isobutyl 3 methylbutyl N methylamino fluoran 1.5 g M.P. 90 920C.This fluoran compound develops black with silica gel and bisphenol A. Example 43 A mixture of 2 anilino 3 methyl 6 N ethyl N 1 methylpropylamino fluoran 5 parts , a 10 aqueous solution of hydroxyethylcellulose 5 parts and water 15 parts was dispersed by means of glass beads to obtain a dispersion in which particle size of the dispersoid was 2 to 3 microns Dispersion A . Bisphenol k 10 parts , a 10 aqueous solution of hydroxyethylcellulose 10 parts and water 30 parts was dispersed by means of glass beads to obtain a dispersion in which particle size o the dispersoid was 2 to 3 microns Dispersion B . On the other hand, a mixture o powdery calcium carbonate 20 parts , a 5 aqueous solution of methyl cellulose 20 parts and water 60 parts was dispersed to obtain a dispersion Dispersion C . Dispersion A 10 parts , Dispersion B 20 parts and Dispersion C 30 parts were mixed. To the mixture, a 20 aqueous solution of a salt of isobutylene maleic acid copolymer 10 parts was added and stirred. The resultant mixture was coated on a sheet of wood free paper 50g m3 with a wire bar so that an amount of the coated material was 5 g m2 after drying and dried with hot air at 600C for 1 one minute. The thus produced heat sensitive paper was printed by means of a thermal gradient tester at 1500C under a load of 2 kg with contract time of 1 one second to develop a deep black image. When it was printed by means of a printer o a high speed facsimile equipment, its coloring sensitivity was excellent. The developed black image and the undeveloped surface of the recording paper showed extremely good resistance against light, water and a plasticizer. When, as a developer, benzyl p hydroxybenzoate was used in place of bisphenol A, substantially the same resuits were thieved. Example 44 A solution of 2 anilino 3 methyl 6 N ethyl N 1 ethylpropylamino fluoran 5 parts in isopropylnaphthalene 100 parts was added to a solution of gelatin 25 parts and gum arabic 25 parts in water 350 parts kept at 500C and emulsified. To the thus prepared emulsion, warm water 1,000 parts was added and stirred at 500C for 30 minutes, and then 10 aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide 1 part was added and stirred at 500C for 30 minutes.After adjusting pH of the emulsion to 4.5 by the addition o a dilute aqueous solution of acetic acid, the emulsion was stirrec at 500C for 1 one hour and at 50C for 30 minutes. Tn this emulsion, the encapsulating material was cured by gradual addition or a 5 aqueous solution of glutaraldehyde 40 parts . After adjusting pH of the emulsion to 6 with a dilute aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide, it was stirred for several hours at a room temperature. To the thus produced emulsion of capsules, cellulose fine powder 30 parts and a 10 aqueous solution of oxiaized starch iOG parts were added.The resultant mixture was coated on a sheet of base paper 45g m2 so that an amount of the coated material was 5 g m2 after drying and dried to obtain an upper sheet of a pressure sensitive recording paper. The thus produced upper sheet was laminated on a lower sheet on which, as a developer, a formalin nobolac resin of phenol and alkylphenol or a mixture of activated clay treated with an acid and zinc salt of 3,5 bis alphamethylbenzyl sallcylic acid was coated to form a pressure sensitive recording paper. When the recording paper was pressed with a pencil or a type of a typewriter, it developed black. The pressure sensitive recording paper had good shelf stability and high color developing rate. The developed image had good light resistance for G long time and also good resistance against water and a plasticizer.
