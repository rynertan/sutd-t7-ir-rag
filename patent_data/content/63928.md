# Improvements in hydraulic boosters for vehicle braking systems.

## Abstract
In an hydraulic booster for a vehicle braking system a boost piston 3 provides an output force in response to pres surisation of a boost chamber 5 under the control of boost valve means 6 , which controls communication between the boost chamber 5 and a pressure source 63 and the boost chamber 5 and a fluid reservoir 64 . The operation of the boost valve means 6 is controlled by pressure in a control chamber 10 which is pressurised by operation of a pedal op erated input piston 11 . A recuperation valve 14 controls communication between the boost and control chambers, and is operated in response to movement of the input piston 11 . Pressure in the boost chamber 5 acts on the input piston 11 to urge it in a direction to keep the recuperation valve 14 closed. This enables the input piston 11 to work in a bore 12 in the boost piston 3 , with the control chamber 10 in the boost piston 3 and forward of the boost chamber 5 , to pro vide a simple, short booster.
