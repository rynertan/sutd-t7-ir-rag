## Description
BLENDS SUITABLE FOR m E PREPARATION OF FORMED NUT OR CHOCOLATE MORSELS FOR FOOD PRODUCTS The present invention is directed to a mixture suitable for preparing formed nut or chocolate morsels for use in prepared food products or for co forming, as by coextruding, food products. The e prior art consists of natural or artificial nut blends, such as peanut butter, or chocolate morsels. The e chocolate morsels can be packaged in dry mixes or added separately. Such morsels are naturally high in fat and, with the current interest in lower fat foods, a low fat substitute is desirable. In addition, it would be difficult to coextrude such a product to form products with dual texture and taste. The e presence of so much fat would lead to problems such as bleeding, fat migration, and sensitivity to rancidity. There is therefore a need for dry, shelf stable chocolate or nut pieces which are based on chocolate liquors or nut butters, which can be incorporated into dry, cooked, or non cooked preparations and which rehydrate to acceptably textures pieces. A dry blend suitable for the preparation of formed chocolate and or nut pieces consists essentially of 1 30 of chocolate liquor and or nut butter 30 85 sugar 3 12 water 0 15 of a pregelatinized starch 0 30 of a bulking agent and or 0 1 of a gum the percentages being by weight and totalling 100 , the pieces being formed under conditions of low shear and at a low temperature Typically, the mixture contains an edible salt, acid, humectant, and or natural or artificial flavor. Preferably, the blend contains 15 20 chocolate liquor and or nut butter solids 50 80 sugar 2 10 water 2 10 starch and 0.01 0.05 gum. As used herein, the term chocolate liquor includes the use of cocoa and cocoa butter which in combination are equivalent to the liquor. Typically the mixture contains an edible salt, acid, humectant, and or natural or artificial flavor.The presence of the water is necessary for formation however, too much water can lead to the water soluble materials solubilizing and losing shape.This is probably due to the sugar present dissolving and losing its crystalline form. Preferably, the chocolate and or nut blend is processed i.e., worked, transported, and extruded , without the use of external heat, under low shear conditions, and at a low r.p.m., so as to compact and form the extrudate. If necessary, the temperature can be controlled by circulating water or cooling fluids through the hollow shaft and hollowflight forming extruder screws. This may be done in conjunction with, or in place of, the use of jacketed extruder barrels circulating water or a cooling fluid. The e extrudate is warm to the touch, probably at a temperature below 60 C 140 F . Generally, piece sizes and shapes may be changed by changing the die assembly or, in sane cases, by merely changing the die inserts. A variable speed sizing knife at the die permits the control of the extrudate length. Typically, the extrudate benefits fran a brief air cooling between the die and the sizing knife usually for pieces that are to be used as ribbons. If the pieces are to be cut into morsels, the cutting can be carried out as the extrudate leaves the die. Suitable forming mechanisms include forming extruders, a Kitchen Aid meat grinder, a rubber mill, a tablet press, and the like. Particularly suitable are the forming extruders available fran Wenger Manufacturing, Sabetha, Kansas which are available both as single screw and double screw with a splitthinged or sectional barrel.These forming extruders operate at 10 100 r.p.m. in contrast with cooker extruders which operate at 300 500 r.p.m. The extruded cut pieces are conveyed by an air vacuum or on a belt to the cooling area. The e resulting low moisture chocolate and nut pieces have the appearance, texture, and taste of the genuine flavors fran which they are prepared. Flow agents such as specialty starches e.g., DRY FLO available from National Starch and Chemical Corp. , granular sugar, or various silicon dioxides may be applied after the extrusion and cutting steps to prevent agglomeration during storage. Other advantages of these pieces include their all natural flavor and color, good shelf life, low water activity typically less than 0.7 , and ease of handling. In addition, they retain their structural integrity after baking and show minimal flavor loss after baking or freezing, as well as after reheating of finished baked products containing the morsels.The chocolate and or nut blend can also be coextruded to produce foods with dual texture and taste, e.g., chocolate and or nut filled snacks. In addition to being useful in bakery products such as cookies, breads, rolls, and cakes, they can be used in cooked dessert products such as puddings and custards and noncooked products such as ice cream, sherberts and cereal products. As discussed above, chocolate liquor or cocoa in combination with cocoa butter are suitable, as well as nut butters such as peanut butter, hazel nut, almond, and pistachio. Suitable sugars include conventional mono and disaccharides including, for example, sucrose, dextrose, lactose, fructose, corn syrup solids, and mixtures thereof. Preferably, a fine grind such as aConfectioner s sugar is used to improve mouthfeel. Also suitable are synthetic sugars such as polydextrose available from Pfizer Chemical Co. which are low in sweetness. Such sugars may be desirable for use with artificial sweeteners for the preparation of low calorie pieces. The gums suitable for use herein include any of those typically used in food systems, such as alginates, guar gum, locust bean gum, xanthan gum, carageenan, pectin, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, and mixtures thereof. The gums are dissolved in water prior to their addition to the mix. Heat was used, where necessary, to aid in solubilization of the gums, e.g. with a blend of locust bean and xanthan gum. The gum aids in the extrusion by acting as a slip agent however, it is not required.It is preferred because of its water holding properties and film forming which are desirable in the extruded piece. The e food starches preferably present in the blend are typical pregelatinized starches, optionally modified as by stabilization and or crosslinking, which are selected according to the end use for the pieces.The use of crosslinked starches aids in controlling the flow viscosity of the pieces when they are subjected to bakery temperatures. The starch helps to reduce boil out or flow of the pieces under these conditions however, for some end uses e.g. ice cream it is not required. Stabilized starches known for their freeze thaw stability are used in frozen or refrigerated products. Various starch sources can be used including, for example, corn, tapioca, waxy maize, potato, wheat, and the like. The bulking agents suitable for use herein include wheat flour, whey, yeast, and the like. In the examples which follow, all parts arc by weight and all temperatures are in degrees Celsius unless otherwise noted. Example I This example describes the preparation of peanut butter morsels using natural and artificial flavors. A dry blend was formed by thoroughly blending 31.31 parts of finely ground sugar Baker s special , 21.40 parts of dextrose, 19.00 parts of creamy peanut butter, 19.00 parts of yeast powder, 2.80 parts of a modified pregelatinized tapioca food starch, 1.00 part of salt, and 0.50 part of artificial roasted peanut butter flavor.Another blend was prepared by mixing together 0.01 part xanthan gum Keltrol F from Kelco , 0.01 part locust bean gum, and 0.02 part of the above indicated sugar and thoroughly dispersing them in 4.96 parts water.This liquid blend was heated to 1500F 650C and then added to the dry blend and mixing was continued until all the components were thoroughly blended. The peanut butter blend was fed into the feed tube of a Kitchen Aid meat grinder equipped with a die plate having 0.64 cm. 0.25 in. orifices. The e individual extruded strands were separated, allowed to cool to room temperature, and then cut into individual morsels. Example II This example describes the preparation of chocolate morsels using natural flavors. A dry blend was formed as above from 14.30 parts of chocolate liquor melted by heating to 48 55eC 120 1300F , 50.82 parts of sugar, 21.40 parts of dextrose, 4.80 parts Dutched cocoa, 2.80 parts of a modified pregelatinized tapioca food starch, and 0.90 part of salt. A gum solution was prepared and added as in Example I. The chocolate blend was extruded as in Example I. Example III This example shows the use of the morsels to prepare cookies. A total of about 15 of a combination of the chocolate and peanut butter morsels were used in a cookie batter prepared from a dry sugar cookie mix Duncan Hines . The cookies, prepared as drop cookies or bars, had an excellent synergistic flavor and the pieces remained intact. Summarizing, this invention provides a chocolate or nut blend suitable for preparing law moisture pieces and a process for their extrusion under law shear and low temperature conditions, as well as food products containing such pieces.
