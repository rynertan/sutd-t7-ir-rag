# MEMORY SELECTION IN A MULTIPLE LINE ADAPTER ORGANIZATION

## Abstract
A data comm network uses multiple line adapters for controlling communication with various data terminals. Each line adapter, and also a data link interface unit, has its own RAM memory means for buffering of data. An associated microprocessor permits selection of any particular line adapter and its RAM memory means or selection of the data link interface unit RAM memory means.
