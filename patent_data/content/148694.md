# Electronics packaging system.

## Abstract
An electronics packaging system suitable for the hostile operating environment of downhole MWD tools, which has a Y shaped cross sectional chassis on periphery of which are attached a plurality of electronics modules 14a c, 114a d in a delta configuration to give a rigid, high density assembly with convenient cabling channels running axially of the chas sis. Roller supports 22 or annular shoe supports 120 pro vided on the chassis isolate the electronics from the vibration and shock forces experienced by the housing. The metal elas tomer metal construction of the supports offers the resiliency needed for vibration dampening and shock absorption, as well as the ridgidity needed for rolling and controlling the direction of application of the undissipated forces. Heat sinks are provided both above and below electronics elements to rapidly dissemi nate localized heat and to radiate heat generally through the housing walls to an external cooling medium, the drilling mud.
