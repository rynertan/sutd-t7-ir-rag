# Rotating mirror scanner.

## Abstract
In a rotating mirror scanner, a polygonal mirror 46 is fixed between a pair of journals 36, 37 of a spindle 35 . A rotor is fixed on the spindle 35 , and a rotor magnet 50 constituting a magnetic thrust bearing is fixed to one end of the spindle 35 . One bearing 21 of a dynamic pressure type and a ring shaped stator magnet 27 which constitutes the magnetic thrust bearing are both fixed in a hollow housing 10 having an opening. The spindle 35 is inserted into the housing 10 through the opening thereof so that the outer peripheral surface of the rotor magnet 50 faces the inner peripheral surface of the stator magnet 27 , and that one journal 37 is fitted in the one bearing 21 . Thus, the spindle 35 is set in the housing 10 . A cover 31 having the other bearing 32 is fitted in the opening of the housing 10 so that the other journal 36 is supported by the other bearing 32 .
