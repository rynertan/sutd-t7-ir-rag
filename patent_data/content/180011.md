## Description
The present invention relates to power dividers in use in microwave systems and particularly to a 3 dB and 90 directional coupler of the branchline type. It is well known that in a number of microwaves circuits, such as for example mixers, power amplifiers and some more the problem arises to divide or add powers, which problem is generally solved by the use of directional couplers. The power division can be made according to any ratio. The most used ratio is 1 1 which involves a 3 dB directional coupler. At present various types of 3 dB couplers with a 90 phase shift between the coupled ports are used. One of them is the conventional branchline coupler, a second one is the combination of two 8,3 dB couplers to obtain a 3 dB coupler and a third one is the interdigital coupler known in the art as Lange coupler . These types of couplers have, however, various disadvantages, among which the following are the most important. In the conventional branchline type for frequencies higher than 10 GHz the ratio of the wave length to the cross section of the branches is lower than 10 and as a result the propagation conditions are altered inasmuch as modes higher than TEM occur and, in addition, the discontinuities of the four apices are no longer negligible so that matching and directivity problems arise. The same disadvantages occur in the coupler obtained by means of a combination of two 8,3 dB couplers. The third above mentioned type of coupler, i.e the Lange coupler has the disadvantage that it requires at least 2 typically 4 bonds. In addition, all the above mentioned type of couplers require the use of direct current blocking capacitors when active circuits are used inasmuch as the four ports are connected. It is the object of the present invention to obviate these and other disadvantages of the prior art directional couplers. A coupler according to the preamble of claim 1 is known from figure 1 of patent document EP A1 0 066 015. According to the features of the characterising portion of claim 1 the cross section of the branches of the 3 dB and 90 branchline couplers are reduced, thus securing a good operation up to 20 GHz and direct current isolation of the four ports is accomplished so as to eliminate the need for D.C. blocking capacitors when active circuits are used. US A 4.420.839 discloses in deed the use of coupled lines in a hybrid ring mixer. However, it doesn t teach or suggest how by using coupled lines a directional coupler of the 3dB and 90 branchline type could be obtained which has the above mentioned advantages over the prior art directional coupler of the 3dB and 90 branchline type. These and other features of the present invention will become more apparent from the following description of a preferred embodiment thereof given by way of example and in no limiting sense, referring to the accompanying drawings, in which The branchline coupler shown in Fig. 1 is well known to those skilled in the art and is shown here to evidence the circuit modification made by the present invention. In said coupler if the reference impedance is Ro e.g. 50 ohm and the coupler is a 3 dB coupler, then Z1 Ro and Z2 Ro 2. The four ports are indicated with 1, 2, 3 and 4. Referring to Fig. 2, A and B indicate two coupled lines forming the base structure of each branch of the coupler. 5 and 6 indicate the ports used and 7 and 8 the two open ports. W indicates the width of the line and S the distance between the lines. It is well known that two coupled lines are characterized by the following magnitudes the lines having a characteristic impedance equal to Z1 Fig. 1 can be substituted by two coupled lines structures as diagrammatically shown in Fig. 2. The same applies to the characteristic impedance Z2 of Fig. 1. The equivalent circuit for the coupled lines of Fig. 2 is shown in Fig. 3 and needs no further description for a person skilled in the art. The coupler according to the invention using the coupled lines of Fig. 2 can take, e.g., the geometry illustrated in Fig. 4. In it, 10, 20, 30, 40 indicate the port corresponding to the ports 1, 2, 3, 4 of Fig. 1. A1 B1, A2 B2 are coupled lines which in the present invention are made of microstrips however obtained. Microstrips are well known in the technics of electronic components. The coupling between the lines A1 and B1, A2 and B2 is provided by way of example, by means of the inner outer exchange evidenced in Fig. 4. Other geometries could be, however, provided. The operation of the circuit of Fig. 4 is illustrated diagrammatically by means of the equivalent circuit of Fig. 5, which operation becomes apparent as an application of the equivalent circuit of an individual branch shown in Fig. 3. In Fig. 5, Z1 indicates the quantity and Z2 indicates the quantity where Z1 and Z2 are the impedances of the branches of the branchline. These impedance values will be obviously obtained by suitably sizing the microstrips A1, B1, A2, B2 forming the four branches, in particular the width W Fig. 2 of the lines and the distance S between the lines.
