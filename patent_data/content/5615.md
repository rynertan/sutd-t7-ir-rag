## Description
A protective device for parts of the bodyThis invention relates to a protective device for parts of the body and is able to be used to function as a medical support while curative treatment is being undertaken, or as a protective device during an event, such as a sporting event. iien an injury to a limb or other part of a body occurs such as breakage or a severe strain it is necessary in order to be able to cure the limb to hold it securely and rigid in a prescribed position. Sometimes it is necessary for the limb to be held temporarily such as when a patient is being removed to hospital and in such cases splint and bandage arranements are usually used.These are useful as an immediate treatment but can be uncomfortable for the wearer and are not necessarily convenient to carry and to apply at the scene of an accident. It is therefore a requirement tzt a readily srr icable easily portable protective device which gives adequate and confortable support be available and the present invention has for an object to provide such a device.Similarly in hospitals and the like surgeons will set limbs and strained parts of the body in casts which conventionally are made from pl2ster of paris. This sets rigid, is messy to apply, and is often uncomfortable for the patient since it is very heavy and once applied cannot readily be removed. If it is applied so as to cause discomfort a surgeon is reluctant to remove it since it has to be destroyed and a new cast made.Also the injured part cannot be examined at will.It is another object of the invention to provide a protective device which gives the same degree of support as a plaster cast but which is more easily applied and which can be readily removed and replaced and which also is light and comfortable for the wearer.In many sporting activities, particularly those involving hard balls, the players find it necessary to protect vulnerable parts of their body from damage which might occur from hard knocks. They require a protective device which is light and comfortable and which is also able to be removed at will. It is a further object of the invention to provide such a device.According to the present invention a protective device for parts of the body comprises a sheet of energy absorbing cellular material having a contoured edge, the sheet being bendable to fit around a selected part of the body, and fastening means for securing the device around the selected part.By being of an energy absorbing qrial such as a closed cell plastics material the device offers the advantage of protection against shock from knocks.This can be enhanced by including a laminated layer of a stiffening material. An outer protective layer may further be added to enable the device to be kept clean, dry and undamaged by accidental knocks.In order that the wearer s skin may be properly ventilated an open cell layer of soft material can with advantage be placed next to the skin and ventilation holes may be formed through all t layers.For sporting applications the outer layer may be constructed from a cellular material, preferably of a closed cell material. In order to fit around a part of a body better the energy absorbing cellular material may be selected as a material having virtually no memory.To permit easy and ready removal of the device straps can be formed on, or secured around, the device.The straps may have their own buckles or may also, or alternatively, be secured with self fastening means such as hook and pile fasteners.The sheet like protective cast material has several other advantabes, aong which are the following. hen formed into cylinders the inner walls do not uniformly contact all skin surfaces, providing ventilation over the skin. The devices can be economically produced, shipped and stored. One device is adjustable and useful to fit a wide range of varied sizes. It is also able to be reused. Ti e devices are able to be used with other materials necessary, such as wood so that a foot support is able to be constructed and the layers of the device nailed to the sole member. The sole member may then be of a durable material and fitted with a non shine surface to ensure easy walking. Alternatively it may be preferable to secure the device over and above a normal shoe.The device is referred to hereinafter as a cast in order that it may be equated in the reader s mind with medical applications, although it is to. be appreciated it is not limited to such applications.When the material is bent in one direction it gives the advantage that it will resist bending in another direction.

The device is secured by threading retaining strap member 59d through buckle 650 and retaining strap member 600 through buckle 652.The ends of the retaining strap members are secured by the self fastening material.The cast is shown in Figure 31 from the position of a person sitting on a table who is about to place the cast around his left knee and outstretched left leg. ridge 704 represents the shorter distal edge of the cast and edge 706 represents the larger proxial edge of the cast. Dodge 708 is placed along the outer side of the knee and the cast is bent around the knee, juxtaposing or superimposing edge 710 over edge 708 with flaps 712 overlying the outside of the cast and extending rearward. Ventilating openings 714 are provided throughout the cast. Parallel strips 716 of small hook type fasteners 718 are provided on the outer surface 702 near edge 708. T e inside 720 of cast 701, as shown in Figure 31, has coaplement2ry patches 722 of pile type fasteners 724 on flaps 712.An oval annular shape insert 726 of closed cell foam .. serial is glued to the inside 720 of the knee cast 71 in an area which overlies the knee cap. In a preferred e bodiment, the annular oval insert has an overall dimension of about 10 cms by 7.5 cms by 1.25 cms 4 inches by 3 inches by i inch in thickness with the central opening being approximately 2.5 cms by 5 cms 1 inch by 2 inches . The oval shaped insert removes facial or lateral pressure from the knee cap and at the same time laterally stabilises the knee cap with respect to the cast. A facial wall 728 of the insert 726 is approsimately 2.5 cms 1 inch across.In one embodiment annular piece 726 is generally circular at its cut out middle position is used as a knee backing pad 732.Cylindrical insert 732 is positioned behind the knee.Insert 732 is formed as a segment of a cylinder and has circular lateral edges 734. Edges 736 are bonded to the inner surface 720 of the knee cast. A ventilation opening 738 Is provided.Cylindrical insert 732 preferably has a strip of hooktype fasteners on a flat outer face which engages a relatively long strip of pile type fasteners on inner surface 720 of the cast to adjust for varying knee sizes. The entire rear face of the anterior insert 732 may be bonded to the interior surface 720 of the knee cast or the central portion may be spaced from the inner surface 720.An insert 740 positioned below the anterior of the knee fits beneath the calf muscle of the leg and aids the uniform contact of the cast with the leg around the knee area to immobilise the knee.The knee cast described in Figures 30 and 31 may be constructed with straps such as shown in Figure 29 replacing the straps 724. Alternatively, the knee cast may be provided wit short straps which loop through openings along edge 708.The cast described with reference to Figures 30 and 31 may be dimensionally modified and used when it is necessary to hold the elbow in an unextended position.An elbow cast for a flexed elbow is described with reference to Figures 32 and 33. The elbow cast 741 has an exterior 742 which may be formed of a stiffening member or a stiffening member covered by a sheet material.The interior 743 is a closed cell foam material.Together, as is the case with other embodiments of the protective case, the closed cell foam material and the stiffening member cooperate so that when the foam material and the stiffening member are bent around one axis it is difficult if not impossible to flex the combined materials about any other non concurrent or non parallel axes.The elbow cast has a generally cylindrical upper edge 744 and a generally cylindrical upper portion 745. A generally cylindrical lower edge 746 terminates a generally cylindrical lower portion 747. Frontal edges 748 and 750 connect the upper and bower edges 744 and 746 and extend over a central transitional area 749 where the cylindrical portions 745. and 747 join.A flap 752 extends inward from edge 750 across the inside of the elbow, Straps 754, having pile type fasteners 755 across the major portion of their facial areas, are extended through fastening openings 756.Bulling on the straps through the opening and folding the straps back so that hook type fasteners 758 near their distal ends engage the pipe type fastener 755 secures the cast on the elbow.A soft portion 760 of closed cell material which is devoid of a stiffening member extends across te outer elbow. Lower surface 764 of the elbow cast is formed without a seam. A rearward portion 766 of the upper portion 745 has a central seam 767 so that the elbow cast may be made of a single flat piece of material which is folded upward and joined along seam 767. Seam 768 may continue the seam 767 through the soft central member 760. Openings 769 are provided for ventilation and to prevent wrinkling of the sheet material as it is bent into cylindrical shape.A foot cast 770 is shown with reference to Figures 34 and 35.Foot cast 770 has a hard exterior surface 772 which may be formed of the outer surface of a stiffening member or a stiffening member covered by a sheet material. Inner surface 774 is constructed of a foam material. Together the closed cell foam material and the thin stiffening material form an arch like structure which, when bent around one axis, is difficult to bend around any other axes. The compressed foam in the arch like structure cooperates with the stressed stiffening member to form a rigid cast device.The foot cast is ade of a single piece of foam ana stiffening material which is bent forwardly t scred to a sole. An upper portion 775 is formed erally as a cylinder with an upper circular edge 776. Lower side portions 777 terminate forwardly in edges 778. Lower edes 780 are nailed 782 and bonded or otherwise secured to a sole. orrd edges 784 of the foot cast are interrupted by notches 786 which permit bending of the upper portion 775 and the lower portion 777 about intersecting axes. The two portions are integrally joined along an imaginary line 787 which is common to both curves.Straps 792 have interfaces of proximal ends bonded to outer surface 772 of the fcot cast. Pile type fasteners 794 along the outer miodle portion of the straps cooperate with hook type fasteners 796 on the iller surfaces of distal ends of the strap. The distal ends of the straps are passed through holes 798 and are pulled tight before folding the distal ends back over the middle portions of the straps so that the hook type fasteners 796 engage the pile type fasteners 794. Ventilation holes 799 are provided throughout the cast.The base 802 of the foot cast is made of a rigid construction which may be wood. A lower surface 804 may be coated with a non slip surface such as a patterned rubber sheet. An upper surface 806 of base 802 may be contoured to fit a sole of a foot or may have 2 contoured layer attached thereto. h rigid partially cylindrical block 808 with a rough lower surface 807 may be mounted beneath the base to facilitate walking on the cast. The outer and inner layers extend downward over opposite sides of block 808 to edges 809 and are bonded and nailed to the block to provide increased strength.A tongue 810 is mounted inside the educe 784 of the cast. The tongue has an outer layer of closed cell foam material and an inner layer of open cell foam material for contacting the foot. The entire cast as well as other casts, may be constructed with open cell inner layers to provide ventilation throughout the cast near the skin of the wearer. The tongue has an upper portion 816 and a lower portion 818 and the straps 792 overlie the tongue.As shown in Figure 35, the tongue is joined to an edge of the cast body in the upper portion 816. The lower edge 820 is free from the cast body. As shown inFigure 35, the lower end of the tongue may be rounded to promote comfort. One or more ventilation openings 822 are provided in the tongue. A central opening is significant additionally to provide flexure of the tongue between the upper and lower portions.The free edge 824 of the tongue fits under the corresponding edge of the foot cast.A cushion 826 is provided in the rear of the cast to cushion the heel portion and Achilles tendon area of a foot and ankle.Wrists casts are shown in Figures 36, 37 and 38.Wrists cast 830 shown in Figure 36 has an outer surface 832 which may comprise an outer surface of a stiffening material or a stiffening material covered by a sheet material. An inner surface 834 is constructed of closed cell foam. A semi cylindrical support 836 is bonded to the inner surface among edge 838 in an area adjacent the v rist. Opposite edge 840 has a plurality of straps 842, 844 and 48 which are integrally formed from the foam and skin material as flaps. Flap 842 has on its inner surface a strip of pile type fasteners which engage a strip of hook type fasteners 843 along the wrist edge of the wrist cast. Central flap 844 in a similar manner has pile type fasteners which engage a strip 846 of hook type fasteners in a central portion of the cast.Flap 848 has on its interior pile type fasteners which engage sloped strip 847 of hook type fasteners which is bonded to the outer surface 832 near the palm end of the cast.In the cast silown in Figure 36, the cast is placed around the arm with the inside of the wrist carried on a semi cylindrical insert 836. Flap 848 is folded around the palm betwen the thumb and the first finger nd is secured to strip 847.The insert 836 is formed of a closed cell foam material.The insert in the entire cast may be lined with an open celled foam material to aid circulation of air.As shown in Figure 37, cast 850 has an outer surface 852 and an inner surface 854, similar to the other casts.A semi cylindrical insert 856 is bonded to the inner surface near lateral edge 859.The arm opening edge 858 is substantially straight across. Edge 860 is curved to overlie the first joints of the fingers along the back of the hand and dips toward the wrist to expose the heel of the hand and the base of the palm adjacent the thumb along edge 862. Side 866 of the cast underlies the wrist area and insert 856 overlies the back of the hand and the wrist area.Edges 868 and 869 are recessed to lie along the inside of the distal end of the arm. Straps 870 are bonded to the outer surface 852 and have ends 872 which extend through openings along the opposite edges and are folded upon themselves, securing the straps with hook and pile fasteners. Strap 882 is bonded to the outer surface of area 880 which overlies the back of the hand near the first joint of the little finger. The strap has hook fasteners 884 near its distal end o86 so that when the strap is pulled tight through opening 888 and folded upon itself, the hook fasteners cooperate with pile type fasteners on the outer surface of the remainder of the strap.The wrist cast 890 shown in Figure 38 is constructed similarly to the wrist cast 850 shown in Figure 37. The most significant difference is found in the lower portion 892 of the cast which underlies the first joint areas of the fingers along the inside of the palm. Edge 894 exposes the thumb and edge 896 encircles the hand along the first joints of the fingers. dge 898 terminates along the first joint of the index finger.Pulling the straps through the openings and securing them upon themselves immobilizes the band and wrist.Finger and thumb casts are described with reference to Figures 39, 40 and 41.Cast 900 shown in Figure 39 h an outer surface and an inner surface constructed U milarly to the outer and inner surfaces of the casts previously described. Outer surface 902 is constructed of a stiffening material or a stiffening material covered by a sheet material.Inner surface 904 is constructed of the closed cell foam. When the two joined materials are bent around the first axis, the materials may not be bent around further axes. An upper edge 906 encircles a wrist area of a hand, and a lover edge 908 encircles the thumb or fingers of a wearer. Flap 910 on the lower edge extends beneath flap 912. oo tpe fasteners are mounted on the outer surface flap 910 and pile type fasteners are mounted on the coplenentary inner surface of flap 912.The major flap 913 extends around the base of the palm, leaving the palm exposed. The flap 913 has inward facing pile type fasteners which engage hooks on a slanted strip of hook fasteners shown in hidden lines 915.The view in Figure 39 is taken from the direction of the thumb side of the hand with the flap 912 being shown in its open position. dge 914 extends downward along the thumb on the palm side of the hand, and flap 913 extends around the palm side of the hand along the shield of the hand to expose the entire palm such as for use during sports. dodge 19 extends down between the thumb and first finger across the back of the hand. With this cast the thumb is supported against shock and outward movement while substantially all the hand remains free for use.Figure 40 shows another embodiment of a thumb immobilising cast 920. The outer surface 922 is formed of a stiffening member which is bonded directly to a closed cell foam material 928. The upper edge 924 extends around the wrist of the wearer, covering the heel of the hand and the opposite back of the hand with the major portion of the cast. The smaller portion of the cast 930 fits around the outside of the thumb of the wearer so that the lower edge lies in the area of the outer joint of the thumb. The inner edge 933 of the thumb portion 930 lies along the thumb.Edges 934 lie along the outer edge of the hand, and edges 936 diagonally overlie the palm of the hand and the back of the hand. A strip of hook fasteners 940 is mounted around the outer surface of the thumb portion. A separate strip 942 of inward facing pile fasteners is attached first at one end of 944 to the hook strip 940. Then strip 942 is pulled tight and the opposite end of the strip 942 is attached to the hook strip 940. Strap 946 having pile type fasteners is bonded to the outer surface 922. Free end 947 is passed through an opening similar to opening 948 shov n in Figure 41 and the free end is pulled tight and the hooks on its inner surface are pressed on to the piles on the outer surface of strap 946.A similar sports type thumb supporting cast 950 is shown in Figure 41. As in cast 920, the thumb is immobilised with respect to the hand so that the thumb must move with the hand. The thumb covering portion 952 is elongated with respect to the base portion.Edges 954 expose the heel porti n of the hand so that the entire palm of the hand is exposed such as for contact with sports equipment. Edge 956 lie along the side of the thumb, leaving the inside surface of the thumb exposed for contact sensation.As shown in Figure 42 the basic construction of protective cast 960 of the present invention takes the form of an exoskeleton. Stiffening material 962 is placed as far outward as possible and closed cell foam material 964 is bonded entirely along the inner surface of the stiffening member 962. When opposite ends of the structure 960 are bent dovmward around an axis extending perpendicularly to the drawing for example, the closed cell foam material is placed under a compressive stress which tends to push the stiffening member outward into a desired uniform arcuate shape without irregular formations or abrupt changes. The stiffening member and the closed cell foam material thus cooperate to readily permit bending about one axis, but once bent to prevent bending about any other axis thereby forming a rigid cast about a body member or part, limb, or extremity.In some cases as shown in Figure 43 it is desirable to zed an inner layer 966 of open cell foam material which evenly distributes pressure and increases ventilation across the inner skin contacting surface of the cast.As shown in Figure 44, in some embodiments of the invention it is desirable to place a decorative and protective outer coating 968 on the outer surface of stiffening element 962. In Figure 45, the terminating of the stiffening member 962 short of the outward termination of the closed cell foam material 964 is shown. The outer coating 968 extends over the edge 970 of the stiffening material 962 and tightly bonds to the exposed outward edge area 972 of the closed cell foam material 964.As shown in Figure 46, when the cast is constructed for use in situations in which blows on the outer surface of the cast might be expected, such as for use in sporting activities, a closed cell foam msterial 974 is bonded to the outer surface of stiffening material 962. The stretching of the closed cell material aids in the rigidity of the cast while at the same time protecting the wearer and those coming in contact with the cast from injury due to contact or shock.In Figure 47 a preferred light weight embodiment 980 of the invention is shown. The embodiment 980 employs a bendable expanded material 982 which preferably has no memory and stays in its bended shape. In one embodiment an expanded material 982, which may comprise a foam material which is preferably a closed cell foam material, has an open cell foam material 984 secured to its inner side. A tough flexible layer 986 which is freely flexible and bendable in all directions is bonded to the outside of the outer material 962. In an embodiment 988 shovm in Figure 48, the tough flexible leather like outer layer 986 is omitted. In the latter case, openings in the layers for receiving straps are reinforced to provide long wearing characteristics and to prevent creep or size change of the openings. The expanded outer layer 982 becomes substantially rigid when bent into a generally cylindrical form and resists bending in any other direction. The inner layer 984 of open cell material provides air circulation and comfort.The outer layer 986 when used in the embodiment shown in Figure 47 tends to stretch and tends to press outer expanded layer 982 when the device is bent in cylindrical shape which further aids the rigidity of the protective cast. Tough, thin, flexible outer surface 986 also promotes cleanliness of the cast and adds long wearing characteristics.In all cases, the casts are constructed with ventilating openings which extend through the closedcell foam material and through the stiffening material. No loss of rigidity is experienced by using a large number of such openings.The preferred closings for the casts are four in number. The most desirable closing, which is most effective and uniquely permits closure using one hand, is a short strap bonded to the outer surface of the protective cast and having pile type fasteners along a major portion of the outer surface of tile strap. A short end portion of the strap has hook type fasteners upon its same outer surface in continuation of the pile surface. The free end of the strap is placed through an opening through the foam material and stiffening member along an opposite edge of the protective cast. Then the person pulls the free end toward the fixed end of the strap.This permits a person to pull opposite edges of the cast together and close the cast with one hand while at the same time doubling the force of pulling due to the mechanical advantage that the strap provides. Other preferred forms of closure are the bonding of hook patches on external surfaces of the cast and bondingpile material on internal surfaces of flaps extended from the cast, which flaps usually are devoid of stiffening material.Another preferred form of closure is by the use of straps which extend co pletely around the cast and are secured by slits forming loops in the outer covering material and which straps have rings at one end for receiving an opposite free end and folding the free end back upon itself with hooks on the free end contacting piles on remainders of the straps.The devices of the invention described above serve a dual purpose in protecting various parts of the body.The devices can be worn to protect the body from injury while engaging in contact sports and the like. The devices can also be worn on an injured part of the body as a temporary or permanent splint during healing thereof. The devices are particularly useful as temporary splints because they can be easily and quickly placed and tightly retained around a body part to maintain the body part, particularly the joints, in an immobilised and unmovable condition. The devices of the invention provide the desired protection by virtue of the cylindrical form of the device as it is worn on the body part. The bendable material being impact resistant serves to protect the body part from blows and or shocks while at the same time maintaining the body part in a rigid immobilised condition. The recessed periphery design of the bendable material is for the purpose of preventing the peripheral edge of the bendable material from contacting and possibly injuring the body part. Any contact of the body part with the peripl.eral edge of the device is absorbed by the secured peripheral edges of the ergy absorbing materials in the inner and outer layers.
