# Comparator circuit having full supply common mode input.

## Abstract
A circuit for comparing first and second input voltages which may vary between a first supply voltage V and a second lower supply voltage ground , said circuit being adapted to be powered by said first and second supply voltages V , ground and comprising current mirror means 18,20 coupled to an output node 6 of said circuit first transistor means 8,10,12,14 coupled to said current mirror means 18,20 and to said output node 6 for supplying a mirrorable current to said current mirror means 18,20 to reduce the voltage at said output node 6 when said first input voltage is slightly less than said second input voltage, and said second input voltage is slightly less than or substantially equal to said first supply voltage V , and for supplying current to said output node 6 to increase the voltage at said output node 6 when said second input voltage is slightly less than said first input voltage, and said first input voltage is slightly less than or substantially equal to said first supply voltage V and second transistor means 22,24,26,28,30 coupled to said current mirror means 18,20 and to said output node 6 for supplying a mirrorable current to said current mirror means 18,20 to reduce the voltage at said output node 6 when said first input voltage is slightly less than said second input voltage, and said first input voltage is slightly greater than or substantially equal to said second supply voltage ground , and for supplying current to said output node 6 to increase the voltage at said output node 6 when said second input voltage is slightly less than said first input voltage and said second input voltage is slightly greater than or substantially equal to said second supply voltage ground .
