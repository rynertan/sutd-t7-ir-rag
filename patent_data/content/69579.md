# Piston for internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
A piston is formed by a metal sleeve 14 heat shrunk onto a core 24 of refractory material, preferably a ceramic. The core 24 has a hemi spherical recess 32 in its inner end and the connecting rod 12 has a ball head 34 trapped in this recess by a retaining ring 13 screwed into the inner end of the sleeve 14 . The core 24 is pre stressed in compress ion and remains compressively stressed throughout the engine operating cycle and thus free from risk of cracking.
