# Underwater transducers.

## Abstract
A transducer for sensing transient elastic waves in metallic components particularly in steel weldments below water on offshore structures comprises a piezoelectric sensing element 1 for coupling to the metallic component and shielded from noise arriving in directions other than the component by an elastomeric encapsulation 22 such as of aerated polyurethane.
