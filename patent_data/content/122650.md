# Toner composition for use in the developing of electrostatic charge patterns.

## Abstract
A composition of matter for use in the developing of electrostatic charge patterns, wherein said composition is in the form of toner particles that have a net positive charge and contain a thermoplastic resin binder for a salt formed from a nigrosine base and at least one carboxylic acid containing one or two carboxylic acid groups and having from 2 to 26 carbon atoms, characterized in that said nigrosine salt is dispersed in a thermoplastic resin binder containing a polyester derived from fumaric acid or a mixture of fumaric acid and isophthalic acid wherein the fumaric acid represents at least 95 mole of the acids and a polyol blend of propoxylated bisphenol.
