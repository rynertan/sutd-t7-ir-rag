# Rotary regenerator type ceramic heat exchanger.

## Abstract
A rotary regenerator type ceramic heat exchanger has a hollow hub 4 and a honeycomb structural body 1 secured to the outer circumference of the hub. To reduce cracking at the connection of the hub and the body due to thermal stress, a stress relief layer 6 having a coefficient of thermal expansion at 800 C not more than 0.1 different from that of the hub.
