# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CONTROLLING INDUSTRIAL ROBOT

## Abstract
A method and an apparatus for controlling an industrial robot is disclosed which has a step or detector 9 for directly sensing the position of a finger portion 8 of the robot, a data processing instruction generator 32 for determining a con trol quantity of the finger portion 8 and transmitting instruc tions corresponding to the control quantity, a step or sensor 39 for indirectly detecting the position and posture of the finger portion 8 by sensing the numbers of revolutions of the driving sources 37 and switching means 32 for selectively changing control modes of the robot between one control mode using the detector 9 and to another control mode us ing the sensor 39 .
