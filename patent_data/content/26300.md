# Light source apparatus for endoscope.

## Abstract
A light source device for an endoscope comprising a xenon lamp 42 , a lamp drive circuit 8 for supplying current to the xenon lamp 42 for causing the burning thereof when a synchronizing signal is supplied from a camera 22 , an integ rating circuit 6 for integrating current supplied from the camera 22 and an illumination stop circuit 7 for supplying an illumination stop signal to a lamp drive circuit 8 when the output of said integrating circuit 6 reaches a predetermined value. The device further comprises a first timer circuit 1 for producing a first signal for a first predetermined period of time according to the synchronizing signal from the camera 22 , a second timer circuit 2 for producing a second signal for a second predetermined period of time after the vanish ment of the output of the first timer circuit 1 , and a gate circuit 3 for rendering the second timer circuit 2 non conductive during the presence of the second signal, the syn chronizing signal from the camera 22 being supplied through the gate circuit 3 to the lamp drive circuit 8 .
