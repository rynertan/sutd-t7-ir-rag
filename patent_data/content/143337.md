# Magnetic recording medium.

## Abstract
A magnetic recording medium comprized of a non mag netic substrate and a magnetic layer formed on one surface of the substrate and consisting essentially of a binder and mag netic powders. As the binder, a thermoplastic polyurethane urea resin is employed, in which hydrophilic polar groups are introduced. The thermoplastic polyurethane urea resin con tains urethane and urea bonds in the molecule thereof and may be synthesized from a long chain diol with a molecular weight of about 500 to 5000, a short chain diol with a molecular weight of about 50 to 500, an organic diisocyanate and an organic di amine. Examples of the thus introduced hydrophilic polar groups are SO₃M, OSO₃M, COOM and OM ₂.
