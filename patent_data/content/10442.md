# Powder metal composition.

## Abstract
A powder metal composition contains 1.0 to 2.5 Ni, 0.3 to 0.7 Mo, 0.15 to 0.30 Mn, 0.5 to 1.5 Cu, 0.3 to 0.7 C, 0.50 to 1.0 zinc stearate, the balance being Fe. Such a com position has surprisingly good physical properties particu larly tensile strength and fracture toughness.
