# Low pass filtering circuit and method of using the same.

## Abstract
A filtering circuit having the behavior of a low pass fil ter capable of having a long time constant. The filtering circuit comprises an input circuit 10 for receiving a volt age input signal to be filtered. A comparator circuit 11 is provided for monitoring the input signal relative to an ana log output signal from an accumulator circuit 13 and pro viding an error signal representative of the difference of the input and output signals. The error signal is fed to a voltage controlled osciilator 17 to generate a frequency signal proportional to the error signal. A frequency dividing circuit 14 is provided to divide the frequency signal by a predetermined division factor to control the low cut off frequency of the filtering circuit whereby to increase the response time thereof. An accumulator 13 is provided to integrate the frequency signal. An output circuit 33 pro vides an output of the stored integrated frequency signal to constitute the analog output signal.
