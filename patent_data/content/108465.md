# A method and an apparatus for trilaterally opening an envelope.

## Abstract
A method of opening an envelope along three edges, in which the envelope is moved to an opening or edge removing device 21 along a supply path, one edge being guided along said device for cutting open or removing the edge, and subsequently is rotated through 90 to be subse quently guided again along the opening or edge removing device 21 for preparing the second edge, which cycle is repeated for the third edge, as well as an apparatus for performing this method, comprising a housing 1 having an inlet 28 connected to the supply path, along which the opening or edge removing device 21 is arranged and which is provided with a first set of members 11, 3 for moving and guiding the envelope co extensively with the inlet 28 , and a second set of members 18, 17 for moving and guiding the same in a direction perpendicular to the first and beyond and along the opening or edge removing device 21 which second set of members 18, 17 is connected to a third set of members 23 26, 2 for guiding and moving the same along a quarter circular path, which third set of members 23 26, 2 provides a path connection to the first set of members downstream of the inlet 28 .
