# System and method for resist defect measurement on semiconductors.

## Abstract
A non destructive test for determining the number, size and location of pinhole defects 14, 16 in insulative coatings 12 on a semiconductor substrate 10 employing photo cathodic current measurement at the semiconductor surface. This current is produced by contacting the coated semicon ductor with an aqueous electrolyte 18 , applying a small electrical bias with respect to a metal electrode 20 , and scanning a small, focused light beam 28 over the semicon ductor surface. The frequency of current peaks produced is proportional to defect density. Current peaks provide data relative to defect size and are correlated to scanning data to determine defect location.
