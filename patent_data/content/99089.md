# Injection molding nozzle seal and method for the manufacture thereof.

## Abstract
This invention relates to an improved hot tip nozzle seal for use in a sprue gated injection molding system and a method of manufacture. The nozzle seal has a cylindrical outer portion, an elongated central pin portion and a number of ribs extending therebetween to define a number of apertures through the nozzle seal. The outer portion is seated in both the heated nozzle and the cavity plate to bridge the insulative air gap between them. As well as preventing the melt flowing into the air gap, this locates the heated nozzle relative to the cavity plate and accurately locates the pin portion in the center of the gate. The melt passage extends through the heated nozzle bore, through the apertures in the seal and through the gate into the cavity. The central pin portion of the seal has a tip portion which extends down stream into the gate and a head portion which extends upstream into the nozzle bore. The central pin portion has an inner conductive portion formed of copper and an outer protective casing formed of steel. The seal is designed so that the head portion picks up a predetermined amount of heat from the surrounding melt and transfers it through the highly conductive copper to the tip portion which extends to where it is required, without being unacceptably susceptible to abrasion or corrosion from difficult materials such as glass filled flame retardant nylon. The seal is made by integrally filling the steel pin casing with copper in a vacuum furnace. The filled casing is then brazed into a body portion with the ribs and a cap brazed on in the vacuum furnace to provide the integral abrasion and corrosion resistant nozzle seal.
