## Description
This invention relates to new 9 phosphonylmethoxyalkyl adenines as well as their preparation and utilization. Phosphonylmethyl ethers of alcohols O substituted hydroxymethanephosphonic acids are analogues of esters of these alcohols with phosphoric acid, differing from the latter in having a chemically and enzymatically stable ether linkage. Since phosphoric acid esters, e.g. nucleotides, phosphoglyceric acid, sugar phosphates etc., are of great importance for metabolic processes in the living matter, such analogues may also be biologically active. The said compounds can be prepared e.g. by reaction of alcohols with chloromethanephosphonic acid or its esters E.N. Walsh, T.M. Beck, A.D.F. Toy J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 9 Alkyladenines containing one or more hydroxy groups in the alkyl chain behave as analogues of the metabolite adenosine and exhibit various biological activities e.g. antiviral, chemosterilizing etc., see Czech. Author s Certificate N This invention relates to 9 phosphonylmethoxyalkyl adenines of the general formula I wherein R is a CH₂, CH CH₃ , CH₂ CH₂ or CH OCH₃ CH₂ group and the salts thereof with alkali metals, ammonia or amines. Further, the invention relates to the method of preparing compounds of the general formula I, characterized in that 9 hydroxyalkyladenines of the general formula II wherein R³ is a benzoyl group, R⁴ is a hydrogen atom or a benzoyl group, or both R³ and R⁴ together are a dimethylaminomethylene group, and R is as defined above, are brought into a reaction with 1 to 2 equivalents relative to compound II of sodium hydride in a dipolar aprotic solvent, preferably dimethylformamide, and with 1 to 2 molar equivalents of an ester of p toluenesulfonyloxymethanephosphonic acid of the general formula III, wherein R⁵ is a methyl or ethyl group, wherein R and R⁵ have the same signification as in the formula I and III, The starting compounds of the general formula II are accessible by reactions of suitably activated alcohols e.g. tosyl or mesyl derivatives or alkyl halides with salts of adenine, usually in dimethylformamide see e.g. A. Holý Collect. Czech. Chem. Commun. The method of preparing the compounds according to this invention is based on formation of sodium salts of 9 hydroxyalkyladenine of the general formula II which contain an isolated hydroxy group. In order to prevent reaction of sodium hydride, used in the preparation of the salts, with other functionalities in the molecule, particularly those bonded to the heterocyclic adenine base, it is necessary to protect them with aroyl benzoyl groups or preferably with the N dimethylaminomethylene group which can be easily introduced by reaction with the so called dimethylformamide acetals dialkoxymethyldimethylamines . The salts of thus protected starting compounds of the formula II are prepared by addition of an equivalent amount or a slight excess of sodium hydride to a solution of compounds II in a solvent which does not react with sodium hydride, preferably dimethylformamide. These salts of compounds of the general formula II are then condensed with tosylates of the general formula III which are easily accessible from diesters or triesters of phosphoric acid Czech. Author s Certificate N The reaction mixtures are worked up simply by dilution with water. The arising alkaline medium removes the protecting groups aroyl or dimethylaminomethylene together with one of the two groups bonded to the phosphonic acid by ester bonds. The arising monophosphonates of the general formula IV are not hydrolyzed further and can be easily isolated from the mixture, preferably by deionization of the adenine derivatives on strongly acidic ion exchangers. Compounds of the general formula IV, obtained by desalting, are purified by chromatography, e.g. on an anion exchanging resin or octadecyl silica gel. In the reaction with trimethyliodosilane, dried compounds of the formula IV are dissolved in dimethylformamide and mixed with the reagent or its solution in dimethylformamide . The amount of the reagent taken is at least twice of that calculated for the number of equivalents of compound IV taking into account all the hydroxy or amino groups present in its molecule . Trimethyliodosilane can be also prepared in situ by reaction of trimethylchlorosilane with sodium, lithium or potassium iodidesin dimethylformamide. The reaction of compounds of the formula IV with trimethyliodosilane is carried out under anhydrous conditions, the reaction time being usualy 18 24 hours at room temperature. The reaction mixture is then decomposed by addition of a neutral or weakly alkaline buffer, e.g. the volatile triethylammonium hydrogen carbonate, and compounds of the general formula I are desalted, preferably using a medium acidic cation exchanging resin from which, after removal of the salts, they are eluted with a volatile base such as aqueous ammonia. Compounds of the formula I are purified by chromatography on anion exchanging resins in neutral or acidic medium, or on octadecyl silica gel. Compounds of the general formula I and V can be stored as free acids or their salts, prepared either by exact neutralization of the free acids or conversion of their ammonium salts into alkali metal salts using cation exchanging resins in the appropriate form. The advantage of the last mentioned salts sodium and lithium salts is their good solubility in water. The method of preparing compounds of the formula I according to the invention can be used also for preparation of individual isomers of phosphonylmethoxyalkyladenines derived from di or trihydroxyalkyladenines, i.e. when the mentioned preparation of these compounds by reaction with chloromethanephosphonyl chloride followed by alkaline hydrolysis Czech Author s Certificate N The compounds of the general formula I which are the subject of this invention, are important active components of antiviral drugs.
