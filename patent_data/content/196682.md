# Fluidized bed heater, reactor and method for semiconductor processing.

## Abstract
A fluidized bed heater for uniformly raising the surface temperature of semiconductor wafers. The heater includes a mantle 2 having at least one planar surface 2U, 2V for supporting wafers 4a,4b , a bed of particles adjacent the mantle which is fluidized by passing a gas through the particle bed, and a bed heater 6 which heats the bed particles to a uniform temperature so that wafers supported on the planar surface are heated to a uniform temperature. A reactor is also described which contains a reactor chamber for processing semiconductor wafers and a fluidized bed heater for uniformly heating semiconductor wafers in the reactor chamber.
