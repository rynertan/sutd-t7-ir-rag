# Cell unit for observing electrophoresis.

## Abstract
A cell unit for observing an electrophoresis comprising a measurement cell for accomodating a liquid specimen therein a pair of conduit elements for introducing and discharg ing the liquid specimen into and from the measurement cell therethrough, at least one of the conduit elements having a portion made of a flexible tube a pair of valve devices, each valve device being adapted to close a respective one of the pair of conduit elements at least one of the valve devices associated with said at least one of the conduit elements being in the form of a pinch valve adapted to be able to pinch the flexible tube a pair of housing elements for accomodating a pair of electrodes therein, the pair of electrodes being adapted to produce an electric potential gradient in the liquid specimen within the measurement cell a pair of diaphragm elements each being disposed at a position between the measurement cell and a respective one of the pair of housing elements so as to separate a space in the measurement cell from a space in the respective one of the housing elements, at least one of the pair of diaphragm elements being disposed displaceably so as to absorb a fluctuation of a pressure of the liquid specimen in a space defined by the pair of diaphragm elements and valve devices, can securely and easily seal the liquid specimen within the space defined by the pair of diaphragm elements and valve devices, as well as minimize the flow of the liquid specimen within the measurement cell upon sealing.
