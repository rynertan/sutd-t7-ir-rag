# DC permanent magnet motors.

## Abstract
A DC permanent magnet motor includes a pole piece 14 or 16 which has notched leading and trailing edges 32 which present alternately sloping edges 24 to an armature bar 24 passing thereunder whereby to substantially reduce or elimi nate cogging. The edges 34 are preferably substantially straight and the slope of the alternate edges may be the same or different. The length L of each notch measured from the edge of the inner curved surface 35 of the pole piece 14 or 16 in a circumferential direction is preferably equal to the dis tance between the corresponding radially outermost points on adjacent armature bars 24 .
