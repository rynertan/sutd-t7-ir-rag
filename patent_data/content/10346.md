# Polyolefins stabilized against light induced degradation and a light stabilizer composition therefor.

## Abstract
Polyolefins are stabilized against light induced degrada tion by incorporating a combination of n hexadecyl 3,5 di t. butyl 4 hydroxybenzoate and a dialkyl pentaery thrityl dis phosphite. Further improvement is obtained by incorporating a benzotriazole or benzophenone.
