# Method for installing tubes in a tube sheet.

## Abstract
A tube 10 is inserted in a bore 12 in a tube sheet 14 , the tube 10 having an outside diameter slightly smaller than the bore 14 . Hydraulic pressure is applied to the tube 10 internally to expand it radially throughout a pressure zone that extends at least up to one end of the bore 12 . The pressure is confined between two axially spaced seals 28, 30 that encircle a mandrel 20 and are engagable with the inner surface of the tube 10 . The mandrel 20 and seals 28, 30 are then shifted to relocate the pressure zone so that it does not reach the end, and increased pressure is applied to produce a firmer contact between the outside of the tube 10 and the bore 12 . Any crevices between the tube 10 and the tube sheet 14 in which corrosion would be likely to occur are thus eliminated. The invention is particularly suitable for use in connection with the heat exchangers of power plants.
