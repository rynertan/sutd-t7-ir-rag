# Gaskets.

## Abstract
A kit of gaskets comprises at least one piece 10 of gasket forming material, preferably of the dry joint grade, which piece includes gasket parts 1 and packaging parts 2. Cuts 4 separate the gasket parts 1 from the packaging parts 2. The cuts 4 do not extend around the gasket peripheries but terminate so as to define interconnecting regions 6. At least two of the gasket parts may define segments 14, 16 each having a dovetail projection 12 or recess 14 adapted for engagement with one another. The bolt holes are formed by removing the pips of material from the piece.
