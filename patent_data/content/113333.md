# Elastic suspension for rear wheels.

## Abstract
The object of the invention is an elastic suspension for the rear wheels, even driving wheels, of autovehicles, particularly of motorcycles or like vehicles. This suspension comprises two preferably upwardly converging suspension arms 3, 4 which by their upper ends are pivotally connected at two different pivot points 103, 104 to the vehicle frame 1 , and by their lower ends are pivotally connected at two different pivot points 203, 204 to a wheel carrying member 5 , whereby an articulated quadrilateral is formed, which lies in a plane parallel to the rear wheel plane, or to the longitudinal vertical median plane of the vehicle. The rear wheel carrying member 5 has a rearward extension 105 extending outwardly of the articulated quadrilateral, and the rear wheel 2 is mounted onto the said rearward extension 105 .
