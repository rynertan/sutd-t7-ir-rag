# Superconducting logic circuit.

## Abstract
A superconducting logic circuit has a bridge circuit having two superconducting switching devices J1, J2 connected in series between two power source terminals 10, 12 . Two pairs of resistances 14, 16 and 26, 28 are also connected in series between the power source terminals 10, 12 . The junction 20 of the first pair of resistances 14, 16 forms an output terminal whilst the junction 24 of the second pair of resistances 26, 28 form an input terminal. The use of the second pair of resistances 26, 28 enables the circuit to be used as an AND and or OR logic element which does not require complementary input signals.
