# DIE CUT WINDOW LAMINATING DEVICE

## Abstract
The present invention provides a device for forming a moving web of laminated composite material having window portions therein from a moving continuous web of plastic film material and a moving continuous web of paper material. The device comprises a cutter for repeatingly cutting spaced apart perforated window patterns in the paper web and a wetting unit for wetting the film web at spaced apart target areas having shapes substantially identical to the perforated window patterns. The device further comprises a phasing arrangement having both a coarse mode and a fine mode of operation for providing accurate registry of the perforated window patterns and the wetted target areas. A wetting synchronization unit synchronizes the wetting unit with the film target areas whereby the target areas and only the target areas are wetted by the wetting unit. Also provided is a device for removing a paper chad portion from the perforated window patterns subsequent to lamination.
