# PROTECTIVE RESPIRATOR

## Abstract
Respiratory protection means having a cup shaped filter material body 1 , the outer end of which is so executed at its edge as to exhibit an element 2 intended to make contact with the face in such a way that the nose and mouth of the wearer are enclosed within the space formed inside the cup shape. During inhalation the air from the surroundings will be obliged in this way to pass through the filter material body, whereas an exhalation valve 8 can be provided to permit exhalation. The filter material body 1 exhibits at least one strip of filter material pleated in its transverse sense, for example a strip of filter paper, which has been given said cup shape. The element intended to make contact with the face consists of a ring 2 of a material which, by casting or some similar process, has been attached to one of the edge parts of the pleated filter material body so as to form an airtight connection, whereas the opposite edge part of the filter material body has been attached in a similarly airtight fashion to a plate 3 or similar which seals the outer end edge of the filter material body.
