# ZrB2 Composite sintered material.

## Abstract
A ZrB₂ composite sintered material consisting essentially of at least 1 by weight of SiC, at least 1 by weight of B₄C, at most 15 by weight of TiC, at most 35 by weight of TiN, at most 40 by weight of AlN, the rest being substantially ZrB₂, provided that the total amount of SiC and B₄C is from 2 to 50 by weight.
