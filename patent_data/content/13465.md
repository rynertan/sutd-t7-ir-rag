## Description
Staged Froth flotation with Intermediate RecycleThe present invention relates to an improved method fcr carrying out froth flotation separation.A variety of methods for purifying liquids by flotation techniques are well known. Particular applications of f13 tation include removing finely divided solids or organic liquid impurities from water. Flotation methods are also widely used for separating a desired mineral from solid waste materials in suspension in liquids such as water.Flotation purification techniques typically involve forming a froth by mixing air or another gas with water to be purified or with another liquid, usually after addition of a frothing agent or other reagent to aid in froth formation or wetting. The froth formed floats on the surface of the liquid and is easily separated by mechanical means from the liquid. Impurities contained in the water or other liquid adhere selectively to bubbles of air or other gas rising through the liquid. The impurities are floated into the froth layer above the liquid and are separated from the liquid with the froth. Flotation purification of water is used commercially for removing liquid oils from water, as well as for removing various solids.Flotation separation of liquid or particulate solid material from a liquid to be purified is often undertaken in a series of three or more stages or steps. Each step involves first, mixing a gas with the liquid to form a froth which contains a material to be separated from the liquid, ann second, separating the froth from the liquid. After eac stage is finished except the last , the liquid is passe on to a downstream stage, where the froth formation n separation operation is repeated. The number of stages used in any given commercial embodiment of a froth flotation system depends on the difficulty of separating the particular material involved often 4 6 stages are usedOne commercially available flotation system includes f serial stages.Liquid recovered from the last stage is recycled to the first stage, and to the intermediate sec and third stages, and also to the last stage. The recycle previously treated liquid recovered from the last stage effluent is used to mix air with the liquid in each stage by jetting recycled liquid into which gas has been induced into a body of the liquid to be treated. In each stage, the resulting froth or foam is skimmed off the body of liquid. After separation of froth, the liquid is passed t the next stage.The body of liquid being treated in a given stage is maintained substantiaw eparate from the body of liquid in upstream or downstream stages adjacent the given stage by a baffle, which prevents froth fr fr given stage from migrating to upstream or downstrean t.S. Patent 3,647,069 discloses apparatus and a met . performing flotation separation, particularly in the ting of separating solids, such as silica, and petroler liquid materials from water, and also for deaerating wattU.S. Patent 3,864,251 discloses the use of froth flotatic for recovering bitumen from tar sand and water. U.S.Pat 3,884,803 discloses the use of froth flotation to purify water which has been contaminated with a high API grav oil. The Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Second Ed tion. Vol. 9, pages 780 398, includes a discussion of r use of froth flotation for separating minerals, su a metal ores, from waste materials and water. According to the present invention there is provided a method of separating a first liquid from a mixture of said first liquid and a particulate solid or a second liquid insoluble in said first liquid in which the mixture is treated in a series of flotation stages including at laL a first stage and a last stage and in each stage the mixture is treated to form a froth by mixing a gas therewith and the froth removed, and in which a first recycle por tion of the mixture is recovered from the last stage a recycled thereto characterised in that a second recycle portion is recovered from a stage upstream with respect to the last stage and recycled to the first stage, the recycled portions being separately derived.The series of flotation stages may include at least one intermediate stage and the second recycle portion may be recovered from the mixture after froth is separated therefrom in such intermediate stage, such second recycle portion being recycled both to the first stage and to such intermediate stage.The series of flotation stages may include a plurality of intermediate stages, and the second recycle portion may be recovered from the mixture after froth is separated therefrom in one of such intermediate stages, such second recycle portion being recycled both to the first stage and to that one intermediate stage or an intermediate stage upstream with respect to that one intermediate stage. The second recycled portion may be recycled to the first stage, the one intermediate stage from which it is recovered and at least one intermediate stage upstream with respect to the one intermediate stage.Each stage may include at least one flotation zone in which the mixture is treated to form a froth on the mixture by mixing a gas therewith and the froth is removed and the first recycle portion may be recovered from a zone in the last stage and recycled to such zone or a zone in the last stage which is upstream with respect thereto and the secor recycle portion may be recovered from a zone in the first stage and recycled to such zone or a zone in the first stage upstream with respect thereto.Preferably, the first liquid comprises water and thegas used in forming froth in the flotation steps comprises airWe have found that, by recycling a portion of the mixture recovered prior to carrying out the last stage, a substan tidl improvement in the separation efficiency of a given staged flotation separation process can be obtained. The recycle portion of the mixture can be added to the primary stream of the mixture in the system prior to or during the first separation stage or, additionally, prior to or during any intermediate stage at any point upstream of the point in the operation where the recycle portion of the mixture is separated from the primary purification stream of the mixture.Recycle of a portion of the mixture remaining after an intermediate stage is partic i ly advantageouz for use in flotation separation systems L ich frot formed in each stage by jetting a recycled portion c t mixture into which gas has been induced into a body body the cf mixture in each stage of purification. The prese provides a significant improvement over prior art tion systems which employ a purified liquid recovered the last flotation separation step for inducing froth formation in every step of the flotation and separation operation. The improved method of the present invention can be used in conjunction with known systems for staged froth flotation separation of mixtures of a liquid with any type of particulate solid or liquid material which is at leat partly insoluble in the liquid. Representative types ot separation systems in which the present method can advantageously be applied includes separation of hydro carbonaceous liquids such as petroleum fractions fr water, separation of valuable minerals from water and from solid mineral waste, and separation of biosolids from water.Systems must include at least two stages, a first ar a last, in order to permit use of the present inventionsTo permit optimum use of the invention, a flotation separ ation system preferably includes at least three serial stages1 through which a primary stream of a mixture is flowed, in turn, during processing. Thus, a suitable system preferably includes at least a first stage, an intermediate stage, and a last stage. Of course, systems including more than one intermediate stage are also sait able for employment of the invention.In each stage, or step, of such an operation, froth containing material to be separated from a mixture must be formed and the froth and material must be separated from the mixture, before the mixture is passed to a subsequent, downstream stages or is finally removed from the system.The type of gas used to form froth, or foam, in a g sem using the present invention is normally dictated by tie type of materials being separated. Often, air is s itable for use. In some cases, other gases, e.g., nitrogetor methane are more desirable. The choice of a suitable gas for use in any system employing the invention is wi in the ability of those skilled in the art.One embodiment of the invention will now be describ by way of example, reference being made to the accompaEg drawing which schematically illustrates the embodimentReferring to the drawing, a feed mixture containing first liquid and a particulate solid or a second liquid j ro duced into the system through a conduit 1 and is pSEEi into a first flotation zone 2, wherein a first fl ttation step is performed.A frothing agent such as a commerciall available polyelectrolyte is usually added with the feed i a concentration range of 2 to 40 milligrams per litres T the first zone 2, a recycle portion of the mixture, into which gas has been induced, provided in a manner described below, is jetted into a body of the feed mixture to mix ai with the mixture and form a froth relatively rich in the material to be separated from the mixture. The resultin froth floats on the mixture. The froth is separated fro the mixture in a conventionally known manner, such as by skimming, and is removed from the first flotation zone 2 through a conduit 3. Treated mixture is withdrawn from the first zone 2 and is passed through a conduit 4 into an intermediate, second flotation zone 5.It will be readily understood by those skilled in the art that the flotation zones 2 and 5 can be in communication by any type of opening, passage, etc., which will serve to segregate froth generated in the zone 9 from froth generated in the zone 5 and to ensure that a f ture is suffi ciently treated in the zone 2, i.e., that lis residence time is sufficient, prior to being passed into the one 5.SI Th the zones 2 and 5 may comprise chambers simply separa ed by one or more appropriately disposed baffle, with m flowing without impediment from the upstream zone 2 tc downstream zone 5 in a path defined by the baffles. rb path of the mixture from the zone 2 to the zone 5 as depicted in the drawing, using the conduit 4, is shown for the sake of schematic simplicity.In the broad scope of the invention, the manner in which froth is formed in the flotation zones 2 and 5, as well as in the other flotation zones discussed below, is not a critical feature. Preferably, however, froth is formed ir a given zone by jetting a recycle portion of the r r recovered from downstream of the stage into a body o tr mixture in each stage after gas has been induced in t e recycle portion, thus inducing circulation into the body of the mixture of the gas from the freeboard space provided above the body of mixture in each zone.A variety of other suitable means and methods for forming froth in each zone will be apparent to those skilled in the art e.g., the use of gas jets, mechanical mixers, such as i pellers, etc. After froth is formed and separated trom the mixture in the intermediate, second flotation zrre the froth is withdrawn from the zone 5 and is passed through a conduit 6 into admixture with froth in the oenw duit 3. Treated mixture remaining after separation of froth is removed from the zone 5 and is passed into a conduit 7.A recycle portion of the mixture passed into the conduit 7 is removed from the conduit 7 and is contacted with the primary stream of the mixe re upstream of the conduit 7, at least one point upstream of separation of froth from the mixture in the intermediate zone 5. A portion of the effluent mixture from the zone 5 is removed from the conduit 7 through a conduit 8, the amount of the recycle portion removed being regulated in the embodiment shown by 2 valve 9 operatively connected into the conduit 8. The amount of mixture removed from the main body of the mixture in a conduit 7 and recycled through the conduit 8 is generally between about 40 and about 90 volume percent of the total amount of mixture passed into the conduit 7 from the zone 5. Preferably, the amount of mixture passed into the conduit 8 is maintained between about 50 and about 80 volume percent of the amount of mixture withdrawn from the zone 5 into the conduit 7. By removing the recycle portion of the mixture into the conduit 8, mixture is thereby removed from the main mixture stream of the mixture after froth has been separated from the mixture in the intermediate flotation step carried out in the zone 5 and before gas is mixed with the main stream of the mixture in a last flotation step discussed below. The recycle portion of the mixture recovered from the conduit 7 flows through the conduit 8 into the pump 10 and is ejected from the pumb 10 into a conduit 11.One part of the recycle portion of the mixture ejected fro the pump 10 is passed farther through the conduit 11 for recycle into the first flotation zone 2, wherein recycled mixture from the conduit 11 is contacted with the main bod of feed mixture prior to separating froth from the mixture in the first flotation step. Preferably, the recycled porl tion of the mixture introduced into the first zone from thZ conduit 11 is used, after induction of air into the conduit 11, as a jet for mixing air with the liquid in the zone 2 to form froth, as discussed above. The amount of recycled mixture passing into the first zone 2 from the conduit 11 is regulated by a valve 12 operatively connected into the conduit 11.Another part of the recycle portion of mixture ejected from the pump 10 is passed from the conduit 11 through a conduit 13 into the intermediate, second flotation zone 5, wherein recycled mixture from the conduit 13 is coutited with the main body of the mixture prior to separating froth fro mixture in the intermediate, second flotation step PreS ably, the recycled portion of the mixture introduces the intermediate zone 5 from the conduit 13 is used, t induction of air into the conduit 13, as a jet for mixi air with the mixture in the zone 5 to form froth. The amount of recycled mixture passing into the intermediate zone 5 from the conduit 13 is regulated by means of a valve 14 operatively connected into the conduit 11.After being separated from froth in the intermediate, second zone 5, and being withdrawn from the zone 5 into the conduit 7 and having the recycled portion of the mix ture removed therefrom into the conduit 8, the main stream of the mixture in the conduit 7 is passed into another intermediate flotation zone 15. In the intermediate. solid flotation zone 15, the mixture is again mixed with air to form froth. The froth is separated from the mixture, removed from the zone 15 into a conduit 16, and passed into the conduit 3.In the embodiment depicted, a recycle portion of the mixture into which air has been induced, pro vided in a manner described below, is jetted into a dg tl the mixture in the zone 15 to mix air with the mixture F. form a froth which contains material to be separate T the mixture. After froth is separated and removed, . mixture is withdrawn from the intermediate, third zone 15 and is passed through a conduit 17 into a last, fourth flo tation zone 18. In the last zone 18, the mixture is again mixed with gas to form froth which contains material to be separated from the mixture. The froth is then separated from the mixture and is removed from the last flotation zone 18 through a conduit 59into the conduit 3. Broth in the conduit 3 may then be removed from the flotation system and treated in a conventional manner. After separation from froth, the mixture is withdrawn from the last flotation zone 18 and passed through a conduit 20 into a pump 21. The mixture is ejected from the pump 21 into a conduit 22.A portion of the mixture in the conduit 22 is removed therefrom and passed into a conduit 23 for recycle to the flotation zones 15 and 18. The amount of the mixture passed ing into the conduit 23 is regulated by means of a valve 24 operatively connected into the conduit 23. A first part of the portion of the mixture in the conduit 23 is passed into the third flotation zone 15. The amount of the mixture recycled to the zone 15 is regulated by a valve 25 on the conduit 23. A second part of the portion of the mixture in the conduit 23 is removed and passed through a conduit 26 into the fourth and last flotation zone 18. The amount of mixture recycled to the zone 18 is controlled by means of a valve 27 operatively connected into the conduit 26. The main stream of the treated mixture is removed from the system through the conduit 22. rite following illustrative embodiment shows a specific preferred embodiment of the invention.
