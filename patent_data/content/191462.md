# Purification of aziridine 2 carboxylic acid salts.

## Abstract
Alkaline earth metal salts of aziridine 2 carboxylic acid, typically Ca salt, are produced by a reaction of a 2,3 diha lopropionic acid derivative or an α haloacrylic acid deriva tive with an aqueous ammonia in the presence of an alka line earth metal hydroxide, typically Ca OH ₂. Salts of aziridine 2 carboxylic acid are recovered from such a reaction product as referred to above by a liquid chromatographic technique in which a weak or weakened cation exchanger is utilized.
