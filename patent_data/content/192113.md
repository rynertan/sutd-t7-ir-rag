## Description
Field of the Invention The present invention relates to cationic electrodeposition compositions for deposition over rough steel. Brief Description of the Prior Art Electrodeposition as a coating application method involves deposition of a film forming composition under the influence of an applied electrical potential. Electrodeposition has become increasingly important in the coatings industry because by comparison with non electrophoretic coating means, electrodeposition offers higher paint utilization, outstanding corrosion protection and low environmental contamination. Initially, electrodeposition was conducted with the workpiece being coated serving as the anode. This was familiarly referred to as anionic electrodeposition. However, in 1972, cationic electrodeposition was introduced commercially. Since that time, cationic electrodeposition has steadily gained in popularity and today is by far the most prevalent method of electrodeposition. Throughout the world, more than 80 percent of all motor vehicles produced are given a primer coating by cationic electrodeposition. One disadvantage associated with conventional cationic electrodeposition compositions is that they do not form smooth cured coatings over rough steel substrates. They usually deposit as thin films, that is, from about 10 to 20 µm, which, after curing, do not mask the surface roughness of the underlying steel. Recently, cationic electrodeposition copositions have been developed which deposit as relatively thick films, that is, from 25 to 50 µm. Typical of these compositions are those which contain blocked isocyanate curing agents and which are available from PPG Industries, Inc. under the trademark UNI PRIME. These coating compositions have been enthusiastically received by the automotive industry because they can be deposited on smooth steel substrates and topcoated without the need for primer surfacer. The resultant composite coatings have excellent appearance and chip resistance over smooth steel. However, these coating compositions are also not completely satisfactory for primer use over rough steel substrates which are often used in automobile manufacturing. Although providing for good chip resistance, the resultant cured coating is surprisingly rough and this surface roughness causes the topcoat to reflect images in a blurry fashion which is not acceptable for automotive applications. An application of an intermediate coating primer surfacer often sanded is required to provide a smooth enough surface for passenger cars with acceptable topcoat appearance. The cause or this surface roughness was at first not understood because when the thicker film build compositions were initially deposited, they completely filled the surface irregularities of the rough steel substrate. The uncured coatings appeared very smooth. However, upon curing, the coating became very rough. Although not intending to be bound by any theory, it is believed that the primer coat which contains blocked isocyanate curing agents shrinks during cure. A principal cause of the shrinking was believed to be due to the loss of blocking agent, i.e., relatively high molecular weight alcohols such as 2 ethylhexanol and 2 hexoxyethanol. It was found that after dehydration and removal of organic solvent, the uncured film would lose about 15 20 percent of its weight upon final curing. Since the film was crosslinking, no or very little dimensional relaxation occurred to compensate for the weight loss and a high volume shrinkage resulted. GB A 1,538,970 corresponding to FR A 2,347,420 discloses a cationic electrodeposition coating composition which provides coating films having uniform effective thickness of 20 to 25 µm without using large quantities of the water soluble organic solvent. The coating composition comprises a water soluble addition polymer having an average molecular weight of 500 to 10,000 and a resin which is a reaction product of a partially blocked polyisocyanate with another specific reaction product of an adduct of an epoxy resin. The composition may further contain a pigment. The ratio of pigment to resin disclosed is 0.7 1. GB A 1,538,970 does not refer to the coating of rough steel and the problems associated therewith. GB A 2,038,336 corresponding to FR A 2,445,354 refers to a cationic electrodepositable resin composition having improved corrosion resistance and throwing power. The resin composition comprises as a film forming ingredient the reaction product of a an epoxy resin, b an amino terminated condensation product of a maleinized fatty acid and a polyamine, and c a partially blocked polyisocyanate compound. The epoxy resin has a very low molecular weight of from 150 to 6000. The molecular weights of component b and the final resin comprising the blocked polyisocyanate functionality are not disclosed. GB A 2,033,336 is silent with regard to the problem of rough steel and the smoothness of the coating composition applied thereon. GB A 2,051,072 corresponding to FR A 2,452,514 discloses a resin composition for use in the cationic electrodeposition of coating compositions which have high throwing power and do not foul top coated films nor deteriorate the properties of the top coated films. The resin composition comprises a mixture or reaction product of a basic polyamino resin and specific low volatile polyisocyanates which are a mixture of partially blocked aromtic polyisocyanates and fully blocked aromatic polyisocyanates. The molecular weight of the resin is less than 5000. GB A 2,051,072 does not relate to the preparation of coating compositions with a controlled flow out behaviour to allow application on rough steel. Reference EP A 36471 refers to an aqueous electrodeposition coating which avoids non uniform coatings on differently treated substrates and on horizontal and vertical substrates. The composition contains a protonated amino group containing cationic resin, a dispersed particulate organic non ionic polymer and a blocked polyisocyanate. It is taught that the use of high amounts of organic pigments, if desired in combination with anorganic pigments, controlls the flow out behaviour of thick coatings during baking. It is the object of the present invention to provide an electrocoating composition with is capable of providing a smooth coating over rough steel substrates. The object is achieved by an electrodepositable aqueous coating composition comprising a cationic resin and a blocked polyisocyanate crosslinker as the film forming binder and pigment, dispersed in water characterized in that The electrocoating composition comprises a cationic resin containing blocked isocyanate functionality characterized such that when electrodeposited over rough steel and heated to maximum flow, the incompletely cured coating has a profile of less than 0.160 µm, and upon heating to complete cure, the percentage cured film weight loss expressed as a percentage of the film weight is less than 10, and the product of the incompletely cured film profile and the square of the percentage cured film weight loss is less than 7.5. The invention also provides for a method of cationic electrodeposition using the above described compositions and for the resultantly electrocoated articles. The present invention is unobvious because prior to the present invention, the automotive industry could not produce a smooth cathodically electrodeposited primer over rough steel. Also, the relationships between weight loss, flow and shrinkage which are necessary to anticipate such an invention were unknown. It was believed that a primer surfacer had to be applied to the electrodeposited primer and sanded to provide a smooth underlying coating for the subsequently applied topcoat. However, in accordance with the present invention, it has been found by controlling the flow out properties of the electrodeposition coating and the weight loss of the coating after it has reached its point of maximum flow before significant crosslinking, extremely smooth cured electrodeposited coatings can be obtained which approximate the smoothness of the coating with a sanded primer surfacer. The coating compositions of the present invention are formulated to provide smooth electrodeposited coatings over rough steel. When the electrodeposited coating is cured, it is believed two key processes, flow out and shrinkage, occur that control the final smoothness of the cured coating. As the coated article enters the curing oven, the temperature of the coating is increased. This lowers the coating viscosity and it begins to flow and level out. Further into the curing cycle, the ability to flow reaches a maximum and then decreases as solvent evaporates and crosslinking or curing takes place. By the time crosslinking reaches a point where the coating develops solvent resistance, the coating has effectively no ability to flow. The final stages of cure produce more crosslinking which is accompanied by further loss of materials from the film such as blocking agents. Since the coating cannot flow or relax to compensate for this loss of material, it shrinks. As it shrinks, it begins to take the shape of the substrate under it. When the substrate is rough, high levels of shrinkage result in an inability of the coating to provide a smooth surface. Also, if the coating composition does not initially flow out to form a smooth surface before crosslinking begins, the final cured coating will be rough even though shrinkage may be minimal during the final stages of cure. It is believed that certain factors affect the flow and shrinkage properties of an electrocoating composition. Although not intending to be limited by specific limits, it is believed the most important factors are the molecular weight of the principal electrocoating vehicle, the type of pigment grinding vehicle and the crosslinker used, the pigment to binder weight ratio, the type of pigment used, the presence of a non volatile plasticizer in the coating composition, and in the case of blocked isocyanate curing agents, the identity of the isocyanate and the molecular weight of its blocking agent. Two convenient tests have been developed to determine whether the electrocoating compositions are within the scope of this invention. These tests are determined over rough steel. As mentioned above, the coating composition must be of the high flow type, that is, during the early stages of the curing cycle, the electrodeposition coating must coalesce and form a smooth uncured film over the rough steel substrate. The flow of the coating composition is measured quite easily. The coating composition is first cathodically electrodeposited over a rough steel substrate i.e., profile from 1.52 to 1.78 µm 60 70 microinches as determined with a profilometer as discussed below in a conventional manner and is then heated at a temperature and for a time sufficient to dehydrate the coating composition, remove volatile solvents and produce the maximum flow, but insufficient to cure the coating, that is, to obtain solvent resistance, e.g., 20 acetone double rubs. Such time and temperature conditions would be, for example, those used to get a percentage solids or non volatile content on the coating compositions which are well known in the industry. Typical times and temperatures are shown in the Examples. Heating the film under these conditions is representative of the beginning portions in the curing cycle when the coating flows or coalesces to its greatest extent prior to the coating crosslinking during the latter stages of the curing cycle when flow is restricted. After the uncured film is treated as described above, the surface profile is measured with a profilometer and is taken as a measure of the flowability of the coating. The lower the value is, the smoother is the coating, and the greater is the flow. The temperature for determining the flowability is that required to achieve maximum flow and can be determined experimentally by simply measuring surface profile as a function of temperature at constant time. It has been found that coating compositions of the present invention preferably have profiles of less than 0.160, more preferably less than 0.080 µm. The surface profile of both the uncured coating and the rough steel is measured with a profilometer using a moving stylus method. A direct coupled probe Clevite Corp., now Federal Products, Inc., model 21 3100 00 , consisting of a 0.000254 cm 0.0001 inch diameter stylus and associated pre amplification, provides an electrical output proportional to the vertical displacement of the stylus. The probe is moved horizontally at a fixed rate of 0.0254 cm 0.01 inch second by a mechanical driver Surfanalyzer 150 Drive, Clevite Corp., model 21 1410 01 . The resulting electrical signal is amplified by a control unit Surfanalyzer control, Clevite Corp., model 21 1330 20 and this analogue signal is then converted to digital input to a microcomputer Hewlett Packard Series 200, Model 16 by an analogue to digital converter Nelson Analytical Inc., model 762 . Conversions were made every 0.050 seconds, thus, each data point represents a horizontal displacement of 0.00127 cm 0.0005 inch . This digital signal is processed to yield a height relative to the mean surface, which is then analyzed. Calibration of the electronic and data acquisition system was verified using a standard roughness sample Gould, Inc. model 21 9010 01 calibrated using NBS Test No. 222.22 186309 of 12 20 65. There was some concern in measuring the surface profile of the uncured coatings that the moving stylus might distort the uncured film and give an inaccurate reading. However, experiments have verified that the stylus pressure was not changing film profile before cure. Uncured coatings over rough steel were measured and then kept in the refrigerator at 2 C 36 F. for about 16 hours. The coatings were retested directly on removal from the cold. The surface profile values were within experimental error of those initially measured values. Thus, the force exerted by the stylus about 200 mg on the uncured coating surface does not affect profile measurements. If there is some doubt that the force of the stylus might be distorting the uncured coating, the coating can be refrigerated as described above before measuring. Besides being highly flowable, the coating composition must also not undergo substantial weight loss during the latter stages of the curing cycle. It is during this time when the film is crosslinking that weight loss results in film shrinkage and consequent roughness over a rough substrate. Weight loss during the initial stages of the curing cycle are not as critical to surface profile since the coating is not crosslinking and can flow out to relieve the stresses brought about by the weight loss. The weight loss of the coating during the latter stages of cure when the film is crosslinking can readily be determined. First, the coating is heated to determine its flowability as described above. The weight of the film after this treatment is recorded W₁ . The coating is then further heated to complete the cure, i.e., standard curing conditions recommended by the coatings supplier, typically at conditions sufficient to develop at lease 50 acetone double rubs. The loss in weight or the film during the completion of the cure is recorded W₂ . The value W₂ W₁ x 100 is the percentage weight loss of the coating during crosslinking and is hereby referred to as the percentage cured film weight loss. The percentage should be less than 10, preferably less than 9, and most preferably less than 8. It has been found that the cured film weight loss is more important in the determination of the final smoothness of the cured coating than the flowability of the coating. For acceptable coatings, it has been found that the product of the profile of the uncured coating and the square of the percentage cured film weight loss has to be less than 7.5, preferably less than 7.0 and more preferably less than 6.5. For the purposes of this invention, the absolute value of the profile with no units is used. The percentage cured film weight loss for this calculation is the number itself, i.e., 8.4 percent 8.4. The product is also expressed as a unitless number. Coating compositions of the present invention give smooth cured coatings over rough steel. This smoothness can be determined directly by a profilometer. However, an even more sensitive measurement of the smoothness of the cured electrodeposited film is to top coat it with a glossy automotive quality topcoat, i.e., 20 gloss of at least 80, and measure the distinctness of image DOI of the cured topcoat. The distinctness of image is the sharpness with which the cured topcoat reflects images. Topcoats which reflect images in a blurry fashion have a low DOI, whereas coatings which are more mirror like in appearance have high DOI. It has been found chat the DOI is directly related to the roughness of the electrodeposition coating. The rougher the coating, the lower the DOI. Coating compositions of the present invention preferably provide for DOI s of at least 80 with black NAD enamels such as described in the Examples. The DOI can be measured with a Dori Gen Meter D47 6 manufactured by Hunter Laboratories. Besides the roughness of the electrodeposition primer, the DOI will also be a function of the topcoat, and how it is applied, i.e., spraying conditions. Since the DOI is a function of spraying conditions, a more meaningful measure of the DOI is the difference of the DOI of the topcoated primer being evaluated versus a standard or control which is topcoated under the same conditions as the primer being evaluated. This can be accomplished by placing the electrocoated panel being evaluated and a standard electrocoated panel in the same spray rack and topcoating them at the same time with the same topcoat composition. The standard electrocoated panel would be prepared from a rough steel panel having the same roughness as the electrocoated rough steel panel being evaluated. The electrodeposition coating on the control panel would be at the same thickness as the primer being evaluated, i.e, about 30 microns. A primer surfacer is applied to the standard electrocoated panel and sanded smooth. Typical compositions and coating conditions for preparing the standard test panel are described in the Examples. As mentioned above, both the standard and the electrocoated panels being evaluated are topcoated under the same conditions as described above. The difference in DOI s between the two is a measure of the smoothness of the electrodeposition coating being evaluated. The closer the DOI s, the smoother the electrodeposition coating. The coating composition of the present invention preferably provides for DOI differences DOI of standard minus DOI of invention of less than 10, more preferably less than 8, and most preferably less than 7 units. The resinous ingredients of the coating compositions of the present invention comprise as essential ingredients the resinous film forming binder which comprises the cationic resin and crosslinking agent. The cationic resins have amine salt groups or quaternary ammonium salt groups, which are the acid solubilized reaction products of polyepoxides and primary amines, secondary amines, tertiary amines and mixtures thereof. These cationic resins are present in combination with the specific blocked polyisocyanate curing agents. The polyisocyanate can be present as a fully blocked polyisocyanate or the polyisocyanate can be partially blocked and reacted into the amine salt polymer backbone. The polyepoxides which are used in the practice of the invention are polymers having a 1,2 epoxy equivalency greater than one and preferably about two, that is, polyepoxides which have on an average basis two epoxy groups per molecule. The preferred polyepoxides are polyglycidyl ethers of cyclic polyols. Particularly preferred are polyglycidyl ethers of polyhydric phenols such as bisphenol A. These polyepoxides can be produced by etherification of polyhydric phenols with epihalohydrin or dihalohydrin such as epichlorohydrin or dichlorohydrin in the presence of alkali. Examples of polyhydric phenols are 2,2 bis 4 hydroxypnenyl propane, 1,1 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl ethane, 2 methyl 1,1 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane, 2,2 bis 4 hydroxy 3 tertiarybutylphenyl propane, bis 2 hydroxynaphthyl methane, 1,5 dihydroxy 3 naphthalene or the like. Besides polyhydric phenols, other cyclic polyols can be used in preparing the polyglycidyl ethers of cyclic polyol derivatives. Examples of other cyclic polyols would be alicyclic polyols, particularly cycloaliphatic polyols, such as 1,2 cyclohexanediol, 1,4 cyclohexanediol, 1,2 bis hydroxymethyl cyclohexane, 1,3 bis hydroxymethyl cyclohexane and hydrogenated bisphenol A. The polyepoxides have molecular weights of at least 200 and preferably within the range of 200 to 2000, and more preferably about 340 to 2000. The polyepoxides are preferably chain extended with a polyether or a polyester polyol which increases rupture voltage of the composition and enhances flow and coalescence. Examples of polyether polyols and conditions for chain extension are disclosed in U S A 4,468,307, column 2, line 67, to column 4, line 52. Examples of polyester polyols for chain extension are disclosed in U S A 4,148,772, column 4, line 42, to column 5, line 53. The polyepoxide is reacted with a cationic group former, for example, an amine and acid. The amine can be a primary, secondary or tertiary amine and mixtures thereof. The preferred amines are monoamines, particularly hydroxyl containing amines. Although monoamines are preferred, polyamines such as ethylene diamine, diethylene triamine, triethylene tetraamine, N 2 aminoethyl ethanolamine and piperizine can be used but their use in large amounts is not preferred because they are multifunctional and have a greater tendency to gel the reaction mixture than monoamines. Tertiary and secondary amines are preferred to primary amines because the primary amines are polyfunctional with regard to reaction to epoxy groups and have a greater tendency to gel the reaction mixture. When using polyamines or primary amines, special precautions should be taken to avoid gelation. For example, excess amine can be used and the excess can be vacuum stripped at the completion of the reaction. Also, the polyepoxide resin can be added to the amine to insure that excess amine will be present. Examples of hydroxyl containing amines are alkanolamines, dialkanolamines, trialkanolamines, alkylalkanolamines, arylalkanolamines and arylalkylalkanolamines containing from 2 to 18 carbon atoms in the alkanol, alkyl and aryl chains. Specific examples include ethanolamine, N methylethanolamine, diethanolamine, N phenylethanolamine, N,N dimethylethanolamine, N methyldiethanolamine and triethanolamine. Amines which do not contain hydroxyl groups such as mono, di and tri alkyl amines and mixed alkyl aryl amines and substituted amines in which the substituents are other than hydroxyl and in which the substituents do not detrimentally affect the epoxy amine reaction can also be used. Specific examples of these amines are ethylamine, propylamine, methylethylamine, diethylamine, N,N dimethylcyclohexylamine, triethylamine, N benzyldimethylamine, dimethylcocoamine and dimethyltallowamine. Also, amines such as hydrazine and propylene imine can be used. Ammonia can also be used and is considered for the purposes of this application to be an amine. Mixtures of the various amines described above can be used. The reaction of the primary and or secondary amine with the polyepoxide resin takes place upon mixing the amine with the product. The reaction can be conducted neat, or, optionally in the presence of suitable solvent. Reaction may be exothermic and cooling may be desired. However, heating to a moderate temperature, that is, within the range of 50 to 150 C., may be used to hasten the reaction. The reaction product of the primary or secondary amine with the polyepoxide resin attains its cationic character by at least partial neutralization with acid. Examples of suitable acids include organic and inorganic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, lactic acid phosphoric acid and carbonic acid. The extent of neutralization will depend upon the particular product involved. It is only necessary that sufficient acid be used to disperse the product in water. Typically, the amount of acid used will be sufficient to provide at least 30 percent of the total theoretical neutralization. Excess acid beyond that required for 100 percent total theoretical neutralization can also be used. In the reaction of the tertiary amine with the polyepoxide resin, the tertiary amine can be prereacted with the acid such as those mentioned above to form the amine salt and the salt reacted with the polyepoxide to form the quaternary ammonium salt group containing resin. The reaction is conducted by mixing the amine salt and the polyepoxide resin together in the presence of water. Typically, the water is employed on the basis of 1.75 to 20 percent by weight based on total reaction mixture solids. Alternately, the tertiary amine can be reacted with the polyepoxide resin in the presence of water to form a quaternary ammonium hydroxide group containing polymer which, if desired, may be subsequently acidified. The quaternary ammonium hydroxide containing polymers can also be used without acid, although their use is not preferred. In forming the quaternary ammonium base group containing polymers, the reaction temperature can be varied between the lowest temperature at which reaction reasonably proceeds, for example, room temperature, or in the usual case, slightly above room temperature, to a maximum temperature of 100 C. at atmospheric pressure . At greater than atmospheric pressure, higher reaction temperatures can be used. Preferably, the reaction temperature ranges between 60 to 100 C. Solvent For the reaction is usually not necessary, although a solvent such as a sterically hindered ester, ether or sterically hindered ketone may be used if desired. In addition to the primary, secondary and tertiary amines disclosed above, a portion of the amine which is reacted with the polyepoxide polyether polyol product can be the ketimine of a polyamine. This is described in U S A 4,104,147 in column 6, line 23, to column 7, line 23. The ketimine groups will decompose upon dispersing the amine epoxy reaction product in water resulting in free primary amine groups which would be reactive with curing agents which are described in more detail below. The extent of cationic group formation of the resin should be selected that when the resin is mixed with aqueous medium, a stable dispersion will form. A stable dispersion is one which does not settle or is one which is easily redispersible if some sedimentation occurs. In addition, the dispersion should be of sufficient cationic character that the dispersed resin particles will migrate towards the cathode when an electrical potential is impressed between an anode and a cathode immersed in the aqueous dispersion. The cationic resins of the invention contain from 0.1 to 3.0, preferably from 0.3 to 1.0 milliequivalents of cationic group per gram of resin solids. The cationic resinous binders have weight average molecular weights, as determined by gel permeation chromatography using a polystyrene standard, of less than 100,000, preferably less than 75,000 and more preferably less than 50,000 in order to achieve high flowability. Blocked isocyanates which are employed in the coating compositions of the invention are organic polyisocyanates and can be those in which the isocyanato groups have been reacted with a compound so that the resultant blocked or capped isocyanate is stable to active hydrogens at room temperature but reactive with active hydrogens at elevated temperatures, usually between 90 and 200 C. The polyisocyanates which are used are mixtures containing diphenylmethane 4,4 diisocyanate and polymethylene polyphenylisocyanate. A mixture containing diphenylmethane 4,4 diisocyanate and polymethylene polyphenylisocyanate is used because it provides better flow and reduced crystallinity with the preferred low molecular weight blocking agents methanol and ethanol described below. One of the preferred polyisocyanate mixtures is available from Mobay Chemical Co. as MONDUR MR. The blocking agent for the polyisocyanate is one which does not contribute substantially to weight loss when the film is heated to cure. Such materials are those which, although they volatilize from the film on cure, have an average molecular weight of 76 or less and would include alcohols such as methanol, ethanol and propanol and mixtures thereof. By average molecular weight is meant the sum of the molecular weights of the blocking agents multiplied by their respective percentage by weight. Thus, a blocking agent having a molecular weight greater than 76 could be used with a blocking agent having a molecular weight less than 76 as long as the weighted average were below 76. Preferred are mixtures of methanol and ethanol. Blocking agents which have average molecular weights greater than 76 result in excessive weight loss on curing leading to film shrinkage and a rough appearance over a rough steel substrate. As mentioned above, the blocked polyisocyanate can be used in two similar ways. The polyisocyanate can be fully blocked, that is, no free isocyanate groups remain and then added to the cationic polymer to form a two component resin. Or, the polyisocyanate can be partially blocked, for example, half blocked diisocyanate, so that there is one remaining reactive isocyanate group. The half blocked isocyanate can then be reacted with active hydrogen groups in the polymer backbone under conditions which will not unblock the blocked isocyanate group. This reaction makes the isocyanate part of the polymer molecule and a one component resin. Whether fully blocked or partially blocked, sufficient polyisocyanate is present with the cationic polymer so that there are about 0.1 to about 1.2 isocyanate groups for each active hydrogen, i.e., hydroxyl, primary and secondary amino and thiol. Preferably, the molecular weight weight average as determined by gel permeation chromatography using a polystyrene standard is less than 15,000, more preferably Less than 5000 in order to achieve high flowability. The cationic resin and the blocked polyisocyanate are the principal resinous ingredients in the electrocoating compositions. They are usually present in amounts of 50 to 100 percent by weight of resin solids. Preferably, the electodepositable coating compositions of the present invention are of the high film build type, that is, they are capable of being electrodeposited and cured as a substantially continuous thick film. High film build compositions as described below are preferred because they are highly flowable. By thick is meant a film having a dry film thickness of at least 25 and usually from 25 to 75 µm. Preferably, the film will have a thickness of at least 30 and more preferably of at lease 35 µm. Besides the resinous ingredients described above, the electrocoating compositions contain a pigment which is incorporated into the composition in the form of a paste. The pigment paste is prepared by grinding or dispersing a pigment into a grinding vehicle and optional ingredients such as wetting agents, surfactants and defoamers. Grinding is usually accomplished by the use of ball mills, Cowles dissolvers, continuous attritors and the like until the pigment has been reduced to the desired size and has been wet by and dispersed by the grinding vehicle. After grinding, the particle size of the pigment should be as small as practical, generally, a Hegman grinding gauge of 6 to 8 is usually employed. The pigment grinding vehicles are those described in EP A 0107098, 0107089 and 0107088 with that of EP A 0107098 being preferred. Those are Pigments which can be employed in the practice of the invention include titanium dioxide, basic lead silicate, carbon black, strontium chromate, iron oxide, clay and phthalocyanine blue. Pigments with high surface areas and oil absorbencies should be used judiciously because they can have an undesirable effect on coalescence and flow. The pigment to resin weight ratio is also fairly important and is less than 0.5 1, preferably less than 0.4 1, and usually 0.2 to 0.4 1. Higher pigment to resin solids weight ratios have also been found to adversely affect coalescence and flow. The coating compositions of the invention can contain optional ingredients such as plasticizers, surfactants, wetting agents, defoamers and anti cratering agents. Examples of surfactants and wetting agents include alkyl imidazolines such as those available from Geigy Industrial Chemicals as GEIGY AMINE C, acetylenic alcohols available from Air Products and Chemicals as SURFYNOL . Examples of defoamers are FOAM KILL 63, a hydrocarbon oil containing inert diatomaceous earth. Examples of anti cratering agents are polyoxyalkylene polyamine reaction products such as those described in U S A 4,432,850. These optional ingredients, when present, constitute from 0 to 30 percent by weight of resin solids. Plasticizers are preferred optional ingredients because they promote flow. Examples are high boiling water immiscible materials such as mixed ethylene propylene oxide adducts of nonyl phenols and bisphenol A. When plasticizers are used, they are used in amounts of about 5 to 15 percent by weight resin solids. Curing catalysts such as tin catalysts are usually present in the composition. Examples are dibutyltin dilaurate and dibutyltin oxide. When used, they are typically present in amounts of 0.05 to 1 percent by weight tin based on weight of total resin solids. The electodepositable coating compositions or the present invention are dispersed in aqueous medium. The term dispersion as used within the context of the present invention is believed to be a two phase translucent or opaque aqueous resinous system in which the resin is in the dispersed phase and water the continuous phase. The average particle size diameter of the resinous phase is 0.1 to 10, preferably less than 5 µm. The concentration of the resinous products in the aqueous medium is, in general, not critical, but ordinarily the major portion of the aqueous dispersion is water. The aqueous dispersion usually contains from 3 to 75, typically 5 to 50 percent by weight resin solids. Aqueous resin concentrates which are to be further diluted with water at the job site generally range from 30 to 75 percent by weight resin solids. Fully diluted electrodeposition baths generally have resin solids contents of 3 to 25 percent by weight. Besides water, the aqueous medium may also contain a coalescing solvent. Useful coalescing solvents include hydrocarbons, alcohols, esters, ethers and ketones. The preferred coalescing solvents include alcohols, polyols and ketones. Specific coalescing solvents include 2 propanol, butanol, 2 ethylhexanol, isophorone, 4 methoxy 2 pentanone, ethylene and propylene glycol and the monoethyl, monobutyl, monohexyl and 2 ethylhexyl ethers of ethylene glycol. The amount of coalescing solvent is not unduly critical and is generally between 0 to 15 percent by weight, preferably 0.5 to 5 percent by weight based on total weight of the aqueous medium. In the process of electrodeposition employing the electrodepositable coating compositions, the aqueous composition is placed in contact with an electrically conductive anode and an electrically conductive cathode. Upon passage of the electric current between the anode and the cathode while in contact with the aqueous coating compositions described above, an adherent film of the coating composition will deposit in a substantially continuous manner on the cathode. The conditions under which electrodeposition is carried out are well known in the art. Electrodeposition is usually carried out at constant voltage. The applied voltage may vary greatly and can be, for example, as low as one volt or as high as several thousand volts, although typically between 50 volts and 500 volts are employed. Current density is usually between 10.8 161.5 amperes per square meter 1.0 ampere and 15 amperes per square foot and tends to decrease quickly during electrodeposition indicating the formation of a continuous self insulating film. Any electroconductive substrate especially metal such as steel, zinc, aluminum, copper, magnesium, or the like can be electrodeposited with the coating compositions of the present invention. However, the invention is particularly desirable for the coating of rough substrates such as untreated, and pretreated rough steel and rough galvanized steel.

The topcoat is applied by automatic spraying and is cured by flashing at ambient conditions for 15 minutes followed by heating for 30 minutes at 127 C 250 F to produce a coating having a dry film thickness of about 37.5 µm. The DOI of the topcoat is measured with a Dori Gen Meter D47 6 manufactured by Hunter Laboratories. The DOI of the standard is determined by electrodepositing and curing a coating composition as set forth in Example 8, The primer surfacer is available from PPG Industries, Inc. as E 5584.
