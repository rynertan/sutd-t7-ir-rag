# Electronic musical instrument.

## Abstract
An electronic musical instrument comprises a keyboard 1 for producing key information, a control circuit 2 for receiving the key information, and a sound generating circuit 3 controlled by the control circuit. A set switch 5 causes the keyboard to produce semitone transfer information to the control circuit and the memory 7 stores the semitone transfer information under the control of the control circuit. The control circuit is arranged to modify the key information in dependence upon the semitone transfer information stored in the memory.
