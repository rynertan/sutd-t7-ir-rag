## Description
Title of the Invention Connecting Structure for two MembersBackground of the Invention Field of the Invention This invention relates to a structure of connecting two members, and more particularly to a structure of connecting two members which is suitable for use in connecting a preferably cylindrical member and a preferably surface contact member to each other with a butt joint, Prior Art of the Invention Butting a cylindrical member against a fiat member and then plastically deforming some metal interposed therebetween to connect these members together is also ko, it is disclosed in Japanese Patent Land open No. 150, 6i 1979. According to this prior art, an annular groove of a width greater than the wall thickness of the cylindrical member is formed in the butting surface of the fiat eer, and annul r connection grooves are formed in the inner circumferential surface of the groove in the flat member and the outer circumferential surface of the joint portion of the cylindrical member A metal piece which has a deformation resistance lower tan those of the materials of the two members being connected together is inserted into the connection grooves, and local deformation pressure is applied thereto in the vertical direction to plastically deform the metal piece and thereby combine the two members.This kind of method increases the strength with which the members are sealed together, so that a comparatively good effect can be obtained easily when attaching a base cover, etc. However, the use of a support block holding the outer circumferential surface of the base cover is necessary, but this is inconvenient in that it reduces productivity, so this structure is not suitable for connecting a cylindrical part perpendicularly to another member. Summary of the Invention Object of the Invention An object of the present invention is to provide a structure of connecting two members which enables the economy of materials to be used and the inproet of the gastightness between members. Another object of the present invention is to provide a structure of connecting two members which enables the easy and reliable connection of a cylindrical member per pendicularly to a flat or cylindrical member. Feature of the Invention The present invention is characterized in that a first member is fitted into a recess formed in a surface of a second member which is placed opposite one end of said first member, at least one annular groove is formed on a surface of either of said first member or said second member, and a portion of said first member or said second member is plastically deformed into said at least one annular groove by pressing locally in the axial direction the connecting portion of said first and second members, whereby said first and second members are connected together by the binding force generated in that the section of said one of said members surrounding said grooved portion.Brief Description of the Drawings The accompanying drawings show embodiments of the present invention, wherein Fig. 1 is 2 partially cutaway view of a flat plate and a bottomed cylindrical part connected together Fig. 2A is a section through the parts of Fig. 1, illustrating the method of their connection Fig. 2B is an enlarged view of a principal portion ofFig. 2A Fig. 3 is a partially cutaway view of a bottomed cylindrical part used in another embodiment of the present invention Fig. 4 is a parLially cuta y view of parts connected by a third embodiment of the part connectIon method of the present invention Fig. 5 is a section through a crankshaft to which the present invention is applied Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment Figs. 1 and 2 show an embodiment of the structure of connecting two members according to the present invention, by which a bottomed cylindrical part and a flat part are connected together with a butt joint. Referring to the drawings, a first cylindrical part 1 is provided with a bottom 1A and is formed in the shape of a cup by, for example, cold pressing an iron blank. The first member 1 is provided with at least one continuous groove 1B annularly around the outer circumferential surface of an end portion thereof. The bottom of the groove is provided with a plurality of continuous bumps and indentations 1C and the grooves are preferably formed to be positioned in the portion of the outer circumferential surface of the part 1 which is between the upper and lower surfaces of the bottom 1R thereof.The bumps anc inaentations 1C are formed by making annular grooves of a W shaped cross section of an angle of incidence of about 303 in that portion of the first member 1, and then knurling the crest of the ridse√ßdefined by the grooves.A second member 2 is made of an aluminum material with a deformation resistance of 8 10 kg mm2 or a copper material, for example, the deformation resistance of which is less than that of the first member 1 which has a deformation resistance of 40 60 kg mm2 . A recess 2A of a diameter dl with a fitting tolerance of 1 100 5 100 mm , substantially equal to the outer diameter Dl of the first part 1, is provided in an end surface of the second member 2. The two members of this structure are connected together in the following manner. The bottom 1A of the first member 1 is first fitted into the recess 2A in the second member 2, as shown in Fig. 2 A . When the members 1, 2 are arranged In this way the annular grooves 1B face an inner circumferential surface 2B of the recess 2A, so that the outer cIrcumferential portion of the joint portion of the first member 1 is surrounded and held by the second member 2. A cylindrical metal mold 3, which is moved down by a press not shown , is then slid down. over the outer circum ferentlal surface of the fIrst part 1 so that a rale tooth 3A thereof presses into the upper surface of the second member 2 in the vicinity of the inner crcumference thereof, as shown in Fig. 2 B . Consequently, the second member 2, made of a softer material, f lows plastically into the spaces formed by the grooves 1B. In other words, the b s provided on the harder member such as the first member eat into the softer member such as the second member, so that the softer member is deformed plastically and locally by the bumps, and is connected with the harder member with a large binding force, because of the elastic stresses generated in the softer member. The metal mold 3 is then removed to complete the operation.As shown in Fig. 2 b , the male tooth 3A is so formed that the inner surface thereof extends linearly along the outer circumferential surface of the first member, with the outer surface thereof Inclined at an angle 6 of about 60 with respect to the direction in which the metal mold 3 is slid along the first member. The outer surface of the male tooth 3A is inclined at the angle 6 to enable the easy removal of the metal mold 3, but this is unnecessary if the male tooth is narrow. As shown in Fig. 2 A , each portion is formed so as to meet following equations L H 1 0.6W b 5 t, preferably b 0.8W 2 0.8b h b 3 0 S b 4 Wherein L width of the bottom portion of the first member H depth of the recess forked in the second member b width of the recess W width of the groove h depth of the recess 9 length of the end portion of the groove from the bottom portion of the first member S distance between the end portion of the groove and the bottom surface of the recess The depth h over which the second member is pressed varies with the pressure, but it should preferably be pressed as far as a position close to the inner edge 2 of the grooves 1B, and it should not be pressed beyond the ridges. h s 9 According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, first and second members are connected in following steps Connecting two member wherein a first cylindrical member and a second member placed opposite one end of said first member are connected together, fitting an end portion of said first member into a recess formed in a surface of said second member, in such a manner that outer and inner circumferential surfaces of said end portion of said first member are substantially held by said recess in said second member or by said first and second mer ers and pressing locally in the axial direction a portion of either said first or second member which is in the vicinity of the joint portion thereof so that it is plastically de ormed into an indented portion of that part, so that said firs and second members are connected toge er by the binding arc e generated in that the section of said one of said members surrounding said indented portion. According to this embodiment, the end portion of a first cylindrical part 1 can be easily fitted perpendicularly into a recess 2A in a second part 2 without the use of a special support block. This connecting structure is especially useful for connecting members that do not pass through each other, and enables a highly accurate hermetic connection of such members. In this structure the joint portion of the softer member flows into spaces between projections provided on the harder member, and is deformed plasticallv and locally thereby.Consequently, elastic stresses are generated in the deformed softer member, so that the softer member is connected wit the harder member with a large binding force, and the connected product thus obtained has an extremely good resistance to rotary torque and pull out forces. Since this structure is obtained at room temperature from beginning to end, the members being connected are not influenced thernally unlike welded or soldered members. This means that the connected ebrs can remain in a stably connected state seiniPefln anently. In the above embodiment, an iron material is quoted as an exampl of a harder material, and aluminum or copper as an example of a softer material, but the material of the member which is most pressed can be any softer material.When both the first and second members being connected are made of iron, for eaple, the first member could be hardened in advance. As previously mentioned, the first member could be formed as a cylinder by the cold pressing. In such a case, the material is hardened naturally, so that that member need not be specially hardened. Fi . 3 is a partially sectioned view of a principal portion of a cylindrical member which is to be connected by another embodiment of the method according to the present invention. The cylindrical member is substantially in the shape of a cup in the same way as the cylindrical member of the previous embodiment, but or a plurality of annular grooves 11B are provided in the portion of the outer circumzerential surface thereof which corresponds to the depth of a otto 11A thereof.The connection structure applied to this member does not differ in any way from that applied to the cylindrical member of the previous embodiment, but it is effective when applied to a member which requires a higher resistance to pull out forces, this member is connected to another in tne rotational direction by only a frictional engagement. Fig. 4 is a partially sectioned view of members connectect by a third embodiment of the structure according to the present invention. The characteristics of this embodiment reside in that a collar 12B is fore around the outer circumferential surface of the bottom of a cylindrical member and an indented portion 32C is formed in an inner circumferential surface 32B of a recess 32A in a second member 32 Twhich faces te collar 123. The collar 12B is fired into the recess 32A in the second member 32 and is then pressed axially by x, a metal mold, so that the material of the collar flows plastically and locally into the indented portion 32C, connecting the two member together firmly. Accordingly, the joint portion of the first member 12 must be made of a material that is softer than the material of the joint portion of the second member 32, but the binding force of this material is in no way less than that of the softer members used in the previous embodiments. Fig. 5 illustrates the structure according to the present invention when applied to a crankshaft of an internalcombustion engine, such as the engine of a motorcycle.Referring to the drawing1 a solid shaft 15 provided with straight splines 15A and an end thread 153 is attached to one surface or an iron flange 34 so that the shaft 15 extends at right angles to the surface of the flange 34. Another solid shaft 16 is attached to the other surface of the flange 34 in a stageered manner With respect to the shaft 15. The connection structure applied to these members is exact g the same as that used in the previou enjodients, but the solid shafts 15, 16 attached to the iron flange 34 are of hardened steel. According to the erruhcdient, complexes parts such as crack shaft are separated Into a plurality of sip ple member and then each member is plastically deformed each other with a butt joint, whereby productivity is improved.
