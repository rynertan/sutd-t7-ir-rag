# Devices for carrying out chemical and clinical tests, and their use.

## Abstract
A device for carrying out chemical or clinical testing of a liquid sample, for example a urine sample, by a specific binding assay, said device comprising a test component 2 which has a sensitised solid surface 2a carrying an immobilised compo nent of a specific binding pair relevant to the assay, and a han dling piece 1 , and characterised in that the test component 2 bearing the sensitised surface 2a is removably mounted in spaced relationship with a removably mounted accessory com ponent 4 carrying an accessory solid surface 5 , and in that there is a space 4a between the sensitised surface 2a and the removable accessory component 4 to act as a container for sample liquid, so that when the device is contacted with a sample liquid source or immersed in liquid which is to provide the test sample, liquid of the sample can enter the space 4a to contact the sensitised surface 2a , and the accessory sur face 5 acts to retain and contain sample liquid in contact with the sensitised surface 2a even after removal of the device from further contact with or immersion in the source of sample liquid, and in that the test component 2 is so formed that after removal of the removable accessory component 4 the sensi tised surface 2a is left exposed and accessible to further treat ment liquid such as washing liquid and or reagents.
