# Method of producing a semiconductor device having isolation regions between elements.

## Abstract
A semiconductor device of transistors, each of which is surrounded with a field oxide film 7 , uses a dielectric isolation structure of a groove filled with an insulating material 15 instead of a PN junction isolation stucture. The field oxide film 7 is formed by selectively oxidizing an epitaxial layer 3 , then the groove extending through the epitaxial layer 3 and a buried layer 2 is formed. After the surface of the groove is covered with an insulating film, e.g., a thermal oxide film 14 by oxidizing the surface, the groove is filled with the filler material 15 .
