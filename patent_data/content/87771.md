# Improved methanation process and Raney catalyst therefor.

## Abstract
A carbon bearing material CO, COâ‚‚ or mixtures thereof is hydrogenated to methane in the presence of a catalyst consisting of a metallic mesh type core, having a Raney metal exterior surface derived from a Ni The catalyst is prepared by coating a mesh structure with an alloy of nickel with the catalytic enhancer and aluminium, then heating it to 660 750 C to allow infusing of aluminium in the mesh structure and leaching out the residual aluminium from the alloy.
