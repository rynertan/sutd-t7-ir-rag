## Description
The invention relates to a charge transfer device com prising a semiconductor body, at a surface of which is defined a charge transport channel for storing and transporting information in the form of discrete charge packets to an output stage, which has a zone for temporarily storing and reading the charge packets and an insulated gate field effect transistor which forms a reset transistor for draining a read charge packet and preparing the said zone for storing and reading a next charge packet, this tran sistor comprising a source region coupled to the said zone, an in sulated gate connected to a clock voltage source for rendering the transistor intermittently conducting and non conducting, and a drain region connected to means for applying a suitable drain voltage. Such a device is known As usual such a charge transfer device comprises a If it should be possible to use a reset transistor of the depletion type, The invention has A charge transfer device according to the invention is characterized in that the said means comprise a second insulated gate field effect transistor, which is designated hereinafter as auxiliary transistor, whose gate and drain can be applied to a fixed voltage V₁, more particularly the supply voltage, and whose source is connected to the drain region of the reset transistor and to current supply means for passing a current through the auxiliary transistor, and in that the gate of the reset transistor is connected to a clock voltage source, by means of which in the conductive state of the reset transistor the voltage V₁ is also applied to the gate of the reset transistor. The voltage of the source of the auxiliary field effect transistor provides for the reduced reset voltage which is applied to the drain of the reset transistor. Since the auxiliary tran sistor is conducting with a gate voltage equal to the supply voltage, the reset transistor will also be conducting with a gate voltage equal to the supply voltage. Preferably, the channel regions of the reset transistor and the auxiliary transistor have at least practically the same dimensions in order to obtain at least practically equal threshold voltages. In charge transfer devices of the type described herein, there is generally arranged between the output stages and the clock electrodes a blocking gate, which during operation is applied to a fixed voltage and serves to avoid cross talk of the clock voltages to the reading zone. The voltage applied to this zone should be such that below this electrode is induced a potential barrier which on the one hand is sufficiently low to transfer charge from below the last clock electrode to the reading zone and on the other hand is so high that a maximum charge packet can be entirely stored in the reading zone and is not partially stored below the blocking gate. A preferred embodiment, in which a potential barrier of suitable height is obtained below the block ing gate also at the reduced voltage at the drain and hence source , is characterized in that there is arranged above the charge trans port channel, viewed in the charge transport direction, in front of the said zone of the output stage an insulated gate, which is connected to the source of the auxiliary field effect transistor. The invention will now be described more fully with reference to a few embodiments, by way of example, and the ac companying diagrammatic drawing, in which Fig. 1 shows diagrammatically a part of a charge trans fer device in accordance with the invention, There is situated behind the last clock electrode the output stage having an n zone 7, in which the transported charge electron packets can be temporarily stored in order to be read out. For this purpose, the n zone is connected In order to reset the n zone 7 each time to a reference level, the output stage is provided with a reset transistor having an insulated gate 13, a drain in the form of an n zone 14 and a source constituted by the zone 7. The gate electrode 13 is driven by a clock voltage There is arranged between the zone 7 and the last clock electrode 4 an additional gate 16, also designated as output gate OG , which is applied to a fixed potential. This output gate serves to prevent cross talk of the clock voltages applied to the clock electrodes 3, 4 to the zone 7. The construction of the out put gate 16 is identical to that of the clock electrodes 3, 4, a part 16a being provided on thinner oxide and a part 16b being pro vided on thicker oxide. The semiconductor body may further be provided, for example, on the back side with a connection 17 for applying a suitable substrate voltage V In contrast with what is usual, For adjusting the current, T₁ is connected to a second transistor T₂, whose drain 24 is connected to the source 22 of T₁, whose gate 25 is connected to the source 22 of T₁ and whose source 26 is connected to the negative supply or earth. During operation, a substrate voltage V The current voltage relation of a MOS transistor can be described on approximation by the equation I In the embodiment described herein, the voltage of the gate 27 source 22 of T₁ is also applied to the blocking gate 16a, 16. When a charge packet is transferred from the region below the clock electrode 3 to the region below the clock electrode 4, the potential well below the clock electrode 3 and the potential barrier below the clock electrode 4 are raised and reduced, respectively. There is a possibility, when the supply voltages are largely exceeded at marginal threshold voltages, that a certain amount of charge from the charge packet to be transferred It will be appreciated that the invention is not limited to the embodiments shown herein, but that many further modifications are possible for those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, instead of the transistor T₂, a current source may alternatively be used in the circuit 18. In the embodiments described, the reset transistor is provided with a single gate electrode. Advantageously, however, the reset transistor may also be provided with two gate electrodes in order to reduce clock cross talk.
