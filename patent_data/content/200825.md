## Description
HYDROCARBON STEAM REFORMING USING SERIES STEAM SUPERHEATERS FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to an improved.process for the steam reforming of hydrocarbon gas feeds, and specifically to a steam reforming process which utilizes series steam superheaters for improved heat integration. DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART Generally, themanufacture of ammonia consists of preparing an ammonia synthesis gas from a nitrogen source, usually air, and from a hydrogen source, which is conventionally either coal, petroleum fractions, or natural gases. For example, in the preparation of ammonia synthesis gas from a light hydrocarbon feedstock, which may range from natural gas to naphtha, the hydrocarbon feedstock gas is first purified by removing gaseous contaminants, such as sulfur which would poison the downstream catalysts from the feedstock by the catalytic hydrogenation of the sulfur compounds to hydrogen sulfide and adsorption of the hydrogen sulfide over a zinc oxide adsorption medium. Subsequent steam reforming of the contaminant free gas provides the major portion of the hydrogen required for ammonia synthesis from the hydro carbons in the gas.Reforming is accomplished by a twostage process in which a mixture o steam and the puri fied feed gas are first reformed over catalyst in a primary reformer, followed by treatment of the partially reformed gas in a secondary reformer to which air is introduced, in order to provide the required amount of N2 for ammonia synthesis. A reformed gas is produced in the secondary reformer having a greater amount of hydrogen and a lesser amount of hydrocarbons.The reaction processes occurring in the reforming of the feedstock gas begin with the breakdown of hydrocarbons to methane, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide EMI2.1 and end with the reforming of these products by the desired endothermic methane reforming reaction EMI2.2 and by accompanying exothermic reactions EMI2.3 The carbon monoxide in the reformed gas is converted to carbon dioxide and additional hydrogen in one or more shift conversion vessels, and the carbon dioxide is removed by scrubbing.Further treatment of the raw synthesis gas by methanation may be used to remove additional carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide from the hydrogen rich gas resulting subsequently in an ammonia synthesis gas containing approximately three parts of hydrogen and one part of nitrogen, that is, the 3 1 stoichiometric ratio of hydrogen to nitrogen in ammonia1 plus small amounts of inerts such as methane, argon and helium.The ammonia synthesis gas is then converted to ammonia by passing the gas over a catalytic surface based upon metallic iron Cconventionally magnetite which has been promoted with other metallic oxides, and wallowing the ammonia to be synthesized according to the following exothermic reaction EMI2.4 Conventional reforming ammonia plant designs recover all of the waste heat available from cooling the secondary reformer effluent typically at temperaures of from 1600 to 19000F down to a temperature suitable for high temperature shift converter operation which typically employs an inlet temperature of from 316 to 399 C by generation of high pressure saturated steam.Since saturated steam temperatures at pressures within the realm of proven steam turbine technology are no more than about 343 C, this results in a substantial temperature downgrading of the heat available in the secondary reformer effluent, which is undesirable from the standpoint of the second law of thermodynamics. Even more importantly, it represents a severe restriction on steam balance fiexibility since the waste heat goes only into saturated steam generation. In U.S. Patent 3,441,393 to Pullman, a series of two saturated steam generators are employed to recover heat from the secondary reformer effluent. Various patents to ICI have issued in which the secondary reformer effluent is first employed to generate saturated steam in a first steam generator and is then used to generate superheated steam from steam passed thereto from a steam superheater which in turn has recovered heat from the ammonia synthesis reactor effluent.Finally, additional quantities of saturated steam are generated in a second steam generator from the secondary reformer effluent, before this effluent is passed to the shift conversion. U.S. Patents 4,213,954 and 4,264,567 illustrate these systems. U.S. Patent 4,367,206 to ICI produces methanol and ammonia in a process in which heat is recovered from the effluent of one ammonia synthesis reactor catalyst stage by superheating steam which is then further superheated by indirect heat exchange with secondary reformer effluent.However, such a process is not easily employed in combination with newer ammonia synthesis reactor designs which employ iarge volumes of conventional catalyst to improve energy efficiencyana which mally operate at lower temperatures, nor with newer ammonia synthesis catalysts which also optimally operate at lower temperatures. Aiso, the process requires the use of expensive, high pressure shells in said superheat exchanger equipment since, if energy efficient high pressure steam generation is employed, both fluids exchanging heat would have pressures exceeding 1000 psig 1000 2200 psig on the steam side and 55F00 41,370 kPa on the reactor effluent side . U.S. Patent 3,442,613 to Braun also illustrates a system in which saturated steam is generated by heat recovery from the secondary reformer effluent. Another patent in this vein is U.S. Patent 3,947,551 to.Benfielde SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In a process for steam reforming of a hydrocarbon gas feedstream wherein a the hydrocarbon gas feedstream is partially reformed at elevated temperatures in indirect heat exchange with hot combustion gases in a direct fired primary reforming furnace provided with a convection section for recovery of excess heat from said combustion gases and b the partially reformed feedstream is then further reformed in the presence of an oxygen containing gas and steam in a secondary reformer to form a secondary reformer gaseous effluent the improvement which comprises recovering waste heat from said secondary reformer effluent gas and from said primary reforming combustion products by i heating high pressure saturated steam in a first steam superheating zone by indirect heat exchange with at least 2 portion of said secondary reformer effluent gas to form a first superheated steam stream and ii further heating said first superheated steam in a second steam superheating zone by indirect heat exchange with at least a portion of said primary reformer hot combustion gases to form a second superheated steam stream With the increasing emphasis on development of low energy ammonia plant deigns, more and more process waste heat is recovered by way of steam production, while other energy saving features manifest themselves in reductions of steam consumption. These combined effects tend to make a new highly efficient design a net exporter of steam.However, if uses for export steam are limited, either the energy cannot be saved in the first place or the excess steam must be diverted to inefficient electric power turbogeneration. Turbogeneration requires a very high investment, and is particularly unattractive if low cost coal, nuclear or hydroelectric based electricity is available. The current invention minimizes steam production, while maintaining high energy efficiency.

Figure 2 is a diagrammatic illustration of the high pressure steam and heat recovery system of an integrated hydrocarbon steam reforming process, as described inExample 1. Figure 3 is a diagrammatic illustration of a por tion of the process of Figure 1 showing a method for controlled generation of superheated steam from secondary reformer effluent waste heat. Figure 4 is a diagrammatic illustration of a por tion of the process of Figure 1 in which yet another method is used for controlled generation of superheated steam from secondary reformer effluent waste heat. Figure 5 is a diagrammatic illustration of a por tion of the process of Figure i in which still another method is used for controlled generation of superheated steam from secondary reformer effluent waste heat. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Referring to Figure 1, there is seen a primary reforming furnace stage generally indicated by the nu meral 10, having convection section 4, and primary re forming radiant section 18 heated by burners not shown, and mounted, for example, in the floor of the radiant section which are supplied with fuel gas 14 and an oxidant gas e.g., combustion air 16 as illustrated. Hot flue gas exiting the radiant section flows through convection section 4, past process steam superheat exchanger 21, process air which may contain steam and air heat exchanger 26, power steam superheat exchanger 25, feed gas heat exchanger 24, and boiler feed water preheat 22, and is discharged through stack 2.Therefore pri mary reformer 10 is direct fired by means of the combustion of fuel gas 14 and the oxidant gas 16 therein. It will be understood that the direction of flow of the hot combustion gases through primary reformer 10 is not critical, and primary reformer 10 can comprise any conventional primary reformer design, such as is illustrated inU.S. Patent 4,213,954, wherein the combustion gas is passed downwardly from the upper portion of the reformer s radiant section and wherein the convection section is horizontally disposed. The two stage reforming process requires the introduction of four separate process streams to the primary reformer feed gas for a source of hydrogen , steam, an oxygen containing gas and fuel gas. In addition, where the process is intended for use in producing an ammonia synthesis gas, a source of nitrogen gas which is generally air is added in the secondary reforming stage. Feed gas is introduced into the process via conduit 6 and passes through feed gas heat exchanger 24, positioned in the primary reforming furnace s convection section 4. This preheats the feed gas to approximately 750OF. The gas feedstocks 6 which can be treated in accordance with the process of this invention can vary widely. Suitable feed gases include coke gas or refinery gases, such as are discussed in U.S. Patent 3,649,558, in addition to coal pyrolysis gas, and feedstocks such as those available from intermediate BTU gas IBG streams resulting from the gasification of coal or lignite using conventional gasification processes. Also suitable as feeds are natural gas, naphtha, liquefied petroleum gas LPG , liquefied natural gas LNG and the like. The heated feed gas is withdrawn from exchanger 24 via conduit 38 and may be admixed with H2 containing gas and then contacted at elevated temperatures with a conventional hydrodesulfurization catalyst such as a supported Co Mo or Ni Mo hydrodesulfurization catalyst to convert the S compounds in the feed gas to S forms which can then be removed in sulfur removal zone 44. Alternatively, or in addition to hydrodesulfuriza tion zone 40, feed gas 38 can be admixed with sufficient steam to supply the water of reaction required for a subsequent COS hydrolysis reaction if COS is present in the feed. The quantity of steam which is thus introduced can vary widely and will generally comprise from about 2 to 4 vol. , based on the total feed gas in conduit 38 withdrawn from exchanger 24. The COS reaction can be effected by any conventional means, using conventional hydrolysis catalysts such as activated alumina. In this reactor, COS contained in the feed gas is converted into hydrogen sulfide gas at conventional hydrolysis conditions, which typically range from about 149 to 1770C and from about 2069 to 4137 kPA. The gas mixture resulting from the hydrodesulfurization treatment or from a COS hydrolysis step may contain hydrogen sulfide, and is introduced via conduit 42 into sulfur removal zone 44, generally at a gas temperature of from about 316 to 3990Ci and hydrogen sulfide impurities are removed from the gas stream by conventional technology, such as by use of a zinc oxide adsorption bed. The gas, now essentially free of sulfur impurities e.g., containing less than about 0.2 ppm by weight of sulfur compounds, caiculated as elemental sulfur , is withdrawn via conduit 54 and admixed with steam, which can be accomplished by injecting steam into conduit 54 via conduit 12 and which can comprise at least a portion of steam turbine 50 exhaust.Normally, either the turbine exhaust steam 12 is heated before mixing with the desulfurized feedstock gas, or this exhaust steam is first admixed wth the feedstock gas and the resulting mixture is heated, before being passed to the primary reforming step. Again, the quantity of steam introduced at this point can vary, and will generally range from about 2.5 to 5.0 moles per mole of carbon in the desulfurized gas feed. The function of the steam introduced at this point in the process is to provide the water of reaction necessary for the subsequent reforming reactions.The steam desulfurized gas mixture is then introduced into the tubes 56 of primary reformer 10 wherein the feed gas is at least partially reformed by contacting the feed gas, under reforming conditions, in tubes 56 with a conventional reforming catalyst. Any conventional primary reforming catalyst can be employed, such as nickel, nickel oxide, chromia, molybdenum, mixtures thereof and the like, with nickel on calcium aluminate or nickel onalumina being preferred. The temperature within tubes 56 will generally range from about 427 to 816 C and the pressure will generally range from about 2069to 6900 kPa, and the total gas hourly space velocity in tubes 56 will generally range from about 5000 to 15,000 v v hr., with a range of from 6000 to 10,000 v v hr. being preferred. As a result of the reforming reactions occurring in tubes 56 of primary reformer 10, substantially all of the hydrocarbon components of the feed gas other than methane are converted to CE4, CO, CO2 and H2 a portion of the original methane component is likewise converted toCO, CO2 and H2 and the temperature of the gas mixture will be generally increased to about 677 to 8020C. The partially reformed gas will generally have a residual methane level of from about 5 to 20 vol. CE4, on a dry basis. The hot combustion gases travel past the exterior of tubes 56 out of radiant section 18 and into convection section 4 wherein the hot gases contact heat exchangers 21, 26, 25, 24, and 22, for recovery of heat by exchange with various streams. The precise number and sequence of the convection section heat exchangers can be chosen using conventional techniques to minimize investment and or maximize energy recovery. For example, one or more heat exchangers may be split into separate units in convection section 4 to achieve a more favorable temperature profile. Boiler feed water 8 is passed through heat exchanger 22 and then via conduit 30 to steam drum 100, from which steam is passed for superheating through exchangers 80 and 25, as will be described in more detail below , to achieve a steam temperature of approximately 482 C.Additional boiler feed water preheated by other means, can be also passed tosteamdrum 100, if desired. This steam is then passed to turbine 50 to generate work, and the resulting steam from turbine exhaust line 52 is partially withdrawn via conduit 28 and the remainder is passed to heat exchanger 21 for reheating of the exhaust steam to about .6490C in indirect heat exchange in convection section 4, and thence to conduit 12. The thus preheated steam is combine with the desulfurized feed gas and fed to catalyst filled reformer tubes 56 in radiant section 18. Process air obtained from any convenient source is preheated by passing it via conduit 32 to primary reformer convection exchanger 26 wherein it is heated generally to a temperature of from about 482 to 7040C by indirect heat exchange with the hot primary reformer convection gas. Prior to or at an intermediate point in the heating process, the air may be mixed with a portion of turbine exhaust steam 13. The thus heated process air with or without admixed steam is introduced via conduit 34 into secondary reformer 60, together with the partially reformed gas mixture which is introduced via conduit 58. The quantity of air introduced via conduit 34 is adjusted using conventional control means not shown , to provide an air feed ratio sufficient to yield about a 3 1 hydrogen nitrogen ratio in the ammonia synthesis gas, that is, to provide a B2 N2 ratio of from about 2.6 1 to 3.2 1, and preferably from about 2.7 1 to 3.2 1. Secondary reformer 60 can comprise an adiabatic reformer of conventional design and during steady state operation achieves further reforming by means of the heat released therein from the exothermic reaction of oxygen with partially reformed feedstock. The amount and type of catalyst in reformer 60 is also conventional, with Ni catalysts supported on alumina being typical. The secondary reformer will generally employ an outlet temperature of from about 871 to 1038 C, a pressure of from about 2069 to 6900 kPa, and a total gas hourly space velocity of from about 600U to 10,000 v v hr. The ref ormer effluent gas generally having a temperature of from about 871 to 1038 C and a residual level of from about 0.2 to 2.0 vol. CH4, on a dry basis is withdrawn from secondary reformer 60 via conduit 62 and is passed to steam generator 70 in which saturated high pressure steam is generated and withdrawn via con duit 74 from preheated feedwater passed to generator 70 via conduit 72.The thus generated high pressure steam 74 is passed to steam drum 100, which also provides the source of the preheated feedwater 72 generally preheated to a temperature of from about 232 to 343 C . The resulting partially cooled secondary reformer effluent generally at a stream temperature of from about 454 to 8160C is withdrawn via conduit 76 and then passed to steam superheater 80 for superheating of steam which is passed thereto via conduit 82 generally at a temperature of from about 232 to 3430C, and about 2760 to 15,170 kPa.from steam drum 100 to produce superheated steam. The superheated steam b4 generally 2 a temperature of about 260 to 5100C and about 2760 to 15,170 k is passed to superheat exchanger 25 in the primary reformer convection section 4, for generation of a higher level superheat therein, generally forming superheated steam having a temperature of from about 316 to 566 C. From superheater 60, the cooled reformer effluent is passed via conduit 86 to high temperature shift HTS converter 90, wherein carbon monoxide in the reformer effluent gas is converted over conventional catalysts and using conventional methods and equipment to carbon dioxide and additional hydrogen. Generally, a temperature of from about 316 to 4820C and a pressure of from about 2069to 6900 kPa will be employed in converter 90, and the catalyst will generally comprise a supported1 chromium promoted iron catalyst.Thereafter, gas exiting the high temperature shift converter is withdrawn via conduit 92 and is passed to a second steam generator 94 in which saturated steam 98 is produced from water feed 96 and is returned to drum 100 from which water 96 was received. The partially cooled high temperature shift effluent from generator 94 op tionally after further heat recovery, as for example in a separate boiler feedwater preheat exchanger is fed to low temperature shift LTS converter 105, or preferably first to guard bed 190. Guard bed 190, which is optional, is preferably employed to treat gas stream 99 upstream of low temperature shift converter 105 to remove halide and sulfur impurities and thereby protect any halide and sulfursensitive catalyst in low temperature shift converter 105. The operation of guard bed 190 and the type of catalyst used therein e.g., zinc oxide promoted with copper oxide , is conventional, and this step is generally conducted at temperatures and pressures within the ranges used in low temperature shift converter 105 as described below, and the solids employed in guard bed 190 for such halide and S impurities removal can comprise. the same catalyst as is used in low temperature shift converter 105. In shift converter 105, a low temperature shift conversion reaction is effected over conventional catalyst using conventional methods and equipment to form additional quantities of H2 and CO2. Generally, a temperature of from about 20 4 to 2600C and a pressure of from about 2069 to 6900 kPa will be employed in converter 105, and the catalyst will generally comprise a mixture of zinc and copper oxides. The effluent gas from low temperature shift converter 105 is then cooled in heat recovery zone 114 which can comprise one or more heat exchange vessels , and the cooled, low temperature shift converter effluent gas 103, now depleted of its heat values, is passed to CO2 removal zone 110, in which any conventional process e.g., solvent absorption of CO2 gas can be used to remove CO2 via conduit 111.The resulting, substantially CO2 free gas is fed by conduit 112 to conventional methanator zone 120 which normally includes one or more heat exchangers for removal of additional CO and CO2 and is then withdrawn via conduit 124 , compressed in compressor 130 and passed as direct feed via conduit 126 to ammonia synthesis and recovery zone 140, wherein NH3 is formed from the H2. N2 synythesis gas 126 i.e., about 3 1 H2 N2 molar ratio using conventional techniques i.e., over Fe catalyst at 316 to 538 C . Waste gases are withdrawn via conduit 142 to purge methane and argon impurities introduced into zone 140, and product NH3 is recovered via conduit 144. Excess heat in the ammonia synthesis section is removed by means of heat removal means 152 which can comprise heat exchangers, boilers, and the like. The operations of CO2 removal zone 110, methanation zone 120, compressor 130 and NH3 synthesis zone 140 are conventional and need not be more completely described for a full understanding of the process of this inven tion. The precise operating parameters and equipment of each such process step, there ore, will be readily apparent to one having ordinary skill in the art, and each step can include the usual internal recycle streams and stages found usefui in the prior art.Thus, CO removal zone 110 can include conventional CO2 absorption and CO2 desorption stages wherein the CO2 laden gas 103 is contacted with a liquid containing either a solvent for, or a dissolved compound e.g., K2Co3 readily reactive with, the CO2 the CO2 free gases generally containing less than about 0.3 vol. CO2 are withdrawn and the solvent is treated to desorb the CO2 gases 111 for recycle of solvent to the absorber. Zone 110 can also employ conventional pressure swing adsorption methods for CO2 removal.Exemplary of suitable conventional CO2 removal systems are those discussed in Kirk Othmer, Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 3d ed., vol. 2, pp. 492 494 t1978 . Similarly, methanator 120 will generally employ a temperature in the range of about 260 to 4820C, 2 pressure from about 2069 to 6g0t kPa, and a supported Ni catalyst e.g., Ni on alumina to convert any remainingCO and CO2 in gas stream 112 to methane, thereby prodUc ing an effluent gas 124 containing less than about 10 vppm í.e., parts per million by volume of total CO andCO2, and B2 and N2 in a H2 N2 molar ratio of from about 2.6 1 to 3.2 1.Compression in zone 130 can take place in several stages, as desired, to bring the methanator effluent to synthesis reactcr pressure, which generally ranges from about 10,340 to 34,470 kPa. If desired, compressors 130 can be located upstream of zone 110, to compress the gas prior to treatment in zone 110. Finally, ammonia synthesis zone 140 can include conventional dryer units wherein trace water is removed from the syn gas as required and conventional purge recovery units wherein a portion or all of the gas effluent from the ammonia synthesis reactor is treated to recover and recycle B2 to the reactor and to remove inerts such asCH4 and Ar therefrom. If desired, such conventional dryer units can instead be located prior to or at an intermediate point within gas compression stage zone 130. The improved process of tis invention produces a syn gas 126, having a H2 N2 molar ratio of about 3 1, that is a H2 N2 molar ratio of from about 2.6 1 to 3.2 1, and which has a residual methane concentration dry basis of less than about 3 vol. , and more typically less than about 2 vol. , and which is therefore particularly suitable for direct feed to an ammonia synthesis reactor zone 140, that is a syn gas 126 which is not subjected to a cryogenic purification following methanator 120 to remove excess nitrogen and or methane prior to the ammonia synthesis reaction.If desired, syn gas 126 can be subjected to a cryogenic purification prior to introduction into ammonia synthesis reactor zone 140, for example by use of the cryogenic purification method of U.S. Patent 3,442,613, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. In Figure 3, there is illustrated a preferred method for generating superheated steam by recovery of waste heat from the secondary reformer effluent 62, which is produced as illustrated in Figure 1. In the embodiment of Figure 3, a secondary ref ormer effluent 62 is first passed to saturated steam generator 70 for generation of saturated high pressure steam 74 from preheated water stream 72. The partially cooled secondary reformer effluent 76 is withdrawn from boiler 70 and passed to first series steam superheater 89 for generation of superheated steam 84 which is passed to convection section superheater 25 as described above.In this embodiment, the high pressure steam passed to superheat exchanger 89 is steam 77, which is produced from high pressure saturated steam 82 in second heat exchanger 85 to form a further heated steam 81, which is then combined.with any by pass steam fiowing through valve 75 to conduit 87 and passed via conduit 77 to the first exchanger 89. The heating medium for second exchanger 85 comprises the further cooled secondary reformer effluent 79 which is withdrawn from first superheat exchanger 89. There is thus formed the de sired secondary reformer effluent stream 86 which can then be passed to shift conversion or boiler as described above.In the embodiment of Figure 3, the position of valve 75 in by pass conduit 87 is controlled to achieve the desired temperature T111 in superheated steam 36 leaving superheater 25, which is positioned in convection section 4, as described above.A second by pass conduit, conduit 62b around steam generator 70, is provided having a control valve 62a, the position of which is controlled to achieve the desired temperature T1 the cooled secondary effluent stream 86 leaving steam superheat exchanger 85. Such feedback control valves 75 and 62a permit lower metal temperatures in exchanger 89 and thereby allow use of lower cost metallurgy and or provide longer exchanger service life. Therefore, in Figure 3, the first steam superheating zone comprises a series of two superheaters 89 and 85. The preferred split of superheat duty between secondary reformer effluent superheat exchanger s 80 and the convection section superheater 25 depends on the overall plant steam and heat balance. Preferably, the amount of steam superheating done in the secondary reformer effluent superheat exchanger s 80 should be just enough to eliminate the need for auxiliary firing in the reformer furnace convection section i.e., set so that total superheating duty can be supplied without auxiliary firing yet not so great as to require installation of a convection section boiler to fully recover available convection section waste heat. Referring to Figure 4, the embodiment of Figure 3 is illustrated wherein the position of valve 75 in bypass conduit 87 is controlled to achieve the desired temperature T3 in gas stream 86, which comprises the feedstream to high temperature shift zone 90. The sensed temperature T2 of superheated steam 36 leaving convection section supereater 25 is employed to control the position of valve 62a in by pass ine 62b which is provided about steam generator 70 to control the amount of secondary reformer effluent 62 which is passed to generator 70. Referring now to Figure 5, secondary reformer effluent 62 is passed to saturated steam generator 70 for generation of saturated high pressure steam 74 from preheated water stream 72. The partially cooled secondary reformer effluent 76 is withdrawn from boiler 70 and passed to steam superheater 80 for generation of superheated steam 84 which is passed to convection section superheater 25 as described above. A by pass line 87 is provided about exchanger 80 and is provided with valve 75, whose position is controlled to achieve the desired temperature T4 of superheated steam 36, in order to control the amount of saturated high pressure steam 82 which is passed to superheater 80. Superheater 80 can of course be optionally further split into two exchangers in series with steam by pass and control means arranged as illustrated in Figure 3 . There is thus formed a partially cooled secondary reformer effluent stream 180 which can then be passed to a second saturated steam generator 170 for generation of additional saturated high pressure steam 174 from preheated water stream 172, and to form a further cooled secondary reformer effluent stream 86 which can be passed to shift conversion zone 90 as described above. By pass line 176, which is provided with valve 175, is preferably provided about the second boiler 170 to control the amount of secondary reformer effluent which is passed to boiler 170 Preferably, valve 175 is controlled to achieve the desired temperature T5 which is sense in stream 86. The improved process of this invention can be further illustrated by reference to the following examples. EXAMPLE 1 To compare the improvements achieved by the process of this invention, the following cases have been studied, referring to the simplified ammonia plant high pressure steam and heat system schematic illustrated inFigure 2. The terms employed in Figure 2 are defined as set forth in Table 1 below.

Also, in Figure 2, the term blowown is intended to refer to the small amount of water conventionally purged from boilers to avoid excessive buildup of trace non volatile impurities entering the boiler with the feed water. Auxiliary firing refers to conventional auxiliary burners employed in the convection section of the primary reforming furnace. In Case A, the process of this invention is il illustrated employing the embodiment of Figure 1 and using series steam superheaters 80 and 25 as described above to form an ammonia synthesis gas.In Case B, the embodiment of Figure 1 is modified and all steam superheating is performed in the primary reformer furnace s convection section, and effluent waste heat is used only for generation of saturated steam i.e., no steam superheater 80 is used . In Case C, Figure 1 is modi fied such that all steam superheating is performed using secondary reformer effluent waste heat, and no convection section superheater 25 is used. in Case D, a conventional convection section boiler is provided in the primary reformer of Case C. Referring to Table 2, the series superheaters arrangement of Case A can be compared with the most conventional approach in Case B of doing all superheating in the reformer furnace convection section, and using secondary reformer effluent waste heat only for saturated steam production. The series superheatersCase A adjusts the heat duty split between the two superheaters to yield a total reformer furnace convection section duty QCONV 185.8 Gj hr that uses all the heat available for these Examples, down to a target stack temperature of 160 0C in the flue gas leaving the reformer radiant section, but does not require any auxiliary fuel firing in the convection section.The conventional Case B same radiant section reformer firing and heat duty as Case A does not have the flexibility of the series superheater approach, and produces a great deal of extra steam in the secondary reformer effluent waste heat boiler BOIL2 rises to 190.5 Gj hr in Case B from 105.2 Gj hr in Case A . This requires more boiler feedwater which raises the convection section boiler feedwater preheat duty QECO is 112.3 Gj hr vs. 70.6 Gj hr . The increased steam production also boosts the total supérheating duty substantially QSHTF plus QSHT2 is 129.4 GjYhr vs. 97.1 Gj hr in Case A . Combining these effects, one sees a steam production S1500 increase in Case 3 of 52808 kgm hr, at the expense of a convection heat duty jump of 159.4 Gj hr Assuming a 08 efficienc,7 of the primary reformer furnace, this requires auxiliary fuel firing QAUX of 177.1 Gj LHV hr, which corresponds to 4. 2 Gj LHV MeT NH3.Unless a highly efficient use could be found for the incremental steam production, a huge energy penalty would be incurred. Cases C and D illustrate the opposite situation to Case B, with all superheating being done with secondary reformer effluent waste heat no convection section superheater . In Case C, there is no steam generation in the primary reformer furnace convection section. Case D adds a conventional boiler to Case C for steam generation in the convection section. In Case C, without a convection section boiler, total steam production goes down to 13,074 kgm hr, because more of the secondary ref ormer effluent waste heat must go for superheating, and correspondingly less is available for steam generation. Economizer duty also falls in Case C, because less boiler feedwater must be preheated. Overall, the total convection section duty drops no superheating and smaller economizer duty to 170 Gj hr. Since the natural heat available in the convection section flue gas without auxiliary firing i.e., the heat available from cooling the flue gas to the 1600C target stack temperature is 185.9 Gj Xhr, 15. 9 Gj hr is wasted up the stack.If this must be made up in a 90 efficient offsite boiler, the extra firing requirement would be 17.7 Gg LHV hr, which corresponds to 0.4 Gj LHV MeT NE3. If a convection section boiler is provided as inCase D, the secondary reformer effluent steam generation lost when doing all the superheating with second ary reformer effluent can be made up in the reformer furnace convection section. One can then end up with an identical overall energy balance to the series superheaters Case A. As can be seen from Table 2, total convection section duties CONS and total steam generations 51500 are the same. In this situation, the advantage for the series superheaters concept lies not in energy credits or increased steam production flexibility, but rather in simplifying the process arrangement. With a convection section boiler,. a forced boiler water circulation system is normally required.This adds the investment, operating cost and reliability debits of having boiler water circulating pumps. Conversely, without a convection section boiler, as in the series superheaters concept, a simpler natural boiler water circulation system normally can be used, eliminating the need for boilerwater circulating pumps. Overall, the use of series superheaters 80 and 25 according to the process of this invention offeros substantial advantages over conventional ammonia plant arrangements, especially for low energy designs with limited steam export potential, and particularly for designs employing low severity reforming, wherein the secondary reformer effluent possesses greater than about 0.8 vol. methane dry basis .

EXAMPLE 2 To provide further evidence of the process improvements achieved by this invention, the following additional cases have been studied, again referring to the simplified ammonia plant high pressure steam and heat systems schematic illustrated in Figure 2 and employing the identified terms of Table 1 above. Case A represents the process of this invention as described in Example 1. In Case A, no superheating of steam is accomplished in heat recovery zone 152 in ammonia synthesis converter zone 140. In Case E, the process of Figure 1 is modified by superheating steam in converter synthesis zone 140, e.g., in a steam superheating exchanger 152 in indirect heat exchange with the ammonia reactor effluent gas, and then further superheating in a second superheater 25 provided in the convection section of the primary reformer as in Figure 1. 1QSHTC in Table 3 refers to the heat duty in the superheater provided in ammonia synthesis converter zone 140 to recover heat from the effluent of the ammonia synthesis reactor. Therefore, in Case E, superheated steam is not produced by recovery of heat from the secondary reformer effluent. The process of Figure 1 is modified in Case F in that the convection section of the primary reformer is not provided with either a superheater exchanger or a boiler in order to generate steam, and all steam superheating is accomplished by means of a superheater 152 positioned at the effluent of the ammonia synthesis reactor and a second superheater 80 in the secondary reformer effluent. Case G represents the modification to Case F, wherein a boiler is also provided in the primary reformer convection section. Finally, in Case H, the process of Case F is modified by the addition of a superheater 25 in the primary reformer convection section. Referring to Table 3, the series superheaters arrangement cf Case A can be compare with Case E, which employs a superheater in ammonia synthesis converter zone 140 and a superheater in the primary reformer convection section, but not 2 secondary reformer effluent superheater. For Case E to yield an equivalent steam and energy balance to Case A, the ammonia synthesis converter zone superheater duty, QSHTC, should be able to fully substitute for the secondary reformer effluent superheater duty, QSHT2, in Case A.However, the temperature of the ammonia synthesis reactor effluent is much lower than that of secondary reformer effluent, even after secondary reformer effluent has been partially cooled in a boiler as in Case A.Accordingly, it may not be possible to achieve a sufficiently high superheated steam temperature in an ammonia reactor effluent superheater to provide the desired heat duty. In the example illustrated by CaseE, the ammonia synthesis converter effluent temperature is 444 C, and the maximum steam superheat temperature achievable in a heat exchanger using converter effluent as a heat source was assumed to be 4170C r in order to provide a 10 C driving force for heat transfer. With a steam outlet temperature limited to 417 C , the ammonia reactor effluent superheater duty QSHTC was limited to 71,5 Gj hr, as compared to 85.3 Gj hr for QSHT2 in Case A. This leaves Case E with a shortage of steam superheating capability and a surplus of steam generating capability.To bring Case E back into balance, it is therefore necessary to provide auxiliary firing in the reformer furnace convection section to supply additional superheating duty. The net effect is that total steam generation S1500 goes up from 158,307 Kgm in Case A to 166,923 Kgm in Case E, at the tense of 28.9 Gj hr of auxiliary firing QAUX in Case E assuming 90 percent primary reformer furnace efficiency , which corresponds to 0.7 Qj LHV MeT NH3 Unless a highly efficient use could be found for the incremental steam production, a large energy penaity would thus be incurred.Moreover, the ammonia synthesis reactor effluent superheater employed in Case E must of necessity utilize an expensive high pressure shell mechanical design because both fluids are at a high pressure, so that no matter which one is passed through the shell side of the heat exchanger, the shell sees a high pressure. Cases F H illustrate the effect of using a secondary reformer effluent superheater plus an ammonia syn.thesis converter effluent superheater. Case F does not however include a primary reformer convection section boiler or superheater. Its overall energy and steam balance is equivalent to that of Case C, because without either a boiler or a superheater in the reformer convection section, the total convection section heat available down to 160 C stack temperature cannot be utilized. If the lost convection section heat recovery must be made up in a 90 percent efficient offsite boiler, the extra firing requirement would be 17.7Gj SHV hr, which cbrresponds to 0.4 Gj LHV MeT NH3.Moreover, as with Case E, the ammonia synthesis reactor effluent superheater employed must in necessity utilize an expensive high pressure shell mechanical design because both fluids are at high pressure and therefore the shell side will be exposed to a high pressure no matter which fluid is passed through the shell side of the heat exchanger. Note that the same overall Case F heat and steam balance can be produced over a fairly broad range of values for QMISC, QBOIL2,QSHT2 and QSHTC. Notes 9 , 10 , 11 and 14 define the aliowableranges for the variables. If, for example, QSHTC were set to zero, Case F would reduce toCase C.If, at the other extreme, QSHTC was set to its maximum value of 65.6 Gj hr 100C driving force in converter effluent superheater , QMISC would be 139.7 Gj hr per Note 9 , QSHT2 would be 28.1 Gj hr perNote 11 , and QBOIL2 would be 162.4 Gj hr per Note 10 . Obviously, any intermediate value of QSHTC could also be used, with corresponding QMISC, QSHT2 andQBOIL2 values calculated. Since the overall steam and energy balance would be unchanged, the optimum value ofQSHTC could be selected so as to minimize investment requirements using conventional means for determining that optimum point. Case G utilizes an ammonia synthesis reactor effluent superheater, a secondary reformer effluent superheater and a primary reformer convection section boiler. It yields the same overall heat and steam balance as does the series superheaters Case A, and is actually quite analogous to Case D. The advantage ofCase A vs. Case G is therefore not in terms of energy credits or increased steam production flexibility, but rather in simplifying the process arrangement. Cases A and G each employ two power steam superheaters, butCase G additionally employs a primary reformer convection section boiler. In addition to that representing an extra piece of heat exchange equipment, a convection section boiler normally requires a forced boiler water circulation system, which adds the investment, operating costs and reliability debits of having boiler water circulating pumps.Conversely, without a convection section boiler, a simpler natural boiler water circulation system normally can be used. Another disadvantage of Case G is that, as with Cases E and F, the ammonia synthesis reactor effluent superheater employed must of necessity utilize an expensive high pressure shell mechanical design because both fluids are at high pressure, so that no matter which one is passed through the shell side of the heat exchanger, the shell sees a high pressure. The overall energy and steam balance illustraded for Case G can be achieved while using a range of heat duties for QMISC, QBOIL2, QSHT2 and QSHTC, as described in Table 3 Notes 9 , 10 , i2 and 15 .If QSHTC is set at zero i.e., eliminating ammonia synthesis reactor effluent superheater , Case G reduces to Case D. At the other extreme, if QSHTC is set at a .0 maximum value of 67.8 hr 10 C driving force in converter effluent superheater , QMISC is then 137.5 Gj hr per Note 9 , QSHT2 is 29.2 Gj hr per Note 12 ana QBOIL2 is 161.3 Gj hr per Note 10 . Regardless of the QSHTC duty chosen, QBOILF is 11.7 Gj hr and QECO is 70.6 Gj hr, the same values as inCase D. As with Case F, the specific value of QSHTC chosen can be set by a conventional optimization of investment cost. Case H employs an ammonia synthesis reactor effluent superheater, a secondary reformer effluent superheater and a primary reformer convection section superheater, but no convection section boiler. It yields the same overall energy and steam balance as does the Case A series superheater arrangement. Therefore, the advantage of a series superheaters concept over the Case H arrangement lies not in energy credits or increased steam production flexibility but rather in simplifying the process arrangement. Case A requires one less superheater than Case H. Moreover, the ammonia synthesis reactor effluent superheater employed in Case H must of necessity utilize an expensive high pressure shell mechanical design because both fluids are at high pressure, so that no matter which one is passed through the shell side of the heat exchanger, the shell sees a high pressure. Case H gives the identical overall energy and steam balance over a range of heat duties for QMISC, QBOIL2, QSHT2 and QSHTC, as limited by the relationships described in Notes 9 , 10 , 13 and 15 . If QSHTC is set at zero, Case H reduces to the Case A series superheaters arrangement i.e., ammonia synthesis reactor effluent superheater is eliminated . At the other extreme, if QSHTC is set at its maximum value of 67.8 Gj hr to provide the minimum 10 C heat transfer driving force , QMISC would be 137.5 Gj hr per Note 9 , QSHT2 would be 17.5 GT hr per Note 13 and QBOIL2 would be 173.0 Gj hr per Note 10 .Any intermediate value of QSHTC is feasible, with the optimum value determinable by conventional means in order to minimize investment.

While the process of this invention has been described above in relation to production of ammonia synthesis gas, containing mixtures of hydrogen and nitrogen suitable for feed to an ammonia synthesis reactor for formation of ammonia, it will also be understood that the process of this invention is also suitable for formation of hydrogen enriched gases, and that the foregoing description can be modified by substituting a nitrogen depleted or nitrogen free oxygencontaining gas for the process air 32.Thus, oxygenenriched gas can be passed via conduit 32 to exchanger 26 for preheating for introduction into secondary reformer 60 by means of conduit 34, to provide the oxygen requirements for the secondary reforming reaction and to produce a secondary reformer effluent 62 which is enriched in hydrogen and which can then be treated as described above for generation of superheated steam and subjected to the conventional steps of high temperature shift and low temperature shift conversion, carbon oxide removal and drying or other conventional purification steps, such as pressure swing adsorption, to form the desired hydrogen enriched gas, which will generally contain hydrogen in an amount of from about 60 to 100 vol. on a dry basis.Any of the abovediscussed feed gas streams 6 which are reformable can be used as a feed, and the process conditions described above are equally suitable.
