A male electrical connector 2 for mating with a female electrical connector 4 has a latch arm 18 with a spur 22 for engaging in an opening 42 in the remale electrical connector. For separating the connectors 2 and 4 the male connector 2 has an ejector bar 6 pivoted thereto. When the bar 6 is depressed, the central part thereof depresses the latch arm 18 to disengage the spur 22 from the opening 42 and camming heads 60 on the ends of the bar 6 engage end walls 35 of the connector 4 to lift the connector 2 therefrom. The ejector bar 6 has a central cam surface 58 , and a camming head 60 at each end having a trunnion 64 for releasably connecting the bar 64 to the male connector 2 .
