# Video recording and reproducing apparatus.

## Abstract
A portable video tape recorder for broadcasting applica tions comprises a pair of video heads B, B mounted diamet rically opposite to each other on the circumference of a rotary cylinder. High and low frequency carriers are modulated by frequency modulators 5, 6 with I and Q signals, respectively, and frequency division multiplexed for application to the video heads. The frequency values of the carriers are selected so that third order distortion noise caused by the hysteresis characteristics of the video heads and the magnetic tape may fall within a frequency range higher than the frequencies of the modulated carriers by an amount greater than the band width of the I and Q signals which are demodulated by fre quency demodulators 49, 50 39, 40 to prevent the occurr ence of beat interference in the frequency band of the repro duced video signal.
