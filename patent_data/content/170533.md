# IMPROVED HIGH TEMPERATURE PLASTIC SCINTILLATORS

## Abstract
A plastic scintillator comprises a polymethylpentene thermoplastic material containing a fluorescent additive. This plastic scintillator material functions at high tempera tures with excellent optical properties in the detection of neutrons. The plastic scintillator may also include an energy transfer compound, a wavelength shifter, a solubility enhan cer for the polymethylpentene and a decolorizing agent.
