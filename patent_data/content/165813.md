# TESTING STATION

## Abstract
A station for testing one or more electric conductors 8 covered in insulating material 9 includes one or more contact probes 14 movable to pierce the insulation and contact the conductors 8 . Additionally one or more contact pins 12 , resiliently mounted in a mounting 11 are movable to engage and electrically connect with the exposed conduc tors 8 at one free end of the cable. A voltage set up between the contact probes 14 and the one or more contact pins 12 provides an indication of whether the or each probe has made an electrical connection with its respective conductor. The probes 14 are circular with a circumferential cuiting edge 15 . They may conveniently be moved to pierce the insulating material 9 by rotation of their mounting 16 about the axis of the conductor under the action of a cam follower 17 on a cam profile 18 .
