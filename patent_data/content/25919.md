# A process for preferentially removing more planar molecules from mixtures with less planar molecules.

## Abstract
In a process for preferentially removing more planar molecules, such as divinylbenzene or para dioxin molecules, from mixtures of more planar and less planar molecules, such as commercial divinylbenzenes containing non planar ethyl vinylbenzene, or commercial 2,4,5 T herbicide containing non planar 2,4,5 trichlorophenoxiacetic acid the mixture is contacted with particulate adsorbent which is the product of controlled thermal degradation at a temperature of at least 500 C of macroporous synthetic polymer containing mancro pores in the range 50 to 100,000 Angstroms in average critical dimension and a carbon fixing moiety and derived from one or more ethylenically unsaturated monomers, or monomers which can be condensed to yield macroporous polymers, or mixtures thereof, until planar molecules have been selectively adsorbed, and subsequently separating the adsorbent from the mixture Suitable adsorbents are disclosed in detail in U.S. Patent 4040900 and British Patent 1543376.
