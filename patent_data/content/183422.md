# Offset three gear, two system pump.

## Abstract
An offset three gear, two system pump 10a includes first 14a , second 20a , and third 24a overlapping cham bers. First inlet 46a and low pressure outlet ports 48a communicate with the first and second chamers, and second inlet 50a and high pressure outlet ports 52a communicate with the first and third chambers. The first chamber has a short wall portion 16a extending from the low pressure outlet port to the second inlet port, and a long wall portion extending from the high pressure outlet port to the first inlet port. First 28a , second 34a , and third 40a gears are respectively rotatable in the chambers. The first and second gears form a low pressure gear set, and the first and third gears form a high pressure gear set. A small number of first gear teeth are cooperable with the short wall portion and a large number of first gear teeth are cooperable with the long wall portion to effect sealing against leakage from the pressure ports to the inlet ports.
