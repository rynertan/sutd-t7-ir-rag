# Electrical connector assembly having means for shielding electromagnetic interference.

## Abstract
A closed, radially contractible, metallic annular spring band 20 is radially interposed between mating plug and re ceptacle shells 10, 40 to shield electromagnetic signals from entering or leaving the assembly, the plug shell 10 including an annular groove 14 circumposed by annular lips 16, 18 which define annular undercuts 17, 19 therearound to receive and captivate the spring band contracted therein. The spring band includes flat margins 22 which extend into the under cuts, an arcuate section 24 between the margins having an arcuate cross section which extends radially upward from the annular groove a distance sufficient to be compressed by the receptacle shell during mating, and a plurality of alternating slots 26 opening along opposite edges 21, 23 thereof to de fine alternating segments 28 which overlappingly fold over one on to the other to close the slots 26 when the band 20 is contracted, the band unitially being of greater diameter than the plug 10 and the arcuate section 24 being adapted to ra dially flatten during mating.
