# Method and appartus for delivering a predetermined amount of material to a container.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus 30 for delivering a predeter mined amount of material into a predetermined position on each of a series of moving trays while avoiding spillage of the product onto other portions of the trays. A conveyor 35 lifts the material onto a shaker pan 34 which delivers the material in an even flow on to a rotating turntable 31 having a plurality of radially extending gutters 31c thereon. The turntable directs the material to flow along the gutters and into a plurality of hoppers 32 disposed at the periphery of the turntable. Once a hopper is full, any excess material falls onto a drip tray 33 which returns the material back to a supply bin. The filled hoppers are sequentially rotated above trays 39, which are moving on a conveyor 37, to release the material onto a predetermined area of each successive tray. A funnel 76, 132 disposed between the hopper and the tray facilitates delivery of material onto the tray. The funnel 132 is lowered toward the tray to deliver material, advanced in synchronism with the tray, elevated to clear the tray and material, and then returned to its initial position.
