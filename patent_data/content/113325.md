# Solar collector.

## Abstract
A solar collector of the so called flat surface type is described in which the thermal component of the solar radiation is trapped in a chamber formed between two opposing glass sheets and is reflected between them until exhaustion. One sheet is transparent to infra red radiation 8000 ANGSTROM and the other is transparent to ultra violet radiation 4000 ANGSTROM the latter sheet has a mirrored surface outside the chamber for reflecting the radiation. When the two sheets are spaced apart by a multiple of 8000 ANGSTROM an aerial effect is achieved within the chamber defined thereby, which increases the thermal yield of the solar collector.

## Description
Solar CollectorThe present invention relates to a soar collector of the so called fAat surface type supported by a surrounding frame, in which the absorbec solar radiation is converted into hcat by hefting water or some other fluid Passing through a plurality of tubes carried by the frame.It is well known that solar collectors have the function of picking up solar radiation for transfer of the absorbed heat content to a fluid, usually water, whereby the hent may be accuaulated and transferred to a utilise.In order to obtain the best yield, it is necessary for a solar collector to be able to pick up the maximum solar radiation available and prevent any heat loss to the exterior either by convection or radiation.In almost all cases the solar collectors made until now have included a support frame which is essentially rectangular, a glass covering sheet, and an absorbent plate generally of aluminium, in which are formed ducts for the fluid water for absorbing the collected heat and transferring the heat to the utiliser. The glass sheet and the absorbent plate are supported around their peripheries by the frame and define a sealed space between them.The plate is generally coated with a special black varnish.In these collectors, the heat in the solar radiation picked up is absorbed by a technique based on the so called greenhouse effect . For this purpose, a glass sheet of suitable thickness is used, the function of which is essentially that of limiting the heat losses by convection and radiation, given that the glass is opaque to infra red which is precisely the field of the radiation emitted by the absorbent plate or tube bundle at its normal working temperature.Solar collectors of this type, although becoming ever more widely used in various fields, have recognised technical disadvantages which have not nreviously been overcome.Indeed, it is known that the therma yield of such solar collectors falls rapidly as the temperature of the absorbent plate increases, and that the temperatures at which the yield is negligible are reached rapidly because of the very greenhouse effect which is sought.Moreover, the glass sheet which is itself used to achieve the desired commat greenhouse effect by preventing heat losses by radiation from the absorbent plate to the exterior of the panel is opaque to infra red radiation which is well known to be the solar radiation having the greatest heat content. Consequently, the collectors of the prior art do not make use of this type of solar radiation, so that their usefulness is limited to daytime when visible radiation light is present and they are not able to operate satisfactorily under an overcast sky or in fog. The use of solar collectors of the prior art is thus severely limited.The problem behind this invention is that of providing a solar collector having structural and functional characteristics such as to overcome definitively the disadvantages mentioned above.This problem is solved according to the invention by a solar collector of the so called flat surface type, which includes a surrounding frame and is characterised in that it comprises a sheet transparent to a part of the solar radiation having a wavelength between at least 6800 and 8000 A, the sheet being supported around its periphery by the frame, a wall having a surface which reflects solar radiation having at least the said wavelength, the wall being supported around its periphery by the frame paralle3 to and spaced from the transparent sheet, and the reflective surface of the wa31 facing the transparent sheet, a chamber formed between the transparent sheet and the wall, and a plurality of ducts supported in the chamber in a mutually spaced relationship and terminating at respective inlet and outlet headers for water or other fluid.To advantage and in accordance with a preferred embodiment, the sheet is transparent to 80Xb of the solar radiation having a wavelength between at least 6800 and 80co A.In accordance with a further embodiment, a solar collector according to the invention is characterised in that it comprises a first sheet transparent to a part of the solar radiation having a wavelength between at least 6800 and 8000 and supported around its periphery by the frame, a second sheet transparent to a part of the solar radiation having a wavelength between at least 3500 A0 and 4000 A and supported around its periphery by the frame parallel to and spaced from the first sheet, a chamber formed between the first and second sheets, a plurality of ducts supported within the chamber in a mutually spaced relationship and terminating at respective inlet and outlet headers for water or other fluid, and a wall having a surface which reflects at least the said solar radiations, the wall being supported in the frame outside the chamber in substantial contact with one of the sheets, and the reflective surface of the wall facing the other of the sheets.To advantage, the first sheet is transparent to 80 of the solar radiation having a wavelength of 8000 A, the second sheet is transparent to 85 of the solar radiation having a wavelength of 4000 A, and the distance of the sheets from the reflective surface of the wall is a whole multiple of 8000 A. Contrary to what occurs in solar collectors of the known type, in which the exploitation of the thermal component of the solar radiation is based on the greenhouse effect , in a solar collector recording to thE Invention this exploitation is based on the trapping of a part of the eectrotnagnetic radiation corresponcing to the infra red 6800 to 8000 between the transparent plate and the reflective wall. Moreover, when the panel is of the type comprising two sheets transparent to the infra red and the ultra violet respectively, and when the distance between, for example, the sheet transparent to the infra red and the reflecting wall is a multiple of 800C , a sort of aerial effect for the electromagnetic 0 radiation of 4000 and 8000 A is added to the trapping of the thermal radiation.As a result of this, high temperatures are reached rapidly in the chamber between the sheets, which thus act as a resonance chamber with no deterioration in the thermal efficiency of the solar collector.Further characteristics and advantages of the invention will become clearer from the description of one embodiment of a solar collector according to the invention, which follows with reference to the appended drawings given purely by way of non limiting example, in which Figure 1 is a schematic perspective view of a solar collector according to the invention, with its parts separated Figure 2 is a schematic cross section of the solar collector ofFigure 1.With reference to the drawings, a solar collector according to the invention comprises a support frame 1 of substantially rectangular type, a first glass sheet 2 supported around its periphery in the frame 1 by known means,not shown, and a second glass sheet 3 also supported around its periphery in the frame 1, parable to and spaced from the glass sheet 2.The sheet 2 is of glass transparent to solar radiation having a wavelength between at least 6800 and 8000 , that is to say, transparent to the infra red. ore particularly and preferably, the glass sheet 2 is transparent to 80 of the solar radiation having this wavelength and, still more preferably, is transparent to 80 of the electromagnetic radiation having a wavelength of 8000 .Such a glass sheet is formed by conventional methods using well known compositions suitable for the purpose, that is to say, compositions including suitable quantities of one or more constituents chosen, for example, from silica, calcium oxide, magnesium oxide, alumina and the like.Alternatively, it may be constituted by ordinary glass having a film 10 of suitable plastics material, such as polymethyl methacrylate, polyester, polyethylene terephthalate, epoxide, polytetrafluoroethylene, polytrifluoromonochloroethylene, or polyvinyl chloride, which may be suitably coloured with appropriate pigments.The sheet 3 is of glass transparent to solar radiation having a 0 wavelength between at least 3500 and 4000 A. Preferably, the sheet is transparent to 85 of the solar radiation having this wavelength and, more preferably, is transparent to 85 of the solar radiation having a wavelength of 4000 A ultra violet .The sheets 2 and 3 together define, with the frame 1, a chamber 4 which is sealed from the exterior, in which is supported a plurality of tubular ducts 5. The tubular ducts 5 are mutually spaced by a predetermined distance and are connected at opposite ends to respective headers 6, 7 in communication with the exterior of the chamber 4 of the frame 1. he solar collector of the invention also nnludeE a wall P which is supported around its periphery in the frame 1 in substantial contact with one of the sheets 2, 3. Thi waq P hae a surface which reflects solar radiation of the said wavelengths 3500 4500 6800 8000 , the reflective surface facing the other glass sheet. The distance between the reflective surface 8 and the glass sheet 2 or 3 exposed to the solar radiation is a multiple of 8000 .If required, the solar collector so formed may be provided with a layer of thermally insulating material 11 of suitable thickness znd or possible accessories of the type already widely used in solar panels of the prior art.The solar collector of the invention may be used in two different arrangements, that is, with the sheet 2 facing the sun and the reflective surface 8 in contact with the sheet 3 and facing the sheet 2, or vice versa, with the sheet 3 facing the sun and the reflective surface 8 in contact with the set 2. Tn the first case radiation having a wavelength corresponding to the infra red about 8000 will mainly be picked up, trapped and best absorbed, while in the second case the radiation corresponding to the ultraviolet 4000 will be mainly picked up and trapped. It should be note that, in the first case, the infra red radiation can be picked up, trapped and absorbed in the fon of heat even when the sky is overcast or foggy, or even after sunset.About 20i of the infra red radiation incident on the sheet 2 is reflected, while 80 thereof passes into the chamber 4 and is reflected from the reflective surface 8. 80 of this reflected infra red radiation passes through the sheet 2 to the exterior of the collector, while 20 thereof is again directed at the reflective surface 8 and so on. This is the aforementioned reflective effect whereby the desired radiation with a high heat content is trapped With the resulting improved us oS the heat content of the soar radiation incident on the collector of the Invention. An aerial effect is added to this effect by a synergism which is not clearly explained, particularly when the distance between the sheet 2 or 3 and the reflective surface 8 is equal to a multipl of 8000 .It has been found from repeated and well controlled experiments thai a solar collector of the invention allows higher temperatures to be reached in shorter times than 2 collector of the prior art having the same exposed surface and water flow rate. It has also been found that the thermal yield of a collector of the invention is not reduced with an increase in the temperature but remains substantially constant when the temperature of the ducts 5 reaches values of the order of 80 to 83 C. It should be noted that the aeria effect disappears completely when the solar collector of the invention is made in a simplified version without the sheet 3 which is transparent to solar radiation of 3500 to 4000 A ultra violet .Finally, it has been found that the thermal yield of a solar collector of the invention can be further increased when the chamber 4 is evacuated to 20 of atmospheric pressure and atmospheric pressure is re established by the admission of a gaseous mixture constituted by xenon and neon, preferably in a 4 1 ratio.
