# MONITORING UNIT FOR THE SHAFT VOLTAGE OF A ROTARY ELECTRIC MACHINE.

## Abstract
A monitoring unit for detecting abnormalities generated in the shaft voltage of a rotary electric machine, e.g., a brushless synchronous machine. The monitoring unit in cludes a detector 16 for obtaining a voltage reading across at least two points on a rotor shaft 4 , another detector 17 for obtaining a voltage reading from the rotor shaft to ground, a detector 19 for detecting an electrical signal in the composing member of the field part of the rotary electric machine, and an abnormality detector 22 for generating an alarm signal in response to the detected signals in these detectors when the values of the amplitude and the frequen cy of the shaft voltage are abnormal.
