## Description
The present invention relates to a light signal transmission apparatus, and more particularly to a light signal transmission apparatus suitable for transmitting a transmission signal with a high precision. Generally, in order to avoid various adverse effects caused by noises in signal transmission, an optical data transmission using as a transmission line an optical fiber cable has been adopted as a countermeasure for such noises. In a light transmission, however, the amount of light emission from a light emission diode for converting an electrical signal into a light signal is under the influence of temperature as shown in Fig. 1. In particular, even if the current flowing into the light emission diode is maintained constant, the amount of light emission is decreased with the temperature rise. In order to compensate for this, a method shown in Fig. 2 has been adopted heretofore. This compensation method will briefly be described. An electrical analog signal applied to a terminal 1 is inputted to a driver circuit 2 of a transmitter 6. The driver circuit 2 adjusts the amplitude of the analog signal, and the adjusted signal is outputted to a light emission diode 3. Ordinarily, the light emission diode 3 is used in such a region as the input electrical signal and the light emission amount of the light emission diode 3 become proportionate with each other. In this manner, the light emission diode 3 converts the input electrical signal into a light signal. The converted light signal is transmitted through an optical fiber cable 5 to a receiver 10. In the receiver 10, the input light signal is converted at a light reception diode 7 into an electrical signal. The level of the electrical signal is converted at an amplifier circuit 8 to output an electrical analog signal at a terminal 9. However, in this case, the light emission diode 3 in the transmitter 6 is under the influence of temperature, as shown in Fig. 1. Thus, in order to compensate for such influence, a portion of the light signal transmitted from the light emission diode 3 to the optical fiber cable 5 is received at a monitoring light reception diode 4 to feedback the received light signal to the driver circuit 2, thereby controlling the driver signal to the driver circuit 2. In particular, as the light emission amount decreases with the temperature rise, an electrical signal or current supplied to the light emission diode 3 from the driver circuit 2 is rendered to increase owing to the above feedback effect, so that the light emission amount of the light emission diode 3 can always be maintained constant. If there is a temperature difference between the transmitter 6 and receiver 10, the difference however can not be compensated. The signal transmission apparatus, disclosed in the Official Gazette of Japanese Patent Application Laid open No. 56 54136, is an apparatus of the type that the temperature characteristics of the light emission and reception elements in the respective transmitter and receiver are retained equal to each other. Also in this case, if the temperatures of environmental atmospheres at the locations of the transmitter and receiver are different from each other, the error in the transmitted signal caused by the temperature difference can not be compensated. Alternatively, among those apparatuses as used at the location where the atmospheric temperature is subjected to an abrupt change, there is known in the art a signal transmission apparatus as disclosed in an Official Gazette of Japanese Patent Application Laid open No. 56 12143. In the apparatus, a signal to be transmitted is frequency converted and a first frequency signal having as a reference the center frequency of the frequency converted signal is transmitted via an optical fiber to the receiver. In addition, a second frequency signal which is the center frequency of the reference is transmitted via another optical fiber to the receiver. In this case, two light emission elements and two light reception elements respectively connected to the two different optical fibers must have the same temperature characteristics. However, light emission and reception elements with the same temperature characteristics require very cumbersome processes in manufacturing. In the document IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT, Vol. IM 24, No. 3, September 1975 a calibrator is disclosed which in a light transmission apparatus periodically transmits a pulse of known amplitude so as to determine the systems overall gain. Further, it is suggested to compensate within the receiver the reverse bias of the photodetector, which is assumed to be dependent from the temperature. In such a system neither the gain is adjusted nor is the overall system s bias determined and compensated. It is an object of the present invention to provide a light signal transmission apparatus which can improve the transmission precision of a signal with a simple construction. This object is solved in accordance with the features of the independent claim. Dependent claims are directed on preferred embodiments. A preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to Fig. 3. A transmitter 6 and a receiver 10 is coupled through an optical fiber cable 5. The transmitter 6 comprises a driver circuit 2, light emission diode 3, switch 11, and controller 37. The switch 11 has contacts 44, 45 and 46, and a movable contact 47. The contact 46 is connected to a terminal 1 serving as a signal input terminal for the transmitter 6. The contact 44 is grounded through a power source 12 for a reference voltage E₀.

The anode of the light reception diode 7 is connected to a resistor 100 and a resistor 20 in the amplifier circuit 8. The amplifier circuit 8 includes a switch 17, amplifier 21, and switch 24. The switch 17 has a movable contact 48 and other The filter circuit 25 is a high frequency cut circuit and comprises, for example, resistors 26 and 28, amplifier 27, and capacitor 29. The resistor 26 is connected to the negative terminal of the amplifier 27 of which the positive terminal is connected to ground. The resistor 28 and capacitor 29 are arranged in parallel, both being connected between the negative and output terminals of the amplifier 27. The output terminal of the amplifier 27 is coupled to a terminal 9. The arrangement of the pulse detection circuit 31 will be described with reference to Fig. 4. The pulse detection circuit 31 includes a pair of comparators 311 and 313. The negative terminal of the comparator 313 and the positive terminal of the comparator 311 are connected to the movable contact 49 of the switch 24. The negative terminal of the comparator 311 is grounded through a power source 312 having a reference voltage E 0 , while the positive terminal of the comparator 313 is grounded through a power source 314 having a reference voltage E 1 . Fig. 5 shows in detail the signal processor circuit 32. The signal processor circuit 32 comprises sample hold circuits 321 and 323, analog digital converters 322 and 324, and microprocessor 325. The sample hold circuit 321 is coupled to the output terminal of the comparator 311 of the pulse detection circuit 31 and to the output terminal of the dc amplifier 21 of the amplifier circuit 8. The sample hold circuit 323 is connected to the output terminal of the comparator 313 of the pulse detection circuit 31 and to the output terminal of the dc amplifier 21 of the amplifier circuit 8. The sample hold circuit 321 is connected to the microprocessor 325 through the analog digital converter 322, while the sample hold circuit 323 is connected to the microprocessor 325 through the analog digital converter 324. Fig. 6 shows a circuit arrangement of the abnormality detection circuit 40. The abnormality detection circuit 40 also includes a pair of comparators 402 and 404. The negative terminal of the comparator 404 and the positive terminal of the comparator 402 are coupled to the output terminal of the amplifier 21 of the amplifier circuit 8. The negative terminal of the comparator 402 is grounded through a power source 401 having a reference voltage E₂ , while the positive terminal of the comparator 404 is grounded through a power source 403 having a reference voltage E₃ . The values of the reference voltages are set as E₂ E₀ and E₃ E₁. The output terminal of the comparator 402 is connected to a terminal 41, while the output terminal of the comparator 404 is connected to a terminal 42. Next, the operation of the above embodiment will be described. An output signal for instance, an analog signal 50 of Fig. 7A from a detector not shown mounted at a plant is applied to the terminal 1. The controller 37 cyclically connects the movable contact 47 of the switch 11 to the contacts 46, 44, 45, and 46 in this order. It is noted here that the connection time periods while the movable contact 47 under control of the controller 37 is being connected to each contact are set as in the following for example. The time period while the movable contact 47 is connected to either the contact 44 or 45 is from several ns to several tens ns. The time period first time period during which the movable contact 47 becomes separated from the contact 44 and connected to the contact 45 is several µs. In addition, a time period second time period during which the movable contact 47 becomes separated from the contact 45 and thereafter connected to the contact 46 is, for example, from several tens sec. to several minutes. With such time periods, the movable contact 47 is controlled to connect to each contact of the switch 11. The second time period may be set to have a longer time period than that above described. In the case that the movable contact 47 is being connected to the contact 46, the analog signal electrical signal 50 shown in Fig. 7A and inputted to the terminal 1, is directly inputted to the amplifier 14. In the case that the movable contact 47 is being connected to the contact 44, instead of the analog signal 50 a signal P₀ corresponding to the reference voltage E₀ of the power source 12 is inputted to the amplifier 14. Alternatively, in the case that the movable contact 47 is being connected to the contact 45, instead of the analog signal 50 a signal P₁ corresponding to the reference voltage E₁ of the power source 13 is inputted to the amplifier 14. By controlling the contact state of the movable contact 47 by means of the controller 37 having the above described operational function, a signal 51 shown in Fig. 7B is derived out of the switch 11 and inputted to the amplifier 14. The signals P₀ P₁ become of a pulse shape as shown in Fig. 7B since the connection time periods of the movable contact 47 to the contacts 44 and 45 are very short. The signals P₀ and P₁ are herein referred to as reference pulse. The period of the respective reference pulses on the signal 51 is T. Pulses P₀ and P₁ of Fig. 7B are signals respectively coresponding to the power sources 12 and 13 and derived from the switch 11 prior to the pulses P₀ and P₁. Assuming that the maximum input range of the analog signal 50 is within V The output from the switch 11, or signal 51 voltage signal is subjected to a voltage current conversion at the driver circuit 2. The driver circuit 2 outputs to the light emission diode 3 a current signal corresponding to the signal 51. The light emission diode 3 is used in the range where the amount of light emission and its current are in proportion to each other, as shown in Fig. 8. I₀, I The light reception diode 7 converts the light signal passed through the optical fiber cable 5 into a corresponding current signal. With the current flowing through the light reception diode 7, a voltage signal generated in association with the resistor 100 is inputted through the resistor 20 to the dc amplifier 21. The output from the dc amplifier 21, or signal 30 is an inverted signal of the waveform of the signal 51, as shown in Fig. 7C. The signal 30 corresponds as described above, has an inverted sign to the signal 51 and includes the reference pulses P₀ and P₁, and so on. However, the voltages of the reference pulse signals P₀ and P₁ of the signal 30 are Y₀ and Y₁, respectively, which differ in magnitude from the voltages E₀ and E₁ of the reference pulse signals P₀ and P₁ of the signal 51. The reasons why the voltages for the reference pulse signals P₀ and P₁ differ at the sides of transmitter 6 and receiver 10 are attributable to the influences from the difference of atmospheric temperature conditions at the locations where the light emission and reception diodes 3 and 7 are mounted the change in aging of the light emission diode 3, optical fiber cable 5, and light reception diode 7 the difference of connection conditions among the light emission and reception diodes 3 and 7 and the optical fiber cable 5 and the like. The output of the amplifier 21, or signal 30 is transferred to the filter circuit 25, pulse detection circuit 31, signal processor 32, and abnormality detection circuit 40. The pulse detection circuit 31 is for detecting the reference pulses of the signal 30. The signal 30 has an inverted sign as of the signal 51, as shown in Fig. 7C. Therefore, in order to detect the reference pulses of the signal 30, the power sources 312 and 314 are so made to have negative values as described above. E₀ and E₁ are set so as to suffice the following conditions of the unequalities 1 . With E₀ and E₁ set as above, since the signal inputted to the terminal 1 does not exceed over the maximum input range, the pulse detection circuit 31 can always detect the reference pulses. As a result, the comparators 311 and 313 output signals 35 and 36 of a pulse shape, respectively, as shown in Fig. 7D and Fig. 7E. The signal 35 outputted from the pulse detection circuit 31 is inputted to the sample hold circuit 321 of the signal processor circuit 32, while the signal 36 is inputted to the sample hold circuit 323, respectively. The signal 30 is inputted to both sample hold circuits 321 and 323. The sample hold circuit 321 holds the level of the signal 30 inputted at the time when a pulse of the signal 35 is inputted, thus, the level Y₀ of the reference pulse signal P₀ of the signal 30 is held by the sample hold circuit 321. Alternatively, the sample hold circuit 323 holds the level of the signal 30 inputted at the time when a pulse of the signal 36 is inputted, thus, the level Y₁ of the reference pulse signal P₁ of the signal 30 is held by the sample hold circuit 323. Here, the reference pulse signals of the signal 51 are not subjected to distortion in the waveforms due to the broad frequency band width of the optical fiber cable 5. Therefore, the waveforms of the reference pulse signals are inputted as they are to the sample hold circuits 321 and 323, causing no error in transferring signals. The levels Y₀, and Y₁ of the reference pulse signals P₀ and P₁ held with the sample hold circuits 321 and 323 are inputted to the analog digital convertors 322 and 324 and converted with the converters into digital signals 52A and 52B. These digital signals are fed into the microprocessor 325. The relation between E₀, E₁, Y₀, and Y₁ can be represented by the equations 2 . In the equations 2 , the values of Y₀ and Y₁ are shown using an absolute value. wherein The microprocessor 325 has the values of E₀ and E₁ in memory. The microprocessor is supplied with the signals 52A and 52B, i.e., the outputs from the analog digital converters 322 and 324, indicative of the levels of the reference pulse signals P₀ and P₁, and solves the values of As stated above, basing upon the reference pulse signals added onto the signal 50 transmitted from the transmitter 6, and basing upon the reference pulse signals of the signal 30 received at the receiver 10, selected are a suitable gain adjustment resistor and a bias adjustment resistor. Therefore, it is possible to make, with ease, the levels absolute values of the reference pulse signals P₀ and P₁ of the signal 30 coincide with the level absolute values of the reference pulse signals P₀ and P₁ of the signal 51. That is, the absolute values of the levels of the respective signals 30 and 51 become identical. Afterwards from that time, even if the atmospheric temperature conditions at the locations where the transmitter 6 and the receiver 10 are mounted happen to vary independently from each other, or even if the change in aging of the optical fiber cable 5 occurs, on all such occasions, by virtue of the operations of the pulse detection circuit 31, signal processor circuit 32, and switches 17 and 24, the absolute values of the levels of the signals 30 and 51 can be adjusted to become equal. The signal 30 corrected so as to have the same level absolute value of the signal 51 is inputted to the filter circuit 25. The filter circuit 25 is a high frequency cut circuit as above described so that the reference pulse signals P₀ and P₁ contained in the signal 30 are removed therefrom. Therefore, the identical analog signal to the signal 50 is outputted at the terminal 9. The output at the terminal 9, for example, is inputted to a central computer so as to use the output as data for the operations performed for monitoring or controlling. The abnormality detection circuit 40 outputs a signal from the terminal 41 or 42 to the computer, the signal being indicative of the abnormal state that the input signal 30 is either smaller than E₂ or larger than E₃. In this case, it means that the transmission apparatus is in an abnormal state. When the signal indicative of the abnormal state is inputted to the computer via the terminal 41 or 42, the signal outputted from the terminal 9 at that time is considered as abnormal and is interrupted to be inputted to the computer. As seen from the above description of the embodiment, basing upon the reference pulse signals contained in the signal transmitted from the transmitter and the reference pulse signals contained in the signal received with the receiver, the received signal is corrected. The temperature compensation for the change in the temperature difference between the atmospheric temperatures at the locations where the light emission and reception diodes are mounted the compensation for the change in aging of the light emission diode, optical fiber cable, and light reception diode and the compensation for the change in drift and bias of the electric circuits of the transmitter, can all be achieved. Therefore, in the present embodiment, the precision in signal transmission can be remarkably improved. Even if the temperature characteristics of the light emission and reception diodes are different, it is possible to obtain a high transmission precision. Furthermore, the circuit arrangement necessary for the compensation for the received signal is also very simple. In addition, the number of optical fiber cables required for the transmission of the signal from a one transmitter to a one receiver is single without necessitating another cable for transmitting a reference signal as in the case described in the Official Gazette of Japanese Patent Application Laid open No. 56 12143. Therefore, the transmission apparatus itself of the present embodiment is very simple in construction. Instead of the switches 17 and 24 described in the above embodiment, a function generator may be used which is separately supplied with the bias adjustment signal 34 and gain adjustment signal 33 to output definite bias and gain. In the Official Gazette of Japanese Patent Application Laid open No. 55 135441, another method is disclosed in which a dc reference signal is superposed upon an analog signal at the side of the transmitter, a dc component of the received signal at the side of the receiver is compared with another dc reference signal to thereby control the analog signal. This method is to superpose a dc reference signal and is not of the kind that two reference signals P₀ and P₁ as for the present invention are used. Therefore, the above equations 2 can not be solved. In particular, this known method can perform only a bias adjustment and differs from the method according to the present invention which makes it possible to carry out both gain and bias adjustments. The description will be given to the case that the above embodiment of Fig. 3 is applied to a nuclear reactor plant. In this case, respective detectors for detecting, such as pressure, temperature, flow rate, and the like are provided at the nuclear reactor. The transmitter 6 supplied with signals from such detectors is mounted at the working site where radioactivity is vigorous in the nuclear reactor house. The receiver 10 coupled to the optical fiber cable 5 is mounted at the central operation room where radioactivity is not active. A plurality of terminals 9 of the receiver 10 are connected to the central computer mounted at the central operation room, the computer executing calculations using the received signals. The calculated results serving as monitoring data are displayed on a control panel provided at the central operation room. Further, signals inputted from the control panel by the operator and the outputs from the computer are transmitted from the receiver 6 mounted at the central operation room to the receiver 10 mounted at the working site in the nuclear reactor house. The outputs from the receiver 10 are transferred to the control object equipments of the nuclear reactor plant so as to attain necessary controls. The temperature at the working site in the nuclear reactor house and the temperature at the central operation room differ from each other normally, the former is higher , and moreover the transmitter or receiver at the working site is under the influence of radioactive rays. Even in this case, according to the present embodiment, the received signal can be compensated at the receiver side as shown in the embodiment shown in Fig. 3. Although the embodiment shown in Fig. 3 has been directed to the analog signal transmission, the present invention is also readily applicable to the digital signal transmission. An embodiment applied to the digital signal transmission will be described with reference to Fig. 9. Only those portions different from the embodiment of Fig. 3 will be discussed. In the figures associated with the embodiment, identical constitutional elements have been designated with the same numbers as those of the first embodiment. A transmitter 6A comprises a driver circuit 2, light emission diode 3, switch 11, and controller 53. The transmitter 6A uses the controller 53 in place of the controller 37 of the transmitter 6. The controller 53, as shown particularly in Fig. 10 includes a comparator 57, reference timer 58, 2 bit counter 60, and pulse width adjustment circuit 62. A terminal 1 is connected to the negative terminal of the comparator 57 of which the positive terminal is grounded through a power source 56 having a reference voltage Es. The output terminal of the comparator 57 is connected to an AND gate 59. The output terminal of the AND gate 59 is coupled to the 2 bit counter 60. The reference timer 58 is coupled to the input terminal of the AND gate 59 and to a clear terminal 63 of the 2 bit counter 60. The 2 bit counter 60 is connected via an inverter 61 to another input terminal of the AND gate 59. The pulse width adjustment circuit 62 comprises a resistor 64, capacitor 65, inverter 66 and AND gate 67. The output terminal of the AND gate 59 is grounded via the resistor 64 and capacitor 65. In addition, the output terminal of the AND gate 59 is connected to one of the input terminals of the AND gate 67. The other of the input terminals of the AND gate 67 is connected to the resistor 64. The output from the pulse width adjustment circuit 62 of the controller 53, that is, the output signal 54 from the AND gate 67, becomes a change over control signal for a movable contact 47 of the switch 11. A receiver 10A includes a light reception diode 7, amplifier circuit 8, pulse detection circuit 31, signal processor circuit 32, abnormality detection circuit 40, discriminator circuit 68, and filter circuit 72. The receiver 10A is that in which the filter circuit 25 is replaced by the discriminator circuit 68 and the filter circuit 72 in the receiver 10. The discriminator circuit 68 includes a comparator 69. The negative terminal of the comparator 69 is coupled to the output terminal of a dc amplifier 21. The positive terminal of the comparator 69 is grounded through a power source 70 having a reference voltage E The terminal 1 is connected for example to a radioactive ray monitor mounted at a nuclear reactor plant. The transmitter 6A is disposed within a nuclear reactor house. Thus, a linear pulse signal 55 shown in Fig. 11 A is inputted to the terminal 1. The signal 55 is transferred to a contact 46 and inputted to the comparator 57 of the controller 53. The comparator 57 outputs a pulse while the level of the signal 55 becomes lower than the reference voltage E The 2 bit counter 60 counts its input signal while the input signal an output signal from the reference timer 58 to the clear terminal 63 is at a logic 1 , and resets its output while the input signal to the clear terminal 63 is at a logic 0 . Therefore, the 2 bit counter takes a count mode while the output signal from the reference timer 58 is 1 . Then, the 2 bit counter 60 outputs a logic 1 when it counted up two input signal pulses. As a result, the inverter 61 outputs a signal shown in Fig. 11 D . And so, the AND gate 59 outputs a signal shown in Fig. 11 E . Although the signal of Fig. 11 E may directly be transferred to the switch 11 in order to use the signal as a change over control signal of the movable contact 47, in order to apply the equations 2 the pulse width must be made narrower. To this end, the output from the AND gate 59, or signal shown in Fig. 11 E is inputted to the pulse width adjustment circuit 62. The pulse width is determined by the values of the resistor 64 and capacitor 65. The output from the pulse width adjustment circuit 62, i.e., signal 54 is shown in Fig. 11 F . The signal 54 is in the shape of a pair of pulses V₁ and V₂. The time duration between the pulses V₁ and V₂ is in the order of several ns to several hundreds ns. The signal 54 has such pairs of pulses V₁ and V₂ at a period of T. The switch 11 is supplied with the signal 54 and actuated in such a manner that the movable contact 47 is connected to a contact 44 for the input of the pulse V₁ of the signal 54 the movable contact 47 is connected to a contact 45 for the pulse V₂ and the movable contact is connected to the contact 46 for the portions other than the pulses V₁ and V₂ of the signal 54. Therefore, a signal 175 inputted to the driver circuit 2 becomes such a signal as the signal 55 with the reference pulse signals P₀ and P₁ injected, as shown in Fig. 11 G . The level of the reference pulse signal P₀ is E₀, while the level of the reference signal P₁ is E₁. The reference pulse signal P₀ is smaller than the minimum input value V The signal 55 is converted at the light reception diode 7 into a current signal which in association with a resistor 100 is transformed into a voltage signal to be supplied to the dc amplifier 21. In the present embodiment, as similar to the embodiment of Fig. 3, the sign of the signal 175 is inverted at the dc amplifier 21 and the inverted signal is outputted therefrom the output signal corresponds to a signal 76 . The levels of the reference pulse signals P₀ and P₁ of the output signal from the dc amplifier 21 are assumed to take Y₀ and Y₁ as is similar for the embodiment of Fig. 3. The pulse detection circuit 31 is supplied with the output, i.e., signal 76, from the dc amplifier 21, so that a comparator 311 outputs a signal 35 Fig. 11 H corresponding to the reference pulse signal P₀ and a comparator 313 outputs a signal 36 Fig. 11 I corresponding to the reference pulse signal P₁, respectively. The signal processor circuit 32 has the same function as of the signal processor circuit 32 of the embodiment of Fig. 3. The signal processor circuit 32 is supplied with the signals 35 and 36 and a microprocessor 325 functions to solve the constant The compensated signal 76 of Fig. 12 A is inputted to the discriminator circuit 68. The discriminator circuit 68 detects the pulses of the signal 76 having lower values because of the inverted signal than the reference level E Also, in the above embodiment, similar effects to those for the previous embodiment can be obtained. In addition, a linear pulse signal can be transmitted with a good precision. According to the present invention, the possible influences from the temperature difference between the atmospheres at the locations where the receiver and transmitter are respectively mounted and from the change in aging of transmission paths, can be compensated with a simple apparatus, and the transmission precision can remarkably be improved.
