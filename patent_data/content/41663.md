# Bag closure.

## Abstract
Several unique bag closure features are presented, with one embodiment having a bag neck confining opening 16 provided with inwardly depending appendages 18 peripherally spaced from one another and with blunted ends 20 to protect the bag, but with sharp corners 22 to hold the bag. Another feature of the invention is a perforated plastic bag closure, with the perforations being arranged in a unique pattern to maximize the strength of the closure while reducing its weight. A third feature is a plurality of interconnected, flat, generally rigid closures which are joined in an elongated strip by sets of transversely spaced but outwardly, generally con vex webs which space the adjoined, adjacent closures from one another yet leave a smooth web when the closures are separated by breaking the webs.
