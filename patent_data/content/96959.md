# Microwave antenna assemblies.

## Abstract
A parabolic, collapsible rooftop microwave antenna 12, 13 for direct satellite to consumer TV transmission pivots in the direction of the aperture axis about a horizontal pivot axis 29 a, b in response to excessive wind forces. The antenna has a cross head theodolite type mount 28 adjustable for az imuth and elevation, with a horizontal pivot that provides axial displacement if the axial wind force exceeds a predetermined threshold force. This limits the torque transmitted to the roof on which the antenna is mounted to a reasonably low level. Var ious torquesensitive horizontal pivots are described including a torqued pivot bolt, torqued slide bolts 43a, b disposed in ar cuate slots 42 for limit stop action, shear pins for quick re lease action, and biased springs for collapse and self restora tion to the initial vertical position in response to transient wind force exceeding a threshold force set by the spring bias.
