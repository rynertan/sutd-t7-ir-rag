# Insulation anchor.

## Abstract
A system for insulating the walls of furnaces and other heated structures with ceramic fiber insulation including an improved insulation anchor. The anchor includes a pin 12 which is attached to the furnace wall 10 such as by stud welding 11 with the pin having an elongated aperture 14 at its outer end. A retaining rod 16 extends through the aperture 14 and into the adjacent ceramic fiber modules 24 . The rectangular shaped rod 16 includes an improved means 26 for locking the rod 16 in the aperture 14 which comprises a crimp at about the mid point of the rod 16 . This provides a narrow section of the rod which permits the rod to be turned in the aperture and locked. The crimp method of forming the narrow section does not remove any metal from the rod and does not weaken the rod.
