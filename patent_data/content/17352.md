## Description
CHROMANONE DERIVATIVES, A PROCESS FOR THEIR PREPARATION AND COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THEM This invention relates to chromanone derivatives, a process for the preparation, compositions containing them. U.K. Patent No. 1,357,633 discloses that compounds such as those of the formula I EMI1.1 wherein A1 and A2 are lower alkyl groups which may be linked possess mood modifying activity. It has now been found that if the CH2CH2NA1A2 moiety is replaced by a hydroxypropyl substituted piperazine moiety then the resulting compounds possess a completely different type of activity, namely antihypertensive activity. Accordingly, the present invention provides compounds of the formula II EMI2.1 and pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof wherein Ar is a pyrimidyl, pyridyl or optionally sub stituted phenyl group of the sub formula C6H3R1R2 wherein P1 is a hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine or bromine atom or a lower alkyl, lower alkoxyl, lower acyl, lower acyloxyl or lower alkoxycarbonyl group and R2 is a hydrogen, fluorine or chlorine atom or a lower alkyl or lower alkoxyl group. Within the compounds of formula II , there is a group of compounds of formula IIA EMI2.2 and pharmaceuticallly acceptable acid addition salts thereof wherein Arl is a pyrimidyl group. Suitably in formula IIA Ar is 2 pyrimidyl. Within the compounds of ofrmula II , there is also a group of compounds of formula IIB EMI3.1 and pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof wherein Ar is a pyridyl or optionally substituted phenyl group of the sub formula C6H3R1R2 wherein R1 is a hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine or bromine atom or a lower alkyl, lower alkoxyl, lower acyl, lower acyloxyl or lower alkoxycarbonyl group and R2 is a hydrogen, fluorine or chlorine atom or a lower alkyl or lower alkoxyl group. When used herein the term lower means that the group contains not more than 3 carbon atoms. When used herein the term acyl means unsubstituted carboxylic acyl. Suitably At is a pyridyl group such as the 2 pyridyl group. Aptly At is an optionally substituted phenyl group. Often when Ar is C6H3R1R2 the group R1 will be hydrogen. Suitably in such cases R2 is ortho to the point of attachment of the phenyl ring to the piperazine. A particularly suitable value for R 1 and R2 is hydrogen and alkoxy respectively. In such cases R2 is preferably methoxy, most preferably ortho methoxy. From the aforesaid it will be appreciated that one sub group of compounds of interest within formula lIB is of formula III EMI4.1 and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. In formula III the pyridyl group is preferably 2 pyridyl. A second sub group of interest is of formula IV EMI4.2 wherein R1 and R2 are as defined, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Aptly in formula IV R1 is hydrogen Suitable and preferred examples of R2 in formula IV are as hereinbefore described in relation to formula II . One group of compounds within formula IV is of formula V EMI5.1 and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof wherein R1 is as defined in relation to formula II . A particularly suitable value for R1 in relation to formula V is the hydrogen atom. The compounds of the invention are most suitably provided in the form of an acid addition salt with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid. Such salts may be mono acid addition salts or more conveniently di acid addition salts. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable acids include inorganic and organic acids such as hydrochloric, phosphoric, sulphuric, methane sulphonic acetic , propionic, citric, lactic, succinic, glyconic and the like. Favoured salts include the hydrochloride salts such as the di hydrochloride salt. Salts of the compounds of the formula II are generally more suitable than the corresponding free base on account of their crystalline nature which renders them of improved stability. The compounds of this invention may be provided in the form of solvates such as hydrates. The compounds of this invention may be made and used as a single optical isomer or as a mixture of optical isomers such as a racemic mixture. The present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition which comprises a compound of this invention as hereinbefore described together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The compositions of this invention may be adapted for administration by injection if required but it is normally preferred that they are in a form suitable for oral administration. Oral dosage forms may contain such conventional excipients such as fillers, lubricants, disintegrants, binders, preservatives, colourants and so on. Suitable fillers include lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, calcium phosphate, manitol and the like.Suitable lubricants include magnesium stearate and stearic acid. Suitable disintegrants include polyvinylpolypyrrolidone and sodium starch glycollate. The oral dosage forms are normally provided as discrete forms such as tablets and capsules. In general such unit doage forms will contain from 5 to 500 mg and more usually from 25 to 300 mg. These unit dosage forms may be administered from 1 to 6 times daily in such a way that the daily dose for a 70 kg adult will normally be between 30 to 1,500 mg and more usually from 100 to 1,000 mg, for example from 200 to 800 mg. In another aspect this invention provides a process for the preparation of a compound of this invention which process comprises the reaction of 1,2 epoxy 3 2, 2 dimethylchroman 4 on 7 yl oxypropane with a compound of the formula VI EMI7.1 wherein Ar is as defined in relation to formula II and thereafter reacting with an acid if an acid addition salt is required. The condensation reaction is normally carried out in a lower alkanol such as ethanol at an elevated temperature, for example under reflux. The crude compound of the formula II may be obtained by evaporation of the solvent. If desired this initial product may be purified by chromatography or other conventional methods but in general it is more convenient to convert the free base into a salt which may then be purified by crystallisation and recrystallisation. In general a di salt is preferred since it is more easily prepared by using a slight excess of the acid. Compounds prepared by this process are normally racemic. The racemic mixture may be resolved using an optically acitve acid in conventional manner, for example as in L.F. Fieser and M. Fieser, Organic Chemistry , 3rd Ed., 1956, Reinhold S.H. Wilen Tables of ResolvingAgents and Optical Resolutions , University of NotreDame Press, 1972, or S.H. Wilen, Topics in Stereochemistry 1971, Vol 6, John Wiley, NY.
