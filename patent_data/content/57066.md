# Process for the production of ethylene oxide.

## Abstract
Ethylene is oxidised to ethylene oxide over a silver containing catalyst which is promoted by high concentra tions of potassium, rubidium or cesium, in the presence of a chlorine containing reaction inhibitor and at least 5,000 moles of ethane per mole of inhibitor expressed as its vinyl chloride equivalent. Permanent absorption of chlorine onto the catalyst which leads to catalyst decay is low in this process.

## Description
Process for the production of Ethylene Oxide THIS INVENTION relates to a process for the production of ethylene oxide. Ethylene oxide is conventionally produced by contacting ethylene and oxygen with a supported silver catalyst in the presence of a chlorine containing reaction inhibitor or modifier which is present in the gas phase.The inhibitor or modifier is normally ethylene dichloride and or vinyl chloride and its function is to increase the selectivity of the reaction ie to increase the number of moles of ethylene oxide produced per hundred mole s of ethylene consumed . This reduces the activity of the catalyst the reduction in activity does however reduce the danger of hot spots in catalyst beds. We have found that in certain attractive catalysts chlorine is permanently absorbed from the modifier on to the catalyst bed and this gives rise to accelerated decay of the catalysts performance. We have devised conditions under which absorption of this type may be reduced to an acceptable level. The invention comprises a process of producing ethylene oxide by contacting ethylene with oxygen in the presence of a chlorine containing reaction inhibitor and a silver containing catalyst which is promoted with potassium, rubidium and or cesium characterised in that ethane is present in a ratio of at least 5,000, preferably at least 8,000, and more preferably at least 10,000, to 100,000 moles per mole of reaction inhibitor expressed as its vinyl chloride equivalent and that the potassium, rubidium and or cesium content is at least 5 x 10 6 and preferably more than 8 x 10 6 and suitably at most 25 x 10 gram atoms per gram of catalyst in a form which is extractable by contact with dilute nitric acid. The promoter is preferably cesium. Chlorine containing reaction inhibitors are of different effectiveness according to their chemical structure. We have found that 0.5 moles of ethylene dichloride, 2 moles of ethyl chloride and 12 moles of methyl chloride are equivalent to one mole of vinyl chloride. The effectiveness of other chlorine containing compounds may readily be determined empirically. By the vinyl chloride equivalent of the reaction inhibitor we mean the amount of the inhibitor necessary to produce the same inhibition as is produced by one mole of vinyl chloride The process is suitably carried out in a fixed bed of catalyst which may be contained in the tubes of a multi tubular reactor.The chemical composition of the reaction inhibitor tends to change as it passes through the catalyst bed at least in part because of lay down and removal of chlorine from the catalyst and consequently the vinyl chloride equivalent of the inhibitor may vary along the bed. If gases containing reaction inhibitor are recycled to the reactor the composition of the reaction inhibitor will tend to approach an equilibrium but if newly fed inhibitor does not correspond to that equilibrium the vinyl chloride equivalent of inhibitor may still vary along the bed. For this and other reasons it may be desirable to have catalyst with different promoter contents at the inlet and outlet ends of the bed as high levels of alkali metal tend to lead to increased permanent absorption of chlorine into the catalyst.If the reaction inhibitor is methyl chloride for example a higher alkali metal content will be desirable at the inlet end of the bed than at the outlet end of the bed because methyl chloride is comparatively ineffective as a chlorine donator, whereas if ethylene dichloride or vinyl chloride are fed as the reaction inhibitor it may be desirable to have a reduced alkali metal content at the inlet to the bed. The amounts of reaction inhibitor and ethane specified in this invention are those fed to the inlet of the catalyst bed however. The catalyst comprises silver, suitably supported on a porous heat resisting support which may have a specific surface area in the range 0.05 to 10 m2 g preferably 1 to 5 m2 g and more preferably 1.5 to 5 m2 g as measured by the Brunauer Emmett and Teller method, the catalyst comprising the promoting amount of potassium, rubidium and or cesium, in excess of any present in the support as impurities or cements. The silver may be introduced to a preformed porous heat resisting support as a suspension of silver or silver oxide in a liquid medium for example water or by impregnation of the support with a solution of a silver compound, for example silver nitrate, which can be reduced to silver metal. If necessary a reducing agent, for example hydrogen, may be employed but a heat treatment may however suffice to decompose the silver compound to silver. Suitably the impregnating solution contains a reducing agent which may be for example an anion, for example a formate, acetate, propionate, lactate, oxalate or tartarate ion, of a silver compound in the solution.The reducing agent may be for example an aldehyde, for example formaldehyde or acetaldehyde or an alcohol preferably having 1 to 4 carbon atoms for example methanol or ethanol. The solution may be a solution in water and or an organic solvent, for example an aliphatic alcohol preferably having 1 to 4 carbon atoms a polyhydric alcohol for example ethylene glycol or glycerol a ketone for example acetone an ether for example dioxan or tetrahydrofuran a carboxylic acid for example acetic acid or preferably molten lactic acid which is preferably used in the presence of water and suitably in the presence of an oxidising agent for example H202 or an ester for example ethyl acetate or a nitrogen containing base for example pyridine or formamide. An organic solvent may function as a reducing agent and or complexing agent for the silver also. If the silver is introduced by impregnating a support with a solution of a decomposable silver compound it is preferred that ammonia and or a nitrogen containing base should be present. The nitrogen containing base suitably acts as a ligand maintaining the silver in solution for example it may be pyridine, acetonitrile, an amine, especially a primary or secondary amine having 1 6 carbon atoms, for example isopropylamine. Other suitable nitrogen containing bases include ammonia, hydroxylamine and alkanolamines for example ethanolamine, alkylene diamines having from 2 4 carbon atoms or polyamines containing at least three carbon atoms for example diethylenetriamine or amino ethers with at least one ether linkage and at least one primary or secondary amino group eg morpholine or amides for example formamide or dimethyl formamide.The nitrogen containing bases may be used alone or in admixture. They also act as reducing agents for the silver compound. Suitably the nitrogen containing base or bases are used together with water. Very suitably the solution comprises silver nitrate and a primary or secondary diamine having 1 to 6 carbon atoms for example isopropylamine and water. Alternatively the solution may be a neutral or acid solution for example it may be a solution of a silver carboxylate especially a formate, acetate, propionate, oxalate, citrate, tartarate or preferably lactate or for example a solution of silver nitrate. The solutions preferably contain 3 50 of silver by weight. Impregnation may be carried out in a single stage or if desired may be repeated one or more times. By this means higher silver contents of the catalyst may be achieved. The silver compound may be decomposed for example in an atmosphere of air or preferably nitrogen. The silver compound may generally be partially or completely reduced to silver by heating in the range 100 to 3500C, for example for a period of 5 mins to 10 hours alternatively reduction may be carried out during the oxidation of the olefine to the olefine oxide. The catalyst support preferably has an apparent porosity as measured by the mercury absorption method of at least 20 , for example 30 80 preferably 30 65 and more preferably 35 65 and mean pore diameters of 0.1 to 20 microns preferably 0.3 to 4 microns as measured by the mercury porosimetry method. The pore size distribution of the support may be bimodal, in which case the smaller pores preferably account for at least 70 of the total pore volume and have a mean pore diameter preferably in the range of 0.1 and preferably 0.3 to 4 microns, and the larger pores preferably have a mean pore diameter in the range 25 to 500 microns. Most of the silver content of the catalyst is preferably present in the form of discrete particles adhering to the support having equivalent diameters of less than 10,0002 preferably in the range 20 10,000a and more preferably 40 8,0002 for example 100 5,0002. By equivalent diamter is meant the diameter of a hemisphere of the same silver content as the particle. Preferably at least 80 of the silver is present as particles having equivalent diameters in the aforesaid range, the quantity of silver being judged in terms of the number of particles falling in that range The silver is believed to be present largely as metallic silver. The dimensions of the silver particles may be determined by scanning electron microscopy. The support may be an alumina, silicon carbide, silica, zirconia, titania or silica alumina support, but it is preferably composed of an aggregate of alpha alumina particles which may be fused together or cemented together with, for example silica or baryta. The catalyst preferably comprises 3 to 50 and more preferably 3 to 30 for example 6 to 28 by weight of silver. The potassium, rubidium or cesium may be introduced to the support before, during or after the introduction of the silver compound. Preferably it is introduced to a support on which the silver is substantially present in metallic form. It is suitably introduced in solution in water and or organic solvents.If it is desired to impregnate a catalyst which has already been used in the oxidation of an alkene to an alkylene oxide and has lost performance, this may be carried out also. The potassium, rubidium and or cesium are preferably introduced as salts for example carbonates or carboxylates. Polycarboxylic acids and hydroxyacids are particularly suitable. An example of a particularly suitable acid is oxalic acid. Partial pressures of ethylene in processes according to the invention may be in the ranges 0.1 30 and preferably 1 to 30 bars. The total pressure may be in the range of from 1 to 100 and preferably 3 100 bars absolute. The molar ratio of oxygen to ethylene may be in the range 0.05 to 100. The partial pressure of oxygen may be in the range 0.01 and preferably 0.1 to 20 bars and preferably 1 10 bars. The oxygen may be supplied for example in the form of air or preferably as commercial oxygen. A diluent for example, helium, nitrogen, argon, carbon dioxide and or a lower paraffin other than ethane which is preferably methane may be present in proportions of 10 80 and preferably 40 70 by volume in total. The amount of ethane present is suitably in the range 0.2 to 10 and preferably 0.3 to 5 by volume of the gases fed to the reaction.Suitably the diluent comprises methane as aforesaid together with, for example 2,000 to 100,000 and preferably 5,000 to 80,000 parts per million by total volume of ethane, preferably together with small amounts, for example 10 to 10,000 parts per million by total volume of C3 to C6 alkanes, cycloalkanes or alkenes preferably propylene, cyclopropane, isobutene or isobutane. It is necessary to operate using gas compositions which.are outside the explosive limits. The temperature is suitably in the range 170 to 3200, preferably 180 to 3000C and more preferably in the range 190 to 2700C. Contact times should be sufficient to convert 0.5 70 , for example 2 to 20 and preferably 5 20 of the ethylene and unconverted ethylene is, after separation of the product, suitably recycled, optionally in the presence,of unconverted oxygen where appropriate and suitably after removal of CO2. The chlorine containing reaction modifier may be of known type. It is preferred that it should be aC1 to C10 compound also containing hydrogen. It may be for example 1,1 or preferably 1,2 dichlorethane but it is preferred to use vinyl chloride or more preferably methyl or ethyl chloride. Chlorinated aromatic compounds, for example chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene and chlorinated toluenes are also suitable. It is preferred that the concentration of the chlorine containing reaction modifier should be at least 0.1 and more preferably at least 0.2 and at most 450, more preferably at most 10 for example at most 3 parts per million by volume expressed as its vinyl chloride equivalent.EXAMPLE 1 The catalysts described in Examples 2 5 were prepared by the following method A solution of silver nitrate isopropylamine complex in water was prepared by adding isopropylamine 2.2 moles to an aqueous solution of silver nitrate 1 mole to produce a solution containing 430 g Ag l. The solution of the complex was used to impregnate an alumina support with a surface area of 2 m2 pore volume 0.38 cm3 g 1, mean pore diameter 0.8pm. After soaking for 15 mins the wet support was drained for 15 mins and then transferred to a pyrolysis unit. Pyrolysis was carried out in a stream of nitrogen for two hours at 900C, for three hours at 1550C and finally for one and a half hours at 2400C. The silver content of the finished catalyst was approximately 14 by weight. The cesium promoter was applied by soaking the catalyst for 15 mins in a solution of anhydrous Cs2CO3 in methanol 0.31 g per 100 ml . The excess solution was decanted and the wet catalyst drained for 15 mins before drying in a stream of nitrogen at 120 C for one hour. EXAMPLE 2 Two catalysts A and B containing approximately 1,000 parts per million by weight of cesium were prepared as in Example 1. The performance of catalysts A and B were determined as follows. 140 grams of catalyst in the form of 2 mm particles was loaded into an 11 mm internal diameter stainless steel reactor. A process gas containing 30 ethylene, 8 oxygen, 4 CO2, vinyl chloride, ethane and the remainder nitrogen was passed over the catalyst at a gas hourly space velocity of 3,760 her 1 and a pressure of 16 bars absolute. The reactor temperature was raised until an oxygen conversion of 40 was achieved.The catalyst selectivity at 40 oxygen conversion and the temperature required to achieve 40 oxygen conversion were recorded over a period of 90 days. The performances achieved using different levels of ethane are displayed inTable 1. The catalyst tested at 2.4 ethane displayed a stable selectivity and only a slow fall in activity. That tested at 0.6 ethane was initially more selective but selectivity and activity decreased rapidly with time. At this lower ethane level, catalyst A is not suitable for longer term operation at the indicated level of vinyl chloride.

In both cases the cesium promoter was added to the previously silvered support as a solution of Cs2 CO3 in methanol containing 0.32 and 0.37 g cesium 100 ml solvent respectively. Catalyst C contained 1180 ppm cesium and catalyst D contained 1250 ppm cesium by weight. The performances of catalyst C and D were determined using the same experimental procedure described in Example 2. Samples of catalyst C and D were tested in the presence of various levels of organochloro compounds and with various levels of ethane.The selectivities recorded at 40 oxygen conversion and the temperatures required to achieve 40 oxygen conversion at the end of the 14 days are presented in Table 3 together with the levels of organochloro compound and ethane used. After each test which lasted about 14 days, samples of catalyst.situ,ated at the front, middle and back of the catalyst bed were analysed for chloride level using neutron activation analysis. These data are also shown in Table 3. The results recorded at the end of the 14 day period show that the catalysts accumulate non uniform levels of chloride at low ratios of ethane to reaction inhibitor. The temperatures are also lower when feeding a high ratio of ethane to vinyl chloride equivalent. These tests wer too short to show the selectivity changes seen Example 2.

The Cs was addedas.Cs2 CO3. 140g of catalyst S in the form of 2 particles was loaded into a stainless steel reactor with an 11 mm internal diamteter. A process gas containing 30 ethylene, 8 oxygen, 4 CO2 3 6ppm methyl chloride, 0.6 ethane and the remainder nitrogen was passed over the catalyst at a gas hourly space velocity of 3760 hr Ú and at a pressure of 225 psig. The performance of this catalyst was monitored over a period of 28 days. The chloride level on the discharged catalyst was also determined as a function of the position in the bed using neutron activation analysis. The performances and chloride levels obtained are displayed in Table 7. Catalyst S was then replaced in the reactor with the front 20g replaced with 20g of catalyst T.

This catalyst was tested as described in Example 5. 0.4 g of catalyst were loaded into a 2 mm diameter tube, length 10 cm. A gas mixture containing 3096 ethylene, 8 oxygen, 4 carbon dioxide, 1.2 ppm vinyl chloride equivalents, 0.65 ethane and the remainder being nitrogen was passed over the catalyst at 16 bars pressure absolute, and the temperature adjusted to give an activity of 4 moles of ethylene converted kg catalyst hr and 40 conversion of oxygen. This required a temperature of 2000C at a selectivity of 75.5 . The levels of cesium and rubidium in the catalysts in the above Examples are the amounts extractable by contact with dilute nitric acid. In these Examples, parts per million ppm and percentages in the gas phase are by volume, and parts per million and percentages in catalysts are by weight. S40 is the selectivity expressed as moles of ethylene oxide produced per 100 moles of ethylene converted at an oxygen conversion of 40 and T40 is the temperature at which this occurred. Psig means pounds per square inch gauge. GHSV means gas hourly space velocity.
