# CLOTHES HANGER AND METHOD OF HANGING CLOTHES

## Abstract
A clothes hanger includes a resiliently deformable clamping member 2 movable from a normally compressed state to an expanded state in response to an expanding force to receive a rolled up article of clothing therein and for retaining the article of clothing in the rolled up condition in response to the removal of the expanding force. The clamping member 2 has a hook by which it may be hung on a bar.
