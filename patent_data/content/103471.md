# Debris collecting mechanism.

## Abstract
In a combination sweeping, polishing and scrubbing floor maintenance machine 10 , the present invention includes a debris hopper 24 84 removably positioned in a frame 21 secured to a portion of the machine 10 . The debris hopper 24 84 has a rearward opening 25 facing a pair of sub stantially side by side disc tools, e.g. brushes 20a, 20b 82, 83 . The brushes preferably rotate in the same rotational direction with one brush 20a 82 positioned slightly ahead of the other brush 20b 83 . Immediately in front of the forward edge of the leading brush 20a 82 is a conduit means 28 secured to the hopper 24 84 . Adjacent the conduit means 28 and extending along the hopper opening is a flexible member 32 . Both the flexible member 32 and the conduit means 28 serve as debris receiving means for directing swept debris upwardly into the debris hopper 24 84 . Blade mem bets 37, 38 may be provided forward of the debris receiving means and beneath the hopper 24, 84 to guide debris into a central area of the machine s path of travel. There may be more than one pair of brushes 120, 120a 121, 121a with a further brush 120b common to the pairs.
