# Power control circuit.

## Abstract
A bridge network 1 of current switching devices 2, 3, 4, 5 is operated in full wave manner by controlling signals A, B, C, D respectively produced by two similar, parallel and pulse width modulated power control circuits 12, 13 connected to re ceive a common input signal, one pair of opposing switch devices 2, 5 being controlled by one circuit 12 and the other pair 3, 4 being controlled by the other circuit 13. The pulse width control inputs 14 of the circuits 12, 13 are connected to voltage sensing means in the bridge supply circuit so that the pulse width of the control signals A, B, C, D is determined in accordance with the bridge supply level. The arrangement is such that the control circuits 12, 13 although not be designed to fail to safety standards operate in a fail safe manner to pro vide a constant level output of the input signal.
