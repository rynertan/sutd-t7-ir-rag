# Follower finger sheet separating apparatus.

## Abstract
A sheet stacking duplex tray 10 includes a movable finger 111 which separates a first group of sheets under the finger from a second group of sheets above the finger. Sheets which have been copied on only one side are fed to a copy station from the bottom of the tray for second side copying, as other sheets which have been copied on only one side are fed to the tray, to reside on top of the finger. When all sheets of the first group have been fed, the finger gravity falls through an opening 110 in the tray. A detector senses this finger movement, and a solenoid 12 then re sets the finger to rest on the top sheet of the sheets then in the tray.
