## Description
EPOXY POWDER COATING COMPOS IT IONS CONTAINING CALCIUM OXIDE This invention relates to epoxy powder coating compositions containing calcium oxide. Epoxy powder coating compositions are well known and widely used. Examples of such compositions are described in U.S. Patents 4,122,060 and 4,322,456. Calcium oxide has been used in various rubber and plastics compositions particularly to eliminate the porosity that. develops during vulcanization of rubber, for example. Hitherto, it has not been proposed to include calcium oxide in epoxy powder coating compositions. According to the present invention, there are provided heat curable epoxy powder coating compositions comprising epoxy resin and filler including calcium oxide in an amount sufficient to reduce foaming when the composition is heat cured. Substrates may be coated with such compositions by applying the composition to the substrate and fusing and curing the composition to a film. The presence of calcium oxide in the coating assists in reducing foaming which occurs on heat cure of known compositions not containing calcium oxide. Preferably, the calcium oxide is treated with a hydrophobic material to reduce hydrolysis. Typical hydrophobic agents include wax and oil. Treated calcium oxide suitable for use in this invention is commercially available. The amount of calcium oxide that is included in the composition is the amount that is sufficient to reduce foaming of the particular epoxy composition. Generally, that amount is from 1 to l by weight of the total composition, preferably from 2 to 84 by weight in certain applications, as little as 3S by weight has been found to be totally satisfactory. An essential component of the compositions of the invention is a solid epoxy resin. In general, any solid epoxy resin is suitable. Particularly preferred are epoxy resins which are the condensation products of bisphenol A and epichlorohydrin. Also suitable are epoxy novolac resins. One or more such epoxy resins can be used as well as epoxy resins of different chemical constitution. Preferably, the compositions of the invention include resinous curing agents which are reactive with epoxy resins. Suitable materials of this type include novolac resins and, in particular, polyhydric phenols suitable polyhydric phenols are described in U.S. Patent 4,322,456. Preferred polyhydric phenols include those materials described in U.S. Patent. 4,322,456 prepared by reacting an excess of bisphenol with a diglycidyl ether of bisphenol in the presence of a suitable catalyst, and resins obtained by reacting a bisphenol with an epoxy novolac resin. The compositions generally include catalysts in amounts from 0.001 to 10S and preferably from 0.05 to 5S by weight, based on the weight of the epoxy containing compound and the curing agent. Effective catalysts include phosphohium compounds and imidazoles as described in U.S. Patent 4,322,456, but any suitable catalyst can be used. Pigments, fillers, dyes, flow control agents and other additives can be included in the compositions of the invention. Typical fillers other than calcium oxide are barium sulfate, calcium silicate, calcium meta silicate, and calcium carbonate. Calcium oxide can be used as the only filler or can be used in conjunction with other fillers. The components of the composition are advantageously combined by melt blending, extruding the melt and pulverizing to achieve a powder with a particle size predominantly leis than 150 microns. Preferably, more than 9CK and most preferably more than 9 of the particles are smaller than 150 microns. Coatings are prepared from the compositions of the invention by applying the composition to a substrate and heating to effect curing. The substrate may be heated either before or after application of the powder coating composition. Typically in pipe coating applications for which the compositions of the invention are particularly suitable, the pipe is heated and the powder is applied to the heated pipe. Curing is conducted at temperatures sufficiently high to give reasonable cure times generally these temperatures are from 130 to 300 C. The thickness of the applied coating depends largely on the ultimate use of the coated article thicknesses are generally from 200 to 1000 microns and preferably from 300 to 500 microns. The invention is illustrated by the following Examples, in which all parts are by weight. EXAMPLE 1 This example illustrates a representative composition in accordance with the present invention. The following materials, except the silica, are melt blended and extruded at a temperature of 90 to 1000C, pulverized into a powder greater than 964 below 150 microns and the silica is dry blended with the powder.

EXAMPLE 2 The composition of Example 1 containing calcium oxide was compared to the Control without calcium oxide by coating the compositions onto metal and evaluating the coatings. t rolled steel was grit blasted, degreased and cleaned with acetone. The samples were preheated for 15 20 minutes at 2740C resulting in a 2460C metal temperature. The powders were coated to a film build of 300 4ao microns and postcured for 5 minutes at 2740C. The samples were evaluated for voids, impact, bend, hot water soak and cathodic disbondment and rated on a scale of 1 to 10 in which 10 is the best rating. Results are summarized in the Table below. Void ratings were made by visual microscopic examination.Impact and bend tests were in accordance with ASM methods. The hot water soak test was conducted by soaking the samples in water at 850C for 4 weeks and evaluating the samples weekly for changes in film and adhesion. Cathodic disbondment cell was according toBritish Gas Specification Cow6. Cathodic disbondment tank is an internal laboratory variation on the British Gas cell method in which multiple samples are tested at one time in a tank.
