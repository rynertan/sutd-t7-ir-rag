# Pneumatic radial tire.

## Abstract
A large size pneumatic radial tire for use on rough roads has as a tire reinforcement a carcass ply of cords arranged in a direction substantially perpendicular to the equatorial plane of the tire and a belt 1 composed of at least three cord layers each containing steel cords embedded parallel to each other in rubber and arranged at a relatively small angle with respect to the equatorial plane of the tire, at least one pair of adjacent cord layers among which being arranged one upon the other so that their cords cross with each other at an angle of 15 30 with respect to the equatorial plane. In this type of tire, the outermost cord layer a₄ of the belt is a cord layer formed by embedding a plurality of twisted steel cords, each having a single layer construction of 1 3, 1 4 or 1 5 or a double layer construction with a core of 1 to 2 filaments obtained by twisting a plurality of steel filaments shaped prior to the formation of the cord, in rubber at a cord volume fraction of 5 40 so as to provide a sealing type penetration form wherein a portion of the cord having an inner space completely filled with the penetrated rubber and a length l₁ is alternately connected with a portion of the cord having an inner space incompletely filled with the penetrated rubber and a length l₂ in the longitudinal direction of the cord so that l₂ is not more than 10 mm and l₁ l₂ is not less than 0.14.
