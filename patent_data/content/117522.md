# Azoic pigments having a silica core, process for production thereof, and a use thereof in a toner for electrophotography.

## Abstract
An azoic pigment having a silica core comprising a core of a fine powder of silica having a particle diameter of not more than 10 microns and a coating of a mono or polyazoic dye chemically bound to the surface of the silica core through an aminosilane coupling agent. The said organic pigment is useful as a coloring component of a toner for electrophotography.
