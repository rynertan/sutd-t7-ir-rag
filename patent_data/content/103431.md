# Improvements to fluid flow control.

## Abstract
A lubricating oil flow restricting valve for engine driven air compressor has an oil flow restriction 14 carried by a piston 6 with two interconnected pressure responsive areas 7, 8 communicating with an output port 4 and such that when oil pressure is applied to an input port 3 the piston is driven against a seat to close off a bypass path and leave a flow from the input port to the output port via the restriction.

## Claims
Claims 1. A fluid flow restricting valve having a restriction 14 in a flow path between an input port 3 and an output port 4 and characterised by a fluid pressure responsive member 6 having opposing differential pressure respon sivee areas 7, 8 connected via a passage 13 , the smaller area 8 being subject to pressure at the output port and the pressure responsive member acting in a sense to close Ã…a bypass path between said ports. 2. A fluid flow restricting valve as claimed.in claim 1 characterised by the pressure responsive member comprising a piston with a central stem the end of which carries the smaller area 8 , said stem also carrying said restriction in further passage 15 between said ar.eas and being moveable against a seat 17 to close the bypass path between said ports. 3. A.fluid flow restricting valve as claimed in claim 2 characterised by said passage 13 being formed in the pressure responsive member. 4. A fluid flow restricting valve as claimed in claims 2 or 3 characterised by a needle 19 moveable into the restriction upon movement of the piston in the direction to open the bypass . 5. An oil flow limiting valve substantially as described herein with reference to the single figure of the accompanying dra wing.

## Description
Improvements to Fluid r low Control This invention relates to fluid flow restricting especially but not excluqively to lubricant flow restrictingEMI1.1 tb valvestmachiles SEP . tb Engine driven air compressor employed on vehicles to charge reservoirs of braking systems are required. to operate over a wide range of temperature conditions and the. flow of oil from the engine oil pump to the bearings of such a machine can, therefore, vary between an excessively high value under hot running conditions when viscosity of the lubricant is low to near frost tempera ture.when running up from cold when the viscosity of the lubricant is high. Whilst it has been proposed furthermore to employ a simple choke restriction to limit hot oil flow to a compressor such a choke can also occassionally become blocked.The inventions provides a fluid flow restricting valve having a restriction in a flow path between an.input port and an output port and characterised by a fluid pressure responsive member having opposing differential pressure responsive areas connected via a passage, the smaller area being subject to pressure at the output port and the pressure responsive member actingcin a sense to close a bypass path between said ports.In order that the invention may be more clearly understood and readily carried into effect, the same. will be further described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawing which illustrates in sectional diagrammatic fgrm a lubric ant flow control valve assembly. Referring to the drawing, the assembly. comprises a generally cylindrical housing 1 with a top cover 2 attached by screws not shown and the housing having an input port 3 an output port 4 and a vent port 5. A fluid pressure responsive member in the form of a piston 6 has an. upper relatively large area. 7 bounded by an O . ring seal 12 and a lower relatively smaller area 8 bounded by a sliding 0 ring seal 10 on a central stem 11. A passage 13 extends between these two areas and a centrally disposed restriction 14 is provided in a further such passage 15, an annular upstand 17 being provided. in the lower part of the housing against which the area 8 is engageable around the restriction 14.Although not essential, in order to reduce the possibility of the restriction 14 becoming blocked, a small float 1.8 has a pin 19 which acts to clear the restriction each time the assembly moves upwards. In operation of the flow restricting valve it may be assumed to be connected in the oil. flow path between the oil pump of an engine and the lubrication channels of an air compressor driven by the engine. The oil flows in at port 3 from the oil pump and out at port 4 to the compressor bearings.. After stopping of the engine anX, subsequent cooling. from a heated condition, oil may tend to run away from the region facing area 7. Upon starting from cold oil. pressure acting via port 3 will act on the area 8.Since the viscosity,of the oil in passages 13and 15 creates a pressure difference across them they tend to inhibit initial flow to the area 7 and the pressure acting on 8 thus tends briefly to hold member 6 up whereby oil flow can take place from 3 via the bypass flo path pro.vided between 8 and. seat 17 to output port 4. This ensures immediate oil. flow to the bearings of the compressor on start up from cold.As the pressures quickly equalise on areas 7 and 8 and because area 7 is larger than area 8 the member 1. is driven downwards to engage the upstand 17 and the oil flow is then constrained to pass upwards through restriction 14 and passage 15 and downwards via passage 13 to port 4. This oil flow has the effect of moving the needle 19 out of the restriction 14.The size of restriction j4 is chosen suitably to limit to a minimum safe rate the flow of lubricant to the compressor whereby excessive oil is not allowed to reach the cylinder bores to be transmitted to the compressed air.The restriction 14 is cleared of any slight blockage by needle 19 each time the piston moves upwards. In the event of restriction 14 becoming temporary blocked moreo ver oil. flow is then permitted by the bypass action which will result. from the lifting pf the piston to allow some oil flow. to the bearings.but this oil flow would be less precisely metered than before. If the underside of the member 1 which is vented by passage 5 is arranged to communicate with the compressor sump or engine sump and the p.ston 6 is a good sliding fit in the bore of the housing 1 0 ring 12 may be dispensed with. Similarly, if the stem 11 is a reasonably good sliding fit the 0 ring 10 may be dispensed with. This may be readily brought about when integrating the valve ,assembly housing into the engine or compressor crankcase.
