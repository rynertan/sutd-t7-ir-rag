# Millimeter wave Frequency Multiplier.

## Abstract
A millimeter wave odd harmonic frequency multiplier comprises a block member 12 having an RF output port 30 and an RF input port 40 at right angles to one another with a pair of nonlinear resistance type diodes 56, 57 positioned at the intersection of the RF input port and the RF output port.
