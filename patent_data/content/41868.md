# System for processing video signals.

## Abstract
In a rotary head magnetic recording and reproducing system, the continuity of the horizontal synchronous signal is maintained by delaying the video signal for a predeter mined time and repeating said operation in each field, when in an abnormal reproducing mode in which the speed of the magnetic tape in the reproducing mode is different from the speed of the magnetic tape in the recording mode.
