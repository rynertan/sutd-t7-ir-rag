GEAR BOX ASSEMBLYFIELD OF INVENTION This invention relates to vertical axis wind turbines and components useful therefor, including, hydraulic suspension systems for supporting components of the vertical axis wind turbine, braking systems and an overspeed safety device.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION In co pending European patent application No. 82302631.5 there is described an improved gear box assembly for a vertical axis wind turbine, the vertical axis wind turbine having a rotor having a centrally disposed axis oriented in the vertical direction, a bull gear supporting the rotor, a base below the bull gear, the bull gear and base presenting a hollow housing and shaft terminating in an inner end wall and end surface respectively, the housing for receiving the shaft, one of said hollow housing or shaft being stationary and the other being rotatable with respect thereto and secured to the bull gear, the shaft and housing when secured together presenting a space between the inner end wall and end surface, bearings supported between the housing and shaft, a fluid passageway extending into the space created between the inner end wall and end surface for feeding hydraulic fluid under pressure into the space for hydraulically elevating the bull gear relative to the base, means precluding the gear from rising more than a predetermined distance or controlled distance, means for feeding the fluid under pressure to, and means draining the fluid from, the space, and reservoir for such fluid. While the aforesaid structure overcomes problems discussed in the said application, the present application deals with a more efficient approach to hydraulically supporting the bull gear, rotor and ouy wires of vertical axis wind turbines and particularly the bull gear, rotors and guy wires. Particularly, in the description of the embodiment of the invention disclosed in the aforesaid patent application, the rotor is wholly supported by the bull gear. Therefore, when the bull gear is hydraulically lifted and supported, the rotor is also lifted.In the larger wind turbines for example, wind turbines that generate greater than 1 3 megawatt the forces exerted between the end of the rotor and seat, and resultant wear and tear of the metal between the rotor and seat, increase dramatically thereby increasing the intervals between maintenance and decreasing the useful life expectancy of the wind turbine. Additionally, when the rotor of the vertical axis wind turbine is braked as described in the said co pending application, the guy tensioning ability of the wind turbine ceases. In the said co pending application, I also disclosed an emergency safety device for assisting to brake the wind turbine when the angular velocity of the rotor exceeded a predetermined velocity. In this regard, the opening of a normally closed valve leading from the space between the bull gear and shaft over which the bull gear rotated when elevated by the hydraulic fluid occurred when the weighted pendulum that rotated with the rotor reached a predetermined extended position when the angular velocity of the rotor exceeded a predetermined angular velocity. While this approach was an improvement to prior art approaches, its reliability to open at a predetermined angular velocity could not be assured because of for example, friction. It is therefore an object of this invention, to provide an improved vertical axis wind turbine and components therefor, including hydraulic suspension systems, braking system, and an overspeed safety device wholly reliable in emergency situations, and components therefor, which overcome the aforementioned deficiencies found in prior art structures. These improvements also include an improved hydraulic suspension system for hydraulically supporting the rotor shaft, bull gear and rotor shaft together and in some embodiments maintain the tension of the guy wires of the vertical axis wind turbines even when the bull gear has been braked, and more efficient components for these structures,and a reliable overspeed safety device which operates in emergency situations to effectively shut down the operation of the vertical axis wind turbine.

In the case of the rolling element which is more precise , as the angular velocity of the rotor increases, the centrifugal force increases tending to urge the element to roll up the inclined surface of the housing surface away from the rotor.However, the resultant is not sufficient to cause the element to roll up the incline of the housing until the rotor reaches a preaetermined angular velocity.At this point, the resultant force maae up of the gravitational force and centrifugal force is directed above the center of rotation of the rolling element when looking from the bottom of the tube or housing causing the rolling element to roll up the surface of the housing on which it lies to the upper end of the housing. A similar result is arrived at though less precisely, using a fluid .At that point, the force exerted by the element or fluid is sufficient to cause the housing to pivot causing the pivotal arm to pivot about the pivot point opening the passageway, releasing the fluid. Preferably, the rolling element sits on a hard steel plate in the housing to preclude the wearing away of the surface where it would normally seat precluding the creating of a rut in which the rolling element could become lodged. Therefore, the normally closed passageway is centrifugally opened by the overspeed safety device when the rotor exceeds a predetermined angular velocity. Activation is not dependent on weather conditions but only on the setting. Because there is little to wear out in the construction of the device, the safety device has a long, useful life and.provides substantially 100 reliability. Furthermore, because of its structure, it will not trip prematurely. Particularly, in a preferred embodiment employing a rolling element, nothing can happen to move the rolling element up the angled incline until the predetermined velocity is reached. Only then will it roll up the incline to the top end of the housing creating a large enough clockwise moment about the center of rotation causing the housing to pivot, thus pivoting the arm opening the passageway. The enclosure then collects the discharged fluid and directs it for reuse. Of broader scope, this invention also provides an overspeed safety device for ensuring the operational safety of a body rotating about in a vertically oriented axis which body for safety reasons should not exceed a predetermined angular velocity, the safety device comprising a housing or tube pivotable about a pivot point proximate a lower end of the tube, or housing, radially away from the center of the rotating body, the housing or the tube having a surface inclined radially upwardly away from the rotating body from the bottom to the top to support a rolling element or fluid thereon, which element or fluid moves radially to the upper end of the tube or housing, when the rotating body exceeds a predetermined angular velocity causing the tube to pivot about the pivot point, and means preferably ccnnected to the tube activated by the pivoting of the tube to operate in a predetermined manner, as for examples, a valve opened by the pivoting of the tube. According to another aspect of the invention, the rotor shaft is preferably tapered at the ends from a broader central portion. While any crosssectional shape of the rotor shaft is satisfactory symmetrically octagonal for example , it is preferable that the rotor shaft be circular in cross section. For ease of manufacture, it is preferable the rotor shaft be manufactured in two or more sections. Where two sections are employed, each section preferably comprises a broader end tapering to a narrower end. Annular flanges may extend radially or laterally of the section, from the broader end of each section for use in joining the sections together. The advantage of this configuration is that the wind loading under storm conditions is less. Additionally, because the rotor shaft of a vertical axis wind turbine can create aerodynamic interference with the blade passing behind the rotor shaft with respect to the wind direction, the use of the tapered shaft produces only a series of variable frequency vortices which provide less interference to the performance of the blade passing in the shadow of the rotor shaft than the vortices created by the constant diameter rotor. A further advantage is the cost of shipping the ability to carry two or more sections of the rotor by truck with the tapered end of one section next to the broader end of another section.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The invention will now be illustrated with reference to the following drawings of preferred embodiments of the invention, in which Figure 1 is a perspective view of a Darrieus vertical axis wind turbine incorporating prererred embodiments of the invention.

Four 4 guy wires shown as 38, 40, 42 and 44 are connected to, and support, wind turbine 30, through upper heaa assembly 46. The lower end of shaft 32 is secured for rotation in gear box assembly 50 See Figures 8, 9, and 1 mounted in tower 52. With reference to Figure 2, rotor shaft 32 has been replaced by shaft 321 tapered from a broader central portion at 52 to reduced end portions at 54 and 56. Shaft 321 is made up of two tapered sections 58 and 60 see also Figure 4 having angular flanges 61 extending radially from the sections at the broader ends 62 and 64 respectively for connecting the sections. Curved blades 34 and 36 are connected to shaft 32 proximate the ends in the same manner as in Figure Figures 6 and 7 illustrate two cross sections that shaft 32 may take. The circular cross section shown in Figure 6 is preferred to the octagonal cross section shown in Figure 7. Shaft 32 is preferred to shaft 32 in the construction of Darrieus vertical axis wind turbine 30. This is because constant diameter shaft 32 creates aerodynamic interference with eacn of the rotor blades 34 and 36 as each passes behind the rotor with respect to wind direction, reducing the efficiency of the rotor. The reason is the cumulative effect of the Von Karman vortex generation The Von Karman vortex generation caused by the rotor shaft in the windstream is a function of shaft diameter. Since the diameter of the shaft 32 is constant, the frequency of the on Karman vortices generated along the length of shaft 32 is constant, the vortices reinforce one another.The use of tapered shaft 321 tapering from a broader central portion to narrower ends produces a series of independent variable frequency vortices which are less disruptive to the performance of the blades passing in the shadow of the column. Figure 3 illustrates schematically the independent variable frequency vortices producea in the shadow of shaft 321. An additional benefit results from the use of two tapered sections 58 and 60 connectea to form shaft 32 . By producing tapered shaft 321 in two sections, they nay be shipped as shown in Figures 4 and 5. Particularly, highway regulations, regulate the maximum width of a vehicle and its capacity to carry oversized structures of large diameter. Where the load is oversized, special permits and or a police escort are required. Because the diameter of large constant diameter rotors in excess of 120 feet is about 5 , it is not ordinarily possible to ship the rotor in two sections loaded on one truck side by side.However, because the diameter of the section 58 and 60 taper from 5 to narrower 2 end portions, the sections may be shipped side by side as shown in Figure 5. With reference to Figures 8, 9 and 11, gear box assembly 50 is shown, incorporating a hydraulic suspension system for supporting rotor shaft 32 or 321 for simplifying description, rotor shaft 32 has been used and bull gear 70 for rotation, and, for tensioning and supporting guy wires 38, 40, 42, and 44, under a constant tension whether or not the bull gear and rotor are operational. Particularly, bull gear 70 has circular opening 72 at the top thereof surrounded by annular spherical bearing surface 74 for supporting the bottom surface 76 of shaft 32 proximate its radially outer bottom edge, shaft 32 seats in opening 32 on bearing surface 74 as shown. Bull gear 70 comprises a central hub 78 overlying end 80 of stationary shaft 82 of lesser diameter than hub 78 , shaft 82 being secured to base 84 above which bull gear 70 will rotate b bottom plate 86 secured to hub 78, c gear ring 88 secured to the periphery of bottom plate 86 and d triangular stiffening webs 90 secured between plates 86 and hub 78. Base 84 supports brake pads 92 proximate the periphery of plate D6 for seating on brake pads 92 when Darrieus vertical axis wind turbine is not operational. When plate 86 seats on brake pads 92, end surface 80 of shaft 82 is either spaced from the inner end of hub 78 or in contact with it. Hydrodynamic bearings not shown are secured between the inner side wall of hub 78 and the outer side surface of vertical shaft 32 for sealing the space created between the end 80 of shaft 82, inner end wall of hub 94 ana the bottom surface 72 of rotor shaft 32 when bull gear 70 is raised relative to shaft 82. Hub 78 and rotor shaft 32 are free to rise with respect to shaft 82 limited by guy wire reaction and the hydraulic fluid permitted to enter space 102 between the shaft, hub and rotor, to support the hub and rotor as described herein. Bull gear 70 meshes with pinion gear 96 coupled to generator 98 for driving generator 98. Annular dam wall 100 sits on base 84 and separates the interior space under gear 70 from generator 98 and the remainder of equipment not shown . Hub 70 and rotor shaft 32 are hydraulically supported with respect to stationary shaft 82 by hydraulic fluid fed into the space 102 created between the bottom surface 76 of rotor shaft 32, inner end 94, and end surface 80, as bull gear 70 and rotor 32 are elevated by fluid fed into space 102 from passageway 104 fed from reservoir 107 by hydraulic circuitry shown schematically in Figure 9. With reference to Figure 9, hydraulic fluid is fed into space 102 from reservoir 107 through passageway 104 by pump 110 operated by electric motor 112. Pump 114 operated on a common axis as pump 110 by motor 112 pumps fluid through passageway 116 to lubricate the gear pinion mesh. Fluid passing down from the lubrication of the gear 88 pinion 96 mesh is collected through passageways 118 and 120 by returns 122 and 124. Fluid is normally drained from space 102 by outlet port 106 of the same dimensions as passageway 104 througn drain passageway 108 in hubs 7 and returned to the reservoir 07 when bull ear 70 is elevated a predetermined distance above stationary shaft 82 exposing outlet port 106 to space 102.Therefore, gear 70 and rotor 32 cannot be elevated more than a predetermined distance because the feeding of hydraulic fluid into space 102 is maintained at a flow rate not to exceed the flow rate draining fluid through port 106 for return to reservoir 107. When bull gear 70 ana rotor shaft 32 are to be lifted hydraulically, fluid is pumped from reservoir 107 unaer pressure by pum 110 through passageway 20, 122 ana 104 into space 102 elevating both gear 70 ana rotor 32 enlarging space 02 comprising the volume between inner end wall 94 of hub 78, the bottom surface 76 of rotor shaft 32 and end surface 80 of shaft 82 as the fluid elevates bear 70 and rotor shaft 32. At the same time, fluid attempts to move through passageway 124 through valve 126.However, valve 126 electrically operatea two way direct pilot operated valve manufactured by Sperry wickers shown in crosssection in Figure 10 is normally closed and opens only upon electrical failure to the Darrieus vertical axis wind turbine 30. To this end, with reference toFigure 10, valve 126 is electrically powered to normally repel magnetic movable core 128 from stationary core 130 so long as electrically connected to â power source, compressing spring 132 of spring loaded sealing disc 134 to seal port 136 by stainless steel seat 138 .When the electric power is shut off in, for example, an electrical power failure to the wind turbine, the force of spring 132 forces core 128 away from sealing disc 134 releasing seat 138 opening com munication between the two ports 136 and 137 draining all fluid from space 102 through passageway 104 and outlet 140 to reservoir 107. In cases where the angular velocity of the rotor exceeds the prescribec maximum safe angular velocity, overspeed safety device 142 and associated components come into play. With reference to figures 9 and 16 to 21 inclusive, device 142 and associated components including passageway 144, leading from space 102 in rotor shaft 132 thrown branchea portion 146 5e device 142 are shown. Device 142 is secured by support bracket 145 to rotor 32 to rotate therewith, and is enclosed by housing 150 made up of reservoir 152 See Figure 16 and weighted closure 154. Oil return and hold down pipe 156 extends upwardly through the bottom 158 of reservoir 152 and is releasably secured to top 154 by threaded bolt 160 secured into threaded end of pipe 156. Washer 163 compressingly seals the opening in top 154 through which bolt 160 extends and gasket 164 is positioned between top 154 and the top of continuous wall 166 of reservoir 152 to seal the space in housing 150 against leakage between the reservoir 152 and top 54. Pipe 156 has been notched at 162 to permit oil to arain from reservoir 152 to the sump oil reservoir 107. Oil inlet 146 is secured to .metal tube 168 passing through top 154 SeeFigure 17 sealed by washer 1D5 and is closed by ball valve 170 supported on arm 172 to urge ball 170 to close tube 168 as shown in Figure 17. Arm 172 is in turn supported in pivotable upper valve lever arm 174 laterally pivotable in channel 180 of lower valve lever arm 182 with respect to arm 182. Channel 180 extends radially from rotor 32. Lower lever arm 182 is fixedly secured to rotatable shaft 184 See Figure 20 passing therethrough to rotate therewith radially away from rotor shaft 32 from the position shown in Figure 17. Shaft 184 is fixed for rotation in support 186 secured to top 154 .Shaft 184 is in turn fixed to hollow square tubing 188 comprising elongated rectangular walls 190, 192, 194 and 196 so that when tubing 188 rotates, shaft 184, and arm 182 all rotate together away from the rotor shaft 32. Stop bolts 198 and 200 are secured across the center of the open ends of tubing 188 for stopping metal ball 202 from passing through the ends. Plate 204 See Figures 18 and 21 is positioned on the inside surface of wall 192 proximate bolt 190. Tube 188 is secured to shaft 184 at an angle of to the vertical when ball valve 170 closes the opening 206 of inlet 168 sloping upwardly and radially outwardly from rotor shaft 32 looking from the bottom of tubing 188 to provide radially upwardly angles ramp 208 on the inside surface of wall 192. With reference to Figure 21, as the rotor rotates at a safe angular velocity, less than a predetermined given unsafe angular velocity, two forces are exerted on ball 202, gravity G and a centrifugal force C radially outwardly. The resultant R of the two forces does not cause the ba71 to move.However, as the angular velocity of the rotor increases, the Resultant R approaches a position normal N to the plate until at the predetermined angular velocity, the resultant R passes the normal N exerting a clockwise moment about the center of gravity on sphere 202 causing sphere 202 to roll up ramp 208 altering the center of gravity of tubing 188, causing tubing 188 to rotate radially away from rotor snaft 32 on shaft 184 rotating shaft 184 and arm 182 thus opening inlet 168 See Figure 9 permitting fluid in space 102 to drain through outlet 162, through passageway 156 to reservoir 107, causing bull gear 70 to settle on brake pads 92 stopping rotor 32 and bull gear 70. With reference to Figures 9 and 11 to 15 inclusive, fluid fed through passageway 144 from space 02 normally passes through passageway 212 pastPressure Regulating Valve 214, check valve 216 and hydraulic damper 218 in passageway 212. With reference to Figure 11, upper head assembly 46 includes a shaft 220 secured to the top of rotor shaft 32 of lesser diameter than shaft 32 having passageway 222 passing therethrough in communication with passageway 212 and annular dam wall 223 surrounding shaft 220 spaced therefrom. Head 224 seats over shaft 220 and comprises annular wall 226, top 228 and downwardly opening annular endless channel 230 in wall 226 to accommodate dam wall 223. Annular seals 232 are positioned between dam wall 223 and annular channel wall 234 closest shaft 220 to seal a space between head 224 and 220. Hydrodynamic bearings 235 are secured between the inner surface of wall 226 and outer surface of shaft 220 for sealing the space created between the end of shaft 220 and the inner surface of top 228. Four triangular wens 236 extend from head 224 and secure guy wires 38, 40, 42 and 44 thereto. Drain 238 drains fluid from controlled bearing leakage past hydro dynamic bearings 235 from the space between seals 232 and hydrodynamic bearings 235. With reference to Figure 12, upper head assembly 46l comprises housing 300 secured to the top of shaft 32, housing 300 comprising base 301, annular wall 302 upstanding therefrom surrounding wall 303 and passageway 304 connecting passageway 212 and well 303. Mounted and sealed by annular seals 306 within well 303 for vertical displacement relative to housing 303 and seals 306 is shaft 305.Fluid fed through passageways 212 and 304 against the bottom 307 of shaft 305 elevates shaft 305. Holes through top 308 of shaft 305 are used to secure the guy wires 38, 40, t2 and e ydrodynamic bearings are also secured between the shaft 305 and inner wall of the housing 303. Drain 310 drains fluid from controlled bearing leakage past the hydrodynamic bearings from well 303. Fluid pumped up passageway 144 entering passageway 212 and fed to head assembly 46 or 46 elevates head 224 relative to shaft 220 or shaft 305 from housing 300 respectively, thereby tensioning guy wires 38, 40, 42, and 54 To ensure guy tension is maintained relatively constant, direct acting pressure reducing valve 214 See Figure 9 has been inserted into passageway 212 and permits only enough oil to flow therethrough to maintain fluid pressure in the head assembly at the desired pressure. To this end, valve 214 comprises housing 240, spool 242, inlet port 244, outlet port 246, pressure sensing passage 248, compression spring 250, adjustment screw 252 extending through housing 240 and bleed passage 254. Valve 214 is held normally open by the force exerted by spring 250 set by set screw 252 against spool 242. As the pressure in outlet port 246 increases sensed by passage 248 the pressure of the fluid in passage 248 on the face 256 of spool 242 compresses spring 250 when the pressure exceeds the force of the spring, moving spool 242 to close outlet port 244. When valve 214 closes comoletely, a small quantity of fluid drains through passageway 258 to bleed passageway 254 to reservoir 107 not shown preventing reduced pressure from increasing because of valve leakage.Fluid passing valve 214, passes upwardly through one way check valve 216 comprising housing 260 holding ball 262 at the bottom under compression by compression spring 264, under greater pressure than the pressure exerted by compression spring 264 tending to seat ball 262, through passageway 222 to raise head 224 or shaft 305 a predetermined amount as limited by the guys, tensioning the guys and maintaining the tension in the guys. When the fluid is removed from passageway 212 as for example wnen bull cear 70 is brakea , one way check valve 216 precludes fluid from returning past valve 216 by closing under the compression force of spring 264 thereby mainraining the pressure n head assembly 210 and the guy tension in guy wires 38, 40, 42 and a4 Aaoitionally, the floating of head 46 supplies damping to the entire rotor gear box assembly.For regulating this damping as for example wnen fthe guys fluctuate under fluctuating loads hydraulic damper 218 comprising air hydraulic accumulator 270 with hyoraulic restrictor 272 is provided. ,n this case, fluid forced back through passageway 222 in instances of increased pressure through passage 2 enters restrictor 272 See Figure 13 creating heat thereDy acting as a damper and then into the hydraulic accumulator 270,against diaphragm 274 held under the action of compression spring 276 See Figure 12 . If the diaphragm is forced against the spring by the fluid, compressing the spring, the excess fluid is accumulated until the fluid pressure in assembly 46 or 46leases and the diaphragm is restored to its normal position by spring 276 Figure 15 illustrates the tensioning of the guys employing head assembly 46 or 461. As many changes could be made in the embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention, it is intended that all matter contained herein be interpreted as illustrative of the invention, and not in a limiting sense.
