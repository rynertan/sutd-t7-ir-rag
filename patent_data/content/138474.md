A footwear forming machine 101 wherein a shoe or other footwear upper assembly 64 comprising a shoe 70 draped about a last 66 and an inner sole 68 at the bottom of the last, is presented to the machine for applying adhesive and wiping of the lasting margin. The machine includes an inner sole support or footrest 14 to receive the shoe upper assembly 64 means 16, 18, 20, 22, 23 for stretching and forming the upper 70 about the last 66 and means 12 for wiping the upper margin 72 against the inner sole 68 . An adhesive applicator mechanism 30 is provided that includes two extruder sections 31A, 31B operable to apply adhesive to the bottom of the inner sole 68 respectively near each edge of the toe portion of the shoe upper assembly 64 . The two extruder sections 31A, 31B are pivotally adjust able about a pivot point 33 between positions wherein the free ends 31A, 31B thereof are positioned closer to one another to accommodate small shoe sizes and wider apart to accommodate larger shoe sizes to permit application of the adhesive close to the edge of the inner sole 68 , the margin 72 thereafter being wiped against the inner sole 68 .
