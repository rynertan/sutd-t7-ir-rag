# Compositions for controlling alkaline earth metal scales.

## Abstract
The precipitation and deposition of alkaline earth metal scales in an aqueous system is inhibited by comprising adding to the system an anionic polyelectrolyte and an anionic surfactant, the weight ratio of polyelectrolyte to surfactant being in the range from 1000 1 to 1 10. Composi tions containing the electrolyte and surfactant in that ratio are novel.
