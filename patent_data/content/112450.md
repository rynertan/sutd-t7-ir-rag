# System for monitoring and controlling electrophotographic toner operation.

## Abstract
Digital circuitry and microprocessor 50, 52 are used to monitor the quality of toner operations in a copier and take appropriate corrective action based upon the monitor ing results. Patch sensing is used. Reflectivity signals from the patch and from clean photoconductor 20 are analog to digital converted 56 and a plurality of these signals taken over discrete time periods of a sample are stored. The stored signals are averaged for use in determining appro priate toner replenishment responses and or machine fail ure indicators and controls.
