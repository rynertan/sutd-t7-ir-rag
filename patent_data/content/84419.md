## Abstract
This invention relates to improvements in the structural means for connecting a current carrying electrode in a resectoscope to an external electrode lead and more particu larly discloses a resectoscope wherein the electrode can be positively connected via a mouthpiece in which a plug at the tip of the electrode lead is inserted to make a reliable electrical contact. In a resectoscope constructed in accordance with the present invention, a conductive electrode fixing member 22 securing the rear of a current carrying electrode is fitted within a space 20 formed by boring a movable member 11 of insulating material and providing a slit 21 to form a flexible piece 22a , an electrode holding space 28 is formed within this slit 21 , a clamping member 23 is fitted on the side face of the movable member 11 to press on the flexible piece 22a to narrow the width of the electrode holding space 28 and a plug connecting part 24 to which a plug at the tip of an electrode lead is connected is formed on the movable member 11 so that the electrode and the electrode lead are electrically connected tcgether by the electrode fixing member 11 .
