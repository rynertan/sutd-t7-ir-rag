# Apparatus for measuring the electrical conductivity of a subject.

## Abstract
Apparatus for measuring the electrical conductivity of a subject comprises a coil for producing a substantially uni form magnetic field within a predetermind volume and a transpport assembly for causing relative movement be tween the subject and the predetermined volume so as to move at least portions of the subject into and out of the vol ume. A measuring circuit is coupled with the coil for mea suring the electrical conductivity thereacross and a control circuit causes the measuring circuit to measure the electri cal conductivity across the coil a plurality of times during movement of the subject relative to the volume so as to obtain a plurality of measurements of the electrical con ductivity across the coil with different portions of the subject within the volume.
