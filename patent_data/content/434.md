# Connecting block for interconnecting wires and with two matable connector parts and slotted beam contacts.

## Abstract
Connecting block for electrically interconnecting first conductors with associated second conductors, in which a first connector part of insulative material has individual receiving and indexing means for the first conductors and in which a second connector part for mating with the first connector has a body member of insulative material and a plurality of slotted beam contacts. The specification discloses as second connector part a one piece body member 41 and contactholding means 50 . The slotted beam contacts can be assembled easily in cavities 42 in the body member 41 which being in one piece has no join therein to rupture. The holding means 50 has projections 53, 54 which extend through apertures 45 in the wall of the body member 41 to engage in a slot 34 and an aperture 25 in the slotted beam contact, so retaining the contact in the cavity 42 . The connecting block may, for example, be used to provide interconnection fields in telephone systems.
