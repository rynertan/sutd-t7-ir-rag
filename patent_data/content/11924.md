# Polymeric fragrance materials and processes for their manufacture.

## Abstract
The invention provides a sealed product comprising synthetic hydrophilic polymer compositions containing a vol atile active material which is released on exposure to the atmosphere which are wrapped in a transparent film which is impermeable to water vapour. Examples of packaging films which are useful are Barex polythene and barex polypropylene duplex lami nates, PVC PVDC duples laminates PV PVDC polyethylene and PVC PVDC polypropylene triplex laminates and polyes ter PVC polyethylene triplex laminates. These products exhibit a lesser tendency to exude the volatile material even on prolonged storage as compared to previously known products which were wrapped in polyethylene films. In a preferred form these products are produced by preparing a blister pack from any suitable mater ial and using this as a mould into which the monomers are poured and then polymerised. Such products are readily adapted so as to be sold without further packaging or decora tion.

## Description
This invention relates to synthetic hydrophilic polymer compositions which comprise an entrapped volatile active ingredient which is gradually released when the composition is exposed to the atmosphere. The volatile material is mostly commonly a fragrance i.e. a natural essential oil or synthetic perfume or a blend thereof but volatile insecticides bacteriocides pheronomes and fabric softeners may be entrapped to provide products with a consequent variety of applications. All these products are customarily sealed within a package which is substantially impermeable to the volatile material in order to prevent its premature release. A particular problem with systems based upon synthetic hydrophilic polymerised materials is the tendency of the volatile ingredient to exude from the polymer composition upon prolonged storage or exposure to high temperature producing a product which has an unattractive greasy or wet surface. The problem has been especially prevalent in products which were wrapped in a transparent polymeric film in order to maximise their visual appeal to the customer. We have now discovered that this problem of exudation may be alleviated using transparent packaging material which is sufficiently impermeable to water vapour as well as to the volatile substance. Thus the products according to our invention retain their visual appeal and remain functional even on prolonged storage.From one aspect our invention provides a synthetic hydrophilic polymeric composition containing a volatile active ingredient which is capable of controlled release to the atmosphere and a package enclosing said polymeric composition to an extent sufficient substantially to prevent loss of active ingredient said package comprising a transparent film which is substantially impermeable to the active ingredient, and which over at least part of the surface of the package, constitutes the sole barrier between the polymeric composition and the outside atmosphere, said film having a water permeability less than 5 gm m2 per day at 380C and 90,0 RH and sufficiently low substantially to prevent exudation of active ingredient on storage. It will be appreciated that no packaging material suitable for this type of product is totally impermeable to the passage of water vapour. Hitherto transparent packaging films such as PVC film of 200 micron gauge having a permeability of from 5 to 6.0 gm m2 per day au 38 and 90 relative humidity RH has been commonly used and products enclosed in such a film suffer from a tendency to exude the volatile substance. In order to effectively suppress the exudation of a typical product which will be stored for some months prior to sale, we have now discovered that the product should be packaged in a film having a water transmission of less than 5 preferably less than 3 say 2 and most preferably less than 1 expressed in gm m2 per day at 380C and 90 RH. The maximum water permeability which can be tolerated depends on the particular polymer composition and active material.Products having a high tendency to exude require a more water impermeable film in order to prevent high perceptible exudation. h Tj t retrain the properties of being transparent and being impermea le to the volatile substance in order to prevent the escape thereof. ere such a combination of properties is not possessed by a single film a laminate of two or more films may be used. The formulation of such laminates to produce a film having particular properties is a well known technique in the packaging art and certain laminates which are useful according to our invention are commercially available.Examples of packaging films presently available which are useful include Barex polythene and Barex polypropylene duplex laminates Barex is a modified polyacryl onitrile film sold by the Vistron Corporation polyvinylchloride PVC polyvinylidene chloride PVDC duplex laminates PVC PVDC polyethylene and PVC PVDC polypropylene triplex laminates and polyester PVDC PE triplex laminates It will be appreciated that the packaging film selected for a particular product may vary according to the tendency of the volatile material to exude from the particular polymeric material and the conditions to which the package is to be subjected prior to its sale. In particular products which are to be sold in countries where hot dry weather prevails exhibit a greater tendency to exude the volatile material than when they are sold in countries having a temperate climate and thus will normally be packaged in a material having a lower permeability to water vapour. Clearly, whatever the conditions under which the product is to be manufactured stored and sold the packaging film must retain its impermeability to the volatile material. The synthetic polymer compositions to which this invention relates are polymers of alpha beta or beta gamma unsaturated carboxylic esters which possesses hydrophilic functions such as, for example, alkoxy or, preferably, hydroxy groups. Typical monomers are hydroxyethyl acrylate, or preferably hydroxyethyl methacrylate, and the hydroxypropyl, hydroxybutyl and glyceryl esters of acrylic or methacrylic acid. Polyoxyalkylated derivatives of the foregoing monomers may also be used, such as polyoxyethylene acrylate or polyoxypropylene glyceryl monomethacrylate. Usually the number of oxydkylene groups is up to 20 although higher alkoxylates are operative and may be preferred for certain specialised applications. Glycidyl esters of unsaturated fatty acids may also be used as monomers. The monomer mixture preferably contains a minor proportion of one or more bi or poly functional monomers, i.e. monomers having two or more polymerizable unsaturated groups in the molecule. These act as cross linking agents and have the effect of increasing the hardness and rigidity of the polymeric product. Examples are the acrylates and methacrylates of polyhydroxylic compounds such as ethylene glycol propylene glycol, 1 ,3 butylene glycol, 1 ,6 hexane diol, glycerol, pentaerythritol and trimethylolpropane, in each case at least two of the hydroxyl groups being esterified with acrylic or methacrylic acid. A particularly preferred cross linking agent is trimethyl ol propane trimethacryl ate. Al koxyl ated derivatives 5t hydroxy containing polyfunctional monomers, and glycidyl esters are also operative. The prepolymer may optionally contain some non hydrolic monomers such as ethyl methacrylate or isobutyl acrylate. It may also comprise small proportions of other vinylic monomers such vinyl chloride and styrene. If required, a firmer texture may be produced by adjustment of the proportion of cross linking agent in the monomer mixture. Additionally, the hardness and flexibility of the product depend on the amount and nature of the active ingredient and the solubilising tert.end the proportion of cross linking agent may be varied sate or these effect also. No cross linking agent need be added if 2 very soft polymer is required. However, some cross linking agent will usually be included, typically up to 25 e.g. 10 to 20 by weight based on the total weight of monomers. The polymer systems useful in the products of the present invention preferably comprise a solubilising agent as is described in our co pending British Application 4896 77 The solubiliser is an organic compound which has both hydrophilic and lipophilic characteristics. It must be compatible with the polymer, e.g. soluble therein to an extent of at least 5 based on the weight of the polymer and preferably more compatible with the volatile material than is the polymer. Preferably the solubiliser has molecular weight less than 1200 most preferably less than 1000. The solubilising agent may be a surfactant, preferably a nonionic surfactant, such as, for example, a polyalkylene oxide, e.g.polyethylene oxide or polypropylene oxide having from 2 to 25 oxyalkylene units or a polyoxyalkylene condensate with a fatty alcohol or alkyl phenol or with a glycerol or sorbitol ester, or a polyoxyalkylene ester of a fatty acid. Typical examples include polyoxyethylene stearate, polyoxypropylene sorbitan monolaurate, polyoxyethylene glycerol mono oleate and polyoxyethylene nonylphenol.Glyceryl and sorbitan fatty esters themselves are similarly useful as are the other commonly used nonionic surfactants including alkylolamides. It is sometimes convenient to employ lower molecular weight, nonionic hydrotropes such as hydroxyethyl acetate, methyl hydroxyethyl ketone, methyl hydroxyethyl ether or propanediol. Preferably the solubilising agent has at least one hydroxyl group and at least one alkyl group which preferably has from 3 to 18, most preferably 3 to 10 carbon atoms. The solubilising agent may additionally comprise for example, ether, keto, ester, amide, amine,aryl and or cyclo aliphatic groups. We prefer for most purposes that the solubilising agent should be sufficiently involatile not to evaporate to any appreciable extent from the polymer.However, for certain specialised purposes we have discovered that there may be an advantage in using solubilising anents which comprise volatile substances.It is often convenient to use mixtures of solubilising agents, especially mixtures of solubilising agents, having significantly different HLB values Selection of tne optimum solusilising agent depends on the nature of the active ingredient as well as the hydrophilic or other character of the resin For example the solubilising agent may be chosen according to its HLB value so as to be compatible with the volatile materials and with the polymer.Thus for highly lipophilic volatile materials it is desirable to employ the more lipophilic solubilising agents, and preferably to make the polymer more lipophilic in character by lowering the proportion of hydroxyl groups, or to use e mixture o relatively lipophilic and a relatively hydrophilic solubili Although nonionic solubilisers are strongly preferred it is sometimes possible or even advantageous to use cationic surfactants cr hydrotropes as at least part of the solubiliser, such as quaternary ammonium salts orimidazolines The proportion of solubiliser is chosen, preferably with the range 4 to 200 per cent based on the amount of monomer used to prepare the polymer according to the requirements of the system including the relative compatibility of the volatile material and the polymer, the anoint of volatile material to be incorporated and the desired rigidity of the polymer and rate of release of the volatile material. Large amounts of solubiliser tend to soften the polymer, increase the capacity for volatile material and its rate of release and the ease of forming a clear resin. The invention is particularly applicable to volatile materials which are fragrances, including natural essential oils and synthetic perfumes, and blends thereof Typical perfumery materials which may form part of, or possibly the whole of, the active ingredient include natural essential oils such as lemon oil, mandarin oil, clove leaf oil, petitgrain oil, cedar wood oil, patchouli oil, lavandin oil, neroli oil, ylang oil, rose absolute or jasmin absolute, natural resins such as labdanum resin or olibanum resin single perfumery chemicals which may be isolated from natural sources or manufactured synthetically, as for example alcohols such as geraniol, nerol, citronellol, linalol, tetrahydrogeraniol, betaphenylethyl alcohol, methyl phenyl carbinol, dimethyl benzyl carbinol, menthol or cedrol acetates and other esters derived from such alcohols aldehydes such as citral, citronellal, hydroxy citronellal, lauric aldehyde, undecylenic aldehyde, cinnamaldehyde, amyl cinnamic aldehyde, vanillin or heliotropin acetals derived form such aldehydes ketones such as methyl hexyl ketone, the ionones and the methylionones phenolic compounds such as eugenol and isoeugenol synthetic musks such as musk xylene, musk ketone and ethylene brassylate and other materials commonly employed in the art of perfumery. Typically at least five, and usually at least ten, of such materials will be presentas components of the active ingredient. The volatile material is most commonly a fragrance material but volatile insecticides, bacteriocides, pheromones and fabric softeners can also usefully be incorporated. The proportion of volatile material which is incorporated in the polymer may range from the minimum effective concentration, which will depend on the particular volatile material, up to the maximum amount that can be incorporated in the resin, depending on the compatibility of the volatile material with the polymer and the nature and amount of the solubilising agent. It has been found possible, to incorporate up to 200 of some volatile material, based on the weight of the polymer. Other volatile materials may provide useful results in proportions as small as 100 ppm or even less.Typically, however, the proportion of volatile material is between 2.5 and 100 based on the weight of the polymer, e.g. 5 to 50 . The compositions of our invention usually contain water. The presence of some water is generally desirable as a vehicle for the catalyst system used in preparing the polymer. The presence of water also tends to accelerate the volatilisation of the volatile materials and is, therefore, often desirable In amounts up to the maximum capacity of the system, which in practice may be up to 50 by weight of tfle polymer. Typically the amount of water is between 1 and 40 by weight of the polymer. More usually the amount of water is from 2 to 10 by weight of tne polymer. The compositions of our invention may additionally contain relativaly non volatile additives such as colourings. Usually the compositions of our invention contain residues of the polymerisation catalyst or its degradation products. Our novel polymers are conveniently prepared by mixing together the monomers and preferably soluhilising agent and a polymerisation catalyst in the presence of the active ingredients and water. It is ometimes possible to polymerise the mixture without a catalyst, for example by heating or allowing the mixture t stand for a sufficient time, but most practice purposes it is necesary to add a catalyst. In general the polymerisation is initiated by a free radical source, for example, an organic peroxide such as benzoyl peroxide, lauryl, perdicarbonate or isobutyl peroctoate, or an azo compound such as azoisobutyronitrile, which generate free radicals on heating.However, a problem which may arise with such initiators in systems with include volatile ingredients is that tie elevated temperature required to initiate polmer sation in a commercially acceptable time, together with the heat release during the exothermic polymerisation reaction, can result in premature volatilisation of active ingredients or deeradatian of heat sertive materia l 1e have devised catalyst systems whi ch operate at lower temperatures and which, in some preferred cases, work satisfactorily at room temperature or below. These initiator systems belong to the general class of redox catalyst, which are combinations of oxidising and reducing agents. The oxidising agent may be organic, such as one of the organic peroxides already mentioned, or inorganic, such as potassium or ammonium persulphate. A particularly preferred inorganic oxidixing agent is hydrogen peroxide, which has the residue of insoluble inorganic products in the polymer. The oxidising agent may be used in conjunction with an inorganic reducing agent such as sodium thiosulphate or preferably an organic reducing agent such as ascorbic acid or araboascorbic acid erythorbic acid . These last two are especially effective and may be used as polymerisation catalysts in conjunction with an oxidising agent, especially a persulphate. or most preferably, hydrogen peroxide. Mixtures of ascorbic acid and hydrogen peroxide are capable of initiating polymerisation rapidly at room remperature, so avoiding excessive heating of the polymer. Cocatalysts including amines and salts of transition metals such as copper, cobalt, iron, nickel, and manganese are also useful. The proportion of polymerisation catalyst is non critical, although higher proportions will produce shorter average chain lengths.For practical purposes it is not usually convenient to add more than about 5 by weight of catalyst based on the total mixture, preferably 0.1 to 2.5 . Polymerisation is preferably effected under an inert atmosphere of, for example CO2 or nitrogen, or under air tight sealing films to avoid inhibition of polymerisation at surface by oxygen. The polymerising mixture is preferably neutral or slightly acidic to water, and may benefit from the addition of small amounts of strong mineral acid especially when ascorbic acid and hydrogen peroxide is used as the catalyst system. For example, a few drops of any strong mineral acid which does not adversely affect the active ingredient or polymer may be added to the polymerising mixture, usually the most convenient being hydrochloric acid. Polymers of this type may be manufactured in any shape or form by pouring a liquid prepolymer into a suitable mould and subsequently polymerising and or curing the prepolymer to produce a solid product. We have now discovered that a polymerised product containing an entrapped volatile ingredient of the type to which this invention relates can be simultaneously manufactured and packaged for sale by shaping a transparent air impermeable film so as to form the mould.Thus from another aspect our invention provides a process for the manufacture of a solid synthetic hydrophilic polymeric composition containing a volatile active ingredient which process comprises forming a hollow mould from a substantially air impermeable polymeric film having an opening at one end and introducing a liquid mi xture whi ch is capable on polymerisation and or curing of forming a solid polymeric product into the mould and polymerising and or curing said mixture the opening to the mould being sealed before during or after the polymerisation step. Films formed from synthetic polymers such as polyvinyl chloride, polyesters, polyacetals polyvinylidine chloride and polycarbonates are suitable for forming the mould provided a film of suitable gauge e.g.50 to 500 microns more usually 100 to 300 microns is employed. The film used will preferably be substantially impermeable to the passage of water vapour as hereinbefore defined. The mould is preferably formed by shaping two pieces of a suitable film to form opposite halves of the mould. The two halves of the mould may be jointed by any technique which produces a liquid tight joint. Adhesives of various kinds may be employed or heat may be applied so as to bond the surfaces together. The tqo halves of the mould are preferably formed so as to have externally projecting flanges extending along corresponding sections of their perimeters the faces of which come into contact with the two halves of the mould are brought together. Most preferably these flanges extend around the whole of the perimeter of the mould except that portion which defines the opening. The two halves Of the mould are most preferably vacuum formed but other techniques sucr as injection forming may be employed.One or both halves of the mould may be formed so as to impress a decorative design onto their surface which will be impressed onto the surface of the air freshner thereby adding to the appeal of the mra product In e particular . prefered embodiment the flange on the half of the mould extends further from the perimeter than the corresponding flange on the opposite half. When the two halves are brought together this extension forms an overlapping portion which can be used to fix the mould to a jitaLe support.Conveniently this support is a piece of cardborad o, other such packaging material in which a hole or recess is provided for the rigid and at least the overlapping portion of the flange extends over tre edge of the hole or recess. The mould is then mounted on tht support by fixing the flange to the support.In a preferred embodiment the surface of the support which will come into contact with the flange if treated with a suitable lacquer so that when the flanges are joined to one another by heat treatment the mould is also fixed to tha support The support may be cut so that when the mould is placed in position only the overlapping extended portion of the flange comes into contact with the support but preferably it will be cut so that both of the flanges extending from the separate halves of the mould contact the surface of the support. Techniques of this nature are known as blister packaging in the art but as far as the applicants are aware such techniques have previously only been applied to preformed products and blister packages of this type have not previously been employed as moulds for polymerisable materials. The opening to the mould may be closed by sealing the sides of the opening together or by providing a base member which is formed from a material which is impermeable to the fragrance and inert to the polymer. Preferably the mould is formed so as to have a relatively narrow opening so as to minimise the surface of the polymer which is in contact with air during the polymerisation. The opening will be closed shortly after polymerisation is complete so as to minimise the premature loss of the volatile ingredient. The base of the air freshener is of a substantially rigid construction and is shaped so as to fit snugly into the opening in the mould. The loss of fragrance material by virtue of the solid air freshener being in contact with the atmosphere is thereby minimised.The base is impermeable to the fragrance material since if it is not we have found that fragrance will be lost while the freshener is stored. Preferably the base is formed from polyacrylic material. The base may be joined to the air freshener composition by any convenient means e.g. by a suitable adhesive. However, most preferably the base is provided with one or more protruding members on its inner surface and is placed in position in the opening of the mould before the air freshener composition has become completely solid. The protruding members thereby extend into the air freshener composition and as it becomes more solid they are rigidly fixed in position thereby holding the base firmly. These members need not protrude to any great depth in order to fix the base. Preferably they are constructed so that their cross sectional area increases the further they protrude from the base. Most preferably they are of mushroom shaped cross section having a relatively broad cap mounted upon a corresponding narrow stem.Once the air freshener is set solid protruding members of this type can hold the base firmly in position. The face of the base which is opposed to that which is in contact with the polymeric composition will normally be flat so that tne finished product will stand upright on the base member when the latter is placed upon a flat surface. However, the base member may be fitted with a variety of attachment means which will enable the finished product to be mounted in a number of positions. Preferably such attachment means will be formed as an integral part of the structure of the base member so as to simplify the manufacture of the finished article. The aforesaid attachment means may take the form of a hook, a loop afiixed to or a hole bored into the side and perhaps through the base wich canengage a hook or protrusion, suction means e. suction curs or comprise an adhesive layer.Such attachment means may vary in their spatial relationship to the polymerised product so that the latter can be mounted upon a vertical surface as well as on a horizontal surface. Where the base member is not used to close the mould the sealed product will nO T. fflll be sold in conjunction with a suitable supporting member. Such a support will preferably contain a groove or recess into which the pol i LriC products can be inserted and retained although other means of support e.g. chips could be employed. Such supports will also be made from a material which is impermeable to the fragrance such as polyacrylic material. Any polymeric packaging film which is capable of being formed into such a mould or blister pack and which fulfils the requirements described above can be used in this aspect of our invention. For example any of tne specific polymers or laminates described herein are capable of being vacuum formed to provide such moulds or blister packs provided a film of suitable gauge e.g. 50 to 500 microns, more usually 100 to 300 microns is employed. Where poiymer atio is to 2 carried out inside the package the packaging material must be substantially impermeable to oxygen.films employed will have an air permeability of less than 100 preterably less than 10 and most preferably less than 2 cm3 m2 cay bar. The complete package may conveniently be closed by heat sealing . Such techniques require that the inner face of the packaging film be formed from a suitable polymeric material e.g. polyethylene and where a laminate film is employed it is necessary that the inner surface be formed of such a material if the package is to be closed by heat sealing. alternatively,if the inner surface is not heat sealable techniques such as ultrasonics and radio frequency sealing can be used to close the blister pack where the inner face of the packaging film is formed from a material which is susceptible to these methods of closure. A finished product of the aspect of our invention concerned with processes for the manufacture of polymeric fragrance products is shown in the accompanying drawings. Figure 1 which shows the product as a front elevation and Figure 2 showing a side elevation.A hollow mould is formed from two separate halves of transparent 200 micron PVC film. The upper half has a flange 2 which extends onto the surface of a carboard supporting member 3. The lower half of the mould has a smaller flange 4 shown as a dashed line lying wholly underneath the flange 2 but above the supporting member 3. The opening in the mould is closed by a rigid member 5 having two protrusions 6 and 6 which extend into the volume 7 which is occupied by the air freshener.
