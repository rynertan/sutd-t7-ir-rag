# Cooling of a bearing for turbo machinery.

## Abstract
Apparatus is disclosed for cooling pliant film bearings of turbomachinery or the like, and for protecting such bearings against heat transfer from the turbine side of the machinery. The turbomachine incorporates a hollow shaft for better cooling. Embodiments of the invention circulate cooling air through the interior of the hollow shaft and provide various structural configurations thermally to isolate the bearing shaft from the turbine wheel.
