## Description
THE invention relates generally to detecting conditions of rotatable members and has particularly although not exclusive applications to detecting the condition of a vehicle tyre.According to the invention there is provided a device for measuring variable conditions of a rotatable member including mounted on the rotatable member an electrical oscillatory circuit and condition monitoring means arranged to adjust the natural frequency of oscillations of the circuit in response to changes in a condition to be measured, and a frequency detector circuit positioned adjacent the rotatable member to sense the frequency of oscillations of the oscillatory circuit and to provide an output corresponding to the measured condition.The device may be for measuring the condition of a vehicle tyre in which case the oscillatory circuit is mounted to sense the condition of the tyre and the detector circuit is secured to a structural membe r of the vehicle.The condition monitoring means may comprise an air pressure sensing device which is arranged to adjust a capacitive component of the oscillatory circuit.The oscillatory circuit may have separate capacitive devices arranged to be selectively switched into the oscillatory circuit and the pressure sensing device is arranged to control the selective switching.The device may be fitted to measure the condition of two or more tyres of a vehicle and include switching means for selectively providing the outputs of the measured condition at a central console. A single frequency detector circuit may be arranged to be selectively switched to measure the frequency of oscillations of a number of oscillatory circuits, one oscillatory circuit being provided for each tyre.The output signal may be arranged to control automatically the inflation or deflation of the tyre.The output signal may be arranged to produce a warning signal whenever its value differs from a predeterminedValue or range of values. Such a signal may be a visual signal or an audible signal. A tyre pressure measuring device according to the invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a cross section of part of a tyre showing schematically part of the device Figure 2 is a schematic circuit diagram of the device andFigure 3 and 4 are circuit diagrams of parts of the device.Referring to the drawing, in Figure 1 a vehicle tyre 10 is mounted on a rim 12 to which is fitted an air pressure sensing device 14 coupl ed to an electrical oscillatory circuit 16. The circuit 16 includes an inductance coil 18 attached to and around the rim 12. A transmitting inductance coil 20 and receiving inductance coil 22 are attached to a fixed non rotatable structural member not shown of the vehicle.In Figure 2, the oscillatory circuit 16 comprises of the inductance coil 18 which can be connected selectively in series with three capacitors 24. The sensing device 14 is arranged to select which of the capacitors 24 is connected to the coil 18.The inductance coil 20 is driven by a pulse generator 26 via an amplifier 28. The inductance coil 22 is connected to a series circuit comprising an amplifier 30, a divider circuit 32, a frequency to direct current convertor 34 and a comparator indicator circuit 36. In use, whether the vehicle tyre is stationary or rotating, the oscillatory circuit 16 is inductively energised by a field generated by the coil 20. The oscillatory circuit 16 oscillates at its natural frequency, the value of which depends on which of the capacitors 24 is in series with the coil 18. The frequency of oscillation is sensed by inductive coupling with the coil 22 and the frequency of oscillation detected by the circuits 30, 32, 34 and 36 to provide an output corresponding to that frequency.Thus, for example if the tyre pressure falls to an unsatisfactory low level the pressure sensing device 14 causes an appropriate one of the capacitors 24 to be connected in series with the coil 18. The detected frequency that corresponds to a low tyre pressure causes an output signal at the circuit 36 which can be used as a warning to the driver of the vehicle.The circuit details of the pulse generator 26 and the amplifier 28 are shown in Figure 3. The circuit details of the amplifier 30, the divider circuit 32, the frequency to direct current convention 34 and the comparator indicator circuit 36 are shown in Figure 4. An output of the comparator indicator may be provided to produce an audible or visual alarm if the pressure of the tyre reduces to below or exceeds above a predetermined pressure, as desired.Many variations to the device are envisaged. For example, the sensing device 14 may be arranged to adjust a variable capacitor, or select a particular one of separate inductance coils, or vary g variable inductance coil. Further, the sensing device may be ranged to sense another condition such as temperture. Pressure and temperature devices may be provided in combR ion and the frequency oscillations in the coil 18, or other coils may be separately measured to determine either the pressure or erature in turn.
