# CLONING VECTORS IN STREPTOMYCES

## Abstract
The present invention discloses a recombinant DNA cloning vector comprising a a functional origin of replication containing restric tion fragment of plasmid pNM100 and b one or more DNA segments that confer resistance to at least one antibiotic when transformed into a sensitive host cell, said host cell being susceptible to transformation, cell division, and culture.
