# Digital scan converter.

## Abstract
A digital scan converter comprises an A D converter 11 an input buffer 13 a random access memory 15 a write address generator 23 a plurality of read address generator 26, 27, 28 an address switch circuit 24 com posed of a first address switch means for switching the addresses from the write address generator 23 and the read address generators 26, 27, 28 and delivering the addresses via an address signal line to the random access memory 15 , and alternately switching a first address signal line for transmitting the address from the write address generator 23 and a common signal line for commonly transmitting the addresses from the plurality of the read address gener ators 26, 27, 28 for connecting one of said switched lines with the address signal line, and a second switch means for switching in succession the connection between the com mon signal line and a plurality of second signal lines respectively connected with the plurality of the read address generators 26, 27, 28 for transmitting the addresses a plurality of output buffer an output switch circuit 16 having a third switch means cooperating with the second switch means for switching the connection between the first data line for transmitting the digital data from the random access memory 15 and the plurality of the second data lines for transmitting the digital data to the output buffers 17, 18, 19 the output switch circuit 16 being adapted to receive the digital data from the random access memory 15 and switch the connections from the output switch circuit 16 to the plurality of the output buffers 17, 18, 19 and a plurality of D A converters 20, 21, 22 .
