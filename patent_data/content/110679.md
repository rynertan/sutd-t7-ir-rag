# Modular flash system and housing module for use therein.

## Abstract
A modular photographic flash system comprises a plurality of housing modules 21 , some possibly empty and some form ing the housings of flash units 20 , interconnected to form a desired flash unit array 80, 90, 100, 110 . Each housing mo dule comcprises a hollow cylindrical member 21 which is sub stantially square in transverse cross sectional outline and which has dovetail tongues 24 on two of its outside walls 22 and complementary dovetails grooves 25 on the other two outside walls 22 . Adjacent modules are connected by en gagement of a tongue 24 of one module in a groove 25 of the other module, and are locked together by a latch member 35 which is movable into and out of the dovetail groove 25 for engagement in an aperture 26 in the tongue 24 . The latch member 35 is operated by an actuator rod 31 which is carried in a channel 29 in the inner surface of the housing member 21 and which is spring biassed to urge the latch member 35 into its locking position, the rod 31 being moved manually to release the latch member 35 to allow the modules to be connected and disconnected. Each housing module is also provided with means 42, 43 for connecting it to a reflec tor 81, 91, 101, 111 when the module is used as the housing of a flash unit 20 .
