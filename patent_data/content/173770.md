## Description
Title Room thermostat for a gas fired central heating system.The invention relates to a room thermostat for a gas fired central heating system, said thermostat having a temperature sensing element, which in response to the difference between the room temperature and a selected temperature value controls the operation of the burners of the central heating system. Such room thermostats are generally known. They control the room temperature by emitting an electric voltage signal as soon as the temperature decreases below a selected value. This signal opens, after amplification, an electromagnetically actuated gas valve whereby the burners are ignited. If thereafter the temperature rises to the selected value the emited signal falls off and the gas valve closes. This is an on off control. Since the temperature sensing element of the thermostat is usually a bi metal, a certain delay in the operation occurs, i.e. the room temperature decreases to below the set value before the gas valve is reopened. The invention aims at having the central heating system release more heat per unity of time in proportion as the room temperature is lower or differs more from the selected temperature.The heat quantity released is adapted to the need, whereby the burners of the CH system remain burning more continuously and as a result thereof the number of on off switching moments of the burners is strongly decreased, as well as the inoperation losses of the system while the efficiency of the consumption is increased.For it is that as according the temperature approximates the set temperature the burners are going to burn with less intensity, so that the preselected temperature is approached a symptotically. This is achieved according to the invention in that the temperature sensing element comprises a resistor element having a positive temperature coefficient or a semi conductor and thereby influences a partial voltage depending on the value of the room temperature whereby the voltage difference of said voltage and a voltage which depends on the set temperature value is supplied through an amplifier to an electromagnetically actuated gas valve, the opening crosssection of which is dependent on said voltage difference and controls the gas quantity, which is supplied to the burner or burners. The temperature sensing element constituted by a temperature sensitive resistor or a semi conductor emits a voltage which depends on the room temperature, which voltage is compared with a voltage which depends on the temperature which has been adjusted in the thermostat. According as the difference between the room temperature and the adjusted temperature is greater the gas valve is opened wider, so that more heat per unity of time is produced in the central heating system. It will be possible to simultaneously positively control the quantity of air, which is necessary for burning the gas, through the same thermostat if the amplified voltage difference is also supplied to an electromagnetically actuated air slide valve or to an actuating motor for said slide valve or to a ventilator motor, such that the quantity of combustion air which is supplied to the burner s is controlled dependent on the difference between the actual and the requested roomtemperature. The invention will be further explained below with reference to the drawing in which an embodiment, given as an example, of an electronic circuit for the room thermostat according to the invention is shown. A Zenerdiode Z1 is connected between a direct current output of 24 V, obtained from an alternating current mains through a transformer and a rectifier, and ground, in series with resistors R1 1 and R1 2. A semi conductor 2 and in series therewith a resistorR2 and a potentiometer B2 are connected in parallel to the Zenerdiode.The semi conductor 2 is the temperature sensing element or temperature sensor of the thermostat. The resistance of said semi conductor is dependent on the room temperature. The output resistance of the semi conductor is e.g. 2000 Ohm at 250C and the variation in resistance may be e.g. 0.75 of the output resistance per degree C, the resistance increasing if the temperature increases and decreasing when the temperature decreases. A temperature scale not shown is connected with the potentiometer P2 and therewith the desired temperature in the room may be adjusted. If the adjusted temperature is modified, also the voltage issued by the potentiometer changes. In first instance it may be assumed that when the room temperature is equal to the preselected temperature, the voltage loss between points 20 and 21 along the sensor 2 is equal to the loss in voltage between the points 21 and 22 along the selecting or adjusting element. This will be discussed below in more detail. In the point 21 then a voltage difference 0 is present. If now the temperature in the room departs from the adjusted temperature, then in the point 21 a differential voltage is generated, which is connected through a resistor R4 2 to an input 3 of an amplifier 23, which sends an amplified voltage from its output 1 through elements which will be discussed later on to an output Ucv, to which the central heating boiler may be connected. Between the circuit point of 24 V and ground, a potentiometer P1 2 is provided through the intermediary of a resistor R6 1. 0Thereby a temperature difference dT of e.g. 1.5 C may be adjusted such that the burners of the boiler are only ignited if the room 0 temperature has decreased 1.5 below the desired temperature as adjusted on the potentiometer P2. The voltage of the potentiometerP1 2 is connected through the indicated resistors to the input 10 of an amplifier 24, the amplified output voltage of which is sent through the output 8 to a connector terminal U of the ther m mostat. U varies dependent on the voltage difference between the m inputs 2 and 3 of the amplifier 23. The amplifier 23 has been 0 tuned such that it starts having an output at e.g. a A T of 1.5 C. This signal is again amplified in the amplifier 24 such that U is m controlled between 0 and 24 V. U is a function of b T but reversed m e.g. U increases according as AT decreases. Has AT become equal m to 0, then Ucv is made to issue a voltage of 0 V if t T is greater 0 than 0,5 C then Ucv is again made to issue 24 V . Ucv only has a switching function. It can only switch off if the end temperature is reached. In order to prevent swinging, a threshold for the temperature decrease in the room is provided, e.g. of 0.5 AT. The output voltage Um is a function of the temperature difference between the adjusted value and the room temperature.p3 is the adjust resistor in order to permit determining the point when Ucv should be switched from high to low, i.e. in order to determine the switching off point of the room thermostat. As said, by the thermostat according to the invention the heat released by the boiler may be controlled in dependence the value of the temperature difference between the room temperature and the desired or adjusted temperature. Thereby there is not the usual swinging of the boiler operation but the boiler burns in adaptation to the temperature difference for longer periods.Thereby minimal fluelosse5 and a high efficiency of the boiler are obtained.
