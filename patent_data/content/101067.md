# Method of piecing yarns in a spinning machine utilizing an air stream.

## Abstract
Yarns are pieced in a spinning machine utilizing an air stream, such as an open end spinning machine or an air jet spinning machine. For yarn piecing, an end of a yarn unwound from a bobbin is inserted into a twisting mechan ism, and a sliver is newly supplied as a fleece so as to intertwine with the yarn end forming a pieced yarn portion. The thickness of the unwound yarn is detected by a detector and stored in a memory prior to insertion into the twisting mechanism. After the yarn and the sliver have been joined, the thickness of the pieced yarn portion is detected by the detector, and the detected thickness is compared with the stored thickness of the unwound yarn. If the thickness of the pieced yarn portion exceeds an allowable value as a result of such comparison, then the yarn is severed by a cutter, and thereafter a cut end of the yarn is pieced again with the fleece. Preferably, the sliver starts is supplied into the twisting mechanism at a timing advanced or delayed with respect to the previous timing of starting of the supply of the sliver when the yarn is to be pieced again with the sleeve.
