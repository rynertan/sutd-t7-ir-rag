# Lubricant bearing fibers and lubricant compositions therefor.

## Abstract
Fiber lubricant compositions for synthetic fibers having unusual lubricating properties for a spun bonded non woven carpet backing, composed of a mixture of butyl stearate and certain silicone glycol copolymers, as described in US 3 867 188. A needle tufted carpet prepared from a carpet backing bearing a composition as referred to has unexpectedly high strength and unexpectedly low flammability.
