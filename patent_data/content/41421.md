# Dual control steering system.

## Abstract
A dual control system for a vehicle having a first station mounted on a chassis 26 for controlling steering of the vehi cle with a steering wheel 68 , and a second station, mounted on an upperstructure 12 , which is rotatably supported from the chassis 26 , for steering the vehicle with a steering device 42 wherein control inputs for steering the vehicle from the first station and the second station are provided to a common steering gear box 50 , characterized in that it comprises an upperstructure hydraulic reservoir 22 mounted on the upperstructure 12 , an upperstructure power steering pump 20 having an input connected to said upperreservoir 22 and an output for providing pressurized hydraulic fluid, a chassis hydraulic reservoir 72 supported on said chassis 26 , a chassis power steering pump 70 having an input connected to said chassis reservoir 72 and an output for providing pressurized hydraulic fluid to the common steering gear box 50 , a hydraulic connection 74 between said upperstructure reservoir 22 and said chassis reservoir 72 to provide free communication therebetween, a flow divider 24 disposed in the output of said upperstructure power steering pump 20 , having a first output connection 29 for supplying pressurized hydraulic fluid to the common steering gear box 50 and a second pressurized hydraulic fluid output and steering valve means 23 connected to said second output of said flow divider 24 to provide steering control to the common steer ing gear box 50 from the second station.
