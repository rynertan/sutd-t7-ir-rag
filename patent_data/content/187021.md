# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CAPACITIVE KEYBOARD SCANNING

## Abstract
A capacitive keypad 24 is scanned in such a manner that the capacitive value C of an individual key in a given row is multiplied by the sum of the relative capacitance values of all the other keys in the same row by means of an amplifier 32 to generate a combined pulse. The combined pulse is then com pared by a comparator 28 to a threshold voltage Vref 3 to verify whether the individual key in question is in the closed or open position. The verification can be made independently of keypad to keypad variations in the capacitances of the keys, since the combined pulse value does not depend upon the ab solute capacitance value of the keys, but only upon their rela tive values. Also disclosed is a method for scanning to deter mine the presence of multiple key closures. This involves com paring the capacitance of an interrogated key to not only the sum of the other capacitors of its row, but also to the sum of the capacitors of the other rows and columns and a comparison of the resulting value to that generated by previous scans to de tect change.
