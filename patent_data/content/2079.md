# Crystalline silicates and method for preparing same.

## Abstract
A crystalline microporous organosilicate having the composition in terms of moles of oxides of R₂O 0 1.5 M₂O 0.05 Al₂O₃ 40 70 SiO₂ x H₂O wherein R is represents a tetraethylammonium cation, M is an alkali metal cation and x has a value of 0 to 15 depending upon the degree of hydration of the composition. The organosilicate is prepared hydrothermally using a reaction mixture comprising tetraethylammonium cations, alkali metal cations, water and a reactive source of silica. The crystalline organosilicates are useful as adsorbents and, in their catalytically active form, as catalysts for organic compound formation.
