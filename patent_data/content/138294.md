# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PRODUCING BLENDS OF RESINUOUS THERMOPLASTIC FIBER AND LAMINATED STRUCTURES PRODUCED THEREFROM

## Abstract
Reinforced structures of graphite, fiberglass, and the like, together with thermoplastic resinous fibers such as in ribbon, filament and monofilament form are produced. The graphite fiber is combined or blended with a resinous fiber to form a single yarn. The blended yarn is then woven into a soft, supple and flexible fabric having the appropriate concentration of graphite and resin, and with good uniform characteristics. Hy brid fabrics produced by interweaving graphite and the poly meric fibers, ribbon, etc., may be utilized instead of the blended yarn. The fabric is finally shaped to conform with a mold or sub strate and heated to melt the resin and produce the resin gra phite laminate.
