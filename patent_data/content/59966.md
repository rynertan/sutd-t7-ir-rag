## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTIONSUBSTITUTED THIAZOLIDINE CARBOXYLIC ACID ANALOGS ANDDERIVATIVES AS ANTIHYPERTENSIVESBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention, in its broad aspects, relates to substituted arylthiazolidine carboxylic acid analogs and derivatives which are potent angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors useful in the treatment of hypertension.DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The substituted arylthiazolidine carboxylic acid analogs and derivative compounds of this invention are represented by the following formula EMI1.1 wherein R and R3 are the same or different and are hydrogen, loweralkyl, aralkyl R1 is alkyl of from one to ten carbon atoms which include, branched, cyclic and unsaturated alkyl groups substituted alkyl of from one to six carbon atoms wherein the substituent is amino, arylthio, aryloxy, hydroxy, arylamino, and acylamino aralkyl and heteroaralkyl optionally substituted by halo, loweralkyl, hydroxy, aminoloweralkyl, alkoxy and amino groups and wherein the alkyl group contains from one to six carbon atoms R2 is an aryl, substituted aryl, heteroaryl or substituted heteroaryl group selected from the group consisting of phenyl, naphthyl, or biphenyl wherein the substituent is hydroxyl or lower alkyloxy X is CH2 or S and, the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Preferred are those compounds of Formula I wherein R and R3 are the same or different and are hydrogen, loweralkyl, aralkyl R1 is alkyl of one to six carbon atoms optionally substituted by amino, hydroxyl, acylamino, aryloxy aralkyl, and heteroaralkyl optionally substituted by halo, aminoloweralkyl, hydroxy, alkoxy, and amino groups wherein the alkyl groups contain from one to six carbon atoms R2 is phenyl, napthyl, biphenyl, or 2 hydroxy phenyl and, X is CH2 or S. More preferred are compounds of Formula I wherein R and R3 are the same or different and are hydrogen or loweralkyl R1 is aralkyl and heteroaralkyl both optionally substituted by halo, hydroxy, and amino groups wherein the alkyl groups contain from one to four carbon atoms R2 is 2 hydroxyphenyl or phenyl and, X is S. The preferred and more preferred compounds of Formula I also include the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. The lower alkyl groups, except where noted otherwise, are straight or branched chain hydrocarbon radicals containing from one to six carbon atoms such as, for example, methyl, ethyl, isopentyl, and the like. Halo means fluoro, bromo, cbloro, or iodo. In R1, the aryl groups refer to phenyl, biphenyl, or naphthyl and the heteroaryl groups include, for example, pyridyl, thienyl, furyl, imidazolyl, quinolinyl, isoquinolinyl, indolyl, benzthienyl, thiazolyl, and the like. Aralkyl groups refers to loweralkyl groups substituted by phenyl, biphenyl, or naphthyl. Acyl refers to lower alkanoyl or aroyl. The compounds of this invention are synthesized by the methods described below, whereinR, R1, R2 , R3 and X are as defined above, employing starting materials which are known to those skilled in the art and which are described in the literature. Reactive, interfering functionality in these starting materials such as, for example, hydroxy, phenolic, carboxylic acid, or amino groups, can be masked by protecting groups which can be subsequently removed to afford desired end products.Appropriate protecting groups are also known to those skilled in the art and described in the literature.REACTION SCHEMEEMI4.1 Dipeptide III is prepared by coupling known, substituted imino carboxylic acids having the formula EMI5.1 with N carbobenzyloxyglycine, N t butoxycarbonylglycine, N phthaloylglycine, or similar N protected glycine derivatives by activating the carboxyl group of these glycine derivatives as their acid chlorides and performing the coupling under basic, aqueous conditions or by using condensing agents such as, for example, carbodiimide or diphenyl phosphorylazide, followed by removal of the protecting groups by established methods known to those skilled in the art of peptide chemistry. The condensation of compound III with compound II is conducted in an aqueous solution, optimally near neutrality, or in a suitable organic solvent e.g., CH3CN, in the presence of sodium cyanoborohydride to give compound I after removing the protecting groups, if any, by standard methods. In products of Formula I, the carbon atoms to which R1, R2 and CO2R are attached are asymmetric so that diastereomers of Formula I are possible. Starting material IV can be used as a mixture of diastereomers or as a pure diastereomer.When mixtures of diastereomers are formed in the synthesis of compounds of Formula I, they may be separated, if desired, to afford the preferred diastereomer by chromatographic or fractional crystallization methods. In general, the absolute configuration preferred at the carbons to which R1 and the CO2R3 groups are attached are those of an L aminoacid configuration. Furthermore, R2 is preferred in a cis orientation relative to theCO2R3 group. The compounds of this invention form salts with various inorganic and organic acids and bases which are also within the scope of the invention.Such salts include ammonium salts, alkali metal salts like sodium and potassium salts which are preferred , alkaline earth metal salts like the calcium and magnesium salts, salts with organic bases e.g., dicyclohexylamine salts, N methyl D glucamine, salts with amino acids like arginine, lysine and the like. Also salts with organic and inorganic acids may be prepared, e.g., HC1, HBr, H2SO4,H3PO4, methanesulfonic, toluensulfonic, maleic, fumaric, camphorsulfonic. The non toxic physiologically acceptable salts are preferred, although other salts are also useful, e.g., in isolating or purifying the product. The salts may be formed by conventional means as by reacting the free acid or free base forms of the product with one or more equivalents of the appropriate base or acid in a solvent or medium in which the salt is insoluble, or in a solvent such as water which is then removed in vacuo or by freeze drying or by exchanging the cations of an existing salt for another cation on a suitable ion exchange resin. The compounds of this invention inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme and thus block conversion of the decapeptide angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II is a potent pressor substance. Thus, blood pressure lowering can result from inhibition of its biosynthesis especially in animals and humans whose hypertension is angiotensinII related. Furthermore, converting enzyme degrades the vasodepressor substance, bradykinin. Therefore, inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme may lower blood pressure also by potentiation of bradykinin. Although the relative importance of these and other possible mechanisms remains to be established, inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme are effective antihypertensive agents in a variety of animal models and are useful clinically, for example, in many human patients with renovascular, malignant and essential hypertension. See, for example,D.W. Cushman et al., Biochemistry 16, 5484 1977 . The evaluation of converting enzyme inhibitors is guided by in vitro enzyme inhibition assays. For example, a useful method is that ofY. Piquilloud, A. Reinharz and M. Roth, Biochem.Biophys. Acta, 206, 136 1970 in which the hydrolysis of carbobenzyloxyphenylalanylhistidinylleucine is measured. In vivo evaluations may be made, for example, in normotensive rats challenged with angiotensin I by the technique of J.R. Weeks and J.A. Jones, Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med., 104, 646 1960 or in a high renin rat model such as that ofS. Koletsky et al., Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 125, 96 1967 . Thus, the compounds of this invention are useful as antihypertensives in treating hypertensive mammals, including humans, and they can be utilized to achieve the reduction of blood pressure by formulating in compositions such as tablets, capsules or elixirs for oral administration or in sterile solutions or suspensions for parenteral administration. The compounds of this invention can be administered to patients in need of such treatment in a dosage range of 1 to 200 mg per patient generally given several times, thus giving a total daily dose of from 1 to 800 mg per day. The dose will vary depending on severity of disease, weight of patient and other factors which a person skilled in the art will recognize. Also the compounds of this invention may be given in combination with other diuretics or antihypertensives. Typically, these are combinations whose individual per day dosages range from one fifth of the minimally recommended clinical dosages to the maximum recommended levels for the entities when they are given singly.To illustrate these combinations, one of the antihypertensives of this invention, effective clinically in the range 5 200 milligrams per day, can be effectively combined at levels ranging from 1 200 milligrams per day with the following antihypertensives and diuretics in dose ranges per day as indicated hydrochlorothiazide 10 100 mg , timolol 5 60 mg , methyldopa 65 2000 mg , the pivaloyloxyethyl ester of methyldopa 30 1000 mg , indacrinone 25 150 mg , and 4 13 2 l hydroxycyclohexyl ethyl 4 oxo 2 thiazolidinyljpropylg benzoic acid 10 100 mg . In addition, the triple drug combinations of hydrochlorothiazide 10 100 mg plus amiloride 5 20 mg plus converting enzyme inhibitor of this invention 1 200 mg or hydrochlorothiazide 10 100 mg plus timolol 5 60 mg plus the converting enzyme inhibitor of this invention 1 200 mg are effective combinations to control blood pressure in hypertensive patients. The above dose ranges will be adjusted on a unit basis as necessary to permit divided daily dosage. Also, the dose will vary depending on the severity of the disease, weight of patient and other factors which a person skilled in the art will recognize. Typically the combinations shown above are formulated into pharmaceutical compositions as discussed below. About 1 to 100 mg of a compound or mixture of compounds of Formula I or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof is compounded with a physiologically acceptable vehicle, carrier, excipient, binder, preservative, stabilizer, flavor, etc., in a unit dosage form as called for by accepted pharmaceutical practice. The amount of active substance in these compositions or preparations is such that a suitable dosage in the range indicated is obtained. Illustrative of the adjuvants which may be incorporated in tablets, capsules and the like are the following a binder such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin an excipient such as microcrystalline cellulose a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, pregelatinized starch, alginic acid and the like a lubricant such as magnesium stearate a sweetening agent such as sucrose, lactose or saccharine a flavoring agent such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen or cherry. When the dosage unit form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier such as fatty oil. Various other materials may be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical form of the dosage unit. For instance, tablets may be coated with shellac, sugar or both.A syrup or elixir may contain the active compound, sucrose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propyl parabens as preservatives, a dye and a flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor. Sterile compositions for injection can be formulated according to conventional pharmaceutical practice by dissolving or suspending the active substance in a vehicle such as water for injection, a naturally occurring vegetable oil like sesame oil, coconut oil, peanut oil, cottonseed oil, etc. or a synthetic fatty vehicle like ethyl oleate or the like. Buffers, preservatives, antioxidants and the like can be incorporated as required. The following examples are illustrative of the invention and constitute especially preferred embodiments. The preferred diastereomers of these examples are isolated by conventional column chromatography or fractional crystallization. Unless otherwise indicated, all temperatures are in degreesCelsius. EXAMPLE 1 3 N Phthaloylglycyl 2 2 Hydroxyphenyl 4 R Thiazolidinecarboxylic Acid A 4.5 g 0.02 mole quantity of 2 2 hydroxyphenyl 4 R thiazolidinecarboxylic acid prepared according to H. Soloway et al., JACS 70 1667 1948 is suspended in 65 ml of methylene chloride in a 250 ml flask equipped with a stirring bar and calcium chloride drying tube, and treated with 4.55 g 0.045 mole of triethyl amine. The reaction mixture, now a light yellow solution, is chilled in an ice bath 00 for 15 minutes, then treated with 4.47 g 0.02 mole of phthaloylglycyl chloride. After 2 minutes of stirring at 0 C, the ice bath is removed and stirring continued at room temperature for 3 hours.The clear yellow solution is then made weakly acidic by careful addition of 2.5N HC1. The organic layer is washed twice with water, once with saturated salt solution, dried over magnesium sulfate and concentrated in vacuo to a yellow foam. Trituration of this foam with ether provides 4.15 g of a light yellow solid. Chromatography over silica gel chloroform methanol 15 1 provides material with a good nmr spectrum in deuteromethanol phthalamido aromatic doublet at 7.75 ppm phenolic aromatic multiplet at 6.98 ppm singlets at 6.52 and 3.4 ppm and multiplets at 5.0 and 4.2 ppm.

A 500 mg 1.21 millimole quantity of 3 N phthaloylglycyl 2 2 hydroxyphenyl 4 R thiazolidinecarboxylic acid can be suspended in 5 ml of anhydrous ethyl alcohol in a 25 ml flask equipped with a stirring bar and reflux condenser with a calcium chloride drying tube. 1.21 ml of a 1M solution of hydrazine hydrate in absolute ethyl alcohol can be added, and the resulting mixture stirred and refluxed for 1 hour. During this time, all solid should go into solution, followed by the formation of a white precipitate. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture can be evaporated in vacuo, and the residual solid stirred with 4 ml of 2N HC1 at 500C for 10 minutes, then allowed to slowly cool to room temperature over a 30 minute period. The mixture can then be filtered to remove the phthalylhydrazide and the filtrate concentrated in vacuo to a yellow foam which can be dissolved in 20 ml of water and placed on a column ofDowex 50W X2 H . Following a water wash, the column can be eluted with a total of 100 ml of water containing 2 pyridine.

After 1 hour, 10 ml more water can be added and the solution acidified to pH 2 with conc. HC1. The mixture can then be chilled, and the precipitated solid can be collected by filtration. The crude t butyloxycarbonyl derivative which can then be obtained can then, after drying, be stirred in 25 30 ml of a 4N HCl ethyl acetate solution at OOC for 1 hour.Evaporation of the solvent and excess HC1 can provide crude 3 glycyl 2 2 hydroxyphenyl 4 R thiazolidine carboxylic acid as the hydrochloride salt. This material can then be purified and converted to the free base by eluting it from a column of Dowex SOW H with water containing 2 pyridine.

The resulting mixture can then be stirred at room temperature for 45 minutes. The stopper can then be replaced by aY tube fitted with a septum and calcium chloride drying tube, and a solution of 1.57 g 0.025 mole of sodium cyanoborohydride in 30 ml of ethyl alcohol can b2 slowly added to the well stirred mixture over a period of 4 5 hours via the septum and a syringe on a syringe pump.The reaction mixture can then be stirred for an additional 10 15 hours, following which it can be treated with acetic acid until just weakly acidic.
