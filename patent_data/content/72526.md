# AC to AC power converter with a controllable power factor.

## Abstract
The input power factor of an AC to AC static power converter is continuously adjustable between a maximum leading or lagging phase angle, determined by the load power factor, through rapidly transferring between conven tional and complementary unrestricted frequency changer operation with the proportion of each sub generator cycle interval dedicated to each mode of operation being selected to produce the desired input power factor. Since the input power factor affects generator excitation, the input power factor control can be used in a closed loop feedback control system to regulate generator voltage.
