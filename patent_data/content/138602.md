# Method of fabricating a photomask pattern.

## Abstract
A method of fabricating a photomask pattern 210 , hav ing a matrix array of unit patterns 201 on a photomask 200 , involves two exposure modes. In a first exposure mode select ed matrix locations 211 to 214 are exposed to an optical image for forming a unit pattern. In a second exposure mode the other matrix locations are exposed to the optical image in a regular ordered sequence by step and repeat printing D, E, F, G, H . Each unit pattern has a vernier pattern. Vernier pat terns of adjacent unit patterns overlap 230 to provide for measurement of shear. The employment of the two exposure modes allows accumulated printing shear to be measured from overlapping verniers patterns provided at locations e, f, g, h where unit patterns formed in the first and second modes re spectively are adjacent.
