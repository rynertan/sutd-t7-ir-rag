The method of treating burns comprises the parenteral, oral or local administration of an amount of the active compound, that is effective to alleviate the symptoms of a burn. Generally, the parenteral dosage will vary depending on the host. The particular compound trifluoperazine has been utilized successfully in rats at levels of 80 mg kg body weight administered as a single dose. Other dosage regimens may be used which comprise administering the compound in divided doses over a period of days depending on the severity of the burn, the size of the involved area and the host.Generally, for humans the parenteral dose may range from 1 25 mg or more given as a single dose or larger amounts may be given in divided doses. The mode of injection may be intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular or otherwise. The dose will depend on the particular compound chosen and may be adjusted to give the optimum response in a given subject. Administration may also be by means of slow intravenous drip with or without the adminstration of anti infective agents or electrolytes usually given to severely burned patients. The compounds may also be administered orally using tablets, capsules, suspensions or aqueous solutions. The compositions may be prepared using conventional techniques. The particular compounds that may be used are selected using the procedure set forth by Levin et al. Mol. Pharmacol 12, 581 589 1976 which is incorporated by.reference. While Levin et al use the term activator , it is now recognized that this material is the protein known as calmodulin. See Kakiuchi et al, supra pp l 3. The criteria for the inclusion of a particular compound as one having the ability to interfere with the action of calcium calmodulin complex is that the compound prevent or alleviate a trauma to mammalian skin and that it have an I50 activated value of less than 320 uM in the Levin, et al., supra phosphodiesterase inhibition test. Especially preferred are those compounds with an 150 activated value of less than 100 uM. Many phenothiazines, thioxanthenes, butyrophenones, diphenylbutylamines, benzodiazepines, dibenzodiazepines, dibenzazepines and naphthalenesulfonamides that interfere with the action of calcium calmodulin complex are commercially available. A number of these compounds are described in Drills Pharmacology In Medicine, DiPalma, 4th Edition, pp 466 501 which is incorporated by reference and naphthelenesulfonamides are described inHidaka, B, and Tanaka, T., Calmodulin and IntracellularCa receptors, S. Rakuchi, et al, editors PlenumPress, NY 1982 pp. 19 23, which is incorporated by reference. The presently preferred compound is trifluoperazine. The applicant does not wish to be bound by any theory by which the invention operates but it is believed that the therapeutic action is based on the fact that in skin burns and other skin injuries, there is a rapid release of bradykinin and serotonin. Both of these hormones tend to increase the intracellular concentration of calcium ions which bind the protein calmodulin to form a calcium calmodulin complex. This complex activates phospholipase A2. The activated fuzz AX acts 6n the cell membrane phospholipids causing the destruction of the cell mebrane. This causes the loss of proteins, enzymes and other cell components, and the loss of the integrity of the integumentary system as a barrier to invasion by pathogenic organisms.The calcium calmodulin complex also activates glucose 1,6 bisphosphatase which is the enzyme that degrades glucose 1, 6 bisphosphate which is involved with carbohydrate metabolism. The decrease in the concentration of glucose l, 6 bisphosphate causes a decrease in glycolysis with the resulting decrease in adenosine tri phosphate ATP concentration. The decrease in ATP concentration also contributes to the destruction of the cell membrane and the discharge of the cell contents as noted above. The calmodulin binding agents are believed to bind to the calciumcalmodulin complex and render it substantially biologically inert with regard to the activation of phospholipase A2 and glucose l, 6 bisphosphatase. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The following studies are, illustrative of the invention and are not to be construed as a limitation on the scope of the invention. The preferred compound, trifluoperazine, was utilized to heal burns, sunburns and frostbites. Burns were induced by pouring water at 1000C on the skin of rats. The compound has a clearly visible effect on the skin in that it markedly reduced the redness of the skin after burning. Its effect was further investigated by measuring several biochemical parameters which characterize burns, sunburns and frostbites. The following parameters were measured . a Hemoglobin In the inflammatory response to thermal injury, increased capaillary,perm eability is an early and important vascular event. Thermal injury . causes the extravascular accumulation of erythrocytes Green, K.L., Br. J. Exp. Pathol. 59 38 47 1978 and hemoglobin is released from the heat altered red cells Leading Articles , Lancet 1 153 155 1960 . b ATP A characteristic change of an injured tissue is a decrease in the concentration of ATP, namely, the cell energy. c Enzyme s activities In an injured tissue, due to the pathological changes in cell membrane, there is a loss from the cell of several enzymes. The activities of soluble 6 phosphogluconate dehydrogenase and particulate and soluble hexokinase were found to be markedly reduced in the burned skin. d Protein The concentration of protein in the burned skin is significantly decreased. These experiments and their results will now be described in detail METHODSPreparation and treatment of rat skins Charles River.albino rats, aged 8 10 days 15 22 g b.wt fed ad libitum were used. Skin burns were induced in the rats under anesthesia.by pouring water at 100 CC on the abdomen and chest area.Trifluoperazine was administered either prior to or after the induction of burns. Identical rats with and without burns served as controls. The skin from the abdomen and chest was removed and rapidly frozen between a pair of aluminium tongs precooled in liquid N. The subcutaneous fat was scraped off and discarded, and the frozen skins were stored in liquid N2 until used 24 h. . The frozen skins were powdered in a mortar cooled liquid N2 and the powder was used for extraction of ATP, hemoglobin, protein and enzymes. Injection a Injection prior to inducing burns The animals were injected intraperitoneally with trifluoperazine dihydrochloride 80 mg kg body wt. in 0.1 ml saline. One hundred minutes later skin burns were induced at 1000C .After an additional 20 min., the skin was removed and the biochemical parameters were assayed. b Injection after burning The animals were injected immediately after burning with the same solution as in a and the effects were studied 1 hour later.Cream 400 mg of trifluoperazine dihydrochloride was mixed with 5 g of Oil of Olay Beauty Fluid OlayCompany Inc. and applied topically.Extraction and determination of ATP The frozen skin powder 70 9Omg was placed on top of 1 ml frozen 5 perchloric acid containing 1 mMEDTA, and extracted at 100C. After centrifugation, the extract was neutralized with SOB. The precipitated potassium perchlorate was removed by centrifugation and the clear supernatant was used for determination of ATP. ATP was measured as described by Lowry et al. Lowry, O.R.,Passonneau, J.v., Basselberger, F.X and Schulz, D.W., J. Biol. Chem. 239 18 30 1964 . Preparation and assay for hemoglobin and enzymes The mitochondrial and soluble fractions were separated and hexokinase and 6 phosphogluconate dehydrogenase activities were assayed, as described by Beitner et al. Beitner, R., Lilling, G., Frucht, H., Ben Porat, H., and Sofer, Y., Biochem. Med. 30 369 380 1983 . 100 ul of the soluble fraction was added to 1 ml of 0.25 M sucrose and hemoglobin was estimated specrophotometrically at 420 mu.Protein determination Protein was measured by the method of Lowry et al. Lowry, O.H., Rosenbrough, N.J., Farr, A.L. andRandall, R.J., J. Biol. Chem. 193 265 275 1951 with crystalline bovine serum albumin as a standard.

RESULTS a Effects or trifluoperazine administered as an injectible solution When trifluoperazine was injected 100 min prior to inducing burns, it completely prevented the increase in hemoglobin content, and its concentration was simil ar to that of normal control skins. Similar results were obtained when trifluoperazine was injected immediately after burning and its effect was studied 1 hr later. Treatment with trifluoperazine completely reversed the effect of burning on hemoglobin content. The experiments demonstrated in Table 1 show the effect of trifluoperazine on ATP concentration in skin. It can be seen that burning induced a marked decrease in the levels of ATP in skin, whereas injection of trifluoperazine 100 min prior to inducing burns A almost completely prevented the decrease in the concentration of ATP. Similar results were obtained when trifluoperazine was injected after burning and itseffects studies 1 hour later B . As shown in Table 2, under identical conditions, trifluoperazine also antagonizedthe effect of burns.on the activity of soluble 6 phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. The activity of this enzyme, which is markedly reduced by burns, was almost completely restored by injection of trifluoperazine either prior to inducing burns A or after burning B . Similar results were obtained for hexokinase Table 3 . Burns induced a marked decrease in the activity of this enzyme from both the mitochondrial and soluble fractions and trifluoperazine antagonized this effect when injected either prior to inducing burns A or after burning B . The results presented in Table 4 show the effect of trifluoperazine on protein concentration in the soluble fraction from rat skin. It can be seen that burning induced a significant decrease in protein concentration, whereas injection of trifluoperazine prior to inducing burns A , or after burning B , reversed this effect. b Effects of trifluoperazine administered topically in the form of a cream The results presented in Tables 5 9 show the effects of trifluoperazine administered topically to the bruned skin in the form of a cream. It can be seen that the effects of trifluoperazine applied in the form of a cream for 2 hours from onset of burns were similar to those obtained by the injectale solution. Namely, the cream reversed the changes in hemoglobin, ATP and protein concentration induced by burns Tables 5, 6 and 9 respectively . It is also reversed the reduction in enzymes activities in the burned skin Tables 7 and 8 . These results show that trifluoperazine is very effective in the treatment and prevention of burns.It prevented and abolished the marked changes in the skin content of hemoglobin, ATP, protein and enzymes activities induced by burns. It also has a clearly visible effect on the skin. Similar results are obtained in the treatment of sunburn and frostbite. Since the compound acts both by treating and preventing burns, sunburns and frostbite, it may be used both in first aid and burn treatment and also to protect persons exposed to fire or the sun in the course of their daily work e.g. soldiers, firemen, outdoor workers, etc. and as protective measure in those plants and factories where employees work with fire. It has been found that trifluoperazine is.effective in the treatment of frostbite injuries.Frostbite was induced in rats under anesthesia by applying dry ice to the skin in the abdomen area.Trifluoperazine was administered topically to the frost injured skin in the form of 20 by weight dispersion in Oil of Olay Beauty Fluid Olay CompanyInc . The results as reported in Tables 10 13 show the effects on hemoglobin, ATP, and enzymes activities in the frost injured skin. It can be seen that the changes in these biochemical parameters induced by frostbite are similar to those induced by burns, namely, and increase in hemoglobin concentration and a decrease in ATP, and enzymes activities. These experiments reveal that trifluoperazine reverses the changes in all these biochemical parameters to normal control levels.

Trifluoperazine was also found to be effective in the prevention and treatment of sunburn. Sunburn was induced in rats under anesthesia by exposing their skin in the abdomen area to a UV lamp Osram SonnenstrahlerUltra Vitalux R , which closely resembles natural sunlight. The distance between lamp and the animal was 17.5 cm and the time of exposure was 1 2 minutes.Trifluoperazine was administered either as an injectable solution 2 mg per rat or topically in the form of a cream 88 of trifluoperazine in Oil of Olay. Tables 14 21 show the effects of trifluoperazine on hemoglobin, ATP, and enzymes activity in the sunburned skin. It can be seen that trifluoperazine administered either as an injectable solution or topically in the form of a cream, reversed the changes in these biochemical parameters. These results show that trifluoperazine has utility in the treatment of sunburn.

In the experiments demonstrated in Tables 32 43 the compound thioridazine was used to determine its effectiveness in treating experimentally induced burns, sunburns and frostbite. As shown in Tables 32 35 thioridazine reversed the marked changes in the skin content of hemoglobin, ATP and enzymes activities induced by burns 1000C water . It also reversed the changes in these biochemical parameters induced by sunburns, when administered topically to the sunburned skin in the form of a cream Tables 36 39 . As shown inTables 40 43, thioridazine was also very effective in the treatment of frostbite. It also has a clearly visible effect on the skin.
