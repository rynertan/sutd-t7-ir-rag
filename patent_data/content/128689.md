# Iron chloride waste treatment in molten salt.

## Abstract
A process for treating iron chloride wastes such as those obtained when chlorinating titanium ore is disclosed. The pro cess involves reacting the iron chlorides with limestone in mol ten CaCl₂ xH₂O, where x equals 3 6 and separating the result ing iron oxide from the molten CaCl₂ xH₂O.
