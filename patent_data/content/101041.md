# Zerovalent nickel phosphite complexes.

## Abstract
Organic zerovalent nickel complexes wherein the orga nic portion is derived from an ester of pentaerythritol phosphite. The complexes are believed to have a tetrahedral structure one nickel atom is complexed with four molecules of the pentaerythritol phosphite ester. The nickel complexes are useful as polymer additives, being effective to impart improved resistance to deterioration of olefin polymers upon exposure to ultraviolet light
