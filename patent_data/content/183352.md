Figure 2 shows the inhibition of cytopathic effect exerted by HTLV IIIB bearing H9 cells against a normal helper inducer T cell clone YTA1 by Suramin and is more fully described in Example 2.The Invention This invention is specially in the use of the drug Suramin to treat 1 patients with diseases related to and believed to be caused by the human T cell leukemia family of viruses, including but not limited to AIDS, pre AIDS lymphadenopathy syndromej, Kaposi s sarcoma, and human T cell leukemia lymphoma 23 persons who are or have been infected with one or more of these viruses including seropositive persons with the aim of preventing the development of disease and 3j persons who have been exposed to one of these viruses with the aim of preventing HTLV related diseases. It is believed and is shown that Suramin can inhibit the replication of HTLV III in a T cell line and interferes with the reverse transcriptase of HTLV III.This drug has been used previously for the treatment of onchoceriasis and certain forms of Trypanosomiasis. The use disclosed here, however, is unrelated to its use for the treatment of those parasitic diseases and it is specially a function of this invention to develop a minimal effective range which has been found to be 50 pg ml or greater.Precis of Protocol Suramin discussed above is a drug which has been used in human beings for many decades. It has been used primarily to treat African sleeping sickness trypanosomiasis and onchocerciasis. Its mechanism of action against these very different organisms is still obscure. It has recently been discovered that this drug is an inhibitor of reverse transcriptase, an enzyme necessary for the replication oi retroviruses. In May 1984, Dr. Robert Gallo and his colleagues discovered thatAcquired Immunodeficiency Disease Syndrome AIDS was caused by a retrovirus denoted by the initials HTLV III cf. Science, 224 497 and 506 of 4 May 1984 and 807 of 11May 1984 . It is believed that AIDS is caused and perpetuated by the replication of HTLV III once a susceptible patient becomes infected with this virus.It has recently been discovered that the in vitro replication of HTLV III can be inhibited by concentrations of Suramin that can be achieved In human beings. This invention therefore notes that an established intravenous regimen of Suramin can inhibit in vivo replication of HTLV III in a patient with AIDS provided that the concentration of Suramin is monitored to 50 vg ml or greater and that the drug can be safely administered to patients with AIDS.The Treating AgentEMI3.1 Suramin is a pinkish white flocculant powder, with high solubility in water more than 10 w v its solutions are stable to boiling. Suramin is hygroscopic and absorbs moisture from the atmosphere unless kept in a desiccator the presence of this unsuspected water may cause error in quantitative experiments. It should be stored in the dark and under dry conditions.In Merck Index Tenth Edition Suramin is described as 8,8 car bonylbis imino3,1 phenylenecarbonylimino 4 methyl 3,1 phenylene carbonyl imino bls l,3,5 naphthalene trisul fonic acid hexasodium salt hexasodium sym bis m amino benzoyl m amino p methylbenozyl l naphthylamino 4,6,8 tri sulfonate carbamide Bayer 205 309F, Antrypol Germanin Moranyl 1 Naganol Nagamin Naphuride Sodium.

Background of AIDS and the Therapeutic Use of Suramin in Connection with the Illness Of the HTLV I, II, or III related diseases,AIDS is most prominantly related to this invent ion. In 1980 81 the apparently new and unexplained disorder called AIDS was recognized. The disorder is a pandemic imnunosuppressive disease that predisposes to life threatening infections with opportunistic organisms and certain neoplasms especially Kaposi s sarcoma and occasionally lymphoma , which is believed to be indicia of the underlying imnune impairment. Characteristically,AIDS is associated with a progressive depletion of T cells, especially the helper inducer subset bearing theOKT4 surface marker. Most cases of AIDS have occurred in patients belonging to one of four categories that are referred to as risk groups for epidemiologic purposes sexually active homosexual or bisexual men roughly 3 4 of cases intravenous drug abusers about 17 Haitian entrants into the USA about 5 i and individuals with hemophilia 1 i. AIDS has developed in patients who have received blood products. Cases of apparent transplacental transmission have also been reported. Moreover, in certain parts of the world, such as Central Africa, the disease may be occurring in individuals who do not belong to one of the known AIDS risk groups. The expected survival for AIDS patients is less than two years after the diagnosis. A subset of patients with AIDS may develop Kaposi s sarcoma as the only initial manifestation of their disease and some patients in this subset have comparatively normal imnune function.Nevertheless, a progressive deterioration of imnune function is the rule. In those patients In whom Kaposi s sarcoma is life threatening in its own right, there may be a role for combination chemotherapy or certain interferon preparations. However, no therapy has been shown to reverse the clinical imnune impairment, and at present AIDS is considered to be a uniformly fatal disease. In the Spring of 1984 converging lines of investigation linked a cytopathic member of the human T cell leukemia virus family to the pathogenesis of AIDS.The retrovirus which is now thought to play a role in the etiology of AIDS patients is referred to as HTLV III sometimes also called human T lymphotropic virus , and the data implicating this virus in the causation of AIDS were collected in the Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology,DCT, NCI National Institutes of Health, Bethesda,Maryland by Dr. Gallo and his colleagues. There is strong data to suggest that patients with AIDS or precursor forms of AIDS harbor replicating virions of HTLV III and that this virus preferentially infects and the destroys 0KT4 helper inducer T cells. A high rate of replication and detectable viremia characterize the BTLV III infection seen in AIDS at least early in the disease. The discovery of a retrovirus linked to the causation of AIDS offers the clinician new strategies for the therapy of AIDS. All retroviruses including HTLV III require a unique enzyme called reverse transcriptase in their natural cycle of replication. Therefore, rugs which inhibit reverse transcriptase are candidates as experimental agents to block HTLV lII replication. In 1979, De Clercq reported in Cancer Letters, 8 9 22 1979 that Suramin, a well known anti trypanosomal agent, was a potent competitive inhibitor of the reverse transcriptase of animal retroviruses.Since the first paper by Gallo and his colleagues describing a human retrovirus was published in 1980, the recent discovery of HTLV III has re awakened interest in this agent as well as other agents known to inhibit reverse transcriptase . Recent studies connected with this invention have shown that the replication of HTLV III in vitro can be essentially completely inhibited at Suramin concentrations of 50 pg ml or greater, a dose which is achievable in human beings according to the published experience with this drug.Therapeutic Background of Suramin Suramin is the sodium salt of 8,8 carbonyl bis imino 3,1 phenylenecarbonylimino 4 methyl 3,1 phenylene carbonyliminoi bis 1,3,5 naphthalenetri sulfonic acid see formula supra . Suramin was introduced by Bayer DR in 1920 as a cure for African sleeping sickness. The drug was found to be very valuable for the therapy of human trypanosomiasis, although its mechanism of action is obscure, During recent years, it has been supplahted by newer agents for this disease.In the 1940 s it was discovered that Suramin also acted on onchocerciasis although trypanosomes and onchocercal worms are very different organismsi, and it is available on a limited basis in the United States for the therapy of this disease. For the adult worms of 0. volvulus,Suramin may be the only effective compound available to physicians, and it is considered to have an acceptable safety record if administered with careful supervision.It has been given to 27,000 cases in Venezuela without any deaths or serious ill effects. Suramin has also been used in the treatment of non parasitic diseases. For example, during the 1930 s this drug was used to treat pemphigus, frequently in very high doses e.g., 10 gm in 19 days .Absorption and Administration Suramin is given by slow i.v. administration as a 10 aqueous solution made up by adding 10 ml to a 1 gram vial of dry powder. The drug is poorly absorbed by the oral route. When given by subcutaneous or intramus eular injection, it causes Intense local irritation, and suitable precautions are necessary to avoid leakage when the drug is given intravenously. After intravenous injection, Suramin combines with serum proteins and much of it circulates in the blood. It persists in the bloodstream for very long periods and its excretion in the urine is very slow.When repeated doses of 1 gram are given at 4 or 7 day intervals as in the therapy of trypanosomiasis , there is considerable accumulation in the plasma and concentrations as high as 340 micrograms ml may be reached.Recognized Toxicity in Humans Prom Suramin An understanding of the toxicity of this agent derives almost exclusively from its use in treating trypanosomiasis and onchocerciasis. It should be recognized that most of the available information comes from its use under very difficult field conditions. Patients who need this drug are sometimes debilitated from other causes and living on a starvation diet. In addition, some of the side effects described may be due to the release of toxic products by dead or dying worms. Imnediate reactions I Nausea and vomiting 2 Sudden collapse with nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, shock, and coma. Collapse may be preceded by a brief period of neuromuscular irritability and congestion of the face and body. One authority Apted estimated that this complication occurs in 1 2000 to 1 4500 cases. Patients likely to exhibit this reaction can be detected by administering a test dose 200 mg first. 3 Acute abdominal pain occurs rarely. 4 Urticarial eruptions. Late reactions 3 24 hours li sever 2 Photophobia and lachrymation, sometimes with palpebral edema. 3 Abdominal distension and constipation. 4 Cutaneous hyperesthesias of the soles and palms. The pain begins 24 hours after injection and may persist for a week or longer. The affected skin may desquamate. Delayed reactions after some daysj li Renal damage is the commonest toxic reaction. 2 Exfoliative dermatitis. In Venezuela this was observed in approximately 1 1000 cases.Outline of Therapeutic Parameters Developed and Utilized With This Invention 1 Concentration of Suramin in the blood.50 vg ml or greater was found to be effective and a range of 50 to 340 ug ml is clinically achievable in the blood.The presence of a virus of HTLV, presumably HTLV III, may be tested in vitro by a number of methods including immunofluorescence. See below, Example 1. The p24 antigen of HTLV III is a fraction of HTLV III. It is separated and used for assay purposes see Popovic, et al, Science, 224 503, May 4, 1984. 2 Administration i.v. by slow infusion of the dosage of Suramin. The present preferred regimen embodies a trial dosage at 0 days .2 mg followed by 4to 7 day increments of 1.0 grams at Days 3, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35, totaling 6.2 grams of Suramin in aqueous sterile, which is obtained by dissolving 1 g of solid Suramin in 10 ml of sterile water. 3j Diseases treated. Although AIDS, a disease sterrining from HTLV IIIb is the primary target, other related diseases such as pre AIDS lymphadenopathy syndrome , Kaposi s sarcoma and human T cell leukemia lymphoma are included within the scope of the invention. As exemplary for purposes of the present invention, an inhibition of in vivo viral replication is defined as a cessation of HTLV III replication in the patient with HTLV III antigenemia taken to signify in vivo replication. In the present invent ion, a number of methods may be used to monitor the effectiveness of the drug in patients in addition to following their clinical course.These include following the ratio of T4 T8 lymphocytes, the ability to isolate live virus at various times, measuring for the presence of viral antigens, and other tests for the purposes of replicating virus. AIDS is an insidious and chronic disease, and especially early in the disease, clinical parameters often fluctuate. In the first group of patients tested with the drug, the clinical course is being monitored and, in addition, specimens are being frozen for testing and assay. In this in vivo invention is set out the find ing that Suramin can block the in vivo infectivity ofHTLV III in the form of cell free virions when assayed in the H9 target population, a line which expresses mature T cell markers but is permissive for HTLV III replication and only partially susceptible to its cytopathic effect. Also, the drug blocks the cytopathic effect of HTLV III against a normal OKT4 helper indueer T cell clone co cultured with HTLV III bearing H9 cells at concentrations of 50 vg ml 3,5x10 5 mol or greater, levels that are clinically attainable in human beings.Example 1 In this in vitro example see Fig. 1 , there was used clone H9 cells to investigate the inhibitory effect of Suramin on the infectivity of the HTLV III. H9 cells are permissive for the .replication of HTLV III. When the target H9 cells were exposed to the HTLV IIIB isolate in the form of cell free virions and cultured for 4 to 6 days in the absence of Suramin, 72 76 of the target H9 cell population became infected and began to produce the virus as determined by an indirect immuno fluorescence assay in which rabbit antibodies were used to detect expression of the HTLV IIIB p24 gag protein. A modest, but temporary, protective effect was observed when the H9 cells were cultured in the presence ofSuramin at a concentration of 10 ug ml. However, at concentrations of 100 vg ml and 1,000 vg ml, a striking protective effect was observed throughout the six day interval of culture.In addition, at these higher doses, the H9 population did not develop multiple nucleated giant cells with ring formation. The latter is a characteristic feature of HTLV III infection in these target cells. In connection with the results above and that shown in Figure 2, it is believed and shown that the low effective dosage of Suramin in vitro is 50 g ml. In determining whether Suramin could block the cytopathic effect of HTLV IIIB against a normal helper inducer T cell growth factor TCGF dependent T cell clone, co cultured with H9 cells producing HTLV IIIB, a known normal T cell clone YTA1 was used which displayed the following surface membrane phenotype OKT3 , OKT4 , HLA DR , Tac antigen , and OKT8 . In addition, YTA1 produced substantial quantities of TCGF and underwent a proliferative reaction in response to antigen in the presence of appropriate accessory cells. Moreover, YTA1 showed helper activity for imnunoglobulin production by normal B cells Matsushita et al, unpublished . Infection of H9 cells by HTLV IIIB was performed as follows The target H9 cells were preexposed to 10 oE3 , 100 11 , and 1,000 S g ml of Suramin for two hours, then to polybrene 2 g ml for 30 minutes before HTLV IIIB infection. Control H9 cells G were treated in a similar fashion, except they were not exposed to the drug.Then the H9 cells were centrifuged 800g and exposed to HTLV IIIB virus 0.5 ml containing 7.5x107 viral particles for 45 minutes and resuspended in fresh culture media RPMI 1640 supplemented with 20 heat inactivated fetal calf serum, 4 mM l glutamine, 50 U ml penicillin, and 50 50 ig ml streptomycin , and cultured in flasks at 370C in 5 C02 containing humidified air.The cells were continuously exposed to each concentration of Suramin. On days 4, 5, and 6 in culture, the percentage of the target H9 cells containing p24 gag protein of HTLV IIIB was determined by indirect imnunofluorescence microscopy as described by Popovic et al, Science 224 497 1984 . Cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline PBS and resuspended in the same buffer at a concentration of 106 cells per milliliter. Approximately 50 p1 of cell suspension were placed on a slide, air dried, and fixed in acetone for 10 minutes at room temperature. Slides were stored at 200C until use. Twenty microliters of rabbit antiserum to the p24 gag protein of HTLV III diluted 1 2,000 in PBS were applied to these preparations and incubated for 50 minutes at 370C.Then fluorescein conjugated goat antiserum to rabbit IgG Cappel Lab., Cochranville, PA was diluted and applied to the fixed cells for 30 minutes at room temperature. Slides were then washed extensively before microscopic examination under ultraviolet illumination Nikon Inc., Japan HBO 100w filter 450nm NCB10, magnification x320 . Example 2 The results of the experiment to determine the protective effect of Suramin on the survival and growth of a clone normal T cell population exposed to HTLV IIIB in vitro are shown in Figure 2. The YTAl target cells were pre exposed to various doses of Suramin for 12 hours and then co cultured with irradiated 10,000 rad HTLV IIIB bearing H9 cells, with the dose of Suramin kept constant during the entire time in culture. Uninfected, irradiated H9 cells were added under the same conditions as a control. All cultures contained 15 v v lectinfree TCGF. The total numbers of viable YTA1 cells as a function of time in culture were determined.In the absence of Suramin, the HTLV IIIB producing H9 cells had exerted a substantial cytopathic effect on the YTA1 popu lation by Day 8 in culture and by Day 10, the YTAl population was almost completely killed. The addition ofSuramin at concentrations of 50 Vg ml or greater enable the YTA1 target population to survive and grow in the presence of ITLV IIIB at concentrations of 100 pg ml or higher, the drug clearly blocked the cytopathic effect of the virus but did exert an inhibitory effect on the normal target T cell growth . Thus, Suramin can block the replication of HTLV IIIB in permissive H9 cells and can also inhibit the cytopathic effect of HTLV IIIB upon an OKT4 T cell clone. 2x105 YTA1 cells were exposed to various concentrations 0 150 g ml of Suramin for 12 hours in culture tubes 3033 Falcon in 2 ml of 15 TCGF vol vol Cellular Products Inc., Buffalo, NY containing RPMI 1640 supplemented with 15 heat inactivated fetal calf serum, 4iM l glutamine, 50 U ml penicillin, and 50 vg ml streptomycin at 370C in 5 C02 containing humidified air. Then these YTA1 cells were added with the equal number of irradiated 10,000 rad HTLV IIIB bearing H9 or uninfected H9 z cells. Control cells were cultured without any cells added. Cells were continuously exposed to Suramin and TCGF. The assays were all performed in duplicate.On days 6, 8 and 10 the total numbers of viable cells were counted in a hemocytometer under the microscope by using trypanblue dye exclusion method. When cultured alone in the presence ofTCGF, none of irradiated HTLV IIIB bearing H9 or uninfected H9 cells were alive on day 6 in culture. Normal YTAl cells could be readily distinguished from neoplasticH9 cells by morphology. The YTA1 target cells had been stimulated by soluble tetanus toxoid antigen plus irradi ated 4,000R autologous accessory cells six days prior to these experiments as part of a cycle of restimulations. Each bar represents the mean number of viable cells 1 S.D. of duplicate determinations. The dashed horizontal line depicts the starting number of YTA1 cells. Most of what is known about the clinical pharmacology of Suramin derives from its use in the therapy of trypanosomiasis and onchocerciasis. After intravenous injection, the drug combines with serum proteins and much of it circulates in the blood. It persists in the bloodstream for very long periods and its excretion in the urine is very slow. The therapeutic regimens in use result in considerable accumulation in the plasma frequently in excess of 100 vg mlj. Indeed, concentrations as high as 340 pglml may be reached under some conditions. These concentrations exceed those found to block the infectivity Fig. 1 and cytopathic effect Pig. 2 of HTLV III. Therapeutic Response and Results In the treatment of one increment of patients suffering from AIDS illness they were given the treatment regimen of one to six weeks or 35 days administered after a preliminary dose of .2 gram each week by infusion intravenous therapy. Alternate dosages of Suramin from the above may be utilized but the controlling factor would be that a blood level in the patient 50 p g ml or greater is achieved. In the initial increment of patients the recognized main toxicities in humans, such as renal allergy, shock and exfoliative dermatitis, did not occur. Additionally, a level of 50 pg ml or greater in the blood stream was observed. The course of treatment is a long term one.
