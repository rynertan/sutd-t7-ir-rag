# Improvement in the process for preparing biaryl compounds via coupling of an arylamine with an arene.

## Abstract
Improvement in the process for preparing biaryl com pounds via coupling of an arylamine with an arene in the pres ence of a nitrite, an acid and copper metal or a derivative there of the improvement is consisting in adding to the reaction mixture a trialkylorthoformate. The process may be used for preparing drugs such as Flurbiprofen and Xenbucin or inter mediate compounds particularly useful for preparing Flurbi profen, Flufenisal, Chlordimorin Xenbucin, Xenysalate, Xeny hexenic acid and the like.
