# Pre Folded packaged tape for electrical conductors.

## Abstract
A traversed package is formed from a tape which is slit from a laminate composed of a metallic foil layer and a dielectric insulating layer of plastic film, with a longitudinal edge or edges thereof folded back against the surface of the tape. The packaged tape can be applied to twisting conduc tors in a cabling process either helically or longitudinally with the folded edge or edges preventing the foil layer from electrical contact with adjacent conductors or shields.
