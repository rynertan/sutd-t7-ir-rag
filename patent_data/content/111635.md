# METHOD OF SELECTING THE OPTIMUM FOCUSING ADJUSTMENT FOR AN OPTICAL INSTRUMENT

## Abstract
The method for automatically focusing an optical instru ment such as for example microscope or the like comprises the steps of selecting a clear object area within the field for analysis, varying the focus and measuring and recording the size of the clear object area image as a function of the focus adjustment and selecting that focus adjustment wherein the clear object area has a maximum image size as the position of optimum focus. The method may also be practised by selecting an opaque area and selecting the minimum image size as corresponding to the optimum focus position. It is also possible to have selection of a clear and of an opaque object area. This method could be applied for example to measurement with microscopes for control of photomasks used in semiconductor integrated circuits manufacture.
