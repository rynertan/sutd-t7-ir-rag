# Mechanical seal assembly.

## Abstract
The stationary seal 12 ring being connected to a stationary housing by elastomeric keys 36 . In the absence or upon failure of the fluid film, the rings 12 16 can seize, generally resulting in a breakage of or other damage to the more brittle seal ring. However, the elastomeric connecting keys provide a cushion for absorbing dynamic forces in the tangential direction, to distribute bearing loads substan tially evenly and to allow radial deflections of the stationary seal ring relative to the housing due to thermal and pressure effects.
