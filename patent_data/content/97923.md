# Metal oxide varistor.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a metal oxide varistor comprising a component of grain bodies composed of zinc oxide and a component of grain boundary layers composed of another metallic oxide, characterized in that at least a portion of these starting materials is a fine particle powder prepared by a co precipitation method. The method oxide varistor of the present invention is excellent in varistor characteristics such as non linearity to voltage, life performances and capability of energy dissipa tion, is small in a scatter of the above characteristics between manufacture lots or within each lot at the time of manufac ture, and has a good quality stability.
