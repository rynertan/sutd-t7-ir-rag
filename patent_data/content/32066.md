# Device for cleaning conveyor belts.

## Abstract
A cleaning device 4 for cleaning a conveyor belt 1 1a, 1b comprises a cleaning member 7 mounted on a lever 6 which can move angularly about a pivot axis extending trans verse to the run of the belt 1 1a, 1b , the lever 6 also carrying a pressure member 5 arranged to contact the face of the belt 1b opposite to the face to be cleaned, the cleaning member 7 being urged into contact with the surface of the belt 1b by the reaction of the pressure member 5 to movement of the belt 1 1a, 1b causing angular movement of the lever 6 about its pivot axis. The pressure member 5 and cleaning member 7 may be resiliently urged towards one another in the direction of the axis of the lever 6 to enable wear of the cleaning member 7 to be compensated automatically whilst reducing the angle through which the lever 6 pivots during the useful life of the cleaning member 7 .
