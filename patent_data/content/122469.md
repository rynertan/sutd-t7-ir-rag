# Lubricating mechanism for scroll type fluid displacement apparatus.

## Abstract
A lubricating mechanism for a scroll type fluid displace ment apparatus is disclosed. A driving mechanism 13, 131, 132 for an orbiting scroll 23 comprises a drive shaft 13 and a drive pin 131 projecting at an eccentric location from an inner end surface of the drive shaft 13 . An annular boss 233 projecting from a circular end plate 231 of the orbiting scroll 23 receives the drive pin 13 . Therefore, the orbiting scroll 23 is rotatably supported on the drive pin 13 . The lubricat ing mechanism includes an oil passageway 33 formed in the circular end plate 231 of the orbiting scroll 23 to communi cate between the interior of the boss 233 and one of the fluid pockets located at the outer peripheral portion of the spiral elements 222, 232 . Lubricating oil thus flows into the interior of the boss 233 and lubricates the bearing 30 and other contact surface disposed in the center portion of the apparatus.
