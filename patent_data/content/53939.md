# Digital phase locked loop pull in circuitry.

## Abstract
Circuitry is provided for assessing phase difference between first f The first signal f On the basis of the signs, absolute values and amplitude ratio of the two sample values y₀, y₁ phase difference between the first and second signals can be assessed employing a conversion table which can deal with only phase angles in the range from 0 to π4 radians.
