In general the process is directed to reacting propionaldehyde, a secondary amine, and a haloacrylonitrile in a stepwiseMichael type addition to form an amino substituted methylcyclobutanecarbonitrile intermediate which is thereafter subjected to acid hydrolysis to form valeronitrile or pentenonitrile derivatives which are thereafter cyclized to form 2 halo or 2 hydroxy 5methylpyridines. Various 4 5 halomethyl 2 pyridyloxy phenoxy compounds are known to be useful as herbicides as disclosed in European Published Patent Application No.483, United Kingdom Patent Specifications 1,599,121 and 1,599,126 and U.S. Patents 4,184,041 and 4,317,913.For example, butyl 2 4 5 trifluoromethyl 2 pyridyloxy phenoxy propionate which is also known as fluazifopbutyl is an effective grass herbicide which can be used in fields where broad leaved crops such as cotton and soybeans are cultivated. Important starting materials for such pyridyloxyphenoxy compounds are the 2 halo 5 trichloromethylpyridines such as 2 chloro 5 trichloro methylpyridine described in U.S. Patent 4,317,913.
