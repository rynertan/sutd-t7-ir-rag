# Device for transferring fluid to a rotating tool holder.

## Abstract
A device for transferring fluid to a rotating holder 11 for a tool 12 for chipforming machining comprises a locking means 28 which is adapted to non rotatably connect the holder 11 to a housing 20 when the holder 11 is removed from the machine tool. The housing 20 is arranged on the holder 11 and carries the locking means 28 . For purposes of decreasing the risk that the housing 20 becomes nonuniformly loaded when the holder 11 is connected to the machine tool the locking means 28 is adapted to release the holder 11 from the housing 20 upon an application of a radially acting force on the locking means 28 .
