# Color picture tube magnetic shielding and degaussing structure.

## Abstract
A combined magnetic shielding and degaussing struc ture for an in line color picture tube 21 comprises magnetiz able shielding plates 34 37 of an extended surface area each located at a corner of the picture tube and two vertically oriented magnetizable strips 40.41 . Each strip connects upper and lower corner shielding plates together on a respec tive side of the picture tube. The shielding plates guide stray magnetic flux into the strips and away from the picture tube interior in order to provide magnetic shielding. A degaussing winding 44 45 is wound around the vertical axis of each strip and generates a degaussing flux which flows through the shielding plates and into the color picture tube shadow mask.
