# Dry etching apparatus and method using reactive gas.

## Abstract
A dry etching apparatus is disclosed which uses reactive gases and which is capable of achieving anisotropic etching without causing radiation damage to a workpiece 10 to be selectively etched. The workpiece is placed in a vacuum con tainer 11 into which two feedstock gases are introduced. One of the gases contributes to the etching, while the other forms a film on the side wall of the etched portion of the workpiece 10 , the film protecting it against lateral etching. A first beam 26 which dissociates the first feedstock gas is perpendicu larly directed toward the workpiece 10 , whereas a second beam 27 which dissociates the second feedstock gas is directed in the general direction of the workpiece 10 .
