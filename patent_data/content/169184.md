# Method of manufacturing an absorption body for use in disposable products as diapers, sanitary napkins or wound dressings.

## Abstract
A fibrous absorption body having a continuous density gradient in a direction perpendicular to its largest surfaces, to be used in disposable products such as diapers, sanitary napkins or wound dressings, manufactured by air laying a blend of cellulose fluff pulp and a binder,the latter preferably in the form of fibres, preheating 9 the formed low density web 8 to at least the binding temperature for the bonding fibres, compressing 10 the web 8 , passing the web 8 through a cooling zone 11 and finally achieving the density gradient in the web 8 by compressing it between a pair of rollers 12 of which the upper one 14 is cold and only the lower one 13 is heated to reach the binding temperature of the bonding fibres anew, the web density thereby con tinuously increasing in the direction from the cold roller 14 towards the hot roller 13 . By using special embossing means disposed at the hot roller 13 , the web 8 can be provided with an unbroken surface pattern for increasing the liquid distribution capacity.
