# High titer cytomegalovirus human immune serum globulin and method of making same.

## Abstract
Normal plasma from donors who have not been vaccinat ed with a cytomegalovirus vaccine can be screened for higher than normal titers of naturally occurring antibody to cytomega lovirus. Those plasmas with high titers of such antibody can be pooled and fractionated to give hyperimmune serum globulin. The product may be treated to render it suitable for intrave nous injection. Patients with cytomegalovirus infection or at risk to such infection, may receive the present product to raise serum titers of cytomegalovirus antibody.
