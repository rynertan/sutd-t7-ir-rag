# Motor vehicle transmissions.

## Abstract
A motor vehicle transmission mechanism has a first speed driving train 4 1 on one side of an intermediate wall 1b of a casing 1 and a reverse driving train 4 R on the other side of the intermediate wall 1b . Also on this other side are a second speed driving train 4 2 and a third speed driving train 4 3 . A fourth speed driving train 4 4 is positioned between the second speed driving train 4 2 and a reverse driving train 4 R . The clutches of a double clutch 11 constitute a second speed clutch 12 for the second speed driving train 4 2 and a fourth speed clutch 15 for the fourth speed driving train 4 4 . A reverse driving gear 18 for the reverse driving train 4 R is fast for rotation with a fourth speed driving gear 16 on the output side of the fourth speed clutch 15 . A fourth speed driven gear 17 meshed with the fourth speed driving gear 16 and a reverse driven gear 19 meshed with the reverse driving gear 18 through an idler gear can be selectively connected for rotation with the output shaft 3 by operation of a selection mechanism 20 .
