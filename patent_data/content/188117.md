# System for adjusting signal transmission timing in time division multiplexing signal transmission.

## Abstract
A time division multiplexing communication network comprising a central station 1 and a plurality of local stations 2a to 2n , in which information signals Dl1 to Dln are transmitted from the local stations to the central station on a time division multiplexing basis, and the central station transmits information signals DO1 to DOn to the local stations on a time division multiplexing basis. The central station sequentially requests that local stations transmit a test signal in order to prevent collision of transmission signals from the local stations. Each local station, of which a test signal transmission is requested, transmits the test signal to the central station. The central station sends back the test signal to the local station which transmitted this test signal. The local station measures transmission delay time from transmission to reception of the test signal, and adjusts transmission timing of the information signal to be transmit ted to the central station based on the measured delay time.
