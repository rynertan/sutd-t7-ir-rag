# AN AIRCRAFT UNDERCARRIAGE

## Abstract
The undercarriage includes a pair of pivotally intercon nected undercarriage legs 32, 33, the latter of which carries a ground wheel 15. A strut 14 extends between lugs 31, 34 on the legs. The strut may either be frangible or fluid operable and normally inhibits relative pivotal movement of the legs. However, if a load in excess of a desired load is applied to the undercarriage, the strut will operate to permit such relative movement. At the limit of such relative movement the lowest point L of the wheel 15 will be below the lowest point P of the undercarriage.
