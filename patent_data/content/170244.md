# Process for producing by product oxygen from turbine power generation.

## Abstract
A method is set forth for the generation of net power and the recovery of by product oxygen enriched gas at low power requirements. Air is compressed to elevated tempera ture and pressure, at least a portion of the air is combusted and a portion of the oxygen is removed from the air or combustion effluent through a membrane or adsorbent before the oxygen lean combustion effluent is expanded through a turbine to recover power for the process and net power.
