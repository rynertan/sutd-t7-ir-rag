# Supporting apparatus of a seat of a chair.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a supporting apparatus of a seat 2 of a chair in order to be able to sit on the seat keeping the backbone in a state of proper posture when one sits on it, and the chair is constructed in that the supporting leg 1 fixed under the seat 2 is statably supported on a pedestal 4 and does not incline over an angle more than 15 by means of retaining device.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. Supporting apparatus of a seat of a chair in which an extreme point of one supporting leg fixed on the lower surface of a seat of a chair is rotatable in a bearing part of a pedestal and there is provided with means to prevent an angle of an inclination of the leg to become more than 150. 2. Supporting apparatus according to Claim 1 in which the means to prevent an angle of an inclination of the leg to be more than 150 is a ring supported to the pedestal. 3. Supporting apparatus according to Claim 1 in which the means to prevent an angle of an inclination of the leg to be more than 150 is a stop metal fittings which holds the extreme point on the pedestal.

## Description
The present invention relates to a supporting apparatus of a seat of a chair for furniture or business, and more particularly to a supporting apparatus of a seat on which one must sit straight at the same time when he always keeps the backbone of his body at a normal position, and it is useful to improve the condition of one s health. Up to this time, in a chair for furniture or business, except an easy chair and a rocking chair, it is ordinary that the seat keeps balance, and the seat cannot but transform and move in a extent that the seat rotates or a inclination of a back of a chair is done in a case of being provided with it. And when one sits on such a chair, his body becomes stable in obedience to the condition of the chair and he does not need his force to hold that state.When one sits on the chair, to hold the backbone straightly is necessary not to set up lumbago and the like, but as in case one sits on the existing chair, one can sit on keeping equilibrium even in an improper posture to a certain extent, one is apt to assume an improper posture. This invention has been done to offer a supporting apparatus of a seat of a chair on which seat one must sit keeping always in a proper posture. According to this invention to be intended to eliminate the fault above mentioned, when one sits on the seat and holds his backbone in a proper posture, one supporting leg supports the seat in a proper posture, and when one s posture is changed, said supporting leg would move, and the equilibrium would be lost, and therefore, feeling for sitting become unpleasant, so that one returns his posture in a proper position, and then he needs not Worce to keep his body to the proper posture. An angle of inclination of one supporting leg of the seat increases, the chair would fall down. In order to prevent this falling down, there is provided means for retaining the supporting leg not to incline over an angle more than 150. Consequently, the supporting apparatus of the seat of the chair according to this invention is characterized in that an extreme point of one supporting leg fixed on the lower surface of the seat of a chair is rotatable in a bearing portion of a pedestal and there is provided with means to prevent an angle of an inclination of the leg to become more than 150. Other features and advantages of the present invention are set forth in or apparent from the detailed description of a preferred embodiments of the invention found hereinbelow. Figure 1 is a side view of a chair constructed in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention Figure 2 is a plane view sighted along a line II II of Figure 1 Figure 9 is a schematic diagram of the chair of the invention in use with a man Figure 4 is a cross sectional view of a portion of a chair constructed with the other embodiment of the invention Figure 5 is a similar diagram of Figure 1 of a chair constructed in accordance with a further embodiment of the invention, and Figure 6 is a perspective view of the chair shown in Figure 5. Referring to Figures 1 and 2, there is shown a front view and a plan view of the chair of the present invention, the extreme point of one supporting leg 1 which is fixed on a center portion of a lower surface of the sheat 2, is freely put in a bearing part 3 provided on a center of the upper surface of the pedestal 4. A circular ring 5 is supported on said pedestal 4 by plural supporting rods 6. Said circular ring 5 has a function that said supporting leg 1 is prevented from inclining at an angle of more than 150 centering around said bearing portion 3.In the drawings numeral 7 represents the back of a chair. Figure 3 shows in the schematic diagram that when one sits down on the chair according to the present invention, his backbone and legs are in a nomal state. Figures 4 and 5 are representing other embodiments of means which prevents said supporting leg from inclining at an angle more than 150. In Figure 4, the extreme point of the supporting leg 1 is formed in a shape of globular form 8, and which is put in a hemispherical open space provided on the bearing portion 3 of the pedestal 4 and covered with a stop metal fittings 9. By means of an opentng 10 provided appropriately on said fittings 9, the inclination of the supporting leg 1 will be limited.In Figure 5, the hemispherical open space is provided on a metal fittings 11 inserted into a short tube 12 which is fixed on the center of the pedestal 4 , and on which a hemispherical extreme point 8 of the supporting leg 1 is put, and a stop metal fittings 9t is fixed on said short tube 12 by screw. As a constricted portion 13 passes through the opening 10 of said fittings 9 , the inclination of said supporting leg 1 will be limited in order not to exceed an angle more than 150. The fact hereafter mentioned is not concerning of the construction according to the present invention, it is better to make able to adjust the height of the seat 2 by means of that a screwed rod 14 fixed on the lower surface of said seat 2 is screwed in the upper end free leg 1 , and said leg 1 is turned relatively to the seat 2 by a handle 15. Furthermore, it is better to provide a cover 16 made by elastic material e.g., a plastic material, around the leg 1 and a metal fittings 9 for good outwards appearance and protection. Figure 6 represents a perspective view of the chair shown in Figure 5.In the embodiment represented in Figures 1 and 2, the chair cannot be moved by holding the seat in one s hands, but in the embodiments represented in Figures 4 and 5, it can be done.
