## Description
Wave Power Generator The present invention provides a power generator which utilises the energy of wave action, and to a lesser degree wind and current action, to achieve power output. The rapid depletion and decreased availability of fossil fuels has generated a great deal of interest in alternate sources of energy. Moreover, after experience with an energy resource which can be depleted, sources of energy are being investigated which are continuous in nature, and not subject to depletion. Primarily, such interest is centred on solar energy and wind energy. However, another source of such energy, which has received little meaningful attention, is wave energy. The present invention provides apparatus for deriving power output from wave energy. A rotatable member is provided which is capable of rotating in only one direction. Floats are provided which rise and fall in response to wave action, and thereby move relative to the rotatable member.The floats are coupled to the rotatable member so that the movement of the floats rotates the rotatable member in its available direction to provide power output. In its preferred form, the present invention provides an elongate floating barge flanked by a pair of elongate floats. Transverse movement of the floats relative to the barge is limited.A rotatable power output shaft is mounted on the barge parallel to the elongate floats. A plurality of pulleys circumscribe the shaft and are spaced along its length. Tension members attached to the floats circumscribe the respective pulleys to rotate the pulleys and thereby the shaft as the floats move relative to the barge to achieve power output. In the present invention, the plurality of tension members can be connected to the pulleys along different paths so that various movements of the floats all cause rotation of the shaft in its desired direction. Specifically, not only can the up and down motion of the floats generated by the waves be utilised, but their rocking motion can be utilised as well. This combination vastly increases output. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, wind and current vanes are used to aid in the rocking of the floats. Since the present invention, in its preferred form, utilises the rocking motion of the floats as well as their up and down motion to generate power output, these alternate energy sources act as a bonus. The present invention provides an efficient and direct mechanism for transforming wave action into shaft rotation, which can be used to generate different types of power, usually electrical. A secondary advantage of the present invention is that it can be constructed to a large extent from existing surplus materials. Specifically, the floats used in the present invention can comprise ships which are no longer in service.The barge can be an existing barge suitable for carrying the power shaft and a generator operated by the shaft. As a result, it is contemplated that the present invention can be implemented at relatively minor cost. The novel features which are believed to be characteristic of the invention, both as to organisation and method of operation, together with further objects and advantages thereof, will be better understood from the following description considered in connection with the accompanying drawings in which a preferred embodiment of the invention is illustrated by way of example. It is to be expressly understood, however, that the drawings are for the purpose of illustration and description only and are not intended as a definition of the limits of the invention. In the drawings Figure 1 is a perspective view of the preferred embodiment of the present invention Figure 2 is a plan view of the embodiment ofFigure 1 Figure 3 is an elevation view taken along lines 3 3 of Figure 1 and Figure 4 is a fragmentary sectional view of one of the pulleys of the embodiment of Figure 1. The preferred embodiment 10 of the wave power generator of the present invention is illustrated by way of reference to Figures 1 3 in combination.A central barge 12 is mounted between two elongate floats 13, 14. It is contemplated that floats 13, 14 can constitute ships which are no longer in service. Floats 13, 14 are connected to barge 12 by pins 15, 16 respectively. Pins 15, 16 have balls at their ends which engage sockets 18 mounted on the floats and the barge. A pair of bungee ropes 19, 20 interconnect the ends of barge 12 and float 13, as illustrated in Figure 2. A similar pair of bungee ropes 21, 22 interconnect the ends of barge 12 and float 14. The bungee ropes together with pins 15, 16 allow the floats to move vertically relative to barge 12 and rock from side to side but limit the transverse movement of the floats relative to the barge. Each float 13, 14 has a mast structure 24 which supports a plurality of wind vanes 26. Wind vanes 26 are cycled between a closed position, in which the vanes in combination provide a flat surface, and an open position in which the vanes are parallel. Floats 13,14 are adapted to be aligned perpendicular to the wind. Accordingly, when wind vanes 26 are closed, they will provide a flat surface to the wind, and the wind will rock the boat in a downwind direction. When vanes 26 are opened to allow the wind to pass between the vanes, the floats will rock to windward. The opening and closing of wind vanes 26 is cycled to achieve a resonance effect to maximise the rocking of the floats. A plurality of current vanes 28 are provided under each float 13,14. Floats 13, 14 are adapted to be aligned parallel to the direction of any current flow in the flotation medium. Current vanes 28 on each float 13,14 are adapted to be aligned parallel to the direction of any current flow in the flotation medium. Current vanes 28 on each float 13, 14 are divided into sets on opposite sides of the float. Vanes 28 are cycled alternately so that the current causes a rocking motion of floats 13, 14. The cycling of current vanes 28 is coordinated with that of wind vanes 26 to achieve a maximum rocking action of floats 13, 14. A plurality of tension members, typically cables or chains, extend from each float 13, 14 to barge 12. A first tension member 30 extends from the top of the hull of float 14, passes beneath an idler pulley 32 located at the bottom of barge 12, upwardly along the side of barge 12, and over an idler pulley 34 at the top of the barge. From idler pulley 34, tension member 30 passes downwardly into barge 12 and around a pulley 36 mounted on a rotatable shaft 38 within the barge. A second tension member 40 is attached to the hull of float 14 at its bottom, passes upwardly to an idler pulley 42 at the upper edge of barge 12, and downwardly into the barge, wrapping around pulley 44 on shaft 38. A third tension member 46 is attached to the top of the hull of float 14, passes over an idler pulley 48 at the top of barge 12, and wraps around pulley 50 on shaft 38. A fourth tension member 52 runs from the bottom of the hull of float 14, around an idler pulley 54 at the bottom of barge 12, over a second idler pulley 56 at the top of the barge, and around pulley 58 on shaft 38. In order to maintain tension members 30, 40, 46 and 52 in tension, cables 60 63 pass around pulleys 36, 44, 50, 54 respectively in the same direction as the associated tension members. Cables 60 63 pass over idler pulleys 64 67 and weights such as 68 are suspended therefrom in channels 70 73. The pattern of cables 30, 40, 46, 52 is repeated along the entire length of barge 12 and float 14. In each set, the tension members pass from the float 14 to barge 12 along different paths, and from different vertical positions on the float. Accordingly, as float 14 moves vertically relative to barge 12 as a result of wave action, and rocks back and forth as a result of combined wave, wind and current action, all of this relative movement causes tension members 30, 40, 46 and 52 to rotate their associated pulleys. Corresponding sets of tension members pass between float 13 and barge 12, and pass around pulleys mounted on shaft 38. For convenience, these tension members, pulleys and associated elements are given prime numbers corresponding to their mirror image elements associated with float 14.Accordingly, vertical movement and rocking motion of float 13 also results in an extension and contraction of the tension members attached thereto relative to their associated pulleys on shaft 38. A typical pulley arrangement 44 is illustrated by way of reference to Figure 4. A pair of collars 92, 93 are fixed to shaft 38 by screws 74. A spool 76 is located between collars 92, 93 and is rotatable with respect to shaft 38. Spool 76 is connected to collar 93 by a pawl and ratchet assembly 78 which provides a one way clutch. That is, when spool 76 is rotated in one direction, pawl and ratchet 78 force shaft 38 to rotate with the spool. However, spool 76 is really rotatable relative to shaft 38 in the opposite direction. A divider 80 is provided on spool 76. Tension member 40 is wrapped around one portion of spool 76, and the end of tension member 40 is welded to the spool. Weighted cable 61 is wrapped around spool 76 in the same direction as tension member 40. Shaft 38 is controlled so that it is rotatable in only one direction. Tension member 40 is wrapped around spool 76 in the direction that will cause the spool to rotate in the rotatable direction of shaft 38 when it is under tension. Pawl and ratchet 78 provides a connection between the spool and the shaft in this direction. Weighted cable 61 provides a biasing force on spool 76 tending to rotate it in the opposite direction from tension member 40, and thus maintains tension member 40 in continuous tension. All of the pulleys are generally similar in construction to pulley 44. Referring back to Figures 1 3, shaft 38 is mounted using a plurality of bearings 82 85. AlthouSn not explicitly shown in the drawings, the pulleys and their associated tension members are located along the entire length of shaft 38. A fly wheel 86 is mounted at the centre of shaft 38 and connects to electrical generator 88. The continuous rotation of shaft 38 caused by the movement of the tension members is transmitted through fly wheel 86 to generator 88 to generate electrical power. This method eliminates the costly two shaft system and all its gears and also allows the use of tiny counterweights instead of counterweights weighing 50t of the floats. While a preferred embodiment of the present invention has been illustrated in detail, it is apparent that modifications and adaptations of that embodiment will occur to those skilled in the art. For example, various arrangements of tension members, pulleys and the like could be used to achieve the object of the present invention.However, it is to be expressly understood that such modifications and adaptations are within the spirit and scope of the present invention, as set forth in the following claims.
