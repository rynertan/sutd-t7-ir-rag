## Description
Improvements in or relating to materials The present invention relates to materials and more particularly to synthetic rock materials. According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a process for the preparation of a synthetic rock material which includes the step of gelling a feed material thereby to form a precursor for the synthetic rock material, said feed material comprising appropriate chemical compounds as hereinafter defined and at least one of the chemical compounds being in the form of a colloidal dispersion of a hydrated chemical compound. It is to be understood that appropriate chemical compounds as used in this Specification means chemical compounds which are appropriate for providing the required chemical composition of the synthetic rock material when formed. For example if it is desired to have oxides of titanium, aluminium and zirconium in the synthetic rock material when formed the feed material will contain compounds of titanium, aluminium and zirconium as appropriate chemical compounds . In one embodiment of the present invention the feed material includes titanium dioxide in the form of a colloidal dispersion of hydrated titanium dioxide. It is preferred that the colloidal dispersion of hydrated titanium oxide is a sol as disclosed in BritishPatent Specification Number 1412937. Other appropriate chemical compounds may be present in the feed material as colloidal dispersions thus for example, in addition to a colloidal dispersion of hydrated titanium dioxide the feed material may contain a colloidal dispersion of zirconia e.g. such as a sol disclosed inBritish Patent Specification Number 1181794 US 3518050,US 3645910 and or a colloidal dispersion of alumina e.g. a sol as disclosed in British Patent Specification Number 1193258 . The precursor may be further treated to produce a synthetic rock material by pressing and heating firing . Synthetic rock materials have been proposed for use in the immobilisation of radioactive wastes and in this context reference may be made for example to Safe disposal of high level nuclear reactor wastes A new strategy byA.E. Ringwood Australian National University Press,Canberra, Australia and Norwalk, Conn., U.S.A. 1978 wherein reference is made, inter alia, to a synthetic analogue of a natural igneous rock. In certain known processes for the preparation of synthetic rock materials the precursor produced is of a relatively low density and this can give rise to difficulties during the pressing and firing when it is desired to obtain a high density synthetic rock material. In accordance with the present invention it is possible to produce a precursor which has a tap density of greater than 1 g. ml l Such a precursor may be pressed to give a synthetic rock material of substantially theoretical density. It is believed that the choice of colloidal dispersions including hydrated chemical compounds is a contributing factor in achieving a precursor of high density since in such colloidal dispersions the chemical compounds are in a non aggregated form and have small crystallite sizes of a shape and character such that packing can occur to give a dense precursor for a synthetic rock material. By way of example precursors have been prepared, in accordance with the present invention, which have a tap density in the range 1.3 g. ml l to 1.35 g. ml l By way of further example precursors have been prepared, in accordance with the present invention, which have a density in the range 1.6 1.7 g. ml l The precursor may be, for example, heated at relatively low temperature e.g. about 400 C to give a heat treated precursor suitable for further heating and pressing to give a synthetic rock material. By way of example, heat treated precursors have been prepared in accordance with present invention which have a density in the range 1.8 2.0 g. ml l The feed material may be gelled to give the precursor by any suitable means.Any method giving rise to a sol gel transformation is in principle applicable to the gelation of the feed material in accordance with the present invention. For example the gelling may be carried out by dewatering e.g. by evaporation or organic dewatering . By way of further example the feed material may be dispersed as droplets in an immiscible organic liquid and subsequently gelled by use of a long chain aliphatic amine or ammonia gas for example as disclosed in British PatentSpecification No. 1266494 . By way of further example the gelling may be carried out by evaporation. By way of yet further example, a sol gel transformation may be effected using spray drying. In accordance with another aspect of the present invention there is provided a precursor for a synthetic rock material said precursor having a density of greater than 1 g. ml Ú. The present invention will now be further described by way of example only as follows Example 1 A feed material was prepared with appropriate composition for the preparation of a precursor for a synthetic rock material comprising approximately 60 w oHollandite 65.5 TiO2, 13. 9 A1203 20.2 BaO and 40 w o Zironolite 47. 58 TiO2, 36. 0 ZrO2 16.5 CaO . Thus a feed material was prepared with the following proportions as the objective 58.3 TiO2, 14.4 ZrO2, 12.1 BaO, 8.3 A1203 and 6.6 CaO as follows 20 ml 6g TiO2 of TiO2 sol as disclosed inBritish Patent Specification No. 1412937 were mixed with 3ml N1.5g ZrO2 of ZrO2 sol as disclosed in BritishPatent Specification No. 1181794 and with 10 ml 1gA1203 of an alumina sol as disclosed in BritishPatent Specification No. 1193258 by stirring for N 10 minutes. No increase in viscosity and no coagulation was observed . Barium acetate 2g 1. 2g BaO was disolved in water and added to the mixture of sols prepared above to give a mixture. Only a slight tendency to coagulate was observed and viscosity increased. The mixture was stabilised by a few drops of concentrated nitric acid. 0.65g CaO was added to the mixture as slightly acid calcium nitrate solution he 5ml . The resulting feed material became thixotropic after 10 minutes and remained unchanged for the next 2 hours. The volume was N 40ml, the density was 1.17g. ml l and the pH was 2.4. The total oxide content was 250 g.1 1 TiO2 58 , ZrO2 14 , A1203 9 , BaO 11 andCaO 6 .Example 2 Feed material 15ml prepared as in Example 1 was dispersed by stirring in 300ml of immiscible organic liquid 1.1.1 trichloroethane Genklenew Trade Mark containing 3.0 ml of surfactant Span 80 Trade Mark and gelled by addition of NH3 gas as disclosed in British PatentSpecification No. 1266494 . The resulting spherical gel particles were separated from the organic liquid, washed in acetone and air dried. The resulting particles which were 50 100 P m dia were heated at 400 500 C for 5 mins after which they were crushed by light pressure to give a powder precursor of tap density 1.3 g. ml l Example 3 Feed material 20ml prepared as in Example 1 was rapidly evaporated in a dish, heated to 400 5000C for 5 mins and the then crushed by light pressure to give a powder precursor of tap density 1.35g ml l, Example 4 Powder precursor prepared as in Example 3 was hot pressed under vacuum at a pressure of 2.3 Kg mm 2 for one hour at 11500C to give a synthetic rock material having a pressed density of 4.18 g. ml l 95 TheoreticalDensity .
