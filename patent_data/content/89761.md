# Passivated catalytic rich gas reforming catalysts.

## Abstract
Passivated coprecipitated nickel alumina catalysts are provided which require minimal reactivation treatment for use as primary steam reforming gasification catalysts and no reactivation treatment when used for catalysing methanation reactions. The catalysts are prepared by conventional copre cipitation techniques but are calcined at temperatures in excess of 480 C and reduced at temperatures less than 600 C. Passivation is effected by conditioning at 175 to 200 in carbon dioxide.
