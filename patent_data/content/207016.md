## Description
The ever present request of available room in hou sing premises is known, this being particularly true for caravans, campers, boats and similar, whe rein the available room must be apted to be utilized in the most intense possible way. In said premises or ambients, the space occupi ed by a table is very often to be allotted to other uses in relation with the different hours of the day, through the disappearance of the table itself or for its utilization at different levels from the floor. For instance, in the room allotted to living room in vehicles of the aforesaid type, the table may be made to disappear when the ambient is desti ned to living room, must be arranged at a certain height between the divans when it is utilized as a dinner table or a gaming table and must be arran ged at the height of the divans for its utilization as a tea table or as the base for a bed. The table is, on the other hand, tied by one of its sides to the wall of the room in which it is in stalled, and is orientated in a direction parallel to the wall itself or orthogonally to the wall it self according to its type of employment. Such an ar rangement, however, limits the longitudinal dimen sion of the table since its tying point to the wall, when the table is vertically arranged, determines the maximum length of the table itself. Another drawback presented by the presently em ployed tables is that they must remain bound to the wall and they cannot be utilized in different ambi ents, for instance in the open. The object of the present invention is repre sented by improvements in the tables anchored to wall, which are mainly based upon the tying systems for the table to the wall and upon the application of orientatable legs, built and arranged in such a way that the legs themselves may be made to disap pear within or under the table and or orientated both in a vertical or in horizontal direction, and also able to be varied in their lengths. According to the improvements which are the ob ject of the present invention, each table is provi ded with at least three legs, two of them being ar ranged on a side and one leg at least on the opposed side, the legs being housed in embodied or not sheaths or guides, within the thickness of the table and en ding by hooking means for a pre arranged anchorage situated on a wall, each leg being formed as a sin gle body or being divided longitudinally into two por tions which are mutually slidable and fixable. The terminal portion of the leg towards the sheath is pro vided, directly or indirectly, with a slot or link block apted to receive a pin carried by a slider hou sed within the sheath, said pin being able to slide within the slot which permits, when the leg is disen gaged from the sheath to dispose angularly the leg it self and to displace the leg upwards, preventing a further undesired rotation of the leg. The anchorage means are formed by a terminal member with a corresponding hooking support fixed to the free end of each leg, and carryng at its free end two pins whose axles are distanced each other by a distance equal to the thickness of the hook ser ving to connect with the wall, hook which houses within its cavity one of the said pins, whereas the other pin, once the hooking has been effected, rests against the lower surface of the hook itself. The anchoring hook fixed to the wall is preferably sli dable on a guide so that it will permit the table to effect transversal movements with respect to the point at which the hook is fixed to the wall, a plu rality of hooks being couplable at a fixed distance on a single slide. These and other characteristics and advantages will appear more clear from the reading of the de tailed description of preferred embodiments which are listed in the following with reference to the exemplary enclosed drawings, in which With reference to said drawings and in particu lar to the Figures 1 to 6, let consider initially the table 1 with its legs 2, 3 which are retractable and orientatable. As one can see from the drawing, the table 1 is provided with three legs, of which two 2 are arranged on a side, preferably the si de of the anchorage to the wall, and one leg, the leg 3, on the opposed side. The legs 2 and 3, as it will be better explained in the following, are formed by telescopic elements provided with terminal members 4 with corresponding hooking supports apted to be anchored to the suspension hook Figures 20, 27 or to the connecting hooks to the wall Figures 21, 27, 28 . The feasibility of hooking, or not, the table to the wall and the presence of the legs 2 and 3, ma kes possible the utilization of the table 1 both tied to, or disengaged from, the wall, thus remarka bly increasing its versatility. On the other hand, the table 1 can be easily doubled since more tables can be juxtaposed each to the other or can also be hinged at 5 between each other. In this case, as shown schematically in the Figures 8 to 15, the various planes 1 are, in the rest con dition, folded each upon the the other, while the legs are made to disappear within their housings, as it will be more detailedly described in the follo wing. It has been said that the legs 2 and 3 are retrac table and orientatable. To this purpose, each leg 2, 3 Figures 16 to 19 and 23 to 26 is formed by two parts, i.e. an external container, sheath or guide, 6 and a proper leg 7. As shown in the Figures 17, 18, 24, 25, the leg 7 can be longitudinally divided into two parts, sli dable with respect to each other and fixable in the established position Figures 17 and 24 in such way to achieve the desired length, or can be formed of a single piece Figures 18 and 25 . Through the fir st solution, it is made feasible the objective of reducing the lenght of the external container, she ath or guide, 6, whereas through the second solution one achieves, apart from a fixed height of the table from the ground, a relative larger length of the ex ternal container 6. The true and proper leg 7 ends by a terminal portion with hooking support 4, at its end external to the sheath 6 see Figures 33 to 35 , whereas its opposed end is tied to a slider 9, which will descri bed in the following in a more detailed way. The leg 7 is, therefore, in condition to slide and be received within the sheath 6 which, as already said, may be housed within the thickness of the ta ble or be applied externally to it. The slider 9 has the double purpose of guiding and locking the leg 7 within the sheath 6, and of constituting an articulated joint so that the leg 7 will be in condition to be orientated on the same axis as the sheath 6 or orthogonally to it. To this end, the slider 9 is formed by two elements 9, 9 of which the portion 9 received within the sheath 6 ends with a pin 10, whereas the portion 9 , fixed to the leg 7 or integral with it, ends by a slot 11. Around the pin 10, furthermore, a block latch, sha ped as a small lever, may rotate, which prevents, if not operated, the mutual displacement of the two por tions 9, 9 . Supposing the leg 7 housed within the sheath 6, by exerting a traction upon the terminal 4, the leg is extracted from the sheath 6 until the end of the portion 9 of the slider will be a ble to rotate about the pin 10, permitting the ro tation of the leg 7 from the position in axis with the sheath to a position orthogonal to it. By the effect of the pin slot engagement, the pin, while the leg is in traction, rests upon the end of the slot which is looking towards the terminal of the leg, but, after the leg has been rotated, i.s. when the table 1 rests upon the leg itself, it will be in contact with the opposed end of the slot. Said slot has such length that, following said displacement, the upper end of the portion 9 will displace itself upwards in such a way that the side of said portion 9 will rest against the rim of the table 1, preven ting any undesired rotation of the leg. Furthermore, the external surfaces of the fork shaped portion of the element 9 carrying the pin 10 are truncated cone shaped, so that , when the leg 7 is in working position, they will be blocked with the correspondin gly shaped sides of the sleeve 12 . Only by having the pin 10 to slide again within the slot 11, it will be possible to vary again the angular position of the leg with respect to the ta ble. Suitably, the sheath 6 ends externally by a sleeve 12 which constitutes the abutment for the portion 9 of the sleeve, and in the same time cau ses the stopping in the direction of the extraction of the sleeve 9. It is to be pointed out that the extraction of the leg 7 from the sheath can be limi ted and this permits, for instance, to distance the table from the wall see Figures 2 and 8 . Natural ly, the maximum distancing corresponds to almost the entire length of the leg 7. It has been said that the leg, at the free end, ends with a hooking support 4, at whose terminal end, as it is better seen from the Figures 33 to 39, two pins 12 and 14 are foreseen, which are parallel to each other and have their axes suitably distanced. Between them the hook 15 is intended to be housed to which the table must be anchored or hooked, this hook being tied to the wall and, as it may be seen from the Figures 33, 35, 36, 37, 38 , remaining im prisoned between the upper pin 12 and the lower pin 13. The table 1, therefore, is unable to effect any oscillation in a vertical direction, but it can be disengaged from the hook 13 only by a rotation of it around the axis of the upper pin 12. The external side walls of the support of the pins 12, 13 are sha ped in such a way to tie themselves, when the leg 7 is housed within the table, within the sleev 12 , thus preventing its exiting. A suitable rotation of the whole about the axis of the pin 12 is needed in order to achieve the disengagement of the leg 7. The shape of the terminal 4 permits also to over hang vertically the table 1. Indeed, by hooking the pin 12, or 13, of the legs 2, or respectively 3, to the wall hooks 15, both lower and upper, as it can seen from the Figures 38 and 39, the table remains safely tied in a horizontal position, from which it can be removed only through a movement of rotation and raising which permits to hook the upper pin 12 or 13 of the hook 15. Naturally, the pins 12 of the legs 2 will look downwards or upwards according to the fact that the table is orientated upwards, or re spectively downwards. We have spoken about the wall hooks 15 inten ded to tie the table 1 to the wall both in a hori zontal or in a vertical position. Let now make reference to the Figures 20, 21, 27, 28, 38, 39, 40, 41 in order to illustrate more detailedly these hooks 15. Apart from the larger or lesser length of the true and proper hook, depending on the distance frm the application wall at which it must operate, the hook 15 may be hold by a fixed ba se 16 Fig.38 or preferably be a movable base Fig. 40 housed within a container 18 fixed to the wall. In such last case, the hook 15 may be made to slide within the container, and, therefore, also the posi tion of the table 1 along the wall may be varied, as shown by dash lines in the Figures 2,3 and 8, 9. As shown in the Figures 21 and 28, the support may be double, so that it will be in condition to receive the terminals, with hooking support 4, of both legs 2, thus permitting to tie the table 1 to the wall through a single hooking operation. As above exposed, given the presence, in each table, of three legs 2 and 3, and given the feasi bility to disengage from the wall the table 1, the lastnamed may be easily transported and employed in a place different from the place wherein it is us ually installed. In such a case, a resting base, anchorable snaplike to the terminals 4 of the legs 2, 3, and in particular of the leg 3, confers a bet ter stability to the table. On the other hand, the presence of the three legs permits to double the table 1 by hinging one wing to the other, as shown in the Figures 8 to 12 and in particular in the Figures 13, 14, 15, 30, 31, 32, wherein by dashed lines the presumable overall dimensions have been shown of the table, in the over hanging position, whereas by full lines the table in use position has been shown. The adoption of extensible legs 7 permits both the reduction of the length of the guide 6 and the feasibility of placing the table at such a height from the ground that a multiple use is allowed, as a resting plane for a possible mattress, as a tea table, and similar. The improvements in the tables anchored to a wall have been described and illustrated only by the way of a non limitative example. Obviously, one can ap ply to them, in the frame of the technical equival lences, the constructional variants which will be suggested to the specialists of the art in their re alization and which are within the scope of the ap pended Claims.
