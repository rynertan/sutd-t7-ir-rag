# Photogrammetric apparatus.

## Abstract
An apparatus for use photogrammetry and having two spaced apart parallel scanning zones 15 to which the pho tographs of a stereoscopic pair of photographs are mounted. An optical scanning system 35, 36, 37 or 35, 36, 71, 73, 75 which is mounted to a carriage 25 is provided for scan ning the two scanning zones 15 and for projecting images of the respective zones to a binocular viewing system 12 , and a secondary optical system 42, 44, 46, 46, 49, 50 or 63, 64, 65 or 83, 84, 73 is provided, preferably on the carriage 25 , for superimposing reference marks 41 or 62 or 82 on the pro jected images. The scanning system is arranged whereby simultaneous scanning of the two scanning zones 15 can be effected in a first y direction parallel to the scanning zones, and whereby independent scanning of the two scanning zones can be ef fected in a second x
