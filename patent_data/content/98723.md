# Automatic color control for a digital television receiver.

## Abstract
An automatic color control ACC for a digital television receiver is compatible with and is unaffected by variation of the phase of the color subcarrier signal C introduced in demodulat ing the color subcarrier to effect control of tint. ACC is per formed by a digital gain control 90 for scaling the digital words representing the sampled magnitudes of the color sub carrier burst signal. Quadrature demodulation 30, 32 of the color subcarrier produces color signal digital words I and C which are each sampled and latched 36, 42 during the color subcarrier burst. The sampled digital words are each squared 38, 44 and are then summed 46 together. The summed digital word is compared 48 to a chroma reference digital word and the difference digital word E is employed to scale 28 the color subcarrier digital words.
