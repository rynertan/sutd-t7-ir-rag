## Description
The present invention relates to methods forfabricating superconductive joints, particularly inmultifilamentary superconductive wires or cables. Evenmore particularly, the present invention relates to amold based method for superconductive joint fabricationwhich employs agitation of the wires in a solution forstripping the metal matrix surrounding themultifilamentary superconductive strands. A growing list of materials has now beenfound to exhibit superconductive properties when arecooled to temperatures below a critical value. Belowthis temperature all electrical resistance disappears.This permits the maintenance of current flow insuperconductive circuits without external energy orpower sources. In particular, superconductive conductorsdisposed in the form of electrical solenoids andcoils of various configurations are capable of substantiallycontinuous operation with no requirements to addadditional electrical energy to the circuit.Superconductive circuits employing such solenoids areparticularly advantageous in nuclear magnetic resonance NMR medical diagnostic imaging and spectroscopysystems. Moreover, superconductive circuits have foundutility in a number of applications including powerdistribution and in magnetically levitated vehicles. In any application in which superconductivewire is employed, it is almost variably necessary toemploy one or more superconductive joints . However,to ensure that the resulting closed loop or circuit is entirely superconductive, it is necessary to ensurethat the joint between the wire ends is alsosuperconductive. However, superconductive materialsdisplay a tendency to undergo sudden and unexpectedtransitions to the resistive or ohmic state from thesuperconductive state. This phenomenon is referred toas quenching. The reasons for this phenomenon are notthoroughly understood. However, it is strongly believedthat localized heating effects contribute to thephenomenon. However, the precise physical reasons forquenching do not yet appear to be fully understood.Accordingly, methods for its prevention are bestdescribable as empirical rather than theoretical. While quenching phenomena can occur in anyportion of a superconductive circuit, it nonethelessappears that superconductive joints are in fact particularlysusceptible to quench phenomena. Quenching isundesirable for at least three reasons. Firstly,quench conditions require restoration of the current inthe circuit. Secondly, quench conditions often resultin the undesired heating of the cryogenic fluid,typically liquid helium. Thirdly, quenching can causedamage to unprotected circuit elements. Accordingly,because of the undesired consequences of quenching andbecause of the particular susceptibility of superconductivejoints to quench phenomena, it is seen thatit is important to fabricate superconductive jointswhich are as immune as possible to this phenomenon. In the case in which superconductive wiresare to carry high levels of electrical current, forexample 1,000 amperes and above, it is common practiceto employ multifilamentary superconductive material.Typically such superconductive material comprises a carrier or matrix metal such as copper or copper nickelalloy or a similar matrix conductor in which filamentsof niobium titanium alloy are incorporated. In suchconductors an array of filaments are imbedded within abulk carrier matrix. The formation of superconductivejoints between multifilamentary wire ends poses particularlydifficult problems. For example, in one form ofsuperconductive joint the individual filaments aresoldered to a superconductive sheet individually. Thisis a highly labor intensive operation. While thisoperation produces workable superconductive joints, itis nonetheless desired to more easily produce jointshaving even greater reliability against quenching. A number of publications and patents dealwith niobium titanium superconductors and methods andmeans of forming joints between such superconductors. One such publication is an article appearingin the October 1977 issue of A method of forming a superconductive buttjoint between copper clad niobium titanium superconductorsby overwrapping the butt joint with smaller shuntsuperconductors and attaching the shunt in place bysolder including a lead bismuth solder is disclosed inUS A 3,453,378. Various prior art methodsof forming superconducting joints are disclosed in thispatent as well as problems arising from failure of suchjoints. The properties of various solders including solderscontaining lead and bismuth potentially useful in formingsuperconductive joints are disclosed in the article titled Superconductivity Measurements In Solders Commonly Usedfor Low Temperature Research appearing at page 180 of A superconductive connection involving use of solders isdescribed in US A 3,346,351 assigned to the same assigneeas the present application. A variety of superconductive solders and their uses aredescribed in US A 3,156,539 also assigned to the sameassignee as the subject application. Formation of a superconductive joint employing acombination of a superconductive low melting alloycontaining combinations of lead bismuth tin and an outercrimped sleeve are taught in US A 3,449,818. A method of making superconductive joints is also disclosedin US A 3,422,529 and is based upon the use of a crimpedsleeve or cylinder which may comprise either stainlesssteel or a superconductive alloy. This patent however doesnot describe the use of solders or the multifilamentarycondition and in particular requires twisting a pair ofsolid superconductive wires. Soldering multifilamentary Nb Accordingly, it is seen that many researchers have soughtmethods for forming reliable superconductive joints. It isalso seen that the methods found have been soughtempirically and that satisfactory explanations for thesuccess of certain methods have not been forthcoming. It is also an object of the present invention to provide amethod which is particularly suitable for joiningmultifilamentary superconductive cables. It is yet another object of the present invention to reducethe possibility of quenching in superconductive circuits. It is also an object of the present invention to provide amethod of superconductive joint fabrication which is notonly repeatable but is also amenable to automation. Lastly, but not limited hereto, it is an object of thepresent invention to provide reliable superconductivejoints and circuit elements. The invention provides a method of fabrication of superconductivejoints between multifilamentary superconductorwires embedded in a metal matrix as defined in claim 1and such a method where said wires are not embeddedin a metal matrix as defined in claim 2. Advantageousembodiments of said methods are subject matter of claims 3 to 24. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the presentinvention, as claimed, a method for forming superconductivejoints, particularly in multifilamentary superconductivewire, comprises a multistep process. First the ends of themultifilamentary superconductor wires to be joined aredisposed in a hot liquid metal stripping bath for removalof the metal matrix. It is a particular feature of oneembodiment of the present invention that these wire endsare moved or agitated relative to this stripping bath whiledisposed therein. The wire ends are then removed from thebath and inserted into a hot liquid superconductive solderbath. The wire ends are then removed from the solder bath,crimped if desired, and inserted into a mold. The mold,with wires in place, is then reinjected into the solder bath so as fill the mold. The solder is allowed to solidifyin the mold and the mold is removed from around the jointthereby forming a highly reliable superconductive joint. Inpractice, this process is preferably carried out in acontrolled atmosphere, such as argon under standardtemperature and pressure conditions. Accordingly, it isseen that the method of the present invention is capable ofproducing reliable superconductive joints andcorrespondingly reliable superconductive circuit elementssuch as coils, solenoids, windings and the like. The subject matter which is regarded as the invention isparticularly pointed out and distinctly claimed in theconcluding portion of the specification. The invention,however, both as to organization and method of practice,together with further objects and advantages thereof, maybest be understood by reference to the followingdescription taken in connection with the accompanyingdrawings in which In a preferred embodiment of the presentinvention a superconductive joint between multifilamentarysuperconductive cables or wires is formedas follows. It is first necessary to remove any metalmatrix surrounding the superconductive filaments fromthe end portions of the wires to be joined. This isaccomplished by disposing the ends of the wires in ahot liquid metal stripping bath for removal of themetal matrix. Typically, the metal matrix compriseseither copper or an alloy of copper and nickel. Asuitable stripping bath comprises a material such astin in which the copper or copper nickel alloy issoluble. The tin stripping bath is typically maintainedat a temperature of approximately 400 C. For asuperconductive wire in which a copper matrix surroundsfilaments of superconductive niobium titanium, it aspreferable to maintain the wires in such a strippingbath for approximately 45 minutes. In the case inwhich a copper nickel matrix surrounds niobium titaniumsuperconductive strands, it is preferable to maintainthe wire ends to be stripped in the tin bath for aperiod of approximately 180 minutes, again at a temperatureof approximately 400 C. It is also important forthe preferred embodiment of the present invention tomechanically agitate or move the wire ends relative tothe fluid in the stripping bath. This provides aflushing action which facilitates complete removal ofthe surrounding matrix material. One means for accomplishingthis flushing action is to rotate either thebath containing the wire ends or the mechanism holdingthe wire ends. For example, in a cylindrical bathhaving a diameter of approximately 15 cm 6 inches , it has been found to be useful to rotate the bath at a rate ofapproximately 4 rotations per minute. Additionally,the tin employed in the stripping bath should be ofhigh purity. For example, tin of five nines purityis desirable, that is tin having a purity of 99.99999 . Additionally, it is noted that it is preferableto carry out the various steps of the presentinvention in a controlled atmosphere. For example, theprocess may be carried out in a conventional laboratory glove box in which an inert atmosphere is present.An atmosphere comprising argon gas is preferred becauseof its inertness and relatively inexpensive cost.Xenon gas also could be employed, at atmosphericpressure as above, but the relatively higher cost ofxenon gas makes argon the gas of preference. It isalso noted that vacuum conditions also provide the kindof inert environment appropriate for carrying out thesteps of the present invention. However, because ofthe relative difficulty of maintaining vacuum conditionssuch conditions do not comprise a preferredembodiment of the present invention. However, vacuumconditions may be more appropriate for commercial scaleoperations employing automated joint fabrication. Itis also noted however that nitrogen does not in factconstitute a suitable atmosphere for the carrying outof the present invention. Additionally, it is preferredthat the atmosphere in the glove box containedless than approximately 10 parts per million of moisture. After an appropriate residence time in thestripping bath the wire ends to be joined are removedand disposed in a hot liquid superconductive solder,such as a mixture of lead and bismuth at a temperature of approximately 400 C. The lead bismuth solder whichis preferred in the present method comprises approximately40 lead and 60 bismuth by weight. However, amixture containing approximately 35 lead and 65 bismuth or solutions in between these ranges are alsoemployable. As in the tin stripping bath, high puritymaterials are desired. For example, it is preferredthat the lead in the solder be 99.9999 pure and thebismuth to be 99.99999 pure. Additionally, the leadin the solder bath is preferably pretreated by deoxidationin a graphite mold for a period of one hourat a temperature of approximately 450 C under vacuumconditions. In the case of niobium titanium superconductivefilaments disposed in a copper matrix aresidence time of approximately 15 minutes in alead bismuth solder bath is preferred. In the case ofniobium titanium superconductive filaments disposed ina copper nickel matrix it is desired to maintain thestripped ends of the wires to be joined in the superconductivesolder bath for a period of approximately 45minutes. After an appropriate residence time in thesolder bath the wire ends are removed, clustered orgrouped together if desired inserted into a mold, and the endsare thereafter reinserted into the solder bath.Suitable molds are shown in Figures 2 and 4 which aremore completely discussed below. After about 5 minutesin the solder bath the mold, now filled with solder, isremoved and placed in a chill stand for cooling. Oncethe solder has solidified, the mold is removed thusreleasing a solid reliable superconductive joint whichis typically between 2,5 and 5 cm one and two inches in length.Preferably, the mold comprises material to which the solder doesnot wet.Additionally, it is also possible to impart a twist to the wire filaments following their removal from thesuperconductive solder bath and prior to their insertioninto the mold. For superconductive conditions existing ataround 10 K it is also possible to employ tin as asuitable superconductive solder. Accordingly, in suchcircumstances the solder bath and the stripping bath.steps become merged. Figure 1 illustrates a prior art superconductivejoint structure in which superconductivecable 11 in the shape of a wire loop is provided withsuperconductive joint 12. Wire loop portion 11 illustratesthe condition of the wire prior to stripping ofthe copper matrix. The multifilamentary nature of thestripped cabling is evident in joint 12. For purposesof holding the wire ends together during joint formation,superconductive wire 13 is seen wrapped aroundthe wires to be joined immediately above the joint.The joint illustrated in Figure 1 is typical of the dip and twist structure described above. Figure 2 illustrates two mold halves employablein the process of the present invention.The mold comprises separate portions to facilitate removal of theresulting solidified superconductive joint. As shown in Fig.4the mold includes an elongate, substantially cylindrical cavityfor insertion of the wire ends. Moldhalves 20 and 21 also preferably include grooves 27 forinsertion of C clamps for holding the mold halvestogether. However, any other convenient clampingmechanism can be employed. Figure 2 also illustratesthat one of the mold halves 20 is fitted with handle 26for ease of manipulation particularly with respect toinsertion into the hot solder bath. Figure 3 illustrates superconductive joint 30fabricated in accordance with the present invention.In particular it is seen in this Figure that somesuperconductive wire already exists in the form of twisted niobium titanium strands. It is therefore alsoseen that the process of the present invention isapplicable to such conductors, and it is clear that forsuch conductors the matrix stripping operation isunnecessary and is accordingly by passed. Figure 4 illustrates an empty mold withC clips 28 holding halves 20 and 21 of the empty moldtogether in chill holder 15. Also illustrated isconvenience holder 16 holding loop 11 of superconductivecable the ends of which have been providedwith superconductive joint 30 which is seen beingremoved from mold halves 20 and 21. From the above, it should be appreciated thatthe method of superconductive joint manufacture of thepresent invention provides a rigid and reliable superconductivejoint which is significantly less prone toquench occurrences. It should also be appreciated thatthe method of the present invention is readilyautomatable, the use of the mold resulting in uniformand reliable superconductive joints whose manufacturedoes not depend upon the art or skill of manual assembly.Accordingly, the method of the present inventionproduces superconductive joints, solenoids, windingsand general superconductive circuits which exhibitimproved reliability and uniformity. While the invention has been described indetail herein in accordance with the preferred embodimentsthereof, many modifications and changes thereinmay be effected by those skilled in the art. Accordingly,it is intended by the appended claims to cover allsuch modifications and changes as fall within the truespirit and scope of the invention.
