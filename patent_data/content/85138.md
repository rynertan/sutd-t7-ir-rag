# A METHOD OF FORMING A MAGNETIC COATING ON A SUBSTRATE

## Abstract
This invention is directed to a method of forming a magnetic coating on a substrate. Ultrasonic energy is applied to a liquid coating formulation containing magnetic and nonmagnetic particles and intended for application to the substrate to form a magnetic recording layer. The ultrasonic energy breaks up agglomerations of the particles to give better particle dispersion in the coating formulation, thereby resulting in improved magnetic characteristics of the magne tic recording layer. The ultrasonic energy is applied to the coating formulation until it is ready to be applied to the substrate, to reduce any tendency of the particles to reagglomerate.
