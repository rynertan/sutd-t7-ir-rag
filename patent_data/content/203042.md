# Covering of synthetic material in the form of tiles and a method for its manufacture.

## Abstract
The covering has a layred structure with a core part 6 comprising two layer 8,9 of flexible, substantially inextensible synthetic material, between which is an inter mediate separating layer 10 . The covering is made in the form of tiles 1 , each of which has an upper face 2 and a lower face 3 and is delimited by tapered peripheral edges which define rounded upper edges 4 on the upper face. The covering is manufactured in the form of a continuous sheet or strip which is subjected to a hot dinking operation to form the tiles 1 .
