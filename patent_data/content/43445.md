# Process for oxidizing primary amines to oximes by elemental oxygen.

## Abstract
Primary saturated aliphatic and alicyclic amines are oxidized by elemented oxygen to oximes, especially cyclo hexylamine to cyclohexanone oxime, in vapor phase using silica gel catalyst preferably using concentrations by vol ume such as 1 to 5 of amine and 5 to 30 of oxygen, and using temperatures between about 120 C and 250 C at atmospheric pressure.
