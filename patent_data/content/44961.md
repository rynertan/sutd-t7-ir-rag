# Conductorless bubble domain switch.

## Abstract
A magnetic bubble domain system including a planar layer of magnetic material in which magnetic bubble do mains can be propagated and first and second bubble domain guide structure coupled to the layer and defining respective first and second bubble propagation paths for guiding the movement of bubbles in the layer in response to a cyclical change in the orientation of a reorienting mag netic field within the plane of the layer. A transfer bubble domain guide structure coupled to the layer is also provided for transferring bubble domains between the first and the second propagation paths re sponsive to a reverse in direction of the reorienting mag netic field. The transfer path is substantially the same as one of the directions of the crystallographic axes of the planar layer.
