# FLAVOR DELIVERY SYSTEM

## Abstract
A device for delivering flavor utilizing a flavor carrier in powdered form. A preferred embodiment of the system may re semble a conventional cigarette, and includes an overwrap de fining a path of airflow through the device, a chamber contain ing particulate matter, and a means for entraining the particu late matter in the airflow. The overwrap may be a tube, re sembling a conventional cigarette in appearance, feel, and draft. A means for entraining the particulate matter may be an intake flow limiter having a passage therein which causes a thin stream of high velocity air to impinge upon the particu late matter, entraining it in the airflow. Alternately, the entrain ing means may be a series of baffles or similar components which produce a turbulent airflow, thus entraining the particu late matter. Output means are also provided for eliminating stoppages and for delivering the airflow, with particulate mat ter entrained therein, to the user.
