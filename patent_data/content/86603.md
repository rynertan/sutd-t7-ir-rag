# Two wheeled vehicles.

## Abstract
A two wheeled vehicle comprises a body assembly 7 having its centre of gravity G‚ÇÅ offset to one side or the other of the fore and aft centre line N N of the vehicle. A steering assembly 5 is turnably connected with the body assembly 7 , and front and rear wheels 1, 6 are supported by the steering assembly and the body assembly, respectively. The front wheel or and the rear wheel is are offset with respect to the vehicle fore and aft centre line, in the case of the front wheel on the side opposite and in the case of the rear wheel on the same side as, the offset centre of gravity of the body assembly. The offsetting of one or and both wheel s in this way introduces a moment opposing the tilting effect of the body assembly offset centre of gravity and the vehicle is able to run in substantially upright position when running straight ahead.
