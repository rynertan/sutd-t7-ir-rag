# Method and apparatus for controlling supercharge pressure for a turbocharger.

## Abstract
A method and an apparatus for controlling supercharge pressure for a turbocharger in which a target value of super charge pressure is set up in accordance with the operating conditions of the engine and a basic control amount for a control valve for controlling the exhaust gas flow to an exhaust gas turbine is also set up in accordance with the operating conditions of the engine, and the basic control amount is corrected in response to the deviation between actual supercharge pressure and a target supercharge pressure value, when performing a feedback control of the supercharge pressure. With this construc tion, the actual supercharge pressure can accurately and stably be controlled to the target value required in accordance with the operating conditions of the engine.
