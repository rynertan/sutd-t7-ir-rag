# Sintered ceramic body and process for production thereof.

## Abstract
A process for producing a sintered ceramic body, which comprises heating a semi inorganic block copolymer at a temperature of from 500 to 2300 C in an environment of vacuum or inert gases, reducing gases or hydrocarbon gases, said copolymer comprising polycarbosilane blocks, having a main chain skeleton composed mainly of car bosilane units of the formula Si CH₂ and titanoxane units of the formula Ti O and shaping the heated product, and simultaneously with, or after, the shaping of the heated pro duct, sintering the shaped product at a temperature of from 800 C to 2300 C in an environment of vacuum or inert gases, reducing gases or hydrocarbon gases and a sintered ceramic body consisting substantially of Si, Ti and C and optionally of 0, said sintered body being composed substan tially of 1 an amorphous material consisting substantially of Si, Ti and C and optionally of 0, or 2 an aggregate consisting substantially of ultrafine crystalline particles of β SiC, TiC, a solid solution of β SiC and TiC and TiC
