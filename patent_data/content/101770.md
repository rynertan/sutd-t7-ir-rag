# Method for pumping slurry and apparatus for use therewith.

## Abstract
In the method of the present invention, the slurry as it flows from a source thereof is pre rotated prior to entering a circular vertical confined space that has a cut water dis charge in the upper portion thereof. The pre rotating slurry upon entering the confined space is subjected to the rotary action of first and second laterally spaced circular surfaces that have a number of laterally spaced ring shaped surfaces situated therebetween. The circular surfaces and ring shaped surfaces are power driven and rotate concurrently as a unit. As such rotation takes place, the boundary layers of slurry that adhere to the circular surfaces and ring shaped surfaces are sheared from the balance of the slurry, and the slurry in the confined space rotating as a result thereof. As a result of this rotation, the slurry in the confined space sequentially discharges through the cut water to be replaced by pre rotating slurry that enters the confined space. Tapered outer edge surfaces on the rotating surfaces direct slurry inwardly to the ring shaped surfaces to prevent a build up of solids in the confined space that would jam the rotation of the circular and ring shaped surfaces. The inner peripheries of the ring shaped surfaces define knife edges that sever particles in said slurry too large to move outwardly through the spaces between the ring shaped surfaces into portions that can pass through such spaces.

## Description
Field of the Invention Method for Pumping Slurry and Apparatus for UseTherewith. Description of the Prior Art The pumping of a slurry that has a liquid outer phase and an inner phase comprising particled material has present serious problems in the past, and particularly when a portion of the particles may be of a size of far greater magnitude than the major portions of the particles.Reciprocating pumps are unsatisfactory for moving such slurries as they are unable to handle large size particles without the risk of jamitiing. Also, reciprocating pumps have the operational disadvantage that they have a pulsating discharge that is undesirable in that it subjects hoses through which the slurry flows to intermittent high intensity stresses. A primary object of the present invention is to provide a method and a pump for carrying out the method whereby a slurry having a liquid. outer phase and particled inner phase may be transferred from one location to another location at a substantially constant rate and pressure without danger that the particled material will jam the operation of the pump. A further object of the invention is to furnish a method and pump in which a slurry containing highly abrasive particled material is transferred between locations with the abrasive particles doing a minimum amount of damage to the pump. A still further object of the invention is to provide a pump of such structure that as it operates the flow of slurry therethrough is so directed that it will not build up and jam the pump, and also the pump operating satisfactorily on slurries containing unusually large particles, with such particles being severed and disintegrated into smaller particles in the pump that can discharge therefrom due to the cutting action of rotating means in the pump that also provide the pumping action.SUMMERY OF THE INVENTION in the present invention a method is disclosed whereby a pump transfers a slurry having a liquid outer phase and particled inner phase from a first location to a second location at a substantially constant rate and pressure, and without danger of the particled material settling out and jamming the operation of the pump. In carrying out the method by use of the pump a first vertically extending circular confined space is defined. First and second laterally spaced circular surface defining members are disposed in the confined space, with a number of ringshaped discs being disposed therebetween. A powerdriven shaft extends through a centered sealed opening in the housing that defines the confined space. The shaft is secured to the second circular surface defining member.The ring shaped discs and the first circular surface defining member are secured to the first circular surface defining member by bolts, and the bolts having spacers thereon that maintain the ring shaped discs in laterally spaced relationship. The first and second circular surface defining members and the ring shaped discs rotate concurrently when the shaft is driven. Prior to the slurry flowing into the confined space means are provided to impart pre rotation thereto.The pre rotating slurry as it enters the confined space is subjected to the action of the rotating first and second surface defining members and ring shaped members that have boundary layers of the slurry adhering thereto, which boundary layers merge into the pre rotating slurry. The first and second surface defining members and ring shaped members are rotating at a substantially greater rate than that of the pre rotating slurry as it enters the confined space. As a result, the boundary layers are constantly sheared from the balance of the slurry in the confined space, and this shearing tending to rotate the slurry in the confined space at the same rate as the first and second surface defining members and ring shaped discs which is never achieved. The slurry in the confined space due to the shearing action rotates as a cylindrical body, with the slurry sequentially discharging through a cut water in the upper portion of the confined space, and the discharged slurry being replaced by pre rotating slurry that enters at substantially the center of the confined space. The slurry after it enters the confined space flows through an outwardly directed spiral path prior to discharging from the cut water. The individual particles in the inner phase will for the most part be of sufficiently small size as to moveoutwardly through the spaces between the ring shaped discs.When an entrained particle is in the slurry that is too large to pass through the spaces between the ring shaped discs, it will encounter the knife edges defined on the inner peripheries of the discs and be severed or disintegrated as a result thereof to subparticles that will pass through the spaces and be discharged with the slurry through the cut water. The first and second circular surface defining members have outer peripheral surfaces that taper inwardly towards one another, and serve to direct the outer portion of the rotating body of slurry in the confined space inwardly towards the ring shaped discs and thus prevent the pump becomming jammed due to particled material building up between the rotor and housing that defines the confined space.The interior of the housing is preferably hardened by nitriding, with layers of porous material thereafter applied thereto, and the voids in the proous material being filled with a material having a low coefficient of friction such asTeflon or the like. The low coefficient of friction minimizes the power required to rotate the body of slurry in the housing that defines the confined space. The side of the second surface defining member most adjacent the housing has a number of radially extending ridges defined thereon, which as the second member rotates tends to pump slurry outwardly in the confined space and away from the seal through which the shaft extends into the housing. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a side elevational view of the slurry pump FIG. 2 is a transverse cross sectional view of the pump taken on the line 2 2 of FIG.1 and FIG. 3 is a cross sectional view of the pump taken on the line 3 3 of FIG. 2. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED ErlsoDIb T The pump assembly A that may be used to carry out the method of the present invention includes a first housingB. The housing B is defined by a first side wall 10 and second side wall 12. Side walls 10 and 12 are laterally spaced and vertically disposed. An end wall 14 extends between side walls 10 and 12 and cooperates therewith to define a circular confined space 16. The first side wall 10 has a centered opening 18 therein that communicates with confined space 16. An opening 20 is formed in secon side wall 12, with the opening 20 serving as a support for a cylindrical first seal 22. A tubular shell 24 extends outwardly from second side wall and serves to support a second seal 26 in axial alignment with first seal 22. A longitudinal space 28 exists between the first and second seals 22 and 26. A bearing 30 is supported in shell 24 outwardly from second seal 26. A power driven shaft 32 is rotatably supported in bearing 30 and extends through the first and second seals 22 and 26 into the first confined space 16. The end wall 14 in the upper portion thereof in which a cut water discharge 34 is formed that communicates with an outwardly extending tubular diffuser 36. The internal expansion of the diffuser 36 does not exceed 7 degrees on a side thereof. A rotor assembly C is provided that includes first and second laterally spaced circular members 38 and 40, that may be formed from a heavy steel plate. A centered second opening 44 is formed in first circular member 38, which second opening is axially aligned with first openina 22. A number of parallel ring shaped discs 42 are disposed between first and second circular members 38 and 40. The discs 42 have spaces 43 defined therebetween.Discs 42 define a series of axially aligned third openings.The inner peripheries of the ring shaped discs 42 adjacent, the third openings 44 have opposite side surfaces 42a that taper inwardly towards one another to meet at an apex which is a circular knife edge 46. A number of heavy bolts 48 are provided that have heads 48a, shanks 48b and threads 48c on the end portions of the shanks. A number of circumferentially spaced transverse bores 50 are formed in the outer one third of the second circulaz member 40 through which the bolts 48 extend towards the first circular member 38. The bolts pass through openings 42a in the ring shaped discs 42. The threads 48c of the bolts engage tapped cavities 38c defined in the first circular member 38. The heads 48a are positioned in enlarged portions of the bores 50. Cylindrical spacers 52 are mounted on bolts 48, with the spacers and bolts cooperating to maintain the ringshaped discs 42 in a fixed relationship with first and second circular members 38 and 40, and also hold the ring shaped discs 42 in fixed lateral relationship to define spaces 53 therebetween. A second housing D is provided that defines a second circular confined space 54 into which slurry E flows through a conduit 56 that extends to a source of the slurry not shown . Housing D is secured to the exterior surface of first side wall 10 by conventional means 58, with an open end of second housing D in communication with first opening 16. The center 54a of second confined space 54 is disposed above the center of opening 16. Slurry E in flowing through second confined space 5 is pre rotated and when so rotating discharges intd the first circular confined space 16. Th e Xinetic energy of the pre rotating slurry E on entering the first circular confined space 16 is augmented by contact with the concurrently rotating first and second circular members 16 and 18 and the ring shaped discs 42.Both the circular members 16 and 18 and the ring shaped discs 42 have thin boundary layers of slurry E that adhere thereto and which boundary layers merge into the balance of the slurry E in confined space 16. The concurrently rotatino círcular members 16 and 18 and ring shaped discs 42 are moving at a rate greater than the pre rotating slurry E. As a result the boundary layers are constantly sheared from the balance of the slurry in the first circular confined space 16This shearing action imposes a rotary force on the slurry E in the first confined space 16. As the slurry E rotates in the first confined space 16 it is subjected to a centrifugal force, with slurry E after entering the confined space tending to travel outwardly in a spiral path.The kinetic energy imparted to the rotating body of slurry E in first confined space 16 will cause it to sequentially discharge through the cut water 34 into the diffuser where the kinetic energy is recovered. The first and second circular members have tapered outer edge surfaces 38a and 40a that extend towards one another, and preferably have an angle that is between 7 and 10 degrees.The tapered edge surfaces 38a and 40a serve to direct the rotating slurry inwardly towards the ring shaped discs 42.The edge surfaces 38z and 40a also tend to prevent the solid particled phase of the slurry E building up between the rotorC and housing B to the extent the rotor becomes jammed and cannot rotate. Second circular member 40 has an outwardly extending center portion 40b that serves to divert incoming slurry E outwardly in first confined space 16. The spaces 53 between the ring shaped discs. 42 are of sufficient width to permit the majority of the solid particles in the slurry E to move outwardly therethrough and then discharge through the cut water 34. Occassionally there will be solid particles E l in the slurry E that are of too great cross section to pass through spaces 53. These particlesE l are moved outwardly by centrifugal force to pressure contact the rotating knives 46 and be severed into particles and fragments that will pass outwardly through the spaces 53. The particled inner phase of the slurry E is normally of an abrasive nature. To minimize the slurry E having an abrasive action on the spacers 52 the bolts 48 are located on the outer one third of the second circular member 40 where the relative velocity between the slurry and spacers is low.This low velocity reduces the abrasive action on the spacers. To minimize friction between the rotating body of slurry E in first confined space 16 and the interior of the housing E, the interior surfaces of the first and second side walls 10 and 12 and end wall 14 are nitrided, with a layer of a hard porous material 62 then being applied to the nitrided surfaces. The voids in the porous material 62 are then filled with an anti friction material such asTeflon. The side 40a of the second circular member 40 most adjacent second side wall 12 has a number of shallow radially extending ridges 16 formed thereon, which ridges when the second member is rotating serve to pump the slurry E outwardly away from the first seat 22. This pumping action results in a longitudinal force being exerted on the rotor assembly C towards the first side wall 10. This force tends to balance the shaft 32 axially due to the imbalance created as a result of the incoming slurry E into the first confined space 16. The space 28 between the first and second seals 22 and 26 is connected to a small bore conduit that extends back to the slurry supply conduit 56. The structure of the pump assembly A and the method of suing the same has been described previously in detail and need not be repeated.
