## Description
SPECIFICATION TITLE OF THE INVENTION MAGNETIC MATERIALS AND PERMANENT MAGNETSFIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to improvements in the temperature dependency of the magnetic properties of magnetic materials and permanent magnets based on Fe B R systems. In the present disclosure, R denotes rare earth elements inclusive of yttrium.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Magnetic materials and permanent magnet materials are one of the important electric and eir ronic materials applied in an extensive range from various electrical appliances for domestic use to peripheral terminal devices of large scaled computers. In view of recent needs for miniaturization and high efficiency of electric and electronic equipments, there has been an increasing demand for upgrading of permanent magnet materials and generally magnetic materials. The permanent magnet materials developed yet include alnico, hard ferrite and samarium cobalt SmCo base materials which are well known and used in the art. Among these, alnico has a high residual magnetic flux density hereinafter referred to Br but a low coercive force hereinafter referred to Hc , whereas hard ferrite has high Hc but low Br. Advance in electronics has caused high integration and miniaturization of electric components. However, the magnetic circuits incorporated therein with alnico or hard ferrite increase inevitably in weight and volume, compared with other components. On the contrary, the SmCo base magnets meet a demand for miniaturization and high efficiency of electric circuits due to their high Br and Hc. However, samarium is rare natural resource, while cobalt should be included 50 60 wt therein, and is also distributed at limited areas so that its supply is unstable. Thus, it is desired to develop novel permanent magnet materials free fron these drawbacks. If it could be possible to use, as the main component for the rare earth elements use be made of light rare earth elements that occur abundantly in ores without employing much cobalt, the rare earth magnets could be used abundantly and with less expense in a wider range. In an effort made to obtain such permanent magnet materials, R Fe2 base compounds, wherein R is at least one of rare earth metals, have been investigated. A. E. Clark has discovered that sputtered amorphous TbFe2 has an energy product of 29.5 MGOe at 4.2 K, and shows a coercive force Hc 3.4 kOe and a maximum energy product BE max 7 MGOe at room temperature upon heat treated at 300 500 C. Reportedly, similar investigations on SmFe2 indicated that 9.2 MGOe was reached at 77 K.However, these materials are all obtained by sputtering in the form of thin films that cannot be generally used as magnets, e.g., speakers or motors. It has further been reported that melt quenched ribbons of PrFe base alloys show a coercive force He of as high as 2.8 kOe. In addition, Koon et al discovered that, with melt quenched amorphous ribbons of Fe0.82B0.18 0.9Tb0.05La0.05, Hc of 9 kOe was reached upon annealed at 6270 C Br 5kG . However, BH max is then low due to the unsatisfactory loop squareness of magnetization curves N. C. Koon et al, Appl. Phys. Lett. 39 10 , 1981, pp. 840 842 Moreover, L. Kabacoff et al reported that among melt quenched ribbons of Feo.8B0.2 1 xPrx x 0 0.03 atoic ratio , certain ones of the Fe Pr binary system show Hc on the kilo oersted order at room temperature. These melt quenched ribbons or sputtered thin films are not any practical permanent magnets bodies that can be used as such. It would be practically impossible to obtain practical permanent magnets from these ribbons or thin films. That is to say, no bulk permanent magnet bodies of any desired shape and size are obtainable from the conventionalFe B R base melt quenched ribbons or R Fe base sputtered thin films. Due to the unsatisfactory loop squareness or rectangularity of the demagnetization curves, the Fe B R base ribbons heretofore reported are not taken as the practical permanent magnet materials comparable with the conventional, ordinary magnets. Since both the sputtered thin films and the melt quenched ribbons are magnetically isotropic by nature, it is indeed almost impossible to obtain therefrom magnetically anisotropic hereinbelow referred to anisotropic permanent magnets for the practical purpose comparable to the conventinal hard ferrite or SmCo magnets.SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE An essential object of the present invention is to provide novel magnetic materials and permanent magnets based on the fundamental composition of Fe B R having an improved temperature dependency of tha magnetic properties. Another object of the present invention is to provide novel practical permanent magnets and magnetic materials which do not share any disadvantages of the prior art magnetic materials hereinabove mentioned. A further object of the present invention is to provide novel magnetic materials and permanent magnets having good temperature dependency and magnetic properties at room or elevated temperatures. A still further object of the present invention is to provide novel magnetic materials and permanent magnets which can be formed into any desired shape and practical size. A still further object of the present invention is to provide novel permanent magnets having magnetic anisotropy and excelling in both magnetic properties and mechanical strength. A still further object of the present invention is to provide novel magnetic materials and permanent magnets in which as R use can effectively be made of rare earth element occurring abundantly in nature. Other objects of the present invention will become apparent from the entire disclosure given herein. The magnetic materials and permanent magnets according to the present invention are essentially formed of alloys comprising novel intermetallic compounds, and are crystalline, said intermetallic compounds being characterized at least by new Curie points Tc. In the followings the term percent or denotes the atomic percent abridged as at if not otherwise specified. According to the first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a magnetic material comprising Fe, B, R at least one of the rare earth elements including Y and Co, and having its major phase formed of Fe Co B R type compound that is of the substantially tetragonal system crystal structure. According to the second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a sintered magnetic material having its major phase formed of a compound consisting essentially of, in atomic ratio, 8 to 30 of R wherein R represents at least one of the rare earth elements including Y , 2 to 28 of B, no more than 50 of Co except that the amount of Co is zero and the balance being Fe and impurities. According to the third aspect of the present invention, there is provided a sintered magnetic material having a composition similar to that of the aforesaid sintered magnetic material, wherein the major phase is formed of an Fe Co B R type compound that is of the substantially tetragonal system. According to the fourth aspect of the present invention, there is provided a sintered permanent magnet anFe Co B R base permanent magnet consisting essentially of, in atomic ratio, 8 to 30 of R at least one of the rare earth elements including Y , 2 to 28 of B, no more than 50 of Co except that the amount of Co is zero and the balance beingFe and impurities. This magnet is anisotropic. According to the fifth aspect of the present invention, there is provided a sintered anisotropic permanent magnet having a composition similar to that of the fourth permanent magnet, wherein the major phase is formed by an Fe Co B R type compound that is of the substantially tetragonal system crystal structure. Fe Co B R base magnetic materials according to the 6th to 8th aspects of the present invention are obtained by adding to the first third magnetic materials the following additional elements M, provided, however, that the additional elements M shall individually be added in amounts less than the values as specified below, and that, when two or more elements M are added, the total amount thereof shall be less than the upper limit of the element that is the largest, among the elements actually added For instance, Ti, V and Nb are added, the sum of these must be no more than 12.5 8 in all. 4.5 Ti, 8.0 Ni, 5.0 Bi, 9.5 V, 12.5 Nb, 10.5 Ta, 8.5 Cr, 9.5 Mo, 9.5 W, 8.0 Mn, 9.5 Al, 2.5 Sb, 7.0 Ge, 3.5 Sn, 5.5 Zr, and 5.5 Hf. Fe B R Co base permanent magnets according to the 9th to and 10th aspects of the present invention are obtained by adding respectively to the 4th and 5th permanent magnets the aforesaid additional elements M on the same condition. Due to the inclusion of Co, the invented magnetic materials and permanent magnets have a Curie point higher than that of the Fe B R type system or the Fe B R M type system. With the permanent magnets of the present invention, practically useful magnetic properties are obtained if the mean crystal grain size of the intermetallic compound is in a range of about 1 to about 100 Sm for both the Fe Co B R and Fe Co B R M systems. Furthermore, the inventive permanent magnets can exhibit good magnetic properties by containing 1 vol. t or higher of nonmagnetic intermetallic compound phases. The inventive magnetic materials are advantageous in that they can be obtained in the form of at least as cast alloys, or powdery or granular alloys or sintered bodies in any desired shapes, and applied to magnetic recording media such as magnetic recording tapes as well as magnetic paints, magnetostrictive materials, thermosensitive materials and the like. Besides, the magnetic materials are useful as the intermediaries for the production of permanent magnets. The magnetic materials and permanent magnets according to the present invention are superior in. mechanical strength and machinability to the prior art alnico, R Co type magnets, ferrite, etc., and has high resistance against chipping off on machining.

The Fe B R base permanent magnets contain Fe as the main component and light rare earth elements as R, primarily Nd and Pr, which occur abundantly in nature, and contain no Co. Nonetheless, they are excellent in that they can show an energy product reaching as high as 25 35MGOe or higher.The Fe B R base permanent magnets possess high characteristics at costs lower than required in the case with the conventional alnico and rare earth cobalt alloys.That is to say, they offer higher cost performance and, hence, greater advantages as they stand. As disclosed in the above Application, the Fe B R base permanent magnets have a Curie point of generally about 3000 C and at most 3700C. The entire disclosure of said Application is herewith incorporated herein with reference thereto with respect to the Fe B R type magnets and magnetic materials.Such a Curie point is considerably low, compared with theCurie points amounting to about 800 C of the prior art alnico or R Co base permanent magnets. Thus, the Fe B R base permanent magnets have their magnetic properties more dependent upon temperature, as compared with the alnico orR Co base magnets, and are prone to deteriorate magnetically when used at elevated temperatures. As mentioned above, the present invention has for its principal object to improve the temperature dependency of the magnetic properties of the Fe B R base magnets and generally magnetic materials. According to the present invention, this object is achieved by substituting part of Fe, a main component of the Fe B R base magnets, with Co so as to increase the Curie point of the resulting alloy. The results of researches have revealed that the Fe B R base magnets are suitably used in a usual range of not higher than 700 C, since the magnetic properties deteriorate at temperature higher than about 1000 C. As a result of various experiments and studies, it has thus been found that the substitution of Co for Fe is effective for improving the resistance to the temperature dependency of the Fe B R base permanent magnets and magnetic materials. More specifically, the present invention provides permanent magnets comprised of anisotropic sintered bodies consisting essentially of, in atomic percent, 8 to 30 R representing at least one of the ware earth elements including yttrium , 2 to 28 of B and the balance being Fe and inevitable impurities, in which part of Fe is substituted withCo to incorporate 50 at or less of Co in the alloy compositions, whereby the temperature dependency of said permanent magnets are substantially increased to an extent comparable to those of the prior art alnico and R Co base alloys. According to the present invention, the presence of Co does not only improve the temperature dependency of the Fe B R base permanent magnets, but also offer additional advantages.That is to say, it is possible to attain high magnetic properties through the use of light rare. earth elements such as Nd and Pr which occur abundantly in nature. Thus, the present Co substituted Fe B R base magnets are superior to the existing R Co base magnets from the standpoints of both natural resource and cost as well as magnetic properties. It has further been revealed from extensive experiments that the resistance to the temperature dependency and the magnetic properties best suited for permanent magnets are attained in the case where part of Fe is replaced by Co, the crystal structure is substantially of the tetragonal system, and the mean crystal grain size of the sintered body having a substantially tetragonal system crystal structure is in a certain range. Thus, the present invention makes it possible to ensure industrial production of high performance sintered permanent magnets based on the Fe Co B R system in a stable manner. By measurements, it has been found that the Fe Co B R base alloys have a high crystal magnetic anisotropy constantKu and an anisotropic magnetic field Ha standing comparison with that of the existing Sm Co base magnets. According to the theory of the single domain particles, magnetic substances having high anisotropy field Ha potentially provide fine particle type magnets with high performance as is the case with the hard ferrite or SmCo base magnets. From such a viewpoint, sintered, fine particle type magnets were prepared with wide ranges of composition and varied crystal grain size after sintering to determine the permanent magnet properties thereof. As a consequence, it has been found that the obtained magnet properties correlate closely with the mean crystal grain size after sintering. In general, the single magnetic domain, fine particle type magnets magnetic walls which are formed within each particles, if the particles are large. For this reason, inversion of magnetization easily takes place due to shifting of the magnetic walls, resulting in a low Hc. On the contrary, if the particles are reduced in size to below a certain value, no magnetic walls are formed within the particles. For this reason, the inversion of magnetization proceeds only by rotation, resulting in high Hc.The critical size defining the single magnetic domain varies depending upon diverse materials, and has been thought to be about 0.01 pm for irony about 1 pm for hard ferrite, and about 4 Fm forSmCo. The Hc of various materials increases around their critical size. In the Fe Co B R base permanent magnets of the present invention, Hc of 1 kOe or higher is obtained when the mean crystal grain size ranges from 1 to 100 Hm, while Hc of 4 kOe or higher is obtained in a range of 1.5 to 50 Sm. The permanent magnets according to the present invention are obtained as sintered bodies. Thus, the crystal grain size of the sintered body after sintering is of the primary concern. It has experimentally been ascertained that, in order to allow the Hc of the sintered compact to exceed 1 kOe, the mean crystal grain size should be no less than about 1 pm after sintering. In order to obtain sintered bodies having a smaller crystal grain size than this, still finer powders should be prepared prior to sintering.However, it is then believed that the Hc of the sintered bodies decrease considerably, since the fine powders of the Fe Co B R alloys are susceptible to oxidation, the influence of distortion applied upon the fine particles increases, superparamagnetic substances rather than ferromagnetic substances are obtained when the grain size is excessively reduced, or the like. When the crystal grain size exceeds 100 pm, the obtained particles are not single magnetic domain particles, and include magnetic walls therein, so that the inversion of magnetization easily takes place, thus leading to a drop in Hc. A grain size of no more than 100 p r. is required to obtain Hc of no less than 1 kOe. Particular preference is given to a range of 1.5 to 50 pm, within which Hc of 4 kOe or higher is attained. It should be noted that the Fe Co B R M base alloys to be discussed later also exhibit the magnetic properties useful for permanent magnets, when the mean crystal grain size is between about 1 and about 100 pm, preferably 1.5 and 50 Fm. It is generally observed that, as the amount of Co incorporated in Fe alloys increases, some Fe alloys increase in Curie point Tc , while another decrease in that point.For this reason, the substitution of Fe with Co generally causes complicated results which are almost unexpectable. As an example, reference is made to the substitution of Fe inRFe3 compounds with Co. As the amount of Co increases, Tc first increases and peakes substantially at a point where a half of Fe is replaced by Co, say, R Fe0.5C00.5 3 is obtained, and thereafter decreases. In the case of Fe2B alloys, Tc decreases with certain gradient by the substitution of Fe with Co. According to the present invention, it has been noted that, as illustrated in Fig. 1, Tc increases with increases in the amount of Co, when Fe of the Fe B R system is substituted with Co. Parallel tendencies have been observed in all theFe B R type alloys regardless of the type of R. Even a slight amount of Co is effective for the increase in Tc and, as will be seen from a 77 x Fe xCo 8B 15Nd alloy shown by way of example in Fig. 1, it is possible to obtain alloys having any desired Tc between about 310 and about 7500C by regulation of x. In the Co substituted Fe B R base permanent magnets according to the present invention, the total composition ofB, R and Fe plus Co is essentially identical with that of the Fe B R base alloys without Co . Boron B shall be used on the one hand in an amount no less than 2 so as to meet a coercive force of 1 kOe or higher and, on the other hand, in an amount of not higher than 28 so as to exceed the residual magnetic flux density Br of about 4 kG of hard ferrite. R shall be used on the one hand in an amount no less than 8 so as to obtain a coercive force of 1 kOe or higher and, on the other hand, in an amount of 30 or less since it is easy to burn, incurs difficulties in handling and preparation, and is expensive The present invention offers an advantage in that less expensive light rare earth element occurring abundantly in nature can be used as R since Sm is not necessarily requisite nor necessarily requisite as a main component. The rare earth elements used in the magnetic materials and the permanent magnets according to the present invention include light and heavy rare earth elements inclusive of Y, and may be applied alone or in combination. Namely, R includes Nd, Pr, La, Ce, Tb, Dy, Ho, wr, Eu, Sm, Gd, Pm, Tm, Yb, Lu and Y. Preferably, the light rare earth elements amount to no less than 50 at 8 of the overall rare earth elements R, and particular preference is given to Nd and Pr.More preferably Nd plus Pr amounts to no less than 50 at of the overall R. Usually, the use of one rare earth element will suffice, but, practically, mixtures of two or more rare earth elements such as mischmetal, didymium, etc. may be used due to their ease in avilability. Sm, Y, La, Ce, Gd and the like may be used in combination with other rare earth elements such as Nd, Pr, etc. These rare earth elements R are not always pure rare earth elements and, hence, may contain impurities which are inevitably entrained in the production process, as long as they are technically available. Boron represented by B may be pure boron or ferroboron, and those containing as impurities Al, Si, C etc. may be used. Having a composition of 8 30 at R, 2 28 at B, 50 at or less Co, and the balance Fe with the substantially tetragonal system crystal structure after sintering and a mean crystal grain size of 1 100 Sm, the permanent magnets according to the present invention have magnetic properties such as coercive force Hc of 2 1 kOe, and residual magnetic flux density Br of 4 kG, and provide a maximum energy product BH max value which is at least equivalent or superior to the hard ferrite on the order of up to 4 MGOe . Due to the presence of Co in an amount of 5 or more the thermal coefficient of Br is about 0.1 C or less.If R ranges from 12 to 24 , and B from 3 to 27 , BH max about 7 MGOe is obtainable so far as R and B concern. When the light rare earth elements are mainly used as R those those elements amount to 50 at or higher of the overall R and a composition is applied of 12 24 at P, 4 24 at z B, 5 45 at t Co, with the balance being Fe, maximum energy product BH max of 1 10 MGOe and said thermal coefficierit of Br as above are attained. These ranges are more preferable, and BH max reaches 33 MGOe or higher. Referring to the Fe 5Co B R system for instance, the ranges surrounded with contour lines of BE max 10, 20, 30 and 33 MGOe in Fig. 12 define the respective energy products. TheFe 20Co B R system can provide substantially the same results. Compared with the Fe B R ternary magnets, theCo containing Fe B R base magnets of the present invention have better resistance against the temperature dependency, substantially equivalent Br, equivalent or slightly less iHc, and equivalent or higher BH max since the loop squareness or rectangularity is improved due to the presence of Co. Since Co has a corrosion resistance higher than Fe, it is possible to afford corrosion resistance to the Fe B R base magnets by incorporation of Co. Particularly Oxidation resistance will simplify the handling the powdery materials and for the final powdery products. As stated in the foregoing, the present invention provides embodiments of magnetic materials and permanent magnets which comprise 8 to 30 at R R representing at least one of rare earth element including yttrium , 2 to 28 at B, 50 at or less Co except that the amount of Co is zero , and the balance being Fe and impurities which are inevitably entrained in the process of production referred to Fe Co B R type . The present invention provides further embodiments which contain one or more additional elements M selected from the group given below in the amounts of no more than the values specified below wherein when two or more elements of M are contained, the sum of M is no more than the maximum value among the values specified below of said elements M actually added and the amount of M is more than zero 4.5 Ti, 8.0 Ni, 5.0 Bi, 9.5 V, 12.5 Nb, 10.5 z Ta, 8.5 Cr, 9.5 Mo, 9.5 W, 8.0 Mn, 9.5 Al, 2.5 Sb, 7.0 Ge, 3.5 Sn, 5.5 Zr, and 5.5 Hf. The incorporation of the additional elements M enhances Hc resulting in an improved loop squareness. The allowable limits of typical impurities contained in the final or finished products of magnetic materials or magnets are up to 3.5, preferably 2.3, at for Cu up to 2.5, preferably 1.5, at for S up to 4.0, preferably 3.0, at for C up to 3.5, preferably 2.0, at for P and at most 1 at for O oxygen , with the proviso that the total amount thereof is up to 4.0, preferably 3.0, at . Above the upper limits, no energy product of 4 MGOe is obtained, so that such magnets as contemplated in the present invention are not obtained see Fig. 11 .With respect to Ca, Mg and Si, they are allowed to exist each in an amount up to about 8 at , preferably with the proviso that their total amount shall not exceed about 8 at t. It is noted that, although Si has effect upon increases in Curie point, its amount is preferably about 8 at or less, since iHc decreases sharply in an amount exceeding 5 at t. In some cases, Ca and Mg may abundantly be contained in R raw materials such as commercially available Neodynium or the like. Iron as a starting material for instance includes following impurities by wt not exceeding the values below 0.03 C, 0.6 Si, 0.6 Mn, 0.5 P, 0.02 S, 0.07 Cr, 0.05 Ni, 0.06Cu, 0.05 Al, 0.05 O2 and 0.003 N2.Electrolytic iron generally with impurities as above mentioned of 0.005 wt or less is available. Impurities included in starting ferroboron 19 13 B alloys are not exceeding the values below, by wt 0.1 C, 2.0 Si, 10.0 Al, etc. Starting neodymium material includes impurities, e.g., other rare earth element such as La, Ce, Pr and Sm Ca, Mg,Ti, Al, O, C or the like and further Fe, C1, F or Mn depending upon the refining process. The permanent magnets according to the present invention are prepared by a so called powder metallurgical process, i.e., sintering, and can be formed into any desired shape and size, as already mentioned. However, desired practical permanent magnets bodies were not obtained by such a melt quenching process as applied in the preparation of amorphous thin film alloys, resulting in no practical coercive force at all. On the other hand, no desired magnetic properties particularly coercive force were again obtained at all by melting, casting and aging used in the production of alnico magnets, etc.. The reason is presumed to be that crystals having a coarser grain size and a ununiform composition are obtained. Other various techniques have been attempted, but none have given any results as contemplated. In accordance with the present invention, however, practical permanent magnets bodies of any desired shape are obtained by forming and sintering powder alloys, which magnets have the end good magnetic properties and mechanical strength.For instance, the powder alloys are obtainable by melting, casting and grinding or pulverization. The sintered bodies can be used in the as sintered state as useful permanent magnets, and onay of course be subjected to aging as is the case in the conventional magnets. The foregoing discussions also hold for both theFe Co B R system and the Fe Co B R M system.PREPARATION OF MAGNETIC MATERIALS Typically, the magnetic materials of the present invention may be prepared by the process forming the previous stage of the overall process for the preparation of the permanent magnets of the present invention. For example, various elemental metals are melted and cast into alloys having a tetragonal system crystal structure, which are then finely ground into fine powders. As the magnetic material use may be made of the powdery rare earth oxide R203 a raw material for R . This may be heated with powdery Fe, powdery Co, powdery FeB and a reducing agent Ca, etc for direct reduction. The resultant powder alloys show a tetragonal system as well. The powder alloys can further be sintered into magnetic materials. This is true for both the Fe Co B R base and theFe Co B R M base magnetic materials. The Fe Co B R base magnets of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the examples, which are given for the purpose of illustration alone, and are not intended to limit the invention. Fig. 1 typically illustrates changes in Curie point Tc of 77Fe 8B 15Nd wherein part of Fe is substituted with Co x , and 77 x Fe xCo 8B 15Nd wherein x varies from 0 to 77. The samples were prepared in the following steps. 1 Alloys were melted by high frequency melting and cast in a water cooled copper mold. As the starting materials forFe, B and R use was made of, by weight ratio for the purity, 99.9 z electrolytic iron, ferroboron alloys of 19.38 B, 5.32 Al, 0.74 Si, 0.03 C and the balance Fe, and a rare earth element or elements having a purity of 99.7 or higher with the impurities being mainly other rare earth elements, respectively. As Co, electrolytic Co having a purity of 99.9 was used. 2 Pulverization The castings were coarsely ground in a stamp mill until they pass through a 35 mesh sieve, and then finely pulverized in a ball mill for 3 hours to 3 10 Fm. 3 The resultant powders were oriented in a magnetic field of 10 kOe and compacted under a pressureof 1.5 t cm2. 4 The resultant compacts were sintered at 1000 1200 OC for about one hour in an argon atmosphere and, thereafter, allowed to cool. Blocks weighing about 0.1 g were obtained from the sintered bodies by cutting, and measured on their Curie points using a vibrating sample magnetometer in the following manner.A magnetic field of 10 kOe was applied to the samples, and changes in 4tI depending upon temperature were determined in a temperature range of from 250 C to 800 C. A temperature at which 4tI reduced virtually to zero was taken as Curie pointTc. In the above mentioned systems, Tc increased rapidly with the increase in the amount of Co replaced for Fe, and exceeded 6000C in Co amounts of no less than 30 t. In the permanent magnets, increases in Tc are generally considered to be the most important factor for reducing the changes in the magnetic properties depending upon temperature.To ascertain this point, a number of permanent magnet samples as tabulated in Table 1 were prepared according to the procedures as applied for the preparation of those used in Tc measurements to determine the temperature dependency of Br. 5 The changes in Br depending upon temperature were measured in the following manner. Magnetization curves are obtained at 25 C, 60 C and 100 C, respectively, using a BH tracer, and the changes in Br at between 25 and 600C and between 60 and 100 C were averaged. Table 1 shows the thermal coefficient of Br and the measurement results of magnetization curves at 25 C, which were obtained of various Fe B R andFe Co B R base magnets. From Table 1, it is evident that the changes in Br depending upon temperature are reduced by incorporation of Co into the Fe B R base magnets. Namely, thermal coefficients of about 0.1 CC or less are obtained if Co is 5 or more. Table 1 also shows the magnetic properties of the respective samples at room temperature. In most of the compositions, iHc generally decreases due to the Co substitution, but BS max increases due to the improved loop rectangularity of the magnetization curves.However, iHc decreases if the amount of Co increases from 25 to 50 finally reaching about the order of 1.5 kOe.Therefore the amount of Co shall be no higher than 50 so as to obtain iHc 1 kOe suitable for permanent magnets. From Table 1 and Fig. 1 the relationship between the Co amount and the magnetic properties is apparent. Namely, even a small amount of Co is correspondingly effective for the improvement of Tc. In a range of 25 or less Co, other magnetic properties particularly, the energy product are substantially not affected. See, samples 2, and 8 12 ofTable 1 . If Co exceeds 25 , BH max also decreases. The reasons already given in connection with the upper and lower limits of B and the lower limit of R will be confirmed from Table 1, Fig. 2 and Fig. 3.

The initial magnetizaton curve 1 rises steeply in a low magnetic field, and reaches saturation. The demagnetization curve 2 shows very high loop rectangularity, which indicates that the magnet is a typical high performance anisotropic magnet. From the form of the initial magnetization curve 1, it is thought that this magnet is a so called nucleation type permanent magnet since the SmCo type magnets of the nucleation type shows an analogous curve, wherein the coercive force of which is determined by nucleation occurring in the inverted magnetic domain. The high loop rectangularity of the demagnetization curve 2 indicates that this mgnet is a typical high performance anisotropic magnet. Other samples according to the present invention set forth in Table 1 all showed magnetization curves similar to that of Fig. 4. A number of magnets using primarily as R light rare earth element such as Nd, Pr, etc., are shown in Table 1, from which it is noted that they possess high magnetic properties, and have their temperature dependency further improved by the substitution of Fe with Co. It is also noted that the use of a mixture of two or more rare earth element as R is also useful. Permanent magnet samples of Fe Co B R M alloys containing as M one or two additional elements were prepared in a manner similar to that applied for the preparation of theFe Co B R base magnets. The additional elements M used were Ti, Mo, Bi, Mn, Sb,Ni, Sn, Ge and Ta each having a purity of 99 , by weight so far as the purity concerns as hereinbelow, W having a purity of 98 , Al having a purity of 99.9 , and Hf having a purity of 95 t. As V ferrovanadium containing 81.2 of V as Nb ferroniobium containing 67.6 of Nb as Cr ferrochromium containing 61.9 of Cr and as Zr ferrozirconium containing 75.5 of Zr were used, respectively. A close examination of the samples having a variety of compositions was carried out by the determination of iHc, Br, BH max, etc. As a result, it has been found that, in quintinary or multicomponent systems based on Fe Co B R M wherein M represents one or two or more additional elements , there is a certain region in which high permanent magnet properties are developed. Table 2 shows the maximum energy product BH max, which is the most important factor of the permanent magnet properties, of typical samples. In Table 2, Fe is the balance. From Table 2, it has been appreciated that theFe Co B R M base magnets have high energy product of 10 NGOe or greater over a wide compositional range. This table mainly enumerates the examples of alloys containing Nd and Pr, but any of 15 rare earth element Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu give rise to increase in BH max. However, the alloys containing Nd andPr according to the present invention are more favorable than those containing as the main materials other rarer rare earth element Sm, Y and heavy rare element , partly because Nd andPr occur relatively abundantly in rare earth ores, and especially because no applications of Nd in larger amounts have been found Also in the Fe Co B R M alloys, Co has no noticeable influence upon BH max, when it is added in an amount of 25 or less and Co contributes to the increase in the Curie points with the increasing Co amount as is the case for the Fe Co B R alloys.For instance, comparisons of Sample Nos. 48 with 50, 58 with 60, and 68 with 70 reveal that a compositional difference in the amount of Co 1 to 10 Co between these alloys causes no noticeable difference in BH max. Fig. 5 shows the relationship between the Curie point and the amount of Co by at t of the Fe Co B R M alloys wherein M is V, Nb, Zr and Cr, and indicates that the Curie point increases with increases in the amount of Co, but the addition of M gives rise to substantially no remarkable change in the Curie point. Parallel tendencies have been observed in theFe Co B R M fundamental alloys regardless of the type of R.Even a slight amount of Co, e.g., 1 is effective for Tc increases, and it is possible to obtain alloys having any desired Tc between about 3100C and about 7500C by varying of x, as will be evident from the 76 x Fe xCo 8B 15Nd lM system exemplified in Fig. 5. Accordingly, it has turned out that with respect to theFe Co B R M system the relationships between the Co amount and the magnetic properties, and between the ranges of B and R and the magnetic properties are established analogously to theFe Co B R system previously discussed, provided that the effect of the additional elements M acts additionally. The Fe Co B R M magnets according to the present invention have Curie points higher than the Fe B R M magnets without Co. In the Fe Co B R M magnets, most of M have an effect upon increases in Bc. Fig. 6 shows the demagnetization curves of the typical examples of the Fe Co B R M magnets and M freeFe Co B R magnets given for the purpose of comparison. In this figure, reference numerals 1 to 3 denote the demagnetization curves of a M free magnet, a Nb containing magnet Table 1 No.3 and a W containing magnet Table 1 No.83 , respectively. An increase in Hc due to the addition of M provides an increased stability and wide applicability of the permanent magnets. However, the greater the amount of M, the lower theBr and BH max will be, due to the fact that they are nonmagnetic materials except Ni . Since permanent magnets having slightly reduced BH max but high Hc have recently been often required in certain fields, the addition of M is very useful, however, provided that BH max is at least 4 MGOe. To ascertain the effect of M upon Br, Br was measured in varied amounts of N. The results are summarized in Figs. 7 to 9. As. seen from Figs. 7 to 9, the upper limits of the additional elements M Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Ta, Nb, Cr, W, No, Sb,Sn, Ge and Al other than Bi, Ni, and Mn may be chosen such that Br is at least equivalent to about 4 kG of hard ferrite.A preferable range in view of Br should be appreciated fromFigs. 7 to 9 by defining the Br range into 6.5 kG, 8kG, 10 kG or the like stages. Based on these figures, the upper limits of the amounts of additional elements M are fixed at the following values at or below which BH max is at least equivalent or superior to about 4 MGOe of hard ferrite 4.5 Ti, 8.0 Ni, 5.0 Bi, 9.5 8 V, 12.5 Nb, 10.5 Ta, 8.5 Cr, 9.5 o, 9.5 W, 8.0 Mn, 9.5 Al, 2.5 Sb, 7.0 Ge, 3.5 Sn, 5.5 8 Zr, and 5.5 Hf. When two or more elements M are employed, the resulting characteristic curve will be depicted between the characteristic curves of the individual elements in Fig. 7 to 9. Thus each amount of the individual elements N are within each aforesaid range, and the total amount thereof is no more than the maximum values among the values specified for the individual elements which are actually added and present in a system. For instance, if Ti, V and Nb are added the total amount of these must be mo more than 12.5 in all. A more preferable range for the amount of M is determined from a range of BH max within which it exceeds 10MGOe of the highest grade alnico. In order that BH max is no less than 10 MGOe, Br of 6.5 kG or higher is required. From Figs. 7 to 9, the upper limits of the amounts of M are preferably defined at the following values 4.0 Ti, 6.5 Ni, 5.0 Bi, 8.0 V, 10.5 Nb, 9.5 Ta, 6.5 Cr, 7.5 Mo, 7.5 W, 6.0 Mn, 7.5 Al, 1.5 Sb, 5.5 Ge, 2.5 Sn, 4.5 Zr, and 4.5 z Hf wherein two or more additional elements M are used, the preferable ranges for M are obtained when the individual elements are no higher than the aforesaid upper limits, and the total amount thereof is, no higher than the maximum values among the values allowed for the individual pertinent elements which are actually added and present. Within the upper limits of N, when the Fe Co B R base system preferably comprises 4 to 24 of B, 11 to 24 of R light rare earth elements, primarily Nd and Pr , and the balance being the given amounts of Fe and Co, BH max of 10MGOe or higher is obtained within the preferable ranges of the additional elements M, and reaches or exceeds the BH max level of hard ferrite within the upper limit of M. Even when the Fe Co B R base system departs from the above mentioned preferable range, BH max exceeding that of hard ferrite is obtained, if the additional element N are ln the above mentioned preferable range. According to more preferable embodiments of the present invention, the permanent magnets have BH max of 15, 20, 25, 30 and even 33 MGOe or higher. In general, the more the amount of M, the lower the Br however, most elements of FI serve to increase iHc. Thus, BH max assumes a value practically similar to that obtained with the case where no M is applied, through the addition of an appropriate amount of M, and may reach at most 33 MGOe or higher. The increase in coercive force serves to stabilize the magnetic properties, so that permanent magnets are obtained which are practically very stable and have a high energy product. If large amounts of Mn and Ni are incorporated, iHc will decrease there is only slilght decrease in Br due to the fact that Ni is a ferromagnetic element see Fig. 8 . Therefore, the upper limit of Ni is 8 , preferably 6.5 , in view of Hc. The effect of Mn upon decrease in Br is not strong but larger than is the case with Ni. Thus, the upper limit of Mn is 8 , preferably 6 , in view of iHc. With respect to Bi, its upper limit shall be 5 , since any alloys having a Bi content exceeding 5 cannot practically be produced due to extremely high vapor pressure.

grain size and the magnetic properties of the Fe Co B R base magnets will be described in detail hereinbelow. The pulverization procedure as previously mentioned was carried out for varied periods of time selected in such a manner that the measured mean particle sizes of the powder ranged from 0.5 to 100 y m. In this manner, various samples having the compositions as specified in Table 3 were obtained. Comparative Examples To obtain a crystal grain size of 100 om or greater, the sintered bodies were maintained for prolonged time in an argon atmosphere at a temperature lower than the sintered temperature by 5 20 C. From the thus prepared samples having the compositions as specified in Table 3 were obtained magnets which were studied to determine their magnetic properties and their mean crystal grain sizes. The results are set forth in Table 3.The mean crystal grain size referred to herein was measured in the following manner The samples were polished and corroded on their surfaces, and photographed through an optical microscope at a magnification ranging from xlOO to x1000. Circles having known areas were drawn on the photographs, and divided by lines into eight equal sections. The number of grains present on the diameters were counted and averaged. However, grains on the borders circumferences were counted as half grains this method is known as Heyn s method . Pores were omitted from calculation. In Table 3, the samples marked represent comparative examples. From the sample Nos. 7 and 8, it is found that Hc drops to less 1 kOe if the crystal grain size departs from the scope as defined in the present invention. Samples designated as Nos. 13 and 16 in Table 3 were studied in detail in respect of the relationship between their mean crystal grain size D and Hc. The results are illustrated in Fig. 10, from which it is found that Hc peaks when D is approximately in a range of 3 10 Wm, decrease steeply when D is below that range, and drops moderately when D is above that range. Even when the composition varies within the scope as defined in the present invention, the relationship between the mean crystal grain size D and Hc is substantially maintained. This indicates that the Fe Co B R system magnets are the single domain particle type magnets. From the results given in Table 3 and Fig. 10, it is evident that, in order for the Fe Co B R base magnets to possess Br of about 4 kG of hard ferrite or more and Hc of no less than 1 kOe, the composition comes within the range as defined in the present invention and the mean crystal grain size D is 1 100 Em, and that, in order to obtain Hc of no less than 4 kOe, the mean crystal grain size should be in a range of 1.5 50 Fm. Control of the crystal grain size of the sintered compact can be carried out by controlling process conditions such as pulverization, sintering, post heat treatment, etc. Table 3EMI42.1 magnetic SEP properties tb SEP mean SEP crystal SEP thermal tb BH max tb SEP grain SEP size SEP coefficient SEP iHc kOe SEP Br kG tb No. SEP compositions SEP at SEP SEP MGOe tb D SEP m SEP of SEP Br SEP C tb SEP 1 SEP Fe 2B 15Nd SEP 6.0 SEP 0.14 SEP 1.0 SEP 9.6 SEP 4.0 tb SEP 2 SEP Fe 8B 15Nd SEP 5.5 SEP 0.14 SEP 9.5 SEP 12.3 SEP 33.2 tb SEP 3 SEP Fe 32B 15Nd SEP 10.1 SEP 0.16 SEP 11.0 SEP 2.5 SEP 1.3 tb SEP 4 SEP Fe 17B 30Nd SEP 7.3 SEP 0.16 SEP 14.8 SEP 4.5 SEP 4.2 tb SEP 5 SEP Fe 10Co 15B 5Pr SEP 22.0 SEP SEP 0 SEP 0 SEP 0 tb SEP 6 SEP Fe 60Co lOB 13Nd SEP 15.7 SEP 0.07 SEP 0.6 SEP 7.9 SEP 2.8 tb SEP 7 SEP Fe 20Co 12B 14Pr SEP 110 SEP 0.09 SEP 1 SEP 5.7 SEP 1.8 tb SEP 8 SEP Fe 40Co 17B 15Nd SEP 0.85 SEP 0.07 SEP 1 SEP 6.1 SEP 1.4 tb SEP 9 SEP Fe 20Co 12B 14Pr SEP 8.8 SEP 0.09 SEP 6.8 SEP 10.4 SEP 19.5 tb SEP 10 SEP Fe 40Co 17B 15Nd SEP 2.8 SEP 0.06 SEP 6.5 SEP 9.2 SEP 17.1 tb SEP li SEP Fe 50Co 8B 15Nd SEP 4.7 SEP 0.06 SEP 1.5 SEP 8.7 SEP 5.5 tb SEP 12 SEP Fe 5Co 8B l5Nd SEP 29.0 SEP 0.11 SEP 6.4 SEP 11.3 SEP 25.2 tb SEP 13 SEP Fe 30Co 17B 15Nd SEP 36.5 SEP 0.08 SEP 5.2 SEP 8.6 SEP 13.6 tb SEP 14 SEP Fe 15Co 16B 16Pr SEP 68.0 SEP 0.09 SEP 3.6 SEP 10.2 SEP 9.4 tb SEP 15 SEP Fe 20Co 7B 15Nd SEP 5.6 SEP 0.09 SEP 8.6 SEP 12.1 SEP 31.9 tb SEP 16 SEP Fe 5Co 7B 15Nd SEP 6.5 SEP 0.11 SEP 9.0 SEP 12.5 SEP 34.2 tb SEP 17 SEP Fe 20Co llB 8Nd 7Pr SEP 17.5 SEP 0.09 SEP 6.3 SEP 9.5 SEP 14.7 tb SEP Fe 10Co 11B 7Nd tb SEP 18 SEP 22.3 SEP 0.10 SEP 4.8 SEP 7.7 SEP 9.8 tb 3Pr 5La tb 19 SEP Fe 30Co 17B 22Nd SEP 13.5 SEP 0.08 SEP 4.4 SEP 5.4 SEP 4.8 tb SEP 20 SEP Fe 10Co 10B 5Ho 10Nd SEP 19.0 SEP 0.10 SEP 6.6 SEP 8.9 SEP 15.7 tb 21 SEP Fe 10Co 10B 13Nd 2Dy 1La SEP 15.5 SEP 0.10 SEP 6.8 SEP 10.0 SEP 22.3 tb SEP 22 SEP Fe 20Co 9B 10Nd 6Pr 1Sm SEP 10.3 SEP 0.10 SEP 5.7 SEP 10.4 SEP 21.5 tb SEP 23 SEP Fe 15Co 7B 14Nd 2Gd SEP 7.5 SEP 0.10 SEP 4.7 SEP 9.7 SEP 16.7 tb The embodiments and effects of the M containingFe Co B R base magnets Fe Co B R M magnets will now be explained with reference to the following examples given for the purpose of illustration alone and intended not to limit the invention Tables 4 1 to 4 3 show properties of the permanent magnets comprising a variety of Fe Co B R M compounds, which were prepared by melting and pulverization of alloys, followed by forming of the resulting powders in a magnetic field then sintering.

Prefix refers to comparative tests Fig. 11 shows the demagnetization curves of the typical examples of the invented Fe Co B R M base magnets and the N free Fe Co B R base magnets. In this figure, reference numerals 1 3 denote the demagnetization curves of a M free magnet, a Mo containing magnet Table 4 1 No. 20 and aNb containing magnet Table 4 1 No. 16 , all of which show the loop squareness useful for permanent magnet materials. The curve 4 represents ones with a mean crystal grain size D of 52 Am for the same composition as 3. In Table 5 comparative samples with marks are shown, wherein 1 3 are samples departing from the scope of the present invention. From 4 and 5, it is found that He drops to 1 kOe or less if the mean crystal grain size departs from the scope of the present invention. Samples designated as Nos. 21 and 41 in Tables 4 2 and 4 3 samples were studied in detail in respect of the relationship between their mean crystal grain size D and Hc.The results are illustrated in Fig. 11, from which it is found that Hc peaks when D is approximately in a range of 3 10 jim, decreases steeply when D is below that range, and drops moderately when D is above that range. Even when the composition varies within the scope as defined in the present invention, the relationship between the average crystal grain size D and Hc is substantially maintained. This indicates that the Fe Co B R M base magnets are the single domain particle type magnets. Apart from the foregoing samples, an alloy having the same composition as Sample No. 20 of Table 4 1 was prepared by the casting procedure 1 as already stated. However, the thus cast alloy had Sc of less than 1 kOe in spite of its mean crystal grain size being in a range of 20 80 Fm. From the results given in Table 4 1 and Fig. 10, it is evident that, in order for the Fe Co B R M base magnets to possess Br of about 4 kG of hard ferrite or mpre and lic of no less than 1 kOe, the composition comes within the range as defined in the present invention and the mean crystal grain size is about 1 about 100 ssm, and that, in order to obtainBe of no less than 4 kOe, the mean crystal grain size should be in a range of about 1.5 about 50 flm. Control of the crystal grain size of the sintered compact can be controlled as is the case of the Fe Co B R system. As mentioned in the foregoing, the invented permanent magnets of the Fe Co B R M base magnetically anisotropic sintered bodies may contain, in addition to Fe, Co, B, R and M, impurities which are entrained therein in the process of production as is the case for the Fe Co B R system.CRYSTAL STRUCTURE It is believed that the magnetic materials and permanent magnets based on the Fe Co B R base alloys according to the present invention can satisfactorily exhibit their own magnetic properties due to the fact that the major phase is formed by the substantially tetragonal crystals of the Fe B R type. As already discussed, the Fe Co B R type alloy is a novel alloy in view of its Curie point. As will be discussed hereinafter, it has further been experimentally ascertained that the presence of the substantially tetragonal crystals of the Fe Co B R type contributes to the exhibition of magnetic properties. The Fe Co B R type tetragonal system alloy is unknown in the art, and serves to provide a vital guiding principle for the production of magnetic materials and permanent magnets having high magnetic properties as aimed at in the present invention. According to the present invention, the desired magnetic properties can be obtained, if the Fe Co B R crystals are of the substantially tetragonal system. In most of theFe Co B R base compounds, the angles between the axes a, b and c are 90 within the limits of measurement error, and aO bo o cO . Thus, these compounds can be referred to as the tetragonal system crystals. The term substantially tetragonaln encompasses ones that have a slightly deflected angle between a, b and c axes, e.g., within about 1 , or ones that have ao slightly different from lo, e.g., within about 1 . To obtain the useful magnetic properties in the present invention, the magnetic materials and permanent magnets of the present invention are required to contain as the major phase an intermetallic compound of the substantially tetragonal system crystal structure. By the term major phase , it is intended to indicate a phase amounting to 50 vol or more of the crystal structure, among phases constituting the crystal structure. The Fe Co B R base permanent magnets having various compositions and prepared by the manner as hereinbelow set forth as well as other various manners were examined with anX ray diffractometer, X ray microanalyser XMA and optical microscopy. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES 1 Starting Materials Purity is given by weight Fe electrolytic iron 99.9 B ferroboron, or B having a purity of 99 R 99.7 or higher with impurities being mainly other rare earth elements Co electrolytic cobalt having purity of 99.9 2 The experimental procedures are shown in Fig. 15. The experimental results obtained are illustrated as below 1 Fig. 14 illustrates a typical X ray diffraction pattern of the Fe Co B Nd Fe lOCo 8B l5Nd in at sintered body showing high properties as measured with a powder X ray diffractometer. This pattern is very complicated, and can not be explained by any R Fe, Fe B or R B type compounds developed yet in the art. 2 XMA measurement of the sintered body of 1 hereinabove under test has indicated that it comprises three or four phases. The major phase simultaneously contains Fe,Co, B and R, the second phase is a R concentrated phase having a R content of 70 weight or higher, and the third phase is an Fe concentrated phase having an Fe content of 80 weight or higher. The fourth phase is a phase of oxides. 3 As a result of analysis of the pattern given inFig. 14, the sharp peaks included in this pattern may all be explained as the tetragonal crystals of QO 8.80 and cO 12.23A . In Fig. 14, indices are given at the respective X ray peaks. The major phase simultaneously containing Fe, Co, B and R, as confirmed in the XMA measurement, has turned out to exhibit such a structure. This structure is characterized by its extremely large lattice constants. No tetragonal system compounds having such large lattice constants are found in any one of the binary system compounds such as R Fe, Fe B and B R. t4 Fe Co B R base permanent magnets having various compositions and prepared by the aforesaid manner as well as other various manners were examined with an X ray diffractometer, XMA and optical microscopy. As a result, the following matters have turned out i Where a tetragonal system compound having macro unit cells occurs, which contains as the essential componentsR, Fe, co and B and has lattice constants ao of about 9 A andGo of about 12 A, good properties suitable for permanent magnets are obtained. Table 6 shows the lattice constants of tetragonal system compounds which constitute the major phase of typical Fe Co B R type magnets, i.e., occupy 50 vol or more of the crystal structure. In the compounds based on the conventional binary system compounds such as R Fe, Fe B and B R, it is thought that no tetragonal system compounds having such macro unit cells as mentioned above occur. It is thus presumed that no good permanent magnet properties are achieved by those known compounds.

With the permanent magnet materials, the fine particles having a high anisotropy constant are ideally separated individually from one another by nonmagnetic phases, since a high Bc is then obtained. To this end, the presence of 1 vol or higher of nonmagnetic phases contributes to the high Bc. In order that Be is no less than 1 kOe, the nonmagnetic phases should be present in a volume ratio between 1 and 45 vol , preferably between 2 and 10 vol . The presence of 45 or higher of the nonmagnetic phases is unpreferable. The nonmagnetic phases are mainly comprised lof intermetallic compound phases containing much of R, while oxide phases serve partly effectively. iii The aforesaid Fe Co B R type tetragonal system compounds occur in a wide compositional range. Alloys containing, in addition to the Fe Co B R base components, one or more additional elements M and or impurities entrained in the process of production can also exhibit good permanent magnet properties, as long as the major phases are comprised of tetragonal system compounds. As apparent from Table 6 the compounds added with M based on the Fe B R system exhibit the tetragonal system as well as the Fe Co B R M system compounds also does the same. Detaileo disclosure regarding other additional elements M as disclosedinthe European Patent application No.83106573.5 filed on July 5, 1983 is herewith referred to and herein incorporated. The aforesaid fundamental tetragonal system compounds are stable and provide good permanent magnets, even when they contain up to 1 of H, Li, Na, K, Be, Sr, Ba, Ag, Zn, N, F,Se, Te, Pb, or the like. As mentioned above, the Fe Co B R type tetragonal system compounds are new ones which have been entirely unknown in the art. It is thus new fact that high properties suitable for permanent magnets are obtained by forming the major phases with these new compounds. In the field of R Fe alloys, it has been reported to prepare ribbon magnets by melt quenching. However, the invented magnets are different from the ribbon magnets in the following several points. That is to say, the ribbon magnets can exhibit permanent magnet properties in a transition stage from the amorphous or metastable crystal phase to the stable crystal state. Reportedly, the ribbon magnets can exhibit high coercive force only if the amorphous state still remains, or otherwise metastable Fe3B and R6 Fe23 are present as the major phases. The invented magnets have no sign of any alloy phase remaining in the amorphous state, and the major phases thereof are not Fe3B and R6Fe23. The present invention will now be further explained with reference to the following example. EXAMPLE An alloy of 10 at Co, 8 at B, 15 at Nd and the balance Fe was pulverized to prepare powders having an average particle size of 1.1 ym. The powders were compacted under a pressure of 2 t cm2 and in a magnetic field of 12 kOe, and the resultant compact was sintered at 10800 C for 1 hour in argon of 1.5 Torr. X ray diffraction has indicated that the major phase of the sintered body is a tetragonal system compound with lattice a constants QO 8.79A and c0 12.21A. As a consequence of XtS and optical microscopy, it has been found that the major phase contains simultaneously Fe, Co, B and Pr, which amount to 90 volume thereof. Nonmagnetic compound phases having a R content of no less than 80 assumed 4.5 in the overall with the remainder being substantially oxides and pores. The mean crystal grain size was 3.1 pm. The magnetic properties measured are Br 12.0 kG, iHc 9.2 kOe, and BH max 34MGOe, and are by far higher than those of the conventional amorphous ribbon magnet. By measurement, the typical sample of the present invention has also been found to have high mechanical strengths such as bending strength of 25 kg mm2, compression strength of 75 kg mm2 and tensile strength of 8 kg mm2.This sample could effectively be machined, since chipping hardly took place in machining testing. As is understood from the foregoing, the present invention makes it possible to prepare magnetic materials and sintered anisotropic permanent magnets having high remanence, high coercive force and high energy product with the use of less expensive alloys containing light rare earth elements, a relatively small amount of Co and based on Fe, and thus present a technical breakthrough.
