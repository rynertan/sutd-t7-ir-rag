## Description
DESCRIPTION ETHYLENE OXYCHIOPLIl 7 A TION CATALYST The combination of cupric chloride and potassium chloride deposited on a support material is flown to be effective in catalyzing the vapor phase oxychlorination of ethylene to produce ethylene dichloride. In this oxychlorination process, a gaseous mixture of ethylene, oxygen and a chlorine source, typically hydrogen chloride, is contacted with a fixed or fluidized bed of catalyst at moderately elevated temperature.The gaseous reaction stream containing ethylene dichloride and water vapor is condensed to form organic and aqueous liquid phases, the organic phase containing crude ethylene chloride being lforked up in known fashion to produce purified ethylene dichloride product with the aqueous phase being discharged to waste. Although conducting the ethylene oxychlonnation reaction in the presence of a supported cupric chloride potassium chloride catalyst results in satisfactorily high yields of ethylene dichloride, it has often been observed that the reaction is accomPanied by an undesirably high rate of ethylene burning, i.e. an unduly high proportion of ethylene feedstock is burned to carbon dioxide rather than being converted to ethylene chloride product. It is believed that ethylene burning is attributable to a copper rich catalyst resulting from uneven distribution of cupric and potassium chlorides on the support material. In accordance with this invention, it has been found that, in the production of ethylene dichloride by vapour phase oxychlorination of ethylene in the presence of a catalyst comprisir.g cupric chloride and potassium chloride carried on a particulate support material, the level. of ethylene burning is rcduced when substantially all f the cupric chloride and potassium chloride deposited on the support material are deposited in the form of the trichlorocuprate complex, ECCuC13 The catalyst, for use according to this invention, may be prepared by mixing or slurring support material with an aqueous solution that is substantially equimolar in cupric chloride and potassium chloride followed by drying or evaporation of water, the temperature during both mixing or slurrying and drying or evaporation being maintained above 760C, In the ternary system ZCl CuCl2 H20, two chlorocuprates are present, i.e. E2CuC14 2H20 and KCuC13 2H20 Since in the aqueous solution used to treat the support material, cupric and potassium chlorides are present in substantially equimolar quantities, and since it is desired to deposit substantially all of the potassium and cupric chlorides on the support material in the form of the trichlorocuprate complex, KCuC13, it is necessary that the temperature during deposition and drying be maintained above 76 C., for the KCuCl3 complex cannot be deposited in substantially pure form at temperatures below 76 C. but will be contaminated with greater or lesser amounts of the tetrachlorocuprate complex, E2CuC14, and cupric chloride.Thus, in the preparation of catalyst for use in this invention, a uniform distribution of copper and potassium relative to each other can be assured by maintaining temperature above 760C. at all times during impregnation of the support material with the aqueous treating solution and subsequent drying of the impreganted support material. As to choice of support material, the same may be any commonly used catalyst carrier, e.g., silica, silica gel, alumina, diatomaceous earth, and the like.If the catalyst is to be used in a fluidized rather than a fixed bed, silica or high silica e.g. containi.nW 40 to 55 percent SiG2 and from 2 to 30 percent, typically 10 to 20 percent A1203 or alkali metal silj cate content clay minerals are preferred, some examples of which are bentonite, kaolinite, illite and attapulgite clay minerals.Alumina or high alumina e., containing in excess of 40 percent and typically in excess of 75 percent Al 0 content 23 clay minerals, e.g. diaspore and bauxite clays, may be used however, these have been found to be somewhat more friable and to have a higher attrition rate when used in a fluidized bed than the predominantly silica or alkali metal silicate containing clays. Of the clay minerals, attapulgite is particularly preferred. The quantity of trichlorocuprate complex KCuC13 deposited on the support material may vary over a wide range provided, of course, that substantially all of the cupric and potassium chlorides are present as the trichlorocuprate complex. Typically, sufficient trichlorocuprate complex is deposited on the support material so as to provide a copper content of from about 4 to 12 weight percent and preferably from about 7 to 9 weight percent based on the combined weight of trichlorocuprate complex and support material. It is to be understood that the copper and potas sium content of the catalyst is that resulting from depositing cupric and potassium chlorides on the support material and does not include copper and potassium that may be inherently present in the support material. It is to be further understood that the catalyst may also contain other knojn additives, such as for example, aluminium chloride as described in our U.S. Patent No.4 172 052 in which case such other additives may be deposited on the support material prior to deposition of the trichlorocuprate complex in accordance with this invention. In a typical practice of the invention, ethylene, hydrogen chloride and oxyger. gases are fed, in.knom fashion, to a fixed or fluid bed reactor and, in the latter case, at a rate sufficient to maintain the catalyst bed in a fluidized condition without significant entrainment of catalyst particles in the product gas stream. The ratio of reactant gases, reaction temperature and contact time of reactant gases with the catalyst may vary but typically a mole ratio of ethylene hydrogen chloride oxygen of 1.0 1.5 0.5, a temperature of 150 to 5000C., usually 250 to 3500C., and a contact time of 10 seconds to about two minutes are usually employed.Particle size of the catalyst may also vary, and in the case of fluid bed operation, particle size of the catalyst is typically in the range of 30 to 200 mesh U.S. Sieve , preferably between 40 and 100 mesh. Depending on reaction conditions, conversion of unburned ethylene to ethylene dichloride usually ranges from at least 70 percent to substantially quantitative and an ethylene dichloride crude having an ethylene dichloride content of from 97 to 99 percent or more may be obtained.Of course, the vapor phase oxychlorination of ethylene to ethylene chloride nay be conducted using a fixed rather than fluidized bed of catalyst in knolem manner and under knows process conditions. This invention may be further illustrated as follows A A quantity of an aqueous solution equimolar in potassium chloride and cupric chloride is mixed with attapulgitc clay, sufficient of said solution being used so as to deposit on the clay, 8.0 0.5 weight percent copper and 5.0 0.5 weight percent potassium in the finished catalyst, the temperature during mixing and subsequent evaporation of water being maintained above 760C. The catalyst, so prepared, is charged to an oxychlorination reactor wherein a gaseous stream of ethylene hydrogen chloride oxygen in a molar ratio of 1 1.5 0.45 respectively are introduced at a rate sufficient to maintain the catalyst in a fluidized state, the reaction temperature being maintained at from about 280 0C to about 3000C, the contact time between the gaseous stream and catalyst being about 10 seconds. The extent of ethylene burning is observed to range from about 0.4 to about 0.7 percent basis ethylene in the feed gas. 2 A quantity of aqueous solution equimolar in potassium chloride and cupric chloride is mixed with attapulgite clay sufficient of said solution being used so as to deposit from 8.0 0.5 weight percent copper and 5.0 0.5 weight percent potassium on the finished catalyst the temperature during mixing maintained at about 50 or and the mixture being dried at a temperature of 1050cm A quantity of this catalyst in amount corresponding to that prepared in 1 supra is charged to an oxychlorination reactor and a gaseous mixture of ethylene, hydrogen chloride and oxygen in the molar proportion, rate and at the reaction temperature specified in 1 supra is contacted with the catalyst. The extent of ethylene burning is observed to be about 2.4 percent basis ethylene in the feed gas.
