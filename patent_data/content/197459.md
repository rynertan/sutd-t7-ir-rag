In the drawings Figure 1, diaphragm valve 10 is fixedly mounted in entrance port 12 of cylinder 14 partially shown . Valve 10 has outer tube member 16 composed of lower tube segment 18 and upper tube segment 20. Outer tube member 16 can have any shaped cross section, but a circular cross section is preferred. Lower edge 22 of upper tube segment 20 is a flat, outwardly extending rim. Upper edge 24 of lower tube segment 18 is an inwardly facing, outwardly extending U shaped portion. The rim of diaphragm 26 fits in and tightly against the U shaped upper edge 24. Lower rim 22 fits on top of the edge portion of diaphragm 26 and in U shaped upper edge 24. U shaped upper edge 24 has been crimped so as to tightly hold diaphragm 26 and upper tube segment 20 in place and to seal the rim of diaphragm 26 in reaction to the interior portion chamber 28 of lower tube segment 18. Most of the lower portion of valve stem 32 is positioned inside chamber 34 of upper tube portion 20. About the upper half of the inside wall surface of upper tube portion 20 is internally threaded 36. Cup 38 is positioned in chamber 34 with its open end facing upward and its flat bottom 40 in contact with the top surface of diaphragm 26. Valve stem 32 has main stem 42, handle 44 connected to the top of main stem 42 and external ly threaded sleeve 46 mounted around the middle portion of main stem 42. Externally threaded sleeve 46 is threadingly engaged with internally threaded portion 36 of upper tube portion 20. Main stem 42 and handle 44 contain vertical passageway 48, which has a circular cross section. Cylindrical shaft 50 slidably fits within passageway 48. Cylindrical ring 52 is affixedly mounted on the lower end of cylindrical shaft 50 which extends below the end of main shaft 42. The bottom side of cylindrical ring 52 is flat and contacts the inside surface of bottom 40 of cup 38. Shaft 50 and ring 52 are preferably constructed as one piece. Diaphragm 26 is held taut enough and has strength not to be appreciably depressed by the weight of cup 38, center shaft 50 and ring 52. Upper edge 78 is inwardly crimped to prevent removal of valve stem 32 from chamber 34. Spud 54 is an elongated member having longitudinal central bore 56. Spud 54 is externally threaded 58 in its middle portion. Both end rims 60, 62 of spud 54 are outwardly slanted. Bevelled rim 60 of spud 54 is mounted in circular port 64 located in the upper wall region of lower tube segment 18. Port 62 is slightly smaller in diameter than circular bevelled rim 60. Projection weld 66 holds spud 54 in place and helps seal the interface of bevelled rim 60 and the outer edge of port 64. External threads 58 allow a source of compressed gas not shown to be attached to spud 54 in order to deliver compressed gas to cylinder 14. Inner tube member 68 is positioned within chamber 28 of lower tube segment 18. Upper edge 70 of inner tube member 68 is outwardly flaired out and over to form a rounded valve seat for diaphragm 26. Inner tube member 68 has inner passageway 72. The lower end of inner tube member extends through port 12 of cylinder and forms lip 74. Lip 74 is an outwardly extending essentially flat portion which mates with the inside surface of slightly inwardly curved top portion of cylinder 14. Lower lip 30 of lower tube segment 18 is an outwardly extending essentially flat portion which mates with the outside surface of the slightly curved top portion of cylinder 14. Double projection weld 76 is used to fixedly attach lower lip 30 and lower lip 30 to cylinder 14 in a sealed manner. Internal rim 80 with internal passageway 82 is located on the outside surface of inner tube member 68 slightly below edge 70. Also, edge 70 of inner tube member 68 is located close to, but does not contact, the bottom surface of diaphragm 26 when diaphragm 26 is in its normal or open position . Coil spring 84 is posi tioned in the upper end of inner tube 68, resting on rim 80 and contacting diaphragm 26. Flexible diaphragm 26 is mounted above valve seat 70 and must be forced downward out of its normal horizontal orientation against the valve seat by turning valve stem 42 so as to rotate downwardly in order to effect closure. Diaphragm valve 10 does not require spring 84 to maintain dia phragm 26 in the open position, except in some instances when a vacuum has been pulled on the interior of gas cylinder 14. The diaphragm valve of the invention has a broad scope of usage, but is specifically intended for use on cylinders for shipment of compressed gases. The design and construction of diaphragm valve 10 provides improved features at substantial reduced costs. In the full open position, the operation of diaphragm valve 10 allows fluid to enter or exit through the port 56, which communicates with chamber 28 between valve body 18 and valve seat body 68 which in turn communicates with cylinder 14 via chamber 72 of valve seat body 68. Spring 84 is positioned in the top portion of center passageway 72 of valve seat body 68, with its bottom portion seated on rim 80 inside of central passageway 72 of valve seat body 68 and with its top rim pressing against diaphragm 26. Before the initial filling of cylinder 14, a vacuum can be drawn on cylinder 14 so as to be filled with load strength to assure diaphragm 26 does not seal off cylinder 14 prior to reaching the desired vacuum in cylinder 14 when valve 10 is in the open position. In the closed position, sufficient torque for closing must be applied to overcome the spring load and to apply sufficient sealing load. To effect shut off, stem 36 is turned to overcome spring 84 and to cause flexible diaphragm 26 to become sealed on valve seat 70. Such action causes communication from port 56 in spud 54 and chamber 28 between valve body 18 and valve seat body 68 to be sealed off from the interior of cylinder 14. There are a number of advantages of the invention diaphragm valve brought about other than by spring 84. The assembly lends itself readily to automation, thus resulting in reduced labor cost. Additional benefits to the user occur as a result of increased flow rates through the valve allowing for faster improved sealing characteristics and the elimination of the dynamic 0 Ring seal currently used in present designs which result in substantial leaker problems during valve oper ation. The invention diaphragm valve preferably uses projection welds and a crimping operation. Spud 54 can be produced as a screw machine part. Lower tube segment 18, for example, has an internal diameter of 1 1 4 inches and a height of 2 1 2 inches from its bottom to the location of diaphragm 26. Diaphragm 26, for example, has a diameter of 1 5 8 inches and a thickness of diaphragm 26 preferably is composed of flexible, neoprenew rubber. Diaphragm 26 is a simple die cut diaphragm. U shaped upper edge 24, for example, has a thickness of 1 8 inch. Upper tube segment 20, for example, has an internal diameter of 1 1 8 inches and a height of about 2 inches from its bottom to the top of its crimped portion 78. Upper tube segment 20, lower tube segment 18, cup 38, and inner tube member 68 are preferably composed of a steel which can readily be produced with high speed drawing equip ment for minimum use of labor and material . Stem handle 44 can be a molded plastic part which is designed for ease of molding and use of low cost plastic materi al. Inner tube member 68, for example, has an internal diameter of 1 8 inch and a height of about 2 1 4 inches. Cup 38, for example, has an internal diameter of 7 8 inches and a height of 1 1 4 inches. In Figure 2, another attachment mode which is shown is diaphragm valve 10 to cylinder 14. Lower tube segment 18 of diaphragm valve 10 is internally threaded. Externally threaded short nozzle 86 is projection welded 88 into port 12 of cylinder 14. The bottom portion of lower tube segment 18 is threaded on to externally threaded nozzle 86. Inner tube member 68 is positioned inside of lower tube segment 18 so as to form outer chamber 28 and inner chamber 72. The lower edge of inner tube member 68 extends to the top rim of nozzle 86. Flat ring 90 is interspaced between lower tube segment 18 and inner member 68 and is sealingly affixed to both lower tube segment 18 and inner tube member 68. Bottom surface ring 90 fits flush against the top rim of nozzle 86.
