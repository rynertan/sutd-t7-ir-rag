## Description
ACID SALTS OF VALPROIC ACIDBackground of the Invention This invention relates to valproate salts, and more particularly to certain alkali metal salts of valproic acid having improved stability. Valproic acid or 2 propylpentanoic acid has come into wide spread use in the treatment of epileptic seizures or convulsions. Most commonly used are valproic acid and its sodium salty the acid is a liquid while the sodium salt is a hygroscopic solid characterized by poor stability. As a result, both have limited utility in the preparation of oral dosage forms. Significant improvements in the forms of valproic acid salts have been achieved as described in copending applications Serial Nos. 545,719 and 545 721, filed concurrently herewith, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. As described in those applications, it has been found that highly stable, non hygroscopic compounds derived from valproic acid can be prepared from equimolar amounts of a valproic acid or diethylacetic acid and b a valproate salt of sodium or calcium. It has been discovered that some of the compounds thus produced are in the nature of an oligomer. For example, the compound formed from valproic acid and sodium valproate has th structure EMI1.1 The polymer contains about 2 to 20, preferably fron about 4 to 12 and most preferably about 8 ot the repeating units. A comparison of infrared spectra and X ray diffraction patterns of sodium valproate, valproic acid and the sodium complex reveal that the above complex I is a chemical entity and not a mixture of the two precursors. Without limitation as to theory, the outer shell of electrons of the sodium atom is filled by coordination to the oxygen atoms of both valproic acid and valproate ions, resulting in a stable complex in which the sodium ion is completely surrounded by oxygen. The calcium salt formed when use is made of a mole ratio of valproic acid and valproate salt is a monomeric salt which has the structure EMI2.1 Thus, as described in the foregoing application, one mole of valproic acid and one mole of valproate salt are coordinately bonded to one half of a calcium atom. It has now been found that an oligomeric calcium salt of valproic acid can be formed with four moles of valproic acid complexed with a calcium ion.Without limiting the invention as to theory, it is believed that the oligomeric salt has the structure EMI2.2 Thus, unlike the monomeric complex formed by the association of one mole of valproic acid and one mole of calcium valproate, the salt of the present invention is oligomeric. The compound of the present invention is a distinct chemical entity, crystalline in nature and has well defined physical and chemical properties. The calcium salt of the present invention can be prepared by reacting one mole of calcium hydroxide with four moles of valproic acid in aqueous media, and tnen removing the water to recover the crystalline complex thus produced. As will be appreciated by those skilled, the inclusion of small amounts of other fatty acids such as diethylacetic acid does not materially alter the complex thus produced in that it simply replaces one or more moles of valproic acid with a biologically inactive acid. The resulting complex is thus formed of two moles of the alkali metal valproate and two moles of valproic acid. The salt is useful in the treatment of epileptic seizures or convulsions, and can conveniently be formulated in solid dosage forms, either alone or in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable diluents in accordance with U.S. Patent No. 3,325,361.Typical diluents or excipients include starch, talcum powder, lubricants, disintegrators, flavoring agents, coloring agents or the like. When used herein in the treatment of epileptic seizures or convulsions, the compounds and compositions of the present invention should be administered in an amount of from 1 to 100 mg kg body weight day, preferably 16 to 64 mg kg body weight day of valproic acid. Having described the basic concepts of the invention, teference is now made to the following examples which are provided by way of illustration, and not by way of limitation, of the practice of the invention. Example This example illustrates the preparation of the calcium salt of valproic acid. One mole of Ca OH 2 74.08 g was dissolved in 100 ml of water in a 500 ml volumetric flask equipped with a stirrer and heating mantle. Four moles of valproic acid 576.84 g were added and the resulting mixture stirred and heated to boiling. The water was distilled off over a period of approximately 2 hours, and the residue in the flask solidified. That solid was isolated and dried by dissolving in hexane, drying over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtering and then evaporating the hexane. The compound obtained has the structure EMI4.1 It will be understood that various changes and modifications can be made in the details of procedure, formulation and use without departing from the spirit of the invention, especially as defined in the following claims.
