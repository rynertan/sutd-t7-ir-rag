# Line protector for a communications circuit.

## Abstract
A protector for a communications line comprises a three electrode gas tube surge voltage arrester 8 as a primary protective device and metal oxide varistors 24, 24a as additional protective devices. In series with each side of the line, is an inductor 22, 22a that serves to isolate the gas tube from the varistors at relatively fast rise times of transient overvoltages. The gas tube, the varistors and the inductors are all mounted in a single housing 26 that is divided into adjacent sections 40, 42 by an insulating member 38 . The gas tube is in one section 40 and the inductors and varistors are in the other section 42 , the inductors being side by side and each coaxial with a pin 32, 32a that is adapted to be connected to the line.
