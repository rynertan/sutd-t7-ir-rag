# A method of manufacturing a semiconductor device, and a device so manufactured.

## Abstract
The method provides for the simultaneous formation of diffused regions 14a, 14b with different diffusion depths. A polycrystalline semiconductor layer 11 , different parts of which are of different thicknesses, is formed on the surface of a semiconductor substrate 1 on which a diffusion mask 7 with diffusion windows 8, 9 and 10 is formed. By impurity diffusion from the surface of the polycrystalline semiconduc tor layer 11 a comparatively shallow diffused region 14b and a comparatively deep diffused region 14a are formed in a single diffusion process, respectively under a comparatively thick part of the polycrystalline semiconductor layer and a comparatively thin part of the polycrystalline semiconductor layer.
