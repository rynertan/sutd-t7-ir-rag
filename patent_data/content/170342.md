# INSULATED SIDING AND METHOD FOR ITS APPLICATION

## Abstract
An insulated siding comprises a panel 10 of hardboard attached by adhesive to a polystyrene foam layer 11 . The rear surface 18 of the foam layer is parallel to the front face 14 of the hardboard panel. The upper and lower surfaces 19, 24 of the foam have parallel V shape with the upper surface having the V inward for collection of moisture. The panels are installed by over lapping the hardboard of two adjacent panels to allow the foam layers to interlock leaving a space for a sponge layer 37 . Channels 27,29 are formed in the foam downwardly between the hardboard and the foam and across the bottom of the foam to provide an intercommunicating network to transmit moisture vapor. The panels can be nailed to the front face of a building using a spacer device 30 to set the distance of the upper edge of the panel from the front face of the building to prevent compression of the foam.
