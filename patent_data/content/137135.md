# SEMICONDUCTOR MEMORY

## Abstract
A semiconductor memory includes first 20 and second 22 memory arrays, each capable of storing data at locations therein, and an address decoder 12 positioned between the first 20 and second 22 memory arrays for decoding address signals input thereto and corresponding to the locations. The address decoder 12 is advantageously configured as a set of ISL 50, 152, 216 gates or MESFET 264 logic gates. When employed with the ISL configuration for an address decoder 12 , it utilizes the same Schottky diodes in the memory arrays 20, 22 as are utilized in the ISL gates 50, 152, 216 . A further refinement provides a precharged circuit 238 for each bit line.
