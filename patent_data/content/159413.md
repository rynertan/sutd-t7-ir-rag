# Reciprocable imprinting apparatus.

## Abstract
An article marking apparatus 10 of the reciprocable impact type wherein an imprinting head 152 is driven from a rest condition is sealed engagement with an inking car tridge 106 through a ninety degree rotation to impact upon the surface of a passing article 43 whereby to imprint indicici information thereon by means of printing type 178 carried by said imprinting head 152 . The imprinting head 152 is pivotally coupled to a pneumatic drive device 224 by a linkage 190, 192, 198 . A guide in the form of a cam slot 212 and follower 206, 204 arranged is provided to define the path taken by the head 152 . The cam and follower arrangement is arranged so that the velocity of rotation of the imprinting head means during an imprinting stroke is uniform at the locations proximate the ends of the strokes, with the velocity of rotation increasing in accordance with uniform rotational acceleration to the midpath of the strokes and decreasing under uniform deceleration to locations proximate the end of the strokes. This prevents shaking and or misalignment of the imprinting head.
