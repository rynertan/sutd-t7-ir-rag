# Process for predicting oxygen precipitation in semiconductor wafers.

## Abstract
A method or technique is disclosed for predicting where oxygen precipitation will occur in semiconductor wafers that are being processed in connection with integrated circuit manufacture the technique is based upon the discovery that such precipitation will occur at resistivity peaks measured prior to any thermal treatment of the wafers. In other words, the technique permits characterizing the wafers by the diametral resistivity profile that is obtained in the initial resistivity measurements, whereby a change in oxygen precipitation can be predicted where compensated intrinsic regions have been measured in the initial measurements.
