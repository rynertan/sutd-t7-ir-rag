# Method and apparatus for individualised postage value computing.

## Abstract
Automatic postage value computing for individually selected services is described using a replaceable individual ized directory memory and a replaceable rate chart memory suitable with all directory memories. Memories are provided with pseudo rate charts that resemble conventional rate charts but serve to either grant or deny access to a rate chart depending upon the user s selection. The use of pseudo rate charts permits an unbundling of the postage value computa tion services to serve the user s needs, without requiring program changes. With individualized directory memory rate selection the updating of user rate chart memories is limited to those rates he has selected. Several embodiments are described.
