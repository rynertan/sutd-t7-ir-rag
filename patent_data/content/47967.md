## Description
HIGH MOLECULAR WEIGHT PIPERIDINE DERIVATIVES AS W STABILIZERS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The Field of the Invention This invention relates to a novel process, compositions containing the compounds prepared according to this novel process and the novel compounds themselves. More specifically, this invention is directed to a process for the synthesis of high molecular weight stabilizer compounds containing pendant piperidinyl groups and to the methods for use of these compounds. Description of the Prior Art Polymers have in the past and continue to provide an attractive substitute for the more traditional types of structural materials e.g., wood or metals because of relatively inexpensive materials and fabrication costs. As polymers continue to find new applications in, for example, the fabrication of automotive parts and building materials, they must also become more durable and capable of withstanding prolonged exposure to a variety of degradative forces. Degradation cf polymers can be caused by exposure to light, heat, moisture and or air. Such degradation is usually manifest by either a partial or total loss of structural integrity, changes in light transition properties, changes in color, loss or reduction of flexibility and or resiliency, or any combination of the above phenomena.Those attempting to avoid polymer degradation have qenerally selected from among three possible approachçst , a eliminaion or reduction of the degradative forces b isolation of the sensitive material from theldegradative forces or c modification of the polymer comcosition to enhance its resistance to the degradative forces The latter approach is generally preferably since it does not require elaborate engineering nor any structural changes in the polymer product environment. There are a variety of additives which have been disclosed in the past as suitable for enhancing the polymers resistance to one or more of the degradive forces discussed hereinabove. These additives hereinafter collectively referred to as stabilizers can usually be physically combined with or engrafted upon the environmentally sensitive polymer thereby prolonging its useful life in the hostile degradative environment.It is not uncommon for polymers to contain a variety of stabilizing materials, i.e., a stabilizer package , each being present for prevention of a particular degradative reaction. One of the more difficult to control of the degradative forces is the irradiation of the polymer by ultra violet light. The impact of such irradiation will, of course, vary depending upon the intensity and duration of exposure, and thus may manifest itself only after a prolonged interval. The irradiation of polymers with ultraviolet light can often times cause cross linking of these materials, thereby reducing its resiliency and or impact resistance.Change in color and opacity are often also effected by prolonged exposure of polymers to UV irradiation. while many materials are known and commercially available as stabilizers against ultra violet light degradation, the degree of protection afforded by such agents is generally concentration dependent and may be geared to a particular limited class of materials.. The prior art is replete with technical articles and patents directed to resolving this complex problem, see for example, i X u oSegradation, Photooxida tion and Photostabilization gut Rolymersllt by Ranby and Raybeck, John Wiley and Sons New York City 1975 at page 369 et seq. A number Q ndered amines stabilizers have been previously disclosed as suitable in the prevention of photodegradation of polyolefins, such as polyethylene and polypropylene, see for example, U. S.Patents 4,006,207 and 4,104,248. Each of the above references disclose a piperdidyl functional compound which is suitable in the light stabilization of synthetic materials, such as polypropylene and polyethylene. In the case of the 207 patent, the stabilizer is a polyurea having piperidinyl functional moieties appended from its backbone. The 248 patent is similar in its disclosure in that the piperdinyl functional moieties are appended from the polymer backbone composed of alkylene groups. As indicated above, the extent of protection which can be imparted to a photosensitive polymer is often times concentration dependent that is, the amount of protection is usually determined by the amount of stabilizer which is capable of incorporation into the sensitive polymer. Where the stabilizer materials are highly effective at low concentrations, the polymer can be protected against degradation without impairment in its physical properties and or processing characteristics. As the concentration of stabilizer required to effectively protect the polymer against W degradation increases, there is also the possibility of phase separation of the stabilizer in the polymer and some impairment in its physical characteristics and processability of the resultant composition. This problem is more pronounced where the stabilizing material is itself a polymer.In order to avoid the types of compatibility problems which are associated with with the use of high concentrations of polymer stabilizers, it is desirable to select a stabi lizer which is phase compatible with the photosensiti me polymer composition.It is, therefore, highly advantageous to have polymer stabilizers which are composedr f the same or structurally similar units as the polymer requiring stabilization. Unfortunately, the preparation of polymer stabilizers is often difficult to achieve and even where such stabilizers can be synthesized, their effectiveness is limited because of the difficulty in achieving phase compatibility with the photo degradable polymer. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, it is the object of this inven tion to remedy the above as well as related deficiencies in the prior art. More specifically, it is the principle object of this invention to provide an effective method for the synthesis of novel polymeric stabilizers which are effective in prevention of W degradation of photosensitive polymers. Another object of this invention is to provide a highly effective polymeric stabilizer which is phase compatible with polyurethanes. It is yet another object of this invention to provide highly effective W stabilizers which are phase compatible with a variety of polymeric materials and which are capable of achievement of substantial protection against photodegradation at relatively low concentrations. The above related objects are achieved by providing a high molecular weight piperidinyl functional polymer stabilizer which is prepared by reaction of 2,2,6,6 tetraalkylated 4 piperidones with a hydroxyl functional amine under reductive alkylation conditions and, thereafter further reaction of the hydroxyl functional portion of the above intermediate compound with a diisocyanate or a di acid. The polymeric product that is obtained will have recurring piperidinyl functionality pendant from the recurring units of the polymer. These high molecular weight polymers and oligomers are especially suitable in the stabilization of polymeric materials, such as films and fibers, and are also highly resistant to extraction from and migration within such polymers. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION INCLUDING PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The novel polymer stabilizers of this invention are prepared by reaction of a cyclic hindered amine, such as 2,2,6,6 tetraalkyl 4 piperidones with a hydroxyl functional amine. The intermidate compound resulting from such reaction can thereafter be further reacted with a diisocyanate or a di acid to yield a high molecular weight product. The alkyl functional piperidone and hydroxyl functional amine are combined in the presence of a platinum catalyst and in a reducing atmosphere under pressure. The reaction is carried out over a period of approximately two to four hours at a temperature in the range of 6o 8o C. The reductive alkylation of the amine in the above manner is essentially complete at this point in time and the desired product can be separated from the reaction mass by filtration and the filtrate hereafter concentrated to a syrup. Any of the by products remaining in this syrupy product can be removed by standard vacuum distillation techniques. The tetraalkylated piperidones suitable in preparation of the above intermediate can have the following structural formulaEMI5.1 wherein R1 and R2 are independently selected from alkyl radicals of 1 6 carbon atoms and R3 is independently selected from hydrogen and alkyl radicals of 1 6 carbon atoms. The hydroxyl functional amite which is suitable in preparation of the foregoing intermediate can be represented by the following structural formulaEMI5.2 wherein R4 is hydrogen R5 is CH2 nNH2, n is 1 to 4,.x is 0 or 1, Y is 0 or 1, z is 1 or 2, with the proviso x y z 3. Once having prepared the intermediate hydroxyl functional compound, it can be further reacted with an appropriate di isocyanate or di acid so as to form polymers and oligomers having piperidinyl functional groups appended from its backbone. The di isocyanate suitable for use in preparation of these high molecular weight stabilizers has the following formula O C N R5 N C O wherein R5 is a divalent organic radical selected from among aliphatic hydrocar bons having 1 to,10 carbon atoms, cyclo aliphatic hydrocarbons having 3 to 10 carbon atoms, polycycloaliphatic aliphatic hydrocarbons having 2 to 20 carbon atoms, alkylene having 2 to 10 carbon atoms, arylene having 3 to 10 carbon atoms, polyarylene having 6 t620 carbon atoms,EMI6.1 wherein Xmay be a valence bond, an alkylene radical containing 1 to. 5 carbon atoms, NR where R is an alkyl radical, oxygen, sulfur, sulfoxide, sulfone diisocyanates with m and n being 1 to 4. Typical aliphatic diisocyanates within the scope of the foregoing formulae include hexamethylene diisocyanate, methylene bis 4 cyclohexyl isocyanate , isophorone diisocyanates. Typical aromatic diisocyanates within the scope of the foregoing formulae include naphthalene1,5 diisocyanate, diphenyl methane 4,4 dissocyanate, tolylene diisocyanate, p phenylene diisocyanate, dichlorodiphenyl methane diisocyanate, dimethyl diphenyl methane diisocyanate, dibenzyl diisocyanate, diphenyl ether diisocyanate, ditolylene diisocyanate and the like. The di acid suitable for use in the preparation of high molecular weight stabilizers include the following acid saltsEMI7.1 wherein at least one of X, Y and Z are selécted from the group consisting of chloride and bromide with the balance being hydrogen. Acid salts within the foregoing formula which are especially suitable in the context of this invention include cyanuric chloride, cyanuric bromide. Typically, the intermediate product, that is the product of the reductive alkylation of the hindered amine and the hydroxyl functional amine , is combined with an appropriate diisocyanate or di acid in a nonpolar organic solvent. The reaction is preferably carried out in a chilled environment, i.e. OOC., and thereafter the reactants allowed to gradually warm to room temperature. The reaction temperatures can be further increased and the reactants allowed to combine further. This step wise increase in temperature permits a greater degree of control over the manner in which the reactants combine and helps to determine the ultimate structure of the reaction product.After the reaction has gone essentially to completion, the solids which are produced can be separated from the reaction medium by filtration, washed in the conventional manner for removal of impurities and dried. The product that is obtained is thereafter evaluated in the conventional manner in order to determine the effectiveness of such product on W stabilization of photosensitive polymers.In addition, the samples prepared in this manner are evaluated in order to determine the extent of compatibility of the stabilizer in the photosensitive polymeric matrix. The Examples which follow further define, describe and illustrate preparation of the method for preparation and evaluation of the compositions of this invention.

The apparatus used both in the preparation and the evaluation of such compositions are standard or as hereinbefore described.
