# PLATINUM CATALYST SUPPORTED ON HYDROPHOBIC,CRISTALLINE SILICA AND COATED WITH A WATER REPELLANT,GAS PERMEABLE POLYMER.

## Abstract
A catalyst structure is provided comprising a hydropho bic, high surface area, crystalline silica SiO₂ lattice es sentially free of aluminum oxide in the SiO₂ lattice such as silicalite, catalyst crystallites of at least one metal from Group VIII of the Periodic Table, for example, platinum on the crystalline silica and in the pores thereof, and the whole provided with an outer, porous, membrane coating of high molecular weight, organic, polymeric material to provide an outer, porous, membrane coating thereon. The platinized, crystalline silica may be slurried with polytetrafluoroethyl ene and a ceramic support coated with the slurry, so that a water repellent, water vapour and hydrogen or oxygen gas permeable, polytetrafluoroethylene matrix is provided on the support with the platinized, crystalline silica dispersed in the matrix. The catalyst is particularly useful for hydrogen isotope exchange between liquid water and gaseous hydro gen or for such exothermic reactions as combining hydro gen and oxygen.
