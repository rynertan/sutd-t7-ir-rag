# Method apparatus for edge rolling plate like stock material.

## Abstract
A plate like stock material is rolled or edged to a desired width on an edging stand of an edger. The edging stand is equipped with a pair of vertical rolls. The central axis of at least one of the vertical rolls of the edging stand is tilted within a suitable angle range toward the same direction as the advancing direction of the stock material or toward the direc tion opposite to the advancing direction of the stock material in a vertical plane parallel to the advancing direction of the stock material, so that the stock material is prevented from ascending and buckling.
