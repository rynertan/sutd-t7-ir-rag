# Cardiac valve prosthesis with valve flaps of biological tissues.

## Abstract
A cardiac valve prosthesis 1 comrises an annular frame 2 through which blood can flow and a valve sleeve 11, 12 of biological tissue with a plurality of valve flaps 14 which can be forced apart by the blood passing through the prosthesis 1 in one direction and which prevent the blood flow in the opposite direction, being brought into a mutually mating position under the pressure exerted by the blood it self. The frame of the prosthesis includes a rigid or semi rigid sent 2 constituted by a tubular body with a ring of apertures 5 and with first 2a and second 2b end edges which, in the implanted position of the prosthesis, are respectively up stream and downstream with respect to the direction of flow of the blood through the prosthesis. The tubular body also has integral axial appendages 4 each of which has respec tive apertures 6 adjacent its free edge. A covering of bio compatible textile 71, 72, 73 completely covers the rigid stent 2 the covering has associated suture stitches some 92, 93 of which extend through the apertures 5 of the said ring to attach the covering 7 to the stent 2 itself. The valve sleeve includes two sheets of biological tissue 11, 12 sut ured 13 together and wound into a tube, the radially outer most one 11 having a shape which substantially re produced the shape of the stent 2 of the frame and the radi ally innermost one 12 whereof, carrying the valve flaps 14 , has a collar end portion 15 which can be turned outwardly of the frame 2, 7 at the first end edge 2a of the stent 3 of the frame 2, 7 . The valve sleeve is fixed to the frame by further suture stitches, some 10 of which extend through the apertures 16 in the ends of the appendages 4 of the frame stent. Other suture stitches 121 connect the end edge of the collar end portion 15 of the radially inner sheet to the cover ing of biocompatible textile.
