# Nipple for stimulation of buccal motions of infants.

## Abstract
The rigid front part 24 forms a vestibular screen which engages between the gum buds and the lips of an infant. Disc part 33 is integral with the sliding bar 28 and moves axially against the biaising force of the spring 31 . The micro switch 26 closes upon that axial movement and starts the emission of a sound, taste, or smell signal. Displacement of the moving portion 33, 28 may be caused by an effort of the tongue exerted onto the rear surface of the disc 33 or by a traction exerted onto the front ring 35 .
