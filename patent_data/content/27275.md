# Ground preparation tool for reforestation.

## Abstract
This invention relates to an auger and to a plow including such auger 17 . This specification discloses an auger 17 which when suitably mounted, is suitable for use even at the difficult terrain encountered in typical reforestation opera tions. An auger 17 in accordance with this disclosure has its axis extending in the direction of movement of the plow and is arranged to rotate in a direction opposing the forward move ment of the plow. The auger 17 has a plurality of generally helical turns. Sections of the ground engaging portions around the periphery of the turns have an angle of attack in a plane at a selected angle to the axis of the auger 17 and other sections have angles of attack in planes at a different angle. These ground engaging sections of the periphery are prefer ably teeth 31 which because of the difference in angles discussed above attack the ground at different cutting angles. The dislodged earth will as is normal with an auger be flung sideways as a furrough is formed, but it will also have a component of motion which is either forward or backwards in relation to the direction of travel of the plow. When, as previ ously explained the auger 17 is rotating to oppose the direc tion of the plow, this forward or backward component of motion will depend on the rate of forward movement of the plow less the rearward displacement of particles caused by the auger 17 . The motion will be forward if the result is positive and backward if the net result is negative.
