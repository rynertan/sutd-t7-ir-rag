# Disc player apparatus with an improved disc clamper.

## Abstract
A disc clamper includes a clamp member 30 for holding a disc 10 against a turntable 12 and a sup port member 26 for supporting the clamp member 30 . The clamp member 30 is provided with a permanent magnet 32 , and the support member 26 has a winding 28 . The winding 20 is coaxially arranged to the magnet 32 . When a certain DC current is applied to the wind ing 28 , the clamp member 30 is subjected to an electromagnetic repelling force F effected between the winding 28 and the magnet 32 . Then, the disc 10 is fixed to the turntable 12 by means of the electro magnetic repelling force F , and the clamp member 30 is mechanically free from the support member 26 .
