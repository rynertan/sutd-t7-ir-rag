# Exhaust gas recirculation system.

## Abstract
An exhaust gas recirculation system, comprising a vacuum actuated valve 12 controlling the EGR flow between the exhaust system and the intake manifold of an engine, sensor means 46, 50, 52 for producing a pressure differential signal indicative of the EGR flow rate and an electrical vacuum regulator 14 comparing said signal with a desired value of EGR flow rate for closing said valve 12 when the difference between both values exceeds a predetermined amount. According to this invention, the pressure differential signal acts pneumatically on the movable membe 154, 164 of valve means within the regulator 14 which are adapted to control the EGR valve 12 , while a counteracting force a representative of the desired value of EGR flow rate is applied electromagnetically through a coil 92 in response to external control signals. For use in exhaust gas recirculation systems for internal combustion engines.
