# Flexible sleeve for bin activator.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a flexible sleeve to fit over the lower flange of a storage bin and the upper flange of a vibratory bin activator to span the gap between these two flanges and prevent leakage of material from the bin through this gap. The sleeve has upper and lower pairs of spaced circumferential ribs to receive strap like clamping members and to hold the clamping members in place during assembly and after assembly and during use of the bin activator.
