# An aqueous latex dispersion paint composition.

## Abstract
An opacified latex paint comprising small particle film forming latex binders in combination with minor amounts of opacifying pigment, and substancial amounts of non film forming polymeric particles plastic pigment provides a semi gloss latex paint composition having excellent hard enamel surfaces along with desirable film integrity properties. The plastic pigment particles are between about 0.1 and 0.5 microns and contain 0.2 to 2 copolymerized monomers containing carboxylic acid groups. The semi gloss plastic pigment latex paint is compounded at pigment volume content PVC between about 30 and 45 and considerably higher than conventional high quality enamel latex paints. The opacified semi gloss paint films exhibit excellent physical properties such as hard enamel surfaces, scrub resistance, burnish resistance, mar resistance, and other desirable paint film integrity properties.
