# Electronically controlled fuel injection apparatus.

## Abstract
In an electronically controlled engine supplying fuel from a fuel injector near an intake port to an intake system, asynchronous acceleration fuel injection is carried out in relation to the secondary differential d²X dt² of intake pipe pressure or intake air flow rate with respect to time t. Since the d²X dt² increases rapidly and accurately after the start of acceleration of the engine, the asynchronous acceleration fuel injection can be carried out rapidly and accurately.
