# Process for preparation of electrophoresis gel material.

## Abstract
Describes a process for controlling the polymerization and cross linked density of electrophoretic gel products useful for separation of bioorganic molecules, which process utilizes photoinitiation. Photoinitiated polymerized gels afford the desired advantages of being ultra thin and having a high electrophoretic resolution with programmable poros ity profiles.
