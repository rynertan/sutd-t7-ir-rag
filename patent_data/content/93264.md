# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CLEANING METALLIC FINES

## Abstract
A continuous method for cleaning metallic particles such as fines, chips and the like, includes continuously introduc ing the dirty metallic particles into a flow path in sufficient quantity to form a bed of the particles. The bed is moved along the flow path toward a discharge point while con tinuously agitating the bed of particles. A gravity flow of a detergent solution is provided along the flow path to flow through the bed of particles contra to their movement. The solution is drained from the path at a point beyond the point at which the particles are introduced so as to carry dirt away from the bed. The apparatus for performing the method includes a rotatable hollow drum 14 having the lowest portion of its second end elevated with respect to the lowest portion of its first end. The particles are continuously introduced to the interior of the drum 14 at a point intermediate the ends thereof. A helical worm 42, 44 mounted to the drum interior extending from the first to second end cooperates with rotation of the drum 14 to transport the particles to the second end of the drum 14 . The detergent solution is introduced into the drum interior to flow over and through the particles, and is drained from the drum 14 near the first end thereof. Following draining from the drum 14 , the solution is continuously passed through a separating device 88 for separating oil and dirt from the solution.
