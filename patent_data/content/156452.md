# Textile yarn spinning machine with supply strand interruption.

## Abstract
Apparatus for use on a textile yarn spinning machine for interrupting the feeding of a supply strand S to a drafting unit 17 upon sensing that the attenuated strand yarn Y from the drafting unit has broken. The strand interrupting means 16 includes means defining a pair of cooperating strand engaging surfaces 51, 61 which, during normal operation, are spaced apart to allow the strand S to pass therebetween, and which are movable into proximate rela tion to pinch the strand S upon the sensing of a broken yarn Y for thereby interrupting feeding of the supply strand.
