## Description
SILANE CONTAINING ISOCYANATE PREPOLYMERS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention pertains to the preparation of silane containing isocyanate prepolymers and more particularly to their use as precursors of polyurethanes having enhanced solvent and moisture resistance as well as improved wet adhesion. BACKGROUND ART Commercial applications of silanes as coupling agents, adhesion promoters and sealants are known to those in the art. Room temperature vulcanizable sealants based on moisture cure of silane end capped polyetherurethanes are also known. Improved adhesion of coating compositions to metallic surfaces offers the added advantage of improving corrosion resistance. Si lanes and silane modified polymers have important commercial applications in several areas.viz.. as coupling agents in composite preparation as demonstrated by E. P. Pludemann. Appl. Polymer.Symposia, 19. 75 1972 as moisture cure wire and cable jacketing resins U.S. 4.343.917 and U.S. 4,328,323 as adhesion promoters U.S. 4,181,687 and as sealants U.S. 3.632.575 and U.S.3.678.010 . Silicones and silicone copolymers silicone alkyd and silicone polyesters are also used as coatings. such as. release coatings. coil coatings and maintenance or marine finishes. Room temperature vulcanizable sealants based on moisture cure of silane end capped polyether urethanes are described in U.S. 4.374.237. These sealant prepolymers wore prepared by the reaction of isocyanate terminated urethane oligomes with gamma aminopropyltrimmethoxysilane. Polyurethanes are reaction products of polyols and polyisocyanates and are useful in many applications including foals. adhesives. sealants and coatings. However, isocyanates are toxic substances and to minimize this hazard of toxycity the monomeric isocyanates are converted to the less volatile prepolymers either by oligomerization or by reaction with a polyol. in order to be competitive with existing polyurethanes, it is imperative that these prepolymers afford polyurethanes with as good or better mechanical and physical properties than those of the existing properties. It is, therefore, an objective of this invention to prepare new isocyanate prepolymers which afford coatings with good wet adhesion, moisture resistance and superior corrosion protection. It is another objective of this invention to provide isocyanate prepolymers which are easily cured by the conventional methods. Other objectives will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon a reading of the specification.

GENERAL PREPARATION OF MOISTURE CURE URETHANE PREPOLYMERS The procedure is illustrated by the preparation of a polymer containing Polyol I. Diol I and toluene diisocyanate. A solution of Polyol I inCELLOSOLVE acetate was dehydrated by azeotropic distillation with toluene before reaction with the isocyanate. The dehydrated solution 694 g containing 150.9 g 0.23 equivalent of Polyol I, 245.9 g 0.593 equivalent of Diol I. 0.56 g stannous octoate was added to 143.2 g 1.645 equivalents of toluene diisocyanate in 96 g CELLOSOLVE acetate at a rate sufficient to maintain the reaction temperature at 350C or less over about four to five hours. The reaction was protected from moisture with a nitrogen sparge. When the reaction solution reached constant viscosity. which required about twenty four hours.the isocyanate content was determined by treatment with dibutylamine and back titation of the excess amine with standard hydrochloric acid. The resulting product had an isocyanate content of 1.0 meg g of solution and Brookfield viscosity 1500 cps 250C and a total solid content of 59 .

Separation of the cured films from glass plates was accomplished by immersion in water. Mechanical strengths of the cured films were then measured. The data obtained are summarized in Table IV. The use of these highly functionalized oligomeric acrylic and vinyl polyols average functionality 5 allows the preparation of highly crosslinked compositions at comparable or reduced levels of diisocyanate. Furthermore, these polyols, I IV, possess hydrophobic baf kbones to improve hydrolytic resistance of the ester based compositions. Optimization is possible through the selection of diols of different chain lengths. For example, the use of lower molecular weight diols.Diol II vs. Diol III resulted in higher Polyol I concentration in the prepolymer. The resulting cured composition possessed higher modulus 100,000 psi but at the expense of elongation 76 cf. Example 24 in Table IV . Polymers w th high modulus without significant reduction in extensibility or tensile strength weze obtained using a combination of short and log chain diols. The composition based on Po yol I, butane diol, Diol IV and TDI had a modulus f 129.000 psi, tensile strength of 5,900 psi and ar elongation of 136 Table IV. Example 26 . It should be further noted that clear film of this composition has aSward Hardness value of 50 60, which substantially higher than the Polyol III Diol III based polymers Sward Hardness 20 . The modulus temperature relationship was also obtained for Polyol ISDiol III TDI and compared with Polyol I Desmodur N NCO OH N 1.1 . The data shown that Polyol I Desmodur N has a higher room temperature modulus. However, the glass transition temperature of both polyurethanes are in the room temperature region and the moduli varied widely with temperature in the 20 30 C range, the 40 120 C range their moduli do not differ greatly. Due to higher cross linking density, the Polyol 1 Desmodur N composition retains its modulus at 120 170 C. while the one component polyurethane looses rigidity rapidly above 150 C.

Polyol I Diol 1 Diol IV TDI. with a modulus Diol 1 Diol III TDI, with a modulus of 14,000, has Sward Hardness value 20. The abrasion resistance was measured with 5 mil thick coatings on cold rolled steel using aTabor Abrador 1 kg weight. CS 17 disc . All the moisture cured films show excellent abrasion resistance as measured by weight loss values summarized in Table V. For comparison, values for the two component Polyol 1 Desmodur N urethane andVMCA DIDP are also included.

Pretreatment of the substrate with a silane or inclusion of the 51 lane in the resin formulation resulting in improved initial and wet resin substrate bond strength. Improvement in wet adhesion to metallic substrates should be of interest in surface coating area. since it has been suggested that if adhesion is maintained, corrosion will not occur. Films were cast on various substrates and alloved to cure without catalyst at ambient conditions for 10 14 days. Adhesion was measured by cross cut tape peel method ASTM D 3359 . Water soaked specimens were tested immediately after wiping off the surface water. Substrates tested included cold rolled steel. phosphate treated steel.aluminum and epoxy primed steel. Adhesion to epoxy primed cold rolled steel was tested because urethanes are often applied as top coats to epoxy primed surfaces in marine and aircraft finishes.The data summarized in Table VI show that end capping of the prepolymer with silane at 2 phr parts per hundred parts of resin resulted in improved wet adhesion. Most significant improvements were observed for the urethane based onPolyol IV Diol II TDI. This system when modified with silane displayed excellent adhesion to all the substrates tested.

Pigmented Formulations Pigmented formulations were prepared using a laboratory media mill. A nasterbatch containing pigment and binder at 4 1 weight ratio and final total solids of 50t was ground to a Hegman Fineness 7.5. Coating compositions were then obtained by diluting the masterbatch with resin solutions to a final pigment binder weight ratio of 0.84 polyvinyl chloride 17 20 and total solids 50 . Coatings of these pigmented compositions on cold rolled steel Q panels showed excellent falling dart impact resistance. and possess Sward Hardness values of about 20. Polyol I BDO Polyol IV TDI had impact resistance value of 160 and Sward Hardness 50 60 suggesting that harder impact resistant coating can be obtained from this Polyol I containing prepolymer Table VII .

The results are summarized in Table VII.The silane modified compositions are clearly more moisture resistant as shown by their superior blister and corrosion resistance ratings.It is to be noted that coatings from Polyol IV DiolII TDI showed outstanding water resistance. After 1000 hours exposure. both the unmodified and the silane modified coatings showed slight blister formation. However, the silane modified coating displayed superior corrosion protection.The decreased tendency to blister on exposure to humid environment can be attributed to the improved adhesion of the silane modified compositions.
