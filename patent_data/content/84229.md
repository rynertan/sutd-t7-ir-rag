# Sealed thrust bearing assembly.

## Abstract
A unitized sealed thrust bearing includes two annular races 12 and 14 with a complement of bearing balls 16 therebetween. One race 12 includes an axially inwardly extending central cylindrical flange 24 and the other race 14 includes a pair of elastomeric sealing lips 36 and 38 , one 36 of which is bonded to the outer edge of the race and the other 38 of which is bonded to the inner edge of the race. The central flange 24 includes an unobstructed radially inwardly facing wall 26 and a radially outwardly facing wall 28 with a radially and axially inwardly facing sealing surface 32 terminating in a radially outwardly extending rib 34 . The inner sealing lip 38 includes an outer sealing wall 42 which in its undeformed state slopes axially and radially inwardly at a greater angle than the sealing surface 32 , and an axially inwardly facing shoulder 44 at the terminus thereof. As the races 12 and 14 are moved axially together during assembly, the sealing wall 42 of the inner lip 38 flexes as it slides past the rib 34 and into engagement with the sealing surface 32 , and the shoulder 44 moves adjacent the rib 34 and the outer sealing lip 36 engages the other race 12 . Axial separating movement of the races 12 and 14 engages the shoulder 44 with the rib 34 to compress the inner lip 38 and retain the races 12 and 14 in their assembled condition.
