# Load carrying trolleys.

## Abstract
The invention relates to load handling trolleys of a type in which a load supporting deck is displaceable into an out of use position and opposed load retaining side walls can be pivoted about rear pivot axes to bring them into mutually inclined positions such that a number of such collapsed trolleys can be nested one into another. According to this invention, the trolley has a wheeled base unit to which the side walls are detachably connectable. The base unit comprises a bridge portion 4 and opposed side beams 2, 3 for supporting the load retaining side walls. Such side beams are connected to the bridge portion by pivot joints 10, 11 so that the side beams can swing into mutually inclined positions together with the side walls.
