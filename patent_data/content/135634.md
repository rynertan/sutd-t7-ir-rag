# FORMING SINGLE WALL BELLS IN DOUBLE WALL PIPE

## Abstract
A method and an apparatus for producing double wall ed thermoplastic pipe with integral bells are disclosed. The pipe has corrugated outer wall 26 that has the bells 50 molded into it, and a smooth inner wall 34 . The inner wall 34 is removed from the bell after the pipe is formed and set. During production, the inner wall 34 is punctured along the bell section 50 to ventilate the chamber 38 between the two walls 26, 34 . This prevents collapse of the outer wall 26 due to reduced air pressure as the air in the chamber 38 cools.
