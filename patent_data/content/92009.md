# IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO OPTICAL CABLE ELEMENTS

## Abstract
In the manufacture, for use in an optical cable element, of a tube of polymeric material, the drawn down extruded polymeric tube is annealed by causing it to travel through at least one elongate oven 20 into which is injected, prefer ably at a position 21 intermediate of the ends of the oven, air or other gas which will have no deleterious effect on, and which is at a temperature sufficient to effect annealing of, the drawn down polymeric tube. Preferably turbulent flow of hot gas is provided within the oven. Use of this method of annealing enables the speed of manufacture to be at least twice the speed of manufacture hitherto achieved.
