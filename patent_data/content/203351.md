## Description
OXYGEN SENSOR ELEMENT AND PROCESS FOR PRODUCING THE SAMEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to an oxygen sensor element, particularly an oxygen sensor element having a built in heater, and a process for producing the same. Oxygen sensor elements practically used are constructed so as to expose one of porous electrodes sandwiching solid electrolyte plates to a gas to be measured a partial pressure of oxygen being Pg and to expose another porous electrode to a standard gas a partial pressure of oyxgen being Pr , and detect a signal voltage Vs which is represented by the Nernst s equation as follows Vs Qn P Pr so as to measure an oxygen concentration in the gas to be measured. In order to take out the signal voltage Vs, oxygen ions should flow through the solid electrolyte plates. When solid electrolyte plates made of ZrO2 partially stabilized with Y203 are used, the signal voltage mentioned above cannot be obtained until the temperature of the oxygen sensor element becomes about 5000C or higher. For example, the combustion control of cars is conducted by measuring the oxygen concentration in an exhaust gas which is a gas to be measured, and adjusting the ratio of air to fuel so as to carry out ideal combustion. In order to reduce a fuel cost of cars remarkably, it is necessary to operate such a controlling system from the start of the engine. Therefore, it is necessary to heat the oxygen sensor element with a heater until the temperature of the oxygen sensor element becomes 5000C or higher by heating with the exhaust gas. Further, in order to control with high precision, it is necessary to maintain the oxygen sensor element at a constant temperature by heating with the heater even after heating with the exhaust gas. Problems of conventional oxygen sensor elements are explained referring to Figs. 10 and 11. Fig 10 is a schematic cross sectional view showing an indirectly heating and solid electrolyte type oxygen sensor of prior art. Fig. 11 is a schematic cross sectional view along the line XI XI of Fig. 10.Such a solid electrolyte type oxygen sensor is disclosed in, for example, Japanese Patent Unexamined PublicationNos. 72286 77 and 130649 81. In Fig. 10, numeral 2 denotes an oxygen sensor element having porous electrodes at the bottom portion of a solid electrolyte type oxygen sensor, and numeral 1 denotes a heater winding around the bottom portion of the oxygen sensor element 2 with a nichrome wire, platinum wire, or the like. The heater 1 is connected to electric wires la and lb for supplying electric power. Numeral 15 denotes a holder for the oxygen sensor element, and numeral 16 denotes a fixing means for holding the oxygen sensor element 2 and attached to the holder 15. The oxygen sensor element 2 comprises a first solid electrolyte plate 3 and a second solid electrolyte plate 4 made of, for example, ZrO2 partially stabilized by 6 mole of Y203 and porous electrodes 5, 6 and 7 formed by, for example, screen printing a platinum paste formed on the solid electrolyte plates as shown in Fig. 11.To the porous electrodes 5, 6 and 7, signal voltage lead out wires 5a, 6a and 7a not shown in the drawing are connected. In the solid electrolyte type oxygen sensor thus constructed, the porous electrode 7 is exposed to a gas to be measured, and the oxygen in pores of the porous electrode 6 is taken as a standard gas the amount of oxygen corresponding to the oxygen flowed from the porous electrode 6 to the porous electrode 7 being supplied from the porous electrode 5 to the porous electrode 6 . The signal voltage represented by theNernst s equation as mentioned above is detected and taken out by the signal voltage lead out wires 5a, 6a, 7a to measure the oxygen concentration in the gas to be measured. Since the prior art solid electrolyte type oxygen sensor is an indirectly heating type wherein the oxygen sensor element 2 is heated from the outside by the heater 1 wound therearound in a coil state, there is a problem in that the heating rate is slow. Further since the heat is not conducted effectively to the oxygen sensor element 2, there is also a problem in that the consumed electric power of the heater 1 is large.In addition, there is a further problem to be improved in that since the distance between the heater 1 and the oxygen sensor element 2 is large, the temperature of the oxygen sensor element 2 changes even if constant electric power is supplied to the heater 1, which results in making it impossible to control the temperature of the oxygen sensor element 2 highly precisely and thus producing errors in measured oxygen concentration values. On the other hand, in order to form a heater in adhesion to the oxygen sensor element, it is necessary to insulate the heater with a material excellent in insulating properties at high temperatures. But since such a material hardly reacts with the solid electrolyte plate, contact of the heater with the oxygen sensor element is very difficult.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of this invention to provide an oxygen sensor element overcoming the problems of the prior art, being low in consuming electric power of heater for heating an oxygen sensor element and excellent in temperature control of the oxygen sensor element.It is another object of this invention to provide a process for producing such an oxygen sensor element. This invention provides a solid electrolyte type oxygen sensor element having a built in heater comprising porous electrodes and solid electrolyte plates containing ZrO2 as a major component placed alternately, and an insulating layer formed on an electrode formed side of one of the solid electrolyte plates so as to have a gas introducing hole and a gas chamber which is formed over the electrode, said insulating layer including therein a heater and containing A1203 as a major component, an oxide binder solid soluble in both the solid electrolyte and the insulating layer being added either to one of the solid electrolyte plate and the insulating layer, or to an insulating thin layer containing A1203 as a major component and formed at an interface of the solid electrolyte plate and the insulating layer. The oxygen sensor element having a built in heater may further contain an intermediate layer which is made of a metal oxide mixture and has a thermal expansion coefficient between that of the solid electrolyte plate and that of the insulating layer, between the insulating layer and the solid electrolyte plate having the gas chamber formed electrode thereon, said intermediate layer having a gas introducing hole connected to the gas introducing hole in the insulating plate and to the gas chamber. This invention also provides a process for producing an oxygen sensor element having a built in heater which comprises constructing a green sheet laminate by forming electrodes on green sheets of solid electrolyte plates containing ZrO2 as a major component, placing a green sheet of insulating layer including a heater, containing A1203 as a major component and having a gas introducing hole on an electrode formed side of the solid electrolyte plate so as to form a gas chamber over the electrode, forming an insulating thin layer containingA1203 as a major component and an oxide binder solid soluble in both the solid electrolyte and the insulating layer at an interface of the insulating layer and the solid electrolyte plate provided that the oxide binder is not previously added to either the solid electrolyte plate or the insulating layer, pressing the green solid electrolyte plates and the green insulating layer and the insulating thin layer if contained, and sintering the resulting pressed product. In the above mentioned process, a green sheet of intermediate layer containing a metal oxide mixture having a linear thermal expansion coefficient between that of the solid electrolyte plate and that of the insulating layer can be placed between the green insulating layer and the green solid electrolyte plate before pressing.

Fig. 11 is a cross sectional view along the line XI XI of Fig. 10.DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS This invention is based on an idea that effective heating of an oxygen sensor element can be attained by adhering a heater for heating the element directly to the element or by a built in heater. Oxygen sensor elements formed by a ceramic green sheet method have a structure, for example as shown in Fig. 11, comprising solid electrolyte plates 3 and 4 having oxygen ion conductivity and porous electrodes 5, 6 and 7 formed on the solid electrolytes. The operational function of the element can be obtained by comparing the oxygen amount in the pores in the porous electrode 6 taken as a standard oxygen chamber and the oxygen amount in a gas to be measured at the electrode 7. In such a case, the oxygen consumed between the electrodes 6 and 7, that is, the oxygen amount corresponding to the oxygen flowed from the electrode 6 to the electrode 7, is supplemented by flowing oxygen from the electrode 5 to the electrode 6.In order to heat the oxygen sensor element directly, a heater for heating the element directly is provided on an insulating layer 8 which is laminated on one side of the solid electrolyte plate 4 having the electrode 7 thereon as shown in Fig. 2.In Fig. 2, numeral 9 denotes a gas introducing hole and numeral 10 denotes a gas chamber for a gas to be measured. The insulating layer 8 having a built in heater 1 should have excellent adhesiveness to the oxygen sensor element after sintering. Al 203 is in general a material having excellent insulating properties at high temperatures. But, it hardly reacts with ZrO2 constituting the solid electrolyte mainly and is not solid soluble with ZrO2. In order to solve such a problem, a material which reacts with both ZrO2 and A1203 is used at an interface of the solid electrolyte plate 4 and the insulating layer 8. Alternatively, such a material is added to either the solid electrolyte plates 3, 4 or the insulating layer 8. For simplicity of the procedure, such a material is added to both solid electrolyte plates 3 and 4. Further, such a material preferably forms a liquid phase at the time of sintering in order to complete the sintering reaction in a short time. Examples of such a material are preferably oxide binders of A1203 SiO2 MgO system and A1203 SiO2 system. Among the A1203 SiO2 MgO system oxide binders, those fallen in the region encircled by curvesA B C D E A in the triangular diagram of Fig. 9 and having a melting point of 15000C or lower are more preferable. In Fig. 9, individual points A, B, C, D andE have the following values in percents by weight A12 3 SiO2 MgO A 14.5 82.0 3.5 B 5.0 65.0 30.0 C 8.3 58.7 33.0 D 22.7 46.5 30.8 E 37.6 45.6 16.8Among the A1203 SiO2 system oxide binders, those containing A1203 in an amount of 5 to 30 by weight andSiO2 in an amount of 70 to 95 by weight are more preferable. The solid electrolyte type oxygen sensor element having a built in heater and applying oxygen ion conductivity having a structure, for example, as shown in Fig. 1 can be produced as follows. A green oxygen sensor element is prepared by forming electrodes 5, 6 and 7 on green sheets of solid electrode plates 3 and 4 containing ZrO2 as a major component. A green sheet of an insulating layer 8 provided a heater 1 thereon and made of an insulator containing A1203 as a major component is placed on the solid electrolyte plate 4 having the electrode 7 thereon so as to form a gas chamber 10 to which a gas to be measured such as an exhaust gas is introduced through a gas introducing hole 9.On the other hand, an oxide binder such as an Al2 0 3 SiO2 MgO system oxide binder or an Al 203 SiO2 system oxide binder which is solid soluble both in the solid electrolyte containing ZrO2 as a major component and the insulating layer containing Awl 203 as a major component, is added to either the solid electrolyte plates 3 and 4 or the insulating layer 8.Alternatively, an insulating thin layer containingA1203 as a major component and the oxide binder as a minor component is formed at an interface of the solid electrolyte plate 4 and the insulating layer 8. Then, the laminated green sheets of the solid electrolyte plates 3 and 4 and the insulating layer 8 are pressed, followed by sintering. More concretely, a process for producing the oxygen sensor element having a built in heater as shown in Fig. 1 can be carried out as shown in Fig. 3. First, a ZrO2 powder partially stabilized with Y 203 is mixed with a conventional organic binder such as polyvinyl butyral, a conventional plasticizer such as butyl phthalate, butyl glycolate, and a conventional organic solvent such as trichloroethane, tetrachloroethylene, n butanol, etc., to give a slurry, which is formed into a ceramic plate a green sheet of 0.25 mm thick by slip casting according to a doctor blade method.Then, the green sheet is cut to give solid electrolyte plates 3 and 4 having predetermined size and shape, e.g.13 mm wide and 40 mm long. Using a platimum paste obtained by making a platinum powder a paste state with an organic material such as ethylcellulose and n butyl carbitol acetate diethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate , a first electrode 5 and a second electrode 6 are formed on the solid electrode plate 3 by a screen printing method. In the same manner, a third electrode 7 is formed on the solid electrode plate 4. Further, in order to form a gas chamber 10 on the electrode 7 after sintering, an organic layer 12 made from e.g.ethylcellulose, polyvinyl butyral, is formed as shown in Fig. 3. As the insulating layer 8, a green sheet of 0.15 mm thick is formed in the same manner as mentioned above from a mixture of 90 parts by weight of A1203 and 10 parts by weight of oxide binder containing 30 by weight of A1203, 53 by weight of SiO2 and 17 by weight of MgO. The green sheet of insulator is cut with the same size and shape as the solid electrolyte plates mentioned above and drilled a gas introducing hole 9 for a gas to be measured such as exhaust gas. Then, a heater is formed by screen printing the same platinum plaste as mentioned above on the insulating layer 8.In order to protect the platinum heater, an insulating layer 11 having a gas introducing hole 9 is placed on the insulating layer 8. The green solid electrolyte plates 3 and 4 and the insulating layers 8 and 11 are laminated and hot pressed at 900C under a pressure of 30 kgf cm2.followed by sintering at 15000C for 2 hours in the air.After sintering, a reaction phase is admitted near the interface of ZrO2 of the solid electrolyte plate 4 and Al 203 of the insulating layer 8 to give strong bonding. Fig. 4 shows the results of heating test of the oxygen sensor element using the heater mentioned above. As is clear from Fig. 4, an electric power necessary to heat the element to 8000C is about 7 W, which value is 1 10 or less of the value of 100 W in the case of the prior art indirectly heating type oxygen sensor. In the above mentioned embodiment, an oxide binder of A1203 S iO2 MgO system having the composition within the region encircled by the curves A B C D E A in the triangular diagram of Fig. 9 is used in order to melt at a temperature lower than the sintering temperature of the element 15000C , to accelerate the sintering of Al 203 and to match the sintering shrinkage with ZrO2.It is also possible to match the sintering shrinkage by adjusting the particle distribution of ZrO2 and Al2O3. It is possible to use as the oxide binder a compound containing 5 to 30 by weight of A1203 and 70 to 95 by weight of SiO2. The oxide binder is mixed in an amount of preferably 5 to 15 by weight in the insulating layer, the remainder being alumina. If the amount of the oxide binder is more than 15 by weight, the amount of liquid phase generated at the time of sintering becomes too much to react undesirably with a sintering table placed in a sintering furnace, whereas if the amount is less than 5 by weight, the reaction phase with ZrO2 cannot be obtained sufficiently to fail to obtain strong bonding. As mentioned above, A1203 is an excellent material for producing the insulating layer 8 due to high insulating properties at high temperatures. But, the linear thermal expansion coefficient of A1203 is greatly different from that of ZrO2. Therefore, when the insulating layer containing A1203 as a major component is directly adhered to the solid electrolyte plate containing ZrO2 as a major component for lamination, there is a fear of destroying the oxygen sensor element due to a stress caused by the difference in thermal expansion coefficients of A1203 and ZrO2 at the time of sintering or during the use at high temperatures.Further, since ZrO2 and A1203 hardly react each other, it is difficult to make them into one body by sintering. In order to solve such a problem, an intermediate layer having a value, preferably a middle value of linear thermal expansion coefficient between that of the solid electrolyte plate containing ZrO2 as a major component and that of the insulating layer containingA1203 as a major component, and having reactivity with both of A1203 and ZrO2 at the time of sintering, is interposed between the insulating layer and the solid electrolyte plate. As the intermediate layer, one made of Zr02 partially stabilized with 6 mole of Y 203 and containing 3 by weight of A1203 is preferable. A solid electrolyte type oxygen sensor element having a built in heater containing the intermediate layer therein has a structure as shown below. That is, the oxygen sensor element comprises a first and second solid electrolyte plates laminated and containing partially stabilized ZrO2 as a major component, porous electrodes individually connected to lead out wires for taking out signal voltages formed on one of the joined surfaces of the solid electrolyte plates and two opposite surfaces of the joined surfaces of the solid electrolyte plates, an intermediate layer made of a metal oxide mixture having a linear thermal expansion coefficient value, preferably a middle value, between that of the solid electrolyte plate and that of an insulating layer formed on one of the solid electrolyte plates so as to have a gas chamber for a gas to be measured over the electrode on the solid electrolyte plate and a gas introducing hole connected to the gas chamber, and an insulating layer containing A1203 as a major component and having a heater built in and a gas introducing hole connected to the gas introducing hole of the intermediate layer. Such an oxygen sensor element can be operated by heating the solid electrolyte plates with the heater, passing a gas to be measured to the gas chamber through the gas introducing hole, and taking out signal voltages with regard to the oxygen concentration of the gas to be measured from the lead out wires. The oxygen sensor element including the intermediate layer can be produced as follows. There are used a green sheet of the first solid electrolyte plate containing partially stabilized ZrO2 as a major component and having two porous electrodes connected to lead out wires for taking out the signal voltages on both surfaces thereof, a green sheet of the second solid electrolyte plate containing partially stabilized ZrO2 as a major component and having a porous electrode connected to a lead out wire for taking out the signal voltage on one surface thereof, a pair of green sheets of the insulating layer containing A1203 as a major component, and having a gas introducing hole and a heater which is placed on one surface of joint surfaces of the green sheets, and a green sheet of the intermediate layer containing a metal oxide mixture which reacts with the solid electrolyte plate and the insulating layer at the time of sintering and has a value, preferably a middle value, of linear thermal expansion coefficient after sintering between that of the solid electrolyte plate and that of the insulating layer, and having a gas introducing hole. The two green sheets of solid electrolyte plates are laminated so as to place the porous electrodes and the green sheets alternately, the green sheet of intermediate layer is laminated on one surface of the solid electrolyte plates so as to form a gas chamber using an organic material which is removed by sintering over the electrode and to connect to the gas introducing hole, and the green sheets of insulating layer are laminated on the intermediate layer so as to connect the gas introducing holes each other, followed by pressing and sintering in the same manner as explained previously. More concretely, the oxygen sensor element having the intermediate layer as shown in Fig. 5 can be produced as follows. The oxygen sensor element 2A can be formed by laminating a first solid electrolyte plate 3 and a second solid electrolyte plate 4, each containing ZrO2 partially stabilized with 6 mole by Y203, having a porous electrode 6 connected to a lead out wire 6a at the joint surfaces of the solid electrolyte plates 3 and 4 and two porous electrodes 5 and 7 connected to lead out wires 5a and 7a at opposite surfaces to the joint surfaces, these lead out wires being used for taking out signal voltages, these electrodes being formed by using a platinum paste by a screen printing method, by laminating insulating layers 8a and 8b made of a mixture containing 90 parts by weight of A1203 and 10 parts by weights of A1203 30 wt SiO2 53 wt MgO 17 wt having gas introducing holes 9a and 9b connected each other to a gas chamber 10 and a heater 1A formed by using the platinum paste by a screen printing method via an intermediate layer 12 made of ZrO2 partially stabilized with 6 mole of Y203 and containing 3 by weight ofA1203 which is placed so as to form the gas chamber 10 over the electrode 7, and, if necessary, by forming a protective layer 14 made of, for example, magnesium spinel on the porous electrode 5. The linear thermal expansion coefficient of the intermediate layer is 8.4 x 10 6 or in the temperature range of 200 to 8000C, said value being in the middle of the value of the first and second solid electrolyte 6 plates 3 and 4 8.8 x 10 OC in the above mentioned temperature range and the value of the insulating layers 8a and 8b 8.0 x 10 6 oC in the above mentioned temperature range . Since the stress due to the difference in the thermal expansion is relaxed by interposing the intermediate layer 12 between the solid electrolyte plate 4 and the insulating layer 8b, the oxygen sensor element 2A is not destroyed at the time of sintering mentioned below or during the use wherein the oxygen sensor element 2A is heated to about 8000C by the heater 1A.Further since the intermediate layer 12 reacts with the both the solid electrolyte plate 4 and the insulating layer 8b, the adhesiveness of the intermediate layer 12 to the solid electrolyte plate 4 and the insulating layer 8b is good, which results in easily sintering individual green sheets into one body to give the oxygen sensor element 2A with excellent mechanical strength. When the thus produced solid electrolyte type oxygen sensor element 2A is exposed to a gas to be measured and switched on, an electric current is passed through the heater 1A until the temperature of the gas to be measured is raised to the predetermined value of 8000C. Since the oxygen sensor element 2A can effectively be heated by the heater 1A, the oxygen concentration of the gas flowed to the gas chamber 10 from the gas introducing hole 9a can be measured easily with high precision irrespective of the temperature of the gas to be measured. Effects of the oxygen sensor element 2A are explained referring to Fig. 6, which is a graph showing the heater heating properties of the solid electrolyte type oxygen sensor element shown in Fig. 5. As is clear from Fig. 6, the consumed electric power necessary for heating the oxygen sensor element 2A to 8000C is about 10 W, which value is about 1 10 of the value of about 100 W in the case of the prior art indirectly heating type oxygen sensor shown inFig. 10. Further, since there is no gap between the heater 1A and the oxygen sensor element 2A and made into one body, the precision for temperature control of the oxygen sensor element 2A is improved to t50C from t200C. Therefore the precision of the oxygen concentration measurement is improved in about 4 times.Further, when the solid electrolyte type oxygen sensor element of this embodiment is used for combustion control of car engines, high precision control of combustion can be carried out from the start of the engine. Therefore, the fuel cost can be reduced in about 10 compared with the use of prior art indirectly heating type oxygen sensor. In the above mentioned embodiment, ZrO2 partially stabilized with 6 mole Y 203 is used as the solid electrolyte plates 3 and 4 in the oxygen sensor element 2A, but the material for the solid electrolyte plates is not limited to such a composition. For example, there can be used ZrO2 partially stabilized with 4 to 8 mole of Y203 or 4 to 8 mole of CaO. Further, the material for the insulating layers 8a and 8b is not limited to the composition comprising 90 parts by weight of A1203 and 10 parts by weight of an oxide binder of A1203 30 wt. SiO2 53 wt. MgO 17 wt. . As the oxide binder, it is preferable to use oxides having the composition encircled by the curve A B C D E A in the triangular diagram of Fig. 9 and oxides of A1203 SiO2 system wherein A1203 is 5 to 30 by weight and SiO2 is 70 to 95 by weight. It is also possible to use A1203 SiO2 CaO system oxides. Further, A1203 single body can also be used, when the particle size is reduced. The sintering temperature of it is close to that of the solid electrolyte, and the sintering shrinkage is matched to that of the solid electrolyte plate. The material for the intermediate layer 12 is not limited to ZrO2 partially stabilized with 6 mole Y203 and containing 3 by weight of A1203. The amount of Awl 203 to be added is limited as explained bellow referring to Fig. 7. Fig. 7 is a graph showing a relationship between the thermal expansion coefficient and the adding amount of A1203 to the intermediate layer shown in Fig. 5.As is clear from Fig. 7, when the A1203 adding amount is less than 1.5 by weight, the linear thermal expansion coefficient becomes large and close to that of the solid electrolyte plate 4, which results in making the adhesiveness of the intermediate layer to the insulating layer 8b worse. On the other hand, when the Awl 203 adding amount is more than 4 by weight, the linear thermal expansion coefficient becomes small and close to that of the insulating layer 8b, which results in reducing the thermal stress relaxation effect even if the intermediate layer is interposed. Therefore, preferable adding amount of A1203 is 1.5 to 4 by weight. Further, as the material for the intermediate layer, there can be used any metal oxides which react with the solid electrolyte plate 4 and the insulating layer 8b at the time of sintering, and have a linear thermal expansion coefficient value after sintering between that of the solid electrolyte plate and that of the insulating layer. For example, there can be used metal oxides of Al 203 SiO2 system, metal oxides of Al 203 TiO2 system. In the above embodiment, the protective layer 14 is formed on the porous electrode 5, but the use of the protective layer is not essential. But the use of the protective layer is advantageous in that adhesion of dusts and peeling of the porous electrode 5 due to collisions of exhaust gas can be prevented, and thus the life of the porous electrode 5, in other words the life of the oxygen sensor element 2A can be prolonged. One embodiment of the process for producing the solid electrolyte type oxygen sensor element 2A ofFig. 5 is explained below referring to Fig. 8. Fig. 8 is a flow chart showing one embodiment of the process for producing an oxygen sensor element in a solid electrolyte type oxygen sensor according to this invention. In Fig. 8, the same reference numbers as used in Fig. 5 are used. A ZrO2 powder partially stabilized with 6 mole Y203 is mixed with a conventional organic binder, a conventional plasticizer, a conventional organic solvent to give a slurry, which is formed into a plate like green sheet 0.25 mm thick by slip casting according to a doctor blade method. Then, the green sheet is cut to give a first solid electrolyte plate 3 having predetermined size. On both sides of the solid electrolyte plate 3, porous electrodes 5 and 6 connected to lead out wires 5a and 6a for taking out signal voltages are formed by screen printing a platinum paste obtained by mixing a platinum powder with an organic material. A second solid electrolyte plate 4 is cut from the green sheet in the same manner with the same size as in the case of the first solid electrolyte plate 3.A porous electrode 7 connected to a lead out wire 7a for taking out a signal voltage is formed on one surface of the solid electrolyte plate 4 in the same manner as in the case of forming the electrodes 5 and 6. On the porous electrode 7, an organic material 13 which can burn at about 3000C and below the sintering temperature, e.g.ethylcellulose, polyvinyl butyral, etc. as a core for forming a gas chamber 10 is formed by a screen printing method or alternatively, a film like material may be adhered . A green sheet of 0.15 mm thick is formed in the same manner as mentioned above from a mixture of 90 parts by weight of A1203 and 10 parts by weight of an oxide binder of A1203 30 wt. SiO2 53 wt. MgO 17 wt. . The green sheet is cut with the same size as the first and second solid electrolyte plates 3 and 4 to give an insulating layer 8b, which is drilled to have a gas introducing hole 9a. On the jointing surface llb of the insulating layer 8b, a heater 1A is formed by using a platinum paste obtained by mixing a platinum powder with an organic material and by using a screen printing method. An insulating layer 8a having a gas introducing hole 9a is formed in the same manner with the same size as in the case of the insulating layer 8b but having no heater on the joining surface 11 . A green sheet of 0.25 mm thick is prepared in the same manner as mentioned above from a mixture of Zero2 powder partially stabilized with 6 mole Y 203 containing 3 by weight of A1203. The green sheet is cut in the same size as the green sheet of solid electrolyte plate 3 and a gas introducing hole 9b the same place as the gas introducing holes 9a of the insulating layers 8a and 8b is drilled to give an intermediate layer 12. The five thus prepared green sheets are laminated so that the green sheets of the solid electrolyte plates 3 and 4 and the porous electrodes 5, 6 and 7 are placed alternately, and the green sheet of intermediate layer 12 is laminated on the porous electrode 7 so as to form the gas chamber 10 over the electrode 7, followed by lamination of the green sheets of insulating layers Bb and 8a in this order so as to face the joining surfaces llb and lla and to connect the gas introducing holes 9a and 9b. The laminated product is hot pressed at 1200C 2 under a pressure of 80 kgf cm , followed by sintering at 15000C for 2 hours in the air. The organic material layer 13 is burnt at about 3000C during the sintering.Then, magnesium spinel is flame sprayed on the porous electrode 5 exposed to the outside to form a protective layer 14. Thus, the objected oxygen sensor element 2A is produced. According to above mentioned embodiment, since the first and second solid electrolyte plates.3 and 4 are laminated, and a pair of insulating layers 8a and 8b forming the heater 1A at the joining surface llb are laminated thereon via the intermediate layer 12, followed by sintering, Thhere are many advantages in that it is not necessary to attach the heater 1 from the outside as the prior art indirectly heating and solid electrolyte type oxygen sensor shown in Fig. 10, the production of solid electrolyte type oxygen sensors becomes easy, and there is no fear of breaking the wire of the heater 1 during the production process. In the above mentioned embodiment, the organic material layer 13 is formed on the porous electrode 7 on the green sheet of the second solid electrolyte plate 4. But the formation of the organic material layer 13 as the core is not always necessary. But the formation of the organic material layer 13 can completely prevent the deformation of the gas chamber 10 caused by the lamination of the intermediate layer 12, so that there is an advantage in that there can be obtained tne largest effective area of the porous electrode 7 with which the gas to be measured flowed to the gas chamber 10 contacts during the operation of the oxygen sensor. As mentioned above, according to this invention, there can easily be produced oxygen sensor elements having a built in heater, which oxygen sensor elements save remarkably the consuming electric power for heating the heater and it becomes possible to control the temperature of the oxygen sensor element with high precision.
