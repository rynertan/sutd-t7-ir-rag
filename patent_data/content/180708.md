# Osmotic drug delivery device.

## Abstract
An osmotic drug or other beneficial substance delivery device comprises a compartment with a chamber formed by an external shell 2 of a microporous material, and an overlayer of a semipermeable membrane 1 substantially covering the outer shell 2 of the chamber. Osmotic agents, adjuvants enzymes, drugs, pro drugs, pesticides and the like are incorporated in the chamber covered by the semiperme able membrane, and external fluids that diffuse into this chamber form solutions and by osmotic pressure are forced through the exposed microporous shell 2 to the exterior of the device at a rate controlled by the permeability of the semipermeable overlay and the osmotic pressure gradient across the shell.
