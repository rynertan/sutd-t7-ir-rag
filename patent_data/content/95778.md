The acid anhydride can be formed by reacting an inorganic salt or organic amine salt of the compound of formula B with 1 to 1.1 times its amount in moles of diphenylphosphoryl chloride, sulfuric anhydride, alkyl chloroformates, aliphatic carboxylic acid chlorides, etc.in a solvent or solvent mixture which does not adversely affect the reaction e.g., acetone, dioxane, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, methylene chloride, chloroform, benzene, ethyl acetate, and N,N dimethylformamide at a reaction temperature of 30 to 20 OC, preferably 15 to 0 OC The compound of formula 1 in accordance with this invention can be easily produced by reacting the compound of formula A with the reactive derivative of the compound of formula B resulting from activation of the carboxyl group, COOH, of the latter, and when R1 in the compound of formula A is a hydrogen atom, sulfonating the reaction product, and then eliminating the protective group R2.When R in the compound of formula B is a protective carboxyl group, the protective group for the carboxyl group is elimined simultaneously with the elimination of Rê. It is not necessary therefore to eliminate the protective groups in a multiplicity of steps. The reaction of the compound of formula A with the reactive derivative of the compound of formula B can be carried out as follows Reaction conditions such as reagents and solvents used in the reaction and the reaction temperature can be properly selected depending upon the types of the compound of formula A and the reactive derivative of the compound of formula B . For example, when the active ester or active amide is used as the reactive derivative, it is used in an amount of 1 to 1.5 moles per mole of the compound of formula A with or without isolating it from the reaction mixture in the preparation of the reactive derivative. The reaction may be carried out at 30 to 40 OC, preferably 10 to 30 OC. Under these conditions, the reaction proceeds easily. When the reactive derivative of the compound of formula B is the acid chloride or acid anhydride, the reaction is desirably carried out in the presence of an alkali metal carbonate, or an organic amine, for example a trialkylamine such as trimethylamine or triethylamine, and N methylmorpholine. The reactive derivative is used in an amount of 1 to 1.5 moles per mole of the compound of formula A , and the reaction proceeds easily at a temperature of 30 to 40 OC, preferably 20 to 10 OC The solvents may be those which do not adversely affect the reaction. Examples include, water, acetone, dioxane, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, methylene chloride, chloroform, benzene, ethyl acetate and N,Ndimethylformamide. These solvents may be used as mixtures. Or those solvents which are hydrophilic may be used in combination with water. After the reaction, the resulting product can be obtained by separating and purifying means known per se, such as solvent extraction, recrystallization and chromatography. When a compound of formula A in which R1 is a hydrogen atom is used, the reaction product obtained as above is sulfonated and then the protective group R2 is eliminated. The sulfonation reaction is carried out by using a sulfonating agent such as sulfuric anhydride or a reactive derivative of sulfuric anhydride. Examples of the reactive derivative of sulfuric anhydride include sulfuric anhydride pyridine, sulfuric anhydride dioxane, sulfuruc anhydride trimethylamine, sulfuric anhydridepicoline, sulfuric anhydride lutidine, and sulfuric anhydride N,N dimethylformamide. Instead of using such a complex formed separately, it may be formed in situ by using trimethylsilyl chlorosulfonate and pyridine, for example, as reagents. In the sulfonation reaction, the sulfonating agent is used in an amount of 1 to 3 moles, preferably 1 to 2 moles, per mole of the reaction product to be sulfonated. The reaction temperature is generallyO to 80 OC, preferably 10 to 40 OC. The reaction may be carried out in a solvent which does not adversely affect the reaction, such as dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, methylene chloride, pyridine and N,N dimethylformamide either singly or in combination. After the reaction, the sulfonation product can be obtained by separating and purifying means known per se such as solvent extraction, recrystallization and chromatography. The sulfonation product may be obtained in the form of various sulfonate salts by using an alkali carbonate, an alkali hydroxide, an ion exchange resin, a quaternary ammonium salt, etc. According to the process of this invention, the compound of formula 1 can be obtained by eliminating the protective group R of the product obtained as above.The deprotection may be carried out by selecting a suitable customary method, such as methods which comprise utilizing acids, bases or hydrazine, or a reducing method depending upon the type of the protective group. The method involving using acids is suitable for eliminating acyl groups e.g., substituted or unsubstituted lower alkanoyl, substituted or unsubstituted lower alkoxycarbonyl, substituted or unsubstituted ar lower alkoxycarbonyl and lower cycloalkoxycarbonyl, substituted phenylthio groups, substituted alkylidene groups, substituted aralkylidene groups and substituted cycloalkylidene groups. Examples of acids which may be used in this method include various inorganic or organic acids such as formic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, p toluenesulfonic acid or hydrochloric acid, and cationic ion exchange resins. The method involving using bases is applicable to the elimination of acyl groups, especially a haloalkanoyl group such as trifluoroacetyl. Examples of bases which can be used in this method include inorganic bases, for example hydroxides, carbonates and phosphates of alkali metals such as sodium and potassium or alkaline earth metals such as calcium and magnesium and organic bases such as alkali metal acetates, trialkylamines e.g., trimethylamine and triethylamine , picoline,N methylpyrrolidone, and N methylmorpholine. When the aforesaid methods involving using acids or bases are carried out in a solvent, hydrophilic organic solvents, water, or mixtures thereof may frequently be used. When trifluoroacetic acid is used as an acid, the reaction may be promoted by adding anisole. The method involving using hydrazine is applicable particularly to the elimination of dibasic acyl groups such as succinyl and phthaloyl. The reducing method is applicable particularly to the elimintation of acyl groups for example halo lowerS alkoxycarbonyl such as trichloroethoxycarbonyl, substituted or unsubstituted ar lower alkoxycarbonyl such as benzyloxycarbonyl and p nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl, or 2 pyridylmethoxycarbonyl and aralkyl groups such as benzyl, benzhydryl and trityl. The reduction can be effected, for example, by using an alkali metal borohydride such as sodium borohydride, or by hydr ogenation using a conventional catalyst. Such protective groups as halo lower alkoxycarbonyl groups and 8 quinolyloxycarbonyl group may be eliminated by treatment with heavy metals such as copper or zinc. The reaction temperature is not particularly restricted, and can be properly selected depending upon the chemical properties of the starting compound and the reaction product, the type of the protective group, and the type of the deprotecting method. Preferably, the reaction is carried out under mild conditions by cooling or warming. When R is a functional derivative of a carboxyl group, it may sometimes change to a free carboxyl group during the reaction or during work up. This case is also within the scope of the above described method. The pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the compound of formula 1 may be obtained as follows A tetra n butyl ammonium TBA salt of the compound of formula 1 may be obtained by neutralizing the compound of formula 1 with tetra n butylammonium hydroxide in water, a hydrophilic organic solvent, or a mixture thereof, or by dissolving the compound of formula 1 in a 0.5M potassium phosphate, monobasic buffer, adding tetra n butylammonium hydrogen sulfate, and extracting the mixture with an organic solvent such as methylene chloride or chloroform. When a compound of formula A in which R1 is S03 TBA is acylated, the reaction mixture after the reaction may be separated and purified by silica gel chromatography to obtain the TBA salt of the compound of formula 1 . A metal salt such as a sodium or potassium salt of the compound of formula 1 may be obtained by dissolving the TBA salt of the compound of formula 1 in water, a hydrophilic organic solvent or a mixture of these, and treating the solution with a strongly acidic ion exchange resin in a sodium or potassium form.

The condensation reaction in the former embodiment may be carried out, for example, by adding a tetrahydrofuran solution of N Boc L y fluorothreonine 3 to an aqueous solution of O benzylhydroxylamine or its hydrochloride, and adding dropwise a tetrahydrofuran solution containing 1 to 3 equivalents of DCC while maintaining the pH of the solution at 3.0 to 6.0, preferalby at 4.5. The reaction in the latter embodiment may be carried out, for example, by adding 1.1 equivalents ofHOSu or HOBt to a dimethylformamide solution of N Boc yfluorothreonine 3 , adding 1.05 equivalents of DCC under ice cooling, stirring the mixture for 3 hours to form an active ester, adding a dimethylformamide water solution of 1.2 equivalents of O benzylhydroxylamine to the active ester, and reacting the mixture at 5 to 10 0C for 5 hours.

The above cyclization reaction can be carried out, for example, by dissolving O benzyl N Boc y fluorothreonine hydroxamate 4 in acetonitrile, adding 1.3 equivalents of triphenylphosphine and carbon tetrachloride, stirring the mixture at room temperature for 18 hours or by adding 1.3 equivalents of triphenylphosphine to the aforesaid acetonitrile solution of the hydroxamate, adding dropwise an acetonitrile solution containing 1.3 equivalents of diethyl azodicarboxylate DEAD at 5 C over the course of 20 minutes and then stirring the mixture at 15 OC for 4 hours. By catalytically reducing the compound of formula 5 in the presence of a reducing catalyst such as palladium carbon, l hydroxyazetidinone of formula 6 can be obtained. The reducing reaction can be carried out, for example, by dissolving 3S, 4R 3 Boc aminol benzyloxy 4 fluoromethyl 2 oxoazetidine 5 in methanol, adding 10 palladium carbon, and hydrogenating the compound 5 under atmospheric pressure for 2 hours. By reducing the resulting l hydroxyazetidinone 6 with, for example, titanium trichloride, 3S, 4R 3 Boc amino 4 fluoromethyl 2 oxoazetidine of formula 7 alpha D20 110.2 c l, CH3OH can be obtained. The reducing reaction can be carried out, for example, by adding a 20 aqueous solution of titanium trichloride dropwise at 10 C over the course of 2 hours to a 50 methanol water solution of l hydroxyazetidinone 6 while maintaining the pH of the methanol water solution at 7 with 10 sodium hydroxide, and stirring the mixture for 2 hours. By treating the compound of formula 7 with, for example, trifluoroacetic acid, 3S, 4R 3 amino 4fluoromethyl 2 oxoazetidine of formula 8 can be obtained.This reaction can be carried out, for example, by dissolving the compound of formula 7 in trifluoroacetic acid cooled at O OC, and stirring the solution for 1 hour. The reaction may be effected by using anisole as a solvent. A compound of formula A in which R1 is S03H or an inorganic salt or an organic alkali metal salt of SO3H can be synthesized, for example, by the method shown schematically below from the compound of formula 8 obtained as above.EMI20.1 3S, 4R 3 amino 4 fluoromethyl 2 oxoazetidine l sulfonic ackd, TBA salt of formula 14 can be obtained, as shown above schemcatically, by benzyloxycarbonylating the compound of formula 8 which can be obtained as above with, for example, benzyl chloroformate to obtain 3S, 4R 3 benzyloxycarbonyl Cbz for short amino 4 fluoromethyl 2 oxoazetidine of formula 12 , sulfonating the compound of formula 12 with a sulfonating agent such as pyridine sulfuric anhydride or 2 picoline sulfuric anhydride complex to form 3S, 4R 3 Cbz amino 4fluoromethyl 2 oxo l azetidinesulfonic acid, isolating it as a TBA salt of formula 13 tta D 12.1 c l,C2H5OH , and thereafter, catalytically reducing the compound of formula 13 in the presence of, for example, palladium carbon. The above benzyloxycarbonylation reaction can be carried out, for example, by dissolving 3S, 4R 3 amino 4 fluoromethyl 2 oxoazetidine 8 in ethyl acetate, and allowing an equivalent of benzyl chloroformate to act on the solution in the presence of triethylamine under ice cooling. The above sulfonation reaction can be carried out, for example, by adding 2 equivalents of pyridinesulfuric anhydride complex to a dimethylformamide solution of 3S, 4R 3 Cbz amino 4 fluoromethyl 2 oxoacetidine 12 , and stirring the mixture at room temperature for 5 days. The catalytic reduction can becarried out, for example, by adding 10 palladium carbon to a dimethylformamide solution of 3S, 4R 3 Cbz amino 4 fluoromethyl 2 oxoazetidinesulfonic acid TBA salt 13 and hydrogenating the TBA salt 13 for 1 hour. When the above sulfonic acid is isolated as an inorganic salt or an organic amine salt instead of isolating it as the TBA salt 13 , there can be obtained a compound of formula A in which R1 is an inorganic salt or organic amine salt of SO3H. A compound of formula A in which R1 is SO 3H can be obtained by eliminating the Cbz protective group for 3S, 4R 3 Cbz amino 4 fluoromethyl 2 oxoazetidinesulfonic acid, TBA salt 13 by the method described hereinabove, distilling off the reaction solvent, dissolving the residue in ethyl acetate, adding formic acid and recovering the sulfonic acid as a zwitterion compound.

The active ester is reacted with ammonia to give N Cbz L yfluorothreonineamide 17 . The reaction of the compound of formula 2 with benzyl chloroformate is carried out, for example, by adding 1.5 equivalents of triethylamine to a 50 dimethylformamide water solution of the compound of formula 2 , and adding.l.5 equivalents of benzyl chloroformate dropwise under cooling with ice.

The reaction of the active ester with ammonia can be carried out, for example, by adding dropwise a tetrahydrofuran solution containing 3 equivalents of ammonia under ice cooling to the active ester solution prepared as described above. The compound of formula 17 obtained as above is reacted with methanesulfonyl chloride in, for example, pyridine, to convert it to N Cbz O mesyl L y fluorothreonineamine 18 which is then sulfonated with a sulfonating agent such as pyridine sulfuric anhydride or 2 picoline sulfuric anhydride complex. The sulfonated product may be isolated as N Cbz O mesyl L y fluorothreonine N sulfo amide, TBA salt 19 . The compound of formula 19 can be converted to the aforesaid intermediate 13 by cyclizing it in the presence of potassium carbonate in, for example, water l,2dichloroethane. The aforesaid reaction of the compound of formula 17 with methanesulfonyl chloride can be carried out, for example, by dissolving the compound of formula 17 in anhydrous pyridine, adding 1.17 equivalents of methanesulfonyl chloride dropwise at less than 50C., and stirring the mixture for 2 hours at less than 50C. The sulfonation of the resulting compound of formula 18 can be carried out, for example, by adding a methylene chloride solution of 4 equivalents of 2picoline chlorosulfonic acid complex dropwise to a methylene chloride suspension of the compound of formula 18 , and boiling the mixture under reflux for 16 hours.
