# Viscosity stabilized aqueous acrylamide polymer solutions and use of viscosity stabilizer compounds.

## Abstract
Selected sulfur containing compounds function as solu tion viscosity stabilizers in aqueous compositions comprising acrylamide polymers containing a redox couple or compo nents which can produce a redox couple in the presence of the solution. The aqueous compositions are useful in post primary oil recovery involving the use of thickened fluids as mobility buffers and mobility control agents.
