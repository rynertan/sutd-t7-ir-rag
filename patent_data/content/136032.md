# TREATMENT OF EFFLUENT LIQUORS

## Abstract
Aqueous effluent liquors such as those derived from the ash slagging of coal are treated to remove halide, eg. chloride ions by heating the liquor to 400 C to 500 C and contacting the vapor with, for example, a fixed or fluidised bed of calcium carbonate maintained at the reaction temperature. During the heating, the temperature is increased at a rate of at least 50 C sec ยน over the range 100 C to 300 C. The treated liquor may be used as a reactant in the ash slagging gasification of coal.
