# VEGETABLE PEELER

## Abstract
A potato peeling machine has a container for receiving potatoes on an abrasive rotary floor. Vanes are attached to the underneath of the floor and are driven unidirectionally by water fed into the container through a permanently attached hose connectable to a mains water tap. The machine has a lid that is placed on to the container and rotated into a locked position. The direction of rotation of the lid is the same as that of flow of the water within the container, so as to enhance the locking.
