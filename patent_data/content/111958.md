## Description
Connection device for block form elements in general, in articular for hydraulics The invention relates to a connection device for elements of block tory, in particular for hydraulics, and which is of particularly useful application by virtue of the combination and configuration of its parts.Modular systems are extremely widespread in many technical fields because they considerably reduce plant construction costs. In the hydraulics and lubrication field, certain parts of the relative circuits are already constructed by means of modular blocks, which can be combined in various ways according to the desired results. The fixing together of said blocks is done by tie rods which join said blocks by passing through them in the direction of their width or length, according to requirements. Said fixing system, provided for connecting together modular blocks in which high pressure fluids operate, has the drawback of undergoing an elongation, with consequent loss of sealing properties, which is proportional to the pressure and in particular to the tie rod length.These drawbacks further increase if the circuit operates in a hightemperature environment. From the constructional viewpoint, tie rods of length which differ according to the number of blocks to be combined together must also be constantly available.The object of the present invention is to provide a connection device for blocks in general, in particular for hydraulic or lubrication circuits, which properly resists mechanical stresses generated by the high pressures, even at high temperature, without any loss of sealing properties and without tie rods of the most various lengths having to be kept in store.This and further objects of the invention will be apparent to the expert of the art on reading the description and claims given hereinafter.According to the invention, the connection device is characterised essentially in that a through bore provided in an element is partly occupied by an externally and internally threaded bush, and comprises a step against which there abuts the head of a screw, of which the shank emerges from the block in order to be screwed into a further bush which partly occupies the through bore in another element.The invention is illustrated by way of non limiting example in the figures of the single accompanying drawing, in which Figure 1 is a section through the system for fixing together a set of coupled blocks, andFigure 2 is a section through the bore of the fixing device.In the figures, the reference numeral 1 indicates a first block, and 1 and 1 a second and third block, which are in stacked relationship and are connected together. In the usual manner and therefore not further illustrated in detail, the blocks can contain ducts, valves, slide valves etc., which are traversed or occupied by high pressure fluids, for example lubricating greases or oils.In each block there are provided identical through bores 2, of which only one is therefore represented and described. Said bores comprise a first threaded part 3, a second non threaded part 4 of equal diameter to the first, and a third non threaded terminal part 5 of diameter less than the preceding bores and which, with the preceding part, forms a step 45.Said bores are engaged by the fixing elements, of which two are provided for each bore, namely a conventional socket head screw 6 and an internally and externally threaded bush 7 provided at one end with a slot 9 into which to fit the end of a screwdriver for screwing the bush into the bore. On assembly, assuming that a bush has already been screwed into the threaded part of the relative bore 2 in the lowest block 1 , the socket head screw 6 is inserted into the bore 2 of the overlying block 1 and is screwed tightly into said bush 7. A bush 7 is then screwed in situ into the bore 2 of the block 1 , a socket head screw 6 is inserted into the bore 2 of the block 1 , and is screwed into the underlying bush 7. A bush 7 is then screwed into the block 1 , and the upper block 1 is then connected by screwing the screw 6 into the bush 7. The assembly is cyclic in terms of the aforesaid operations, and thus theoretically an indefinite number of blocks can be fixed together using only two pieces bush and screw .
