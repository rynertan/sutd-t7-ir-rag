# Process for preparation of metal vessels.

## Abstract
A process for preparation of metal vessels by lap bonding circumferential open end portions 3,4 of pre formed outer and inner seamless metal cup members 2,1 to each other with an adhesive layer 11 interposed between the open end portions 3,4 of both the members 2,1 , by heating the fitted portions 5a of both the outer and inner members 2,1 so as to melt the adhesive and by subsequent controlled cooling the fitted portions 5a so that the temperatures of the fitted portions of both the outer and inner members are substantially equal to each other just before solidification of the adhesive.
