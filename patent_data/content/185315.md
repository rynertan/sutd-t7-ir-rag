## Description
The present invention is concerned with 1 methylcarbapenem antibiotics having a quaternary mono or bicyclic heteroarylium alkyl group which is internally alkylated in the 2 position. Thienamycin is a known carbapenem, broad spectrum antibiotic of the formula Other derivatives of A are also known. The present internally alkylated mono or bicyclic 2 quaternary heteroarylalkyl substituted carbapenems are believed to have an antibiotic spectrum comparable to Sankyo U.S. Pat. No. 4,377,591 and Japanese patent publications 56 199682 and 56 60852 Shionogi Japanese patent publications 57 145086 and 57 145087 and Roche U.K. patent publication 2 092 147A, all describe azabicycloheptene antibiotics having a 2 position substituent joined through a thioalkylene bridge. U.S. Pat. No. 4,189,493 to Bristol Myers discloses externally alkylated heteroarylium alkylthioazabicycloheptene antibiotics. U.S. Pat. No. 4,465,672, U.S. Pat. No. 4, 260,627 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,267,188, all assigned to Merck Co., Inc., disclose 2,6 substituted 1 carba 2 penem 3 carboxylic acids wherein the 2 substituent can be substituted or unsubstituted alkyl or aryl. However, none of the above 2 references specifically describe the carbapenem compounds of the present invention. GB A 2 119 371 describes carbapenem derivatives wherein the 2 position is substituted by a heteroarylalkylenethio unit. Compounds having a methyl group in the 1 position are not disclosed in this document. EP B 0 007 614 shows the equivalence for some few penem and carbapenem derivatives whose substituent in the 2 position is always linked to the basic penem or carbapenem structure via a sulfur atom. The invention is embodied in a compound having the formula wherein is substituted or unsubstituted pyridinium, pyridazinium, pyrimidinium, pyrazinium, pyrazolium, triazolium, imidiazolium, thiazolium, oxazolium or isoxazolium, which is optionally substituted by one or more of the groups independently selected from OH, NH₂, NHCH₃, OCH₃, COO C₁ C₃ alkyl, C O NHOH, phenyl, N CH₃ ₂, C O CH₃, C O N CH₃ OH, SO₃H, SCH₃, CHO, COOH, S O CH₃, SO₂CH₃, SO₂NH₂, SO₂NHCH₃, CN, CSNH₂, CONH₂, CONH CH₃ , CH N OH, up to C₆ alkenyl, C₁ C₆ alkyl, which alkyl group is optionally substituted by one or more of the groups independently selected from OH, NH₂, NHCH₃, OCH₃ COO C₁ C₃ alkyl, C O NHOH, N CH₃ ₂, C O CH₃, C O N CH₃ OH, SO₃H, SCH₃, CHO, COOH, S O CH₃, SO₂CH₃, SO₂NH₂, SO₂NHCH₃, CN, CSNH₂, CH N OH, CONH₂ and CONH CH₃ then all stereoisomers are included as mixtures or as separate isomers. Representative examples of preferred pyridinium groups are those having the formulae Representative examples of preferred monocyclic other then pyridinium are those having the following formulae Preferred emdodiments of the internally alkylated subject compounds are given by the following formula. The compounds of Formula I include inner Zwitterion salts when Y is COO , eg. or, when Y is other than COO , salts with an external, physiologically acceptable counterion, Z , eg. R Compounds of Formula I include the stereoisomers as mixtures and as separate isomers. Compounds having the stereochemistry shown below are preferred where contains a chiral center, the side chain chirality leads to diastereometric products. The products can be separated by conventional methods, used as mixtures, or synthesized stereospecifically. The compounds of the present invention are valuable antibiotics, active against various Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria and accordingly find utility in human and veterinary medicine. Representative pathogens which are sensitive to antibiotics I include The compounds of this invention may be used in any of a variety of pharmaceutical preparations. They may be employed in capsule, powder form, in liquid solution, or in suspension. They may be administered by a variety of means those of principal interest include topically or parenterally by injection intravenously or intramuscularly . Compositions for injection, a preferred route of delivery, may be prepared in unit dosage form in ampules, or in multidose containers. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions, or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for reconstitution, at the time of delivery, with a suitable vehicle, such as sterile water. Topical applications may be formulated in hydrophobic or hydrophilic bases as ointments, creams, lotions, paints, or powders. The dosage to be administered depends to a large extent upon the condition and size of the subject being treated as well as the route and frequency of administration the parenteral route by injection being preferred for generalized infections. Such matters, however, are left to the routine discretion of the therapist according to principles of treatment well known in the antibiotic art. In general, a daily dosage consists of from about 5 to about 600 mg of active ingredient per kg of body weight of the subject in one or more treatments per day. A preferred daily dosage for adult humans lies in the range of from about 10 to 240 mg of active ingredient per kg of body weight. Another factor influencing the precise dosage regimen, apart from the nature of the infection and peculiar identity of the individual being treated, is the molecular weight of the chosen species of this invention I . The compositions for human delivery per unit dosage, whether liquid or solid, may contain from 0.1 to 99 of active material, the preferred range being from about 10 60 . The composition will generally contain from about 15 mg to about 1500 mg of the active ingredient however, in general, it is preferable to employ a dosage amount in the range of from about 250 mg to 1000 mg. In parenteral administration, the unit dosage is usually the pure compound I in sterile water solution or in the form of a soluble powder intended for solution. The preferred method of administration of the formula I antibiotic is parenteral by i.v. infusion, i.v. bolus, or i.m. injection. For adults, 5 50 mg of Formula I antibiotic per kg of body weight given 2, 3, or 4 times per day is preferred. Preferred dosage is 250 mg to 1000 mg of the Formula I antibiotic given two b.i.d. three t.i.d. or four q.i.d. times per day. More specifically, for mild infections, and particularly urinary tract infections, a dose of 250 mg t.i.d. or q.i.d. is recommended. For moderate infections against highly susceptible gram positive and gram negative organisms, a dose of 500 mg t.i.d. or q.i.d. is recommended. For severe, life threatening infections against organisms at the upper limits of sensitivity to the antibiotic, a dose of 1000 t.i.d. or q.i.d. is recommended. For children, a dose of 5 25 mg kg of body weight given 2, 3, or 4 times per day is preferred a dose of 10 mg kg t.i.d. or q.i.d. is usually recommended. Antibiotic compounds of Formula I are of the broad class known as carbapenems or 1 carbade thiapenems. Certain of these carbapenems are susceptible to attack by a renal enzyme known as dehydropeptidase DHP . This attack or degradation may reduce the efficacy of the carbapenem antibiotic. Inhibitors of DHP and their use with carbapenem antibiotics are disclosed in the prior art see published European Patent Applications No. 79102616.4 filed July 24, 1979 Patent Number 10573 79102615.6, filed July 24, 1979 publication no. 0007614 and No. 82107174.3, filed August 9, 1980 publication no. 72014 . The present I compounds may, where DHP inhibition is desired or necessary, be combined or used with the appropriate DHP inhibitor as described in the aforesaid published applications. The cited European patent applications 1. define the procedure for determining DHP susceptibility of the present carbapenems and 2. disclose suitable inhibitors, combination compositions and methods of treatment. A preferred weight ratio of I compound DHP inhibitor in the combination compositions is about 1 1. A preferred DHP inhibitor is 7 L 2 amino 2 carboxyethylthio 2 2,2 dimethyl cyclopropanecarboxamide 2 heptenoic acid or a useful salt thereof. These combination compositions and their use is another embodiment of the present invention. The compounds of Formula I may be prepared by any convenient process.
