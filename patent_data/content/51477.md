# Spindle orientation control method and apparatus.

## Abstract
A spindle orientation control system having a speed control circuit 1 and a position control circuit 4 for rotating the spindle 7 of a machine tool at a commanded speed and for stopping the spindle 7 at a designated position with a high accuracy, the speed control circuit 1 decelerating the spindle drive motor 6 on the basis of a spindle stopping command. When a predetermined speed has been attained, a counter contained in the position control circuit 4 is triggered by a one revolution pulse generated whenever the spindle 7 makes one full revolution, whereby the counter begins to count up position pulses each one of which is generated whenever the spindle rotates by a predetermined angle. After a preset predetermined number of pulses have been counted, operation shifts from the speed control mode to a position control mode, and said counter is preset to a number of pulses corresponding to the angle from the present position of the spindle to the desired stopping position. Said pulse number is counted down by the position pulses and, at the same time, a voltage having a level which is proportional to the content of the counter is applied to the spindle drive motor 6 , thereby reducing its rotational speed. When the content of the counter reaches a value of zero, the spindle 7 is stopped at the predetermined position. Adjusting the value preset in the counter makes it possible to correct a spindle stopping position error that results from a difference in the position of the leading or trailing edge of the one revolution pulse, said differences arising because the position of the leading or trailing edge of the one revolution pulse varies depending upon the direc tion of spindle rotation.
