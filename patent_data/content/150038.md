# Dot printing device.

## Abstract
A dot printing device includes a head 25 having a plurality of head pins P1 to P9 , a dot driver 2, 22 for selectively energizing the head pins P1 to P9 according to dot data, a character generator 10 , and a data processing unit 1, 3, 4 for causing N bit dot data constituting desig nated character data to be generated sequentially by the character generator 10 according to input character desig nation data, and supplied to the head driver 2, 22 . The data processing unit 1, 3, 4 causes a plurality of N bit dot data corresponding to the input character designation data to be generated from the character generator 10 according to input character designation data and italic printing data, and supplies the lowest bit of the N bit dot data and N 1 bits with predetermined delay times with respect to the lowest bit to the head driver 2, 22 .
