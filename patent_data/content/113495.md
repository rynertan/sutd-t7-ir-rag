# Vehicle transmission with power takeoff.

## Abstract
A tractor transmission comprises an input shaft 19 driving a gearbox input shaft 10 through a three speed splitter gear 20 . The gearbox comprises a main gear which is a top shaft synchronised dual clutch gear with clutches C1, C2 and selectors A,B . This gear is followed by a range gear providing direct drive or a step down ratio or reverse under the selection of selectors D,E . A PTO drive shaft 16 is driven by way of a clutch C3 and gears 17 . The input drive is from the shaft 10 rather than the shaft 19 so that the splitter gear 20 influences the PTO speed. A given PTO speed can be maintained without increasing engine speed or ground speed by shifting up to overdrive in the splitter gear 20 and shifting down compensatorily in the main gearbox.
