# Gas cooled modules for electrical components.

## Abstract
A heat dissipating system for cooling circuit chips or modules is described. The system includes circuit chips 30 which are vertically mounted, an inert gas 40 at an el evated pressure being contained within an encased module 20 for providing an enhanced thermal coupling between the chips contained therein, and the walls 22, 26 of the encased module, whereby heat removal from the chips or modules is increased. This enhanced thermal coupling is combined with a reduction in the temperature of the wall 22 of the encased modules so as to reduce the thermal resistance between the surrounding gas and the chips or modules to be cooled, whereby heat removal from the cir cuit chips or modules is substantially increased. The gas is maintained at a pressure above 240 kPa 35 psi , preferably above 480 kPa 70 psi . Helium is a suitable thermally con ducting inert gas.
