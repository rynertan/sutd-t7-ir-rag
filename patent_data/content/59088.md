# Silicate solutions, their production and uses as binders.

## Abstract
Aqueous alkali metal silicate solutions are made by dissolving in alkali silica powder that includes insoluble impurities and putting the impurities into stable suspension with a suspending agent such as a cellulose derivative. When used as a foundry binder the solutions give improved early strength and improved breakdown properties.
