## Description
LOW TEMPERATURE, STORAGE STABLE MIXTURES OF POLYESTER PREPOLYMERS AND FLOW MODIFIERS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION It is well recognized that polyisocyanates which are liquid at room temperature have obvious processing advantages over solid polyisocyanates see for instance U.S.Pat. No. 4,115,429. Polyisocyanates such as the commercially available and widely used toluene diisocyanate TDI and 1,6 hexamethylene diisocyanate are potentially harmful due to their relatively high vapor pressure and accordingly, certain safety precautions are employed to minimize harmful physiological effects. For this reason, various attempts have been made, either to start with diisocyanates that are normally liquid at room temperature and to reduce their physiological effects by certain procedures or to start with diisocyanates that are solid at room temperature and to convert these into liquid form.In both cases, however, one usually obtains either isocyanates of higher valency, i.e., tri or higher polyisocyanates or higher molecular weight diisocyanates or a combination of these effects. Important diisocyanates which are solid at room temperature and which are readily available on a large commercial scale are 4,4 diphenylmethane diisocyanate and the 2,4 isomer thereof which melt at 390C and 34.50C, respectively. Attempts have already been made to liquefy both the 4,4 diphenylmethane diisocyanate and a mixture of the 4,4 diphenylmethane diisocyanate and a small amount of the 2,4 isomer. Thus, for example in U.S.Pat. No. 3,644,457, 1 mol of a diphenylmethane diisocyanate is reacted with from about 0.1 to about 0.3 mol of poly 1,2 propylene ether glycol. While the products made according to this patent have met with commercial success, they still suffer from a serious drawback. Specifically, it has been found that these adducts generally will crystallize anywhere from 50C to as high as 250C. In fact, when supplied in commercial quantities, these adducts are generally transported in heated trucks. Additionally, in order to thaw the materials it is generally necessary to heat them to somewhere in excess of 50 C to 600C. While in warmer climates there may not be any problem, in colder areas where the product may be stored in tanks over a period of time, this tendency to crystallize can become a very serious problem.Similar attempts to form liquid diphenylmethane diisocyanates have been described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,384,653 and 3,394,164. The attempts to liquefy in both of these instances were based on the addition of, in one case, a trihydrocarbyl phosphate, and, in the other case, small amounts of phosphoric acid. In any event, the storage stability of both of these types of products is again quite good around room temperature, but as the temperature decreases, both types of materials tend to crystallize. Isocyanato terminated prepolymers of about 600 to about 4500 molecular weight, e.g., prepared from the reaction of an excess of 4,4 diphenylmethane diisocyanate MDI with i linear or slightly branched polyesterdiols with without polyestertriols reaction products of lower aliphatic glycols with without small amounts of glycerol and alkanedicarboxylic acids , or ii dipropylene glycol, comprise products generally having melting points of about 100C to about 30 C, and higher, depending primarily on the amount and structure of the polyol employed. Quasiprepolymers containing, by weight, from about 50 to about 60 of the polyol segment e.g., a polyol from adipic acid, ethylene glycol, 1,4 butanediol are generally liquid products at room temperature.When the MDI content is increased to about 60 , or more, the resulting quasiprepolymers are oftentimes crystalline products in the 15QC 200C range. Quasi prepolymers comprised of MDI and about 10 158 of the di and or tripropylene glycol s are oftentimes crystalline at about 150C 200C. In this state, the quasi prepolymers are more difficult to process, exhibit greater tendency towards dimerization and trimerization reactions, and detract from optimal physical characteristics of the end polyurethane product. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It has now been found quite unexpectedly indeed that there can be prepared novel low temperature, storage stable, liquid mixtures of 1 isocyanato containing prepolymers derived from the reaction of i a polyol and ii an organic polyisocyanate characterized by a methylene group bonded to two benzene nuclei as, for example, 4,4 diphenylmethane diisocyanate, and 2 a nonhydroxylcontaining flow modifier, hereinafter developed in detail. The non hydroxyl flow modifier is a normallyliquid compound and compatible with the prepolymer, or it may be a low melting solid which forms a normally liquid, compatible mixture with the prepolymer. The addition of a few parts by weight , e.g., about 3 parts of flow modifier per 100 parts by weight of prepolymer can result in compatible mixtures whose melting points are measurably lower than the prepolymer per se.In general, a practical commercial lower limit is approximately 5 parts flow modifier per 100 parts prepolymer. Thus, in the practice of the invention, there can be prepared novel liquid compatible mixtures comprising prepolymer s and flow modifier s which exhibit storage stability for long periods of time at temperatures substantially below room temperature, for example, at about 50C to 100C, and lower, for several days to several weeks, e.g., at least 100 hours, and longer.Many of the novel liquid mixtures exhibited compatibility, did not crystallize or phase separate, and remained chemically stable for at least one week and upwards to several weeks at temperatures at about OOC, and lower, e.g., 5 C. Thus, the novel mixtures can be transported over great distances and stored for prolonged periods of time at low temperature, and remain in a compatible liquid state ready for the intended use. Handling and processing problems which are associated with polyisocyanate compounds crystallizing or melting in the 150C to 300C and higher range are substantially eliminated by using the novel mixtures described herein. Moreover, it has been observed that dimerization and trimerization reactions are greatly reduced.The novel storage stable liquid mixtures are readily cast or metered through pumps, and have very low vapor pressure and therefore are substantially physiologically harmless. The novel liquid mixtures comprising prepolymer and non hydroxyl flow modifier can be employed in the NCO OH polyaddition reactions to prepare a wide variety of polyurethane products, especially microcellular products such as, for example, integral skin microcellular polyurethanes. Such products exhibit a broad spectrum of highly desirable and or improved characteristics. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION It has now been found that a wide variety of nonhydroxyl containing flow modifiers can be admixed with the prepolymers to form novel low temperature, storage stable, liquid mixtures. The flow modifier and prepolymer are compatible and soluble with each other forming a solution which does not phase separate for long periods of time at low temperatures. The flow modifier has a boiling point above about 1500C and is normally liquid, i.e., liquid at about 200C, or is a relatively low melting solid which forms with the prepolymer a compatible, storage stable, low temperature liquid mixture. The flow modifier consists essentially of a carbon and hydrogen atoms, preferably in the form of a monovalent and or polyvalent hydrocarbon group such as a C1 C18acyclic group, a C5 C7cyclo aliphatic group including unsubstituted and the mono and poly C1 C4 alkyl substituted c5 c7cycloalkyl, and or a benzenoid ring nucleus, e.g., mono , fused , and bridged nuclei, including the partially or fully hydro genated ring substituted counterparts thereof b etheric oxygen in the form of oxyalkylene group s and c at least one group having the following structural configuration 1 EMI5.1 urethane group 2 EMI5.2 ester group 3 EMI5.3 carbonate group 4 EMI5.4 acetal group or 5 OR hydrocarbyloxy group wherein each Rl, individually, is hydrogen or a monovalent hydrocarbon group, and wherein each of the unsatisfied bonds of the above structural units is monovalently attached to separate carbon atoms of the flow modifier molecule. In one aspect of the invention, novel flow modifiers are contemplated which contain one to fiveEMI5.5 groups, preferably 2 to 3 such groups. The term oxyalkylene , as used herein, characterizes an oxy atom bonded to an acyclic or alicyclic carbon atom to form, as by way of illustrations, the unitEMI5.6 wherein d is an integer of from 3 to 6.Illustrative divalent oxyalkylene groups include oxyethylene, oxypropylene, oxytrimethylene, oxytetramethylene, chloromethylsubstituted oxyethylene, phenyl substituted oxyethylene, dimethyl substituted oxyethylene, cyclohexyleneoxy cyclopentyleneoxy, and methyl substituted cyclohexyleneoxy the mixed oxyalkylenes of the above such as oxyethyleneoxypropylene, oxyethyleneoxybutylene, and oxypropyleneoxybutylene mixed oxyalkylenes which contain minor amounts of oxymethylene groups and the random and block oxyakylenes of the foregoing and the like. The flow modifiers contemplated in the practice of the invention are characterized by at least one oxyalkylene group and upwards to 25, and more, of such groups. In various embodiments a suitable upper limit is 8 oxyalkylene groups.Preferred flow modifiers are characterized by oxyethylene or oxypropylene group s or mixtures of such groups with without minor amounts of other oxyalkylene group s with at least one of the foregoing structural units. The average molecular weight of the flow modifiers which are employed in the preparation of the novel storage, stable liquid mixtures can vary over a wide range, e.g., from about 100 to a few thousand, e.g., approximately 3000.

The flow modifiers embraced by Formula I supra are apparently novel compositions, and when the variable x is greater than 1 such as 2 or 3 and upwards to 8 and even 25, many of them are particularly preferred from a commercial viewpoint such as those depicted structurally inFormulas IA, II, and IIA. Novel flow modifiers which are especially preferred include the urethane products resulting from the reaction of 2,4 and or 2,6 toluene diisocyanate and monoether of mono and of polyC2 C3alkylene glycol of the formula EMI19.1 tb VIII tb SEP 0 SEP 2,4 SEP and or SEP 2,6 tolylene tb SEP II SEP 2 tb SEP and or SEP SEP 2,4 SEP and or SEP 2,6 tolylene tb wherein R is alkyl or aryl, preferably methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, sec butyl, pentyl, hexyl and phenyl wherein x is at least one, preferably 1 or 2 and upwards to 8 and wherein oxyC2 C3alkylene represents oxyethylene preferred and oxypropylene and when x is 2 or more oxyC2 C3alkylene can also be oxyethyleneoxypropylene, desirably where the mol ratio of the oxypropylene moiety to the oxyethylene moiety is in the range of from about 75 25 to about 25 90.

However, novel liquid mixtures comprising quasi prepolymers from a diphenylmethane diisocyanate and polyesterdiol, and optionally, a small amount of higher polyesterpolyol s having hydroxyl equivalent weights between about 500 to about 2000 are most desirable in the manufacture of high performance microcellular urethane elastomers including integral skin microcellular urethane products. For instance, integral skin microcellular urethane articles, e.g., shoe soles, can be obtained which are characterized by a resilient core of substantially uniform density and an integrally formed, tough, substantially continuous surface skin surrounding said core, the boundary between said skin and said core being characterized by a rather abrupt change in density. The skin is itself flexible, essentially devoid of blemishes, impervious to oil and water, directly accepts paint without first requiring primers to its surface, and exhibits superior flex life, high tear strength, and generally superior abrasion resistance. In the practice of preferred embodiments of the invention, there can be achieved liquid, compatible, low temperature, long standing, storage stable solutions comprising prepolymer and flow modifier and outstanding urethane products therefrom, e.g., molded microcellular integral skin shoe soles, by utilizing prepolymers derived from a diphenylmethane diisocyanate and linear polyesterdiols and or slightly branched higher polyesterpolyols which have hydroxyl equivalent weight in the range of from about 500 to about 1500, preferably from about 750 to about 1250, and most preferably approximating 1000. In general, the functionality OH of the polyesterpolyol is in the range of from 2 to about 3, desirably 2 to about 2.5, preferably 2 to about 2.2, and most preferably 2 to about 2.1. The linear and or branched polyesterpolyols may be prepared by processes which are well known in the prior art. For example, the polyesterpolyols may be manufactured by polyesterification of polycarboxylic acids, hydroxycarboxylic acids including lower oligomers thereof, or lactones with glycols or higher polyols, including mixtures of the foregoing, generally in the presence of a suitable catalyst and at an elevated temperature. The polyesterpolyols derived from epsilon caprolactones and other monomers are adequately described in U.s. Pat. No.3,169,945 and generally comprises the reaction of one or more lactones with one or more polyols. Additional polyesterpolyols are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,666,724 and 3,957,753. The disclosure of the foregoing patents are incorporated into this disclosure to the extent necessary to illustrate the scope of the invention. Other polyesterpolyols, as indicated previously, are derived from the esterification reaction of at least one polycarboxylic acid with at least one polyol. Illustrative polycarboxylic acids include succinic acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid, pimelic acid, suberic acid, azelaic acid, and the like. Anhydrides of the acids can also be used. Illustrative polyhydric compounds include the aliphatic glycols such as ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, 1,3 propanediol, 1,4 butanediol, 1,5 pentanediol, 1,6hexanediol, l,10 hexanediol, neopentylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, and others. Examples of other polyhydric compound include the trihydric alcohols such as glycerol, l,l,l trimethylolethane, l,l,l trimethylol propane, and 1,2,6 hexanetriol pentaerythritol sorbitol and the like.The C4 Cl0alkanedioic acids are preferred, in particular, glutaric acid and adipic acid, whereas the saturated C2 C6aliphatic diols are most suitable. The polyisocyanate compound used in the preparation of the isocyanato terminated prepolymer is characterized by a methylene group CH2 , each valence of which is separately bonded to a carbon atom of a benzenoid nucleus such as a diphenylmethane diisocyanate MDI , for example, 4,4 diphenylmethane diisocyanate, 2,4 diphenylmethane diisocyanate, mixtures of 4,41 MDI and 2,4 MDI, a mixture of 4,4 DI and the carbodiimide thereof such as Isonate 143 L, mixtures of 4,4 MDI and minor amount of the 2,4 and 2,2 MDI isomers, and the like. The isocyanate compound and polyesterpolyol are reacted in a ratio of NCO groups to OH groups of at least about 2.5 1, but a more suitable range of NCO equivalents per OH equivalent is from about 2.7 to about 24 NCO to one OH .A NCO OH ratio in the range of from about 3.7 1 to about 12 1 is preferred with a most preferred ratio being from about 7 to about 12 NCO equivalents per one OH equivalent. Available polyester MDI prepolymers which are particularly useful in the practice of the invention include Isonate 240 and Mondur E 501. These two products are polyester prepolymers from ethylene glycol 1,4 butanediol adipates and carbodiimide modified 4,41 diphenylmethane diisocyanate.They have improved low temperature stability in comparison with the corresponding prepolymers derived from the essentially pure 4,4 MDI isomer. The addition of the flow modifiers of the invention to these carbodiimidemodified prepolymers not only further improves their low temperature stability but very unexpectedly and surprisingly, indeed, also improves their chemical stability. It has been observed that the tendency towards the formation of insoluble isocyanate trimers and dimers under ambient storage conditions of from about 100C to 300C is markedly reduced. Mixtures of flow modifier and prepolymer have been observed to be clear after one year whereas Isonate 240 and Mondur E 501 normally will turn milky in 6 months or less, indicating dimer and trimer formation. A few parts, e.g., 2 3 parts, of flow modifier added to 100 parts of prepolymer can result in a compatible solution whose melting point is measurably lower than the prepolymer per se. In general, it is desirable to incorporate at least about 5 parts by weight of flow modifier into 100 parts by weight of prepolymer. Though in some instances 35 parts, and even more, of flow modifier per 100 parts of prepolymer can be admixed together to form low temperature, storage stable, compatible solutions, it is desirable to employ about 5 to about 30 parts, preferably from about 7 to about 25 parts, and preferably still from about 7 to about 20 parts, of flow modifier per 100 parts of prepolymer. The optimum commercial range will, to a large degree, depend on the choice of the flow modifier and prepolymer.One or more flow modifiers can be employed in the practice of the invention providing the resulting novel mixture is a normally liquid, compatible mixture. Additional ingredients which do not contain hydrogen active with isocyanato groups, e.g., surfactant, blowing agent, dye, can be incorporated into the novel mixture.

Examples 16 21 A series of flow modifiers designated, for convenience, as Reaction Products A, B, C, D, and E, were prepared by reacting a diisocyanate with an ether alcohol. The resulting isocyanate ether alcohol reaction products were then examined for compatibility with Mondur E 501 following the procedure described with respect toExamples 1 15 supra. Example 16 Synthesis of Reaction Product A. In this experiment, Butyl Carbitol diethylene glycol monobutyl ether having a molecular weight of 162 and a functionality of 1 was reacted with tolylene diisocyanate 80 2,4 and 20 2,6 tolylene diisocyanate having a molecular weight of 174 and a functionality of 2 at an OH NCO ratio of 1. Starting at room temperature, a clean dry jar was charged with 32.5 gms of Butyl Carbitol and to this 17.4 gms of tolylene diisocyanate was added.The jar was capped tightly and agitated by gentle shaking to mix the components. No heat was applied for the first 10 minutes. The resulting exotherm of the reaction raised the temperature to 550C. At this point, additional heating was used. The jar was placed in a hot air oven and maintained for 3 hours at 700C. to complete the reaction. After allowing the reaction product to cool to room temperature overnight, the following observations were made. The reaction product, hereafter referred to asReaction Product A, was slightly viscous, clear liquid with a dark yellow color. Example 17 Synthesis of Reaction Product B. In this experiment 29.0 gms of Methyl Carbitol diethylene glycol monomethyl ether with a molecular weight of 120 and a functionality of 1 were reacted with 21.0 gms of 80 20 2,4 2,6 tolylene diisocyanate using the process noted in Example 16 above. After 10 minutes the exotherm of this reaction had increased the temperature of the mixture to 600C. The reaction mixture was heated for 3 hours at 700C. and cooled overnight to room temperature. The product Reaction Product B was a transparent dark yellow viscous liquid. Example 18 Synthesis of Reaction Product C. In this experiment Butyl Carbitol was reacted withIsonate 125M high purity 4,4 diphenylmethane diisocyanate . In this reaction 405.6 gms of Butyl Carbitol were charged to a 1 liter reaction flask, maintained under a nitrogen atmosphere, fitted with a stirrer, thermometer, reflux condenser, and feed inlet. The internal temperature of the reaction flask was raised as necessary by heating the outside of the flask with a heat mantle controlled by a rheostat. The Butyl Carbitol was preheated to 940C. The 4,4 MDI was added in three increments with good agitation. The first addition of 4,4 MDI of 125.7 gms brought the temperature of the mixture to 1390C. within 5 minutes.This being an exothermic reaction, the reaction product mixture was allowed to cool to 620C. before the second 4,4 MDI addition of 127.7 gms was made. After 20 minutes a temperature of 940C. was recorded and the third addition of 4,41 MDI 59.2 gms was made. The total amount of Isonate 125M added was 312.6 gms. With moderate heating a temperature of 920C. to 1180C. was maintained for 2 hours to complete the reaction. Agitation was maintained throughout the entire procedure. Upon cooling to room temperature the product Reaction Product C of this reaction was observed to be a very viscous liquid with large crystals forming. At 35 C., it was a hazy liquid with a viscosity of 12,620 centipoises. At temperatures above 950C., it was a clear light yellow liquid. Example 19 Synthesis of Reaction Product D. Reaction Product D was prepared by reacting ButylCarbitol and Mondur MR a crude polymethylene polyphenyl polyisocyanate having an isocyanate content of about 31.5 by weight and an isocyanate equivalent of about 133.4 . A 1 liter reaction flask was charged with 405.6 gms of Butyl Carbitol. A total of 333.5 gms ofMondur MR was required for a complete reaction at a stoichiometric NCO OH ratio of one. The Butyl Carbitol was preheated to 820C., and with good agitation the polyisocyanate added in three increments. The exotherm from the first addition of 144.1 gms of polyisocyanate raised the temperature to 1200C,, within 10 minutes. A second addition of 109.7 gms of polyisocyanate was made when the temperature subsided to 920C., and after 20 minutes a peak temperature of l090C was noted. The third increment of 79.7 gms of polyisocyanate was added at 99.50C. Moderate heating and continued agitation was used to maintain the temperature between 990C. and 1070C for 2 hours to complete the reaction. The resulting product ReactionProduct D was a dark brown liquid with a viscosity of 342,800 centipoises at 230C., and 66,400 centipoises at 350C. Although the color was very dark it was transparent with no solids evident. Example 20 Preparation of Reaction Product E UCON Lubricant 50HB550 TDI . In a manner similar to the preceding Examples and using the appropriate equivalents 1 1 of UCON 50HB660 and 2,4 2,6 tolylene diisocyanate, there was preparedReaction Product E, a yellow transparent liquid with a viscosity of 536 centipoises at 230C. Reaction Products A, B, C, D, and E were examined as flow modifiers for Mondur E 501 in the manner described with respect to Examples 1 15 supra. The data are set forth in Table II infra.
