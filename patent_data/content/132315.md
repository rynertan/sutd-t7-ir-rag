# Process for producing butylene polymers having molecular weights in the range of from about 400 to 5000 molecular weight.

## Abstract
Polybutene polymers and polybutene 1 polymers are prepared from a feed stream which has been fractionated to remove no more than about 50 wt of the cis 2 butene originally present.
