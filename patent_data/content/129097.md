# Stroke control valve for a radial piston pump.

## Abstract
A stroke control valve 20 is used for controlling the communication of fluid to the stroke control chamber 32 of a main radial piston pump 12 which is supplied by a charge pump 14 . The output of both pumps is connected to separate inlets 26, 28 of the valve which also has an outlet 30 to the chamber 32 . At high output pressure of the main pump 12 the valve 10 moves to connect this output to the outlet 30 for destroking whilst at the same time blocking the inlet 26 from the charge pump 14 by a check valve 44,46 . At low pressure the valve 10 moves back and the charge pump outlet is connected to the chamber 32 .
