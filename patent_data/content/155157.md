## Description
This invention relates to a decorative carpet comprising a pile carpet. In discotheques and other public places it has become popular to provide flashing lights which may be controlled by stroboscopic apparatus or by audio equipment which actuates predetermined sequences of lights in response to audio tones emitted by the equipment. Such displays are generally in the form of upright screens having light bulbs arranged in them. It has also been proposed to provide recesses in the floor with light bulbs in the recesses, the bulbs being wired to a power source which causes selective actuation of sequences of bulbs. It is known to use optical fibres for decorative purpose by providing a number of fibres each having one end illuminated by a light source and another end visible to an observer as a point of light. Such arrangements have been used as purely decorative lamps or light displays see example US A 4 034 215 , and have also been embodied in functional articles such as a wig US A 3 758 771 and a flag or pennant US A 4 110 818 . The present invention relates to decorative carpets having a backing and a pile, the pile having a first end portion affixed to the backing portion and extending to a second end portion remote from the backing. Such a carpet is generally known. One object of the invention is to provide such a decorative carpet with a novel decorative effect, without affecting the functional nature or tactile characteristics of the carpet, and also without affecting its visual appearance when the novel decorative effect is inoperative. To this end, the invention is characterised by a plurality of fibre optic cables upstanding from the backing, the fibre optic cables having first end portions coterminous with the second end portion of said pile, and the cables extending in a curve through the backing to second end portions of the cables exposed to a light source. In this way the first end portions of the cables are clearly visible when lit up but do not project beyond the pile so as to be subject to damage. The fibre optic cables extend in a curve through the backing thereby preventing cracking or other damage being caused to the cables. The cables are also cushioned by the carpet pile as they run along the underside of the backing to the light source, so that they are not damaged by the weight of people walking on the carpet. The first ends of the fibre optic cable terminals may be disposed at random or may be set in predetermined patterns. The cables may be run as bundles to a common light source or to a number of light sources. In the latter case the light sources may be connected to an audio system so that each light source is actuated in response to a corresponding audio tone this is especially effective in, for example, discotheques and dance halls. Colour may be provided at the exposed cable ends by arranging one or more colour filters between the light source and the cable. A number of filters may be provided, and these may be arranged for sequential exposure to the light so as to give a display of changing colours at the terminals for example when a number of light sources are provided these may be arranged in combination with a rotating disc which carries a variety of colour filters, so that the effect on the covering is of differently coloured lights moving across the floor. Such sequential control of lights and colours can be controlled by microprocessor. An embodiment of this invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawing, in which Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram of a lighting system for a decorative covering of the invention, and Fig. 2 is a plan view of the covering of Fig. 1. In this embodiment of the invention a covering in the form of a carpet 1 has threaded through it a number of CROFON fibre optic cables 2 each 0.254 mm 0.01 inch in diameter. The cables 2 are applied to the carpet 1 by threading them through the carpet s fabric backing 3 and the pile 4 until they stand proud of the pile 4, securing them to the backing 3 with adhesive tape or other means and then cutting their ends so that they extend only as high as the pile 4, as shown in Fig. 1 of the drawings. Various numbers of the cables 2 are bundled together, for example into two bundles 5 as in Fig. 2 forming the letters N and L respectively. Each bundle 5 is then led under the carpet 1 to a respective light source indicated generally at 6 in Fig. 1, in which only one of the bundles 5 and sources 6 is illustrated. The source has a mains powered lamp 7 whose outlet is a small aperture corresponding in size generally to the overall size of the end face of the bundle 5 so that the light produced in the lamp 7 is concentrated on the cables 2. Between the lamp 7 and the bundle 5 is a rotatable disc 8 having at intervals around its face translucent colour filters 9 and blank non translucent areas. The disc 8 is driven by an electric motor 10 also powered by mains electricity. In use, the lamp 7 is switched on and the disc 8 rotated. Light from the lamp 7 passes through the filters 9 and emerges coloured. The coloured light passes along the bundle 5 of fibre optic cables 2 and appears at the cable terminals among the pile 4 of the carpet 1, creating a coloured pattern as represented by the N in Fig. 2. As the disc 8 rotates another coloured filter 9 comes before the lamp 7, with the result that the colour of the N on the carpet 1 changes. Further rotation creates other colours and non illumination alternately, the non illumination occurring when the non translucent areas of the disc 8 are adjacent the lamp. Similarly the pattern represented by the L in Fig. 2, connected to a separate light source 6, changes colour independently of the N . The bundles may be formed from alternative cables 2 from each pattern N and L , so that the patterns change colour in similar fashion. Alternatively the cables 2 can be disposed with their end faces arranged around the disc 8 so that each pattern on the carpet is gradually changing colour along its length. This can best be achieved by a large outlet, or aperture, of the lamp 7 providing light through a number of colour filters 6 simultaneously.
