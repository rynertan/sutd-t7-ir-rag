# Method of joining Ni base heat resisting alloys.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a method of joining Ni base heat resisting alloys which comprises forming, under an inert atmosphere, an aluminum layer on at least surfaces to be joined of a constructional member which has been divided into a plural number of parts composed of a Ni base heat resisting alloy reinforced by a γ phase in Ni₃Aℓ system, followed by heating the parts so that said aluminium is dispersed in said Ni base heat resisting alloys, the joining portion joint contains substantially no β NiAℓ phase and a γ Ni Aℓ phase is dispersed therein to join the parts. The joint provided by the method according to the present invention has been improved in its strength and corrosion resistance at a high temperature. Further, the method according to the present invention can be carried out with a high degree of freedom in supplying a joining filler metal.
