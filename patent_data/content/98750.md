# STABILISATION OF A MUTANT MICRO ORGANISM POPULATION

## Abstract
This invention provides a process for stabilising a popu lation of a mutant micro organism in a bioconversion system whereby growth of revertant cells is suppressed. The process involves limiting a nutrient which is essential for cell growth so that the cells selectively grow on a growth carbon source rather than on a non growth carbon source which is present. The revertant cells being suppressed have a similar ability as the parent strain of the mutant micro organ ism to grow on the non growth carbon source in the biocon version system. The non growth carbon source in the bioconversion system is metabolised to an extracellular accumulating quan tity of a desired metabolite, e.g., toluene is converted to muconic acid.
