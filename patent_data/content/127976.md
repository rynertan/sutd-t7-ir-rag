# MODIFIED POLY OXAZOLIDONE URETHANE COMPOSITIONS

## Abstract
Isocyanate reactive prepolymers containing at least one terminal epoxide group with an associated secondary hyd roxy group and grafted thereto a polymeric moiety derived from polymerizing an ethylenically unsaturated monomer are disclosed. When reacted with isocyanate, these prepolymers form thermoset compositions which comprise oxazolidone groups in the backbone that are separated by ester linkages, urethane linkages in side chains attached to the backbone, and polymeric moieties derived from one or more ethyleni cally unsaturated monomer grafted to the polymer backbone.
