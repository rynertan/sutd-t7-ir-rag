# Slitter assembly for double fold bottomer apparatus.

## Abstract
A slitter mechanism 14 for use in a double fold bot tomer apparatus 10 employed in making bags from start ing flush cut tubes is described which gives precise, high speed side marginal tube slitting in order to permit subse quent downstream gluing and folding operations. In prefer red forms, the slitter mechanism 14 includes a bag end separating assembly 30 having a vacuum manifold 36 and a cooperating adjacent deflector bar 44 serving to separate end portions of the sidewalls of a moving tube. A sequentially rotatable blade 32 is also provided which first enters the open end of the moving tube between separated wall portions, overtakes and slits the leading side margin of the tube, and then stops with a trailing slitting edge situated within the tube open end subsequent bag movement causes the trailing tube side margin to engage and be slit by the sationary blade edge.
