## Description
Portable folding orthopedic seat This invention relates to an improved portable orthopedic seat unit insert for providing support for the lower back of the sitter and for relieving lower back discomfort. Seat inserts heretofore in use have generally been for the purpose of obtaining ventilation to the rear of or under the sitter or to provide cushioning. They have generally provided merely a flat back portion and a flat seat portion hinged together. They have usually not sought any special approach to support of the lower back and therefore have not usually had any special shaping. Even when they have attempted to provide some lower back support they have provided for little, if any, possibility of adjustment to adapt the unit for different individuals. For example, the Manley U.S. Patent No. 2,081,111 shows an automobile cushion wherein two back support pads are immovably mounted to a canvas backing. Such adjustment as there is, is obtained by moving the canvas backing up and down the seat. If the user moves his position, he risks shifting the position of the cushion or letting it slide down toward the seat. The Sopko, Jr., U.S. Patent No. 3,145,054 shows a folding portable chair seat with a back supporting pneumatic cushion that extends laterally across the back and engages the spine along the small of the back. It is not adjustable as to height but only as to the amount of inflation. These devices do not solve the problem to which the present invention is directed because they lack the necessary adjustment for enabling adaption to different peol or even for different times for the same person. Moreover,they do not apply the support to the exact locations where support is needed. A great many people find regular chairs and sofas uncomfortable and ordinary automobile seats unbearable. For example, for a long cross country flight in a commercial airline, although many people may find the seats sufficientl comfortable and view the taking of such a trip as a very uncomfortable experience Similarly, many people find that their automobile seats lack comfort most people put up with the discomfort, but those who have a back problem find riding in such seats very difficult, and they often find prolonged driving to be an excruciating experience. An important object of the present invention is to provide a portable orthopedic seat insert which greatly adds to the comfort of the sitter, especially one having back problems. Another object of the invention is to devise a seat insert which provides adequate support where it is needed on each side of the lower part of the back and thereby relieves lower back discomfort. Another object is to provide a readily portable folding seat insert which can be taken aboard planes, put in automobiles, and generally moved from place to place, bei compact when carried and being convenient to carry In a presently preferred form of the invention, a semi rigid back member and a similar seat member each have a rigid quadrilateral marginal frame supporting a resilient cushion affording free air passage therethrough, and an air permeable seat cover encloses the frame and the cushion means. Preferably, the resilient cushion comprises a first series of spaced apart elastic bands bridging between front and back or top and bottom frame members and a second series of spaced apart elastic bands bridging between a pair of side frame members, the frame members constituting the quadrilateral marginal frame. In this presently preferred form of the invention the vertical support means may be a vertical bar extending from the bottom of the marginal frame of the back member to the top thereof, on the forward surface thereof.The bar may have a series of locking recesses along each of its side edges. A carrying handle may be swivel attached to the bar near the hinge, so that it extends into the sector between the seat and the back when the unit is opened Also, in this presently preferred form of the invention there is one padded, generally elliptically shaped back support member on each side of the bar, and each backsupport member comprises a rigid rear portion lying in a plane tilted outwardly from the bar at an angle of about 150 from the back member, a resilient cushion supported on the rigid portion, and a couer enclosing the cushion and the rear portion.In this particular form of the invention, readily releasable latch means is secured to the connecting member and has locking fingers that engage the locking recesses of the vertical bar, to hold the padded members at any desired height. Brief Description of the Drawings In the drawings Fig. 1 is a view in side elevation of an automobile seat on which rests a portable folding orthopedic chair insert embodying the principles of the invention. The seat portion has been broken in the middle in order to conserve space, and the bottom of the automobile seat has been broken off for the same reasons. Fig. 2 is a fragmentary view in front elevation of the installation of Fig. 1, with the automobile seat cutaway to conserve space, and with portions of the chair insert cutaway to expose one side of the locking means and one corner of the back frame. Fig. 3 is a view in section taken along the line 3 3 in Fig. 2. This view shows the two back supporting members as different in structure, in order to illustrate two different types of suitable structure, although usually the two members will be identical and of either type here shown. Fig. 4 is a view in side elevation on a reduced scale showing the chair insert folded vor carrying, with the hand of a user being inserted in the handle. Fig. 5 is a view of the chair insert of Figs. 1 4 with its cover removed, as well as the rigid support member and the back support assembly. Fig. 6 is a view in perspective of a modified form of chair insert also embodying the principles of the in invention Fig. 7 i5 a view in rear elevation of the chair insert of Fig. 6.Description of Some Preferred EmbodimentsThe unit of Figs. 1 4 A unit 10 shown in Figs. 1 5 illustrates a preferred embodiment of the invention, although many changes in specific construction can be made, as will be readily apparent. The unit 10 comprises a seat member 11 and a back member 12 connected together by suitable hinging means.This hinging means may comprise a pair of hinges 13 and 14 or a single piano hinge, or any suitable type of structure. The seat member 11 may be constructed in any way desired, preferably being semi rigid and having some cushioningDifferent models may be made one way and other models another way so as to afford variety of choice to the purchaser. For example, as best shown in Fig. 5, the seat member 11 may have a quadrilateral rigid frame 15 with a front marginal frame member 16, a rear frame member 17, secured to the hinges 13 and 14, and side frame members 18 and 19. In between the front and rear frame members 16 and 17 extend two series of spaced apart resilient strips or bands 20 and 21, one above the other, and in between the frame members 18 and 19 and in between the bands 20 and 21 extends a series of spaced apart resilient strips or bands 22, preferably in two layers. The bands 20,21, and 22 may, if desired, be interwoven.This imparts both resiliency and cushioning, and affords plenteous ventilation passages for air circulation.The frame 15 and the strips 20, 21, and 22 are then enclosed in a loosely woven cover 23 Figs. 1 and 2 , which therefore permits relatively free flow of air for ventilation. As shown in Fig. 1 the forward portion 24 of the side frame members 18 and 19 may be bent downwardly, to increase comfort at the seat edge. The back member 12 may be similar. As shown inFig. 5 it may have frame 25 with a bottom member 26 connected to the hinges 13 and 14, a top member 27, and side frame members 28 and 29. The lower portion of the side frame members 28 and 29 may comprise a bend 30 See Fig. 1 to increase comfort. In the back 12, well spaced resilient bands 31 extend from side to side.No vertical bands are required, though they may be used.There is thus plenty of ventilation, and the whole is enclosed in a loosely woven cover 32 Figs. 1 and 2 .The wide back helps to prevent the apparatus from sinking into the soft cushioning of the automobile seat back, thereby helping to transfer the proper support to the back of the user. The novelty of the invention and its primary effect resolves both in the combination of the back 12 and the seat 11 in such a way that, they support each other and help to obtain a proper positioning and also in a particular superstructure mounted on the back 12, soon to be discussed.The seat unit 10 is constructed so that the seat member 11 may rest on a regular automobile seat 33 or a chair, sofa, or airplane seat , and the back member 12 rests against a back 34 of the seat 33. However, the seat member 11 and back member 12 may be shaped to fit into bucket seats, if desired. A vertical flat bar 40 runs from the bottom frame member 26 to the top frame member 27. This bar 40 serves as a rigid support member providing rigid support in the vertical direction, but it may have same resilient flexure in a twisting mode for a purpose hereinafter mentioned. It is also provided along each side edge 41,42 with two series of openings 43 and 44, which may be drilled thereinto. Alternately, it may have a series of teeth with notches spaced apart closely enough so that suitable adjustment can be obtained. A carrying handle 45 may enclose one end of a support ring 46 having a rod 47 extending through an opening 48 through a lower, inturned portion 49 of the bar 40.Since people are not shaped in such a way that they will engage the actual vertex between the erected back member 12 and the seat member 11, this location of the hinge causes no problems of discomfort, and it affords a good location for the handle 45 when the unit 10 is carried. A back support assembly 50 comprises two spacedapart back support members 51 and 52, preferably generally vertically oriented and preferably elliptical in shape, connected by a central, vertically rigid and laterally flexing connecting member 53. Each of the back support members 51 and 52 may be identical to the other, but two different forms are shown inFig. 3. As illustrated, the member 51 has a wooden or chipboard block 54, which is rigid. The block s forward surface 55 has a slanting face portion 56, so that the block 54 is thinnest at its inner edge 57. Foam packing 58 provides a cushion and a cover 59, preferably like the covers 23 and 32, encloses the padding 58 and the forward and side portions of the block 54. As illustrated, the other back support member 52 has a flat, thin rigid metal plate 60, with padding 61 and a cover 62. The connecting member 53 is preferably of thin, strong metal so that while rigid vertically it is somewhat flexible laterally, having a spring like action tending to restore it to a central position and comprises a central portion 65 and two side portions 66 and 67 to which the block 54 and the plate 60 are respectively secured. The side portions 66 and 67 diverge from the central portion 65 at an angle, the angle preferably being about 150 See especially Fig. 3 .The edges of the covers 59 and 62 are preferably held, respectively, between the block 54 and portion 66, and between the plate 60 and the portion 67. In addition, the member 53 preferably comprises a forward central portion 68 welded to the portion 65, so that the portion 65 and 68 encompass all four sides of the bar 40. A lower portion 69 of the central portion 68 is wider than the rest and encloses most of a pair of latching devices 70 and 71. Each latching device 70 and 71 comprises a pivot pin 72 extending between the portions 65 and 68, a latch arm 73 mounted pivotally on the pin and having a locking tooth 74 for engagement in an opening 43 or 44.A spring 75 urges the latch arm 73 to normally closed position with its tooth 74 in an opening 43 and 44, while a lever portion 76 extends, preferably at an angle to the arm 73, beyond the lower edge 77 of the portion 69 so that it is accessible to the user, which grasps both lever portions 76 at once, disengaging both latch arms 73 at once by squeezing the lever portions 76 toward each other.Then he can slide the assembly 50 up or down to the proper height and by releasing the lever portion 76, enable the teeth 74 to engage openings 43 and 44 and hold the assembly 50 in place. Each user will probably wish to adjust the proper height of the pads 51 and 52 for his body. Moreover, some people find that it is often good to shift the pad height after one has sat for a long while. One s own feelings make it clear enough which way the shift should occur. This adjustment can be made while the sitter is occupying the insert 10, by moving momentarily away from the pads 51 and 52 and then manipulating the levers 76 behind him. When properly in place, the members 51 and 52 provide distributed support on eÅach side of the sacrolumbar region of the spine of the user The members 51 and 52, being separate, relieve the spine of all contact with the back and support the body on each side of the spine, distributing the supportive forces over the specific areas needing them. The cushioning portions 58 and 61 automatically accomodate to the shape of the user s back and provide proper and gentle distributed support to the lower back area. In combination with the semi rigid seat bottom 13 they help him to maintain optimum posture and thereby minimize the strain on him. Rearward pressure on and movement inward of one member 51 is transmitted through the connecting member 53 to generate a compensating forward pressure and outward movement of the other member 52, and vice versa by virtue of the twisting flexure of the bar 40. Thus, the assembly 50 adjusts itself to lateral and twisting movements of the user and, as a result, his precise position in the insert 10 is not critical to proper functioning of the insert 10.However, if the bar 40 were rigid, self adjustment of the assembly 50 would still occur due to the horizontal flexure of the connecting member 53, each member 51, 52 acting as a resilient cantilever.A modified form of unit 80 Figs. 6 and 7 A simplified and possibly less effective unit 80 is shown in Figs. 6 and 7 it is still quite good for its main purposes. To a seat portion 81 which may be like the seat 11 two vertical columns 82 and 83 are connected by hinges 84 and 85, enabling folding of the unit 80. The columns 82 and 83 have a series of openings 86 to which an assembly 90 may be bolted by bolts 87 at a desired height. A cross bar 88 at the upper end joins the columns 82 and 83, while a member 89 can serve as both a handle and, if desired, as a headrest. The back support assembly 90 comprises two elliptical members 91 and 92 joined by a connecting member 93, or isthmus. Operation is substantially as described before. To those skilled in the art to which thistinvention relates, many changes in construction and widely differing embodiments and applications of the invention will suggest themselves without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. The disclosures and the description herein are purely illustrative and are not intended to be in any sense limiting.
