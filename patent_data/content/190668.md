# A process for preparing ceramic bodies.

## Abstract
A process for the production of thin, flat, water impervious ceramic substrates which comprises slip casting a slurry of ceramic powder, wherein the ceramic powder in such slurry has at least 90 of its particles within a size range not broader than 0.3 microns and also 98 of its particles are less than 1 micron in size drying to give a greenware substrate and firing to give a coherent ceramic substrate.
