## Description
Means in transf err i ng pick up dataThe present invention concerns a means for transferring information from a pick up, said means comprising an electrical measuring pick up, such as a strain gauge assembly, a capacitor or equivalent, and electric power means by which power is supplied to the measuring circuit.It is known in prior art to transmit pick up infDrmation in wireless fashion. One example of a means known in the art is a means for measuring the torsion or the torque of a shaft, where a large collar is placed around the shaft. Within this collar is provided a source of d.c. electricity and a bridge circuit in which strain gauges measuring torsion or torque are incorporated as components.The equilibrium voltage Df said bridge circuit is carried to a modulator which controls a 10.7 MHz transmitting device. The system urthermore comprises a fixed means external to the sha t under measurement and comprising a coil antenna, receiver demodulator means and means for displaying or recording the measured data. The means of prior art, such as that just described, are complex in construction and therefore they cannot be used in every desired application.One of the applications of the present invention is a wireless pick up data transferring means, i.e., a telemetric means, by which it is possible to measure the temperatures, moments, pressures, stresses etc. present at various points for instance in a machine, such as a tractDr.The object of the present invention is to provide, for the applications discussed, a new means usable in pick up data transfer. A particular object of the invention is to provide a means of which the space requirements are small, so that the means is also usable in those applications where the use of means Df prior art has been inconvenient or outright impossible owing to their size. It is a particular object of the invention to provide a means in which the signal noise ratio can be made sufficiently highi where the number of components, as well as the power requirement, is small and which has minimal temperature dependence.In order to attain the aim presented above, and other aims which will become apparent later on, the invention is mainly characterized in that the signal obtained from the measuring circuit is supplied to a voltage requency converter to be its input signal that the output signal of said converter, its frequency dependent on the state of the pick up, is carried to antenna means and that said varying frequency is by wireless technique received with an antenna and with receiving, demodulating and detecting means.According to the invention is obtained a simple device which tolerates stress well and requires minimal space. For central component in the pick up data transfer means has been used a voltagefrequency converter, e.g. one of type AD 537. Around this central component have been disposed the other requisite blocks, which in actual fact only comprise the bridge circuit with its voltage supply and the antenna coil with matching transistors.In the hollowing, the invention is described in detail with refer ence to an embodiment example of the invention, presented in the figures of the attached drawing, but to the details of which the invention is not narrowly confined.Fig. 1 presents, in the form of a block diagram, the pick up transmitter means of the invention.Fig. 2 presents more closely the voltage requency converter unit applied in the inventionFig. 3 presents a mechanical application example of the means of the invention and its use in connection with a shaft constituting the object of measurement.The pick up transmitter means depicited in Fig. 1 comprises a voltage frequency converter 10 v f , to the input terminal 2 of which has been connected the bridge circuit II containing the pick up arrangement. The stabilized voltage supply of the bridge circuit 11 Is provided through an operation amplifier 12, which buffers the existing reference voltage UR derivable from the terminal 4 of the means 10. The branch Rb,Rv of the bridge 11 contains the pick up resistance Rv 18 or a pair of resistances, e.g. a strain gauge, a temperature dependent resistor, or equivalent. The error voltage UO reflecting the deviation of the bridge is ampli ied with a differential amplifier 13.The amplifier 13 may also be omitted if the unbalancing of the bridge 11 is powerful, and in that case it becones possible to control the current take up of the converter 10 directly. The amplifiers 12,13 are for instance of type LM 258.The power source, e.g. a miniature storage battery 20 t9 volts is connected over the switch K and the voltage regulator 12 to the terminal 8 of the converter 10. The frequency output 8 9 of the converter 10 has been connected over a matching transistor te.g. 2 N 3704 to the coil 15 serving as transmitter antenna. The transistor 14 has been connected to operate as an emitter follower.The band of long wave transmitting frequency out of the circuit ofFig. 1 is for instance between 50 and 150 kHz. The central frequency o of the converter 10 is selected with the aid of a capacitor C connected across its terminals 6 7 , and this capacitor must be of high enough quality.As shown in Fig. 3, the measuring system includes, in addition to the pick up transmitter means, a receiving antenna 22, a receiver modulator combination 23 and an indicator, printer or other recording means, such as a tape recorder.The operation of the means described is as follows. With the bridge circuit 11, the pick up datum Rv is converted into a voltage signal, which is amplified and conducted to the voltage frequency con verter 10, which converts the voltage signal into a radio frequency signal. It is thus understood that frequency modulation is applied.If or instance the commercially available micro circuit AD 537 is used for converter 10, the central frequency o may be calculated as follows, with the notations of Fig. 2 U. R1 rn , o 10 R1 R2 C The transistor 14 matches the frequency to be appropriate for the antenna 15. The antenna 15 is, as a rule, a small coil.In Fig. 3 has been shown a mechanical embodiment example of the pick up means of the invention. The pick up means has been disposed, for instance, around the power transmission shaft 25 of a tractor. In this application, too, the pick up means is required to consume little space, to draw little power and to present a good signal noise ratio. By means of the strain gauge 18, mounted in connection of the shaft 25 in a manner known in the art, is measured for instance the torque transferred by the shaft 25, on the basis of the torsion of this shaft 25.The pick up transmitter means 10 14 of the invention has been mounted on an electronic circuit board 16, and its components have been embedded in an insulating compound 17, e.g. in epoxy resin. To the circuit board 16 is carried the lead from the pick up 18 and the lead from the miniature storage battery 20. The miniature storage battery 20 is placed, with reference to the electronic circuit board 16, on the opposite side of the shaft 25 in a holder 19, in conjunction with the latter being further provided a voltage regulator 12, from which a lead 21 departs to the circuit board 16. With a pIacement of components as in Fig. 3, the measuring means does not cause any harmful mechanical unbalancing of the shaft 25.The simplest way to mount the parts 17, 19 and 20 shown In Fig. 3 in conjunction with the shaft 25 is to wind these parts with tape.If the means is meant to be a permanent pick up transmitter means in conjunction with the shaft 25, it is possible to dispose the means in a special housing, the parts of this housing being fixed e.g. by their marginal flanges to each other and around the shaft 25. The switch K may be arranged to be remote controlled or to operate e.g. by centrifugal force so that it will only be closed when the shaft is rotating, or when otherwise needed.The antenna coil 15 is fixed in conjunction with the shaft 25 that is being studied. The antenna coil 15 emits into its surroundings a long wave electromagnetic radiation, the frequency fout of which is in the range from 50 to 150 kHz mentioned above. The radiation is received with the antenna 22 ardwith receiver demodulator means 23 placed in the vicinity, and it is detected and if required recorded with means 24, in which the acting signal is dependent in a known manner on the resistance of the pick up resistor Rv.It is possible to connect a known resistance across and or in series with the pick up resistance Rv, and in Its conjunction a switch, whereby a given artificial deviation from equilibrium of the bridge 11 is effected. This deviation is used to calibrate the system and to check that the measuring system operates properly. This calibration resistance has not been depicted in Fig. 1.The means just described may be used e.g. for measuring the torque transmitted by the loaded shaft 25 of a tractor e.g. between the gear box and the clutch, or its vibrations, either in product development work or as a pick up means incorporated in the tractor and joined to the tractor s electronic control system, or to a load indicating means in the tractor cab, for instance an indicating instrument or a lamp array.In the following are stated the claims, various details of the invention being allowed to vary within the scope of the inventive idea thereby defined.
