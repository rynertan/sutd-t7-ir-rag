# Stylus shielding and unshielding apparatus for a phonograph.

## Abstract
The upwardly extending reproducing stylus 100 is shielded within opening 24 in phonograph 16 when recorded message carrier 12 is not in playing position by a cover member 246 . A cam 256 unshields stylus 100 and exposes it in an arcuate slot 244 when a pin 274 on recorded message carrier 12 exerts a downward force on cam 256 during the coupling of carrier 12 to opening 24 by engaging annular grooves 290 with detents 44, 46, 48 .
