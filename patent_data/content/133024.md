# Improved process for forming thermally stable thermotropic liquid crystalline polyesters of predetermined chain length.

## Abstract
An improved polymerisation process is provided for the formation of a polyester which is capable of forming an anisotropic melt phase and which optionally may include amide linkages. An approximately 0.4 to 3 percent molar excess of aromatic dicarboxylic acid monomer e.g. tereph thalic acid and or an esterified derivative thereof is provided in the polymerisation zone during the polymerisation reac tion. Such monomer imparts dicarboxyaryl units to the interior of the resulting polymer chains and causes the polymer chains to terminate in carboxylic acid end groups and or an esterified derivative thereof wherein the polymer chains achieve a predetermined average chain length through the depletion of other monomers present in the polymerisa tion zone. The resulting polyester unlike the usual product of the prior art is substantially incapable of additional chain growth upon subsequent heating and accordingly may be relied upon to maintain a substantially constant viscosity dur ing melt processing regardless of the duration of heating.
