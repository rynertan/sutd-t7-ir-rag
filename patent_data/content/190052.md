## Description
Title of the Invention Lighting fixture hanging unit. Background of the Invention a Field of the invention This contrivance relates to a unit for hanging lighting fixture called the unit in the following text to support lighting fixtures and also as the electrical wiring. b Prior art As shown in Fig. 4, unit A of this kind is made of a pair of conducting wires 1 2 fixed to the upper and lower insulating supports 3 4 with spacing between the wires and of the hooks la, lb, 2a, 2b formed at both ends of the wires 1 2 . To compose a decorative lighting fixture by using this kind of unit, the upper hooks la, 2a of the wires 1, 2 are hung from the fittings 5, 6 projected from the ceiling as shown in Fig. 5 for example, and the upper hooks la, 2a of the wires 1, 2 of another unit A are hung from the lower hooks lb, 2b of the first unit, then the required number of units A are suspended in the same manner in order. The wires 7, 8 of the lighting fixture B such as the lamp are hooked from the specified points of the pair of wires 1, 2 of each unit A.With lighting fixture of this kind, the hooks 5, 6 , the wires 1, 2 . of the unit A, and the wires 7, 8 of the lighting fixture are electrically connected, and there is no need to perform connection of the lighting fixtureB or support and the electrical wiring separately at the time of installation. As an advantage, the work for connection or support can complete the electrical wiring work at the same time.In many cases, however, length of the pair of wires 1, 2 ofeunit A is different, the length L2 of one wire 2 may somewhat shorter than the length L1 of the other wire 1 as shown in Fig. 4 for example.In such a case, malcontact between the wires 1, 2 of each unit A, A tends to happen when two or more units are suspended as shown in Fig. 5.With unit A of conventional type, however, the wires 1, 2 are fixed to the supports 3, 4 , and the difference in the length of the wires is not absorbed, which causes said malcontact frequently. Summary of the InventionIt is therefore an object of this invention to provide an unit having a function to absorb difference in the length of a pair of wires, thereby overcoming the abovediscussed disadvantage of the prior art.In order to accomplish the foregoing object, the unit by this invention is provided with an elastic and expandable bent in the middle of the wires and the wires are held by the supports so as to slide freely.By this composition, difference in the length of the wires due to dispersion of the pair of wire, can be absorbed effectively because the wires are expanded at the bend by the weight of another unit suspended from the unit making the shorter wire to the equal length as the longer wire.Accordingly, possibility of said malcontact is eliminated.Other objects and advantages of this invention will become apparent in the course of following description together with the accompanying drawings. Brief Description of the DrawingsIn this drawings forming a part of this application, and in which like parts are designated reference numerals throughout the same,Fig. 1 is a perspective view of a unit by an embodiment of the invention Fig. 2 is an assembly and exploded view showing the essential parts of the wires and the support Fig. 3 is a front view of unit by another embodiment Fig. 4 is a front view of a conventional unlit, andFig. 5 is a front view showing an example of lighting fixture. Description of the Preferred EmbodimentReferring now to the accompanying drawings an embodiment of this invention is described in detail hereinafter.By the unit A shown in Fig. 1 for example, a pair of conductive wires 1, 2 are held at two places by the insulating supports 3, 4 with spacing between the wires.These supports 3, 4 are made of a pair of split members synthetic resin molds for example 31, 41 combined together as shown in the drawing, for example.The split members 41 of the lower support 4 has anL groove 42 to accept the wires as shown in Fig. 2.The groove width at the horizontal part 42a of thisL groove 42 is set larger than the outside diameter of the wire housed in the L groove 42 , the wire 2 for example, so that the wire 2 housed in the L groove 42 can slide up and down within certain range.The other wire 1 is also held by the support 4 so as to slide freely.The pair of wires 1, 2 are also held by the upper support 3 so as to slide freely.The upper support 3 is provided with a stopper not illustrated to prevent dropping of the wires 1, 2 .The pair of wires 1, 2 are bent in the middle as is evident from Fig. 1, and the bent parts are positioned symetrically. The wires 1, 2 are also provided with a dent 12, 22 onto which the lighting fixture is hooked. See Fig. 5. By said unit A, the bent parts 11, 21 can expand freely against elasticity of the wires 1, 2 , and expansion of the wires 1, 2 is allowed by slide displacement of the wires 1, 2 in the L groove 42 provided on the support 4 . Even if the pair of wires 1, 2 differ in length, the shorter wire is expanded to the same length as the longer wire by the weight of another unit suspended from the hooks lb, 2b of the wires 1, 2 .Accordingly, the linked units in suspended condition are free from any malcontact between the wires. Fig. 3 shows another embodiment. In this embodiment, the bents 11, 21 of the wires 1, 2 are formed in arc shape. The lower support 4 forms the fitting parts 43a, 43b to the projected bends 13, 23 made on the wires 1, 2 . With such a unit A and even if the wire 2 is shorter than the wire 1 , the bent 21 of the wire 2 is expanded to the same length as the wire 1 , as shown by an imaginery line in the drawing, when another unit is suspended from the hooks ab, 2b of the wires 1, 2 and the hook 2b is set at the same height as the hood lb . No malcontact, therefore, is caused. The bents of the wires can be in shape as illustrated, or in arc shape or any other shape. When shaped to arcform, however, expansion of the bents against elasticity of the wires is better.It is further understood by those skilled in the art that the foregoing description is รก preferred embodiment of the disclosed device and that various changes and modifications may be made in the invention without departing from the spirit and scope thereof.
