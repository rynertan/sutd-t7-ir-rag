# Recording apparatus.

## Abstract
A recording apparatus for linewise recording informa tion on a moving photoreceptor by means of a plurality of chips 35 on each of which parallel sub rows 26,27,28,29 of uniformly spaced radiation sources are formed, wherein a shortcoming of prior art apparatus, namely the impossibility to use chips on which even one radiation source only is defect, is overcome. The apparatus comprises two parallel rows 44,45 of radiation sources 11 , each row comprising reserve radia tion sources that are arranged with corresponding basic radiation sources of the other group in optical parallelism, and connection circuit means for establishing electrical contact with a basic and or a reserve radiation source.
