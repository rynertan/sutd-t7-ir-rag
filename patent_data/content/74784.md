# Improvements relating to latch security devices.

## Abstract
A security kit is provided for securing a latch comprising a lock casing 7 and a staple 8 against tampering by the insertion of a flexible strip to spring the lock. The kit comprises templates 1 and 2 which are positioned against the lock casing 7 and the staple 8 by means of location arrows 3 and carry markings 4 to indicate the positions of headed studs which are driven into the door 5 and door jamb 6 . The templates 1 and 2 can be formed together as a single unit and can additionally provide mountings for the headed studs and or spacer washers used to ensure that the whole of a gap will be filled.
