# Apparatus for transcribing digital data.

## Abstract
For recording digital words on magnetic tape without developing a net D.C. charge that would cause base line shift by use of a scheme of mapping of the words into code patterns from a larger number of bits and preselecting patterns which either have no D.C. weight or have a D.C. weight of 4 or 8 and in the latter two cases, providing alternate patterns for such words both with opposite sense to be used alternately to contract any charge buildup, the patterns also being selected to avoid frequency doubling.
