# EXCLUDER DEVICE FOR TELEPHONES INSTALLED IN PARALLEL

## Abstract
Excluder device for telephones installed in parallel, characterised in that it basically consists of a combination of a full wave bridge rectifier 1 with a relay circuit, made up of a zener diode 2 and a current divider consisting of two resistors 3, 4 the relay circuit being associated with a thyristor 5 , whose anode is connected to the cathode of the zener diode and to the positive of the rectifier 1 , whilst the cathode is connected to earth and the switch to the current divider, and in that an independent resistor is incorporated, able to cause a voltage drop equivalent to that which deter mines the rest of the telephone system.
