# An apparatus and method for separating particulate solids from a mixed phase solids gas stream.

## Abstract
This invention relates to an apparatus and method for rapidly separating particulate solids from a mixed phase solids gas stream which may be at velocities up to 150 ft. sec. and at hight temperature. Specifically, the device is designed for incorporation at the discharge of solid gas reacting systems having low residence time requirements and carried out in tubular type reactors 13 . Separation is effected by projecting solids by centrifugal force against a bed of solids as the gas phase makes a 180 directional change 15 , said solids changing direction only 90 re lative to the incoming stream 14 .
