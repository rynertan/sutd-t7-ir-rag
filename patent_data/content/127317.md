# Solar cell.

## Abstract
A solar cell which includes a thin layer of active material 12 bounded on the side toward the incident light with an antireflection coating 14 and bounded on the other side by a two dimensional reflecting diffraction grating 16 to inter nally reflect the incident light back into the active material 12 . The grating 16 forms a hexagonal array of cylindrical protru sions 28 or depressions 30 such that the distance D between the cross sectional centres of any two adjacent prot rusions 28 or depressions 30 is substantially the same.
