## Abstract
A method of, and apparatus for, terminating a conductor of a flat flexible cable. A flat flexible cable C is inserted into a U shaped terminal 4 having a resiliently deflectable arm 46 . A camming element 16 is then inserted into the terminal 4 to urge the cable C against a contact surface 57 of the deflectable arm 46 , the cable C having been previously stripped of insulation on its side adjacent to the contact surface 57 . The deflectable arm 46 is first elastically deflected by the action of the camming element 16 and is thereafter plastically deflected thereby. The camming element 16 is so dimensioned, and the resistance of the flexible arm 46 to its plastic deflection in relation to its resistance to its elastic deflection are such that, the final contact force exerted against the cable conductor is independent for practical purposes, of the stripped thickness of the cable C , such thickness not exceeding 0.4mm.
