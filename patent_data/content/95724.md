# SWITCHING CIRCUIT

## Abstract
A switching regulator includes a switching transistor for converting a d.c. input to an a.c. voltage, a d.c. reproducing cir cuit for converting the resulting a.c. voltage to a d.c. voltage, a drive transistor provided between the base of the switching transistor and the output of the d.c. reproducing circuit. The drive transistor thus arranged causes a drive current to flow through the switching transistor and adds the drive cur rent to the reproducing d.c. output in order to improve the tranducing efficiency.
