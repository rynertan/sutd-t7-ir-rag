# REFRIGERATION METHOD AND APPARATUS

## Abstract
In a mechanical refrigeration apparatus of the vapour compression kind, comprising a compressor 2, condenser 4, expansion valve 6, and evaporator 8, a sub cooler 12 is em ployed to reduce the temperature of the condensed re frigerant to a value at which at least 90 by volume and pre ferably all of it remains in the liquid phase on passage through the expansion valve 6. The sub cooler 12 is cooled by means of a supply of liquid nitrogen from vessel 14. Alternatively, liquid nitrogen is evaporated in a circulating heat exchange atmosphere in the sub cooler 12. Increased heat load in chamber 10 may thus be met without there necessarily being any increase in the evaporating temperature and pressure.
