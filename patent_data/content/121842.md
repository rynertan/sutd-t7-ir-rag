# Improved pump control arrangement for automatic automotive transmission or the like.

## Abstract
In order to prevent excessive pump output drain off and to ensure that the hydraulic pressure supplied to a control chamber C C of a variable capacity pump 0 P of a hydrauli cally control system is maintained at an appropriate level with respect to the control pressure line pressure being utilized in the control system, a pressure limiting valve 36 is disposed between a drain port 102f of a pressure regulating valve 2 and the torque converter T C which operatively intercon nects the prime mover engine with the transmission. This pressure limiting valve 36 includes a spool 236 which is bi ased in a direction to reduce the pressure passed there through to the torque converter T C by the pressure prevail ing in a feedback chamber which communicates with the con duiting 450 between the valve 36 and the torque converter T C .
