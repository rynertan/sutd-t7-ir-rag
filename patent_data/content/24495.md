# Acoustic pulse delay line system for measuring distances along a magnetostrictive wire.

## Abstract
A magnetostrictive wire 10 is provided at one end thereof with a pulse sensor 161 having an appropriate set Barker sequence of coils connected in series which are adapted to pick up an encoded train of magnetoacoustic sign als. A position signaling electromagnetic drive head 141 is moved along the wire 10 to any desired position. The head 141 is pulsed to produce the encoded sequence of acoustic pulses in the wire 10 . When those pulses are received by the sensor 161 , a large pulse is produced at one time position of the waves as they pass through its sequence of coils. This large signal is used in conjunction with a timer 26 19 to provide position measurement. A second pulse sensor 162 makes it possible for a microprocessor 210 to provide self calibration against thermal drifts in accuracy as well as immediate warning of invalid readings.
