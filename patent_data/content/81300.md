# Synchronized mixing pump.

## Abstract
A mixing pump includes a primary pumping chamber 12 opposed by a secondary mixing chamber 15 with primary and secondary pistons 14,16 that are connected to each other and reciprocated in the chamber 12,15 . An actuator mechanism 20 that drives the pistons 14,16 is located between the chambers. An additive fluid is expelled from the secondary chamber 15 through a mixing conduit 50 into a mixing chamber 48 where it is injected into a main fluid. The fluid mixture from the mixing chamber 48 is admitted to the primary pumping chamber 12 from which it is expelled under pressure through an outlet valve 49 in the primary piston 14 . The fluid is thoroughly mixed as it passes through that valve 49 and coaxial annular passages 56,57 surrounding this piston 14 .
