# Reprogrammable array logic systems.

## Abstract
A described dynamically reprogrammable logic array system includes an AND array 1 and an OR array 2 having an output register 3 at the output of the OR array. Commands stored in a load directory 9 specify subarrays within an array for repersonalization, an addressable loca tion in load storage 10 containing the personality to be loaded into the subarrays. The load commands stored in the load directory are selectable by logic array output R r , by chaining or externally.
