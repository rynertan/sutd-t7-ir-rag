# Adaptive echo suppressor and method.

## Abstract
An adaptive echo suppressor for a sub band speech coder communications system analyzes and uses the N contiguous sub bands of the speech coder. An estimate of the echo return loss R for each sub band is calculated in an R Estimate circuit 5 as the ratio of the modulator energy M to the demodulator energy D. Expected echo level esti mates E are calculated in an echo level estimate circuit 6 as the product RxD. A switching decision logic 7 compares the modulator energy M against the expected echo level estimate E and controls the interruption switch 9 and the path attenuator 8 , based upon whether the individual sub band energy at the modulator 3 exceeds or not the expect ed echo level estimate E for that sub band.
