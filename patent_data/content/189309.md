## Description
The present invention relates to a semiconductor device and a method of producing same, in particular semiconductor device comprising a single crystalline silicon substrate provided with single crystalline films of oxides such as Al₂O₃, MgO and MgO.Al₂O₃ laminated thereon and a method of producing same by Molecular Beam Epitaxy. Semiconductor device comprising a single crystalline silicon substrate provided with interlayer insulating films and silicon layers being alternatively laminated thereon and a circuit structure being incorporated therein have been developed. Metal oxides such as Al₂O₃, MgO and MgO Al₂O₃ have been used as the interlayer insulating films of such a semiconductor device, but these interlayer insulating films have been formed on the silicon substrate and each silicon layer usually by CVD Chemical Vapor Deposition in the form of single crystal, poly crystal or amorphous substance. However, high temperatures at about 1,000 In respect of such a problem in CVD, the formation of the above described interlayer insulating films of oxide by MBE Molecular Beam Epitaxy , in which thin films can be formed at lower temperatures such as 700 The formation of insulating films of oxides such as MgO Al₂O₃ by MBE is reported by, for example, R. A. Stall in p. 135 137, J. Vac. Sci. Technol., B1 2 , Apr. June 1983 , that is to say Growth of refractory oxide film using solid oxygen sources in a molecular beam epitaxy apparatus is reported. Reference should also be made to EP A 010735 which describes a method of fabricating an oxide film R A certain extent of result is reported on the formation of films not on a Si substrate but on a GaAs substrate. It is, however, the actual state that the formation of oxides such as MgO Al₂O₃ to be laminated on a silicon layer in the form of poly crystalline oxide film, or single crystalline oxide film as in above mentioned semiconductor device of multi layer structure has never been achieved. In addition, a problem has occurred in that also a MgO Al₂O₃ film must be single crystalline in case that a single crystalline silicon layer is further laminated on the insulating film of MgO Al₂O₃ and the like formed on a single crystalline silicon substrate. That is to say, when elements are formed in poly crystalline or amorphous silicon layer, they do not exhibit the reproductivity as an electronic circuit since a poly crystalline or amorphous layer cannot reproduce identical characteristics, circuits having identical characteristics cannot be obtained even though elements having identical circuit patterns are formed in them and also electric characteristics become nonuniform thereby electronic characteristics of electronic circuit as designed cannot be obtained. Accordingly, a method, in which a silicon layer grown on an insulating film is once melted by a laser beam and the like and then recrystallized to obtain a single crystalline layer, has been tried. However, this method has the problems in that the crystal seed in recrystallization must be only one in order to obtain a single crystal and accordingly, the temperature distribution must be controlled and the crystal must be grown only in the appointed direction from the seed. It is a first object of the present invention to provide a semiconductor device comprising a single crystalline substrate provided with an insulating film of oxides formed thereon by MBE and a method of producing same. It is a second object of the present invention to provide a method of producing a semiconductor device, in which the thermal shock to a silicon substrate and elements formed therein can be prevented when insulating film is formed on a single crystalline substrate, and the semiconductor device produced by said method. It is a third object of the present invention to provide a method of producing a semiconductor device, in which a single crystalline insulating film of oxides can be formed on a single crystalline silicon substrate by the molecular beam epitaxy MBE technique and the semiconductor device produced by this method. The invention consists in a method of producing a semiconductor device, in which an oxide film formed by oxidizing metal atoms with one or more group V metal oxides as an oxygen source is grown on a single crystalline silicon substrate by the Molecular Beam Epitaxy MBE technique, said oxide film being composed of a material selected from the group consisting of MgO Al₂O₃, MgO and Al₂O₃, characterised in that 1 the temperature of said single crystalline silicon substrate is set within the range of from 700 C to 900 C, said temperature being in the range of from 800 C to 900 C for an oxide film of MgO Al₂O₃ from 700 C to 900 C for an oxide film of MgO and 750 C to 900 C for an oxide film of Al₂O₃, 2 the ratio of the number of oxygen atoms to the number of metal atoms of the oxide film is set in the range of from 2 1 to 4 1, and 3 the crystal growth speed is set in the range of from 0.1µm hour to 2.0µm hour, whereby said oxide film is grown in a single crystalline form. In a preferred embodiment, layers of the oxide film and layers of the silicon substrate material are alternately laminated onto the silicon substrate to form a three dimensional circuit structure in which all of the layers are of a single crystalline form. The above and further objects and features of the invention will be more fully apparent from the following detailed description with reference to the accompanying drawings. Referring now to FIG. 1 which is a sectional view showing a construction of a semiconductor device according to the present invention, interlayer insulating films 6a, 6b ... and silicon layers 7a, 7b ... are alternatively laminated on a single crystalline silicon substrate 5 to form a three dimensional circuit structure, that is to say, an interlayer insulating film 6a, which is an oxide film, is laminated on the single crystalline silicon substrate 5, a silicon layer 7a being laminated on the interlayer insulating film 6a, an interlayer insulating film 6b being laminated on the silicon layer 7a, a silicon layer 7b being laminated on the interlayer insulating film 6b ..... The interlayer insulating film 6a laminated on the single crystalline silicon substrate 5 and the interlayer insulating films 6b ... arranged thereover are formed as single crystalline layers and also each of the silicon layers 7a, 7b ... is formed as a single crystalline layer. FIG. 2 is a schematic side sectional view of an MBE apparatus for carrying out a method of producing a semiconductor device according to the present invention and FIG. 3 is a schematic drawing showing the reactions making progress when MgO Al₂O₃ magnesia spinel is deposited on a single crystalline silicon substrate 5. Referring to FIGS. 2, 3, referring numeral 1 designates an ultra high vacuum vessel and 2 designates a cryoshroud disposed in the ultra high vacuum vessel 1 and filled with liquid nitrogen. A sample heating plate 3 provided therein with a heater not shown is installed within a space surrounded by the cryoshroud 2 and the single crystalline silicon substrate 5 is fixedly mounted on the surface of the sample heating plate 3, concretely its surface being opposite to effusing cells 4a, 4b, 4c which are described later. The effusing cells 4a, 4b, 4c aim at supplying molecules of Al, Mg, and Sb₂O₃ respectively, and pass through the cryoshroud 2 so as to direct the front ends thereof toward the single crystalline silicon substrate 5 fixedly mounted on the sample heating plate 3, respectively. Al is housed in the effusing cell 4a, Mg in the effusing cell 4b, and the group V oxides as an oxygen source, for example Sb₂O₃ also As₂O₃ and the like can be used , in the effusing cell 4c. These effusing cells 4a, 4b, 4c are constructed so that upon heating at the appointed temperatures, molecules of substances housed therein may be directed from the front ends thereof toward the silicon substrate 5 at the appointed speeds. The silicon substrate 5 is heated at the appointed temperature. In case where Al molecules and Sb₂O₃ molecules are supplied into the cryoshroud 2, the reaction expressed by the following equation 1 makes progress thereby forming a single crystalline, poly crystalline or amorphous layer of Al₂O₃ which is an insulating oxide film, and gradually making the layer grow The formation of other insulating oxide films of MgO, MgO Al₂O₃ or the like is fundamentally similar. That is to say, the reactions expressed by the following equation 2 and 3 make progress by supplying Mg molecules and Sb₂O₃ molecules or Mg molecules, Al molecules and Sb₂O₃ molecules, respectively, thereby forming a single crystalline, poly crystalline or amorphous layer and gradually making the formed layer grow FIG. 3 shows the reaction process expressed by the above described equation 3 . It is suitable that oxide films to be formed as the insulating films 6a, 6b ... are formed of the above described MgO Al₂O₃ magnesia spinel , Al₂O₃, MgO or the like. The reason is that crystal forms of the oxide films are cubic being identical with that of a single silicon crystal of the substrate, and the formers are similar to the latter in lattice constant thereby the oxide films are easy to epitaxially grow. Though Al₂O₃ usually having a hexagonal crystal form, γ type one has a cubic crystal form in a stabilized range of 900 Although Sb₂O₃ is used as an oxygen source in the present invention, the oxygen source is not limited to the use of Sb₂O₃. As disclosed in the above described report by R. A. Stall, also other group V oxides can be used. The reason why the group V oxides are preferably used as an oxygen source is that the group V elements, above all Sb, have a lower sticking coefficient thereby their linkage with oxygens is easy to cancel, and they are difficult to link with Si atoms constructing the silicon substrate 5. In other words, the reason why the group V oxides, above all an oxide of Sb for example Sb₂O₃ , are used as an oxygen source is that not only the vacuum condition within the ultra high vacuum vessel 1 is hardly dropped but also impurities can be prevented from depositing to the silicon substrate 5. Still, it is unsuitable to use oxygen itself as an oxygen source since the vacuum condition within the ultra high vacuum vessel 1 is dropped. On the other hand, it is almost uniquely determined by the growing conditions whether insulating oxide films are formed in the form of a single crystalline, a poly crystalline or an amorphous layer on the silicon substrate 5. The present inventor found it from various kinds of experiments that the conditions as shown in the following Tables 1, 2 are required for growing oxide films, such as Al₂O₃, MgO and MgO Al₂O₃, on the silicon substrate 5 in the form of single crystalline layer by MBE In the following Tables 1, 2 the conditions required for forming single crystalline oxide films on a 100 plane of the single crystalline silicon substrate are shown. Among the above described conditions, the especially important conditions for obtaining single crystalline oxide films are 1 the substrate temperature, 2 the ratio of atom numbers, 3 the film growth speed and the like. And, as far as these three conditions and other incidental conditions are satisfied, the oxide film, which can be deemed as an almost single crystalline layer, can be laminated on a single crystalline silicon substrate, even though a slight quantity of poly crystalline portion is contained in the single crystalline layer. Each of these conditions will be below described. In case where a substrate temperature, that is a temperature of a surface, on which an insulating oxide film 6a is formed, of a silicon substrate 5 is a certain extent of temperature or more, molecules of an oxide film substance, such as Al₂O₃, have the momentum of high level thereby not depositing to the surface of the silicon substrate 5. On the other hand, in case where the substrate temperature is a certain extent of temperature or less, plenty of molecules are deposited thereby growing a poly crystalline layer. In case where the substrate temperature is further lower, an amorphous layer is formed. Also in MBE, as same as in CVD, there is the possibility that a silicon substrate is damaged by the thermal shock, so it is necessary that the substrate temperature is a certain temperature, concretely about 900 On the basis of the above described premise, the substrate temperature of 750 Similarly, as to MgO, a single crystalline film is formed at the substrate temperature of 700 Further, as to MgO Al₂O₃, a single crystalline film is formed at the substrate temperature of 800 RHEED Reflection High Energy Electron Diffraction patterns as shown in FIGS. 4 1 to 3 show the differences in crystallinity depending upon the above described substrate temperatures. Concretely speaking, this is a case where the crystals of MgO Al₂O₃ are grown on a single crystalline silicon substrate with Sb₂O₃ as an oxygen source. A temperature of an Al cell 4a in FIG. 2 was held constant at 1,100 FIG. 4 1 shows the results of the growth of MgO Al₂O₃ in the case where a temperature of the single crystalline silicon substrate is held at 800 FIG. 4 2 shows the results of the same in the case where a temperature of the single crystalline silicon substrate is held at 700 In addition, FIG. 4 3 shows the results of the same in case where a temperature of the substrate is held at 500 RHEED patterns as shown in FIGS. 5 1 to 3 show the differences in crystallinity in case where the crystals of MgO Al₂O₃ are grown on a single crystalline silicon substrate with As₂O₃ as an oxygen source. Excepting that a pressure of As₂O₃ was 3.7 x 10 ⁶ Pa 2.8 x 10 ⁸ Torr constant, the conditions were same as in case where Sb₂O₃ was used as an oxygen source. Accordingly, at the substrate temperature 800 Although it is a matter of course that the crystallinity is different depending upon the kinds of substances of oxide films to be formed on a single crystalline silicon substrate, as described above, a single crystalline layer is obtained at the substrate temperature of 900 It has been concluded that the ratios of a number of metal atoms, such as Al, Mg and Al Mg, which construct molecules of the substances of oxide films, to an oxygen atom are preferably 2 to 4 regardless of the kinds of the substances of oxide films. An amorphous oxide film is formed in case where a ratio of a number of oxygen atoms to a number of metal atoms is less than 2, and one or some bonds of a metal atom are not linked with oxygen atoms, so that the formed oxide film becomes short of oxygen, thereby optical and electronic characteristics are deteriorated. On the contrary, in the case where a ratio of a number of oxygen atoms to a number of metal atoms exceeds 4, a poly crystalline film is formed or the crystal is insufficiently grown, and further, oxygen atoms act upon Si atoms of a silicon substrate faster than upon metal atoms to form an amorphous SiO₂ film in some cases. An insulating film is no longer grown on this amorphous SiO₂ film in an epitaxial manner. FIG. 6 1 to 3 show the relations between pressures of Sb₂O₃ and the crystallinity of the formed oxide film of MgO Al₂O₃ grown on a single crystalline silicon substrate at the constant substrate temperature of 800 FIG. 6 1 shows a RHEED pattern of a MgO Al₂O₃ film formed in case where a pressure of Sb₂O₃ is high to an extent of 1.3 x 10 ⁵ Pa 1 x 10 ⁷ Torr , in other words a ratio of a number of oxygen atoms to a number of metal atoms is large. A ringed pattern proving a poly crystalline structure was obtained. FIG. 6 2 shows a RHEED pattern of a MgO Al₂O₃ film formed in case where a pressure of Sb₂O₃ is 3.3 x 10 ⁶ Pa 2.5 x 10 ⁸ Torr the optimum condition , in other words a ratio of a number of oxygen atoms to a number of metal atoms is 2 to 4. A streaked pattern proving a single crystalline structure was obtained. FIG. 6 3 shows a RHEED pattern of a MgO Al₂O₃ film formed in case where a pressure of Sb₂O₃ is low to an extent of 1.3 x 10 ⁶ Pa 1.0 x 10 ⁸ Torr , in other words a ratio of a number of oxygen atoms to a number of metal atoms is small. A hollow pattern proving an amorphous structure was obtained. FIGS. 7 1 to 3 show RHEED patterns of MgO Al₂O₃ grown on a single crystalline silicon substrate similarly to the above described with As₂O₃ as an oxygen source. Similarly to the above described, a substrate temperature was 800 As described above, in case where a ratio of a number of oxygen atoms to a number of metal atoms constructing a molecule of an oxide film is 2 to 4 in dependence upon an oxygen source, a single crystalline oxide film of metals such as Al, Mg and Al Mg can be formed on a single crystalline silicon substrate. Every oxide film of Al₂O₃, MgO and MgO Al₂O₃ was formed at a film growth speed of 0.1 to 2.0 µm hour. The crystals are difficult to grow at a film growth speed of 0.1 µm hour or less, and poly crystals are formed at a film growth speed of 2.0 µm hour or more. The reason of the above described is that new molecules deposit to a crystal before the crystal grows in the form of a single crystal, thereby forming a poly crystal in case where the film growth speed exceeds 2.0 µm hour. In addition, the Al cell temperature and the Mg cell temperature as shown in Table 1 determine the number of Al atoms and Mg atoms supplied from the effusing cells 4a, 4b, respectively. On the other hand, the pressure of Sb₂O₃ as shown in Table 1 is determined by the temperature of the effusing cell 4c and determines the number of oxygen atoms to be supplied. Accordingly, although such a relation that the ratio of the number of oxygen atoms to the number of metal atoms may be 2 to 4 so as to obtain a single crystalline film exists between these numerical values, fundamentally at first a pressure of Sb₂O₃ is set at 2.7 x 10 ⁶, 2.7 x 10 ⁵ and 3.3 x 10 ⁶ Pa, 2.0 x 10 ⁸, 2.0 x 10 ⁷ and 2.5 x 10 ⁸ Torr for Al₂O₃, MgO and MgO Al₂O₃, respectively, on the basis of a vacuum condition within a ultra high vacuum vessel 1 and then a temperature of each of the effusing cells 4a, 4b and 4c is determined so that a ratio of a number of oxygen atoms to a number of metal atoms may be 2 to 4 in dependence upon the pressure of Sb₂O₃. Generally speaking, it is necessary only to set temperatures of substrate at 750
