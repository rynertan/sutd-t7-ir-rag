# Apparatus for controlling delay times at the time of a changed speed reproduction mode.

## Abstract
A delay time control apparatus comprises a comparing circuit 60 for comparing levels of reproduced frequency modulated signals from a pair of rotary heads which simultaneously scan over a magnetic tape, where the rotary heads have gaps of mutually different azimuth angles, a head selecting circuit 48 responsive to an output signal of the comparing circuit, for selectively producing the repro duced signal from the rotary head having a larger level, a signal processing circuit 53 57 for obtaining a reproduced video signal from the reproduced signal which is selectively produced from the head selecting circuit, a variable delay circuit 77 for delaying the reproduced video signal from the signal processing circuit by a delay time, and a delay control signal generating circuit 72 for variably controlling the delay time of the variable delay circuit so that the variable delay produces a reproduced video signal in which repro duced horizontal synchronizing signals have a constant period.
