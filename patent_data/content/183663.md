# Sensor for measurement of the deflection and or torsion of an oblong machine element.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a sensor 10 for measurement of the deflection of a machine element 17 . The sensor comprises a detecting portion 11 , a light source 24 , a light detector 26 and connected guides 20,25,27 . An electronic data processing unit 28 is connected to the sensor. The detecting portion comprises a tuft 13 of optical fibres, a focusing lens 14 fitted into a tube 12 , and a mirror 15 separated from the tube 12 . The deflection of the machine element 17 caused by the work piece 23 results in an inclination of the mirror 15 relative to the center line of the tube, and therefore a light beam from the light source 24 coming into an optical fiber in the tuft is reflected in the mirror towards a point on the end of the fiber tuft which is arranged at a distance from said center line. This reflected light is transferred to the light detector 26 for transmission of an analogous signal to the electronic unit 28 in which the value of the deflection is determined.
