# Procedure for splicing yarns.

## Abstract
This invention concerns a procedure for splicing yarns, whether textile or otherwise, with a joint made by coupling two single untwisted yarns 20 21 and thereafter retwisting them, characterized by the fact that the single yarns 20 21 are untwisted b beyond a substantially nil twist value b and are then coupled c and retwisted so as to impart to the single yarns 20 21 a desired twist d at least almost the same as the twist comprised in the original yarn Figure 9b , whereby the untwisting phase b is carried on beyond the nil value b1 until a minus W negative twist value has been imparted which is equal to at least 15 20 of the initial X twist value comprised in the single yarn 20 21 , and whereby the value of the negative twist minus W is at least in proportion to the desired reciprocal thrust induced between the yarns at least in the transitory phase d2 when the fibres are parallel to the axis of the single coupled yarns 20 21 during retwisting. The invention also concerns a splice made with said procedure.
