## Description
PHOTOSENSITIVE STENCIL MATERIALS This invention relates to photosensitive stencil materials for use in screen process printing and particularly concerns precoated stencil film materials and their methods of use. In screen printing, the printed image required is defined by a negative of the image carried upon a screen printing cloth, which is usually in the form of a woven polyester or steel fabric. The invention provides improved methods and materials for producing screen printing stencils photographically and offers advantages both in production and use of such stencils, when compared with any of the four methods commonly used. These known techniques can be characterized as the direct, indirect, direct indirect and capillary methods and are described briefly below The invention may be termed a pressure bonded method and is described in detail further below. In the direct coating method, photostencils are produced by coating a light sensitive composition, known as a direct emulsion, directly upon the stencil screen and, after drying, exposing the coated screen through a photographic positive. The exposed photostencil is then developed by washing away the un exposed areas in water, leaving the insoluble exposed areas in the form of a negative image which adheres firmly to the screen, the mesh being encapsulated by the emulsion during the coating process. Direct emulsions are usually composed of mixtures of polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetate, post sensitised with a dichromate salt or a water soluble diazo resin, these emulsions cannot be supplied in a pre sensitised form, due to shelf life considerations.Some pre sensitised direct emulsions based on alternative photochemistry are known, which eliminate the need to sensitise the emulsions before use. The main advantage of stencils produced by the direct coating method is their durability, while their use can also be comparatively economical, depending upon the materials and the details of the production methods employed. Their main disadvantages are inconsistency in thickness and difficulty in eliminating the mesh pattern from the edges of printed images. Unless considerable time and care are taken in the coating step, direct photostencils are unsuitable for applications where high resolution, absence of edge defects and close ink deposit control are important. A variation of the direct coating method is also known, in which the positive is laminated to the screen with a photosensitive emulsion or lacquer during the coating operation, such as is described in GB A 2002531.However, this method has not found wide commercial use, because of inherent disadvantages, such as contamination of photographic positives and exposure equipment by the liquid photopolymer and difficulty in removing stencils from the screen fabric after use. In comparison with the direct method, the other known methods for producing screen photostencils employ precoated film materials and generally provide greater consistency, better ink deposit control and higher potential image quality. In the indirect method, a sub coated transparent plastics support, usually polyester film, carries a pre sensitised polymer layer. For instance, coatings based upon polyvinyl alcohol sensitised with a monomer photoinitiator are described in GB A 1307995. In use, a photographic positive is placed between a light source and the polyester support, so that exposure of the photosensitve coating is made through the transparent support. The unexposed areas remain soluble in the developer, which is usually water, so that the resultant negative resist image of the original remains attached to the polyester support. In order to prepare for printing, a moistened screen is contacted with the stencil, which is then dried and the film or other support is peeled away. The indirect method is particularly suitable for high resolution printing, where good definition is important and where close ink deposit control must be maintained. However, indirect stencil materials lack durability, due to the relatively weak bond between the stencil and the screen mesh, caused by hardening of the coating before it comes into contact with the mesh. The need for photostencil systems which combine the durability of those made by the direct method with the reproducibility and image quality of those made by the indirect method led to the development of the socalled direct indirect stencil system, such as described in US A 3532052. A dry coating of a non photo sensitive resist layer on a support sheet is laminated with the printing surface of a screen using a photo sensitive emulsion, which encapsulates the mesh and so firmly attaches the coating, still carried on its support, to the screen. After drying, the support sheet is peeled away, leaving a flat even printing surface of constant and reproducible thickness on the screen. These stencils have the advantages mentioned, but their main disadvantages are the complex processing involved in their use and the need for sensitising by the user.With most direct indirect coated materials, the sensitiser migrates into the film material from the laminating emulsion. The amount of emulsion used for the laminating stage and the drying time are two of a number of variables governing the amount and distribution of sensitiser in the coated film. Even if procedures are carefully standardised, climatic conditions and variations in operator technique are additional factors which adversely affect the reproducibility of stencils. In the production of highquality durable thick stencils, the direct indirect method and materials have enjoyed considerable commercial success, even though existing materials involve tedious processing and give variable results, particularly when the slower migrating diazo resin sensitisers are used in conjunction with coatings of more than 25tri thickness. Capillary film materials use a presensitised dry resist coating, which is prepared by attachment to a printing screen using water, drying the coating, removing the carrier film and exposing in conjunction with a master positive. As there is no sensitising step and no need to handle chemicals or apply an emulsion coating, much of the tedious processing of the direct indirect system is eliminated and capillary stencil methods and materials provide the best available combination of image quality, durability and reproducibility. The versatility of the capillary method is also high, as films are available in a wide range of coating thicknesses to suit a wide variety of mesh counts, and capillary materials also are available which are resistant to water based inks, as well as those resistant to conventional solvent based inks. At present, however, separate films must be used for these two applications. In order to illustrate the state of the art in stencil production, the processing steps involved in the use of a capillary product, Capillex 35 Regd. Trade Mark of AutotypeInternational Ltd are described below this product is a precisioncoated diazo resin sensitised polyvinyl alcohol polyvinyl acetate emulsion, containing minor proportions of additives the dry coating has a thickness of 33 36 and its support is 75p guage biaxially oriented polyester film.Preparation of Stencil attached to a Polyester FabricScreen 1 The screen is first thoroughly cleaned, so that the mesh fabric can hold a uniform film of water without showing signs of repellancy 2 The Capillex 35 film is unrolled and cut to size under light safe conditions, namely in an area substantially free from ultra violet, blue or green light this is conveniently achieved by operating under yellow fluorescent illumination, with the elimination of sunlight 3 The film is rolled around a tube, with the emulsion side out, its leading edge is contacted with the top of the wet screen and the rest of the film is then unrolled across and in contact with the screen as the emulsion is partly dissolved and sucked into the mesh by capillary action, the coating becomes firmly attached 4 The screen is then dried, preferably in a warm air stream, and the backing film is then peeled away 5 The screen is then exposed to a photographic positive in a vacuum printing frame for the required period of time usually 2 10 mins, depending on the power and type of light source and its distance from the frame 6 After exposure, the stencil is washed with water to dissolve unhardened unexposed emulsion, leaving firmly adhered to the mesh a negative image of the photographic positive 7 The stencil is then dried and any open areas of mesh surrounding the image are blocked out with a screen filler the stencil is then ready to be mounted on a press for printing. These seven steps just described show readily that stencil preparation even using the convenient capillary method is still relatively time consuming and tedious, despite the fact that this method is the fastest and most reliable way at present to prepare durable high quality printing resists. Moreover, the capillary technique, in common with direct emulsions, indirect films and direct indirect films, does not allow the production of stencil resists which are suitable for all types of printing ink. Most stencil materials have good resistance to the organic solvents typically used in screen printing inks, e.g. aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, alcohols, esters and ketones, but do not have good resistance to water containing inks mixtures of organic solvents and water are particularly damaging to conventional stencil materials.An exception to this is given by those photostencils which derive their solvent and water resistance from post hardening treatments, such as baking or lacquering these stencils are very durable but their use is normally confined to textile printing operations, as the curing operation is specialised and time consuming and, moreover, these stencils cannot be removed from the mesh after use, giving the serious disadvantage that the expensive screen cloth cannot be re used. There is thus a distinct need for a new type of screen photostencil material, which is quicker, simpler and more versatile than those employed in the known methods briefly described above and which yields stencils suitable for use with solvent based, solvent water based and water based inks. It is an object of this invention to fulfil this need. According to the present invention, a photosensitive stencil material is provided, which is in the form of a multi layer product which is characterised by comprising a transparent plastics film support carrying at least two superposed light hardenable layers and a cover sheet upon the light hardenable layer furthest from the support, wherein the light hardenable layer in contact with the cover sheet is at least sufficient in thickness to embed at least partially an applied screen printing mesh, when in use, and is more soft and tacky than the underlying light hardenable layer nearer the film support, which is relatively harder, substantially non deformable and non tacky. The substantially non deformable and non tacky layer serves in use to provide a flat printing surface at the interface between the stencil and the substrate to be printed and ensures that this flat surface is obtained mainly by limiting reception of the screen printing mesh to the more soft and tacky layer,which is exposed when the cover sheet is removed and the screen is brought into contact with the multilayer stencil material of the invention. This therefore provides even, i.e. uniform, reproducible ink deposits and sharply defined printed images. It has been found that provision of the substantially non deformable layer ensures that printed images of good quality can be obtained over a range of mesh counts.It has also been found that the products needed for an alternative system, having a single pressure sensitive layer of a photocurable composition on a support, are difficult to store and handle, because they have a tendency toward edge seepage and coating deformation. According to a preferred feature of the stencil material of the inventionttwo relatively hard substantially non deformable and non tacky layers are provided between the film support and the light hardenable layer which is in contact with the cover sheet, either or both of such relatively hard, substantially non deformable and nontacky layers comprising a light hardenable composition. Preferably, the plastics film support comprises a material selected from polyesters, polyvinyl chloride, polycarbonates and polystyrene. According to another preferred feature of the invention, the light hardenable layer in contact with the cover sheet comprises polyvinyl pyrrolidone, pentaerythritol triacrylate while the underlying light hardenable layer comprises polyvinyl alcohol. In order that the invention may be readily understood, three embodiments are described below, by way of example only, in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Fig.1 shows diagrammatically, in section, a first embodiment of a multilayer stencil material according to the invention Fig. 2 shows another embodiment of the invention, again diagrammatically and in section Fig. 3 shows a further embodiment of the invention, also diagrammatically and in section. Referring to Fig 1, a transparent plastics film support 1 is coated on one side with a layer 2 of a flexible, but not easily deformable, light hardenable composition. This layer 2 has over it a second coating layer 3, which consists of a soft relatively deformable photo sensitive and adhesive composition. The layer 2 is therefore also light hardenable and additionally is relatively harder than the layer 3 and also is substantially non deformable. In terms of their softness and tackiness, the layer 3 is more soft and more tacky than the layer 2, which is comparatively non tacky.Finally, a release or cover sheet 4, 5 is laminated on to the otherwise exposed surface of the pressure sensitive photocurable adhesive layer 3. This cover sheet 4,5 consists of a paper or plastics film layer 5 coated with a release layer 4, the release layer 4 being the component in contact with the adhesive layer 3. The stencil material thus comprises the support 1, the two light hardenable layers 2 and 3 and the cover sheet 4,5. Referring to Fig.2,this shows an embodiment in which the film support 1, the relatively soft and tacky photohardenable layer 3, the release layer 4 and the paper film layer 5, the two latter comprising the peelable cover sheet 4,5, are essentially the same as in the embodiment of Fig.1. Two separate relatively hard and non tacky layers 2a and 2b, either or both of which may be a photocurable composition, underlie the photocurable layer 3. The layer 2a may be a photosensitive or non photosensitive sub coat. The transparent plastics film support 1, in any form of the stencil material of the invention, can be any of several suitable film materials, such as polyesters, polyvinyl chloride, polycarbonates and polystyrene. The film support 1 is preferably a material which is substantially transparent to light in the wavelength band of 350 450 nm, because photo initiators used in photohardenable layers are activated by light in this spectral region. Preferably, the transparent film support 1 has a thickness in the range from 0.2 x 10 mm to 1.3 x 10 1mum 20 130 . It has been found that thinner supports are usually less than satisfactory, because they often give rise to handling difficulties, while thicker supports may cause loss of resolution during exposure.The cover sheet 4,5 may be a plastics film or paper 5, treated to prevent it adhering too firmly to the pressure sensitive photopolymerisable layer 3, by application d the release coating 4. The thickness of the various photohardenable layers, such as the layers 2, 2a and 2b or 3 in the embodiments of Figs. 1 and 2, can be varied over wide limits. In fact, it is an advantage to vary the thickness of the layers, that is to provide a range of materials in which these layers are of different thicknesses, in order to adapt the stencils better for specific printing applications. The relatively soft adhesive photohardenable layer 3 may have its thickness regulated so as to make the resultant product more suitable for adhering to very coarse, coarse, medium, fine and very fine meshes, respectively. Generally, very coarse meshes are taken to be those having a thread count below 30 threads cm coarse meshes have 30 60 threads cm medium meshes have 60 110 threads cm and fine meshes have 110 165 threads cms. Any mesh having more than 165 threads cm can be classified as very fine.Preferably, the stencil materials of the invention are made so that the light hardenable layer in contact with the cover sheet has a thickness equal to at least half the cross sectional thickness of a selected one of the five categories of stencil screen printing meshes represented by 1 very coarse 5 to 2.5 x 10 mm 500 to 250A coarse 2.5 to 1 x 10 1mm 250 to 100 medium 10 to 6 x 10 2mum 100 to 60 fine very fine 8 to 5 x 10 2 whereby the stencil material can be used with screen printing meshes of the selected category and finer categories. The dimensions given for the various categories are the thread thicknesses corresponding to the respective thread counts. In order to adhere the laminated screen stencil materials of this invention to the screen mesh, it is necessary partially to encapsulate the mesh with the soft adhesive photohardenable layer 3 of the product, which is exposed when the cover sheet 4,5 has been removed.Complete encapsulation is not necessary, but to ensure good adhesion of the stencil material to the mesh during printing, it has been found, as a general rule, that the mesh should be embedded to at least half its cross sectional thickness,so as to ensure optimal adhesion. It will be understood from the foregoing that it is possible to vary considerably the thickness of the soft adhesive layer 3, so as to enable the stencil material to be optimised for use with the various categories of meshes described.Alternatively, a single product can be formulated and made, which is capable of encapsulating all classes of mesh, but, when such a product is used with medium and fine meshes, it is usually necessary to protect the vacuum blanket of the printing down frame, during exposure, from contamination by the soft tacky photohardenable layer 3, which flows around the back of the screen threads under vacuum pressure.A further disadvantage of providing and of using one product for all categories of meshes is represented by the prolonged exposure times which are needed to photoharden very thick adhesive layers, which is an unnecessary inconvenience if medium or fine meshes are being used.In practice, a product with a photohardenable adhesive layer of approximately 5 to 6 x 10 mum 50 60 works well with medium, fine and very fine meshes for coarser meshes the products are preferably made with adhesive layers which are progressively increased in thickness as necessary, to ensure sufficient mesh encapsulation for good stencil adhesion to be obtained. The flexible, but non deformable layer 2, in Fig. 1, or layers 2a, 2b in Fig.2, may also have its or their thickness varied between wide limits. By varying the thickness of the photohardenable non deformable layer 2 or 2a, 2b, the relief or height of the stencil protruding from the mesh can be varied. Since the tacky photohardenable layer 3 embeds the mesh, the flat printing surface, necessary to ensure that lateral ink flow under the stencil edges does not occur, is provided by the photohardenable non deformable layer 2 or 2a, 2b, which sits proud of the mesh. Fig. 3 shows a schematic cross sectional view of a monofilament screen mesh with a photohardened and developed stencil adhered to it.The layer 6 of the stencil represents the flexible non deformable component which constitutes the printing surface and the layer 7 is the photohardened adhesive layer into which the mesh 9 is embedded. The height of the layer 6 above the mesh 9 can be varied between a few microns and several hundred microns. The thickness of the layer 6 has a direct influence on the amount of ink or other screen printable substance deposited when the distance, 8, representing a typical stencil opening, is not greater than about 3 mm. For some screenprinting applications, it is necessary to limit the ink deposit as much as possible, in which case the thickness of the layer 6 is preferably not greater than 1 x 10 mum 10ss as is normally the case in commercial half tone colour printing. For other applications, such as the printing of solder masks during printed circuit board manufacture, the layer 6 can advantageously be 3 5 x 10 2mum 30 50A in thickness in the printing of solder pastes in thick film circuit board production, 1 the layer 6 can advantageously be 1 5 x 10 mm 100 500A in thickness. The laminated photosensitive multilayer stencil materials of the invention are used to prepare printing screens as follows A sheet of the laminated screen stencil film material of the appropriate size, which is somewhat smaller than the printing area of the screen mesh, but larger than the photographic positive to be exposed, is taken. One of its top corners is adhered to the mesh by peeling away the protective cover sheet and pressing the exposed part of the soft and tacky coating lightly into the mesh. The screen should be dry, but does not need to be specially prepared or cleaned. New virgin screen mesh may be used without any special pretreatment or degreasing procedure. The protective cover sheet is then stripped away and the stencil film material is smoothed into contact with the screen mesh by hand. At this stage, the stencil film is not firmly adhered. If a printing down frame equipped with a flexible rubber blanket is used to carry out the exposure to the photographic positive, then the pressure generated in the frame is sufficient to push the adhesive layer into the screen mesh and hence firmly adhere the stencil. If a vacuum frame is not used, then the stencil film can be adhered by ironing the stencil on to the mesh with a warm iron 500 1200C . If the stencil is ironed from the inside of the screen frame squeegee side , then the release coated cover sheet 4,5 should be placed on the mesh, so as to prevent any direct contact between the iron and the adhesive coating. Exposure is advantageously carried out using a mercury halide, mercury vapour or carbon arc light source, the time varying with the radiation flux incident on the stencil, which in turn is a function of light intensity and distance. Exposure times similar to and faster than conventional screen stencil materials are readily obtained. After exposure, the plastics backing sheet or film support is stripped off the exposed stencil.It is possible to formulate the photohardenable coatings so that, on stripping off the backing sheet, unexposed areas of the stencil are stripped away from the screen mesh simultaneously, thereby enabling a dry developed stencil to be provided. Alternatively, the backing sheet can be stripped away leaving all of the coating still adhered to the mesh and the unexposed areas are then washed away with water. Whichever method is preferred, the resultant stencil can be water proof and solventresistant and can be used to print a wide variety of solvent based and water based screen inks. The photostencil materials of the invention can be readily formulated so as not to be sensitive to normal diffuse daylight and white light from fluorescent tubes, yet can have very short exposure times using the standard light sources used with photoresist coatings.This enables screens to be prepared without the need to work in safelight conditions, which all conventional screen stencil materials require. This is a significant advantage for small printing shops which do not have sufficient space to provide segregated stencil production areas. In summary, the screen stencil materials of the invention offer significant advantages over all of the four classes of conventional materials described above.Their ability to adhere to dry screens, without the necessity for degreasing and roughening the mesh, substantially speeds up screen make ready times. Their ability to adhere by vacuum contact or a quick smoothing with a warm iron eliminates the tedious mounting and drying procedures required when using conventional direct, direct indirect and capillary stencil materials.The possibility of providing self developing materials by peeling out unexposed areas with the backing sheet is a very significant advance in ease of handling and speed of stencil production. Materials according to the invention which are developed with water can be dried simply by wiping with an absorbent cloth, due to the robust and resilient nature of the stencils produced, thus substantially eliminating the post development drying procedure required by all the main categories of photo stencil materials of the prior art. Moreover, the stencils produced using the invention can readily be formulated to be both water resistant and solventresistant, which once again is not normally the case for conventional stencil materials. In order that the invention may be readily understood, some practical Examples of photosensitive multi layer stencil materials embodying the invention are described below, by way of illustration only.

Example 1 describes a range of products which illustrate the effect on adhesion ofa variation in thickness of the soft and tacky photohardenable layer 3, while Example 2 describes a range of products which illustrate the effect on stencil relief on the screen mesh of a variation in the thickness of the relatively hard and non deformable layer 2.EXAMPLE 1 a Substantially non deformable layer 2 W WPolyvinyl alcohol Gohsenol KH 20 i 3.30 80 hydrolysed Polystyrene 50 aqueous dispersion Vinamul 7700 ii 4.20Polystyrene 55 aqueous dispersion Vinamul 8440 ii 8.20Acrylated polyurethane 55 aqueous dispersion Laromer PE55W iii 32.80Isopropylthioxanthone 0.60Ethyl paradimethylaminobenzoate 2.40Water 47.90Aqueous dispersion of dioxazine pigment Unisperse Violet BE iv 0.60 The polyvinyl alcohol is dissolved in the water with heating, under the action of a high shear stirrer.

The mix is then allowed to cool to 30 C. The other ingredients are then added and the mix is slowly stirred until it is again completely homogeneous. A coating of component a followed by a coating of component b were applied, using wire wound rods see Table 1, to a transparent film support, such as that shown at 1 in Fig.1, comprising a 5 x 10 mm thick Melinex polyester film I.C.I. Drying of the coating was carried out using 400C warm air. The resultant series of coated films were then laminated to 72 g m2 kraft paper polythene coated on one side and silicone treated on the polythene side, serving as the release coated cover sheet 4 5 in Figs.1 and 2 . The range of stencil film materials so manufactured were then used, by being applied to screen printing meshes by the technique described above, by peeling away the silicone coated release backing paper 4 5 and applying the exposed soft and tacky layer 3 to the mesh fabric. With the aid of smooth hard pressure, the film materials were adhered by thus causing the layers 3 to penetrate the mesh. Photographic exposure of the films was accomplished using a 3 kW Nu Arc Fliptop unit with a mercury halide lamp. A vacuum frame held the photographic positive in contact with the polyester support 1 . The siliconised backing sheet 4 5 removed in applying the films to the screens can be used to prevent any tackiness at the back of the mesh from spoiling the vacuum blanket. After exposure, the screen is removed from the exposure unit and the backing sheet 4 5 is removed if still adhering. The polyester support 1 is peeled away from the surface of the film and the film is washed thoroughly with cold or warm water, until all unexposed areas of the stencil film are removed. The finished stencil film may then be dried with either a warm fan or by wiping with a cloth prior to use.
