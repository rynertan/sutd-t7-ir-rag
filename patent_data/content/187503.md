# SHARED LINE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM

## Abstract
A small low cost local area network for use within an electronic sybsystem for allowing communication between distributed processors is described. The processors are coupled through a single shared line, and the higher priority processor is allowed to secure the line in case of contention. All contending processors are forced to start transmission at the same time by waiting a predetermined delay time since the last received pulse before starting transmission. Every processor first transmits its own number, the transmissions are ORed on the shared line, and every processor compares its transmitted signal against the signal on the line. The processor transmitting a low will not sense the collision and will continue, but the processor transmitting a high will sense the collision and back off. Thus, the processor with the lower number will have a higher priority. Priority can also be established by having the lower priority processor wait a longer time since the last received pulse before transmitting.
