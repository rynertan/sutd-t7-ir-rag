# System for selecting word lines in a bipolar RAM.

## Abstract
A system for driving a bipolar RAM, comprising a first means for changing the potentials of word lines re sponsive to the selected state and the non selected state thereof, the potential of one selected word line being higher than those of the other non selected word lines, and a second means for changing the potentials of the non selected word lines responsive to the read mode and the write mode thereof, the potentials of the non selected word lines being lower during the read mode than during the write mode.
