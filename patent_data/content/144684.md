# Forming Patterns in metallic or ceramic substrates.

## Abstract
A method for forming a pattern in a metallic and or ceramic substrate by laminating together the substrate which is in the green stage and a composite of a photosensi tive material and a backing wherein the photosensitive material has been developed into the desired pattern, and then subjecting the substrate to elevated temperatures in order to cause sintering of the substrate and removal of the photosensitive material, thereby resulting in embedding of the pattern into the sintered substrate. More specifically the method comprises forming a pattern of conductors the width or separation of which is less than 2 mils, by the following steps a providing a composite of a layer of photosensitive material on a backing b exposing said layer of photosensitive material to actinic radiation in a predetermined pattern c developing said layer of photosensitive material to leave the predetermined pattern on said backing d then laminating together said composite and a substrate in the green stage containing metallic particles or ceramic particles or combinations thereof with the de veloped photosensitive side of the composite confronting the surface of said substrate and e subjecting the substrate to elevated temperature sufficient to cause sintering of the particles in said substrate and removal of the photosensitive material, thereby result ing in embedding the said pattern into the sintered metallic or ceramic substate.
