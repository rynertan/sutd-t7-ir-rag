# Vaccine prepared employing platinum compounds.

## Abstract
Vaccine is prepared by inactivation of non enveloped virus with cis diamino chelated platinous halide in presence of an effective amount of a detergent. The method of inactivation is particularly applicable in employing a non ionic detergent in inactivating a double stranded RNA virus. Viruses which are treated in this way include the virus of bluetongue disease.
