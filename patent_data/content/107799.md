## Description
DURABLE PRESS RESIN COMPOSITIONS The present invention relates to campositions for treating textile materials and more particularly to durable press resin compositions for treating textile materials and to a process for treating textile materials to impart durable press finishes thereto. Background of the Invention Thermosetting durable press resins, also known as aminoplast resins have been used to treat textile materials to impart durable press properties and dimensional stability characteristics to the treated textile materials. These durable press resins, such as methylolated ureas or methylolated urea based derivatives which are obtained from the reaction of formaldehyde and urea or urea based derivatives generally contain from 95.8 to 97.8 weight percent of aminoplast resin and from 4.17 to 2.2 weight percent of formaldehyde. Textile materials finished with durable press resins generally release formaldehyde due to the hydrolysis of unreacted methylol groups. The release of formaldehyde causes unpleasant odors and is a suspected health hazard. Therefore, it is pre ferred that textile materials finished with durable press resins be free of formaldehyde or at least have very low levels of formaldehyde. Aminoplast resins have been developed which are free of formaldehyde and me thylol groups however, they do not impart satisfactory durable press properties to textile materials treated therewith. Surprisingly, it has been found that textile materials treated with an aninocl2st resin and an aldehyde provides a durable Dress resin finish at substantially lower add on levels with desirable properties. The resultant textile material releases low levels of formaldehyde, has satisfactory durable press properties and exhibits dimensional stability. Therefore, it is an object of this invention to provide durable press resin compositions for treating textile materials. Another object of this invention is to provide durable press finishes which impart softening and durable.press properties. to textile materials. A further object of this invention is to provide a textile material having low formaldehyde levels, a soft hand, durable press properties and dimensional stability characteristics. Summary of the invention. The foregoing1 objects and others which will become apparent from the following description are accomplished in accordance with this invention, generally speaking, by providing a durable press resint compos itxon containing 1 from 0.25 to 45 percent by weight of an aminoplast resin, 2 from 0.03 to 37 percent by weight of an aldehyde, and 3 from to 99.72 percent by weight of a diluent based on the weight of the durable press resin composition. The durable press resin composition is combined with an acid catalyst and applied to textile materials to impart durable press and dimensional stability properties thereto. In addition to providing improved durable press properties and dimensional stability characteristics, the treated textile materials have a low level of formaldehyde and a soft hand.

Organopolysiloxanes containing silicon bonded hydrogen may be represented by the general formulaEMI7.3 in which R10 is as defined above, e has a value of from 1.0 to 2.5, f has a value of from 0.005 to 2.0 and the sum of e f is equal to from 1.005 to 3.0. The organopolysiloxane containing silicon bonded hydrogen may also be copolymers containing at least one unit per molecule of the formulaEMI8.1 with the remaining siloxane units of the organopolysiloxane having the average formulaEMI8.2 where R10 and e are the same as above, e has a value of from 0 to 2, f has a value of from 1 to 2, and the sum of e f is equal to from 1,0 to 3.0.

The organopolysiloxanes containing silicon bonded aliphatically unsaturated groups may be represented by the formulaEMI8.5 where R10, e and f are the same as above and R12 represents a silicon bonded aliphatically unsaturated group such as a vinyl or allyl radical. These organopolysiloxanes containing aliphatically unsaturated groups may also be copolymers having siloxane units of the formulaEMI8.6 where R10, R12, e , f and the sum of e f are the same as above. Generally, the copolymers contain from 0.5 to 99.5 mole percent of units having the formulaEMI9.1 and from 0.5 to 99.5 mole percent of units having the formulaEMI9.2 where R10, R12, e, e and f are the same as above. Any catalyst capable of promoting the addition of silicon bonded hydrogen to silicon bonded aliphatically unsaturated groups may be used in preparing these softeners. Preferably, the catalyst is platinum or a platinum compound or complex. The silicone softeners may also contain organofunctional groups. Examples of such softeners are copolymers of aminofunctional polysiloxanes containing units of the formula NH2 R13 NH13 g SiO1.5 and units of the formulaEMI9.3 wherein R10 and e are the same as above, R13 which may be the same or different is a divalent hydrocarbon radical having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms and g 0, 1, or 2.

Other organofunctional silicone softeners which may be included in the compositions of this invention are the silylated polyethers described in U. S. Patents Nos. 4,312,993 and 4,331,797 to Martin which are incorporated herein by re erence. Also, compositions containing silanol terminated polyorganosiloxanes and the silylated polyethers described inU. S. Patents Nos. 4,312,993 and 4,331,797 to Martin can be used as softeners in the compositions of this invention. Another class of silicone softeners which may be included in the durable press compositions of this invention are those desc ribed in U. S. Patent No. 4,184,004 to Pines, which is incorporated herein by reference. These softeners consist of organosilicone terpolymers containing a plurality of reactive epoxy groups and a plurality of polyoxyalkylene groups. These organosilicone terpolymers may be prepared by the platinum catalyzed addition of an ethylenically unsaturated epoxy compound and an ethylenically unsaturated polyoxyalkylene organic radical free of olefinic unsaturation, preferably an alkyl compound, to hydrosiloxanes. Organic softening agents may also be used in the durable press resin compositions of this invention in the presence or absence of the above silicone softeners. Suitable examples of organic softeriers are fatty amides, fatty acid amines, and fattyacid amido amines amido amines with mono and diglycerides, qua ternized ethoxylated fatty acid amines, hydroxyethy Idi ethyl ammonium sulfate and stearic quaternary ammonium compounds fatty acid esters such as stearates, glycerol stearates, diethylene glycol stearates, and sulfonated fatty acid esters of polyethylene glycols and diethylene glycols oxyalkylene polymers such as oxyethylene polymers, oxypropylene polymers, and copolymers thereof, salts of long chain alcohols and fatty alcohol EattE acid amide blends fatty acids such as lauric, myristic, palmitic oleic, and stearic acids diethylene dipropyl benzoates poly ethylene,oolymers and sodium hydrocarbon sulfates. The softening agent may be added directly to the durable press resin composition, or they may be emulsified or dissolved in water or organic solvents and then added to the resin composition. When the softening agent is added to the durable press resin composition, i.e., an aminoplast resin, aldehyde and diluent, it is preferred that it be present in an amount such that the resultant finishing bath used for treating textile materials will contain up to about 8 parts by weight of softening agent. The softening agent may be dissolved in aliphatic alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, butanol, hexanol and octanol. The durable press resin compositions of this invention, may be prepared by mixing the aminoplast resin, aldehyde and diluent in any order and at temperatures ranging from about 100C to 900C. The durable press resin composition may be applied to any textile materials. Examples of suitable textile materials are cotton, rayon, polyester, polypropylene, polyethylene, polyurethane, polyamide, wool, hemp, natural silk, cellulose acetate and polyacrylonitrile fibers as well as mixtures of these fibers. The textile materials may consist of staple or monofilament fibers and fabrics made thereof. The durable press resin compositions of this invention may be applied the textile materials by any means known in the art, such as by spraying, immersion, foaming, padding, calendering or by gliding the fibers across a base which has been saturated with the compositions of this invention. A preferred method for treating textile materials is to use a finishing bath containing a solution, dispersion or emulsion of the durable press resin compositions of this invention. The finishing bath composition contains the durable press resin composition, acid catalyst and softener, if desired.Also, the finishing bath composition may be further diluted with a diluent. It is preferred that the diluent be the same diluent or at least a diluent which is compatible with the diluent used in the durable press resin composition. Preferably the diluent is water or an aliphatic alcohol having from I to 8 carbon atoms. The finishing bath preferably contains from 0.1 to about 99 parts by weight, and more preferably from about 5 to 50 parts by weight of durable press resin composition and from about 0.5 to 20 parts by weight, and more preferably from about 1 to 10 parts by weight of acid catalyst. The amount of diluent added to the finishing bath may range from 0 to 99.4 parts by weight and more preferably from about 10 to 75 parts by weight and the amount of softening agent, when present, may range from about 0 to about 8 parts by weight and more preferably from about 1 to 5 parts by weight When the durable press.resin compositions are used in the form of an emulsion, any of the known surfactants can be used as emulsifying agents, including the anionic, cationic, nonionic and amphoteric surfactants. Suitable examples of acid catalvsts which may be used in the compositions of this invention are water soluble metal salts such as magnesium chloride, magnesium nitrate, magnesium sulfate, magnesium dihydrogenphosphate, zinc nitrate, zinc chloride, zinc tetrafluoroborate, aluminum chlorohydrate, aluminum chloride and mixtures of two of the above salts water soluble ammonium and amine salts such as ammonium chloride, ammonium sulfate, aminomethylpropanol hydrochloride and aminomethylpropanol nitrate ammonium and amine salts in combination with the metal salts described above acids such as oxalic acid, gluconic acid, phosphoric acid, tartaric acid, maleic acid, ptoluenesulfonic acid and acetic.acid and combinations of the above acids with the above described.metal salts. The aminoplast resin component and the water soluble acid catalyst component should be kept separate until ready for use due to the instability of the mixture. The other components of this invention may be combined together in any order. It is, however, preferred that the other components be added to the aminoplast resin component. The amount of the durable press resin composition of this invention which is applied to the textile material depends on the desired properties of the treated material. Generally, it is preferred that the textile material be treated with from 0.1 to 25 percent by weight of durable press resin composition, and more preferably from 0.2 to 20 percent by weight of the durable press resin composition, based on the weight of the textile material The textile material finished with the composition of this invention is heated at an elevated temperature, e.g., from 800 to 200 C for a brief period of time e.g., from 20 seconds to 15 minutes.Alternatively, the treated textile material can be dried below the above temperature range, e.g., from 50 to 950C for a brief period of time, e g., from 1 to 10 minutes, and then cured at an elevated temperature, e.g., from 225 to 200 C for an even briefer period of time, e.g., 15 to 60 seconds. Textile materials treated with the durable press resin compositions of this invention exhibit all properties common to textile materials treated heretofore with aminoplast resins. In addition, when the levels of.aminoplast resin are reduced in conventional systems, in order to lower the formaldehyde levels on the fabric, poor durable press properties and dimensional stability characteristics are observed. However, in the present invention, the addition of aldehydes permit a reduction of the aminoplast resin component of from 57 to 95 percent without adversely increasing the amount of formaldehyde present on the textile material after treatment, and without affecting the durable press properties and dimensional stability characteristics. The addition of softener to the durable press resin compositions of this invention does not alter the durable press properties and dimensional stability characteristics of the fabric nor formaldehyde levels on the textile material. Textile materials treated with the durable press resin softener compositions of this invention have a softer hand than those treated with the durable press resin compositions alone or with other conventional aminoplast resins. Furthermore, because the amount of aminoplast resin component required in the present invention to obtain durable press properties is significantly less than that required heretofore, the durable press finish is significantly more economical. Other substances which may be incorporated in the composition of this invention are agents which improve abrasion resistance of the treated fibers, materials which improve the fragrance of the treated textile materials, antistatic agents, lubricants, fire retardant agents, soil resistant materials, other hydrophilic, oleophilic, or hydrophobic agents and soil release materials such as those described in U. S. Patents Nos.3,595,141 and 3,377,249 to Marco. Specific embodiments of this invention are further illustrated in the following examples in which all parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise specified. The amount of formaldehyde present on the treated textile materials is determined in accordance with the procedure described in theTechnical manual of the American Association Of Textile ChemistsAnd Colorists AATCC Test o. 112 1978 . The dimensional stability and durable press ratings are determined in accordance with AATCC test method number 135 1978 and 124 1978, respectively.Example 1 Several compositions are prepared by dispersing the ingredients shown in Table I in water. The compositions are padded onto samples of polyester cotton 65 35 fabric at 50 percent wet pick up. The fabric is dried for 60 seconds at 1200C and cured for 20 seconds at 2040C The treated fabric is then evaluated for a parts per million formaldehyde b dimensional stability through five home launderings c durable press properties through five home launderings. The results show that formaldehyde enhances the durable press ratings and dimensional stability of the fabric through multiple home launderings. Furthermore, the treated fabric contained less than 200 ppm parts per million formaldehyde. Generally, the textile industry requires 500 ppm or less.
