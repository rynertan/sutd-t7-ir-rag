# Roller, vane or like rotary pump.

## Abstract
The cam surface of a roller type positive displacement pump providing an inlet port 14 and two outlet ports 15, 16 has on circumferentially opposite sides of at least one of the outlet ports 15, 16 a profile such that the difference between the squares of the radii R₁, R₂, R₃ at the instan taneous points of contact therewith of the two rollers 12a, 12d, 12e, 12f which serve to seal the port at said opposite sides is a constant. The portions 17, 18, 19 of the cam surface at opposite sides of such an outlet port may each for example have a part circular profile centred on the axis of rotation 20 of the rotor.
