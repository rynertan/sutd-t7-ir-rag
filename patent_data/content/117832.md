# Vehicle multiplex system having protocol format for secure communication transactions.

## Abstract
An improved serial data protocol format is provided in a serial multiplex system for use in an automotive vehicle electrical system which is subject to electrical noise. The protocol format includes successive transactions between a master controller and respective remote controllers each connected to a serial multiplex bus. Each transaction is bi directional and includes a command message transmitted by the master controller and a reply message normally trans mitted by an answering remote controller. Each command message is preceded by a multibit SYNC byte. The command message includes an address byte for a particular remote controller , a command byte, and an error check such as a cyclic redundance check byte passed on the address and command bytes. The reply message includes the address byte of the replying remote controller, a response byte in dicative of its response to the command byte, and an error check such as a cyclic redundancy check byte based on the reply address and response bytes. The master controller may be caused to repeat the transmission of a command message if the address bytes, the command response cor relations or error check bytes are not verifiable, thereby en hancing the system s ability to detect and or reject errors as might be occasioned by noise.
