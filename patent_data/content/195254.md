# METHOD FOR BEHAVIOR MODIFICATION USING OLFACTORY STIMULI

## Abstract
A method for behaviour modification using olfactory stimuli. The method comprises microencapsulating different smelling odors into a patch such that at least one odor is dominant and at least one odor is subservient, placing the patch on a hand associated with the behaviour to be modified, scratching the patch when the urge to engage in the behaviour to be modified occurs, thereby temporarily releasing the subservient odor, smelling the patch with the released subservient odor to act as a stimulus to effect behaviour modification, and smelling the patch after the urge to engage in the behaviour to be modified passes thereby reinforcing the behaviour modification with the dominant odor.
