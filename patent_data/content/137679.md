Is is another object of the present invention to prepare polymerizable dialkenyl diacetylenes, especially polymerizable divinyl diacetylenes. A further object of the present invention is to provide materials comprising diacetylenes having liquid crystalline PhaSes which can be polymerized in the liquid crystalline state.

In accordance with further objects, polymerized articles are provided for optical, electro optical, electro acoustical, mechanical, structural, thermal, conductive, and other uses. Yet another object provides diacetylenes having liquid crystalline phases which are suitable for use in displays or the like. The preparation of articles comprising one or more substrates and one or more layers of compositions comprising liquid crystalline diacetylenes in either the polymerized or unpolymerized state is also an object of the present invention. The foregoing assemblages of substrate and liquid crystalline diacetylene are also provided in accordance with further objects of the invention wherein the diacetylene is oriented inter se with respect to one or more of the substrates. A further object is to provide liquid crystalline diacetylenic materials which may be polymerized in an imagewise fashion. Still further objects will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art from a review of the present specification.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides dialkenyl diacetylenes.especially divinyl diacetylenes, and certain diacetylenes having liquid crystalline states or phases. Dialkenyl diacetylenes in accordance with this invention may be represented by the following formula EMI5.1 While those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that a very wide variety of substituent nR groups may be selected in order to vary the basic structure of dialkenyl diacetylenes, certain groups are presently viewed as having the greatest likelihood of providing one or more of the properties described in connection with the present invention.Accordingly, it is preferred that dialkenyl diacetylenes in accordance with the foregoing formula be provided wherein R1 and R2 may be the same or different and are selected from the group consisting of X, cyano. halogen and alkyl having from 1 to about 3 carbon atoms wherein R3 and R4 may be the same or different and are selected from the group consisting of H, cyano, halogen, amino, aryl and alkyl having from 1 to about 6 carbon atoms and wherein R5 and R6 may be the same or different and are selected from the group consisting of H, alkyl. aryl. aralkyl, alkaryl and heterosubstituted alkyl and aryl having from 1 to about 30 carbon atoms.It is also presently thought possible for one or more of the groups R1, R2, R3 and R4 to comprise further ethylenic unsaturatioa either in or out of conjugation with the indicated double bonds and diacetylene structure. It is generally V believed that liquid crystalline materials should have molecular structures having a high aspect ratio. In this regard, rigid. rod like molecules having anisotropic polarizability are believed to be preferable.Accordingly, it is presently believed that molecules having the following formula may be preferred EMI6.1 wherein R5 and 6 have the meanings attributed previously. Those molecules presently known to exhibit liquid crystalline phases belong to the class of diacetylenes represented by the following formula EMI6.2 wherein R7 and R8 may be the same or different and are selected from the group consisting of H cyano halogen amino nitro hydroxy. sulfoxyl sulfonyl and alkyl. aryl. alkaryl.or aralkyl having from about 1 to about 24 carbon atoms. In the foregoing formulas, R5, R. R7 and R8 may also likely include numerous other substituents such as hydroxy, sulfhydryl, amino, acid ester, amide, sulfamide. halo etc. Those molecules which have presently been found to exhibit liquid crystalline behavior may preferably be represented by the following formula EMI7.1 wherein R9 is alkyl having from about 1 to about 24 carbon atoms. As will be appreciated by those having ordinary skill in the art. the dialkenyl diacetylenes which are prepared in accordance with the present invention may assume cis trans and syn anti isomerisms. It is presently believed that. a griori, each of the possible forms may be suitable for use in connection with one or more embodiments of the present invention. Mixtures of igomeric forms may also be useful.Additionally, mixtures of different diacetylenes may also be emmployed. Dialkenyl diacetylenes may be synthesized by the coupling of monovinyl acetylenes such as through the Chodkowicz. Glaser or other reactions described in those applications from which this application depends and which have been incorporated by reference herein. The corresponding monovinyl acetylenes may be synthesized through the addition of pyridazine l oxide to the Grignard derivative of the desired haloaryl compound or through a Wittig reaction, as explained more fully in the examples. Certain of the derivatives prepared were found to exhibit liquid crystalline behavior. Among these are the p alkylphenyl divinyl diacetylenes represented by the following formula EMI7.2 wherein R9 is alkyl comprising from about 1 to about 24 carbon atoms. The specific members of this class which have.to date, been prepared and tested include methyl, ethyl. propyl and butyl analogues. It is expected that the entire range of alkyl, and probably substituted alkyl phenyl derivatives will similarly exhibit liquid crystalline behavior. Certain of the phenyl divinyl diacetylene compositions synthesized were found not to exhibit liquid crystalline behavior. These included the nitrophenyl , napthenyl , and biphenyl divinyl diacetylenes. It is not yet clear whether the di p cyanophenyl and chlorophenyl divinyl diacetylenes exhibit liquid crystalline behavior. It is also believed that certain monoalkenyl diacetylenes may also exhibit liquid crystalline behavior and polymerizability and that the same may be useful for the purposes set forth herein. Those skilled in the art are readily familiar with the means for determining whether or not a particular chemical species has a liquid crystalline state or phase. In this regard, differential scanning calorimetry, DSC, which provides A graphical representation of heat loss or gain by the material in question as a function of temperature, is generally employed. For materials having a liquid crystal state, the initial negative peak in the DSC plot is shallow, representing a change in phase from solid to liquid crystal rather than from solia to liquid, glass, gas or decomposition products. The solid liquid crystal transition is generally reversible.OtherDSC phenomena may also be demonstrated, including additional transitions from one liquid crystalline state to another a from the liquid crystalline to the liquid state, etc. Liquid crystalline behavior is also indicated via optical microscopy. Liquid crystals exhibit viscous behavior and optical b i ref ringence. A further discussion of the liquid crystal state in polymers and their precursors is presented in Blumstein, Liquid Crvstalline Order in in Polymers , Academic Press, New York 1978 . The differential scanning calorimetry of the para alkylphenyl divinyl diacetylenes in accordance with the present invention, however, illustrate additional, suprising, phenomena. In addition to the solid liquid crystalline transition and, in some cases, additional liquid crystalline inter phase transitions, the materials exhibit a substantial, exothermic DSC peak. This may be seen in Figure 4 for the propyl analog. This substantial peak represents thermal polymerization of the diacetylene in the liquid crystalline state. For further understanding of polymerization in accordance with the present invention, the Physics Today article of Samulski is illustrative. The ability of liquid crystalline divinyl and dialkenyl diacetylenes to polymerize while in their liquid crystalline state is believed to be unique. No other liquid crystalline material has heretofore been known which has been able to be polymerized to yield polymers with conjugated backbone structures. The ability to polymerize the liquid crystalline diacetylene materials in accordance with the present invention permits the preparation of numerous articles having great utility for optical, electro optical, electro acoustical, piezoelectric. mechanical, thermal, conductive, ionic conductive and many other purposes. More particularly, it is possible to prepare articles comprising polymerized or polymerizable liquid crystal diacetylenes which may exhibit wave guiding, electro optic, electro acoustic, pyroelectric and numerous other phenomena. Non linear optical, harmonic geLzrstfnS, p eoelectric and numerous other properties may be evidenced by such materials.In this regard, each of those uses disclosed in connection with Serial Nos. 129,560 and 113,552 may likely employ the liquid crystalline diacetylenes and other materials of the present invention to good advantage. The liquid crystalline materials of the present invention may be polymerized while in the liquid crystalline state through exposure to heat or to initiating radiation.Such polymerization has been found to take place with great efficiency, stereoregularity, and maintenance of intermolecular orientation. Accordingly, polymerization of liquid crystalline diacetylenes from the liquid crystalline state permits, in some cases, the rapid elaboration of polymerizable films or layers upon substrates or otherwise for polymerization. It is also believed to be possible to polymerize such materials in an imagewise fashion. Accordingly, such imagewise processability may enable the present materials to participate in methods and to provide articles in accordance with methods and articles disclosed in Serial No. 340,471.The likely ability to provide imagewise polymerization of the materials of the present invention will facilitate the elaboration of complex optical, electro optical. electro acoustic etc. devices through simplified and straightforward micro lithographic techniques. In accordance with an embodiment of this invention, one or more layers of diacetylenes having a liquid crystalline phase is elaborated upon one or more substrates. In accordance with this preferred embodiment, the layers of diacetylene may be oriented as described by Kahn 1 8 Physics Todav article by surface grooving or via coupling agent molecules, CAMs, either with or without covalent bonding of the diacetylene to theCAM. In addition to those CAMs disclosed in prior applications and by Kahn in the article which has been incorporated herein by reference, substituted organosilanes and related materials including siloxanes. silazanes, chlorosilanes and other materials are preferred.Such silaneous materials are especially suited for the bonding of diacetylenic materials to substrates when the substrates comprise metals. metal oxides.semiconductors, semiconductor oxides. glasses, silicons. quartzes and certain polymers. It is believed that the employment of surface orientation to align diacetylenes in accordance with the present invention inter se and or with regard to one or more substrates, facilitates the organization of liquid crystalline diacetylenes into stable, oriented. organized macroassemblages for further polymerization and or other processing. While the use of CAMs for the physical control of solid surfaces including certain liquid crystalline materials has previously been known. the use in connection with diacetylenes has not been reported heretofore. Thus, it is now possible to prepare articles comprising one or more layers of diacetylene oriented through CAMs to surfaces of one or more substrates to provide many useful articles. Such articles may subsequently be processed to provide still other useful articles.The resulting assemblages or articles may be useful as display devices in accordance with the procedure described by F. J.Kahn in APplied Physics Letter. Vol. 22. p. 386 1973 . Those of skill in the art will recognize the numerous other uses of these techniques. Many other uses of oriented diacetylenes will also be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art.In short, liquid crystal diacetylenes may be employed either with or without orientation and either in bulk, on a substrate or otherwise, in all ways presently known for the employment of liquid crystalline materials. The ability of diacetylenic liquid crystalline materials in accordance with the present invention to be elaborated upon substrates, to be oriented inter se upon the substrates, and to be polymerized while in the oriented liquid crystalline state, is especially useful in view of the highly unique and useful electronic properties of diacetylenic materials. These properties, which are more fully discussed inSerial No. 129,560 and in those other patent applications which have been incorporated herein by reference, permit electrooptic, electro acoustic, mechanical, thermal, conductive, optical, and numerous other devices to be elaborated from diacetylenes. In accordance with the present invention, such elaboration may take place with improved convenience and with higher efficiencies. In order to provide covalent bonding of the diacetylene to the substrate via CAM molecules, it may, in some cases, be necessary to modify the diacetylenic molecule to provide a situs of activity for such bonding. Thus, covalent bonding to the substrate via aminosilanes will generally require the presence of a carboxylic acid or other suitable group at one terminus of the liquid crystalline diacetylene. Other modifications may be selected when other CAMs are desired for use in such covalent bonding, however. In addition to the foregoing, the dialkenyl diacetylenes of the present invention may be seen to have u,nsaturations the olefinic bonds in conjugation with the diacetylene moiety of the diacetylene. Additionally, when further unsaturations such as phenyl rings are incorporated in the dialkenyl diacetylenes of the present invention, further electronic coupling to the diacetylenic backbone may be evidenced. It is presently believed through consideration of theoretical analysis of these systems, that the electronic properties manifested by diacetylenes in general wili be even more apparent and will exist to higher degrees in further conjugated diacetylene materials such as those presently contemplated.Accordingly, such materials are believed to have substantially higher nonlinear optical coefficients than do diacetylenes not having further olefinic conjugation. These effects are maintained upon polymerization since resulting polymers have conjugated unsaturations along the polymer backbones . Liquid crystalline materials have a certain well known ability to serve as host ,species for the inclusion of guest molecules, which guest molecules are not necessarily, themselves, liquid crystalline. Thus, in connection with the present invention, it is possible to include within liquid crystalline diacetylenic compositions, a substantial proportion and even, possibly, a major proportion, of liquid crystalline or non liquid crystalline materials, having particularly desired properties. The resulting host guest mixtures are formulated to have liquid crystalline properties.Among these preferred guest molecules, for example, are materials having substantial nonlinear optical coefficients, different optical absorption spectra, charge transfer, electronic or ionic doping, mechanical properties, etc. In this way, it is possible to employ liquid crystalline materials to carry into an overall liquid crystalline system or array, useful molecules such as those having nonlinear optical properties, and to incorporate such useful molecules in overall polymeric systems. Since many diacetylenes having substantial nonlinear optical coefficients, and other useful properties are known, such as those described in parent application Serial No. 129,560, which has been incorporated herein by reference, and since such materials are expected to be well received as guest molecules in arrays or assemblages of liquid crystalline diacetylenes, the present system is viewed as being an ideal one for the formation of electro optic, electroacoustic, waveguiding and other highly useful optical devices.Moreover, useful structural, display, thermostable, waveguiding. piezoelectric and other uses are possible. Even more preferred materials for inclusion as guest molecules in liquid crystalline d,i,acetylenic organizations are, of course, useful materials which are, themselves. liquid crystalline.Nonlinear optical. liquid crystalline, diacetylenes will benefit from the presence of olefinic bonds in conjugation with the diacetylenic backbone1 of the polymerized or unpolymerized diacetylenes of this invention to result in improvement of the nonlinear optical efficiencies of such molecules. Similar considerations apply, to many other potential guests. Inorganic or organic dopant materials may also be included as guest species. . Thus, for example a iodine.tetracyano quinodimethane and other dopants may likely be added to alter the conductivity of the liquid crystal material or resulting polymer. Other dopants may also be employed as well to modify, for example. electrical and or ionic conductivity. In accordance with the foregoing. reference is made toFigure 1 depicting a substrate 2 overlaid with a layer of a liquid crystalline diacetylene 4. In accordance with a preferred embodiment, a CAM layer 6 is interposed between the diacetylene layer 4 and the substrate 2 to cause orientation of the layer 4 inter se and or with respect to the substrate 2.In accordance with the embodiment, the assemblage of layer and substrate may be placed in an electric and or magnetic field 8 to assist in the alignment of the diacetylene molecules for subsequent processing such as polymerization. Figure 2 depicts the assembly of Figure 1 wherein the liquid crystalline diacetylene layer 4 is surmounted by a second substrate 8. In accordance with this embodiment orientation of the diacetylene layer 4 is facilitated by the intermediation of CAM layers 6 and 10. The assembly of Figure 2 is particularly suited for use as a display device and for many other functions for which liquid crystalline materials are known to be suitable. Polymerization of the diacetylene layer 4 may be had through heating. or, it is believed. by exposure to actinic radiation. The indicated assembly is thus suitable for use as a waveguide or for other optical, electro optical, electro acoustical. etc. uses.Through judicious selection of diacetylenes, electro optical processing. second harmonic generation, and many other useful functions may be performed by the diacetylene layer 4. The material may also be employed as a conductor, insulator, structural laminate or the like. Figure 3 depicts an integrated optical circuit which may be prepared employing the embodiments of the present invention. Thus, a substrate chip 16 is surmounted by a patterned polymer wave guide 18 derived from the diacetylenes and processing methods of the present invention. A source of a light signal such as a LASER light source 20 is also provided which may similarly be prepared in accordance with the present invention. Electrode array 22, optical components 24, detectors or beam couplers 26 and numerous other optical a electro optical, electro acoustic, etc. components may also be included in the device as suggested. Preferably, the components 28 are also incorporated in the device to expedite processing of the optical signals thus generated. As will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art, a very wide variety of optical. electro optical, electro acoustical, waveguiding and other circuit elements, devices and assemblages may be prepared in accordance with the present invention. The f,ollowing examples are intended to be illustrative only and are not to be construed as limiting.

Aminopropylsilation was effected by treatment of the silicon wafers with vapors of 3 aminopropyltriethoxysilane contained in refluxing xylene. The reaction was performed in a dry nitrogen atmosphere. The wafers were treated in this manner for about 16 hours. rinsed with dry xylene, and dried under nitrogen. The water contact angle of the silanated substrate was 470 2e. The silanated substrate was immersed in a solution containing 0.075g. of 10, 12 pentacosadiynoic acid 0.20m.mol. and 0.052g of N, dicyclohexylcarbodimide 0.25m.mol. in lOml of anhydrous pyridine for about 22 hours at room temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere. The wafer was rinsed in pyridine and in ethanol and then dried in vacuo. The water contact angle was found to be 900 2,. Example 10 it is believed that the foregoing technique of Example 9 may be applied two diacetylenes having liquid crystalline phases. Such diacetylene should be modified to include a carboxylic acid or other suitable group at one terminus to provide a situs for covalent bonding to the aminosilane. In the alternative, other CAMs may be substituted for the aminosilane and other well known procedures employed for the covalent bonding. In addition. surface grooving and non covalent CAM orientation are believed to be useful for liquid crystal diacetylene urientation. Example 11 The liquid crystalline diacetylenes of Examples 5 7 may be polymerized in the liquid,crystal state by heating to the polymerization temperature ascettained from DSC evaluation for from about 5 to about 30 minutes.
