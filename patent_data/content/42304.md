# A tracer control system.

## Abstract
In a tracer control system which controls tracing based on displacement signals from a tracer head tracing the surface of a model, there are provided position detectors for detecting the positions of a tracing machine in the X, Y and Z axes and angle correcting means. The difference Δy between a set trace direction O, A, B, C, D, E, F and the actual trace direction OA BC DE F detected by the posi tion detectors is obtained for each fixed distance XO of movement in the X axis, and a trace control velocity in the Y axis direction is corrected by an angle correcting means so that the above said difference Δy may be reduced to zero, thereby controlling tracing to be performed substan tally in the set trace direction.
