# Tire pressure indicating device.

## Abstract
The device includes a coil 16 , mounted in a tire 10 forming with a capacitor 14 a passive oscillatory circuit. The circuit is energised by pulses supplied via a coil 18 positioned outside the tire 10 and secured to the vehicle and the frequency in the passive oscillatory circuit is varied with tire pressure due to changes caused to the capacitance value of the capacitor 14 . The frequency in the passive oscillatory circuit is sensed via a coil 20 positioned outside the tire 10 and secured to the vehicle.
