# Production of porous diaphragm for electrolytic cell.

## Abstract
A process for the production of a porous diaphragm suit able for use in an electrolytic cell, particularly a chlor alkali cell, characterised in that the process comprises irradiating a porous shaped article of an organic polymeric material, for example, a sheet of a fluoropolymer, with high energy radia tion, the irradiation being effected in the presence of, or the irradiated shaped article being subsequently contacted with, a reactant selected from ammonia, carbon monoxide and phosgene, and the sheet preferably being subsequently con tacted with an aqueous alkaline solution.
