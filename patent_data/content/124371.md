# Soft vinyl chloride resin composition.

## Abstract
A soft vinyl chloride resin composition having a light weight and a superior abrasion resistance and lusterless sur face is provided, which composition is obtained by blending 100 parts by weight of a vinyl chloride copolymer consisting of 99.0 to 99.95 by weight of vinyl chloride and 1.0 to 0.05 by weight of a polyethylene glycol diacrylate or a polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate both having 4 to 50 polymerization units of ethylene glycol, mainly with a 5 to 100 parts by weight of a filler having a specific gravity of 0.7 or less and compressive strength of 70 Kg cmÂ² or higher and b 30 to 150 parts by weight of a plasticizer.
