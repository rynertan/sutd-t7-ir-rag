## Description
CORD HOLDER AND DISPENSER The invention relates to a dispensing package for elongated strands1 such as cord, thread or yarn, wound on a spool. The invention also relates to a blank for such a dispensing package. It is known in the prior art to provide such dispensing packages as shown, for example, in CanadianPatent 116,272, Greene et al, issued January 26, 1909 Canadian Patent 271,115, McDougall, issued May 31, 1927 Canadian Patent 601,354, Ruiz, issued July 12, 1960 Canadian Patent 626,871, Zackheim, issued September 5, 1961 U.S. Patent 2,042,311, Kirsch, issued May 26, 1936 andU.S. Patent 3,284,025, issued November 8, 1966. The present invention relates to a dispensing package which is unique in design and construction, and to a blank for such a dispensing package. In accordance with an embodiment of the invention there is provided a blank for a dispensing package for elongated strands, such as cord, thread, yarn or the like, wound on a spool, said blank being made of a rigid but flexible material and comprising a main body portion having a first end and a second end a fold line extending longitudinally of said main body portion from said first end to said second end a first outside flap member and a first inside flap member foldingly connected at the first end of said main body portion a second outside flap member and a second inside flap member foldingly connected at the second end of said main body portion an elongated tab member connected to a free end of one of said outside flap members and a short tab member connected to a like free end of the other one of said flap members. In accordance with a further embodiment of the invention there is provided a dispensing package for e longated strands, such as cord, thread, yarn, or the like, wound on a spool, which comprises a rigid but flexible material a floor member and a parallel ceiling member spaced from said floor member by wall means, said wall means comprising a a two walled arrangement consisting of two walls at an angle to each other and connected to each other at a common edge thereof and b a third wall opposite to said two walled arrangement an opening in said two walled arrangement and blade holder means extending in said opening. The invention will be better understood by an examination of the following description together with the accompanying drawings in which FIGURE 1 is a view of the outside surface of the blank FIGURE 2 is a view of the inside surface of the blank FIGURE 3 is a perspective view of the dispensing package in accordance with the invention FIGURE 4 is a perspective view of the dispensing package with the opening in the ceiling member FIGURE 5 is a perspective view of the dispensing package with the opening in the floor member and FIGURES 6A to 6L show different shapes for the floor and ceiling members of the dis pensing packages. Referring now to Figures 1 and 2, the blank includes a main body portion 1 having a fold line 2 extending longitudinally of the main body portion. The main body portion also has a first end 3 and a second end 5.Foldably connected at the first end is an outside flap member 7 and foldably connected to the second end 5 is an outside flap member 9. Also foldably connected to the first end 3 is an inside flap member 11, and foldably connected to the end 5 is an inside flap member 13. Extending from a free end of the flap member 9 is an elongated tab 15, and extending from a like free end of the flap member 7 is a short tab 17. As can be seen, the free ends of 11 and 13 are somewhat semi circular in shape, and, referring to Figure 2, a series of concentric protrusions 19 are disposed on the inner surface of the flaps 11 and 13. The flaps 7 and 9 are seven sided figures, and the tab 15 extends from a free side of the tab 9 which free side is away from the side foldably connected to the main body portion 1 and extending away from the main body portion. As above mentioned, the tab 17 is connected to a like side of the flap 7. Referring again to Figure 2, the inner surface of the tab 15 includes fastening means 21 for engaging with fastening means 23 on the tab 17. In one embodiment of the invention, the fastening means comprise snaps. Disposed centrally of the main body portion is an opening 25, and a blade holder 27, including a blade 29, extends in the opening 25. Disposed at both side edges of the main body portion are retaining means 31 for retaining the free end of the thread. In the illustrated embodiment, the retaining means are notches in the side edges. Tab means 15 include openings 33 disposed on the longitudinal center line of the tab means. In order to assemble a package from the blank, the main body portion is first folded along the fold line 2. The flaps 11 and 13 are then folded so that they extend inwardly and at right angles to the main body portion 1, and the flaps 7 and 9 are then folded in a like manner to overlie the flaps 11 and 13 respectively. The tabs 15 and 17 are then folded to extend at right angles to their respective flap members to form a wall parallel to the wall formed by the main body portion 1 and opposite thereto. The structure will then have the shape as illustrated in Figure 3. As can be seen in Figure 3, the main body portion forms a two walled arrangement 35, the two walls being at an angle to each other and connected to each other at a common edge thereof. The common edge is, of course, the fold line 2. The tabs 15 and 17 form third wall means, comprising, in this embodiment, a third wall 41 which is parallel to the two walled arrangement and opposed thereto. The flaps form a ceiling 37 and a floor 39 respectively. Disposed on the inner surface of both the ceiling and floor are the concentric circular protrusions 19. The protrusions permit the acceptance of different size spools into the dispensing package. The openings 33 in the third wall 41 permit the package to be hung on the wall on nails or screws. In operation, a spool is placed into the dispensing package by first unfastening the fastening means on the one end of the tabs or inserted prior to full assembly of the dispensing package. The spool will then be supported in both of the protrusions top and bottom for rotatable motion about the center of the concentric circles. A free end of the elongated strand is then pulled out around the outside of the two walled arrangement and, when a desired length of strand has been withdrawn, it is cut off using the blade 29 in the opening 25.The free end of the thread can then be retained in either one of the notches 31 on the side edges of the main body portion. The embodiment illustrated in Figures 1 to 3 will accommodate a role of twine or the like which has a side feed. That is, the free end of the twine comes off the outside of the roll. There are rolls of twine whose free end comes out through the center of the roll. The embodiments illustrated in Figures 1 to 3 could not very easily accommodate such a center feed roll. It is therefore an object to modify the previously illustrated embodiment to be adaptable to accommodating a center feed roll. In order to modify the package to be adaptable to accommodating a center feed roll, an opening is provided in either the floor member or the parallel ceiling member. Referring to Figure 4, the dispensing package 35, also made of a rigid but flexible preferably plastic material, has an opening 101T in the ceiling member 37.As can be seen, the free end of the twine 103 emerges from this central opening and can be lodged in the notches 31 for retention as described with respect to Figures 1 to 3, or brought to the blade 29 for cutting as also abovedescribed. It will, of course, be appreciated that the opening 37 could be located in the floor member 39. Figure 5 illustrates a dispensing package which can also be used with a center feed roll of twine but wherein the opening for the twine 101B is in the floor member 39. Although specific shapes have been aboveillustrated, it will of course be appreciated by one skilled in the art that the dispensing package can take different shapes. Thus, a top view of the dispensing package could be either pear shaped or, in fact, the entire dispensing package could be cylindrical. A variety of different shapes for the floor and ceiling members are illustrated in Figures 6A to 6L. As can be seen, each of the shapes includes an offset OFF as between the blade 29 and the outer periphery of the roll of twine which is inserted in the dispensing package In Figure 61, any one of the corners could be the offset corner . This is to ensure that the outer periphery of the roll does not interfere with the operation of the blade. Thus, a cylindrical package would be useful only when the diameter of the roll is smaller than the diameter of the dispensing package. In the case where the diameter of the roll is substantially equal to the diameter of the dispensing package, then a protruding member would have to be provided for the blade so that the blade holder and blade would protrude outwardly from the outer periphery of the dispensing package. It is also pointed out that the above embodiments illustrated a dispensing package which could be mounted with screws onto a wall. Obviously, it may be unnecessary to have such a mounting means on the dispensing package. Thus, a square shaped top view for the dispensing package is also possible. Although in Figure 2 ridges 19 were shown on members 11 and 13, it would of course be possible to have ridges on only one of the members or, indeed, it would be possible to make the dispenser without any ridges at all without defeating the working of the dispenser in accordance with the invention. The ridges are shown as a preferred embodiment and a preferred feature of the invention. The dispensing package is made of a flexible but rigid material. Preferably, the package is made of a plastic material. Although specific embodiments have been abovedescribed, this was for the purpose of illustrating, but not limiting, the invention. Various modifications, which will come readily to the mind of one skilled in the art, are within the scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims.
