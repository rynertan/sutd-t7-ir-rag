## Description
This invention relates to a novel and useful method for coating a substrate with a coating film of an epoxy resin composition having excellent handling properties, mechanical properties, heat resistance, corrosion resistance and particularly excellent low temperature curability. The epoxy resin is one of the important industrial materials supporting the modern industry and is very useful in a wide range of applications, for example in paints, adhesives, electrical applications or civil engineering applications because it gives a composition having excellent properties including excellent adhesive properties, water resistance, chemical resistance, electrical insulating properties, heat resistance and dimensional stability. Such an epoxy resin composition is generally composed of an epoxy resin prepared from a diphenol typified by bisphenol A and an epoxy group introducing compound typified by epichlorohydrin and a curing agent typified by a polyamine compound, a phenolic resin or an acid anhydride as principal ingredients optionally in combination with a third substance typified by a pigment such as talc, and is used in many applications. Methods of curing these epoxy resins may be divided into those of the room temperature drying type by which the epoxy resins are dried and cured by simply leaving them to stand under natural conditions without the application of any external factor such as heating, and those of the oven drying type by which the drying and curing of the epoxy resins is promoted by applying physical or chemical means such as heat or pressure as external factors either singly or in combination. With epoxy resins of the oven drying type, it is not so difficult, but rather relatively easy, to set up constant stable drying and curing conditions always irrespective of geographical or climatic differences by maintaining external physical factors under constant conditions. The oven drying type epoxy resins are desired to have low temperature curability because energy saving or increased productivity can be achieved by reducing external physical factors such as heat. With regard to the room temperature drying type epoxy resins, the natural conditions are directly the drying and curing conditions. Since many factors including the atmospheric temperature, humidity and the air current incessantly vary, it is difficult to control the drying and curing operation by man s power. In practice, there are many occasions when natural drying and curing is required, for example in coating, adhesion, electrical and civil engineering applications. In particular, most of epoxy based heavy duty paints used as anticorrosive paints for large scale steel structures require operations under natural drying and curing conditions. In these fields, steel materials may be coated and then assembled, or they may be assembled and then coated. Methods of coating conforming to the individual process steps are prescribed. Particularly, when the steel materials are large in size and irregular in shape and are not produced in large quantities in the same size and shape, there is no way, for economic reasons, but to utilize the natural phenomena directly as drying and curing conditions after coating. The same can be said with regard to paints or adhesives for steel pipes, bridges, large sized vehicles, aircraft, buildings, and roads. Most of epoxy resins to be utilized by curing under natural drying and curing conditions are combined with amine type curing agents. The greatest defect of a composition composed of an epoxy resin and an amine type curing agent, however, is a poor low temperature curability, and in some cases, the composition does not at all cure at low temperatures. Attempts have been made to solve the problem of low temperature curability by, for example, using 1 a curing accelerator, 2 a thiokol type curing agent which can react even at low temperatures, 3 an ester type epoxy resin, 4 an epoxy urethane system, or 5 a novolak type epoxy resin. Such methods have been used by utilizing their respective advantages, but have the following defects According to the method 1 , a catalyst which catalyzes the ring opening reaction of an epoxy groups and an amino or imino group, such as a tertiary amine, a phenolic compound or an acidic compound, is used as the curing accelerator. This method is available only at temperatures of 20 C at the lowest. It has the defect that the accelerator acts as a deleterious factor on the various properties of the cured product and that when the temperature goes down to 5 C or to a point below the freezing point, the effect is not observed, and the accelerator itself remains in the cured product. The curing agent in the method 2 basically utilizes the reaction of an epoxy group with a mercapto group. By using it properly in combination with the curing accelerator in 1 , the resulting composition shows excellent curability such that it rapidly cures even at temperatures below the freezing point. On the other hand, the use of this curing agent leads to a loss of many properties expected of an epoxy resin, such as adhesive properties and chemical resistance. Hence, this method is of little practical value, too. The ester type epoxy resin in the method 3 readily reacts with the amino group at low temperatures. If it is used in combination with a suitable curing accelerator, a great improvement in low temperature curability can be expected. Since, however, many ester linkages exist in the cured product as a result of using this method, the inherent properties of the epoxy resin such as water resistance and alkali resistance will be degraded. According to the method 4 , the epoxy resin is cured by an isocyanate curing agent by utilizing the hydroxyl groups therein or increased hydroxyl groups obtained by modifying the resin further while retaining the unique structure of the epoxy resin. This method is actually used for curing epoxy resins at low temperatures. But the epoxy resin is liable to foam and generate gas during curing at high humidity. Furthermore, as a result of the decrease of the hydroxyl groups in the cured product, its adhesive properties are degraded and its corrosion resistance during long term use becomes poor. Furthermore, top coating must be performed at short intervals. Thus, the cured product is very defective in respect of properties other than low temperature curability as compared with general purpose room temperature curable epoxy amine systems. The method 5 contemplates the use of a novolak type epoxy resin obtained by reacting a novolak resin prepared from phenol or cresol and formaldehyde, with epichlorohydrin. A composition comprising this epoxy resin and a curing agent has excellent low temperature curability and improved heat resistance, but suffers from the defect that its adhesion to an iron surface or to the surfaces of other materials is poor and it is immiscible with polyamide type curing agents. In DE B 2521813 there is disclosed a process for preparing epoxy resins by reacting a polyglycidyl ether with a compound having phenolic hydroxy groups. However, in order to cure said epoxy resins it is necessary to heat the epoxy resins to a temperature of 140 to 200 C. These epoxy resins do not cure at low temperature. In DE C 1138542 there are described molding compositions which are also cured by heat and pressure. The compositions are mixed with a basic curing agent at a temperature of 120 C and subsequently treated at a temperature of 170 C in order to obtain useful articles. From GB A 794647 there was known a resinous compound comprising a reaction product of an aromatic hydrocarbon aldehyde resin and an epoxy resin. The known compositions are thermosetting copolymers which must be baked for curing at a temperature of 175 C in the presence of phosphoric acid as a curing agent. Under these circumstances, it has been strongly desired to develop an epoxy resin which retains and improves the inherent properties of a composition composed of a bisphenol A type epoxy resin and a curing agent therefor and excellent low temperature curability. Such a resin would give a good solution to the problem of shortening the drying time as compared with conventional room temperature drying and curing type coating compositions not only at low temperatures but also under relatively mild climatic conditions with higher room temperatures. As a solution which can meet the above earnest desire held over years, the present invention is using an epoxy resin composition having excellent handling properties, mechanical properties, heat resistance, corrosion resistance and particularly excellent low temperature curability, said epoxy resin composition comprising as essential ingredients More specifically, this invention provides the use of a composition comprising A a polyfunctional epoxy resin obtained by using a novolak resin derived from a phenol compound, a novolak resin derived from a diphenol compound or a xylene resin modified with phenol, a substituted phenol or a novolak resin, and B an amine type curing agent for the epoxy resin as essential components. In the present invention, the polyfunctional epoxy resin A denotes a resin having an epoxy equivalent of 180 to 1,800 and a molecular weight of 250 to 5,000. The resin is obtained by reacting a 1 an epoxy resin having an epoxy equivalent of 100 to 800 and a molecular weight of 200 to 2,000, preferably an epoxy equivalent of 160 to 700 and a molecular weight of 250 to 1,800 and containing about 2 glycidyl ether groups derived from a diphenol compound having difunctional phenolic hydroxyl groups per molecule typified by bisphenol A or bisphenol F, with a 2 a molecular weight increasing agent containing 2.1 to 10 phenolic hydroxyl groups on an average per molecule and having a molecular weight of 200 to 2,000, which is a polyhydric phenol having 2.1 to 10, preferably 2.3 to 6, phenolic hydroxyl groups per molecule, in such proportions that the number of the phenolic hydroxyl groups in the molecular weight increasing agent a 2 is less than 1, preferably 0.05 to 0.8, per epoxy group in the epoxy resin a 1 and the resulting polyfunctional epoxy resin A does not gel. The diphenol compound denotes all compounds having about 2 phenolic hydroxyl groups per molecule and includes, for example, compounds represented by the general formula wherein each of R₁ and R₂ represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl or alkenyl group, such as bisphenol A, bisphenol F or isomers thereof and their nuclearly alkylated or halogenated products. The diglycidyl ether type epoxy resin a 1 having about 2 glycidyl ether groups per molecule is obtained by a known method from the diphenol compound and an epoxy group introducing substance such as epichlorohydrin, epibromohydrin or methylepichlorohydrin. An epoxy resin called DGEBPA obtained by using bisphenol A BPA as the diphenol compound is most general. Firstly, the molecular weight increasing agent a 2 includes, for example, a novolak resin respresented by the following general formula wherein each of R₃, R₄ and R₅ represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group such as methyl, ethyl, n butyl, t butyl, octyl or nonyl or an alkenyl group, and n is a rational number of 0.1 to 8, The novolak resin of general formula III is usually obtained as a mixture of compounds of this formula in which n is 0, 1, 2, 3,..... The rational number n of 0.1 to 8 in general formula III means an average value of the mixture. The proportions of the diglycidyl ether type epoxy resin a 1 and the molecular weight increasing agent a 2 used in preparing the polyfunctional epoxy resin A are never arbitrary, but should be such that not more than 1, preferably 0.05 to 0.8, phenolic hydroxyl group in a 2 is used per epoxy group in the resin a 1 . In addition, since the limitation of the proportions of the compounds a 1 and a 2 is set on the basis of the number n in general formula III and the phenolic hydroxyl groups present in the molecule, the proportions should be within the range in which gellation does not occur. The polyfunctional epoxy resin A is obtained by reacting the epoxy resin a 1 with the molecular weight increasing agent a 2 in the limited proportions described above in the presence of a known conventional catalyst such as sodium hydroxide or a tertiary amine and heating the mixture to react the epoxy groups of the epoxy resin a 1 with the phenolic hydroxyl groups of the molecular weight increasing agent a 2 . The low temperature curability of the resulting epoxy resin depends upon the number of the functional groups of the polyfunctional epoxy resin A so obtained, and therefore, the combination of the epoxy resin a 1 and the molecular weight increasing agent a 2 is the most important factor. Specifically, by causing the number of the functional groups of the polyfunctional epoxy resin A to infinitely approach 2, the factor of low temperature curability is infinitely decreased. On the basis of this information, the polyfunctional as used in this invention denotes at least 2.1 functional groups on an average, and not more than 10 functional groups on an average in view of workability, in order to obtain practical low temperature curability which meets the object of this invention. The curing agent B for the epoxy resin is an amine type curing agent, namely a preliminary co condensation product of triethylenetetramine and EPICLON 1050 75X being an epoxy resin with an epoxy equivalent of 475. By using the polyfunctional epoxy resin A and the curing agent B as essential ingredients, the required properties such as handling properties, hardness, water resistance, and corrosion resistance can be obtained early in natural room temperature curing and drying. In particular, since the dryability of the resin in the winter time or in cold districts is good, the range of application of the epoxy resin composition can be widened greatly. As required, the compositions of this invention may include organic compounds such as curing accelerators, solvents, diluents, bitumens and petroleum resins and inorganic substances such as glasses, carbons, pigments e.g. titanium oxide, talc and silica or fibers.
