# CONTROL DEVICE FOR A TORQUE CONVERTER IN AN AUTOMATIC SPEED CHANGE GEAR FOR VEHICLES.

## Abstract
In an automatic transmission for a vehicle in which an input shaft 2 is connected to a driving shaft 1 of an engine through a torque converter T provided with a pump wheel 5p connecting to the driving shaft 1 and a turbine wheel 5t connecting to the input shaft 2 , a torque convertor controlling system which is provided with a hydraulically operated clutch D inserted between the pump wheel 5p and the turbine wheel 5t for directly connecting these wheels, and a centrifugal valve F between a hydraulic cylinder 14 of the directly connecting clutch D and a high pressure fluid channel 28 connecting to the fluid source P and a low pressure fluid channel 29 connecting to a fluid reservoir R so that the hydraulic cylinder 14 is connected to the low pressure fluid channel 29 during a lower speed rotation period whereas the hydraulic cylinder 14 is connected to the high pressure fluid channel 28 by the centrifugal valve F in cooperation with the turbine wheel 5t .
