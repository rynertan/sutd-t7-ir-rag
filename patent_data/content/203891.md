The compounds of the invention exhibit valuable pharmacological properties, e.g. by selectively blocking the N methyl D aspartate sensitive excitatory aminoacid receptors in mammals. The compounds are thus useful for treating diseases responsive to excitatory amino acid blockade in mammals, comprising e.g. nervous system disorders, particularly convulsive disorders epilepsy and anxiety. These effects are demonstrable in The inhibitory effect on the NMDA type excitatory amino acid receptors is determined in vitro by measuring the inhibition of the NMDA evoked ³H acetylcholine ³H ACh release from corpus striatum tissue of rat brain, according to J. Lehmann and B. Scatton, Brain Research Antagonists of NMDA type excitatory amino acid receptors competitively antagonize NMDA evoked ³H acetylcholine ³H ACh release from corpus striatum tissue of the brain. The inhibition of the NMDA evoked ³H acetylcholine ³H ACh release from rat striatal tissue slices by a compound of the invention is expressed as of release of ³H ACh in response to stimulation with 50 µM NMDA compared to control. Tests are two tailed with a minimum of n 4 in each group. IC₅₀ values represent the concentration of test compound required to inhibit the NMDA increased ³H ACh release by 50 . Illustrative compounds of the invention have IC₅₀ values as low as about 8 10 ⁶M in the in vitro NMDA evoked ³H ACh release test. The inhibitory effect on the NMDA type excitatory amino acid receptors is demonstrated in vivo by inhibition of NMDA induced convulsions in the mouse. Illustrative compounds of the invention prevent NMDA induced convulsions in the mouse at doses as low as about 2.3 mg kg i.p. Further indicative of the anticonvulsant activity, compounds of the invention are effective in preventing audiogenic induced seizures in DBA 2 mice Chapman et al., Arzneim. Forsch. The effect is determined as follows Forty five minutes following compound or vehicle administration, mice are placed individually in a soundproof chamber. After a 30 second accommodation period, the mice are exposed to a sound stimulation of 110 dB for 1 minute or until the appearance of a tonic clonic seizure. Control seizures consist of an initial wild running phase. The prevention of wild running is indicative of an anticonvulsant effect. Test compounds in either distilled water solution or in a 3 w v colloidal cornstarch suspension containing 5 w v polyethylene glycol 400 and 0.34 w v Tween 80 , are administered by oral intubation or intraperitoneally in a volume of 10 ml kg of body weight. Illustrative compounds of the invention are effective in the audiogenicinduced seizure model in mice with an ED₅₀ as low as about 1.8 mg kg on i.p. administration. Indicative of anxiolytic activity, compounds of the invention are effective in the Cook Davidson conflict model Psychopharmacologia The aforementioned advantageous properties render the compounds of the invention useful as antagonists of the N methyl D aspartate excitatory amino acid receptor in mammals and for the treatment of conditions responsive thereto, such as anxiety and convulsive disorders. The compounds of the invention, i.e. the compounds cited hereinabove, may be prepared by conventional processes, e.g. by and, if desired, converting a resulting compound of the invention into another compound of the invention, and or, if desired, converting a resulting free compound into a salt or a resulting salt into the free compound or into another salt and or separating a mixture of isomers or racemates obtained into the single isomers or racemates and or, if desired, resolving a racemate obtained into the optical antipodes. Reactive esterified hydroxy, in any of the herein mentioned processes, e.g. X in a compound of formula VIII, is esterified by a strong acid, especially hydrohalic, e.g. hydrochloric, hydrobromic or hydroiodic acid, or sulphuric acid, or by a strong organic acid, especially a strong organic sulfonic acid, such as an aliphatic or aromatic sulfonic acid, for example methanesulfonic acid, 4 methylphenylsulfonic acid or 4 bromophenylsulfonic acid. Said reactive esterified hydroxy is especially halo, for example chloro, bromo or iodo, or aliphatically or aromatically substituted sulfonyloxy, for example methanesulfonyloxy, phenylsulfonyloxy or 4 methylphenylsulfonyloxy tosyloxy . In starting compounds and intermediates therefor which are converted to the compounds of the invention in a manner described herein, functional groups present, such as carboxy, amino including ring NH and hydroxy groups, are optionally protected by conventional protecting groups that are common in preparative organic chemistry. Protected carboxy, amino and hydroxy groups are those that can be converted under mild conditions into free carboxy, amino and hydroxy groups without the molecular framework being destroyed or other undesired side reactions taking place. The purpose of introducing protecting groups is to protect the functional groups from undesired reactions with reaction components and under the conditions used for carrying out a desired chemical transformation. The need and choice of protecting groups for a particular reaction is known to those skilled in the art and depends on the nature of the functional group to be protected carboxy group, amino group, etc. , the structure and stability of the molecule of which the substituent is a part, and the reaction conditions. Well known protecting groups that meet these conditions and their introduction and removal are described, for example, in J.F.W. McOmie, Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry , Plenum Press, London, New York 1973, T.W. Greene, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis , Wiley, New York 1981, and also in The Peptides , Vol. I, Schroeder and Luebke, Academic Press, London, New York 1965, as well as in Houben Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie , Vol. 15 l, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart, 1974. The preparation of the compounds of the invention according to process a relating to reduction of a compound of formula VII is e.g. carried out by methods known in the art for the reduction of pyrrole, pyridine, indole and quinoline rings. For example, the reduction of the pyridine or quinoline ring is advantageously carried out with an organometallic reducing agent or by catalytic hydrogenation e.g. in the presence of platinum oxide and an acidic solvent such as acetic acid to give corresponding piperidines, 1,2,3,4 tetrahydroquinolines or perhydroquinolines of the invention, i.e. of formula II or IV and derivatives thereof. Quaternary quinolinium and pyridinium compounds, e.g. in which R² is lower alkyl or aryl lower alkyl, may be similarly reduced. These starting compounds of formula VII, wherein Het has one or more double bonds, e.g. the quinoline and pyridine derivatives, wherein Het denotes an optionally substituted R¹ pyridyl or R¹ quinolinyl group and A is C₁ C₄alkylene, are prepared, e.g. by first condensing a compound of the formula Het A X VIIa e.g. in form of a halide, such as a chloride or bromide, with a diester of formula IX in the presence of a strong base, e.g. as described in Chemical Abstracts Subsequent treatment with e.g. a peracid, such as m chloroperbenzoic acid gives the corresponding pyridine N oxides or quinoline N oxides. Condensation with a reactive cyanide, e.g. a trialkylsilyl cyanide such as trimethylsilyl cyanide, preferably under basic conditions, e.g. in the presence of triethylamine, gives the corresponding 2 cyanopyridine or 2 cyanoquinoline derivatives. The cyano groups in the 2 cyanopyridine and 2 cyanoquinoline derivatives are then converted, by methods known in the art, to the 2 R¹ substituted pyridine and quinoline derivatives as defined hereinabove. The preparation of the compounds of formula I and derivatives from compounds of formula VII, wherein A represents lower alkenylene or lower alkanylidene with the double bond attached to the heterocyclic ring, according to process a is carried out by e.g. catalytic hydrogenation. These starting materials of formula VII may be prepared, e.g. by reacting an aldehyde or ketone including oxo derivatized heterocyclic five or six membered rings with e.g. a tetra lower alkyl ester of methylenedi phosphonic acid under basic conditions, thereby adding the phosphono methylidene grouping to obtain a compound of formula VII wherein A represents trivalent methylidene with the double bond attached to the heterocyclic ring. The condensation according to process b of a compound of formula VIII with a compound of formula X, e.g. triethyl phosphite, is carried out, e.g. by heating in an inert solvent, and under conditions known in the art for a Michaelis Arbuzov reaction according to Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. The condensation according to process b of a compound of formula VIII with a compound of formula IX, e.g. diethylphosphonate diethyl phosphite , is carried out e.g. in a strong basic medium, for instance in the presence of an alkali metal, e.g. sodium, an alkali metal hydride, e.g. sodium hybride, an alkali metal alkoxide, e.g. potassium t butoxide, in an inert solvent e.g. toluene or dimethylformamide. The starting materials of formula VIII are either known in the art or are prepared by methods known in the art, e.g. by reduction of the corresponding pyridinyl, indolyl and quinolinyl compounds. Interconversions according to process c are carried out by methods well known in the art. Groups convertible into R¹ are, for example, carboxy groups in form of anhydrides or acid halides, cyano, amidino groups, including cyclic amidino groups such as 5 tetrazolyl, iminoether groups, including cyclic iminoether groups, e.g. dihydro 2 oxazolinyl or dihydro 2 oxazolinyl groups substituted by lower alkyl, and also hydroxymethyl, etherified hydroxymethyl, lower alkanoyloxymethyl, trialkoxymethyl, acetyl, trihalo acetyl, halomethyl, carboxycarbonyl COCOOH , formyl CHO , di lower alkoxymethyl, alkylenedioxymethyl or vinyl. Certain terms used in the processes have the meanings as defined below.

Groups convertible into R¹ representing carboxy include esterified and amidated carboxy and such are not limited to esterified and amidated carboxy as defined herein for R¹. Conversion to carboxy is generally accomplished by solvolysis, with acid or base. Benzyloxycarbonyl or nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl may be converted into carboxy by catalytic hydrogenation, the latter also with chemical reducing agents, e.g. sodium dithionite or with zinc and a carboxylic acid. In addition, tert butyloxycarbonyl may also be cleaved with trifluoroacetic acid. Acetyl may be oxidatively cleaved to carboxy by conversion first to trihaloacetyl, e.g. tribromo or triiodoacetyl, by treatment e.g. with sodium hypobromite, followed by cleavage with e.g. an aqueous base, e.g. sodium hydroxide. Formyl, di lower alkoxymethyl or alkylenedioxymethyl formyl protected in the form of an acetal , e.g. the dimethyl acetal, are oxidized with e.g. silver nitrate, pyridinium dichromate or ozone to carboxy. Vinyl may be converted to carboxy by ozonolysis to formyl, which is in turn oxidized to carboxy. Hydrolysis of trialkoxymethyl to carboxy is advantageously carried out with inorganic acids, e.g. hydrohalic or sulfuric acid. Hydrolysis of etherified hydroxymethyl to hydroxymethyl is preferably carried out with solutions of inorganic acids, e.g. a hydrohalic acid. Hydroxymethyl is in turn oxidized to carboxy with an oxidizing agent, e.g. pyridinium dichromate. Halomethyl may also be converted to the corresponding carboxaldehydes with e.g. dimethylsulfoxide in the presence of triethylamine and silver tetrafluoroborate, or with chromium trioxide and pyridine in methylene chloride. The conversion of cyano to C₁ C₄alkoxycarbonyl is advantageously carried out by treatment first with a lower alkanol, e.g. anhydrous ethanol, in the presence of a strong acid, e.g. hydrochloric acid preferably at reflux temperature, followed by hydrolysis with water. Furthermore, the conversion of cyano to carbamoyl is preferably carried out by treatment with an alkali metal hydroxide, e.g. dilute sodium hydroxide, and hydrogen peroxide, preferably at room temperature. C₁ C₄Alkoxycarbonyl may be amidized with ammonia or a N mono or N,N di C₁ C₄alkylamine e.g. methylamine or dimethylamine in an inert solvent, e.g. a lower alkanol, such as butanol, to unsubstituted, N mono or N,N di C₁ C₄alkylcarbamoyl. The compounds of the invention may thus also be converted to other compounds of the invention by e.g. functional group transformations well known in the art. For example, conversion of carboxylic acid esters and amides to carboxylic acids is advantageously carried out by hydrolysis with inorganic acids such as a hydrohalic or sulfuric acid or with aqueous alkalies, preferably alkali metal hydroxides such as lithium or sodium hydroxide. Free carboxylic acids may be esterified with C₁ C₄alkanols, such as ethanol, in the presence of a strong acid, e.g. sulfuric acid, or with diazo C₁ C₄alkanes, e.g. diazomethane, in a solvent such as ethyl ether, advantageously at room temperature, to give the corresponding lower alkyl esters. Furthermore, the free carboxylic acids may be converted via treatment of a reactive intermediate thereof, e.g. an acyl halide such as the acid chloride, or a mixed anhydride, e.g. such derived from a lower alkyl halocarbonate such as ethyl chloroformate, with ammonia or an N mono or N,N di C₁ C₄alkylamine, in an inert solvent such as methylene chloride, preferably in the presence of a basic catalyst such as pyridine, to compounds wherein R¹ represents unsubstituted, N mono or N,N di C₁ C₄ alkylcarbamoyl. Phosphonic acid esters are converted to the corresponding phosphonic acids by treatment with acid, such as aqueous hydrochloric acid or hydrobromic acid in glacial acetic acid, or with bromotrimethylsilane according to J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Comm. Phosphonic acids are converted to esters, e.g. C₁ C₄alkyl or C₂ C₇ alkanoyloxymethyl esters, e.g. by condensation with a C₁ C₄alkyl halide or C₂ C₇alkanoyloxymethylhalide preferably in a basic non aqueous medium, such as in the presence of triethylamine. The compounds of the invention wherein the heterocylic ring represents optionally substituted tetrahydroquinolinyl, dihydroindolyl or dihydropyrrolyl and derivatives thereof are converted to the corresponding perhydroquinolinyl, perhydroindolyl or pyrrolidinyl compounds, respectively, e.g. by catalytic hydrogenation. The above mentioned reactions are carried out according to standard methods, in the presence or absence of diluents, preferably such that are inert to the reagents and are solvents thereof, of catalysts, of condensing or said other agents respectively and or in inert atmospheres, at low temperatures, room temperature or elevated temperatures, preferably at the boiling point of the solvents used, and at atmospheric or super atmospheric pressure. The preferred solvents, catalysts and reaction conditions are set forth in the appended illustrative examples. The invention further includes any variant of the present processes, in which an intermediate product obtainable at any stage thereof is used as starting material and the remaining steps are carried out, or the process is discontinued at any stage thereof, or in which the starting materials are formed under the reaction conditions, or in which the reaction components are used in the form of their salts or optically pure antipodes. Mainly those starting materials should be used in said reactions, that lead to the formation of those compounds indicated above as being especially preferred. The invention also relates to any novel starting materials and processes for their manufacture. Depending on the choice of starting materials and methods, the new compounds may be in the form of one of the possible isomers or mixtures thereof, for example, depending on the number of asymmetrical carbon atoms, as pure optical isomers, such as antipodes, or as mixtures of optical isomers such as racemates or as mixtures of diastereoisomers or of geometric isomers. The aforesaid possible isomers or mixtures thereof are within the purview of this invention certain particular isomers are preferred as indicated above. Any resulting mixtures of diastereoisomers, mixtures of racemates can be separated on the basis of the physicochemical differences of the constituents, in known manner, into the pure isomers, diastereoisomers, racemates, or geometric isomers, for example by chromatography and or fractional crystallization. Any resulting racemates can be resolved into the optical antipodes by known methods, for example by e.g. reacting an acidic end product with an optically active base that forms salts with the racemic acid, and separating the salts obtained in this manner, for example by fractional crystallization, into the diastereoisomeric salts from which the optically active free carboxylic or phosphonic acid antipodes can be liberated on acidification. The basic racemic products can likewise be resolved into the optical antipodes, e.g. by separation of the diastereo isomeric salts thereof, with an optically active acid, and liberating the optically active basic compound by treatment with a standard base. Racemic products of the invention can thus be resolved into their optical antipodes, e.g., by the fractional crystallization of d or ℓ tartrates, mandelates, camphorsulfonates or of d or ℓ α methylbenzylamine, cinchonidine, cinchonine, quinine, quinidine, ephedrine, dehydroabiethylamine, brucine or strychnine salts. The acidic compounds of the invention can also be resolved by separating diastereomeric ester or amide derivatives prepared from an optically active alcohol or amine, and regenerating the resolved optically active compound. Advantageously, the more active of the two antipodes is isolated. Finally the compounds of the invention are either obtained in the free form, or as a salt thereof. Any resulting base can be converted into a corresponding acid addition salt, preferably with the use of a therapeutically useful acid or anion exchange preparation, or resulting salts can be converted into the corresponding free bases, for example, with the use of a stronger base, such as a metal or ammonium hydroxide or a basic salt, e.g. an alkali metal hydroxide or carbonate, or a cation exchange preparation, or an alkylene oxide such as propylene oxide. A compound of the invention with a free carboxylic or phosphonic acid group can thus also be converted into the corresponding metal or ammonium salts. These or other salts, for example, the pricrates, can also be used for purification of the bases obtained the bases are converted into salts, the salts are separated and the bases are liberated from the salts. In view of the close relationship beween the free compounds and the compounds in the form of their salts, whenever a compound is referred to in this context, a corresponding salt is also intended, provided such is possible or appropriate under the circumstances. The compounds, including their salts, can also be obtained in the form of their hydrates, or include other solvents used for their crystallization.
