# A bias voltage supply circuit.

## Abstract
A bias voltage supply circuit having a relatively stable constant voltage during load current fluctuations and driven by a relatively low DC power supply voltage, includes a DC power supply terminal 10 , a DC current source 16 , a first transistor 26 connected at its collector to the DC power supply terminal via the DC current source, a first resistor 20 connected between the emitter of the first transistor and a reference potential terminal 14 , a second transistor 28 connected by its collector emitter circuit in parallel with the series circuit of the DC current source and the first transistor, the base of the second transistor being connected to the collector of the first transistor, a second resistor 30 connected in parallel with the collector base circuit of the first transistor and an output terminal 22 connected to the base of the first transistor.
