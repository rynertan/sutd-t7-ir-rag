## Description
A SYSTEM FOR CONTROLLING THE ANGULAR POSITION OF A ROTARY MEMBER The invention relates to systems for controlling the angular position of a rotary member and in particular to controlling the position of a gun turret. Armed mobile vehicles often have turrets which are movable in azimuth and which carry weapons which are movable within the turrets in elevation. In the instance where the weapon is mounted off the centre of rotation in azimuth, the weapon recoil when the weapon is fired will impose a torque about the azimuth rotation axis. Additional torques about the azimuth axis will be imparted to the turret when the counter recoil forces are applied thereto as the breech bolt slams forward into the back of the chamber structure preparatory to firing the ensuing round.Spurious torques may also be experienced about the elevation axis for the weapon as the vehicle rocks on its suspension due to weapon recoil. When an ammunition feed belt is attached to the weapon breech, additional spurious torques about the elevation axis will be imposed due to the feed belt reaction forces. By way of example, a typical offset, single 20 millimeter turret mounted weapon carried in an armoured vehicle where the weapon is capable of being directed in azimith and elevation will impart 6,000 ft. lbs. of torque at the turret azimuth ring drive gear for each round fired. This torque level may be substantially overcome in a weapons control system by providing a coupling between motor and turret or weapon having a high reflected drive train inertia to the turret. However, such an approach results in well known system backlash errors and response time disadvantages. Further, at firing stages of 200 rounds per minute or greater, accumulated error due to the successive recoil torques is unacceptable. Velocity feedback in control systems is well known. Such a system is seen in U.S.Patent 3,041,518, issued to Blomqvist et al, which relates to a system for controlling the position of a gun barrel to obtain appropriate lead on a target being tracked. In one embodiment described by Blomqvist et al a filter network is provided in the forward control loop which appears to impose a time displacement in the fire control signal provided at the system input in order to provide said firing lead. Blomqvist et al further describe a servo motor for driving the gun mount which is energized by the system output signal and which has an output shaft on which is mounted a gear which meshes with an arc gear attached to the breech ring of the gun barrel.Blomqvist et al do not deal with the critical problem area, relating to relative drive train and driven member inertias together with drive gear ratios, which is so vital in obtaining an acceptable system response. The present invention aims at avoiding the disadvantages of the prior art and is characterised in that the coupling has a low reflected rotational inertia relative to the inertia of the rotary member, and that the control means is responsive to the level of the rate signal relative to the level of the command signal, when the rotary member is subjected to a spurious torque, to cause the motor drive signal to have such level and duration as to displace the rotary member to negate the displacement of the member effected by the spurious torque. A gun turret control system embodying the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying diagrammatic drawings in which Figure 1 is a block diagram of the control system Figure 2 is a partial isometric view of a gun turret showing the drive train and driven members controlled by the control system of Fig.l Figure 3 is a circuit diagram of the control circuitry for one control channel of the control system of Fig.l and Figure 4 is a timing diagram showing system transient conditions induced by application of an external torque to the driven members of the gun turret. In controlling a rotatable member about an axis of rotation a feedback signal is used which is related to the angular velocity of the rotatable member about the rotation axis. If external torques are applied to the rotatable member so that the member is moved away from an initial position about the axis of rotation the velocity feedback will arrest the motion due to the spurious torques, but will not serve to return the rotatable member to the initial angular position. In the control system to be described the rotatable member is returned to the original angular position by means of an automatically generated return motor drive signal which is coupled to the drive system. The system accomplishes automatic correction for angular positon error imposed on a gun turret by spurious external torques applied about the rotation of axis of the turret by weapon recoil, while simultaneously presenting a low reflected drive train inertia to the rotatable member with consequent system response advantages. As seen in Figure 1 of the drawings a turret 11 is movable rotationally in azimuth about an azimuth axis and carries a weapon 12 which is in turn movable rotationally in elevation about an elevation axis. The turret 11 is movable in azimuth through the interaction of an azimuth ring gear 13, seen in Figure 2, and a single azimuth drive gear 14 mounted on a shaft 16 extending from a servo motor 17. An arc gear 18 is attached to structure which is attached to the breech of the weapon 12, moving therewith. The arc gear 18 meshes with a single elevation drive gear 19 for driving the weapon in elevation. The elevation drive gear is mounted to the end of a shaft 21 which is driven rotationally by a second servo motor 22. The servo motors 17 and 22 may be seen Figure 2 to drive the turret 11 about the azimuth axis and the weapon 12 about the elevation axis respectively. The drive about both the azimuth and elevation axes is direct, being accomplished through the single gear members 14 and 19. The gear ratios in the embodiment described herein have been selected as 25 1 for the elevation drive and 45 1 for the azimuth drive. High torsional stiffness is provided by the 2.54 cm diameter motor shafts 16 and 21 which transfer the servo motor torques to the respective drive gears mounted thereon.With only one gear mesh required for each axis of drive and high shaft torsional stiffness, extremely low mechanical backlash and drive train inertias result as will hereinafter be shown. A21 appropriate servo motor for use in this application is Model TT1953 manufactured by Inland Motor Division, Kollmorgen Corporation, Radford,Virginia, U.S.A. Such motors are combination servo motors and tachometers which respond to a power signal to provide shaft output torque and simultaneously providel1 output signal indicative of the rotational speed of the motor. Referring now to Figure 1, the system is shown in block form wherein the elevation and azimuth command channels are seen to be similar. Therefore primed numbers are applied to like circuit portions in the elevation channel. An azimuth command device 23 is provided which is controlled by an operator and which provides an input command signal to an amplification and external torque compensation network 24. A direction selection circuit portion 26 is coupled to the output of the amplification and torque compensation network providing appropriate clockwise or counterclockwise output signals up or down for elevation to the azimuth drive motor 17 elevation drive motor 22 for elevation . An azimuth angular velocity sensor 27 is coupled to the azimuth drive motor elevation angular velocity sensor 28 being coupled to the elevation drive motor , which sensor provides an angular velocity indicative output signal which is fed back to the input signal of the amplifier and external torque compensation circuit 24 where an error signal, ev, is generated by comparing the input command signal and the feedback signal. As mentioned hereinbefore, the azimuth and elevation servo motors 17 and 22 have tachometers included in the motor housings which serve as the azimuth and elevation angular velocity sensors 27 and 28 respectively. The efficiency of operation of the system containing the aforementioned servo motors 17 and 22 is measured by the ratio of the horsepower at the servo motor shafts 16, 21 to the electrical power input to the system. Due to the direct drive feature described hereinbefore an efficiency of 90 is observed in the disclosed system as compared with a presently available system that uses electrical drive motors which exhibit approximately 40 efficiency. Readily available hydraulic actuated control systems of this type commonly operate at 25 efficiency. Moreover, the direct drive feature disclosed herein provides for an extremely low commanded threshold velocity. The vital absense of backlash and the low reflected drive train inertias allow a command threshold of approximately 0.05 millirad sec. In Figure 3, the control circuit for the azimuth control channel is shown. The circuitry for the elevation control channel is substantially identical to that shown in Figure 3 and therefore only the azimuth control circuitry will be described in detail hereinThe azimuth command device 23 is seen as including a variable resistor or potentiometer R3 having a positiveDC voltage V coupled to one end thereof and a negativeDC voltage V coupled to the other end thereof with a command connected centre tap indicated at C. A movable contact is provided on variable resistor R3 which is positioned as desired by the operator to provide the appropriate input command signal to drive the gun turret 11 either clockwise V or counterclockwise V . The input command signal from R3 is coupled through resistors R4 and R5 to the inverting input on a differential amplifier Al which forms the summing junction for the applied signal and the feedback signal.The output from tachometer 27 driven by motor 17 is shown coupled to the non inverting input of differential amplifier Al. The tachometer output is referenced to common C as shown It may be seen that when the movable contact on variable resistor R3 is positioned at the common point and servo motor 17 is still, there is no differential input to amplifier Al and the amplifier output level will be at zero. Parallel feedback paths are shown around differential amplifier Al consisting of resistor R7 in one path and the series combination of resistor R8 and capacitor C2 in the other path The path in the circuit of Figure 3 through which a clockwise V input command signal from the movable contact on variable resistor R3 is processed from the output of amplifier Al includes amplifier A2, resistor R12 and transistors Q1, Q3 and Q5.The power side of the circuit for clockwise torque from motor 17 is actuated by transistor Q5 through transistors Q14 and Qll. The ground side of the circuit for clockwise torque is actuated by transistor Q5 through transistorsQ8 and QlO. A counterclockwise input command signal is processed from the output of amplifier Al through amplifier A3, resistor R40 and transistors Q2, Q4 andQ6. Transistor Q6 actuates the power side of the circuit for counterclockwise motor torque through transistors Q7 and Qll and actuates the ground side of the circuit through transistors Q15 and Q13 The power to motor 17 is pulse width modulated by a one shot device 29. A positive signal level at pin 11 from either A2 or A3 provides a positive pulse train output at pin 9 at the fixed frequency of an oscillator 31.The width of the pulses in the output pulse train is a direct function of the positive level at the output signal from either amplifier A2 or A3. In this fashion the DC current to motor 17 is pulse width modulated as either transistor Q5 CW or Q6 CCW is switched ON and OFF by the positive pulses from one shot device 29. The output of the differential amplifier Al is coupled through resistor R9 to the inverting input of amplifier 42 and directly to the non inverting input of amplifier A3 which form a portion of the amplification and external torque compensation network 24.A predetermined output level from amplifier Al, for example 3 volts, will saturate both amplifiers A2 andA3 which results in a maximum output torque from servo motor 17 as will hereinafter be described. The outputs of amplifiers of A2 and A3 will necessarily be of opposite polarity for a given common input. When the output of either A2 or A3 is at a positive level, a positive voltage will appear at the input terminal of the one shot device indicated at 29. The diodes Dl and D2 maintain the positive signal level from eitherA2 or A3 at the input terminal of the one short. A positive output from A2 or A3 will also turn ON respective transistors Q1 or Q2. In the event that transistor Q1 is turned ON, transistor Q3 will be turned OFF. When transistor Q3 is turned OFF transistor Q5 is enabled and can thereafter be turned ON intermittently by positive pulses at the output terminal of one shot device 29. The one shot device functions so that the more positive the input signal at the input terminal the more the positive pulse width of the output is extended. When transistor Q5 is turned ON to initiate clockwise motion of the motor 17, the PNP devices Q8 and Q14 are also turned ON. With Q14 turned ON, the positive voltage, Vm, is applied to the base of Q12 and is so also supplied to one terminal of the DC servo motor 17 through the transistor Q12. The opposite terminal voltage on servo motor 17 is connected to the base of transistor Q10, switching current therethrough and thereby providing a DC current path through Q10 and resistor R32 to ground for the armature current through the servo motor 17. If differential amplifier Al produces a positive output counterclockwise rotation desired then the output of amplifier A3 is positive while the output from amplifier A2 is negative. As a result, a positive signal is available at the input terminal of the one shot device 29 to control the width of the output pulse therefrom. Transistor Q2 is turned ON, transistor Q1 held OFF, and the transistor Q4 turned OFF, thereby enabling the transistor Q6 to conduct the modulated output pulses from one shot 29. The positive pulses from the one shot cause the transistor Q6 to conduct which in turn causes the PNP devices Q7 and Q15 to conduct.The positive motor voltage, Vm, is thereby connected to turn ON transistor Qll through Q7 and to feed DC current to the armature of servo motor 17 through Qll. Transistor Q13 is also turned ON by the voltage level at the opposite terminal of servo motor 17 during such counterclockwise driving of the motor providing a complete circuit to ground for the armature motor current throughQ13 and resistor R32. The free running oscillator 31 is coupled to the one shot device 29 to provide a pulse frequency for the output pulses from the one shot device 29. Thus, the output from one shot 29 is a series of positive pulses at the oscillator frequency which have pulse widths dependent upon the level of the signal at the input terminal. In this fashion, through the circuitry described hereinbefore, the servo motor 17 is driven by a series of pulses having an amplitude Vmand a pulse width determined by the level of the output signal from either amplifier A2 or A3. The oscillator 31 and the one shot device 29 may be obtained in a single package designated SE556 provided by Signetics Corporation,Mountain View, California. A DC to DC power supply 32, exemplified by StevensArnold Model PS4248, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America, has coupled thereto a conventional voltage regulator 33 and is powered by the motor voltage sourceVm. The power supply 32 provides the control circuit voltages V and V and the common 0 volt signal level C.Overvoltage protection is provided by the Zener diode Z1 which breaks down when Vm reaches an unacceptably high level. The breakdown of Z1 causes transistor Q16 to turn ON, grounding the reset terminal R on the oneshot device 29. Output pulses from the one shot device are then suppressed for as long as the low level input remains at the reset terminal. An over current protection for the circuitry is provided by a voltage divider which includes resistors R29 and R30. When the current through the divider resistors R29 and R30 becomes so high that the common terminal therebetween is raised to a level such that transistor Q9 is turned ON then the reset terminal R of one shot device 29 is also placed at ground level through Q9, and output pulses from pin 9 are suppressed. As shown in Figure 3, servo motor 17 is coupled mechanically to the turret 11 to drive the turret about the azimuth axis. Current through the servo motor 17 from Q12 to Q10 will cause an output shaft torque in the clockwise sense, and a current in the opposite direction from Qll to Q13 will cause an output shaft torque in the counterclockwise sense. By way of further describing the azimuth control operation, when the azimuth command device 23 is moved so that the sliding contact on resistor R3 has a positive voltage thereon with respect to common for clockwise rotation ,the differential amplifier Al will provide a negative output therefrom. The negative output being directed to the positive input terminal of amplifier A3 will provide a negative output from A3. The negative output from Al being also directed to the inverting input of amplifier A2 will provide a positive output therefrom. As hereinbefore described, the higher the positive level at the input terminal of one shot device 29, the greater will be the output pulse widths from pin 9.Also as hereinbefore described, a positive output at amplifier A2 turns the transistor Q1 ON and the transistor Q3 OFF which enables transistor Q5 to be turned ON by the modulated pulses from the output of the one shot 29. The modulated output at the collector of Q6 modulates current to the motor 17.The servo motor provides an output torque in direct relation to the width of the one shot pulses. The servo motor drives the turret 11 in azimuth, and the tachometer 27 provides an output therefrom which is coupled to an input on the differential amplifier Al. The output from amplifier Al therefore defines an error signal ev, which is at the proper level to obtain the rotational velocity of the turret 11 about the azimuth axis in accordance with the level of the input command signal selected from the potentiometer R3. It will be seen that the motor current is directed through the servo motor 17 in the opposite direction for counterclockwise rotation by selecting a position for the movable contact on potentiometer R3 which is negative with respect to the common centre tap.As stated hereinbefore the elevation control channel circuitry is constructed in a similar manner to the azimuth control channel circuitry just described. When a torque of an external origin is exerted on the turret 11 around the azimuth axis, as for example due to recoil from a gun 12 offset from the rotational axis, the velocity signal from tachometer 27 will alter as the velocity of the turret 11 is altered by this spurious torque. It should be borne in mind, as previously stated, that a predetermined maximum signal level at the output of differential amplifier Al corresponding to a maximum slew selection at azimuth command device 23 will cause amplifiers A2 and A3 to saturate, thereby providing maximum output torque in the appropriate direction from servo motor 17. The servo motor in use provides maximum output torque of approximately 1358.8 N m at the azimuth ring gear 13.However, as previously stated, a typically mounted offcentre 20 millimeter weapon mounted in the turret 11 will impart approximately 815208 N m of torque at the azimuth ring gear due to the weapon recoil. If this spurious torque due to recoil is either added or subtracted to the torque generated by torque motor 17 due to an input command signal, the resultant may greatly exceed the servo motor maximum output torque. The polar moment of inertia about the azimuth axis in a typical installation has been measured as approximately 543 kg.m2 and the drive train inertia with the single drive gear has been measured at approximately 0.0027 kg.m2.Since the gear ratio for the azimuth drive is 45 to 1, in this example, the reflected drive train inertia about the azimuth axis, which is a function of the product of the drive train inertia and the square of the gear 2 ratio, will appear as approximately 5.5 kg.m2 at the turret. The turret polar moment of inertia is thus approximately two orders of magnitude greater than the reflected drive train polar moment of inertia. This suggests that spurious externally applied torques around the azimuth axis could over drive or back drive the servo motor 17 and the tachometer 27 if applied for a sufficiently long time.Spurious torques due to weapon recoil are relatively short lived however, since the weapon is designed to fire at relatively high rates, for example 200 rounds per minute However, the momentary changes in the velocity of the turret about the azimuthaxis when the weapon is being fired may be large due to the relatively small reflected drive train inertia and the high recoil torque levels. Consequently, the velocity output signal from the tachometer 27 may show a relatively large change. Externally applied recoil torques of the magnitude recited herein therefore produce an output from differential amplifier Al which is greatly in excess of the maximum signal level which saturates the amplifiers A2 and A3 so that maximum output torque produced by the servo motor 17 will not be sufficient to cause the system to track. With reference to the timing diagram of Figure 4 a further explanation of the transient conditions induced by the application of external torques will now be given.When a spurious torque is applied it is assumed that the input command signal is at common zero reference level and the system is at rest at the time indicated as tO An external torque such as from an offcentre fired weapon it the turret, is applied about the azimuth axis which causes tachometer 27 to produce a velocity signal.This velocity signal is large because the external torque applied is large in comparison to the maximum torque which may be supplied by the servomotor. The high external torque momentarily drives the servomotor and tachometer 27 to produce a high angular velocity output level because of the low reflected inertia of the azimuth drive train. Therefore, the signals at the differential inputs to amplifier Al are such that the error signal ev output from Al, seen at 34 in Figure 4, almost immediately exceeds the level V1 at which amplifiers A2 and A3 are saturated. The torque motor thus produces maximum torque, as seen at 36 Fig.4 , to arrest the velocity induced by the spurious torque.This begins to cause the error velocity, shown at 37, which has initially jumped to a high level, to begin to decrease. The large transient difference signal at the input to amplifier Al is integrated by the feedback circuit arrangement of Al and capacitor C2 so that the output 34 Fig.4 continues to increase towards the level V. Since motor torquf 36 has attained its maximum at about V1 output from Al, the system is not tracking. However, maximum torque in the same sense is sustained by the integrated ev 34 in Fig.4 at the output of Al causing the turret velocity due to the spurious torque to be zeroed at time tl and reversed.It will be noted though that the error signal ev output of Al is still well above V1 at this time tl due to the storage capacity of the integrating feedback capacitor C2 even though the signals from input resistorR3 and tachometer 27 are both zero. At time t2 Al output falls below V1 and the torque from motor 17 falls below maximum. At time t3 the integrated output from Al stored by capacitor C2 falls to zero level, and the reverse velocity signal from tachometer 27 causes Al output to reverse polarity to provide a torque from servo motor 17 in the opposite sense. Thus, at time t3 the velocity of the turret is seen to decrease, under the influence of the reversed torque, so that it will begin to return towards zero angular rate. At t4 the turret is repositioned substantially to the same angular position it occupied at t0.This may be seen by the equivalency in the areas under the velocity curve 37 from t0 to tl and from tl to t5. In this example t4 t0 is about 150 milliseconds. This conforms to the 200 round per minute firing rate mentioned heretofore, wherein approximately 300 milliseconds elapse between successive rounds fired. The turret is repositioned by the shot return feature described after a round is fired and well before the next round is fired By way of further example, if a motion for turret 11 is selected at the azimuth command device 23, the system will be tracking and the output from amplifierAl will be relatively small and nearly steady state so that amplifier Al will be acting as an operational amplifier with a gain in the ratio of R7 to R4 R5. When the azimuth command corresponds to a positive signal with respect to common at the sliding contact on resistor R3 i.e., clockwise rotation , an externally applied clockwise torque would produce a larger signal of the same sense from the tachometer 27. This would clearly reverse the polarity of the output at differential amplifier Al error signal ev , store the integral of the reversed polarity signal over the time the external torque was applied, and as heretofore described cause the servo motor 17 to reposition the turret 11 a corresponding angular displacement behind that position to which it was urged by the external torque.In the same fashion, an external torque which was applied in the counterclockwise sense would clearly provide an output from differential amplifier Al which would be in the same sense as that provided by the input command from R3 generating the slewing in azimuth. AmplifiersA3 and A3 would be saturated, one of them commanding maximum output torque from the servo motor 17, and the integral of the output from the amplifier Al over the period of time during which the external torque was applied would subsequently be processed by the circuit of Figure 3 to urge the servo motor to slew in the direction of motion to remove the position effect of the external torque and to resume the angular position in accordance with the input command singal from the azimuth command device 23. In the embodiment described herein, the polar moment of inertia of the weapon 12 about the elevation axis for the weapon is approximately 68 kg.mê. The drive train inertia for the elevation axis is substan tially the same as that for the azimuth axis, being approximately 0.0027 kg.m2. The drive gear ratio between the elevation drive gear 19 and the arc gear 18 is 25 to 1 for this example. Therefore, the reflected drive train inertia on the elevation axis, being the product of the drive train inertia and the square of the gear ratio , is approximately 1.7 kg.m2. The ratio of the elevation rotatable member polar moment of inertia to the reflected elevation drive train inertia is therefore approximately 40 to 1. As described hereinbefore, the ratio of azimuth to azimuth drive train inertia has been found to be approximately 100 to 1. Thus, while the inertia of the rotatable member about the azimuth axis is about two orders of magnitude greater than the reflected aximuth drive train inertia, the inertia of the rotatable member about the elevation axis is more than one order of magnitude greater than the reflected elevation drive train inertia.
