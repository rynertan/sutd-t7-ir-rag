# Electrical cable protector.

## Abstract
A rack mounted drawer for functioning electrical equip ment has cables extending from the back thereof and downwardly behind the rack framework. When the drawer is opened or closed the extending cables are dragged abrasive ly over the rack back, and may additionally be folded, pinched and crimped between the drawer and rack when the drawer is closed. The invention comprises an apron of resilient coiled sheet material attached to the back of the drawer with the coiled portions draped downwardly and behind the rack, so that upon opening of the drawer, the sheet uncoils over the rack edge and takes the abrasion in place of the cables. The sheet resiliently recoils when the drawer is closed to prevent pinching of the cables.
