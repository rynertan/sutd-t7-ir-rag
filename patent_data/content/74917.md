# Cam driven rotary pick and place assembly apparatus.

## Abstract
A cam driven apparatus 20 for providing linear transla tion as well as rotary movement to a support member 84 comprises a gripping mechanism 86 , a housing 22 , a motor driven input shaft 30 carrying two drive cams 38 , a follower wheel assembly 54 rotatably journaled on said housing 22 and drivably oscillated by one of the drive cams 38 , a main guide shaft 78 and a secondary guide shaft 80 slidably received within the follower wheel 56 the support member 84 mounted atop the guide shafts 78,80 , a connector plate 112 joining the lower ends of the guide shafts 78,80 and a follower wheel lift shaft assembly 94 drivably oscillated by the other of the drive cams. The oscillated lift shaft assembly 94 is operatively connected to the connector plate 112 and guide shafts 78,80 by a toggle linkage assembly 110 , which assembly permits simul taneous rotational and linear oscillation of the guide shafts 78,80 .
