# Method for improved non high density lipoprotein precipitation, reagent therefor and tablet comprising the reagent.

## Abstract
A reagent, of the type comprising a precipitator capable of precipitating low density lipoproteins, very low density lipo proteins, and other non high density lipoproteins, is im proved by the addition thereto of a non interfering suitable agent capable of enhancing the flocculation of a precipitant formed by the precipitator and the various non high density lipoprotein fractions in highly lipemic serum.
