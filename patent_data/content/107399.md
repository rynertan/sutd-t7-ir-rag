## Description
IMPROVED PROCESS FOR THE PREPAPaTION OF CARBOFURA1i This invention relates, in general, to an improved process fos the preparation of carbofuran and to certain intermediate products. In one aspect this invention is directed to a simple, two step process for preparing carbofuran phenol from relatively inexpensive materials. In a further aspect, this invention involves the alkylation of 1,2 cyclohexanedione followed by either a catalytic or non catalytic Claisen rearrangement aromatization. Carbofuran is a systemic insecticidR, acaricide, and nematicide currently manufactured and used in the United States and throughout tne world.The product can be produced by the sequential conversion of o nitrophenol to 2 beta methallyloxynitrobenzene, 2, 3 dihydro 2, 2 dimethyl 7 nitrobenzo furan, 2,3 dihydro 2, 2 dimethyl 7 benzofuranol, and finally 2, 3 dihydro 2, 2 dimethyl 7 benzofuranyl N methyl carbamate as described in U.S. A 3,320,286 which issued to FMC Corporation on May 16, 1967.However, the major disadvantages of the process are the expense and difficulty encountered in the preparation. The most current procedures for the preparation of carbofuran as disclosed in the patent literature involve the alkylation of a 2 substituted phenol or phenol per se with beta methallyl chloride, followed by a Claisen rearrangement. The product, the 7 substituted 2,3 dihydro 2, 2 dimethylbenzofuran, is then subjected to further transformations on the functional group at the 7 position in order to produce the desired benzofuranol. One process currently believed to be in use for the preparation of carbofuran is described in U.S. A 3,320,286 and involves five distinct steps. The process which involves the conversion of the aminobenzofuran to the benzofuranol via the diazonium salt is hazardous and requires special care in handling due to the potentially explosive nature of diazo salts. Thus, prior to tne present invention, there was no simple process which utilized relatively inexpensive materials and avoided the hazards associated with diazonium salts. Accordingly, one or more of the following objects can be achieved by the practice of this invention. It is an object of this invention to provide an improved process for the preparation of carbofuran and certain novel intermediate products.Another object of this invention is to provide a process which is simple and employs readily available and inexpensive starting materials. A further object is to provide a process which utilizes 1,2 cyclohexanedione as the starting material. Another object of the invention is to provide a simple two step process for the preparation of carbofuran phenol. These and other objects will readily become apparent to those skilled in the art in the light of the teaching hereinafter set forth. The invention relates, in general, to an improved process for the preparation of carbofuran and to certain intermediate products. The process comprises alkylating 1,2 cyclohexanedione with a beta methallyl compound and subjecting the resulting product to a Claisen rearrangement aromatization to provide carbofuran phenol. Reaction of the phenol with methyl isocyanate gives the carbofuran. As indicated above, the invention is directed to an improved process for the preparation of carbofuran and to certain intermediate products.In the preferred route, 1,2 cyclohexanedione is O alkylated with beta methallyl chloride via base catalysis or O alkylated with beta methallyl alcohol via acid catalysis to give the corresponding beta methallyldiosphenol III. The process can be outlined as follows EMI3.1 The key step in the process is the rearrangement of the diosphenol III to the 3 substituted 1,2 dione I shown as the enol or the dihydrofuran derivative II EMI4.1 These intermediates are not isolated, but are further heated in the presence of an aromatization catalyst such as palladium on various supports or sulfur to yield the.benzofuranol IV EMI4.2 The benzofuranol IV is then converted to carbofuran by standard carbamoylation procedures, such as by reaction with methyl isocyanate in the presence of aEMI4.3 In addition to the diosphenol, another intermediate which is useful in the preparation of carbofuran is the corresponding ring saturated derivative of III, 2 beta methallyloxycyclohexanoneVI.This compound can be prepared, as indicated in the examples, by the reaction of cyclohexene oxide and beta methallyl alcohol followed by the oxidation of the cyclohexanol to the cyclohexanone EMI4.4 EMI5.1 Aromatization and rearrangement of VI also results in the benzofuranol IV. In practice, the process provides a simple, inexpensive route to carbofuran phenol and carbofuran itself. Moreover, the formation of hazardous intermediates is avoided and the method utilizes relatively inexpensive starting materials and simple chemistry. As indicated above, the 2 beta methallyloxy 2 cyclohexen l one III , which is a novel compound, can undergo cyclization aromatization to form the carbofuran phenol IV. Mechanistically, the beta methallyloxy 2 cyclohexen l one can undergo theClaisen rearrangement to yield the diosphenol, aromatize, and cyclize onto oxygen or cyclize first to yield the dihydrofuran derivative II, followed by aromatization to yield the desired phenol. As previously indicated, the first step in the process of this invention is the acid catalyzed or base catalyzed alkylation of cyclohexanedione at an oxygen or ring carbon atom. The technique is well known and disclosed in GB A 1,258,554 which issued April 2, 1970 to Bayer A.G. and also reported by M.S. Gibson, J. Chem. Soc. 1962 681.In the present invention beta methallyl alcohol or a beta methallyl halide, depending upon the catalyst used, is employed as the alkylating agent. Reaction conditions and ratio of reactants are not necessarily critical and the process can be carried out under a variety of conditions. A variety of acid and base alkylation catalysts can be used and the particular choice may depend upon economic reasons or other considerations. Catalysts which have been employed successfully in this invention include, among others, the acidic alkylation catalysts such as p toluenesulfonic acid, and boron trifluoride. In the second step, the diosphenol III undergoes the Claisen rearrangement and upon further heating in the presence of an aromatization catalyst, the intermediates formed undergo aromatization to the benzofuranol. the Claisen rearrangement of enol or phenol allyl ethers is known. Additionally, the Claisen rearrangement of 2 allyl oxy 2 cyclohexen l one to yield the 3 allyl 1,2 cyclohexanedione has been reported in the literature. However, the cyclization aromatization of the novel compound 2 beta methallyloxy 2 cyclohexen l one was not heretofore known. It has been observed that in the absence of an aromatization catalyst, that is conducting the second step by heating alone, only small amounts of the benzofuranol IV is formed. Accordingly, to obtain sufficient yields of the desired phenol compound the use of a catalyst is preferred. Although palladium and sulfur were used in the examples, any catalyst which is known to effect aromatization and which would otherwise not adversely affect the reactants or product can be used. Illustrative of other catalysts which can be employed, include, but are not limited to copper, chromium, selenium, nickel, and platinum, and in general any noble metal catalyst and combinations thereof such as nickel copper chromite. The temperatures employed in the second step are not necessarily critical and can vary over a wide range depending upon the reaction period.All that is necessary is that the desired rearrangement and aromatization be achieved. In practice it has been found that temperatures of from 1500C to 35O0C, and preferably from 150 C and 250 C were satisfactory to effect the desired reaction.Temperatures above and below this range can be employed but are less preferred. The reaction time in which to effect rearrangement and aromatization can vary. However, reaction periods of up to about 1 8 hours have been found to be satisfactory. As indicated, once the benzofuranol carbofuran phenol is obtained it can be converted to carbofuran by standard carbamoylation procedures known in the art. By reacting benzofuranol with methylisocyanate in the presence of a tertiary amine catalyst, excellent yields of tne desired carbofuran are obtained. The following examples illustrate the best mode presently contemplated for the practice of this invention EXAMPLE 1 SYNTHESIS OF 0 AND C BETA METHALLYL ALKYLATED 1, 2 CYCWHEXANEDIONE VIA BASE CATALYSIS To a 500 ml 3 neck round bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, reflux condenser,N2 inlet, and addition funnel were added, 1,2 cyclohexanedione 7.50 g 67.00 mmol 8 acetone 250 ml , potassium carbonate 27.62 g 200 mmol and potassium iodide 20.00 g 120 mmol .
