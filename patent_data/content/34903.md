# Resource allocation system.

## Abstract
Store group circuits 102a, b, c or 202a, b, c in fixed priority resource allocation arrangements eliminate lockouts and reduced delays for devices 101a, b, c requesting access to a snared resource such as a data bus. The store group circuit stores 111 or 205 1 through 205 3 all access requests REQA, REQB, REQC from the devices present at a time instant, inhibits 110 or 210 storage of subsequent requests until each device associated with a stored request is granted access GRANTA, GRANTB, GRANTC , and removes from storage each request associated with a device which has been granted access. Arbitration is performed among the stored requests using exisiting arbiters 103 in the fixed priority bus allocation arrangement. Bus access is guaranteed for devices whose requests are stored in the store group circuit thereby eliminating lockouts.
