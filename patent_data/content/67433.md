# Horizontal continuous casting installation.

## Abstract
A horizontal continuous casting installation wherein a body of molten metal 12 stored in a tundish 1 is continuously fed through a tundish nozzle 14 connected to the tundish near its bottom and extending horizontally to a mold 3 connected to the forward end of the tundish nozzle coaxially therewith, to perform casting by the mold to produce a strand 4 continuously withdrawn horizontally from the mold. An electromagnetic field generating device 18 is arranged in the vicinity of the tundish nozzle and mold in a manner to enclose same, to generate an electromagnetic force oriented toward the center of a body of molten metal flowing through the boundary and exerted on the body of molten metal. The electromagnetic field generating device is constructed such that a magnetic flux of higher density is generated in a lower portion of the body of molten metal than in an upper portion thereof.
