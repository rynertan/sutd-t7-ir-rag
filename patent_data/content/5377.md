# Dental handpiece and oscillating circuit for driving a transducer assembly.

## Abstract
A dental handpiece is disclosed with a transducer assembly for holding a work tool which is caused to vibrate at substantially a resonant frequency by a variable frequency oscillator 20 . The oscillator 20 sweeps through a spectrum of frequencies under control of oscillator control means 24 . A maximum in the current flow through the transducer assembly occurs at a resonant frequency and is detected by maximum detecting means 22 which then generates a latch signal to stop the oscillator at substantially that resonant frequency. Hence the oscillator is correlated to the resonant frequency of the assembly, and subsequent changes in the loading conditions on the assembly do not affect the oscillator frequency.

## Description
DENTAL HAND PIERCE The present invention relates to a dental handpiece wherein a dental work tool held by a transducer assembly is caused to vibrate by application of an electrical signal from e variable frequency oscillator. Th, frequency of vibration of the tool is controlled by oscillator control means. As is nown such dental hand pieces work most efficiently, i.e. maximum vibration amplitude is obtained, wnen the vibration frequency is at the resonant frequency of the hand piece. Therefore in order to obtain the optimum amplitude of vibration, the frequency of the electrical oscillations within the transducer assembly must be correlated to the natural frequency of vibration of the mechanical portion of the system, i.e. of the hand piece. Known ways of effecting such correlation include flat described in U.S. Patent No 2897578 which provided for the adjustment of the frequency of the oscillator either manually by an operator, or automatically uncer the control of a feedback signal which varies witn the impedance of the transducer assembly, or in accordance sni.h a feedback signal obtained from a pickup such as a piezo electrlc crystal which is coupled to the vibration dental work tool. Another way is described in U.S.Patent No 3629726 which discloses an oscillator an an oscillator control means wherein a feedback voltage corresponding to the difference between the current through the transducer and the voltage across the transducer is utilised. The oscillator control means receives feedback signals which are representative of both the voltaae across and the current through the transducer coil drivingiand the two feedback signals are combined vectorially to lock the oscillator frequency to the resonant frequency of the transducer. These known systems continually compensate for oscillator frequency shifts and changes in the loading of the transducer assembly, for example as occurs when the dental work tool is applied to a tooth, and can consequently cause damage to teeth being treated by exerting excessive pressure. Additional circuits are therefore often used to limit the current supplied to the transducer under loaded conditions. According to the present there is provided a dental handpiece wherein the oscillator control means is arranged to sweep the oscillator through a sectr of frequencies and wherein there is provided means for detecting a maximum in the current flow in the transducer assembly as the oscillator sweeps to generate a late signal stopping the oscillator at substantially the frequency producing the detected maximum current floury through the transducer assembly. This frequency is substantially a resonant frequency of the assembly. It can be ser that a dental handpiece according to the present invention automatically finds te natural frequency of vibration of a transduce assembly hol a dental work tool, and locks the oscillator onto that frequency. A handpiece according to the present invention is particularly advantageous because retuning occurs each time the handpiece is used. This compensates for variations in the mechanical characteristics of the vibrating assembly and tne dental tool, for example those which develop with use of the handpiece, or which exis for different tools. The handpiece may therefore be used a 2 wide variety of dental tools having very different resonant frequencies. A dental handpiece according to the present invention can be constructed to avoid the need for additional current limiting circuits. By virtue of the latch signal subsequent changes in the loading conditions on the transducer assembly do not affect the oscillator frequency. One embodiment of the present invention will now be deseribed in deteil below with reference to the accomsanying drawings, in which FIGURE 1 is a schematic representation of an lestrical circuit for driving a transducer assembly of a dental handniece ccording to the bresent inventions FIGURE is a graph showing the relationsaip between the current flow throulgh and the oscillator frequency applied to the transducer assembly of a dental nand iece according to the present invention. Fioure 1 is a schematic representation of an electrical circuit for driving a transducer assembly of a dental bandpiece according to the invention at essentially a resonant frequency of the transducer assembly. The circuit is generally shown to comprise a varibale frequency oscillator 20 which operates through an out ut amplifier 14 to produce an elternating signal in a driving coil 12 of the handpiece. The frequency of the oscillator is controlled by a control signal prodused by oscillator control means In the for of an integrator buffer 14, as destribed in more detail below. The system cycle is initiated with the astivation by the dentist of a foot swite 11 asseciated with the power supoly 10. A voltage Vb sets a logic switch 19 to produce a start signal 310. The integrator buffer 24 to is te responsive to the start signal 310 produce a generally ramp shaped control signal 416 which sweeps the oscillator 20 through a plurality of frequencies.A processor 22 monItors the current flow through the coil 12 to produce a stop signal when the oscillator is sweeping through the resonant frequency. The sto signal resets the logic switch 18 to hold the buffer 24 at the appropriate control signal value. Figure 2 is a graph showing, by line 204,the relationship between the coil 12 current and the oscillator frequency. It can be seen that the voltage across sensing resistor R2, and therefore the current through the coil 1 , increases to a maximum value at a resonant frequency FR and then decreases as the frequency is varied past the resonant frequency. The processor is responsive to the eversal in the diroction of flo of the current throuoh the coil 12 which occurs as the oscillator sweeps through the resonant frequency c,, The circuitry of Figure 1 will now be dessribed in more detail.Oscillator 20 is a monolithic timing circuit comprising two separate timers 5,0 and 512 which operate in an astable mode. The timer 510 functions as the basic oscillator and as c frequency which is determined by the values of resistors R17 and R18 and capacitors C15 and C1s. The timer 510 includes a VCo Voltage Controlled Oscillator input terminal which connected to capacitor C14 and resistor R16. The val e of resistor R16 determines the operating frequency r of the VCo system. Capacitors 014 and C13 bypass high frequency noise. one output of timer 510 15 fei to timer 512 which forms another astable oscillator with resistors R19 and R20 and capacitor C17 determining the duty cycle of the output signal delivered through resIstor R21 to an output amplifier 14. In this disclosed embodiment, the oscillator 20 provides an astable VCO oscillator frequency having a variable duty cycle. The timer 512 ma also be a monostable multivibrator triggered b astable oscillator 510. The output amplifier 14 preferably comprises e. Darlington pair of transistors Q1. The variable duty cycle waveform from oscillator 20 is applied to the base of the Darlington pair Q1 causing it to saturate and draw current through the handpiece coil 12. P damping resistor 28 and a diode D4 are coupled in parallel with the hand pierce coil in the collector circuit of theDarlington pair Q1. A resistor R23, located in the embitter circuit of the Darlington pair 01. produces 2 voltage 204 which is representative of the current flow through the handpiece coil 12. . Processor 22 senses tis voltage 204. The processor 22 comprises a non inverting amplifier 202, a peak detector 202b and a comparator 202c. Voltage 204 is initially a composite AC and DO voltage and is filtered b capacitor C5. The remaining average DC voltage is applied to the non inverting input of amplifier 2022. The gain of amplifier 202a is determined by the values of resistors R1 and R3, as known in the art. Amplified DC voltage 203 is applied to an input of the peak detector 202b and, simultaneously, to te inverting input terminal of the comparator 202c via a resistor R4. The peak detector 202b orates as an ideal diode with a capacitor C6 storing a DO voltage which increases until it is equal to the peak value of the voltage 203. This maximum value is applied to the non inverting Input of the comparator 202c whose inverting input is supplied with the instantaneous value of the voltage 2G3 as indicated above. A small positive voltage from the resistor R6 provides a turn on threshold for the comparator 202c.As the oscillator 20 sweeps towards the resonant frequency of the transducer assembly both the inverting and non inverting comparator inputs will follow the rising value of the signal 303 as t oil current increases. The magnitude of the coil current reaches 2 pek at the transducer resonant frequency, so tat a further change in oscillator frequency reduces the current level and, accordingly, the value of the voltage 203. The capacitor C6 is left in a charged state at a level corresponding to the maximum level of signal 203 and is bled off at a time constant determined by the value of the capacitor C6 and of resistor R5. The comparator 202c is held in an OFF condition until the voltage from the peak detector 202b exceeds the voltage applied to the inverting terminal, when it turns ON and propogatesa pulse through the capacitor C7 to the input of logic switch 18. The logic switch 18 comprises four 2 inputCOS MOS NAND gates 302, 304, 306 and 308. Gates 334 and 308 are connected to form a flip flop, while gates 232 and 306 are used as inverters. The truth table for NAND gates is INPUT OUTPUT 00 1 01 1 10 1 11 G The correct initialization of the flip flop is guaranteed by a two step process when power is applied to the system.Owing to the initially uncharged state of capacitor C8 the initial transient state of the gates is 302 304 In Out Out O 0 d 306 308 In Out Out 0 1 1 and the second, and stable, condition is 302 304 In Out Out 0 306 308 In Out Out 0 1 0 When the foot switch 112 is closed voltage Vb is applied to the input of gate 306 resulting in logic states of 302 304 In Out Out 0 1 0 306 308 In Out Out , As described in more detail below, the integrator buffer 24 consequently integratesuntil stop1, signal ror the processor 22 signifies that the resonant frequency of the transducer has been attained.The stop signal causes the flip flop to shift in a two stop process as shown below, causing the integrator to hold its output level. TRANSIENT STABLE 302 304 302 304 In Out Out In Out Out 1 0 1 0 1 1 306 308 306 308 In Out Out In Out Out 1 0 0 1 0 The integrator buffer 24 comprises an Intecrator amplifier 408 whicn integrates the signal 310 from the logic switch 18. The charging current of integrator capacitor C10 is proportional to the current flowing In input resistor R11. The output voltage 410 from the integrator 408 is proportional to the voltage across the capacitor 010. Resistors R12 and R15 form a voltage divider which produces a reference starting voltage at one input of the integrator 408.Buffer amplifier 412 is coupled to the output of the integrator 408 as a voltage follower to isolate the input signal to oscillator 2 from the discharge current of capacitor C10. ResistorsR13 and R14 form a voltage null network which cancels input offset voltages caused by the logic switch 18.During the system cycle the capacitor C10 will therefore not charge or discharge after the integration period.Release of the footswitch 12 at the end of the cycle deactivates the relay 16, to discharge the capacitor C10 through normally closed contact 414. an In operation, the application of AC line voltage to the system of Figure 1 produces a DC voltage VA at the driving coil 12. The Darlington pair Q1 of the output amplifier 44 does not conduct however because the oscillator signal is not applied to the base of theDarlington pair 1 until footswitch 112, associated with the power supply 1J, is closed. Prior to the closing of the footswitch, D voltage VD is applied to the processor 22 and the inteorator buffer 24, and through the voltage divider network of R15 and R12, to the logic switch 18. The output of the logic switch 18 is at the sarre potential as its supply voltage, which is derived from the voltage divider network of resistors R15 and R12. The potential across the input of the integrator amplifier 403 is therefore zero and no cnarglng curre is applied to the capacitor C10. The switch 4 L, shunt no the integrator capacitor ClO, isa normally closed contact of a relay 15 coupled between the footswitcn 112 and a reference potential such as earth. Accordingly, capacitor C10 is shunted by switch 414 until the closing of the footswitch 112. The closing of the footswitch 112 applies a voltage to a water solenoid 110 and a voltage regulator 105 of the power supply 10. The output from the voltage regulator 106 is applied across a diode D2 of the oscillator 20, which in turn applies alternating input current to the base of the Darlington pair Q1. At the same time, a relay 16 is energised, opening the switch 414 in the integrator buffer 24 and removing the shunt from the capacitor C10. The logic switch 18 switches the state of the flip flop combination 304, 308 causing signal 310 to go LOW and thereby inducing a current through the resistor Rli to cause the capacitor C1 D to charge upward at a substantially linear rate. The charging potential of the capacitor C10 Is coupled through the buffer amplifier 412 to form the control signal for tne oscillator 20. The control signal Increases linearlv and causes the oscillator 2 to snift frequency at the cnarge rate of the capacItor C10. The peak detector 202b of the processor 22 senses tne amplifier signal from sensing resistor R23. As the oscillator is swept past the resonant frequency of the transducer assembly, the sensed signal level starts to decrease. The maximum signal stored in the capacitor C6 is compared to the now decreasing sensed signal 203 bv the comparator 202c and the comparator is caused to change state.The output state of the comparator is transformed into a pulse by the combination of capacitorC7 and resistor R7, and the pulse changes the logic state of NAND gate 302, thereby changing the output of signal 310 cf the NAND gate 304 to a HI statue. The HI state stops the current flow into the input of the integrating amplifier 403, there maintaining the cutout voltage cf the integrating amplifier 408 and the control voltage 416 of tne oscillator , at t level which maintains tne oscillator frequency at the resonant frequency. The cycle is repeated every time the footswitch is energised, keeping the oscillator frequency at essentialls the resonant frequency of the transducer assembly.
