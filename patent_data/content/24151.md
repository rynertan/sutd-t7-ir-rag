# Motor speed control device for DC motor.

## Abstract
A motor speed control device for a small DC motor in which the speed of rotation of the motor is maintained stable during ambient temperature changes and changes in the load applied to the motor. A temperature compensation resistor Rt is coupled in series with a voltage divider circuit Ra, Rb and the combination thereof coupled across the motor M. A motor control circuit 10 is provided having first through fourth control terminsl. The first control terminal is coupled to the junction between the temperature compensation resistor Rt and the voltage divider circuit Ra, Rb the second control terminal to the voltage division point of the divider circuit, the third control terminal to the junction between the voltage divider circuit Va, Vb and the motor M, and the fourth control terminal is coupled to ground. The motor control circuit includes an error detecting circuit 10a having inputs coupled to the first and second control terminals with a voltage refer ence source Eref coupled in series with the first input terminal to the error detecting circuit. The output of the error detecting circuit drives both shunt transistors Q2 to Qm coupled bet ween the first and fourth control terminals and a drive transis tor means Q1 coupled between the first and fourth control terminals.
