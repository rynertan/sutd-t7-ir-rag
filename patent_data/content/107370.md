## Description
ZEOLITE This invention relates to a new zeolite designated zeoliteZSM 45, to a method for its preparation and to its use in catalytic conversion of organic compounds. The lattice of a crystalline zeolite, natural or synthetic, can be described as a rigid three dimensional framework of SiO4 andA104 in which the tetrahedra are cross linked by the sharing of oxygen atoms whereby the ratio of the total aluminium and. silicon atoms to oxygen atoms is L 2. The eleetrovalenca of. the tetrahedra containing aluminium is balanced by a cation, for example an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal cation. The ratio cationic valance aluminium is thus unity. One cation nay be exchanged for another in conventional manner. By means of such cation exchange it has been possible to vary the properties of a. given zeolite. Since the cationic content of a zeolite may thus be regarded as ephemeral the only significant term in its compositional formula is the ratio of lattice silicon to aluminium, usually expressed as silica alumina ratio. The Si02 A1203 ratio of a given zeolite is however often variable. For example, zeolite X can be synthesized with SiO2 A1203 ratios of from 2 to 3 zeolite Y, from 3 to about 6.In some zeolites, the upper limit of the SiO2 A1203 ratio is unbounded.ZSM 5 is one such example wherein the SiO2A1203 ratio is at least 5 and up to infinity. US A 3,941,871 discloses a zeolite made from a reaction. mixture containing no added alumina and exhibiting the X ray diffraction pattern of. zeolite ZSM 5. US A 4,061,724, 4,073,865 and 4,104,294 describe zeolites of similar alumina and metal content. Synthetic zeolites sometimes resemble naturally occurring zeolites. Zeolites ZSM 35 and ZSM 38 are, for instance, ferrieritetype zeolites. Zeolite ZK 20 US A 3,459,676 is described as being isostructural with the naturally occurring zeolite levynite. EP A 40,016 describes synthetic zeolite Nu 3 which is of the levynite type. ZSM 45 has the formula, on an anhydrous basis, in terms of mole ratios of oxides M21n0 A1203 7 8Si02 in which M is a cation of valence n and an X ray powder diffraction pattern containing the following significant lines Interplanar D Spacing A Relative Intensity, o 8.02 0.14 Strong Very Strong 5.07 0.09 Medium Strong 4.21 0.08 Medium Strong 4.01 0.07 Strong Very Strong 3.78 0.07 Medium Strong 3.11 f 0.06 Medium Strong 2.751 0.05 Medium StrongIn the as synthesised form the zeolite usually conforms to the formula, on an anhydrous basis and in terms of moles ratios of oxides 0.8 1.8 R2O 0.0 0.3 Na2O 0 0 0.5 K2O Al2O3 SiO2 wherein R is an organic cation derived from a Z hydroxyalkyl trialkylammonium compound where alkyl is composed of one or two carbon atoms and x is greater than 8, usually from 8 to 100, and shows theX ray diffraction pattern of Table 1 hereinbelow. The original alkali metal cations of the as synthesizedZSM 45 can be replaced in accordance with techniques well known in the art, at least in part, by ion exchange with other cations. Preferred replacing cations include metal ions, hydrogen ions, hydrogen precursor, e.g. ammonium, ions and mixtures thereof. Particularly preferred cations are those which render the ZSM 45 catalytically active, especially for hydrocarbon conversion. These include hydrogen, rare earth metals and metals of Groups IA, IIA, IIIA, IVA, IB, IIB, IIIB, IVB and VIII of the Periodic Table of the Elements. Typical ion exchange technique would be to contact the synthetic ZSM 45 with a salt of the desired replacing cation or cations. Examples of such salts include the halides, e.g. chlorides, nitrates and sulfates. The 2 Hydroxyalkyl trialkylammonium compounds providing the organic cation, i.e. R, in the synthesized form of zeolite ZSM 45 may be the hydroxide or halide, e.g. chloride, compounds. The compound 2 hydroxyethyl trimethylammonium chloride is known as choline chloride, a preferred source of the organic cations. Zeolite ZSM 45 has an X ray diffraction pattern which distinguishes it from other zeolites and has the following characteristic lines TABLE IInterplanar 0 Spacing A Relative Intensity, I Io 10.16 0.18 Weak 8.02 0.14 Strong Very Strong 7.56 0.14 Weak 6.55 0.12 Mrdium Very Strong 5.66 0.10 Weak 5.50 0.10 Weak 5.07 0.09 Medium Strong 4.95 0.09 Weak 4.21 0.08 Medium Stromg 3.78 0.07 Strong Very Strong 3.60 0.06 Medium Strong 3.54 0.06 Weak 3.42 0.06 Weak Medium 3.27 0.06 Weak 3.11 0.06 Medium 3.03 0.05 Medium Strong 2.812 0.05 Weak 2.751 0.05 Weak 2.583 0.05 Medium Strong 2.535 0.05 Weak 2.521 0.05 Weak 2.475 0.04 Weak 2.405 0.04 Weak 2.362 0.04 Weak 2.251 0.04 Weak 2.181 0.04 Weak 2.133 0.04 Weak 2.097 0.04 Weak 2.029 0.04 Weak 2.006 0.03 Weak 1.889 0.03 Weak 1.859 0.03 Weak 1.843 0.03 Weak 1.815 0.03 Weak 1.765 0.03 Weak 1.721 0.03 Weak 1.710 0.03 Weak 1.650 0.03 Weak 1.637 0.03 Weak 1.617 0.03 Weak 1.606 0.03 Weak 1.559 0.03 Weak 1.559 0.03 Weak These values were determined by standard techniques The radiation was the K alpha doublet of copper and a diffractometer equipped with a scintilation counter and an associated computer was used. The peak heights, I, and the positions as a function of Z theta, where theta is the Bragg angle, were determined usfng algorithms on the computer associated with the spectrometer.From these, the relative intensities, 100 I I0, where to is the intensity of the strongest line or peak, and d obs. the interplanar spacing in Angstrom units A , corresponding to the recorded lines, were determined In Table 1, the relative Intensities are given in terms of the strongest line being taken as 100.0.

Other minor variations can occur, depending on the silicon to aluminium ratio of. the particular sample, as wetT as fts degree of thermal treatment The new zeolite ZSM 45 sorbs significant amounts of commonly used test adsorbate materials, i.e. cyclohexane, n hexane and water, whereas naturally occurring levynite is not expected to adsorb cyclohexane due to its pore structure. Sorption capacities for zeolite ZSM 45 will range at room temperature as followsAdsorbate Capacity, Wt. Percent Cyclohexane 2.2 7.0 n Hexane 7.3 12.9Water 14.5 22.S The zeolite. of the present invention can be used either in the alkali metal form, e.g. the sodium or potassium form the amnonium form, the hydrogen form or another univalent or multivalent cationic form.When used as a catalyst the zeolite will be subjected to thermal treatment to remove part or all of the organic constituent The zeolite can also be used as d cata lyst in Intimate combinatfon with a hydrogenating component such as tungsten, vanadium, molybdenum, rhenium, nickel, cobalt, chromium, manganese, or a noble metal such as platinum or palladfum where a hydrogenationdehydrogenation function fs to be performed Such. component can be exchanged into the composition to the extent alumina is in the structure, impregnated therein or intomately phisically admixed therewith.Such component can be impregnated in or on to it such as for example, by, fn the case of platinum, treating the zeolite with a solution containing a platinum metal containing ion. Thus, suitable platinum compounds include chloroplatinic acid, platinous chloride and various compounds containing the platinum amine complex. Zeolite ZSM 45, especially in its metal, hydrogen and ammonium forms can be beneficially converted t another fonu by thermal treatment. Thfs thermat treatment ts generally performed by heating one of these forms at a temperature of at least 370 C for at least I minute and generally not longer than 20 hours.. While subatmospheric pressure can be employed. for the thermal treatment , atmospheric pressure is desired for reasons of convenience The thermal treatment can be performed at a temperature up to about 925 C. The thermally treated product is particullary useful in the catalysis of certain hydrocarbon conversion reactions. The zeoli te, when employed etther as at adsorbent or as a catalyst in an organic compound conversion process should be dehydrated, at least partially . Thfs can be done by heating to a temperature in the range of 200 C to 595 C in an inert atmosphere, such as air, nitrogen, etc and at atmospheric, subatmospheric or superatmospheric pressures for between 30 minutes and 48 hours.Dehydration can aTsa be performed at room temperature merely by placing ZSM 45 in b vacuum, but a longer time is required to obtain a sufficient amount of dehydration. The new zeolite can be prepared from a reaction mixture containing sources. of alkali, metal ions M , an oxide of aluminum, an oxide of silicon, an organic cation R derived from a 2 hydroxyalkyl trialkylammonium compound wherein alkyl is composed of of one or two carbon atoms and water and having a composition, in terms of mole ratios of oxides, falling within the following ranges Reactants Useful Preferred SiO2 Al2O3 10 150 15 80 OH SiO2 0.3 1.0 0.3 0.8 H20 OH 20 100 20 80 R R M 0.1 0.8 0.2 0.7 K K Na 0.0 0.8 0.05 0.3 wherein R and M are as above defined.

Thereafter, the crystals are separated from the liquid and recovered The composition can be prepared utilizing materials which supply the appropriate oxides.Such compositions may include sodium silicate, silica hydrosol, silica gel, silicic acid, sodium hydroxide, a source. of aluminums and. an appropriate organic compound It should de realozed that the reaction mixture component oxides can be supplied from more than one source. The reaction mixture can be prepared either batchwfse or continuously. Crystal size and crystalisation time of the new crystaline zeolite ZSN 45 will vary with the nature of the reaction mixture employed and the crystallization conditions. In all cases, synthesis of the ZSM.45 crystals is facilitated by the presence of at least 0.01 percent, preferably 0.10 percent and still more preferably 1 percent, seed crystais based on total weight of crystalline product. The 2 hydroxyalkyl trialkylammonium compound may be the hydroxide or halide, e.g . chloride, iodize or bromide When the compound is 2 hydroyxethyl trimethylAmmonium chloride, it is called choline chloride, a preferred source af organic cations R In the synthesis of zeolite ZSM 45.

In the examples, whenever adsorption data are set forth for comparison of sorptive capacities for water, cyclohexane and or n hexane, they were determined as follows A weighed sampTe of the calcined adsorbant was contacted with the desired pure adsorbate vapor in an addsorption chamber, evacuated to 1 mm and contacted with 12 mm Hg of water vapor or 20 mm Hg of n hexaner or cyclohexane vapor, pressures less than the vapor liquid equilibrum pressure of the respective adsorbate at room temperature.The pressure was kept constant within about 0.5 mm by addition of adsorbate vapor controlled by a manostat during the adsorption period, which did not exceed about 8 hours. As adsorbate was adsorbed by the new crystal, the decrease in pressure caused the manostat to open a valve which admitted more adsorbate vapor to the chamber to restore the above control pressures Sorption was completes when the pressure change ways not sufficient to activate the manostat The increase In weight was calculated as thA adsorption capacity of the sample in g 100 g of calcined adsorbant.
