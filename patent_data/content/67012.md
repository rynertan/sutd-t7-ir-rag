## Description
COLLECTING APPARATUS PRIMARILY FOR CATCHING AND ELEVATING,FOR EXAMPLE, LIVE BIRDS IN A DEEP LITTER OR OPEN HOUSESITUATIONDESCRIPTION This invention relates to collecting apparatus primarily for catching and elevating live birds such as broilers, pullets, turkeys, and other poultry or game birds being bred in a deep litter or open house situation. As the initial step in a series of steps for example in preparing the birds for human consumption, and can be for use, also in catching or picking up and elevating rubbish from a rubbish strewn area of land as the initial step in a series of steps in cleaning said land area. According to the present invention collecting apparatus comprises a mobile supporting framework mounting two elongate rotatable members adapted to be driven counter to one another and disposed with their axes parallel to one another and to be, in use, substantially parallel to a supporting surface across which the framework is intended to be moved, the members defining therebetween a passage at the lower end of which animate or inanimate objects are caught and along which the caught objects are elevated in use of the apparatus, and means lesser in length than the passage is deep outstand from the members. Preferably, the elongate member rearward in the direction in which the framework in intended to be moved is nearer ground level than the elongate member then to the front such that the ground clearance at the forward member enables passage of an object therebelow while that at the rear member prevents such passage and ensures that the means thereon, in co operation with the means on the forward member, sweep the object or objects up into the passage between the members and elevates the object or objects to the upper end of the passage for discharge therefrom to the next step in t he series lso, the two elongate rotatable ffixre aw two rollers. Altw natively, the two elongate rotatable memberS are lower terminal rollers of two endless conveyors, disposed with upwardly directed or upwardly inclined runs spaced and parallel to one another and definingtherebetween the elevating passage at the lower end of which objects are caught and along which the caught objects are elevated in use of the apparatus, the conveyors having the means outstanding from their endless surfaces. The two elongate members may also alternatively comprise a forward roller and a rearward lower terminal roller for a conveyor. The means may be elements in the form of strips of deformable resilient foamed material or rows of spaced resilient bristles arranged longitudinally of the rollers or transversely of the conveyors, or may be a jacket of foamed material provided around the rollers or the conveyors Embodiments of the present invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a diagrammatic plan view of a preferred collecting apparatus according to a first embodiment of the present invention and in which two conveyors are provided with upwardly directed runs Fig. 2 is a diagrammatic side view of the apparatus shown in Fig 1 Fig 3 is a sectional view on the line IIIIII of Fig 1 Fig 4 is a schematic view similar to Fig 3 and showing the runs of the conveyors being upwardlyinclined and Figs 5,6 and 7 are schematic views similar to Fig 3 and showing different disposition of rotatable members according to second, third and fourth embodiments respectively of the present invention. Referring to the first embodiment as shown inFigs 1 to 3 of the drawings, collecting apparatus primarily for catching and elevating live birds comprises a mobile supporting framework mounting two elongate rotatable members whose axes are parallel, and to be, in use, substantially parallel to a supporting surface 9 across which the framework is intended to be moved. The members are formed by lower terminal rollers of two endless conveyors 10 and 11. Sides 6,7 and arms 12 and 13 of the framework are shown in the drawings. The supporting framework may be incorporated into a self propelled vehicle or may be an attachment for fitting to a self propelled vehicle. The conveyors 10, 11 are chain driven and adapted to be driven counter to one another and are of slat or belt type arranged in a series of strips spaced lengthwise of the lower and upper terminal rollers 14, 15.The conveyors 10, 11 are disposed on said arms 12, 13with upwardlydirected runs spaced and parallel to one another and defining therebetween a passage at the lower end of which birds are intended to be caught and along which caught birds are elevated in use of the apparatus. Screwadjustment to increase or decrease the depth of the passage is shown at 8. The lower terminal roller 14 of the rearward conveyor 11 in the direction in which the framework is intended to be moved is nearer the supporting surface or grollnd level 9 than the lower terminal roller 14 of conveyor 10 then to the front which is spaced at a height sufficient to enable passage of a bird thereunder, as shown in the drawings while at the rear conveyor 11 passage is prevented.The conveyors 10 and 11 are mounted on the arms 12, 13 to be spaced apart for example 25.6 cms 10 inches with conveyor 10 spaced, for example above the ground 9 The conveyors 10, 11 have outstanding from their endless surfaces resilient elements 16 lesser in length than the passage is deep. Each element 16 comprises a strip of foamedmaterial transverse of the conveyor. To assist in directing birds towards the conveyors 10, 11, two brushes 17 each rotatable about a vertical shaft 18 and driven by motor 19, are provided one on each lateral side of the framework and driven in counter rotation to each other and inwardly towards the conveyors 10, 11. Means to drive said conveyors 10, 11 and motors 19 aay be any convenient power source additional to or Zau from the motive power of the vehicle. In use, with the arms 12, 13 of the support framework forwardly of the vehicle in the direction of movement and with the conveyors 10, 11 being driven, the vehicle is moved into the house containing the birds and towards the birds to be caught. The birds pass under the conveycr 10 and the directional flow of the elements 16 serves to sweep the bird or birds clear of the ground, and thence being held firmly thereby elevated up the passage to the upper end thereof for discharge to the next step of the series of steps,and a conveyor 5 is shown in Fig. 3 for this purpose. In a modification, the conveyors 10, 11 have upwardly inclined runs as shown in Fig. 4. In a second embodiment as shown in Fig. 5 in which like numerals denote like parts, each conveyor 10, 11 has rows of elements in the form of mountings 40 having monofilaments41 outstanding therefrom. In a third embodiment as shown in Fig. 6 a simplified apparatus comprises two rollers 20, 21 mounted on a similar framework as in previous embodiments and adapted to be driven counter to one another and disposed somewhat similar to the lower terminal rollers of conveyors 10, 11. The passage is upwardly inclined and of short length and feeds on to an inclined conveyor 22 as shown. The rollers 20, 21 have outstanding from the peripheries resilient elements 16. In a fourth embodiment as shown in Fig. 7, s two rollers 30, 31 are provided, roller 30 being similar to roller 20, and roller 31 being similar to the rearward lower terminal roller 14, with conveyor 32 being arranged therearound. The elements almost meet at the mid way line of the passage as shown in the drawings apart from Fig. 5 which shows the elements overlapping. The apparatus described in the second, third and fourth embodiment is used in the same manner as the apparatus described in the first embodiment. In a modification of each embodiment, the elements 16 of one or both rollers or conveyors may be replaced by a jacket of foamed material whose depth is the same as the length of the elements. It has been found in test that catching and elevating live birds is possible without damaging or bruising to the birds, or at the least limit such bruising or damaging to a negligible or at most an acceptable level. While tbe..coliecting apparatus as described above has been primarily developed for use with live birds, it can within the scope of the present invention be used also for collecting inaminate objects, such as rubbish from a rubbish streSn field after spectators have departed at the end of a sporting event or from a beach. The choice of elements used will be determined
