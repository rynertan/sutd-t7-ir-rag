# Process gas introduction and channeling system.

## Abstract
The apparatus adapted to deposit semiconductor layers includes at least one dedicated deposition chamber 28 through which substrate material 11 is adapted to continuously travel means for introducing process gases 36 , including a semiconductor material, into each of said at least one deposition chamber 28 and means 38 for decomposing the process gases in a decomposition region formed between substrate material 11 and said decomposing means, whereby a semiconductor layer is continuously deposited onto substrate material 11 . The improvement comprises in combination channeling means 51 for directing the process gases introduction into each of the at least one deposit on chamber 28,30 to pass through the decomposition region thereof in a direction substantially parallel to the direction of travel of substrate material 11 and means 72 for introducing dopant profiling gas into the decomposition region of the deposition chamber in a direction of flow opposite the direction of flow in a direction of flow opposite the direction of flow of the process gases therethrough, whereby the profiling gas is adapted to diffuse through at least a portion of the decomposition region for depositing a substantially uniform profiled semiconductor layer onto the entire surface of substrate material.
