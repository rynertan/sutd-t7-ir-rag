# Mechanical control device of ball type valve systems.

## Abstract
A mechanical control device for ball valve type valve systems is described wherein the rotation of the ball valve 30 is achieved via the straight translation movement of a gudgeon pin 36 bound torsionally to the said ball valve 30. The gudgeon pin 36 has one, or more helical grooves 38 inside which projections 56 of a female component 40 engage. The said female component 40 is fixed to a lever 14 pivoted at 16 and moved by the operator in contrast with a fixed lever 12 arranged at a distance which permits it to be manoeuvred with only one hand. A spring 44, arranged inside the body of the female component 40 ensures the straight return movement of the said component and then the rotation of the ball valve 30 up to its closure.
