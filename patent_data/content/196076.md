# Light metal alloy piston.

## Abstract
A light metal alloy cast piston including a thermal strut 32, 48, 52 arranged in a shoulder portion of the piston skirt. The thermal strut is composed of an annular fiber rein forced metal portion in which high tensile strength reinforc ing fibers are integrally molded. The reinforcing fibers in clude first fibers 34 , such as carbon fibers, having a coeffi cient of linear expansion substantially smaller than that of the matrix metal alloy, and second fibers 36 , such as sili con carbide fibers and alumina fibers, having a flexural or bending strength larger than that of the first fibers. The first fibers primarily serve to restrain thermal expansion of the piston skirt and the second fibers, having a larger bending strength, act to protect the first fibers from excessive bend ing forces. In a preferred embodiment, the first fibers are lo cated in the inner region of the thermal strut and the second fibers are arranged in the outer region.
