# AN IMPROVED METHOD OF AND APPARATUS FOR MAKING IMPRINTED PAPER

## Abstract
An improved method of making imprinted paper on a Yankee dryer type papermaking machine wherein a substan tial length portion of a loop of imprinting fabric post wraps an arcuate sector of the Yankee dryer immediately after a pres sure roll Yankee dryer nip, and by being tensioned imposes radially inwardly acting compressive loading on a corres ponding length portion of the web disposed between the fabric and the dryer surface. This enables, for instance, improved Yankee dryer speed, improved web tension and edge control of the paper when creped off the Yankee dryer, reduced use of adhesive on the Yankee dryer surface, improved fiber transfer efficiency, and reduced energy con sumption per ton of paper made.
