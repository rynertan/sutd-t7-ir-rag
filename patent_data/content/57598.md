# Acoustic surface wave device.

## Abstract
An acoustic surface wave device comprises a piezo electric substrate 1 , an input transducer 2 , an output transducer 3 and acoustical absorbent layer patterns 5,6 for absorbing undesired acoustic surface waves and bulk waves S₄, S₅ . Each of the acoustical absorbent layer pat terns 5, 6 has zigzag shaped or triangular shaped edges, i.e., a recess portion R₁, R₃ and a protruding portion R₂, R₄ . The recess portion has a further recess portion R₁ , R₃ which is formed obliquely with respect to the propagation path of acoustic surface waves.
