# Apparatus for applying radiant beam.

## Abstract
Apparatus for applying a radiant beam against an opaque diaphragm 18 to melt an aperture in the diaphragm 18 . Bracket means 12 provided for positioning the diaphragm 18 at a predetermined position, along with a source of the ra diant beam 20 and electric circuit means 21 for activating the source 20 . Photocell means 52 may be positioned whereby a properly positioned diaphragm 18 initially shades the photocell 52 from the beam, and the beam strikes the photocell 52 when the aperture is formed. Means are pro vided to shut off the radiant beam responsive to the beam strik ing the photocell 52 . The photocell 52 may be positioned in a pivotable switch arm 4b , and the radiant beam source 20 may be a special filament type light bulb 20 with a focusing reflector 24 .
