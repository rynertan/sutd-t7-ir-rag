## Description
This invention relates to β lactam antibiotics and in particular to a salt of the penicillin antibiotic amoxycillin. The amoxycillin salt of this invention is active against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria and is useful as a therapeutic and prophylactic agent against bacterial infections in animals including man. In particular it is useful for parenteral administration. Although there are numerous known methods for the preparation of the widely used antibiotic, sodium amoxycillin, all such methods have produced an amorphous material. A process has now been devised which produces sodium amoxycillin in crystalline form. The material is anhydrous, essentially pure, non hygroscopic and has high stability. Accordingly this invention provides crystalline sodium amoxycillin. The invention also provides crystalline anhydrous sodium amoxycillin. The crystalline sodium amoxycillin of this invention is solvent free. It contains less than 2.5 of solvent, suitably less than 1 and preferably 0.5 or less solvent. The crystalline anhydrous sodium amoxycillin contains less than 2.5 of water, suitably less than 1 and preferably 0.5 or less water. The invention also provides a process for the preparation of crystalline sodium amoxycillin, which process comprises removing the solvent molecules from a crystalline solvate of sodium amoxycillin, and wherein the said removal of solvent molecules from the solvate may comprise the conversion of the solvate into a different solvate, from which the solvent molecules may be removed more readily, and subsequently removing the solvent molecules therefrom. The crystalline material of this invention is characterized by a sharp infra red spectrum and a multiple line X ray powder diffractogram. For the preparation of the product of this invention, a crystalline solvate of sodium amoxycillin is employed as starting material. The solvate may be prepared by any convenient method. In general the solvate is prepared by bringing together a sodium compound, a non aqueous solution of amoxycillin and a solvent which can form a solvate with sodium amoxycillin preferably a solvent which is labile, i.e. is readily removable from the solvate. The solvate is then precipitated from the solution, for example by precipitation with a solvent in which the solvate is insoluble. An excess of the solvating solvent itself may be sufficient to cause the precipitation. A solvate which is crystalline is preferably isolated in crystalline form by carrying out the precipitation under conditions which allow crystallization to take place. In one suitable method a solution of amoxycillin is prepared by suspending amoxycillin trihydrate in a suitable solvent or mixture of solvents and adding a strongly basic sodium compound such as sodium methoxide. A suitable solvent system for this stage is methanol or a mixture containing methanol and a solvating solvent. Sufficient solvating solvent is then added under conditions which allow crystallization of the solvate. Alternatively amoxycillin trihydrate may be dissolved with the aid of an organic base, such as triethylamine and the resultant solution treated with a sodium compound such as sodium methoxide, sodium hydroxide or preferably the sodium salt of an alkanoic acid, e.g. sodium 2 ethyl hexanoate. These steps may conveniently be combined by using a mixture of an organic base and a sodium compound to bring about dissolution of the amoxycillin trihydrate. A suitable solvent system for this stage is methanol or a mixture of methanol and solvating solvent. Sufficient solvating solvent is then added to cause crystallization of the solvate. Suitable solvents which form solvates with sodium amoxycillin include C Preferred solvating solvents are tetrahydrofuran, methyl acetate and ethyl acetate. These solvents form solvates from which the solvent molecules are readily removed. One known class of solvates of sodium amoxycillin comprises amide solvates. Such solvates are particularly stable. Amide solvates of sodium amoxycillin comprise a solvate of sodium amoxycillin with an amide. Such solvates are described in GB 1465694. A particular solvate, with the amide N methylpyrrolidinone, is described in EP 039967 A. The amide solvate may be prepared by any convenient method. Preferably a source of sodium ions is added to a mixture or solution of amoxycillin or a salt thereof and the amide. For example, amoxycillin trihydrate or amoxycillin triethylamine salt may be suspended or dissolved in the amide or a mixture of the amide and inert solvent such as methylene dichloride. This solution or suspension is then treated with at least one equivalent of a basic sodium salt, e.g. solid sodium 3 ethylhexanoate, or a solution of sodium methoxide or sodium hydroxide in an aliphatic alcohol such as methanol or isopropyl alcohol. Ambient temperatures may be used but lower temperatures 0 5 C are preferred to minimize degradation. The amides which form the amide solvate may be of formula I The term hydrocarbon includes groups having up to 18 carbon atoms, suitably up to 10 carbon atoms, conveniently up to 6 carbon atoms. Suitable hydrocarbon groups include C Suitable alkyl groups include straight and branched chain alkyl groups containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl. A particular alkyl group is methyl. A preferred aryl group is phenyl. Preferably the amide is a tertiary amide, that is both R Suitably R represents hydrogen or C Preferably R represents hydrogen or methyl. Suitably R Preferably R Alternatively R and R Suitable amides for inclusion in the amide solvate of sodium amoxycillin include dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, N methylpyrrolidin 2 one or N methylpiperidin 2 one. In the process for the preparation of the crystalline sodium amoxycillin of this invention, the solvent molecules are removed from the sodium amoxycillin solvate. This removal should be carried out under conditions which do not degrade the penicillin. The method of removal of solvent molecules depends on the nature of the solvate. For many solvates, the solvent molecules are readily removable and the solvate free crystalline anhydrous sodium amoxycillin of the invention may be prepared by conventional drying means for example in vacuum. Conveniently the solvate is exposed to an adsorbent for the solvent molecules, either with or without vacuum which adsorbent may be a conventional drying agent such as phosphorus pentoxide, calcium chloride or silica. Solvents which may be removed directly by such procedures include hydrocarbons, alkanols, ethers, chlorinated hydrocarbons and esters. An alternative method for removal of solvent molecules, which is particularly useful for stable solvates, comprises the conversion of the solvate into a different solvate, from which the solvent molecules may be removed more readily, and subsequently removing the solvent molecules therefrom by conventional drying means. The conversion is conveniently carried out by dissolving or suspending the solvate in a non aqueous solvent, such as an alkanol, or a mixture of non aqueous solvents and adding a solvating solvent in excess. This method is particularly useful for removing the amide from an amide solvate. Thus, the amide solvate of sodium amoxycillin is dissolved in a C Suitable C The sodium amoxycillin formed by the process of this invention is crystalline, usually in the form of prisms or rods. It is also anhydrous, typically containing less than 1 moisture and exhibits exceptional stability, undergoing no degradation at 80 C over a period of four hours. Unlike previously known spraydried or freeze dried amorphous sodium amoxycillin, both of which are among the most hygroscopic of penicillins, this crystalline form is non hygroscopic. The infra red spectrum Nujol Trademark mull of the crystalline sodium amoxycillin of this invention is shown in the accompanying Figure 1. The crystalline sodium amoxycillin of this invention is also characterised by an X ray powder diffractogram showing maxima within 0.1 of the values listed in Example 21 hereinafter. A further advantage of the process for production of the sodium amoxycillin is that the process incorporates a step in which sodium amoxycillin is wholly in solution, so that the solution can be sterile filtered. This operation is important for a product which is to be employed for parenteral administration. The crystalline form of the sodium amoxycillin can be reduced or removed without destroying its anhydrous nature, for example by mechanical degradation of the crystals or by dissolving in an anhydrous solvent. Similarly it is possible to retain the crystalline form of the sodium amoxycillin whilst allowing some hydration of the anhydrous state. The present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition which comprises crystalline sodium amoxycillin and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The compositions of the invention include those in a form adapted for oral, topical or parenteral use and may be used for the treatment of the infection in mammals including humans. However the chief utility of sodium amoxycillin is for parenteral use. For parenteral administration, fluid unit dosage forms are prepared utilizing the compound and a sterile vehicle, water being preferred. The compound, depending on the vehicle and concentration used, can be either suspended or dissolved in the vehicle. In preparing solutions the compound can be dissolved in water for injection and filter sterilized before filling into a suitable vial or ampoule and sealing. Advantageously, agents such as a local anaesthetic, preservative and buffering agents can be dissolved in the vehicle. Alternatively the dry powder is sealed in a vial and an accompanying vial of water for injection may be supplied to reconstitute the liquid prior to use. Parental suspensions are prepared in substantially the same manner except that the compound is suspended in the vehicle instead of being dissolved and sterilization cannot be accomplished by filtration. The compound can be sterilized by exposure to ethylene oxide before suspending in the sterile vehicle. Advantageously, a surfactant or wetting agent is included in the composition to facilitate uniform distribution of the compound. The compositions may contain from 0.1 by weight, preferably from 10 60 by weight, of the active material, depending on the method of administration. Where the composition comprises dosage units, each unit will preferably contain from 50 500 mg of the active ingredient. The dosage as employed for adult human treatment will preferably range from 100 to 3000 mg per day, for instance 1500 mg per day depending on the route and frequency of administration. Such a dosage corresponds to 1.5 to 50 mg kg per day. Suitably the dosage is from 5 to 20 mg kg per day. Advantageously, the solution for injection prepared from the crystalline sodium amoxycillin also comprises at least one water miscible pharmaceutically acceptable alcoholic compound such as ethanol, n propanol, iso propanol, ethoxyethanol, diethylene glycol, and propylene glycol. A particularly advantageous alcohol for incorporation in the injectable composition is benzyl alcohol, which is incorporated at a level of up to 10 , preferably 1 5 , suitably about 3 of the composition. It is also advantageous to incorporate a basic excipient with the crystalline sodium amoxycillin in the compositions adapted for administration by injection. In particular, this invention also provides an injectable composition comprising crystalline sodium amoxycillin and trisodium phosphate. A suitable weight ratio of the crystalline sodium amoxycillin to the trisodium phosphate is from 8 1 to 50 1, preferably from 10 1 to 30 1, especially from 14 1 to 28 1. The inclusion of a base such as trisodium phosphate is particularly desirable to obtain rapid and complete dissolution of the sodium amoxycillin in aqueous solutions of high concentration required for intramuscular injection typically 1 g of sodium amoxycillin 2 ml of water . One advantageous presentation is a twin pack consisting of a vial containing crystalline sodium amoxycillin and a separate vial containing an aqueous solution of a buffer, for example trisodium phosphate. The crystalline sodium amoxycillin may be the sole therapeutic agent in the compositions of the invention or a combination with other antibiotics or with a β lactamase inhibitor may be employed. Advantageously, the compositions also comprise a compound of formula II or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof Preferably A represents hydroxy or methoxy, i.e. compound II , preferably in the form of a salt, represents clavulanic acid or the methyl ether of clavulanic acid. A preferred composition comprises crystalline sodium amoxycillin together with a salt of clavulanic acid, in particuiar the sodium or potassium salt, preferably potassium clavulanate. A particular composition of this invention comprises crystalline sodium amoxycillin, potassium clavulanate and trisodium phosphate. A further advantageous composition comprises crystalline sodium amoxycillin together with a compound of formula III or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or The present invention also provides a method of treating bacterial infections in animals, in particular humans or domestic mammals, which comprises the administration of a composition of this invention.
