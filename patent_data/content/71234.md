# One component room temperature setting composition.

## Abstract
A one component room temperature setting composi tion having an excellent storage stability comprising a hydrolyzable silyl group containing vinyl polymer, a harden er and a stabilizer selected from a hydrolyzable ester compound and a Î² diketone compound, which may further contain a pigment and a solvent. The storage stability of the composition containing the hydrolyzable silyl group containing vinyl polymer which is crosslinkable in the presence of water to harden at room temperature, can be remarkably improved by the presence of the above stabilizer.
