# Curable resin composition and its use for preparing coatings.

## Abstract
A curable resin composition is described which comprises A a silyl group containing vinyl resin in which the main chain consists essentially of a vinyl polymer which has in its molecule at least one silicon atom connected to a hydrolyzable group on the terminal or side chain, B a tin compound, and C an amine or a mixture of two or more amines having in their mol ecule at least one silicon atom connected to a hydro lyzable group. This curable resin composition can be used in coating compositions such as paints for prepar ing coatings.
