# Digital Computer comprising input circuitry for a plurality of input lines.

## Abstract
A digital computer having a real time counter and a memory address bus uses binary input data comprising a plurality of bits of information to generate output information in response to a programme. The invention provides improved processing of the binary input data. A transition from one state to another of one or more of the bits of binary input data causes a byte of binary input data containing the bit or bits having undergone transition to be placed in an input holding register. Also, the real time at which the transition occurred is placed in a capture time holding register. The contents of the input holding and capture time holding registers are repetitively placed in a stack as pending input data bytes. The pending input data bytes are accessible to the computer central processing unit, as required by the programme, via the memory address bus.
