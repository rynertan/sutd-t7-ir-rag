# A METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MANUFACTURING A PLASTIC PIPE PART WITH SOCKET END, AS WELL AS A PIPE PART WITH SOCKET END OBTAINED IN THIS WAY

## Abstract
A plastic pipe 52 is provided with three subsequent pipe widenings 24a, 54 and 55 of increasing diameter by means of a fluid pressure striking the plastic pipe instantaneously to an outer mould 6 comprising three widenings adapted to the pipe widenings. Prior to the action of the fluid pressure a compressed sealing member 25 is accommodated in the pipe and after the formation of the pipe widenings said sealing member 25 is released, so that a head portion 56 of the sealing member engages the third widening 55. Subse quently the end portion 41 of the pipe is inwardly rebent around the head portion 56. The fluid pressure acts upon the pipe 52 near the free end of the said pipe and flows substantially parallel to the end portion 41 of the socket to be formed or perpendicularly to the transition wall 35 between second widenings 54 and third widening 55. Rebending the end portion is performed by moving a deforming member 23 by means of the fluid pressure retained after formation of the three pipe widenings 24a, 54 and 55. The apparatus for providing a plastic pipe 52 with three subsequent widenings comprises a pipe support 27 provided with an annular sealing member 26 for accommodating a sealing member 25 deformed by means of a movable cap 27. The apparatus further comprises a valve 4 which may sealingly cooperate with an inner cylinder 1. After movement of the valve 4 an annular slit 64 is formed for subjecting the pipe part to the action of a fluid pressure. The slit 64 is located near the free end 23a of deforming member 23 engaging the free end 41a of the plastic pipe.
