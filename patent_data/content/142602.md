# Microwave coupler.

## Abstract
A microwave coupled line device constructed to equalize even and odd mode delay and comprising an outer conductor and first and second inner conductors at least one of which has insulation bonded thereto and separated by the thickness of said insulation therebetween. There is also provided an insulating sleeve disposed in the outer conductor and adapted to accommodate the first and second inner conduc tors. Means are provided for filling the void between the insulating sleeve and the outer conductor with an insulating material preferrably having a dielectric constant in the range of 2.6 3.5.
