# Device and method for spinning a sample for NMR probes.

## Abstract
An air bearing sample spinner for use in an NMR probe has a first air bearing established between frustoconical mating surfaces 34, 36 of rotor 30 and stator 35 to provide levitation and rotation. A cylindrical portion 33 projects from the rotor 30 into a similar coaxial cylindrical portion of the stator 35 where a journal bearing is provided by radial jets 41 for centering of the rotor 30 in the stator housing 35 .
