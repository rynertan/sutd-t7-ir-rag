# Method and device for moving sediment.

## Abstract
Method and device for moving sediment from the bottom 10 of a waterway exposed to tidal waters. The sediment is cut loose by the discs 2 of a disc cultivator. The sediment is then lifted towards the surface 11 of the waterway by means of an airlift pump 3 .

## Claims
Claims 1. A method of moving sediment from the bottom of a waterway exposed to tidal waters, c h a r a c t e r i z e d i n that the sediment is cut loose from the bottom of the waterway during the passing out of the tide and that the cut loose sediment is lifted towards the surface of the waterway by means of an air lift pump. 2. A device for moving sediment from the bottom of a waterway exposed to tidal waters comprising means 2 for cutting loose the sediment from the bottom 10 c h a r a c t e r i z e d i n that said means comprises a disc cultivator 1,2 and that an air lift pump 3 is mounted on the disc cultivator, said air lift pump having an inlet opening 4 being directed towards the discs 2 of said disc cultivator.

## Description
Method and device for moving sedimentThe present invention relates to a method and a device for moving sediment from the bottom of a waterway exposed to tidal waters.A problem experienced in many waterways exposed to tidal waters is the accumulation of sediment. Such a waterway could for instance be an entrance canal from a river to a harbour basin. In order to allow boats to enter the basin the sediment must be removed every now and then to maintain a sufficient depth in the waterway.According to prior art rakers comprising a beam provided with a number of pins are towed over the bottom of the waterway by tugboats in order to loosen the sediment. This is done during the outgoing tide. In this way the sediment is moved a distance by the tide before resedimentation occursThis method is time consuming, and thus costly, because the sediment is moved a short distance only after each raking. Furthermore, the pins are often caught by chains, wires and other debris on the bottom.The present invention, which is defined by the appended claims, provides a more economical method in which the sediment is effectively lifted from the bottom of the waterway so that the tide will move the sediment a substantially longer distance for each passing of the tugboatThe number of passages by the tugboat can thus be considerably decreased.An example of the invention is described below with reference to the accompanying drawing in which fig 1 shows a device according to the invention from the side. Fig 2 shows the device from above sectioned according to 2 2 in fig 1.The sediment moving device shown in the figs comprises a disc cultivator comprising a frame 1 and a number of bowl shaped discs 2. The frame is provided with an air lift pump 3. The inlet opening 4 of the air lift pump is directed towards the discs 2. The outlet opening 7 of the air lift pump may be directed as shown in the drawing, in the opposite direction or upwards. The direction should be the same as the direction 12 of the outgoing tide if directed sideways. The air lift pump 3 is provided with a supply tube 5 for compressed air. Tube 5 has a number of exit holes 6 for the compressed air, which is delivered to tube 5 through a conduit 8. The device is towed below the water surface 11 on the bottom leo of the waterway by a tugboat, symbolically represented by its propeller 13. A towline 9 connects the device to the tugboat. Conduit 8 follows towline 9 to the tugboat where a compressor feeds compressed air into conduit 8.When towing the device against the outgoing tide as shown in the drawing the downstream movement of sediment is augmented by the slipstream of propeller 13.The method of the invention is performed in the following way. The device shown in the drawing is towed over the bottom 10 of the waterway during the passing out of the tide.Sediment accumulated on the bottom is cut loose by the discs2 of the disc cultivator. The cut loose sediment is then lifted towards the surface 11 by the air lift pump 3 whose pumping action is caused by the rising air bubbles introduced through the exit holes 6. The upwards waterflow, containing sediment, is then either directed in the direction 12 of the outgoing tide or let out upwards.
