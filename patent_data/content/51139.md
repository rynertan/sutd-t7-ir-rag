# Composite tubing and shielded electrical cable.

## Abstract
Tubing and electrical cable utilizing shields made from a flexible metal tape that has a coating of a copolymer of ethylene with a monomer having a reactive carboxyl group bonded to at least one of its sides and to which coating is bonded an adhesive that is adapted to bond the coating to flexible or semi rigid non olefinic polymeric materials so as to provide such tubing and electrical cable with improved flexibility and resistance to wrinkling or bending.
