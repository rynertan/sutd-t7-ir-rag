## Description
EASILY POLED 0 3 PIEZOELECTRIC COMPOSITES FOR TRANSDUCER APPLICATIONSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention is related to piezoelectric materials and, more particularly, to a 0 3 PZT poiymer composite for transducer applications and the like. Piezoelectricity can be explained as electric polarization produced by mechanical stress in certain substances. Piezoelectric materials. such as lead zirconate titanate PZT , are used in a wide variety of applications. In hydrophone devices piezoelectric materials detect low frequency acoustic waves passively. Kydrophones are frequently made from single phase PZT. Large hydrostatic piezo electric charge and voltage coefficients dh and gh are desired in these devices. Thus, even though the magnitudes of the piezoelectric coefficients dn and dlt of PZT are large, the hydrostatic coefficients dh and ghare small, because the dn and 2d3, coefficients are almost equal and opposite in sign, and also, the dielectric constant of PZT is large.The large difference of the acoustic impedance between PZT and water requires impedance matching layers for underwater hydrophone applications. In order to improve and modify material prog erties for hydrophone devices, several different types of piezoelectric PZT polymer composites have been recently investigated utilizing the concept of phase connectivity. It has been found that the electric flux pattern and the mechanical stress distribution together with the resulting physical and piezoelectric properties depend strongly on the manner in which the individual piezoelectric and polymer phases of the diphasic composites are interconnected. Each phase in a composite may be self connected in zero, one, two, or three dimensions. Thus, a diphasic 2 1 connectivity pattern, for example, has one phase self connected in two dimensional layers, the other in one dimensional chains or fibers.Below are represented some of the composites with different connectivity patterns in which the piezoelectric phase appears first.0 3 composites PZT particles suspended in a polymer matrix 1 3 composites PZT rods aligned in the poling direction held together by a polymer matrix 1 3 0 composites PZT rods aligned in the poling direction held together by a foamed polymer matrix 3 1 and 3 2 composites holes drilled in a prepoledPZT block, then the holes filled or covered by polymer.3 3 composites lost wax method using coral as the starting material, or by a fugitive phase method BURPS process .The dh, g h coefficients and dh gh figure of merit of the diphasic composites are significantly improved over single phase PZT due to decoupling of the dn and d31 coefficients andlor the reduction of the dielectric constants. The piezoelectric ceramic polymer composites of 1 3, 1 39. 3 1, 3 2, and 3 3 connectivities are often expensive and cumbersome to fabricate. ThePZT polymer 0 3 composite is relatively easy and inexpensive to make. However, in 0 3 composites, early studies showed that the PZT particules should have a diameter greater than the thickness of the composites to obtain sufficient poling. For smaller particles of Pit, very large poling field strengths 100150 kV cm are needed to achieve sufficient poling. For a 0 3 composite consisting of spherical grains embedded in a matrix, the electric field E,, acting on an isolated spherical grain is give byEMI1.1 In this equation, K, and K2 are the dielectric constants of the spherical piezoelectric grains and the polymer matrix, respectively, and Etc is an externally applied electric field. For a 0 3 composite of PZT powder and polymer, K, is about 2000 andK2 about 5. In such a composite with an external field of 100 kV cm, the electric field acting on the piezoelectric particles is only about 1 kV cm which is insufficient to pole the composite. According to the above equation E, E only when the dielectric constant of the piezoelectric phase approaches that of the polymer phase.Most of the ferroelectric materials have very high dielectric constants and hence the above condition cannot be satisfied. One way to meet this poling difficulty is to raise the polymer matrix conductivity. In JapaneseKokai No. 56 93383, July 28, 1981, a piezoelectric material is prepared by dispersing fine piezoelectric ceramic powder in a high permittivity polymer matrix consisting of an insulating polymer and an organic substance with high conductivity.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION in accordance with the present invention, a piezoelectric polymer composite of 0 3 connectivity having improved poling field strength is fabricated by increasing the electrical conductivity of the poly mer phase. In a particular method, a third phase of metallic or semiconductive material in particulate form is added to the polymer matrix to enhance the polymer matrix conductivity. As a result, the conductivity of the polymer matrix will increase to about 10 รณ ohm cm and that of the composite as a whole will increase to 10 1 ohm 1 cm l. Increasing the conductivity of the polymer phase in the PZT polymer 0 3 composite greatly improves the poling conditions and consequently, inexpensive and useful 0 3 piezoceramic polymer composites can be fabricated.BRIEF DESCRIPTIONS OF THE DRAWING Figure 1 is a flow chart of the process steps for forming the 0 3 piezoelectric polymer composites of the Example. Figure 2 is a graph of d33 as a function of the poling field found during testing of piezoelectric composite samples.DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT In accordance with the present invention, a piezoelectric ceramic polymer composite of 0 3 connectivity is prepared by blending a piezoelectric ceramic powder and a particulate additive having conductive or semiconductive properties as a third phase into an insulating polymer matrix. The conductive or semiconductive phase may comprise an inorganic or organic substance in particulate form. Among the various particulate additives which can be utilized include carbon, germanium, silicon, and metals such as silver, etc. Organic compounds may include tetracyanoquinodimethane TONY . Generally, the conductive or semiconductive third phase should have a conductivity of at least10 3 ohm 1 cm 1. Any poiymeric material with high insulating property able to be blended with the piezoelectric ceramic powder and third phase conductive or semiconductive additive and capable of forming thin films can be used but the selection should be carefully considered according to the performance demanded. It is preferable for the polymer matrix to have as low as dielectric loss as possible. The examples of such polymers include polystyrene, polysulfone, polycarbonate, polypropylene, polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, polyphenylene oxide, polyurethane elastomer, polyvinyl carbazole and polyvinylidene fluoride. The mixtures of the aforementioned polymers and the copolymers of the aforementioned polymers could also be used. On the other hand if a low dielectric loss is not required any polymer could be used and the selection can be based on the ability to form thin films, heat resistance, mechanical properties, electrical properties and strength. For example, polyacrylate esters, polymethacrylate esters, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinylidenes, polymers of acrylonitrile, polymers of methacrylonitrile, polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, cellulose type polymers such as ethyl cellulose, soluble polymers of polyimide, epoxy resins, curable polymers such as unsaturated polyester resins can be used. The mixtures of the aforementioned polymers and the copolymers of aforementioned polymers could be used. It is preferable to blend less than 4 vol. of the conducting or semiconducting third phase particulate into the polymer matrix. The amount of the third phase additive will depend upon the conductivity thereof. Thus, depending upon the conductivity of the third phase additive, about 1.5 to about 4 vol. will be incorporated into the polymer matrix. The piezoelectric phase can be selected from among any of the piezoelectric ceramic powders including quartz, barium titanate, lead titanate, lead niobate, PZT, etc. The amount of fine piezoelectric ceramic powder used should be preferably selected so that the level of piezoelectric ceramic content is about 60 to about 70 vol. of the piezoelectric ceramic polymer composite. Although the piezoelectric ratio of the 0 3 composite obtained increases with the increasing amount of piezoelectric powder used, the mechanical properties and operation properties are adversely affected by the increasing level of piezoelectric ceramic phase.Thus, it is preferable to select the amount of piezoelectric ceramic powder to the range specified above.

If the polymer matrix is a thermosetting resin, the molded composite can be cured at elevated tempera tures.EXAMPLE 1 Figure 1 shows the sample preparation procedure used in this Example. Commercial Pit 501 powder was obtained from Ultrasonic Powder Inc.,South Plainfield, N.J., Eccogel 1365 0 an epoxy formulation was obtained from Emerson and Cuming, W.R. Grace and Co., Canton, MA., and finegrained carbon were used as piezoelectric filler, matrix, and additive to make 0 3 piezoelectric ce ramic composites. The PZT was mixed with the carbon powder and bail milled for 2 hours. The polymer matrix was then added to the particulate phase and mixed therein. The PZT compound comprised 68.5 vol. of the PZT polymer composite. Samples were cut 1 cm x 1 cm x 0.1 cm. in dimension and an air dry silver electrode was painted on both surfaces for poling and other transducer properties investigations. The hydrostatic voltage coefficient gh is about 6 to 10 times larger than that of single phase PZT.Similarly, the figure of Merit d hsh is 1 E to 8 times larger than that of single phase PZT. The results are summarized in Table 2.
