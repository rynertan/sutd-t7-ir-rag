# Organomolybdenum based additives and lubricating compositions containing same.

## Abstract
This invention relates to synergistic antiwear composi tions comprising a sulfurized molybdenum dialkyldithiocar bamate and an organic sulfur compound selected from the group consisting of dithiocarbamate acid esters, sulfurized oils and polysulfurized olefins. Lubricating compositions con taining the synergistic compositions possess good antiwear properties and improved extreme pressure and oxidation stability.
