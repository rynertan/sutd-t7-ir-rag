# Pulsar stabilized radiation detectors.

## Abstract
A radiation detector 1 useful for well logging and other applications contains a stabilizing pulsar device 7 compris ing a scintillator 21 coupled to a photodetector 9 and including a radioactive source 27 such as Am²⁴¹ which simultaneously emits X rays and low energy particles such as alpha or beta particles upon decay. The pulsar device 7 is coupled to the radiation detector 1 , which utilizes a scintillation crystal 17 and a photodetector 5 , and the outputs 8, 10 from the two photodetectors 5,9 are processed through a coincident anticoincident gate 11, 13, 15 alternately to stabilize the X rays or to read the environ mentally induced radiation.
