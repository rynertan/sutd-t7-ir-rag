## Description
2 BENZAZEPINE COMPOUNDS PROCESSES FC R THEIR IREPARATION AND PI ARIACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING TlllM This invention relates to 2 h nzdzepint compounds which inhibit the enzyme phenylethanolamine N methyl transferase, processes for the preparation of such compounds, and pharmaceutical compositions containing them. Epinephrine is a hormone, synthesized in the adrenal medulla, which is released into the bood stream in response to stress and produces physiological changes which serve to prepare the animal to cope with stress. For example, epinephrine produces anxiety, an increase in blood pressure, acceleration of heart rate, and increase in cardiac output.These changes are detrimental in individuals with certain disease conditions such as angina pectoris, myocardial infarction and anxiety neuroses. Phenylethanolamine N methyltransferase catalyzes the final step in the biosynthesis of epinephrine, that is the transfer of a methyl group from S adenosylmethionine to norepinephrine to produce epinephrine. The compounds of this invention inhibit phenylethanolamine N methyltransferase and ts reduce the formation of epinephrine. They are therefore of value in situations where there is overproduction of epinephrine or wre epinephrine production is detrimental. The compound of this invention are of formula EMI1.1 Formula I where R1 and R2, which are tie same or different, are hydrogen, chloro, bromo, fluoro, iodo, trifluoromethyl, amino, nitro, llydroxy, sulfamyl, methylthio, methylsulfinyl, methylsulfonyl, trichloromethylsulfinyl, trichloromethylsulfonyl, trifluoromethyltio, trifluoromethylsulfinyl, trifluoromethylsulfonyl, lower alkyl and lower alkoxy of from 1 to 3 carbon atoms each, provided that R1 and R2 are not both hydrogen andR3 and R4, which are the same or different, are hydrogen or lower alkyl of from 1 to 3 carbon atoms and pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof. preferred compounds of this invention are represented by formula I above wticn R1 and R2 are chloro, trifluoromethyl or sulfamyl, and R3 andR4 are both hydrogen. An advantageous compound of this invention is 8,9 dichloro 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro 1H 2 benzazepine. The compounds of this invention can be prepared by the following procedure EMI2.1 EMI3.1 where R1 K2 R3 and 1 4 are as defined above. According to tic above procedure, a substituted aniline is reacted with chloral hydrate, hydroxylamine hydrochloride, sodium sulfate, and hydrochloric acid, and Liven with concentrated sulfuric acid, Lo yield a 4 , 5 , or 4, 5 substituted isatin.The isatin is treated with m chloroperbenzoic acid, and then with sodium methoxide,to yield the 5 , 6 or 5, 6 substituted methyl anthranilate which in turn is converted into the correspondingly substituted methyl 3 2 carbomethoxy phenyljpropionate by treating the anthranilate with sodium nitrite, methyl acrylate and cuprous chloride followed by reduction, The propionate is reduced to the corresponding diol with lithium aluminium hydride or diborane, and cyclization is carried out by treating the diol with N,N dimethylaniline, thionyl chloride, and then with benzylamine to yield the 8 , 9 or 8,9 substituted 2 benzyl 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro 1H 2 benzazepine. This 2 benzazepine is then treated with cyanogen bromide and acid to give the desired 8 , 9 or 8,9 substituted 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro lH 2 benzazepine.Alternatively, the 2 benzyl group can be removed by catalytic hydrogenation. The N substituted compounds of formula I are formed by converting the N unsubstituted 2 benzazepine into an amide by reaction with a lower alkanoyl halide, and then reducing the amide, for example with diborane, to the desired N substituted 2 benzazepine. When a compound of Formula I is desired where R4 is other than hydrogen, the benzazepine is first oxidized to the imine as shown above, and then treated with an organometallic agent such as a lower alkyl magnesium halide. or a lower alkyl lithium to give the desired. product. Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds ofFormula 1 can be formed with organic and inorganic acids by methods known to the art. The base of Formula I can be reacted with an organic or inorganic acid in a water miscible solvent, such as acetone or ethanol, with isolation of the salt by concentration and cooling, or in a water immiscible solvent, such as ethyl ether or chloroform, with the desired salt separating directly.Examples of salts of this invention are the maleate, fumarate, benzoate, ascorbate, pamoate, succinate, bismethylenesalicylate, methanesulfonate, ethanedisulfonate, benzenesulfonate, acetate, propionate, tartrate, salicylate, citrate, gluconate, lactate, malate, mandelate, cinnamate, citraconate, aspartate, stearate, palmitate, itaconate, glycolate, p aminobenzoate, glutamate, theophylline acetates, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulfate, cyclohexylsulfamate, phosphate and nitrate salts 7 Chloro 2,3,,5 tetrahydro lii 2 benzazepine is known in the art,J. Chem.

The following are results comparing 2 benzazet .e compounds of the invention with the 7 chloro prior art compound. Table 1 In Vitro x InhibitionEMI5.1 Compound lO M M 10 M 7 chloro 96 21 8 chloro 99 76 8,9 dichloro 99 96 The results of this test clearly demonstrate that both the 8 chloro and the preferred compound of this invention, 8,9 dichloro 2 benzazepine, are greater inhibitors of PNMT than the known 7 chloro compound. In addition, the activity of the compounds of this invention is demonstrated in vivo by their administration to mice at 50 mg. kg. per day for seven consecutive days. Male mice were dosed orally with either drug or vehicle control on a twice a day basis fcr seven consecutive days. On the morning of the next day they were again dosed, and two hours later they were sacrificed by decapitation. The adrenal glands were then removed and analyzed fluorometrically for both epinephrine and norepinephrine content. A compound is considered active as a PS41T inhibitor if it significantly at leastEMI5.2 decreases the adrenal epinephrine norepinephrine ratio. R.G. Pendleton et al., J. Pharmac.l Exp.
