NOTE The secondary combustible is defined as The combustible to be introduced in an oven to heat the primary combustible contained by the reactor to increase the temperature according to the various phases of preheating, drying, pyrolysis. As Secondary combustibles are considered wood,charcoal coal, combustible gas, combustible oil, gas recycled from the PYROLYSIS.Such a technological cycle, for a 6 reactors plant, is indicatively illustrated by the Table N06.This cycle differs from the one applied to the already operating industrial slants because of its utilization of multiple diabatic reactors, which do accomplish together the above technological cycle, but one by one, out of the system, are available to the phase of unloading the pyrolytic charcoal and to that of loading the primary combustible. ra Subsequent pallet pyrolysis .The number of reactors may vary. twos four, six, eight etc..., according to the capacity of the plant one wants, according to the different utilization of the various thermal levels of the total cycle, and according to the continuity applied to the pyrolytic condensable and incondensable products withdrawal.In the Table N07 one among the many possibilities is reported for the operative cycles composition, where the above phases are made continuous. Tables 7a 7b .The evident advantages by the utilization of multiple diabatic reactors, in comparison with afl adiabatic continuous reactor are The easy handling of the primary combustible, with a volumic size, higher by a ratio 10 to 1 in comparison to that for the single adiabatic continuous reactor. The reduction of the preparation cost for the primary combustible, as the above point. The cost reduction for maintenance, and for primary combustible and pyrolytic charcoal transportation. The elimination of the primary combustible chopping necessity. The elimination of the reactor clogging possibility, because of it peculiar form, that will be described as a substantial aspect of this invention. The optimal exploitation, by the diabatic reactors of the available heat, with an efficiency, very high, globally more than 80 . The semplified recovery of the pyrolytic fluids.To improve the exploitation of the cycle, the tecnique of the supplementary recycling at a high rate and high velocity of the combustion fumes, is used together with a good control of the oxygen content.This will help the homogeneization of the process ih each point of the primary combustible and pyrolytic charcoal. 3 THE MONOSTAGE PYROLYSIS REACTOR DIABATIC FOR THE SUBSEQUENT PARALLEL PYROLYSIS.In the table N08 the pyrolytic reactor concerning the invention is sketched, as applicable to a process already discussed at the point N02, and indicated in the table N06.The reactor substantially shows the following parts 1 The reactor body 2 The movable cartridge to hold the primary combustible and or the pyrolytic charcoal, made by bored sheet iron 40 of the surface holes 3 The suitable jacket for the heat transfer and transportation 4 The thermal insulation for high temperatures up to 12000C 5 The opening for the introduction and or the extraction of the cartridge 6 The thermal carrier deviating devices the thermal carrier are the high temperature combustion fumes. 7 The flanged pipe connections a for the thermal carrier inlet to the jacket, and its recycle. b for the thermal carrier outlet from the jacket c for the valet of a part of the thermal carrier to the reactor and its cycle. d for the outlet from the reactor of the termal carrier containing the pyrolytic fluids of the cartridge. 8 The temperature measure points 9 The pressure measure points 10 The safety device 11 The basisscombined to the reactor by bolts or other systems.The components must be thermostress resistant, and in fact the reactor is made in order that all the elements are independent each other, two resist to the temperature effects. The life of the reactor, by this way, is longer, because the thermal dilatations are independent.The thermal expansions are higher particularly on the body and jacket of the reactor, wich are exposed within 8 12 hours to thermal escursions up to 6500 COther kinds of stresses must be considered 1 Thermomechanique stress due to the reactor weight 2 Thermochimique stress due to the presence of pyrolytic acids at very hight temperature .During a cycle,so thermically complex, composite materials are not usable, but it is necessary the use of chemioresistant materials and special stainless steels.The thickness is important to reduce the significative deformations, generated bw the said temperature escursions. The geometric construction of the reactor must take into account the capacity of the plant and necessary proportions according to the thermodynamic needs of the system.With reference to the APPENDIX TO THE TABLES N 1 5 , and to the balance of materials, the pessary heat, to accomplish the thermal cycle, on a quantity of 1000 Kg. of wet wood 15 of water , is calculated a Balance of materials Wet wood Kg. 1000 EMI16.1 tb SEP Water SEP 15 SEP on SEP the SEP total SEP Kg.
