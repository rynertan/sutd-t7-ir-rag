# Magnetic head.

## Abstract
The head 1 has a monocrystalline core 2 of a magnetizable material which provides a substantially closed path for magnetic flux B in write read operations. In order to provide a magnetic head which has an improved signal to noise ratio in particular in the frequency range from 0.5 10 MHz, the magnetizable material of the core 2 shows essentially an uniaxial magnetic anisotropy having an easy axis of magnetization which is transverse to the plane of the path for the magnetic flux. Said orientation of the easy axis of magnetization is produced in one embodiment by coating the faces of the core which are parallel to the path for the magnetic flux with layers of non magnetizable material 8,9 which exert a tensile or compressive stress in said planes.
