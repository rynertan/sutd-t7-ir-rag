## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTION SUBSTITUTED HEXAHYDRO ARYLQUINOLIZINESBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention is concerned with novel substituted hexahydro arylquinolizines or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof which are selective a2 adrenoceptor antagonists and are of value in conditions where selective antagonism of the a 2 adrenoceptor is desirable for example as antidepressant, antihypertensive, or antidiabetic agents or platelet aggregation inhibitors. It also relates to processes for preparing the novel compounds, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the novel compounds and to a method of antagonizing a 2 adrenoceptors. The concept that the complex clinical state of depression is linked to a functional deficiency of monoamines in the central nervous system is now widely accepted. Numerous biochemical and clinical observations support the proposal that many forms of depressive illness are associated with reductions in adrenergic activity at functionally important sites in the brain. Thus, classical antidepressive drugs, such as amitriptyline and imipramine, are believed to act by blocking the neuronal reuptake of norepinephrine and or serotonin, thereby enhancing the availability of the monoamines as neurotransmitters. In addition to al adrenergic receptors which mediate postsynaptic responses to the neurotransmitter, norepinephrine, other adrenergic receptors are present at or near sympathetic terminals. These latter receptors, a2 adrenergic receptors, form part of a negative feedback system which modulates noradrenergic neurotransmission by controlling the impulse induced release of norepinephrine from presynaptic terminals.Activation of a2 adrenergic receptors results in a decrease in the amount of norepinephrine normally released from the nerve terminals by nerve impulses while antagonism of a2 adrenergic receptors increases norepinephrine release. Therefore, molecules that block a2 adrenergic receptors afford an alternate approach to enhancement of noradrenergic function and the treatment of depression associated with an absolute or relative deficiency of adrenergic function. a2 Adrenergic receptor antagonism is also associated with antidiabetic, antihypertensive and platelet aggregation inhibition activity. Compounds structurally related to the novel compounds of this invention are disclosed in BritishPatents 1,435,573 and 2,106,909 of John Wyeth andBrother, Ltd.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION This invention is concerned with a compound of structural formula I EMI3.1 or a pharmaceutical acceptable salt thereof, whereinAr represents an aromatic heterocycle such as EMI3.2 pyridino benzofuro thiazoloEMI3.3 imidazo pyrazolo benzothieno thieno furo 1 and R2 are independently, 1 hydrogen, 2 halo, such as chloro, bromo, or fluoro, 3 hydroxy, 4 C13alkoxy, or 5 Cl 6alkyl, either straight or branched chain R3 is l hydrogen, 2 EMI4.1 wherein R is hydrogen or C13 alkyl 3 C1 6 alkyl, either unsubstituted or substituted with one or more of a hydroxy, b carboxy, c C1 3alkoxycarbonyl, d halo such as fluoro, chloro or bromo, e C1 3alkoxy, f CONR6R7 wherein R6 and R7 are the same or different and are hydrogen or Cl 5alkyl or joined together either directly to form a 5 7 membered ring such as pyrrolidino, or piperidino, or through a heteroatom selected from N, 0, and S, form a 6 membered heterocycle with the nitrogen to which they are attached such as morpholino, piperazino, N C1 3 alkylpiperazino, or g NR6R7X isEMI5.1 R4 is 1 OR8 wherein R8 is hydrogen or C1 6 alkyl, either unsubstituted or substituted with one or more of a OR, or b NRCOR, 2 N R8 2 wherein the R8 groups are the same or different. 3 CO2R8 4 CONR6R7 5 C1 6alkyl, either unsubstituted or substituted with a OR8 b halo, c C02R8 d CONR6R7 6 C2 5alkenyl, 7 C2 5alkynyl, 8 C3 6cycloalkyl, 9 5 or 6 membered heterocycle including up to 2 heteroatoms selected from 0, N and S, such as imidazo, thiazolo, oxazolo, piperidino, piperazino, pyridino, or pyrazino, 10 carbocyclic aryl, of 6 to 10 carbon atoms such as phenyl or naphthyl, either unsubstituted or substituted with one or more of a halo, b OR, or c C1 3alkyl R3 and R4, taken together directly or through a heteroatom selected from 0, N and S, form a 5 or 6 membered heterocycle with the nitrogen to which they are attached such as 2 oxazolidinon l yl, or succinimidoyl. 5 is 1 hydrogen, 2 C16 alkyl, either unsubstituted or substituted with one or more of a OR8, b NR8COR8, or c CO2R8, 3 CO2R68, 4 CONR6R7 orR3 and R5 or R4 and R5, if R5 is in the 1 or 3 position and both are alkyl, can be joined together to form a 5 or 6 membered ring. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts coming within the purview of this invention include the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts.Acids useful for preparing these acid addition salts include, inter alia, inorganic acids, such as the hydrohalic acids e.g., hydrochloric and hydrobromic acid , sulfuric acid, nitric acid, and phosphoric acid, and organic acids such as maleic, fumaric, tartaric, citric, acetic, benzoic, 2 acetoxybenzoic, salicylic, succinic, theophylline, 8 chlorotheophylline, p aminobenzoic, p acetamidobenzoic, methanesulfonic, or ethanedisulfonic acid. In apreferred emboidiment of this invention,Ar is RÚ,Rê benzo b furo or RÚ,Rê benzo b thieno. It is further preferred that R1 and R2 be hydrogen or halo and R3 be Cl 6alkyl, especially methyl, and that R4 be C1 6alkyl, di Cl 3 alkyl amino, halo C1 6 alkyl, hydroxyC1 6 alkyl, C2 5 alkenyl, carbocyclic aryl, 5 or 6 membered heterocycle, CO2R8, C1 6 alkylCO2R8 or C1 6alkyl CONR6R7.

It is most preferred that RÚ and Rê be hydrogen, R3 be methyl, R4 be C1 6 alkyl, hydroxypropyl, hydroxyethyl, dimethylamino, C1 3 alkoxycarbonylethyl, or dimethylaminocarbonylmethyl, and R5 be hydrogen. The novel compounds of this invention are depicted herein as having a 12b alpha ,2ss configuration EMI7.1 and it is the more preferred isomer for CL2adrenoceptor blockade activity. However, the 12b alpha ,2 alpha isomers are also active a2 adrenoceptor blockers and are considered to be within the scope of this invention. Each of the 12ba,2a and 12ba,2ss configura tional isomers are racemates capable of being resolved into dextrorotatory and levorotatory enantiomers. This invention includes these pure enantiomers as well as all mixtures thereof, especially the racemates. A novel process for preparing novel compounds of this invention comprises acylation carboxyl or sulfonyl of the compound of structureIIa EMI8.1 with an acylating reagent such as an acid anhydride, activated ester, mixed acid anhydride or acid halide capable of introducing a substituent of formula XR4, and preferably wherein the reagent is of structure R4 X halo wherein halo is chloro, bromo or iodo, preferably chloro, and X isEMI8.2 The reaction is conducted in an inert solvent such as a chlorinated hydrocarbon, e.g., methylene chloride, chloroform, 1,2 dichloroethane or the like in the presence of an acid acceptor such as triethylamine, pyridine, an alkali metal carbonate, or basic anion exchange resin.The reaction usually proceeds readily at about room temperature but any temperature from about OOC to the boiling point of the reaction mixture is reasonable depending on the reactivity of the particular acyl halide and temperature. Reaction times of about half an hour to about 48 hours are required, and in most cases about one to 18 hours suffices. In those compounds wherein XR4 is a carbamoyl or thiocarbamoyl group such asEMI9.1 an alternative novel process comprises treatment of compound IIa with the appropriate alkyl isocyanate or isothiocyanate respectively. The synthesis is conducted in an inert organic solvent or lower alkanol such as ethanol, propanol, 1,2 dimethoxvethane or the like at about room temperature 200C to 1000C for about 5 minutes to about 2 hours. The novel process for the preparation of the compound wherein R3 and XR4 are joined together to form the sultam or lactam substructure EMI9.2 comprises treating the compound with substructureEMI9.3 with a strong base such as potassium t butoxide, n butyl lithium, sodium hydride or the like in an ethereal solvent such as 1,2 dimethoxyethane, diglyme, THF or the like at about 200C to 600C for about one to 5 hours. The novel process for preparing compounds with an imide substructure in the 2 position such asEMI10.1 comprises heating compound IIa wherein R3 is hydrogen with the corresponding cyclic dicarboxylic anhydride of structure EMI10.2 respectively in an inert solvent such as toluene or with no solvent at about 100 to 1500C for about 2 to 5 hours. The novel compounds with a cyclic carbamate, cyclic urea or cyclic sulfamide in the 2 position of structures EMI10.3 are prepared by treating the compound with substructure EMI11.1 wherein Y is O or NR6 with carbonyl diimidazole or sulfuryl chloride in an inert solvent such as dimethoxyethane, methylene chloride or the like at about 20 to 600C in the presence of an acid acceptor such as triethylamine, di isopropyl ethylamine or the like for about 5 to 18 hours. In the novel method of selectively antagonizing a 2 adre nergic receptors in a patient, a novel compound or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, is administered in an amount ranging from about 0.01 to about 20 mg per kg of body weight per day, preferably from about 0.1 to about 10 mg per kg of body weight per day in a single dose or in 2 to 4 divided doses. The novel compounds of this invention can be administered as the sole active ingredient or in combination with other antidepressants such as amitriptyline, imipramine or other norepinephrine or serotonin reuptake inhibitor or a monoamine oxidase inhibitor. These doses are useful for treating depression, diabetes, hypertension and abnormal platelet aggregation. The compounds, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, of the present invention, in the described dosages, are administered orally, intraperitoneally, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, transdermally or intravenously. They are preferably administered orally, for example in the form of tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, chewing gum, or the like prepared by art recognized procedures. The amount of active compound in such therapeutically useful compositions or preparations is such that a suitable dosage will be obtained.

The compound may be prepared by these methods as a racemic mixture or as either single enantiomer. The enantiomers are obtained by resolving the final compound or any intermediate containing a center of chirality. Flow Sheet I illustrates the preparation ofCompound III by sulfonylating the amine from Example 1 with a 2 hydroxyethanesulfonic acid derivative or with an O protected form which is hydrolytically or hydrogenolytically labile. Flow Sheet II shows the synthesis ofCompound III via an intermediate imine which in turn is prepared from the ketone of Example 1.Sulfonylation of the imine affords the sulfonamido substituted olefin which is reduced to Compound III. Flow Sheet III indicates that reduction of the appropriate ester, affords Compound III. Flow Sheet IV illustrates the process whereby the secondary sulfonamide is obtained from the primary amine from Step A of Example 7.Alkylation of this intermediate yields Compound III.Alternatively, hydroxyethylation followed by reduction yields III. The reaction will also work if the precusor to be hydroxyethylated is unprotected. Flow Sheet V outlines the homologat on of a methanesulfanamide derivative to Compound IIw via an organometallic species. Flow Sheet VI illustrates processes employing more complex butadiene components in the cycloaddition reaction. The resulting sulfonamido substituted dihydropyridines are then reduced directly or in a stepwise fashion to Compound III. Flow Sheet VII depicts the synthesis ofCompound III wherein construction of the 7 7a bond completes the tetracyclic skeleton. Subsequent reduction affords the product. Flow Sheet VIII shows a synthetic route toCompound III wherein construction of the 12a 12b bond by acid catalyzed cyclization completes the tetracyclic skeleton. Subsequent reduction, directly or in steps, yields the product. Flow Sheet IX shows the synthesis ofCompound III which involves alkylating the appropriately substituted piperidine with 3 2 haloethyl benzofuran. Oxidation of this intermediate with Hg OAc 2 or similar oxidant to the iminium salt under controlled conditions causes cyclization to the tetracyclic skeleton of CompoundIII. Excess oxidant results in the formation of a tetracyclic iminium salt which is reduced to CompoundIII. Flow Sheet X shows a synthesis of CompoundIII in which an appropriately substituted 2 piperidone is treated with base to generate amide anion. Alkylation with 3 2 haloethyl benzofuran yields an intermediate which can be cyclized under acidic conditions to he tetracyclic iminium salt.Reduction and deprot zion affords the product.Alternatively, the a Slated 2 piperidone may be reduced to an enamin Acid catalyzed cyclization affords Compound III. Flow Sheet XI illustrates a synthesis ofCompound III which exploits the known rearrangement of O phenyloximes to benzofurans. Alkylation of the appropriately substituted piperidine occurs under standard conditions. Oxidation of the amine to the corresponding N oxide followed by CF3CO 2O mediated dehydration to the iminium intermediate. Addition of cyanide affords the aminonitrile. Treatment with base and aqueous work up produces the keto ester which can be decarboxylated under a variety of conditions. The resulting ketone is condensed withO phenylhydroxylamine to yield the 0 phenyloxime. Acid causes rearrangement and cyclization to the benzofuran of Compound III.
