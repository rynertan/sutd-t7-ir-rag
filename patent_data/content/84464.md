# Connector for electronic subassemblies.

## Abstract
A connector for electronic subassemblies is initially formed as a small sphere having an outer coating of solder 2 , for example 1.0mm in diameter, and an inner core 4 of copper, for example 0.5mm in diameter. To effect a connection, the connector is positioned between an electrical bonding pad 16 of an integrated circuit chip 12 and an interconnect pattern 14 on a ceramic substrate 10 , and is then heated so that the solder 2 flows, making mechanical and electrical contact to the pad and interconnect pattern on the chip and substrate. The copper 4 core does not melt and maintains a predetermined space, between the chip 12 and substrate 10 .
