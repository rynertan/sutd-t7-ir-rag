# A system for remotely adjusting a parameter of an electrical circuit within an enclosure.

## Abstract
Gas sensors 1 are mounted on respective explosion proof housings 2 that contain microprocessor circuitry 11 for operat ing signals from the sensors. Signals from the circuitry 11 are transmitted along a digital highway 4 to a central control unit. The sensors may be located at remote locations in an industrial process plant or for example along the roof of a tunnel. A non contact hand held unit 12 is provided for individually setting operating parameters of the circuitry 11, to enable factors such as zero set, span and linearity to be set for the sensors individ ually. A two way wireless communication link is provided be tween the unit 12 and a transducer 15 on the housing 1, so that the current value of the circuit operating parameters can be dis played on a display 18 on the hand held unit.
