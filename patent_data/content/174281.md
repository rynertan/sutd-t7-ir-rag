# A PROCESS FOR THE DECONTAMINATION AND CLEANING OF MONUMENTAL MARBLE WORKS

## Abstract
A process for the decontamination and cleaning of monumental marble works, consisting in the immersion into deionized water of said works, said water being pushed by a pump for the circulation in a column containing ionic exchange resins which separate the SOâ‚„ ione as quickly as possible from said solution, said ione deriving from the dissolving of the calcium sulphate so that the calcium bicarbonate formed following to the dissolving of the sulphate contained in the work immediately precipitates at values of PH 7 7.5 in the form un undissolvable carbonate, determining the formation of a superficial crust that can be easily removed with a distilled water jet so as to leave the clean marble underneath.
