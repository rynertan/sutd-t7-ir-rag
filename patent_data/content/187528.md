## Description
This invention relates to a compound FR 68504. More particularly, it relates to a compound FR 68504 which has antitumor activity, to a process for producing FR 68504 by culturing a FR 68504 producing strain belonging to the species The FR 68504 obtained in the Example as mentioned below has the following physicochemical properties The FR 68504 can be prepared by culturing a FR 68504 producing strain belonging to the species It is to be understood that the production of the new compound, FR 68504 is not limited to the use of the particular organism described herein, which is given for illustrative purpose only. This invention also includes the use of any mutants which are capable of producing the FR 68504 including natural mutants as well as artificial mutants which can be produced from the described organism by conventional means, such as X rays, ultra violet radiation, treatment with N methyl N nitro N nitrosoguanidine, 2 aminopurine and the like. The ascomata developed on corn meal agar or YpSs agar after one month, and the hyphal conidiomata were observed on various culture media. The conidiogenesis is holoarthric. The ascomata are superficial, globose or subglobose, yellow and 500 1000 µm in diameter. They are often aggregated and formed to stroma like masses more than 3000 µm in diameter. The peridium consists of the interwoven hyphae, whose tips are sinurate or spiral. The asci bear irregularly in the ascomata and develop on firmly coiled gametangia in clusters. They are unitunicate, evanescent, eight spored, obovoid to pyriform with a short stalk, 13 15.5 µm long and 9 10 µm thick. The ascospores are unicellular, yellow, echinulate but finally reticulate, globose and 4 5 µm diameter. The arthroconidia are produced at the tips or in intercalary positions of vegetative hyphae. They are unicellular, hyaline, smooth, cylindrical or ovoid with the truncate base, 8 18 µm long and 4 6 µm. The vegetative hyphae are septate, hyaline, smooth and branched. The hyphal cells are cylindrical and 1.5 5 µm thick. The chlamydospores are absent. Colonies on malt extract agar grow rather rapidly, attaining 3.5 cm in diameter after 2 weeks at 25 C. The colony surface is plane or slightly raised, felty to floccose, and pale yellow. Neither ascomata nor conidiomata are observed. The reverse is yellow to dark yellow. Colonies on YpSs agar are similar to those on malt extract agar in rate of growth. The surface is plane, felty and pale yellow to yellowish gray. The reverse is pale yellow. The ascomata are formed on this medium after one month at 25 C. Cultures on corn meal agar grow to 2.0 cm in diameter under the same conditions. They are plane, thin, felty and pale yellow. At the center of them many ascomata are formed, and the ascospores mature after 3 to 4 weeks. The strain F 3405 can grow at the temperature in the range from 5 to 29 C with the growth optimum at 23 to 26 C. These temperatural data were determined using a temperature gradient incubator Toyo Kagaku Sangyo Co., Ltd. on potato dextrose agar. This strain can grow at pH 3 to 10, and has a growth optimum at pH 5 to 7 in YM broth medium Difco . On the basis of the morphological characteristics of the strain F 3405, the strain appears to belong to the ascomycete genus According to the taxonomic criteria of the genus In general, FR 68504 can be produced by culturing a FR 68504 producing strain in a nutrient medium containing assimilable sources of carbon and of nitrogen, preferably under aerobic conditions e.g. shaking culture, submerged culture, etc. . The preferred sources of carbon in the nutrient medium are carbohydrate such as glucose, fructose, glycerin and starch. Other sources which may be included are lactose, arabinose, xylose, dextrin, molasses and the like. The preferred sources of nitrogen are yeast extract, peptone, gluten meal, cottonseed meal, soybean meal, corn steep liquor, dried yeast, etc., as well as inorganic and organic nitrogen compounds such as ammonium salts e.g. ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulphate, ammonium phosphate, etc. , urea, amino acid and the like. The carbon and nitrogen sources, though advantageously employed in combination, need not be used in their pure form because less pure materials which contain traces of growth factors and considerable quantities of mineral nutrients, are also suitable for use. When desired, there may be added to medium such mineral salts as calcium carbonate, sodium or potassium phosphate, sodium or potassium iodide, magnesium salt, cobalt chloride and the like. If necessary, especially when the culture medium is foamed remarkably, a defoaming agent such as liquid paraffin, higher alcohol, plant oil, mineral oil and silicones may be added. As conditions for the production in massive amounts, submerged aerobic cultural condition is preferred for the production of the FR 68504. For the production in small amounts, a shaking or surface culture in a flask or bottle is employed. Furthermore, when the growth is carried out in large tanks, it is preferable to use the vegetative form of the organism for inoculation in the production tanks in order to avoid growth lag in the process of production of the FR 68504. Accordingly, it is desirable first to produce a vegetative inoculum of the organism by inoculating a relatively small quantity of culture medium with spores or mycelia of the organism and culturing said inoculated medium, and then to transfer the cultured vegetative inoculum aseptically to large tanks. As the medium, in which the vegetative inoculum is produced, there can be used the substantially same as or somewhat different medium from medium utilized for main production of the FR 68504. Agitation and aeration of the culture mixture may be accomplished in a variety of ways. Agitation may be provided by a propeller or the similar mechanical agitation equipment, by revolving or shaking the fermenter, by various pumping equipment or by the passage of sterile air through the medium. Aeration may be effected by passing sterile air through the fermentation mixture. The fermentation is usually conducted at a temperature about between 20 C and 40 C, preferably around 25 C, for a period of 50 hours to 100 hours, which may be varied according to the fermentation conditions and scale. Thus produced FR 68504 can be recovered from the culture medium by conventional means which are commonly used for the recovery of other fermentation products such as antibiotics. In general, most of the FR 68504 produced are found in the culture filtrate, and accordingly FR 68504 can be isolated from the filtrate, which is obtained by filtering or centrifuging the broth, by a conventional method such as concentration under reduced pressure, lyophilization, extraction with a conventional solvent, pH adjustment, treatment with a conventional resin e.g. anion or cation exchange resin, non ionic adsorption resin , treatment with a conventional adsorbent e.g. activated charcoal, silicic acid, silica gel, cellulose, alumina , crystallization, recrystallization and the like.
