# Electrostatic latent image developing method.

## Abstract
A toner carrying layer of a resistive material is formed on the electrode opposite the image bearing member, a high frequency alternating electric field is applied between the electrode and the substrate to form a fringing field in a latent image portion of the image bearing member.
