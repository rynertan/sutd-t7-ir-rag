## Abstract
A method of fabricating a field effect transistor comprising the steps of forming an active layer of semiconductor material eg GaAs, over a surface of a first substrate 1 of semiconductor material, eg also GaAs forming a gate electrode 7 on the surface of the active layer 4 , applying a second substrate 11 of insulating material to the surface of this structure, removing the first substrate, and forming source and drain electrodes 16, 17 on the opposite surface of the active layer to the gate electrode. To facilitate removal of the GaAs first substrate by selective etching, a buffer layer 2 of the GaA1As resistant to the GaAs etchant, may be formed between the active layer and the first substrate, which buffer layer is removed, following removal of the first substrate, using a selective etchant to which the GaAs active layer is resistant. A second gate electrode may be formed on the opposite surface of the active layer to that on which the first gate electrode is formed. The technique is particularly applicable to high frequency FET devices.
