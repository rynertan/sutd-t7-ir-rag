# Circuit board thickness compensator.

## Abstract
The invention disclosed herein is a device 22 which is incorporated onto card edge connectors 10 and compensates varying circuit board 12 thicknesses so as to provide improved gang insertion of such connectors 10 . Selective collapsing of projections 22 against a circuit board by insertion pressure accommodates variations in the board thickness and allows upper surfaces of the connectors 10 to be maintained coplanar.
