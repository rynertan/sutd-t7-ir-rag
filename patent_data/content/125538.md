# Single acting fluid pressure operable device.

## Abstract
A fluid pressure operable device 1 includes two relatively movable components 2, 3 defining a variable volume working chamber 9. A sealing element 5 of elas tomeric material is carried, or formed, by one of the compo nents and is in sliding and sealing engagement with the other of the components normally to resist escape of fluid under pressure from chamber 9 to the exterior thereof. That face 15 of element 5 remote from the chamber is so provided with channel 16 that as pressure in the chamber increases the element is permitted progressively to deform and some of the material of the element thus displaced is then accom modated by the channel. When the pressure exceeds a pre determined value, deformation of the element is such that sealing engagement of the element with the other of said components is broken so that the pressure in chamber 9 is relieved to the exterior thereof.
