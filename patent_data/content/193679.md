# Snap in anchor for denture.

## Abstract
A snap in anchor for a denture, including an open sided sleeve with a socket at one end, which is inset and secured directly in an existing tooth. A snap pin with an enlarged head is embedded in the denture by a retaining lug extend ing from the pin, the denture being anchored by sliding the pin into the sleeve and snapping the head into the socket. The sleeve has resilient side walls that frictionally grip the entire length of the pin for stability but that allow very limited movement of the denture to accommodate jaw motions.
