# ELECTRODE FOR PHOTOVOLTAIC CELL AND METHOD OF MANUFACTURING IT

## Abstract
In a photovoltaic cell which comprises a first electrode, a first layer of cadmium sulfide, a second layer of cuprous sulfide forming a barrier junction with said first layer, and a second electrode, the improvement wherein said second elec trode is formed by coating a conducting metal wire with a solid polymer containing electrically conductive particles, and attaching the coated wire to the cuprous sulfide layer by the application of moderate heat and or pressure.
