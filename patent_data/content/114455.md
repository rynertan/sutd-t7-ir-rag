## Description
TECHNICAL FIELD OF INVENTIONThe invention relates to a coupling for a conduit, and to a conduit with a coupling mounted thereon.BACKGROUND ARTCouplings for conduits, whether of rigid or flexible material, are often heavy and or cumbersome and usually require the use of a sealing ring of sane kind whereby to provide a fluid tight seal between the coupling and the conduit. Such seals are often easily dislodged or become damaged or deformed. In either case, the union between the coupling and conduit is damaged, and fluid leakage can occur.DISCLOSURE OF INVENTIONIt is an object of the invention to seek to mitigate these disadvantages of the prior art.According to one aspect of the invention there is provided a coupling for a conduit of the kind having an internal surface with convolutions extending axially of the conduit, comprising a first part with external surface convolutions complementary to those of a conduit to which the coupling is to be connected, and a second part defining with the first part a gap which has an open end and a closed end which is narrower than the open end whereby when an end of the conduit is inserted in the open end of the gap and the coupling and conduit are relatively rotated, the respective convolutions engage and draw the couPling and conduit together so that a seal is formed between the end of the conduit and the first and second parts of the coupling.Using the invention it is possible to provide a simple yet firm, fluid, particularly a liquid tight, for example, water tight, union between a coupling and a conduit without the use of separate seals such as 0 rings or annular flanges. The first and second parts may diverge in an axial direction away from the closed end so that the gap tapers to the junction between the first and second parts. This connection provides a firm sealing action.The external surface convolutions may be in the form of a helix.This provides for a simple rotational connection with, say, a wire helix of a conduit such as an electrically shielded conduit.There may be mutually complementary securing means between the first and second parts which may comprise respective screw threads of the first and second parts. This provides for relatively simple construction of the coupling.The coupling may be of metal, whereby to provide an electrical connection with an electrical shield of an electrically shielded conduit.A coupling embodying the invention is hereinafter described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGSFig. 1 is an axial sectional view of a coupling according to the invention Fig. 2 is an enlarged scrap detail of part of the coupling of Fig.l Fig. 3 is an enlarged sectional view of an assembled coupling ofFigs. 1 and 2 and a conduit.and Figs. 4 6 show respectively different kinds of conduit which can be assembled with the coupling of Figs. 1 and 2.Referring to the drawings, there is shown a coupling 1 for a conduit comprising a first metal part 2 which has external surface convolutions in the form of a helix 3 and a second metal part 4 secured to the first part 3 by mutually carplementary securing means in the form of screw threads 5 and 6. The second part 4 defines with the first part a gap 7 which has an open end and which tapers towards a closed end adjacent the union between the two parts at the screw threads 5 and 6.The first and second parts 2 and 4 are both tubular, the second part 4 forming a sleeve or shroud for the first part 2 and butting against a shoulder 8 of the first part when the two parts are secured together by the screw threads.The first part 2 also has a cylindrical threaded connector 9 which is an integral part of the first part and is situated axially of the coupling on the side of the shoulder 8 remote from the convolutions 3.In order to provide the tapering gap, the external surface 10 of the first part beyond the start of the helical convolutions is stepped and converges towards second part 4, at successive angles of 300 and 100 to the horizontal on the embodiment shown, though any suitable angles could be used. The internal surface 11 as viewed of the second part 4 is inclined downwardly towards the first part 2.In use to mount the coupling 1 on a conduit 12 Fig. 3 such as an electrically shielded conduit having internal surface convolutions in the form of a helix 13, a flexible plastics liner 14, metallic braid 15 and flexible plastics sheath 16, the complete coupling 1 is offered up to the end of the conduit 12 and the free end of the first part 2 is inserted in the conduit and the coupling is rotated so that the external surface convolutions 3 pick up and ride along the internal convolutions 13 of the conduit and the first part 2 is drawn axially into the conduit as shown, the conduit itself being forced into the tapered gap 7 between the first and second parts 2 and 4, the second part 4 lying externally of the outer surface of the conduit.This rotation thus draws the coupling and conduit together, the end of the conduit 12 being firmly clamped between them in a water tight permanent seal at the closed end of the gap 7. The sheath 16 makes a firm, water tight or environmental seal against the inclined surface 11 of the second part and the metallic braid or shield 15 is clamped with a firm metal to metal contact with the surface 11, the liner 14 making a firm water tight or environmental seal on inclined surface 10.The conduit can then be connected with other apparatus via the threaded connector 9.Figs. 4 to 6 show other forms of conduit which can be coupled with the coupling 1 other than the kind of conduit 12 shown in Fig 3.As the conduits are similar, like reference numerals are used to identify the different parts.In Fig. 4, the conduit 17 has a rigid inner as viewed plastic or metallic helix or coil 13, a flexible plastics liner 14 and external as viewed metallic braid 15.Fig 5. shows a conduit 18 which has an inner as viewed rigid plastic helix or coil 13 and an outer as viewed flexible plastics liner 14.Fig. 6 shows a conduit 19 in which the inner as viewed coil 13 carprises an interlocked strip, preferably of metal, rather than comprising a regularly shaped coil as in Figs. 3 to 5, the interlocked metal strip being inside an outer flexible plastics liner 14. It will be understood that in every emixxliment, firm environmental seals are formed between the coupling 1 and the conduit 17, 18 or 19 and that the conduits 17, 18 or 19 are asseMbled with the coupling 1 in the same way as described with respect to the conduit 12 ofFig. 3. It will also be understood that the coupling 1 may be formed in one piece, rather than in two pieces requiring connection at threads 5 and 6.It will be understood that the coupling 1 above described and shown in the drawings may be modified. Thus it may be of T shape or L shape rather than in line as shown. Also, if a non electrical conduit is to be mounted thereon it may be made of material which is non conducting. Also, the outer surface 11 of the second part 4 is itself tapered towards the surface 11 in a direction away from the threads 5 and 6 in the embodiment shown, but this feature may be omitted.
