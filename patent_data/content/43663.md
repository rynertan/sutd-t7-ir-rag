# DAISY WHEEL PRINTERS

## Abstract
A daisy wheel printer wherein a non contacting sensor 24 is employed to detect the rotational position of the daisy wheel 10 by response to the interrupting action of the char acter stalks 12, 14 and to produce a train of pulses providing positional information in accordance with said interrupting ac tion. In accordance with the invention, each stalk of the daisy wheel is divided by a longitudinal slit 26 into two or more branches 28, 30 thereby to increase the frequency of the in terrupting action and, for a given rotation of the wheel, to cause the sensor to produce a train of pulses 32 containing a number of pulses which is an integral multiple of the number of stalks passing the sensor.
