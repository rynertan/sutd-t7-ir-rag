# COMBINE HARVESTER

## Abstract
In a combine harvester 1 including a base wall 11 onto which the product is fed and a conveyor roll 10 located above the base wall 11 to move the product over this wall, the base wall 11 includes a flap 12 which can be opened downwardly to discharge any excess product or foreign bodies collected by the harvester 1 onto the ground. Means 14, 15, 16 are provided for locking the flap 12 in its closed position. The flap 12 moves freely towards its open position from the closed position when it is unlocked by the force exerted by the excess product or foreign bodies.
