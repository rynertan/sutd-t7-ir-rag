# Electromagnetic relay.

## Abstract
An electromagnetic relay comprising a bobbin 1 on which a winding 11 is wound, a base block 2 on which an armature 51 and contact elements 6,7 are mounted, an approximately U shaped magnetic pole piece 3 , and an approximately U shaped yoke piece 4 . The long tongues 32, 42 of the magnetic pole piece 3 and the magnetic yoke piece 4 are inserted into the bobbin 1 , while the short tongues 31, 41 of the magnetic pole piece 3 and the magnetic yoke piece 4 are inserted with a gap into the base block 2 . When the armature 51 is attracted to the faces 33 and 43 of the pole and yoke pieces, a movable contact 52b is shifted between contact elements 6 and 7 whose ends are located by abutments 23 and 24.
