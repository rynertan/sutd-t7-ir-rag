# A method of and apparatus for monitoring platelet aggregation and test cell for use in such method and apparatus.

## Abstract
Aggregation of blood platelets is detected by using a test cell 1 which contains two electrodes 4a,4b which extend into the sample. So as to maximise the change in resistance between the electrodes which occurs as platelets aggregate on them, they are each rod shaped and of not more than about 0.25 mm in diameter. The resistance between the elec trodes is detected using an AC signal to avoid polarisation effects. The test cell may be constructed so as to be a disposable item.
