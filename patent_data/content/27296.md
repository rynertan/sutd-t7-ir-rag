# A sieve device for separating a mixture of particulate material in components of different sizes.

## Abstract
A sieve device for separating a mixture of particulate material in components of different sizes, comprising a perfo rated sieve surface that rotates around a central, vertical shaft, said sieve surface having the shape of a hollow, truncated cone casing with a downwardly directed top, on which an imperforate distributor cone with an upwardly directed top has been mounted in the middle, of which distributor cone the basis connets to the sieve surface, whereas the supply of the mixture to be separated takes place via a central supply tube placed above the distributor cone, whereas the removal of the coarse component takes place near the circumference of the sieve surface. The novel device comprises at least one additional sieve surface 16 , of which the diameter of the perforations differs from that of the former sieve surface 8 , which additional sieve surface 16 is displacable between a non operative pos ition, in which it is removed from the former sieve surface 8 and cannot receive mixture, and an operative position, in which it is placed on top of the former sieve surface 8 and can receive the supply of mixture.
