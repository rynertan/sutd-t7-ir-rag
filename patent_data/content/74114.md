# Catheter.

## Abstract
A catheter 12 including a support 40 suitable for insertion into a body organ, a transducer 50 carried by the support, the transducer 50 including a flexible piezoelectric polymeric membrane 52 , and a pair of surface electrodes 54, 56 mounted on the membrane 52 , the support 40 including a rigid portion defining a flexure cavity 58 inside the catheter 12 , the membrane 52 being mounted on the rigid support portion 40 to permit free flexing of the membrane 52 into and out of the cavity 58 , one surface of the membrane 52 communicating with the cavity 58 , the other surface of the membrane 52 being exposed to the exterior of the catheter 12 to receive and flex in response to pressure variations in the organ, and means 60, 62 for transmitting from the electrodes 54, 56 to external circuitry electrical signals produced by said flexure.
