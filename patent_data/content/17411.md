## Description
This invention relates to therapeutic agents which are novel derivatives of phthalazine, and is particularly concerned with such derivatives having a substituted piperidino group in the 1position. The compounds of the invention are phosphodiesterase inhibitors and cardiac stimulants of which a preferred class selectively increase the force of myocardial contraction without producing significant increases in heart rate. The compounds are useful in the curative or prophylactic treatment of cardiac conditions, in particular heart failure. According to the invention there are provided novel phthalazine compounds of the formula EMI1.1 wherein is is a C C alkyl group and Y is a group of thr formula CH2 m Z wherein m is 1 or 2 and Z is a group selected from OCONR R4, N Rê COR , N Rê SO2R , N Rê CONR R4, N Rê SO2NR R4, and N Rê COOR , wherein Rê and R4 are each independently hydrogen or C1 C4 alkyl, and R3 is C3 C7 cycloalkyl and the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof. Where appropriate, the alkyl groups may be straight or branched chain. The pharmaceutlcally acceptable acid addltion salts of the compounds of the invention are those formed from acids which form non toxic acid addition salts containing pharmaceutically acceptable anions, such as the hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, sulphate or bisulphate, phosphate or acid phosphate, acetate, maleate, fumarate, lactate, tartrate, citrate, gluconate, saccharate and p toluenesulphonate salts. The cardiac stimulant activity of the compounds of the invention is shown by their effectiveness in one or more of the following tests a increasing the force of contraction in the isolated, spontaneously beating, guinea pig double atria or kitten right and left atria preparations b increasing myocardial contractility left ventricular dP dt max. in the anaesthetised cat or dog with a left ventricular catheter c increasing myocardial contractility in the conscious dog with an implanted left ventricular transducer. In test a the positive inotropic and chronotropic responses of the atria to the test compound are measured at sevdoses and compared with the responses elicited by iso prenaline. The comparison of the dose response curves obtained gives a measure of the force versus rate selectivity of the test compound. In test b the positive inotropic action of the test compound following intravenous administration is measured in the anaes thetisAd cat or dog.The magnitude and duration of this action, and the selectivity for increase in force versus frequency of contraction of the test compound are obtained, as are its peripheral effects, e.g. the effect on the blood pressure. In test c the positive inotropic action of the test compound following intravenous or oral administration to a conscious dog with an implanted left ventricular transducer is measured. The magnitude of the inotropic action, the selectivity for increase in force versus frequency of contraction, and the duration of action of the inotropic effect of the test compound are all obtained. The preferred compounds of the invention have the formula EMI4.1 wherein Y is as defined for formula I . Preferably Rê and R4 are each independently hydrogen or methyl. Preferably R is a C3 C6 cycloalkyl group. Z is preferably selected from the following a 0.CON R4 cyclohexyl wherein R4 is H or CH3 b N CH3 COR wherein R is C3 C6 cycloalkyl c N CH3 SO2R wherein R is cyclopropyl, cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl d N CH3 CONR R4 wherein R3 is cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl and R is H or CH3, e N CH3 SO2NH.R wherein R3 is cyclopropyl or cyclohexyl and f N Rê COO.cyclohexyl wherein Rê is H or CH3. In the preferred individual compounds, RÚ is CH3 and Y is selected from CH2CH2N CH3 CON CH3 cyclopentyl, CH2CH2N CH3 CO.cyclopentyl and CH2CH2N CH3 SO2NH.cyclohexyl. The compounds of the invention can be administered alone but will generally be administered in admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier selected with regard to the intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. For example they may be administered orally in the form of tablets containing such excipients as starch or lactose, or in capsules either alone or in admixture with excipients, or in the form of elixirs or suspensions containing flavouring or colouring agents.They may be injected parenterally, for example, intravenously, intramuscularly or subcutaneously. For parenteral administration, they are best used in the form of a sterile aqueous solution which may contain other solutes, for example, enough salts or glucose to make the solution isotonic. For administration to man in the curative or prophylactic treatment of cardiac conditions such as congestive heart failure, it is expected that oral dosages of the most active compounds of the invention will be in the range from 20 mg to 1 g daily, taken in 2 to 4 divided doses per day, for an average adult patient 70 kg . Dosages for intravenous administration would be expected to be within the range 1 to 300 mg per single dose as required, for example in the treatment of acute heart failure. Thus for a typical adult patient, individual tablets or capsules might contain from 5 to 250 mg of active compound, in a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle or carrier. Thus the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the formula I as defined above or pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof together with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier. The invention also provides a method of stimulating the heart of an animal1 including a human being, which comprises administering to the animal a compound of the formula I or salt thereof as defined above, or a pharmaceutical composition as defined above, in an amount sufficient to stimulate the heart of the animal. The invention yet further provides a compound of the formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof for use in treating an animal, including a human being, to stimulate the heart of the animal. The compounds of the invention may be prepared by a number of routes Route A Compounds of the formula I may be prepared by reacting an appropriately substituted phthalazine of the formula EMI7.1 wherein QI represents a facile leaving group such as chloro , bromo , iodo , lower alkoxy or lower alkyl thio, with an amine of the formula EMI7.2 with resultant elimination of HQ . Q is preferably chloro or bromo. In a typical procedure the phthalazine III and piperidine IV are heated together in a suitable solvent, e.g.ethanol, in the presence of a base such as triethylamine for up to about 72 hours. The mixture may then be concentrated in vacuo, the residue dissolved in a suitable solvent, e.g. chloroform, washed with water, dried and concentrated in vacuo. The resulting oil in a suitable solvent, e.g. ethyl acetate, can then be chromatographed on e.g. a..silica column, the column being eluted with e.g. ethylacetate 5 ether then ethyl acetate. Appropriate fractions are collected, concentrated in vacuo, and e.g. the oxalate salt precipitated by the addition of excess oxalic acid in isopropanol to a solution of the crude product in the same solvent. The salt may be recrystallised to purity from a suitable solvent, e.g. isopropanol. The starting materials of the formulae III and IV are either known compounds or may be prepared by procedures analogous to those of the prior art, e.g. as follows EMI9.1 This process can also be carried out using an isocyanate 3 of the formula R .NCO in place of phenyl isocyanate. EMI9.2 This process can also be carried out using an amine of the formula RX NE in place of Ph.NHR4. 1,1 Carbonyldiimidazole may be used in place of phosgene.EMI9.3 EMI10.1 EMI11.1 The preparation of 1 chloro 6,7 dimethoxyphthalazine is described in Preparation 3 of published British Patent Application No.2000136A. Routes a to h above are illustrated in detail in thePreparations hereinafter.Route B Compounds of the formula I in which Y is CH2 mN Rê CONHR may be prepared by reacting a phthalazine of the formula EMI12.1 with an isocyanate of the formula R3NCO. In a typical procedure the isocyanate in a suitable solvent e.g.. chloroform is added dropwise to the phthalazine in a suitable solvent, e.g. dry chloroform, with stirring and cooling.After stirring at room temperature for 1 3 hours the reaction mixture can be concentrated in vacuo, triturated with e.g. ethyl acetate and filtered. The resultant solid may be purified by conventional techniques. The starting materials of the formula V are either known compounds or may be prepared by procedures analogous to those of the prior art. The preparation of 6,7 dimethyl 1 4 2 methylamino ethyl piperidino phthalazine and 6,5 dimetoxy 1 4 methylaminomethyl piper idino phthalazine is for example described in Preparation 10 of our published British Patent Application No. 2008104A. Similarly the isocyanates of he formula R3NCO are either known compounds or may be prepared by procedures analogous to the prior art, e.g. by the reaction of the corresponding amine with phosgene in the presence of triethylamine.Route C Compounds of the formula I in whith Y is CH2 mN Rê COR or CH2 mN Rê SO2R may be prepared by reacting a compound of the formula V as described in Route B with, as appropriate, an acylating agent of the formula R COCl, R COBr, R CO 2O, R SO2Cl or R SO2Br. In a typical procedure, the acid or sulfonyl halide in a suitable solvent, e.g. dry chloroform, is added dropwise to a solution of the phthalazine and a base such as triethylamine in a suitable solvent, e.g. dry chloroform, with stirring and cooling. After further stirring at room temperature for 1 3 hours the resulting mixture can be shaken with water, the organic phase dried, and concentrated in vacuo. The resulting oil can be chromatographed by a procedure similar to that described in Route A. The product of the chromatographic purification can again be converted to an oxalate salt as described in Route A. n Butyl lithium may for example be used in place of triethylamine, in which case it is recommended that tetrahydrofuran should be used instead of chloroform.
