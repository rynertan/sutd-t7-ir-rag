# Device for deboning meat.

## Abstract
A method and a device for deboning meat such as hams and shoulders, by bringing them under pressure in a press while allowing sideways escape for the meat transversely to the pressing direction, so that by the pressure the meat is loosened from the bones and moves sideways while the bones are retained between the opposite cooperating pressing surfaces at least one of said cooperating pressing surfaces 9 having means 10 conforming in shape to the shape of the bones. Preferably said pressing surface has a recess 10 sub stantially conforming to the shape of the bones, while said pressing surface is of an elastically deformable material and is supported in the press while leaving a free space between it and its support, so that the elastically deformable material enters this free space when being deformed by the bones in the meat during pressing, said recess may have a total volume about equal to the volume of the bone s in the meat, but a depth in the pressing direction smaller than the thicker parts of the bones, and an extension perpendicular to the pressing direction wider than the width of the bones in the same direction.
