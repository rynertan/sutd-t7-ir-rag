# Speed detectors.

## Abstract
A speed detector has a toothed wheel 11, with regu larly spaced teeth 11b, rotatable on a shaft 11a. A sensor 12 having a permanent magnet 12a, a pole piece 12b and a detection coil 12c is arranged so that as the wheel 11 rotates successive teeth 11b confront pole piece 12b and cause the coil 12c to generate a detection signal DS‚ÇÅ of a frequency dependent upon the speed of rotation of wheel 11. A second sensor 13, similar to sensor 12, is arranged so that successive teeth 11b confront its pole piece 13b as the wheel 11 rotates. The sensor 13 is placed so that when pole piece 12b of sensor 12 directly confronts a tooth 11b, pole piece 13b of sensor 13 is displaced from direct con frontation with a tooth 11b by an angular distance equi valent to 1 4 the pitch of the teeth of wheel 11. The direc tion of rotation of wheel 11 can be determined from the relationship between detection signals from coil 12c of sensor 12 and coil 13c of sensor 13.
