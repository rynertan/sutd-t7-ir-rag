# PROCESS FOR MAKING EMULSIONS OF SEQUENTIAL POLYMER PARTICLES USEFUL AS OPACIFIERS IN COATING OR IMPREGNATING COMPOSITIONS

## Abstract
Sequential core shell polymer particles are made by emulsion polymerization using free radical initiator, the core monomer system comprising at least 5 amine monomer and the core particles having an average diameter of 0.05 to 1 micron, the shell monomer system comprising monomer having no ionizable group and no more than 10 by weight amine monomer, the proportion of amine in the sheath monomer being less than 1 3 the proportion thereof in the core monomer. The weight of the core is 1 4 to 1 100 of the total particles, the sheath has a T
