# Disposable markers adapted for constant width and close proximity tracing.

## Abstract
A convenient disposable marker tip design which minimizes marker passing distance and provides a con stant width trace line independent of the angle at which the marker tip engages the writing surface. Each marker tip comprises a nib shank 20 , surrounding and support ing a nib 100 having a partially spherical tip 120 . The nib shank is shaped 60 to provide maximum coverage of the nib surface and minimum passing distance be tween adjacent nib tips 100, 101, 102 .
