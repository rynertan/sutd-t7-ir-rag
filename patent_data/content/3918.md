# Image focusing system and reprographic camera including such a system.

## Abstract
The invention concerns an image focusing system for use in a reprographic camera. To improve the compactness of such a camera, it is known to provide a reflecting element to fold the optical axis extending from an object plane to the image plane. The known disposition of the reflecting element between a focusing lens system and the image plane necessitates a very large reflecting surface area to satisfy the usual operational requirements of the aperture and field angle. This precludes the use of prisms as the reflecting element, and therefore introduces instability where image reversal is required since a roof mirror, in which the roof angle may drift, must be used. It is proposed to arrange the reflecting element 3 within the focusing lens system, i.e. between two lens assemblies 4 to permit smaller elements, and more particularly interchangeable plane and roof reflector prisms, to be used.
