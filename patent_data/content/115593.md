# Photo transducer circuit.

## Abstract
A photo transducer circuit 30 selectively controls the current which is transmitted between power terminals 32, 34 . A light emitter 20 transmits light to a first photo re ceiver 24 and a second photo receiver 26 . A vane 16 is movable by a Bourdon tube 12 to permit a variable amount of light to pass from the photo emitter 20 to the photo receiver 26 . The output of the photo emitter 20 is re gulated by a circuit which monitors the output of the photo receiver 24 . Circuitry is provided to set a minimum current flow between the power terminals 32, 34 when the vane 16 substantially blocks illumination of the photo receiver 26 . Further circuitry is provided to set a maximum current flow between the power terminals 32, 34 when the vane 16 allows substantial exposure of the photo receiver 26 to the light produced by emitter 20 . The current passed between the power terminals 32, 34 is proportional to the degree of blockage of the light from the emitter 20 directed toward the photo receiver 26 .
