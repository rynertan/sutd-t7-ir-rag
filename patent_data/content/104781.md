# Reception signal processing apparatus in nuclear magnetic resonance diagnostic apparatus.

## Abstract
Reception signal processing apparatus in nuclear magnetic resonance diagnostic apparatus to display as an image the distribution of the spin density or relaxation time of specific atomic nuclei existing in an object utilizing nuclear magnetic resonance phenomena including a phase demod ulator for phase demodulating a nuclear magnetic resonance signal evoked by nuclear magnetic resonance phenomena in accordance with two reference waves, the phases of which are different by 90 , an analog to digital convertor for digitalizing the separated two signals obtained by the phase demodulator, and a noise correction processor for eliminat ing the low frequency component noises included in the demodulated signals from the phase demodulator to obtain an image without artifacts.
