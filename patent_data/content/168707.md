## Description
TTTLE OF THE INVENTION 1 METHYLCARBAPENEMS HAVING A 2 QUATERNARYHETEROARYLALKYLTHIO SUBSTITUENT BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention is concerned with improved carbapenem antibiotics characterized by having a monocyclic or bicyclic. quaternary heteroarylalkylthio substituent in the 2 position and a methyl group in the l position.

The antibacterials of the invention are not limited to utility as medicaments they may be used in all manner of industry, for example additives to animal feed, preservation of food. disinfectants, and in other industrial systems where control of bacterial growth is desired.For example, they may be employed in aqueous compositions in concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 100 parts of antibiotic per million parts of solution in order to destroy or inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria on medical and dental equipment and as bactericides in industrial applications, for example in water based paints and in the white water of paper mills to inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria. The products of this invention may be used in any of a variety of pharmaceutical preparations.They may be employed in capsule. powder form, in liquid solution. or in suspension. They may be administered by a variety of means those of principal interest include topically or parenterally by injection intravenously or intramuscularly . Compositions for injection, a preferred route of delivery, may be prepared in unit dosage form in ampules, or in multidose containers. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions.solutions, or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for reconstitution. at the time of delivery, with a suitable vehicle. such as sterile water. Topical applications may be formulated in hydrophobic or hydrophilic bases as ointments. creams. lotions.paints, or powders. The dosage to be administered depends to a large extent upon the condition and size of the subject being treated as well as the route and frequency of administration the parentecal route by injection being preferred for generalized infections. Such matters. however, are left to the routine discretion of the therapist according to principles of treatment well known in the antibiotic art. In general. a daily dosage consists of from about 5 to about 600 mg of active ingredient per kg. of body weight of the subject in one or more treatments per day. A preferred daily dosage for adult humans lies in the range of from about 10 to 240 mg. of active ingredient per kg. of body weight.Another factor influencing the precise dosage regimen. apart from the nature of the infection and peculiar identity of the individual being treated. is the molecular weight of the chosen species of this invention I . The compositions for human delivery per unit dosage. whether liquid or solid. may contain from 0.1 to 99 of active material, the preferred range being from about 10 60 . The composition will generally contain from about 15 mg. to about 1500 mg.of the active ingredient however. in general, it is preferable to employ a dosage amount in the range of from about 250 mg to 1000 mg. In parenteral administration. the unit dosage is usually the pure compound I in sterile water solution or in the form of a soluble powder intended for solution. The preferred method of administration of the formula I antibiotic is parenteral by i.v.infusion, i.v. bolus, or i.m. injection. For adults, 5 50 mg of Formula I antibiotic per kg of body weight given 2. 3. or 4 times per day is preferred. Preferred dosage is 250 mg to 1000 mg of the Formula I antibiotic given two b.i.d. three t.i.d. or four q.i.d. times per day. More specifically, for mild infections, and particularly urinary tract infections. a dose of 250 mg t.i.d. or q.i.d. is recommended. For moderate infections against highly susceptible gram positive and gram negative organisms. a dose of 500 mg t.i.d. or q.i.d.is recommended. For severe. life threatening infections against organisms at the upper limits of sensitivity to the antibiotic. a dose of 1000 t.i.d.or q.i.d. is recommended. For children. a dose of 5 25 mg kg of body weight given 2. 3, or 4 times per day is preferred a dose of 10 mg kg t.i.d. or q.i.d. is usually recommended. Antibiotic compounds of Formula I are of the broad class known as carbapenems or l carbadethiapenems. Certain of these carbapenems are susceptible to attack by a renal enzyme known as dehydropeptidase DHP . This attack or degradation may reduce the efficacy of the carbapenem antibiotic.Inhibitors of DHP and their use with carbapenem antibiotics are disclosed in the prior art see published European Patent Applications No. 79102616.4 filed July 24. 1979 patent no. 10573 79102615.6, filed July 24, 1979 application no. 15573 and No.82107174.3, filed August 9, 1980 application no.72014 . The present I compounds may, where DHP inhibition is desired or necessary, be combined or used with the appropriate DHP inhibitor as described in the aforesaid published applications. Thus, to the extent that the cited European patent applications 1. define the procedure for determining DHP susceptibility of the present carbapenems and 2. disclose suitable inhibitors, combination compositions and methods of treatment, they are incorporated herein by reference. A preferred weight ratio of I compound DHP inhibitor in the combination compositions is about 1 1.

The reaction is conducted at 0 C to 400C for 0.5 to 5 hours under 1 100 atmospheres of hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst such as 10S palladium on carbon or 20S palladium hydroxide on carbon. The final products are purified by ion exchange chromatography and or reverse phase chromatography.When a pharmaceutically acceptable ester of the final product is desired, the deblocking step is omitted and the appropriate R group is incorporated into the starting material.

After addition, the solution was allowed to warm to room temperature. The reaction flask was fitted with a reflux condenser and the solution heated to reflux. After ca. 10 minutes of reflux rapid evolution of brown nitrogen oxides occurred. The solution was heated an additional 5 minutes and allowed to cool to room temperature. The solution was concentrated under water aspiration to ca. 3 ml and mixed with methanol 3 ml followed by acetone 50 ml to precipitate a white solid which was recovered by filtration.
