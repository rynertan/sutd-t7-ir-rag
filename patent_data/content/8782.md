## Description
THICK FILM SILVER CONDUCTOR COMPOSITIONS RESISTANT TOFISSURING DURING OVERGLAZING, PROCESS FOR PROVIDINGOVERGLAZE FOR FIRED METALLIZATIONS AND AC PLASMA DISPLAYPANEL COMPRISING TWO OVERGLAZED SUBSTRATES Technical Field This invention relates to thick film silver conductor compositions and more particularly to conductor compositions containing anti fissuring materials. Background Art Noble metal metallizing compositions are well known in the art. U.S. 3,450,545, issued June 17, 1969 to K. H.Ballard, et al. discloses compositions containing noble metals, an inorganic binder, an oxide precursor additive selected from rhodium, iridium, ruthenium, copper, silicon carbide and boron nitride, and a vehicle. The additive is said to increase the joint strengths of the metallizings and the resistance to fissuring during firing of the compositions. Direct screen printing of thick film electrodes is described in, e.g., H. J. Hoehn, SID, International Symposium Digest, 1977, pages 18 19. Their utilization for AC plasma display panels necessitates the use of a dielectric overglaze over the electrodes. The statement is made, however, that materials such as silver are destroyed by the high temperature required for curing the overglaze. There exists a need for screen printable thick film compositions useful in forming electrodes for AC plasma display panels which can be printed with high resolution and which can withstand high temperatures for the long time periods necessary for firing the dielectric overglaze. Disclosure of the Invention The thick film silver conductor compositions of this invention can provide fine line electrodes the fired metallizations are resistant to fissuring during subsequent overglazing. The compositions consist essentially of A 50 85 by weight, based on the weight of the composition, of silver particles having a particle size range of 0.05 20 micrometers B 1 10 by weight, based on the weight of the composition, of inorganic nonrglass forming refractory materials or their precursors, such as aluminum oxide, copper oxide, cadmium oxide, gadolinium oxide, zirconium oxide, cobalt iron chromium oxide, aluminum and copper, having a particle size range of 0.05 44 micrometers with at least 80 by weight of the particles in the 0.1 5 micrometer range C 5 20 by weight, based on the weight of the composition, of glass frit having a softening point range of 325 6000C such as lead borosilicate based glass and D 10 30 by weight, based on the weight of the composition, of vehicle such as a W polymerizable solution of polymethyl methacrylate and a polyfunctional monomer or a non UV polymerizable solution of ethyl cellulose. The process of providing an overglaze for fired metallizations comprises the steps of A printing and drying or drying and curing onto a substrate the silver composition of this inven tion B firing the product from step A and C applying an overglaze composition over the fired metallization and firing at a temperature and for a time sufficient to produce a clear, smooth, transparent coating. AC plasma display panels of this invention are based on substrates having fired metallizations thereon and coated with an overglaze. The fired metallizations are based on the silver composition of this invention.The overglaze is provided by the process of this invention described above. Two such overglazed substrates are sealed together face to face, the space between the two portions is evacuated and then filled with inert gas. Description of the Invention The thick film composition of this invention contains 50 85 by weight of finely divided silver particles. These particles can range in size from 0.05 20 micrometers micron and can be random or flake in shape. For compositions which have UV polymerizable vehicles, the silver particle size range is 0.3 10 micron majority 1 5p and the particles are random in shape. Compositions which have non UV polymerizable vehicles can tolerate the very fine particles which could otherwise function as a UV screen. A preferred conpositioncontains 66 silver particles by weight of the fully formulated thick film paste the particles having a surface area of 0.34 m2 g, as measured by a gas adsorption method and a size range of 0.3 10 microns majority in the approximately 1 5 micron range , as measured by scanning electron microscopy. The conductor composition of this invention contains 1 10 by weight of finely divided inorganic par ticulate non glass forming materials which are refractory or their precursors. These materials include, among others aluminum oxide, copper oxide, cadmium oxide, gadolinium oxide, zirconium oxide, cobalt iron chromium oxide, aluminum and copper. These oxides or oxide precursors have a particle size range of 0.05 44 micrometers, with at least 80 by weight of the particles in the 0.1 5 micrometer range, and are an essential component of the conductor compositions. The presence of these refractory materials in the compositions of this invention unexpectedly allowed the utilization of silver based metallizations in AC plasma display panels by increasing the resistance of the fired metallizations to fissuring during the overglazing process. Although the mechanism of such anti fissuring action is not known for sure, it is thought that these anti fissuring agents coat or surround the metal particles thereby retarding their sintering together and inhibiting their withdrawal from the glass phase, a phenomenon which would result in fissuring. A preferred anti fissuring agent is alumina, present to an extent of 2.6 by weight of a fully formulated preferred composition. In this composition the alumina has a surface area of 10.6 m2 g and a particle size of 0.65p at the 50 point i n a sedimentation test. The anti fissuring composition of this invention also contains 5 20 by weight of glass frit having a softening point range of 325 6000C. Preferred glass frits include the lead borosilicate type glasses an especially preferred composition is mole PbO 53.1 , B203 2.9 , SiO2 29.0 , TiO2 3.0 , ZrO2 3.0 , ZnO 2.0 , Na2O 3.0 , andCdO 4.0 . The glasses can be prepared by conventional glass making techniques, by mixing the desired components or precursors thereof, e.g., H3303 forB203 in the desired proportions and heating the mixture to form a melt. As is well known in the art, heating is conducted to a peak temperature and for a time such that the melt becomes entirely liquid, yet gaseous evolution has ceased. In this work, the peak temperature is in the range llOO 15000C, usually 1200 1400 C. The melt is then fritted particles are made by cooling the melt, typically by pouring onto a cold belt or into cold running water. Particle size reduction can then be accomplished by milling as desired. The above mentioned lead borosilicate glass is prepared by melting the appropriate ingredients at 13500C followed by fritting and ball milling and has 0 a softening point of 580 590 C. The composition of this invention further contains 10 30 by weight of a vehicle in which the particulate materials are dispersed. Depending on the method of application of the compositions and the method of obtaining the fine line metallizations, the vehicle can be UV polymerizable or non W polymerizable. An example of a UV polymerizable vehicle is a solution of polymethyl methacrylate and a polyfunctional monomer. The monomer should have low volatility in order to minimize its evaporation during the preparation of the paste and the printing rying steps prior to W curing. The vehicle can also contain solvents and, in the case of the UV curable vehicles, W sensitive initiators. A preferred W polymerizable vehicle contains a polymer based on methyl methacrylate ethyl acrylate 95 5 by weight , having an inherent viscosity as determined as a solution of 0.25 gram of polymer in 50 milliliters of chloroform, at 250C using a No. 50Cannon Fenske Viscometer, of 0.45, and polyoxyethylated trimethylpropane triacrylate having a total of approximately 20 units of incorporated ethylene oxide. A preferred non W polymerizable vehicle is based on ethyl cellulose. Suitable solvents for the vehicles include butyl carbitol acetate and beta terpineol. Additionally, the vehicles can also contain dispersing agents, stabilizers, etc. The compositions can be applied to glass substrates in a conventional manner, a preferred mode being screen printing. In case of silver compositions based on UV polymerizable vehicles, the composition can be screen printed, dried, exposed to UV radiation through a patterned photomask, and treated with solvent to remove unexposed areas. The patterned glass substrate is then fired resulting in a well defined fine line pattern having excellent density and high conductivity. The glass substrate can be sheet or pulled glass and, also, float glass. Preferably, soda lime sheet glass is utilized. When float glass is utilized, a surface etching step is performed. The fired metallizations of this invention are useful in the process of obtaining clear, smooth, and transparent dielectric overglaze over the patterned and fired glass subtrates. The silver conductor lines remain well adhered to the substrate showing no breaks or fissure upon the completion of this process. The overglaze composition preferably utilized in the process of this invention contains a glass frit of the composition mole PbO 68.2 , SiO2 12.0 ,B203 14.1 , and CdO 5.7 , having a softening point of approximately 4800C. The overglaze composition, dispersed in an ethyl cellulose based vehicle, is screen printed over the fired conductor, dried, and then fired at a temperature and for a time sufficient to produce a clear, smooth coating. The AC plasma display panels of this invention are based on glass substrates having patterned and fired metallizations coated by a dielectric overglaze. The fired metallizations are based on the thick film conductor compositions of this invention.The process of coating with an overglaze is described above. A sequence of steps in preparing AC plasma display panels is as follows The thick film electrodes are optically inspected for electrode breaks, shorts and other defects. To the extent possible, the defects are repaired. Thick film pads are screen printed over the thick film silver on the two opposite ends of each substrate in the connector pad area. These screen printed pads can be 90 micrometers or less wide.Alternate electrodes are brought out opposite sides of the panel in an inter lace fashion. A vitreous lead borosilicate glass as described above can be used for the dielectric overglaze. The glass frit mixed with suitable vehicles and formed into a paste is screen printed over the entire display area of each substrate. Glass rod spacers are placed in the wet dielectric at appropriate positions between electrodes on each back substrate.The dielectric is cured in a uniform temperature, belt driven oven. Since the dielectric cure temperature is above the strain point of the glass substrate, precautions must be taken to avoid substrate warping.The substrates are placed on flat support plates and the oven belt speed and temperature zones are adjusted so that the substrates are heated and cooled very slowly. Following curing, the dielectrics are visually inspected, electrode continuity and resistance are measured electrically and dielectric thickness and substrate flatness are measured on a random sampling basis. The conductor lines are uniform in line width and are not pitted or broken, have high conductivity, optical clarity and transparency between lines. A devitrifying solder glass is used for sealing together the two printed and overglazed substances. After screen printing the seal, the parts are placed in an oven and fired at a low temperature to burn out the sealing glass binders and harden the seal. A thin film coating is then deposited over the entire glass dielectric. One back and one front substrate are then aligned orthogonally and clamped together. A small amount of solder glass paste is placed on the end of an appendage tube which is then positioned in a hole in the back substrate. The assembly is then placed in an oven and the parts are sealed together. The appendage of each assembly is sealed onto the manifold of a gas process station. The panels are evacuated, baked out and back filled with a gas mixture of, e.g., neon and xenon. The panels are then tipped off the vacuum station. Each panel is aged until stabilized. These panels can be tested, attached to connector cables, and inserted in display units. The silver compositions of this invention can also be utilized to fabricate multilayer inventions In the Example below, illustrating the invention, all parts are by weight unless otherwise indicated.
