# Method and apparatus for filling containers with liquid.

## Abstract
Equally spaced pusher bars 20 moving continuously around a closed path individually engage open top contain ers 13 and push them in single file through a filling region 14 where they are filled with liquid flowing freely in a continuous sheet from an elongated discharge edge 37 extending along the path above the open tops of the containers. A separate deflecting unit 38 is adjustably attached to each pusher bar 20 , each deflecting unit having an upwardly convex wedge shaped deflecting surface 39 . The deflecting units 38 move with the containers 13 through the filling region 14 , and the deflecting surfaces divide the continuous sheet of flowing liquid into a number of separate streams each directed into the interior of a respective container, thereby preventing the liquid from contacting the external surfaces of the containers.
