# APPARATUS FOR GENERATING A CONTROLLABLE STEAM AND OZONE MIXTURE AND HAIR DRYER FOR UNIFORMLY DISTRIBUTING SAID MIXTURE ON HAIR

## Abstract
The invention is concerned with an apparatus for generat ing steam and ozone, i.e. ozonized steam in a controllable quantity for the treatment of both skin and hair, wherein the steam generating boiler communicates at least by means of a nozzle with a mixing ozoning chamber wherein an ozone gen erating lamp is positioned. In addition the steam and ozone generation, the apparatus is provided with means for generat ing a cold and hot air flow, to be connected and controlled independently from the steam and ozone generation.
