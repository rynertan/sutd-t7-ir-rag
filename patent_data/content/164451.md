## Description
The present invention relates to an arithmetic processing unit, and more particularly to an arithmetic processing unit for processing floating point data. A floating point data is represented by an exponent part and a mantissa part. That is, data A is represented by M x 2 As described above, the conventional arithmetic unit as disclosed in the EP 0 051 422 A requires at least three different operations one is a first adjustment operation of the exponent parts for adjusting a scale of one exponent part to that of the other exponent part another operation is an arithmetic calculating operation of the mantissa parts and the other operation is a second adjustment operation of an exponent part according to the arithmetic calculation of the mantissa parts. These three operations must be sequentially executed along a time axis, because the second operation is depended on the result of the first operation and the third operation is depended on the result of the second operation. Therefore, at least three operation cycles are necessarily required, so that a high speed processing can not be effected. The conventional arithmetic processor carries out the third operation the second adjustment operation required to deal with an overflow or an underflow after the second operation the arithmetic operation of the mantissa parts has been completed. According to this operation flow, the additional time for the third operation is necessarily required. Therefore, no matter how speedly the arithmetic calculating operation the second operation may be performed with respect to the mantissa parts, a long period of time must be spent to complete the third operation the second adjustment operation , resulting disadvantageously in a reduction also in a floating point data processing efficiency as as whole. An object of the present invention is to provide an arithmetic processing unit which can perform a floating point arithmetic operation at a high speed. Another object of the present invention is to provide an arithmetic processing unit suitable to application where a high speed calculation is required. An arithmetic processing unit of the present invention according to claim 1 includes a first circuit for executing a first adjustment operation with respect to two exponent parts of two floating point data, a second circuit for executing an arithmetic calculating operation of two mantissa parts of the two floating data, a third circuit for executing an increment operation of an exponent part when the arithmetic operation of the mantissa parts is executed by the second circuit, and a fourth circuit for selecting either one of the exponent part which represents a data before the increment operation is executed or the exponent part which represents a data after the increment operation is executed by the third circuit according to the result of the arithmetic calculating operation of the second circuit. According to another embodiment of the present invention the increment operation which is executed after the arithmetic calculating operation in the prior art is executed in parallel with the arithmetic calculating operation by the third circuit. The output, that is the incremented exponent part, of the third circuit is selected by the fourth circuit only when an overflow arises in the result of the arithmetic calculating operation executed by the second circuit. When the overflow does not arise, the output of the third circuit is not selected. Instead of the output of the third circuit, the output of the first circuit is selected. This selecting operation can be performed at a high speed according to a carry signal transferred from the second circuit. Therefore, a result of an arithmetic calculation can be obtained in two operation cycles according to the present invention, because the third cycle of the prior art in which the increment operation is executed according to the carry signal is not required. Thus, a floating point arithmetic operation can be performed at a high speed according to the present invention. At first, the prior art arithmetic unit according to the EP 0 051 422 A will be described by referring to Fig. 1. Two floating point data A and B are transferred to an arithmetic unit through a bus 10, respectively. An exponent part E As above described, the prior art arithmetic unit requires at least three operations which are performed in series along a time axis to execute a floating point operation. It will be clearly understood that at least three subsequent cycles are spent in the prior art. In contrast, according to the embodiment of the present invention shown in Fig. 2, a floating point operation can be executed in only two cycles. In Fig. 2 an arithmetic unit includes the comparator 11 coupled to the bus 10 via the lines 1 and 2, the adder and shifter 12 coupled to the bus 11 via lines 3, 4 and 5 and the multiplexer 13 receiving the exponent parts E In the arithmetic unit, it is an important to provide the incrementer 24 at the previous portion of the selector 25. Thus, the increment operation which is executed after the carry signal has been applied to the incrementer 14 in Fig. 1 can be executed in parallel with the shifting and adding operations in the adder and shifter 12 without waiting reception of the carry signal. In other words, the incremented exponent part has been preliminarily prepared before the carry signal 16 is applied to the selector 25. That is, the second adjustment operation can be simultaneously performed with the arithmetic calculating operation for the mantissa parts. Therefore, a floating point operation can be executed at a high speed in only two cycles. A more detailed procedure of data A and B to be added is as follows In the abovedescribed steps 1 to 7 , the steps 1 to 4 are executed as the first operation in a first cycle. The remainder steps 5 to 7 are executed as the second and the third operations in a second cycle. Fig. 3 shows a timing chart of Figs. 1 and 2. a to d means the operations in the prior art of Fig. 1, and a to d means the operations in the embodiment of Fig. 2. As shown in Fig. 3, the first adjustment operation the first operation EXPONENT 1st OP. , the arithmetic calculating operation the second operation MANTISSA OP. and the second adjustment operation the third operation EXPONENT 2nd OP. are sequentially executed in the cycles t₁, t₂, and t₃ in the prior art. Thereafter, the result of the arithmetic operation is produced in a cycle t₄. In contrast, according to the present invention, the first adjustment operation is performed in the first cycle t₁. However, the arithmetic calculating operation and the second adjustment correcting is performed in the second cycle t₂. Thus the result of the arithmetic operation can be produced in the third cycle. It is easily understood that the present invention can be applied to a subtraction as well as the above described addition. Further, the respective operations of the comparator 11 and the incrementer 24 may be executed in a time division manner by the same circuit with adding and subtracting functions.
