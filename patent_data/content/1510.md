## Abstract
A pair of ceramic chips 56, 58 , formed of similar metal oxide ceramic materials which are semiconductors at elevated temperature, are connected electrically in series and are arranged for exposure to the hot gaseous combustion by products produced by an internal combustion engine. The chips are positioned in the exhaust gas conduit by a ceramic insulator 48 having a plurality of longitudinal passages extending therethrough. A plurality of electrical terminal members 60, 62, 64 are received within the rear of the longitudinal passages. Electrical leads 66, 68, 70, 72 extend from the chips 56, 58 to the terminal members 60, 62, 64 through the plurality of passages and support the chips while providing electrical communication between the chips and the electrical terminals. The electrical terminals 60, 62, 64 are adapted for communication to electronic and or electrical utilization means. One 58 of the pair of chips is processed to exhibit a rapid change in an electrical property responsive to differences in the exhaust gas chemistry and differences in exhaust gas temperature. The other 56 of the chips is processed to exhibit a rapid change in an electrical property responsive to differences in exhaust gas temperature only. The preferred material is titania. For temperatures in the range of from about 700 F to about 1500 F, the application of a reference voltage across the series connected chips 56, 58 will produce a substantially temperature independent voltage variation across either chip in response to changes in exhaust gas chemistry and which is relatively insensitive to changes in the exhaust gas temperature.
