# Method and apparatus for regulating the power supplied to an electrical load.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for regulating the power supplied to an electrical load with the degeneration of the voltage from a power source such as a battery. The regulating circuit 11, 14, 15, 16 maintains a constant luminous flux output from a lamp 17 over a substantial range of voltages by switching the voltage to the lamp on and off at a preselected and controlled duty cycle. The principal advantage of this regulation is that only the minimum energy necessary to produce a required minimum luminous flux is used from the power source 12 irrespective of its voltage value within the operative range. The power pulses applied to the lamp are of a voltage that varies directly as the voltage variations of the power source and widths that vary as the inverse square of the voltage from the power source for maintaining a constant RMS voltage on the lamp and thereby constant light output flux. The oscillating signal generator 11 for providing the power pulses is defined for sensing the power source output voltage variations and generates a fixed frequency signal having amplitudes varying between values directly related to the power source output voltages.
