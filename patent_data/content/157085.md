# Aqueous polyepoxide emulsions.

## Abstract
A room temperature curing emulsion coating com position is disclosed in which a solution of normally solid polyepoxide polymer having a 1,2 epoxy equivalency of at least 1.4 and a molecular weight up to about 2000 in inert volatile organic solvent is emulsified into water having dis solved therein a monosecondary amine containing at least one primary amine group which is ketimine blocked by reaction with a ketone which is hindered to prevent reaction with a secondary amino hydrogen atom, this hindered ketone being selected from the group consisting of noncy clic ketones containing one group selected from methyl or ethyl and a second group containing at least four carbon atoms, and cyclic ketones which are substituted in the alpha position. The monosecondary amine is dispersed in the water of the emulsion by at least 50 neutralization of amine functionality with a volatile solubilizing acid either as such or after reaction into a polymer by means of its second ary amino hydrogen atom.
