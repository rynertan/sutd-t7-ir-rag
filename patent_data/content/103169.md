# AIR FUEL RATIO SENSOR

## Abstract
An air fuel ratio sensor which includes at least one solid electrolyte plate 10, 12 made of a stabilized zirconia with first and second electrodes 14, 20 being provided separately on one surface of the electrolyte plate and a third electrode 16 being provided on an opposed surface of the solid electrolyte plate 10, 12 . The first and second elec trodes 14, 20 are covered with a porous ceramic layer and the third electrode 16 is covered with an air tight ceramic layer. A power source supplies the third electrode 16 with current in order to enable a heating of the electrolytic plate.
