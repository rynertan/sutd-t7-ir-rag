# FIBER OPTIC SPLICE ORGANIZER

## Abstract
A device and method for organizing a bight in an optical fiber at a splice or slack point, so as to both minimize the size of a container necessary to enclose that light and maximize the radius through which such fiber is bent, is provided. The method comprises laying the bight on a sheet in such a way that, when the sheet is wrapped about a cylindrical core, the radius of any bend in the fiber is greater than the minimum bending radius, and wrapping the sheet about the core. The method is suitable for both in line and butt splices, and provides ready means of fiber identification and encapsula tion.
