# Rotary device, apparatus and method for treating molten metal.

## Abstract
A rotary device for dispersing a gas in molten metal, for example argon in molten aluminium, contained in a vessel, comprises a hollow shaft 1 and a hollow rotor 2 fixedly attached to the shaft 1 , the rotor 2 having a plurality of vanes 4 each extending from the shaft 1 , or a location adjacent the shaft 1 , towards the periphery 5 of the rotor 2 whereby the hollow interior of the rotor 2 is divided into a plurality of compartments 6 , at least one aperture 8 in the top 7 or bottom of the rotor 2 adjacent the shaft 1 and at least one aperture 10 in the peripheral surface 9 of the rotor 2 such that when the rotor 2 rotates molten metal can enter each of the compartments 6 through the aperture or apertures 8 in the top 7 or bottom, and flow outwardly through the peripheral aperture or apertures 10 and at least one duct 12 for the passage of the gas extending from the hollow interior of the shaft 1 to each of said compartments 6 . The gas and molten metal are mixed together within the rotor 2 and on emerging from the rotor 2 the gas is dispersed throughout the body of the molten metal as a stream of very small bubbles.
