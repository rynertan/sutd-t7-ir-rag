# Turbulence inducing members.

## Abstract
A plastics turbulence inducing member 20 comprises a shaft portion 22 and a pair of helical ribs 24, 26 extend ing radially from the shaft portion. The rib 24 has a greater radial extent than the rib 26 and forms a close fit with a pipe 30 for a fluid in an air conditioning sys tem for example, while the rib 26 stops short of the wall of the pipe. The member 20 is thus held firmly in position and increased turbulence is induced, thereby enhancing the heat exchange efficiency.

## Description
Turbulence inducing members This invention relates to turbulence inducing members for insertion into a pipe for a fluid such as a refrigerant in various kinds of air conditioning systems for inducing turbulence in the flow of the fluid thereby enhancing the heat exchange efficiency There have been previous proposals for turbulence inducing members, such as those made of metal in the shape of a ribbon or in helical form and those made of a synthetic resin which is light in weight and easy to manufacture. French patent no 77.30460, for example, discloses a plastics turbulence inducing member which is provided with a pair of equal helical ribs and having its maximum outside diameter slightly smaller than the inside diameter of the pipe into which it is to be inserted.Since such a plastics turbulence inducing member is a loose fit in the fluid pipe, it vibrates within Ui fluid ipe in tie direction of fluid flow and or is otated around its axis by the flow of the fluid, which leads to a disadvantageous decrense in efficiency in the production of turbulence.When such a plasties turbulence inducing member is used in an air conditioning system fcr example, installed within a room, it rattles against the inner wall of thc fluid pipe due to the afore montioned vibration and or ro ation, thereby giving rise to noise Particularly when such an air conditioning system is operated at night, the noise resounds throughout the room and disturbs the occupants. The main object of the present invention is to provide a plastics turbulence inducing member which is neither vibrated nor rotated within the fluid pipe by the flow of the fluid, thereby preventing the generation of noise and enhancing the turbulence inducing efficiency. According to the present invention a plastics turbulence inducing member having at least two helical ribs is characterised in that one of the ribs has a radial extent different from that of the other rib or ribs. The invention will now be described in more tail, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figures 1 A and 1 B are longitudinal and cross sectional views respectively illustrating a conventional plastics turbulence inducing member which has been inserted into a fluid pipe Figure 2 is a side view illustrating one embodiment of a plastics turbulence inducing member according to the present invention Figure T A 3 B and C are cross tl al views of the turbluence indueing member of Figure 2, taken along lines A A, B B andC C in Figure 2, respectively Figure 4 i a longitudinal sectional view ill strating the turbulence indu ing member of Figure 2 inserted into a pipe and Figure 5 is a cross sectional view illustrating another embo limellt of turbulence inducing member according to the present invention. Figure 1 shows a conventional turbulence inducing member 10 maple of a synthetic resin and provided with two helical ribs 12 and 14 which are equal in radial extent. The turbulence inducing member 10 formed by the two ribs 12 and 14 has a maximum diameter which is slightly smaller than the inside diameter of a pipe 16 for fluid so that it may easily be inserted inte the pipe 16.For this renson, the turbulence inducing member 10 is vibrated in the dir ction in which the fluid flows and or rotated around its axis by the flow of th fluid, with the esult that the turbulence induced in the fluid is reduced by the amount of the vibrating movement and or rotating movement and, at the same time, the vibration and or rotation of the turbulence inducing member 10 allows the member to rattle against the inner wall of the pipe 10 to thereby make noise. The disadvantages suffered by the conventional turbulence inducing member are eliminated by the invention as will now be described with reference to the remaining Figures The turbulence inducing member 20 shown in Figures 2 and 3 comprises a shaft portion 22 and two helical ribs 24 and 26 of different radial extents which have curved leading end portions 24a and 26a, with pointed leading edges, The maximum width L of the turbulence inducing member 20 at any point is smaller than the inside diameter of a fluid pipe 50 to be described later However, the diameter of a circle P having a radius equal to the distance between the cen Erectf the shaft portion 22 and the outermost edge of the longer helical rib 24 is slighly larger than the inside diameter of tl fluid wipe 50 To show the shape of the turbulence inducing member 20 more, cross. sectional views f three portion of the turbulence inducing member taken at a given pitch are illustrated inFigures 3 A , 3 B and 3 C . The turbulence inducing member 20 is easily manufactured, though not illustrated, by rotatably attaching to an extruder a mouthpiece having an outiet of a shape identieal with the cross section of the turbulence inducing member, extruding a synthetic resin from the outlet while rotating the mouthpiece, helically twisting the synthetic resin while in a softened state between the mauthpiece and a cooling vess l by means of the rotation of the mouthpiece, passing the synthetic resin through water in the cooling vessel, the rahv ling and ha ing the sy h i resin, and drawing the synthetic resin from the cooling vessel. Optionally, the softened synthetic resin may be drawn by rotating the synthetic resin itself with the moiuthpiece fixed to the extruder. When the turbulence inducing member 20 is inserted in to the fluid pipe 30, the curved leading c lld pertloit 24a of the helical rib 24 comes into contact with the inner wall of the fluid pipe 30 along its helical pi tch. As the insertion proceeds, the shaft portion 22 is substantially helically deformed within the fluid pipe 30 as illustrated in Figure 4. Therefore, the. deformation of the shaft portion 22 urges the curved leading end portions 24a of the rib 24 to forcibly contact the iner wall of the fluid pipe 50.The turbulence inducing member 20 is thus retained fast within the fluid pipe 30 with the curved leading end portions 24a kept in intimate contact with the inner wall of the fluid pipe 30. Therefore, the turbulence inducing member 20 is neither vibrated in the direction in which the fluid flows nor rotated bout the shaft portion 22. When the turbulence inducing member 20 has been inserted into the fluid pipe 30, fit main part of the fluid within the pipe flows along the radially longer helical rib 2i and thc curved si.irfaces of the curved leading end portions 24a. On the other hand, part of the fluid flows as to ride over the urv leading nd portions 26a of the radially shorter helical rib 26 and continues to converge upon and diverge from the main fluid flow.Therefore, turbulence is promoted in the fluid. The turbulence inducing member just described has two helical rib, but the number of ribs is not limited to two. The turbulence inducing member may have three or more helical ribs at least one of which has a radial extent different from that of the remainder. An example of a turbulence inducing member having threc helical ribs 24, 26 and 28 is illustrated inFigure 5. Since a turbulence inducing member according to the present invention is held fast within the fluid pipe, it is possible to avoid completely either vibration or rotation of the turbulence inducing member within the fluid pipe due to the flow of the fluid and to effectively prevent the generation of noise due to the rattling of the turbulence inducing member against the inner wall of the fluid pipe, with the result that the turbulence efficiency can be kept high. Furthermore, since part of the fluid flow rides over the radially shorter helical rib and continues to converge upon and diverge from the main fluid flow, the turbulence efficiency can be promoted to a major extent. That is to say, the heat exchange efficiency can satisfactorily b enhanced.
