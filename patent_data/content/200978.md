# Static interferometric ellipsometer.

## Abstract
A static interferometric ellipsometer, wherein a zeeman effect laser 3 generates a coherent light beam with two mon ochromatic radiations at slightly different frequencies. A first photodetector 6 generates a first beat between the two radi ations, to be used as a reference. A second photodetector 9 generates a second beat between the two radiations, after they have been polarized in perpendicular planes and sepa rated so that one of them is reflected onto the photodetector 9 by the sample under test 1, 2 . A measuring and comput ing system 11 determines the optical properties of said sam ple starting from the intensity of the second beat and from the relative phase between the two beats.
