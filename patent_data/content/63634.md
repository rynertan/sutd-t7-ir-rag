## Description
Title TEERMOPLAST RESIN COIv OSITION This invention relates to a thermoplastic resin composition having much improved moldability and mechanical properties over a polycarbonate resin while retaining the inherent thermal stability of the polycarbonate resin.Nore specifically, this invention pertains to a thermoplastic resin composition comprising specified proportions of a polycarbonate resin and a rubber modified styrene maleic anhydride copolymer resin. Dhe rubber modified styrene maleic anhydride copolymer resin has superior thermal stability and good moldability, and therefore is widely used, and expected to be used, in various applic.tions, for example in automobiles, househo d electrical appliances, precision instruments, business machines and medical instruments Dhe polycarbonate resin, on the other hand, has high impact strength and superior thermal stability, but because of its too high a melt viscosity, its moldability is poor Moreover, its high impact strength extremely decreases as the thickness of a specimen of the resin is increased.For example, while the polycarbonate resin has an Izod impact strength, measured in accordance with ASTH D 256, of about 50 to about 100 kg cm cm with a 1 8 inch bar, the Izod impact strength of a 1 4 inch bar is only 8 to 15 kg cm cm. In order to improve the moldability of the polycarbonate resin, it was suggested, for example, to incorporate a polybutadiene t pe graft resin in the polycarbonate resin as described in Japanese Patent Publication No. 11496 1967, or to incorporate asphaltene in the polycarbonate rosin as described in Japanese PatentPublication im. 38655 1975 l By these methods, however, the problem of reduced impact strength cannot be entirely solved. It is an object of this invention therefore to provide a polycarbonate resin composition having superior mold ability and excellent impact strength particularly at increased thicknesses, without sacrificing the inherent superior thermal stability of the polycar bonate resin. We have now found that this object can be achieved by a polycarbonate resin composition obtained by mixing specified proportions of the polycarbonate resin and a rubber modified styrene maleic anhydride copolymer resin. Phuts, according to this invention, there is provided a thermoplastic resin composition comprising a 5 to 40 by weight of a rubber modified styrene maleic anhydride copolymer resin and b 95 to 60 by weight of a polycarbonate resin. The resin composition of the invention not only has equivalent thermal stability to the polycarbonate resin, but also exhibits excellent moldability represented by the fact that it requires a molding tern perature at least 200 C lower than the polycarbonate resin and a molding pressure at least 200 kg cmÃª lower than the polycarbonate resin. It is surprising, too, that while the rubber modified styrene maleic anhydride copolymer resin and the polycarbonate resin usually have an Izod impact strength of 5.5 and 8.9 kg cm cm, respectively, the resin composition of this invention has anIzod impact strength of at least 20 kg cm cm. The rubber modified styrene maleic anhydride copolymer a denotes a resin which is obtained by thermally polymerizing a rubber component, a styrene monomer and maleic anhydride in the presence of a chain transfer agent and a radical generator. The thermal polymerization is carried out, for example, by heating a mixture of styrene monomer and maleic anhydride monomer in a mole ratio of from 1.4 to 49, preferably from 4.6 to 1700, the rubber component, a known radical generator and a known chain transfer agent in a ketone solvent such as acetone and methyl isobutyl ketone at a tempera ture of 60 to 180 C, preferably 75 to 140 C.After the thermal polymerization, a poor solvent such as petroleum benzin and methanol is added to the reaction product to precipitate the desired rubber modified styrene maleic anhydride copolymer resin a . The precipitated copolymer resin a is used in the form of a powder, or in the form of pellets or granules. Typical examples of the rubber components are butadiene rubber, butadiene styrene rubber or butadieneacrylic rubber containing 60 to 95 by weight of butadiene, isoprene rubber, isoprene styrene rubber or isoprene acrylic rubber containing 60 to 95 by weight of isoprene, A IB type block rubber or A B A type block rubber of butadiene styrene containing 60 to 95 Sc by weight of butadiene, and ethylene propylene copolymer rubber PT . These components may be used singly or as a mixture of two or more. The rubber component is preferably contained in the finally obtained rubbermodified copolymer resin a in an amount of 2 to 250 by weight, especially about 5 to 12 by weight. The rubber modified styrene maleic anhydride copolymer resin a is suitably such that the styrene maleic anhydride copolymer portion left after removal of the grafted rubber polymer has an average molecular weight Mw measured by gel permeation chromatography, i.e., GPC based on a polystyrene standard method is preferably 100,000 to 400,000, especially preferably 150,000 to 300,000. The rubber polymer suitably has a glass transition temperature Tg , measured by an authorized method of differential scanning calorimetry, of preferably not more than OOr, especially preferably 300C to 1000 C, or suitably has an inherent viscosity, measured for a solu tion of 0.3 g of the rubber polymer in 1 deciliter of toluene, of preferably 0.9 to 2.5 dl g, especially preferably 0.9 to 1.7 dl g. Typical examples of the polycarbonate resin b are those obtained by the reaction of aromatic dihydroxy compounds with phosgene, and those obtained by the reaction of aromatic dihydroxy compounds with carbonate precursors such as diaryl carbonates. The aromatic dihydroxy compounds denote dihydroxy compounds having an aromatic group such as phenylene, biphenylene, naphthylene and anthrylene.Among them, bis hydroxyaryl alkanes are preferred.Typical examples of the bis hydroxyaryl alkanes are 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane commonly called bisphenolA , bis 4 hydroxyphenyl methane commonly called bisphenol F , 1,1 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl ethane, 2,2 bis 4 hydroxy 3, 5 dibromophenyl propane, 2, 2 bis 4 hydroxy 3,5 dichlorophenyl propane and various isomers thereof.These bis hydroxyaryl alkanes may be used singly or as a mixture of two or more. Suitable carbonate precursors are diaryl carbonates. Typical examples of the diaryl carbonates are diphenylene carbonate, di biphen,tlene carbonate, dinaphthylene carbonate and dianthrylene carbonate. They may be used either singly or as a mixture of two or more. Roughly, there are two methods of preparation of the polycarbonate resin b . One is called the phosgene method which comprises reacting diols with carbonyl halides such as phosgene, and the other is called the ester method or ester interchange method which comprises first preparing a carbonate precursor such as a diaryl carbonate, and reacting the precursor with a dill. Specifically, the polycarbonate resin b can be prepared by reacting an aromatic dihydroxy compound of the type examplified hereinabove with phosgene or the aforesaid diaryl carbonate in an organic solution containing a base such as pyridine, or by the method described in U.S. Patent Specification No. 3,028,365. The polycarbonate resin b suitably has a viscosity average molecular weight iso of preferably 10,000 to 70,000, more preferably 20,000 to 40,000, most preferably 25,000 to 35,000. the viscosity average molecular weight Mv is determined by measuring the intrinsic viscosity C of a solution of the resin in methylene chloride using an Ostwald viscomater, and calculating the viscosity average molecular weight from n 1.23 x 10 5 Mv0.83 expressing the relation between t3 and SMvd which is described in Angewandte Chemie , vol. 68, pp. 633 640 1956 . The composition of this invention can be prepared by blending S to 40 by weight of the rubbermodified styrene maleic anhydride copolymer resin a and 95 to 60 by weight of the polycarbonate resin b as main components by a known conventional blending method, namely by blending pellets with each or pellets with a powder in the heat molten state using a roll, aBanbury mixer or an extruder. If the ratio of the resin a to the resin b is less than 5 95 and the amount of the resin a is thus too small, the moldability and impact strength of the polycarbonate resin b cannot be improved. If this ratio exceeds 40 60 and the amount of the resin a is too large, the impact strength of the polycarbonate resin b is drastically reduced. The suitable ratio of the resin a to the resin b is preferably from 10 90 to 30 70, more preferably 15 85 to 25 750 In blending these resins, a dry blend of the pellets of the two obtained without heat melting may be directly moled by an injection molding machine. In such an embodiment, too, the resin composition of this invention shows substantially equivalent properties to a resin composition obtained by heat melting as described above. If desired, before blending, an antioxidant, an antistatic agent, an ultraviolet absorber, a coloring agent, an inorganic filler, a plasticizer, etc. may be added. The resulting resin composition has a glass transition temperature at least 200 higher than the rubber modified styrene maleic anhydride copolymer resin a as its component, and as stated hereinabove, has far better moldability and impact strength.
