# DEVICE FOR A MOTORIZED SAW DEVICE FOR A MOTORIZED SAW

## Abstract
A device for a motorized saw wherein the saw guide bar consists of a reciprocating toothed saw blade 13 and a relative to this stationary support plate 12 . One circular disc 14 is loosely laid into an elongated recess 15 in the support plate 12 such that it is movable relative to the support plate 12 as well as to the saw blade 13 and therefore the friction against the support plate is diminished.
