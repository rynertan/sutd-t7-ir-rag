# Device for the controlled insulin or glucose infusion in diabetic subjects.

## Abstract
A device is described consisting of an implantable semipermeable hollow fiber circuit 1 , through which a saline solution 3 is pumped 2 , a sensor 4 for the glucose assay on the said solution and a microcomputer unit 6 which controls an insulin 7 and a glucose 8 infusion pump on the basis of glucose concentration measurements. The hollow fibers form a filter into which low molecular weight molecules may diffuse until the equilibrium is reached with their concentration in the surrounding body fluid.
