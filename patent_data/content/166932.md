# Protective circuit arrangement.

## Abstract
A protective circuit arrangement is described for protect ing semiconductor components connected to input and output terminals 10 against overvoltages in bipolar inte grated circuits. The circuit arrangement contains at least one supply voltage terminal 12 and a ground terminal 14 . Between the ground terminal 14 and at least the input and output terminals 10 which are connected to components sensitive to overvoltage a thyristor tetrode 22 having a first control electrode 28 and a second control electrode 30 is inserted, the first control electrode 28 being connected to a line 18 which in the operative state of the integrated circuit lies at a voltage above the ground potential and the second control electrode 30 being connected to the ground termin al 14.
