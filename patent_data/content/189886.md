# Improved process for preparing sucrose encrusted methylcellulose particles for use in bulk laxative compositions.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to an improved process for preparing sucrose encrusted methylcellulose particles which readily disperse in cold aqueous liquids. These encrusted particles are suitable for use in bulk laxative compositions. In the improved process, hot sucrose syrup is mixed with powdered methylcellulose, dried and milled.
