## Description
BURS ER 1TH tZ Al R EGRATOR This invention relates to a burner having a regulator for the air supply. In any burner the air for combustion is regulated by a damper, butterfly valve, one or more gates etc, and this causes a loss of head in the air circuit. Also the air is set in motion either by the natural draught, by a fan or more usually by a combination of the two. Apart from certain highly automated industrial installations, the adjustment is fixed and is set at intervals which may range from for example one week to one year. The adjustment is made for average conditions and therefore is rarely satisfactory if the natural draught of the chimney represents a substantial part of the total motive head. A burner having an air regulator which automatically controls the air pressure at the inlet of the burner at a fixed value which may be that of the combustion chamber or at a value differing from that of the combustion chamber by a fixed amount is disclosed and claimed in ourFrench patent application 8022360. This invention concerns a modification of that invention and comprises a burner having an air regulator through which air must flow before entering the air inlet to the burner wherein said regulator comprises a detector having a sensitive element which is subjected to the pressure of the air supply to the burner and which is subjected to the pressure of the air or gas flow dovmstream of the burner.A change in pressure in the combustion chamber of the burner causes a change in the equilibrium position of the sensitive element. There is a stepping motor connected to the regulator whereby movement of said motor causes a change in the amount of.air flowing through the regulator. There are means for actuating the stepping motor in response to a change in the equilibrium position of the sensitive element or a change in the equilibrium position of the sensitive element above a predetermined level. By this means whilst the burner is operating the pressure difference which may be zero between the air supply to the burner and the air or gas flow downstream of the burner remains substantially constant. Ihe air regulator is eminently suitable for use with the burner described in french patent specification 75 15854 equivalent to UK patent application 20532 76 . However the air regulator can be attached to any burner, for example burners used for heating premises connected to natural draught chimneys. Furthermore the air regulator can act as a scavenging limiter. hen the burner issnot being used, for as the pressure drops in the combustion zone and chimney of the burner so will the supply of air to the regulator from the atmosphere substantially cease. It has been found that there is good control on burners fitted with this regulator with a diminution in the variation in the amount of C02 produced compared vith the same burner not using this regulator. The sensitive element of the detector is preferably a diaphragm, but it cou3d for example, be a bellows. For a simple diaphragm it is only necessary to ascertain whether it is deformed in one direction or another it is not necessary to measure the deformation. Conseouently the mechanical characteristics of the diaphragm are unimportant and its asseinbly does not necessitate great rigidity or precision machining. The diaphragm can for example be made of myEar polyester film and be clamped between two spacing frames. These frames are placed between two printed circuit plates which constitute part of the actuating means and which are perforated to let the pressure pass through. Depending on the direction of the pressure the diaphragm presses against one or other of the printed circuits and activates the stepping motor as explained later. Other forms of diaphragm are discs of flexible metal, e.g. brass.The diaphragm should be supported in a container so that one face of the diaphragm can be subjected to the pressure of the air supply to the burner and the other face can be subjected to the pressure of the air or gas flow downstream of the burner. The separate communications between the detector and the air or gas flow downstream of the burner and between the detector and the air supply to the burner are usually by way of pipe, conduit or tubing.The communication with the air or gas flow downstream of the burner is preferably made with the chimney stack of the boiler, but it can if desired be made at the combustion chamber itself. Most burners are provided with a fan or other device which takes in air at atmospheric pressure and delivers it at a higher pressure e.g. a compressor. In such cases the relevant part of the sensitive element, e.g. one face of the diaphragm, must be subjected to the pressure of the air supply upstream of the fan or said other device.Most burners also have an adjustment means whereby for a given operation the amount of air entering the burner is fixed at a certain level.Again the respective face of the diaphragm or relevant part of the sensitive element must communicate with the pressure of the air supply upstream of the adjustment means and the fan. Tie mc lns for actuating e stel inI rotor can take various iorins. Thus, as previously mentioned when the sensitive element is a diaphragm the actuating means can be a pair of printed circuits, one located near one face of the diaphragm and the other located near the other face of the diaphragm so that when the diaphragm deforms it contacts either one printed circuit or the other printed circuit depending on which face of the diaphragm is pressurised. Alternatively, there may be optoelectronic means, for instance a photodiode, so that a light signal e.g. from a light emitting diode, is only received when the diagraphm which is preferably a reflective metallised membrane is deformed in one direction.As.another alternative if the diaphragm is made of conductive material or is coated with a conductive film, deformation of the diaphragm in one direction causes electrical contact. There IS preferably a single, bi directinal, stepping motor, movement of which changes the amount of air entering the regulator from the atmosphere. The stepping motor is usually controlled by a simple electronic control card comprising a simple ring wired shift register. The control clock signal can be obtained by for example half wave rectification of a 50 Hz main, the square signal being obtained by clipping. Ken the direction of the shift of the register is reversed e.g. by the diaphragm contacting the opposite printed circuit, then the stepping motor rotates in the opposite direction and this causes a change in the amount of air entering the regulator from the atmosphere. If air has been entering the regulator freely then a reversal of the stepping motor causes the supply of air to cease, but on the contrary if air has been unable to enter the regulator then the reversal of direction of the stepping motor causes air to enter the regulator. Although the above described system operates satisfact n, J sometimes it can be unstable around the point of zero pressure. Thus, the motor advances a few steps, the regulator closes slightly, the pressure differential upon the detector is reversed, the latter deflects, the motor recedes a few steps, the regulator opens slightly, the detector reverses again, etc. In this system there can be no resonance, the motor always advances or recedes at the speed imposed by the clock signal and always receives control impulses of constant intensity. This system however can be stabilised by creating a neutral zone.To achieve this two detectors of slightly different sensitivities are used and their control signals received in an appropriate manner. when both detectors are deflected in the same direction the stepping motor advances or recedes , but when only one pick up, the more sensitive, is deflected the shift of the register is stopped and this stops the motor. The advantage of having two detectors of different sensitivity is that there is no change in the air supply when the pressure of the air or gas flow downstream of the burner changes over a relatively narrow pressure band, e.g. 1 Pa. Change in the air supply only occurs when the pressure of the air or gas flow downstream of the burner changes outside this relatively narrow pressure band. For the system to function appropriately it is necessary for the detectors to have a definite position, e.g. left or right, at least the less sensitive of the two. This is achieved automatically when the sensitive element, e.g. diaphragm activates a microswitch because the latter has only two positions. Alternatively the diaphragm can be locked on the right or on the left for example, by placing two small magnets on the armatures, on each side of the diaphragm, the latter carrying a soft iron washer in its centre. As another alternative when a mctal iscd mylar diaphragm is used it is attracted to one ol other armature by electrostatic attraction.In all cases the diaphragm will be very flexible and it is the force of the spring of the microswitch or the force of magnetic or electrostatic attraction which defines the sensitivity of the system. The latter case is advantageous in that the sensitivity.of the diaphragm can be regulated electrically. The system using magnets can be regulated by varying the distance of the magnets from the diaphragm. With a microswitch the sensitivity of the system is fixed. The connection between the detector and the regulating means can be adjusted so that negative pressure in the combustion chamber will tend to move the detector in a direction closing the regulating means. If the burner is operating this closure will subject the air supply to a subatmospheric pressure and with no return force the reguiating means will continue to close until the air supply pressure is equal to the pressurs in the combustion chamber. If the burner is not working the flow of air is very slight so that the pressure dropthrough the regulator is negligible and the regulator will close completely, thus limiting the scavenging of the combustion chamber when the burner is not working. This may often be. advantageous in that heat losses can be reduced during shut down periods. The advantage of the system of this invention lies in the fact that there is ease of integration due to the small volume of the motor and its large torque enabling registers of widely different designs to be actuated. There is also greater tolerance to dirt due to the strong torque of the motor. The invention is now described with reference to the drawings in which Figure .1 shows a perspective view of one form of regulator suitable for use with .the burner in accordance with the invention Figure 2 shows a cross section of the diaphragm of the regulator shown in Fig 1 contacting a printed circuit plate Figures 3 to 5 show elevations of portions of alternative forms of regulators to that shown in Figure land Fig 6 shows a stepping motor controlling the air supply to the burner and being itself controlled by signals from a pair of diaphragms. Referring to Figure 1 of the drawings where it is assumed that the combustion chamber is under negative pressure a damper 1 closes an air box 2 in communication with the air supply. This damper 1 is constructed so as to slide freely so that the difference in pressure between the two faces of the damper does not lead to any forces tending to open or close the damper. A diaphragm 3 is suspended ln a chamber 4 between two spacing frames 5 and 6 and is free to contact alternately according to the pressure exerted on it perforated printed circuit plates 7 and 8. The zones 12 and 11 on each side of the diaphragm 3 are connected respectively via conduits 9 and 10 to the box 2 and the combustion chamber not shown . Fig 2 shows more clearly the diaphragm 3 pressed against one of the printed circuit plates 7. Tlovement of the damper 1 is controlled by movement of the stepping motor not shown . The motor is itself controlled by its control system which is an electronic control card comprising a simple ring wired shift register.The direction of the shift of the register is reversed every time the diaphragm 3 contacts. the opposite printed circuit7 or F g 3 slows an alternj tivc detection s stenx to that shown Fig. 2. .U Supported from the printed circuit plate 71 are a light emitting diode 20 and a photodiode 21. The membrane which in this case is a reflective metallised membrane is shown in two positions at 31a and 31, and it can be seen from the light rays that the photodiode 21 only receives rays from the diode when the membrane is in the position shown at 31a. Fig 4 shows an alternative system where the diaphragm 32 is stabilised by being yocked by the .presence of a magnet 22. The diaphragm 32 has a soft iron washer 23 at its centre. The printed circuit 72 has contacts 40 and 41. Fig 5 shows another alternative diaphragm stabilised system wherein a double faced metallised molar diaphragm 33 is used. This is attracted to two double faced printed circuits 73 and 74, each at a potential of 300V, the potential of the diaphragm 33 being maintained at 100V. In fact the potentials are adjustable according to the dimensions, contacts, dielectric properties, etc. Fig 6 shows one form of regulating means by which the damper 1 in Fig 1 for example is controlled. In Fig 6 there is an air fan 50 controlled by a stepping motor 51 which in turn is controlled by a ring wired shift register 52. This register 52 receives its signal as the result of the deflections of the two diaphragms 80 and 81, one of which is more sensitive than the other. It is only when both diaphragms 80 and 81 are deflected in the same direction that the stepping motor 51 advances or recedes . Conduit 82 enables the diaphragms 80 and 81 to be subjected to the pressure of the air or gas low downstream of the burner not shown and conduit 83 enables the diaphragms 80 and 81 to be subjected to the pressure of the air supply to the burner.
