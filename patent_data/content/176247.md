# Corrosion protected, multi layer fuel cell interface.

## Abstract
An improved interface 60 configuration for use be tween adjacent elements of a fuel cell stack 10 . The interface 60 is impervious to gas and liquid and provides resistance to corrosion by the electrolyte 33 of the fuel cell. The multi layer configuration for the interface 60 comprises a non cupreous metal coated metallic element to which is film bonded a conductive layer 52 by hot pressing a resin 54 therebetween. The multi layer arrangement provides bridging electrical contact.
