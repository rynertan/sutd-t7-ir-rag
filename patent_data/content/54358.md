# Method for decomposing hydrogen peroxide and application to the determination of an analyte.

## Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide is decomposed completely by reac tion with a phenol or substituted phenol, or an aniline or substituted aniline in the presence of a peroxidase. The method is particularly applied to quantative determination of an analyte e.g. cholesterol ester, using enzymatic oxidation and colorimetric determination of the hydrogen peroxide produced in a sample containing both the analyte and an oxidisable derivative thereof. Also disclosed are composi tions for the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide compris ing the phenol or aniline component and a peroxidase, and optionally an oxidase.
