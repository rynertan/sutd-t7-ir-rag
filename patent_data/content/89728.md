# Encoding circuit for a SECAM colour television transmission.

## Abstract
An encoding circuit for a SECAM colour television transmission, comprising a frequency modulatable oscillator for a modulating signal which comprises two line sequential colour difference signals, the circuit also comprising a control loop for making the quiescent frequencies in the generated frequency modulated signal substantially equal to reference frequencies. For this purpose the control loop comprises a multiplexer, a frequency demodulator and two control paths each having two sample and hold circuits. The sequence of the signals conveyed by the multiplexer and the time position of the measuring intervals are chosen such that at least a line scan period is located between the quiescent frequency measuring interval and the reference frequency measuring interval.
