# CONTROL SYSTEM FOR HUMIDITY CONTROLLER OF TOBACCO LEAVES

## Abstract
A system for controlling the water content and tempera ture of tobacco leaves in a humidity controller is provided. Said system comprises means for measuring the water content 102 , temperature 104 and flow rate 106 of the tobacco leaves conveyed to the humidity controller 3 which provides the tobacco leaves with the water content and temperature necessary for rib removal to maintain the quality of the tobacco leaves operation means 110 for calculating the amount of water and steam to be added upon the basic of the measurements of said measuring means and the preset values representative of the water content and temperature provided to the tobacco leaves and for compen sating 200, 201, 203, 204 for the deviation between the spraying position of water and steam and the position of measuring the water content and the temperature of the tobacco leaves which have been provided with water and steam and the time lag of rise up and fall of the water content and temperature when the preset values are changed and control means for controlling means for supplying the water and steam in response to the values calculated by the operation means and for correcting the deviation between the measurements of the water content and temperature of the tobacco leaves provided with water content and steam and the preset values.
