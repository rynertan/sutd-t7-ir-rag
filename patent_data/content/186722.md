# Process for the manufacture of hypochlorous acid.

## Abstract
A process and apparatus for the manufacture of chloride free hypochlorous acid by hydrolyzing of chlorine with steam, solid gas stripping of the co generated hydro chloric acid vapor in a fluidized bed reactor, equilibrium discharge of chloride particulate from the bed of the reactor, selective dissolving of the hypochlorous acid vapor into aqueous product solution in a packed bed absorber, and closed loop recycling of the stripped product stream.
