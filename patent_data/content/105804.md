# Human monoclonal antibodies against bacterial toxins.

## Abstract
The production of stable hybrid cell lines that secrete human monoclonal antibodies against bacterial toxins by fusing post immunization human peripheral blood lympho cytes with nonsecretor mouse myeloma cells is described. Using the method, protective monoclonal antibodies against tetanus toxin and diphtheria toxin were produced that bind tetanus toxin and diphtheria toxin in vitro, respectively, and prevent tetanus and diphtheria in vivo in animals, respec tively.
