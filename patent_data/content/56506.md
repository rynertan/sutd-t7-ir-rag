## Description
Stahilizing Tool for earth boring drill strings together with actuator assembly tilerefor and tnethod of usitne This invention relates to a directional drilling tool utilizing a drill string in,a borehole and more particularly to such a tool having an actuawor assembly and a method for using same, wherein borehole deviation with respect to the vertical can be controlled to increase, decrease, or maintain the angle of such deviation without removal of the drill string from the borehole. The technology developed with respect to drilling boreholes in the earth has long encompassed the use of various techniques and tools t control the deviation of boreholes during the drilling operation.In some instances, such technology is employed to retard borehole deviation. In other instances, increased directional deviation is desired. However, in almost all instances it has heretofore been necessary to withdraw the dill string assembly from the borehole for the attachment of various specialized tools to achieve the desired objective. The prior art represented by such patents as U.S. Patent Nos. 2,891,769 3,092,188 3,593,810 2,686,660 and 3,424,256 evidence such operational limitations. Additional prior art includesUS Patent Nos. 3,123,162 3,145,785 and 3,894,590. Drilling operations, particularly in petroleum exploration, are commonly carried out at great depths frequently reaching several thousands of feet below the earth s surface. Since a drill string is composed of a multiplicity of sections of drill pipe which must successively be disassembled upon removal from the borehole, the removal of the drill string from the borehole for the attachment of directional tools at the remote end of the drill string is an extremely timeconsuming and thus expensive operation. Such procedures often entail several days of work. This down time t is extremely expensive and a significant factor in the determination of the economic feasibility of exploratory drilling.The problem becomes chronic where, as is frequently the case, it is necessary to change the angle of borehole deviation several times requiring considerable down time in each instance. In United States Patent 3,974,886 a directional drilling tool is disclosed for accomplishing many of the aforementioned goals. However, while the directional drilling tool of the 886 patent does allow for remote actuation thereof, such is not capable of multiple repeated usages wherein the stabilizing pads are moved from radially inwardly to radially outwardly positions or intermediate positions, in ny order, multiple times without requiring down time in removing the entire string because of the necessity of replacing shear pins and barrier rings associated with the movement of the stabilization pads thereof between the radially outwardly and radially inwardly positions.Specifically, the Q86 reference does not permit movement of the st lization pads to their respective outermost radial position and then at some later point usage thereof at t an intermediate radial position without removal of the stabilization tool to replace such shear ring corresponding with the intermediate position, hence resulting in increased down time . Therefore, it has long been recognized that it would be desirable to have a dire tional drilling tool adapted for incorporation in a drill string individually or Xn any desired combination and capable of remaining inactive so as not to impede the normal drilling operations, but subject to being activated any number of times to any extent desired without requiring removal of the drill string from the borehole and which subsequently can be deactivated, reactivated, cr reused without requiring removal thereof from the borehole. The present invention seeks to provide a downhole stabilizing tool for directional drilling, with an actuator assembly therefor, and a method for using same to provide an improved directional drilling tool for drilling in the earth.

More particularly the spacer means 72 includes an upper end 72 adapted to be received within the bore 70b of stop body member 70. The upper end 70a is formed having a pointed end 72b and conic tapered surface 72c adjacent outer annular surface 72d cf the upper end 72a of the spacer means 72. A suitable detent 72e is formed in the outer annular surface 72d with radial lips 72f, 72g formed adjacent thereto, and an annular surface 72h is formed adjacent radial lip 72g.Preferably, the dia meter of the annular surface 72h is such that the annular surface 72h of spacer means 72 is adapted to be disposed within tool housing bore tOc of upper housing 10 and with appropriate seal means 80 disposed between the tool housing bore lOc adjacent radial lip 72g for ensuring a fluid tight relation between the spacer means 72 and upper housing 10 of the tool housing T as desired. The seal means 80 may include any type of suitable seal 80a to ensure the fluid tight relation therebetween. Resilient upper stop means designated generally as 82 is used for biasing the stop body member 70 in the first position with the upper stop means 78 being retracted. The resilient upper stop means 82 includes a suitable spring 82a adapted to be mounted adjacent and with radial lip 72f adjacent surface 72d and extending thereto detent 70e formed with the stop body member 70. The stop tab 70h of the stop plug 70g is adapted to be received within the detent 72e formed in the spacer means 72. Relative reciprocal movement between the stop body member 70 and spacer means 72 is limited to the extent of the detent 72e and the travel of the stop tab 70h therein, with the resilient upper stop means 82 biasing the stop body member 70 in the first position wherein the upper stop means 78 is retracted. The spacer means 72 further includes a lower end 72i which has threads 72j formed adjacent thereto and radial lip 72k adjacent threads 72j. The threads 725 of spacer means 72 are adapted to threadedly engage threads 74a formed with the upper portion 74b of the piston body member 74. The piston body member 74 includes a cylindrical sleeve 74c having a bore 74d formed therein. The sleeve 74c includes end surfaces 74e, 74f, and outer annular surface 74g. Preferably, a plurality of circumferentially disposed radially extending lower stop slots 74h are formed with the sleeve 74c as are a plurality of circumferentially disposed radially extending first latch slots 74i, second latch slots 74j, and third latch slots 74k.As best seen in Figure 6, preferably slots 74h, 74j, 74k are formed as first latch slot 74i and preferably include four of such slots circumferentially disposed equidistance about the piston body member 74. Adjacent the lower portion 741 sultatie threads 74m are formed for receiving pawl resiliency mea designated generally as 76 discussed more fully hereinbelow The sleeve 74c further includes suitable detent not numbered for receiving a snap ring 74n therein. The lower stop means designated generally as 85 and the latch means designated generally as 88 are mounted with the piston body member 74. The lower stop means 85 includes lower stop 86 that is pivotally mounted with the piston body member 74 by pin 46p to allow movement thereof between an initial position wherein the lower stop means 86 is in a radially inwardly position as shown in Figure 3 and a final position wherein the lower stop means 86 is in a radially outwardly position as shown in gure 9. The lower stop 86 includes surfaces 86a, 86b, 86c which are preferably parallel with one another and inner and outer surfaces 86d, 86e, respectively.Similarly, latch means 88 is mounted with the piston body member 74 by means of pin 74r to allow pivotal movement of the latch means 88 from a primary position wherein the latch means 88 is in a contracted, radially inwardly position es shown in Figure 9. Preferably, the latch means 88 includes latch dog 90 having surfaces 90e, 90b, 90c, 90d, 90e. Latch dogs such as latch dog 90 are adapted to be disposed within either the first latch slots 74i, second latch slots 74j, or third latch slots 74k of the piston body member 74 merely be repositioning of pin 74r within the openings 74s in second latch slot 74j and latch means 88 or opening 74t in third latch slots 74k and latch means 88. A piston assembly 92 is adapted to be disposed within the piston body member 74. The piston assembly 92 includes a lower stop engaging surface 92fi, first latch dog engaging surface 92b, second latch dog engaging surface 92c, and third latch dog engaging surface 92g is formed adjacent engaging surface 92d. A spring portion 92h is formed above recess 92e and is adapted to receive bias means 94 which includes spring 94a with the piston body member for biasing the piston assembly 92 for movement from a lower position wherein the piston assembly is in the position shown in Figure 3 to an upper position wherein the piston assembly 92 is in the position illustrated in Figure 9.The bias means 94 is adapted to be positioned between the snap ring 74n of t e piston body member 74 and the spring portion 92h of the piston assembly 92 with a constant upward urging upon the piston assembly 92 by the spring 94a. As such, the piston assembly 92 is adapted to move reciprocally within the bore 74d of the piston body member 74. The pawl resiliency means 76 is adapted to be mounted aith the lower portion 741 of the piston body member 74. The pawl resiliency means 76 includes mounting member 76a which includes threads 76b which are adapted to engage. compatibly formed threads 74m of the piston body member 74 for attachment therewith. The mounting member 76a has a central portion 76c which is adapted to abut end surface 74e when in threaded engagement ith the piston body member 74. A threaded shaft 76d preferably extends downwardly from the central portion 76c and is adapted to receive resilient material portion 76e thereabout having a securing cap 76f adjacent the lower portion thereof and in threaded engagement with the threaded shaft 76d. Prefeiably, the resilient.material portion 76e may be of any suitable resilient material such as polyurethane or the like as discussed more fully hereinbelow while the securing cap 76f is preferably of an appropriate high strength material. Unthreading of the securing cap 76f allows removal of the resilient material portion 76e from the threaded shaft 76d of the pawl resiliency means 76. Lower stop resiliency means designated generally shs 96 is formed with the upper portion 74b of the piston body member 74 and includes a pin 96a adapted to be movably mounted within a suitable opening 74u formed in piston body member 74, a spring 96b mounted in the opening 74n, and a threaded plug 96c adapted to be threaded into a portion of the opening 74u such that the spring 96b acts against plug 96c to force pin 96a down wardly into engagement with the lower stop means 85. In the use or operation of the downhole stabilizing tool T and actuator assembly A described above, the tool housing H necessarily must be affixed with the drill string D. However, prior to such affixation, the stabilizing tool T must be preprogrammed. As noted hereinabove, the actuator assembly A includes programming means G for cooperatively engaging surfaces formed with the stabilizing tool T that are a spaced apart programmed distance for moving the stabilization pad means P between contracted and expanded lateral positions. Preprogramwing of the stabilizing tool T is accomplished by establishing a specific distance between end surface 18b and actuator detent 18d of the sleeve member 18.This distance must correspond between the distance between the latch dog 90 and surface 86c of lower stop 86 which forms the programming means G as is discussed more fully hereinbelow. Thereafter, the stabilizing tool T is mounted with the fluid conductive drill string D and lowered into the borehole.Multiple downhole stabilizing tools T may be mounted with the drill string D as it is lowered into the borehole and may include up to three of such stabilizing tools T being used based upon the embodiments shown in the figures. However, appropriate modification of the stabilizine tool T and actuator assembly A may be made to accommodate a greater number of stabilizing tools T in one drill string D as may be necessary. As the drill string D is lowered into the borehole, typically drilling mud is forced through the central opening 14b of the drill pipe 14, through the bore of the downhole stabilizing tool T to the drill bit not shown for drilling operations. When it is desired to actuate the stabilizing tool T, the fluid pressure is removed from the drill string D. The actuator assembly A is preprogrammed with the programming means G to correspond with the predetermined distance such that the distance between surface 86c of the lower stop 86 and latch dog 90 correspond to that of the predetermined distance between end surface 18b and actuator detent 18d of sleeve member 18. As such, the actuator assembly A is then lowered into the drill string D by means of wire line 68.During the lowering operation, the upper stop resiliency means designated generally as 98 and including pin 70k, spring 701, and plug 70m act to keep the upper stop means 78 in a retracted position because of the urging of pin 70k upon a surface 78 c of the upper stop 78a, with the upper stop 78a pivoting about pin 73n to remain in a retracted position. Accordingly, the upper stop 78a will not catch or snag upon any surface or lip during lowering of the wireline 68, Siml larly, the lower stop means 85 is maintained in the initial position shown in Figure 2B by means of lower stop resiliency means 96. The lower stop resiliency means 96 urges the lower stop means 85 into the initial position by the pin 96a acting upon surface 86a with the lower stop 86 pivoting about pin 74 to a radially inward position.Accordingly, the lower stop means 85 will similarly not snag or catch upon any lateral surfaces.On the other hand, latch means 88 which includes latch dog 90 is free to move between its primary and secondary positions based upon any contact that it may have with any surface or edge during its travels while the actuator assembly A is being lowered on the wireline 68. As the actuaor assembly A is lowered, the edge 90e of the latch dog 90 between surfaces 90c, 90d is adapted to ride upon any inner surface encountered.As the inner surface expands, the latch dog 88 pivots outwardly in response to the upward urging of the bias means 94 upon piston assembly 92 such that the piston assembly 92 tends to force the latch dog 90 outwardly.As the latch dog 90 moves outwardly, the piston assembly may move reciprocally within the sleeve assembly S such that the lower stop engaging surface 92a comes in contact with surface 86b of the lower stop 86 and forces the lower stop 86 outwrdly against the action of the lower stop resiliency means 96. However, for any movement of the lower stop 86 to occur, such must be positioned in the area where the lower stop 86 may radially expand.For example, if the latch dog 90 had just been lowered below end surface lOi Figures 3, 9 with the latch dog 90 expanding radially outwardly, the piston assembly 92 would be urged upwardly by the bias means 94 resulting in action of lower stop engaging surface 92a against surface 86b of the lower stop 86. However, the surface 86e of the lower stop 86 would engage the bore lOc of the upper housing 10 and consequently would be unable to radially expand. The latch dog 90 is configured in such a fashin so that it is easily received in and out from any surface and or detent which is accomplished by tapered surfaces 90c, 90d, 90e which guide the latch dog 90 in and out of patential hindrances as may be encountered during lowering of the actuator assembly A. When the larch dog 90 engages the actuator detent 18d of the sleeve member 18, as before, the latch dog 90 may move radially outwardly from the primary position to its secondary position shown in Figure 9, in response to urging of the bias means 94 on piston assembly 92. As a consequence, the surface 90a of the latch dog 90 engages first latch dog engaging surface 92b of the piston assembly 92 while at the same time, lower stop engaging surface 92a comes in full face contact with sur face 86b of the lower stop 86, forcing the lower stop means 85 radially outwardly from its initial position Figure 3 to the final position shown in Figure 9, against the action of the lower stop resiliency means 96, As a consequence, surface 86a of the lower stop 6 86 contacts and abuts the upper surface of slot 74h allowing surface 86c of the lower stop 86 to come into full face engagement with end surface 18b of sleeve member 18. When the actuator assembly A is lowered into this position, the seal means 80 comes into engagement with the bore lOc of upper housing 10. With the lower stop means 85 in engagement with end surface lSb of the sleeve member 18, resistance to additional lowering thereof is encountered at the surface of the well. Thereafter, the fluid pressure is reexerted upon the drill string D and the stabilizing tool r and actuator assembly A. As a result of the sealable relation between the spacer means 72 and upper housing 10 by seal means 80, pressure begins to act upon the combination of the wireline connector 66 and stop body member 70. As pressure increases, the stop body nlember 70 is forced downwardly prom its first position wherein the upper stop means 78 is in a retracted Figure 2 position to a second position where the upper stop means 78 is in the expanded position Figure 8 . As the pressure continues to increase, the stop body member 70 is forced downwardly with respect to the upper end 72a of the spacer means 7 until the upper stop 78a engages first the point 72b then surface 72c of the spacer means 72 resulting in outward movement thereof, against the action of the upper stop resiliency means 98.Thus, the upper stop neans 78 moves from the position shown in solid lines in Figure 2 to that of the dotted lines as the stop body member 70 moves downwardly in response to increased fluid pressure. It should be noted that the increased fluid pressure allows overcoming of the spring 82a of the resilient upper stop means 82 with the stop tab 70h limiting the extent to which the stop body member 70 may be moved downwardly, as does lower end surface 70d when such engages the seal 80a for compression thereof to ensure a fluid tight relation therebetween the spacer means 72 and upper housing 10 of the tool housing H Further, increased fluid pressure results in action of the lower stop means 85 against the sleeve assembly S such that the sleeve assembly S is forced downwardly against action of the resilient sleeve means 38.The forcing downwardly of the sleeve member 18 results in downward movement of the canning means 28 with respect to the stabilization pad means P. Such downward movement of the camming surface 181, 18m with respect to the similarly formed cam surfaces 50b, 50c of the pressure plates 50, result in radially outward expansion of the stabilization pad means P. As the sleeve member 18 is forced downwardly in response to fluid pressure, the pawl. engaging means engages the pawl means M such that as the tapered surface 40a of the spring dog 40 loses contact with surface 34d of the pawl member 34 and the spring dog 40 is urged radially inwardly by resilient member 46.However, such radial inward movement is limited by the spring dog 40 contacting the resilient material 76e of the pawl resiliency means 76,As the tapered surface 40b engages tapered surface 34f, the spring dog 40 is forced radially inwardly ns into the resilient material 76e such that edge 40c clears the point of pawl 34r and is positioned adjacent surface 34h, Thus,, the resilient material 76e is of sufficient resiliency to prevent radially inward movement of the spring dog 40 because of its resilient nature yet will flex a fiÃ§ieng amount tc allow the tip 40c of the spring dog 40 to clear the corresponding tip of the pawls such as pawl 34r as the sleeve member 18 moves dovnwardly. As such, the spring dog 40 pivots about pin 42 with pin 44 lllpiting the maximum extent to which the spring dog 40 may move radially inwardly into the resilient material 76e.Sizing of the spacer means 72 permits selective engagement with pawls 34r, 34s, 34t, The upper stop means 78 engagement of surface 78e with annular lip lOd limits the extent to which the sleeve assembly S may move downwardly. Sccordingly, either the distance between surfaces 78e of the upper stop means 78 and 86c of the lower stop 86 and or the distance between annular lip lOd of the upper housing 10 and end surface 18b of the sleeve member is determinative of the extent to which tfie sleeve assembly S may move within the stabilizing tool T. As is illustrated in the drawings, this distance permits movement of the spring dog 40 beyond pawl 34r into engagement with pawl 34s but prevents engagement with pawl 34t.If the distance between the upper stop means 78 and lower stop means 85 were greater, then the spring dog 40 could move lower into engagement with pawl 34t, however, such is not the case. As the spring dog 40 clears pawls 34r, 34s, each time the spring dog 40 is forced into the resilient material 76e which springs the spring dog 40 radially outwardly after the point of the pawl is passed against the action of the resilient member 46.Positioning the sing dog 40 adjacent respective pawls 34r, 34s, 34t correspondingly relates to specific radial, lateral positions of the stabiliza n pad means P with respect to the tool housin When the spring dog 40 is positioned adjacent the proper pawl, such as pawl 34s in Figure 10, the fluid pressure is released, causing the stop body member 70 to move upwardly in response to the upward urging of the resilient upper stop means 82, which in turn prevents engagement of the upper stop 78a with the surfaces 72c and point 72 b, of the spacer means 72, causing retraction of the upper stop means 78 from its radially expanded position to the radially inwardly position.The upper stop resiliency means 98 ensures that the upper stop means 78 is fully retracted. Furthermore, upward movement of the stop body member 70 is sufficient to allow clearance of the annular lip lOd by the surface 78e of the upper stop means 78 once pressure on the drill stringD has been removed. At this point, the wireline 68 is retracted thus resulting in upward movement of the actuator assembly A.Such upward movement results in action between tapered surface 18f adjacent actuator detent 18d in sleeve member 18 with surface 90c of the latch dog 90, causing pivotal rotation about pin 74r with surface 90a no longer in full face contact with first latch dog engaging surface 92b with such action forcing the piston assembly 92 downwardly against action of the bias means 94 resulting in a lack of full face engagement between surface 86b of lower stop means 85 and lower stop engaging surface 92a of piston assembly 92, thus allowing the lower stop resiliency means 96 to act upon the lower stop means 85 for moving the same from the final position back to its initial position. In any areas where no constraining bore force either the latch dog 90 or lower stop means 85 into their primary and initial positions, respectively, such as in trite area between end surface lOi of upper housing 10 and above spring cap 20, surface 86e would contact the end surface lOi thus forcing the lower stop means 85 inwardly to move the piston assembly 92 downwardly allowing radially inward movement of the lower stop means 85. As such, the actuator assembly A may be retracted from the borehole with the stabilizing tool T being used as necessary, Should it be desired tglat the stabilization pad means P be retracted to its initial position, the actuator assembly A is again affixed to the wireline 68 for lowering in the drill string D.However, prior to such action, the resilient material 76e is removed from the pawl resiliency means 76, however, leaving the pos ironing of the lower stop 86 and latch dog 90 of the programming means G and upper stop means 78 as before.As with above the latch dog 90 and lower stop means 85 of the programming means G appropriately engage the actuator detent 18d and end surface 18b of the sleeve member 18 with consequent expansion of the upper stop means 78a in response to fluid pressure imposed on the drill string D at the surface. In this position, the upper stop means 78 is almost in engagement with annular lip lOd when fully pressurized.However, full pressurination results in a slight downward movement of the sleeve assembly 5 to move the spring dog 40 to a position as shown in Figure 10 such that the point 40c is beyond the tip of pawl 4s. As such, the spring dog 40 moves r.adi..a.lly inwardly in response to resilient member 46 in a,s.much as there is no resilient material 76e to impede such motion. The radially inward movement of the spring dog, 4Q is sufficient to allow clearance of the tip 40c with that of the pawl 34s and pawl 34r.However, it should be noted that the interior surface 34c adjacent pawl 34q is of a smaller inside diameter than the corres pong pawls 34r, 34s, 34t such that the tip 40c will engage, surface 34d as the actuator assembly A is drawn upwardly. Of course, such upward movement is not accomplished until the fluid pressure on the drill stringD is removed at the surface allowing the resilient sleeve means 30a to snap the sleeve assembly S upwardly until the point 40c engages surface 34d of pawl 34q for retracting the stabilization pad means P to their laterally innermost positions.Thus, the downhole stabilizing tool T may be used multiple times between positions wherein the sta ilization pad means P are fully expanded outwardly and fully retracted inwardly or intermediate thereof as the circumstances during the drilling operations may require. No removal of the downhole stabilizing tool T is necessary to accomplish these multiple position operations. Ali that is required is that the spacing between the upper stop means 78 and lower stop means 85 to be such that the desired amount of movement laterally of the stabilization pad means P be accomplished. As noted hereinabove, the downhole stablizing tool T may be used with multiples of such tools T on one drill string D. In such an instance, it is desirable that any one of such series of tools may be selectively actuated as is needed. Such is accomplished by preprogramming of the actuator assembly A with the predetermined distance between the end surface 18b and actuate detent 18d corresponding to a similar such distance between the lower stop means 85 and the latch means 88. As is shown in Figure 3, the latch dog 90 in addition to being mounted in slots 74i, could also be mounted in either slots 74j or slots 74k. Mounting the latch means 88 in slots 74j would result in a distance between the lower stop means 85 and latch means 88 greater than that if the latch means 88 were mounted in slots 74k.If, for example, the latch means 88 of Figure 3 were mounted in slot 74j, no actuation of the downhole stabilizing tool T would occur for the distance would not be such that the latch means 88 could move into the actuator detent 18d while the lower stop means 85 engages the end surface 18b of sleeve member 18. Thus, by programming the distance between the lower stop means 85 and latch means 88, one of a series of downhole stabilizing toolsT may be selectively engaged as is necessary. As before, by selecting the amount of vertical travel that the upper stop means 78 moves in response to fluid pressure until engagement with the annular lip lOd, the amount of corresponding vertical movement of the spring dog 40 is controlled, thus regulating the extent of lateral expansion of the stabilizing pad means P. Thus, it is possible that multiple stabilizing tools T may be used, with all having varying settings of the stabilizing pad means P as is necessary, with each of said series of stabilizing tools T adaptable to being retracted to positions wherein the stabilizing pad means P are at their innermost positions or at their outermost positions or any intermediate position based upon needs as they are encountered. Thus, the downhole stabilizing tool T ana ssctuator assembly A described above provide a new and improved directioral drilling tool and method for using same wherein once the doamhole stabilizing tool T is mounted with the trill string D, such need not be removed during such drilling operations until complete, therefore eliminating significant dowm time for increased cost savings.
