## Description
In its various aspects this invention relates to the production of phenylalanine by a biosynthetic pathway. A fundamental limitation of Bernard et al., 1979 Gene Franklin, 1971 pp. 621 638, Stryer, Tribe, Australian Application 72727 81, discloses a strain of Sninsky et al., U.S. Patent 4,374,927, discloses fusing the Chemical Abstracts 1982 Vol .

USA We describe below use of an expression vector to transform cells to produce a desired compound by a biosynthetic pathway, which vector includes at least two structural genes that are a synthetic operon, meaning that, on the vector construction, they are expressed under the control of a single regulatory sequence and promoter, whereas in naturally occurring constructions, genes corresponding to the operon genes are expressed under the control of distinct separate regulatory sequences. The operon genes code respectively for enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway, and at least one of those genes is feedback derepressed. The natural gene corresponding to at least one of the operon genes is feedback repressed. By feedback repressed , we mean that expression of the natural gene is subject to repression by a control substance that is a pathway intermediate or product. The corresponding operon gene is derepressed , meaning that the vector promoter is foreign to the repressed natural gene and expresses operon genes without repression from the pathway intermediate or product. By foreign we mean that the promoter does not naturally occur in position to initiate transcription of the corresponding natural gene. Thus, the vector enables uninhibited expression of the operon genes in the presence of all biosynthesis pathway intermediates as well as the pathway product. In the detailed description below, the desired compound is phenylalanine. According to a first aspect of this invention, we provide a host cell engineered to produce phenylalanine by a biosynthetic pathway said cell being characterised in comprising an expression vector including a synthetic construction comprising a The vector promoter is most preferably the In a second and alternative aspect, the invention provides a method of making phenylalanine by a biosynthetic pathway, characterised in comprising the steps of transforming a host cell with an expression vector including a synthetic construction comprising a Preferably, the Preferably, the cells are The invention enables production of phenylalanine by the above described engineers cells, which avoid normal synthesis inhibiting regulatory mechanisms, and therefore does not curtail synthesis in response to elevated levels of the product. In many applications, as the product builds up, it is released to the supernatant milieu, thus making recovery of the biochemical more convenient. The engineered vector is able to override natural regulatory modes, e.g., leader attenuator regulation and operator repressor regulation. Specifically, exogenous regulatory DNA can effectively control gene expression of gene products that are key enzymes in the pathway, and this finding his broad applicability to other promoters such as phage m13 gene II promoter and the These factors support a higher level of gene expression, and thereby increase the rate of the rate limiting step in the pathway, as well as the rate of other pathway steps catalyzed by operon gene products. Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments thereof. We first briefly describe the drawings. Figs. 1 4 are diagrams representing respectively steps in the engineering of plasmids pKB663, pKB712, pKB750, and pKB766. The desired product compound is synthesized by cells via a synthesis pathway with steps that are targets of gene expression regulation. That is, regulation at a step in the synthesis pathway is accomplished by varying the level of expression of the gene for an enzyme to vary the amount of enzyme in the cell, and such regulation involves DNA sequences adjacent to the regulated gene. Replacement of such regulatory DNA sequences with heterologous regulatory sequences, by recombinant DNA techniques, is used to circumvent the normal regulation of a biosynthetic pathway and augment the production of a biochemical beyond the point where normal regulation would have halted its further production. The pathway steps selected for derepression should be rate limiting ones so that successful derepression will show a gain in product yield. The dual mechanism repressed enzymes are the specific targets. In order to deactivate both of the repression mechanisms, it is preferable to remove the regulatory DNA that naturally occurs with the structural gene whose expression is being derepressed and to add a foreign promoter i.e. one that in naturally occurring structures does not govern expression of the gene . In the preferred embodiments comprising a synthetic operon, the promoter may be foreign to both of the genes, or it may be foreign only to the gene selected for derepression. The two synthetic operon genes should be close to each other, but there may be short, or even quite long, sequences between them, as long as there are no signals to stop transcription between the genes. Each synthetic operon gene corresponds to the structural component of a naturally occurring gene. By the term corresponds to we mean that the operon gene is either identical or sufficiently related to the naturally occurring structural gene that the operon gene codes for an enzyme that catalyzes the reaction catalyzed by the natural gene product. Choice of the other operon component offers an opportunity to engineer a construction that highly expresses another pathway enzyme. One preferred choice is another rate critical pathway step. The other operon component also may be selected to simplify the cloning procedure by selecting a gene with regulatory material that is used on the vector. In that case, the 3 end of the operon may be the derepressed structural gene, and the 5 end may be the other member of the operon with its naturally occurring regulatory sequence. If a promoter is used that is exogenous or foreign to both members of the operon, the members can be linked in either order. Additional structural genes may be added to the operon, and more than one of them may be feedback repressed in its naturally occurring structure, so that it also is derepressed by insertion in the operon. The following three examples of preferred vectors pKB663, pKB712, and pKB750 are illustrative. Each vector is useful in synthesizing the amino acid L phenylalanine by derepressing expression of the The DNA for the The first component is the The second component is the The above two components are joined at their In the pKB712, the two structural genes are joined at a point approximately eight nucleotides after the first stop codon at the end of pKB750 is constructed as shown in Fig. 3 from two fragments. The first fragment is an The second fragment is a These fragments are joined at their Suitable multipurpose cloning vehicles for making those constructions are pKB707 or pKB766, illustrated in Fig. 4. pKB766 is constructed starting with the Alternatively, pKB663 is used to transform derivatives of YMC9 designated KB285 and KB280 which are described in our co pending European Patent Application, hereby incorporated by reference, entitled Cells and their Use in Methods for Producing Product Compounds and filed the same day as this application.

Other arrangements are possible within the scope of this invention. For example, derivatives of vectors pKB663, pKB712, and pKB750 may be used as expression vectors or derivatives of pKB766 may be used as a precursor to an expression vector into which a suitable foreign promoter is inserted. By the term derivative we mean naturally occurring or engineered variations of the vector that conserve the desired functions.
