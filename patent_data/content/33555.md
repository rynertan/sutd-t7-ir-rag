# Threshold circuit for clutter removal in radar video signals.

## Abstract
Threshold circuit for selecting video signals derived from small stationary and moving objects amidst an abundance of clutter in a harbour area. The threshold voltage generator 1 of this circuit is suitable for detecting the temporal average of ΔP of the positive peak value and the temporal average ΔN of the negative peak value from the AC component of the applied video voltage V
