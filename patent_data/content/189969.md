# Gripper apparatus for stacking a batch of sheets.

## Abstract
Gripper apparatus for stacking a batch of sheets 14 , for example glass sheets, comprises a gripper head 1 having a sheet support 5 for movement to grip the batch of sheets. A roller stop 8 at the bottom of the sheet support 5 engages behind one side of the batch 14 and at least one clamp 15 is movable to grip the batch 14 against the support 5 between that clamp and the stop 8 . Tilting members 29 at the bottom of the support 5 are operable, when the support is in a substantially vertical position, to lift the batch 14 over the roller stop 8 as it is stacked.
