# High density memory cell.

## Abstract
Memory cell spacing can be reduced by using the diffused capacitance enhancement layer 22 of a so called hi C cell as the isolating element between adjacent charge storage regions. This allows elimination of the field oxide 21 normally used for this function. Elimination of the field oxide permits closer packing of the cells.

## Description
HIGH DENSITY MEMORY CELL High capacity, low cost computers rely on very large scale integrated semiconductor information storage devices e.g. semiconductor memories . Semiconductor memories comprise many storage cells interconnected by conductors insulated from the underlying semiconductor by a field oxide layer, i.e., a layer sufficiently thick to prevent electric coupling between the conductor and the semiconductor. Each cell stores information in the form of electrical charge. The amount of charge that is used to represent the information, typically a 11111 or 0 , is a function of various parameters, but is directly dependent on the area occupied by a storage cell on the semiconductor chip.As the area diminishes to meet the goals of modern circuit designers, the amount of charge representing a bit of information decreases to the point where it is difficult for the sense amplifier to detect. Thus techniques to increase the charge storage capacity of a given area of semiconductor have become vital to the continued design progress of electronic information processing hardware. Most contemporary dynamic random access memory DRAM designs rely on charge coupled storage elements.Charge is gated into these storage elements from a gate controlled source in the fashion of insulated gate field effect transistors IGFET . The charge coupled storage element is an MOS capacitor as in a CCD charge coupled device . In a typical storage element, the capacitance per unit area has a depletion layer component that is limited by the impurity level of the substrate. Ignoring gate threshold modifying implants, that impurity level is the same as it is in the gate region of the device, and the latter needs to be moderate in order to obtain appropriately low column and other parasitic capacitances. It has been recognized that the impurity levels in these two regions do not have to be the same. By the addition of selective impurity implantation steps, the doping level of the substrate underlying the charge storage region can be increased, and the charge storage capacity increased, independent of the doping level under the gate.The use of this capacitance enhancement layer has been adopted in DRAM device designs see e.g., U. S. PatentNo. 4,112,575 , and very likely has other applications yet to be realized. It is important to reduce as much as possible the semiconductor area required by each storage cell, and it is this problem to which Applicant s invention is primarily directed. Applicant has now recognized that the capacitance enhancement layer can be utilized for two additional roles as a channel stop between devices, and as an added filter capacitance. Applicant has also recognized that selective utilization of the capacitance enhancement layer in this fashion allows portions of the field insulator to be eliminated. In a well designed DRAM, nearly all of the field insulator is utilized for separation between devices.Elimination of a significant part of the field insulator following the techniques to be described allows for closer packing of devices and the realization of the many advantages of miniaturization. An additional advantage of Applicant s new isolation scheme is to increase the capacitance between the storage capacitor counter electrode field plate and the substrate. This results from reducing the insulator thickness in the isolation region from the conventional thick oxide of 10,000i, to the thin oxide of t2502. The increase in this capacitance is highly desirable in devices which utilize on chip substrate bias generators. In such devices, the substrate essentially floats and experiences voltage bumps as a result of capacitive coupling from active circuit nodes. These voltage bumps are coupled back to other portions of the circuitry and can result in undesirable noise. This capacitance to any stable nodes, such as the field plate helps to filter such voltage bumps and thereby reduce noise.

FIG. 1 illustrates one of many possible multicell arrangements that can be adapted to take advantage of the invention described. The characteristic common to all such multicell designs is a close packed geometry. In the design shown, numerals 11 and 12 denote the locations of charge storage capacitors of adjacent pairs of devices.The charge transfer regions, containing the charge input or source and the gate regions are at 13 and 14 respectively.Typically these comprise a common source and two gates. The details of these regions, and the metallization connected to these regions, as well as the electrodes for the charge storage elements 11 and 12 have been omitted primarily for clarity, but also because the specific details of these elements are not part of the invention.That is, various alternative layouts and metallization arrangements can be used while still realizing the benefits of the invention. The elements that are most relevant to a discussion of the invention are shown in FIG. 2. Here the substrate 20 is shown with selectively grown field insulators, typically an oxide, 21, the capacitance enhancement layer 22, and the two closely spaced charge storage elements 11 and 12. These are shown as p, p and n layers as would be tynical of n channel devices.However, the complementary configuration can be used as well. The gate and source 13 associated with storage element 11, is shown in FIG. 2B. Many configurations are possible for those elements and the one shown, probably the most typical, is shown as exemplary only. It illustrates a source region 30, which here is a diffused bit line, gate 31 and memory field plate 32, with the latter two elements overlying the conventional dielectric layer 33. This drawing, in contrast to FIG. 2A, includes the metallization. The capacitance enhancement layer 22 and the storage layer 11 are essentially as they appear in FIG.2A. FIG. 3, in contrast to FIG. 2A, illustrates the formation of adjacent storage elements without an intervening field oxide or field insulator, in accordance with the invention. A discussion of the different process sequences for the Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 structures will further illustrate the invention. A typical processing sequence for forming theFig. 2 structure is shown in FIGS. 4A to 4E. From a processing point of view, each of these steps taken individually is conventional and need not be described in detail in order for those skilled in the art to practice the invention. FIG. 4A shows substrate 20, usually silicon, having masking portions 41 and 42 formed on the surface as shown to delineate subsequently formed thick oxide regions.The selective process for forming these regions is widely used in various alternative forms. Typically it involves depositing or growing a mask layer, typically silicon nitride, and photolithographically patterning the layer to produce the structure shown in FIG. 4A. The structure is then oxidized to produce the field oxide 21 as shown inFIG. 4B. The edges of the oxide form familiar birds beak configuration at the edges of the nitride masking layer.The nitride mask layer is removed as shown in FIG. 4C.Impurities are then introduced into the exposed portions of substrate 20 to form the capacitance enhancement layer 22 FIG. 4D and impurities of the opposite conductivity type are introduced to form layers 11 and 12 within the boundaries of the capacitance enhancement layer 22.Methods for forming the impurity layers are well known and include for example ion diffusion, i.e., pre deposit from a glass layer or a vapor and drive in by thermal processing, or pre deposit by ion implantation and drive in by thermal processing. The shallow layer can also be formed by implantation of ions directly to the depth desired. The pre deposits can be done separately, or simultaneously. In the latter case, the deep lying impurities can be chosen of a species e.g. boron that diffuses more rapidly than those of the surface layer e.g. arsenic and the two distinct layers created during the thermal drive in step. FIGS. 4D and 4E show these two diffused layers formed separately. The capacitance enhancement layer is shown at 22 in these figures and the shallower n layer is shown at 11 and 12 in FIG. 4E. The impurity levels of these layers and the substrate depend on a variety of design choices. If the electrical potential used to bias the memory plate overlying these storage regions is to be at a relatively high voltage, then inversion of the surface of the storage region will occur without any n doped surface layer, or a lightly doped one. On the other hand, if the memory cell is designed with the memory plate at or near ground potential, the n doped surface layer becomes desirable. Typical impurity levels for this layer are 1018 cm3.Typical depths of this layer are 0.2 m. Typical impurity levels for layer 22 are 1017 cm3 and typical depths are 1pm. Substrate impurity concentrations are conventionally of the order of 1015 cm3. FIG. 4F shows the completed structure with the inclusion of storage capacitor dielectric 23 and the storage capacitor field plate 24. As is typical in this device, a field plate common to the two storage layers 11 and 12 is used. A typical processing sequence according to the invention is shown in FIGS. 5A 5G. This is but one of many possible routes to attain the reduced cell size according to the principles of the invention. The field oxide for the structure is produced in a manner similar to that used in FIGS. 4A and 4B except that the nitride layer 51 inFIG. 5A is continuous and the intermediate oxide portion 21 of FIG. 4B is eliminated. Thus, as shown in FIG. 5B, a structure is produced with field oxide 52 bounding the region to be occupied by two memory plates but without any field oxide between the memory plates. In FIG. 5C, the nitride layer Si, used to define the regions in which field oxide is grown, is shown removed.Techniques and process parameters for the deposition of the nitride mask layer 51, the growth of field oxide 52, the removal of the nitride mask, etc. as well as the other operations to be described, are so well known that recital here is not needed. FIG. 5D shows the formation of the capacitace enhancement layer 53. In the context of the invention, it is useful to have this layer extended continuously, i.e., without the interruption caused by the presence of field oxide as seen in FIG. 4D. In this manner, the capacitance enhancement layer acts to prevent depletion and inversion of the region between storage regions so as to prevent conduction between such regions. A continuous layer is not essential, for reasons that will become evident, but has useful isolating characteristics. FIG. SE shows a mask feature 54 selectively formed by conventional means, i.e., photo, electron beam, ion beam or other appropriate lithographic or mask forming procedure. FIG. 5F shows formation of the n surface layers for the two storage regions 55 and 56 respectively.FIG. 5G shows the mask 54 removed. FIG. 5H shows the completed MOS capacitors, i.e., insulator 57 and the memory field plates 58 and 59 for the two storage elements, respectively, of devices 11 and 12 FIG. 1 . The reduction in the area occupied by two adjacent devices made possible by the use of the invention can be appreciated from FIGS. 6 and 7. FIG. 6 illustrates the minimum separation between storage regions 11 and 12 that can be obtained with a field oxide separating the regions. The length L is the minimum linewidth that a given processing and lithographic technology is capable of producing with reliability and high yield. The increments denoted by t represent the unavoidable increase in that lateral dimension as a consequence of the genetic or native growth mechanism to the required field oxide thickness. That growth mechanism, in current technology is an oxidation mechanism although growth of nitride layers is a potential alternative. The nature of the oxide growth is such that it occurs laterally as well as transverse to the silicon surface. The lateral growth may be nearly equal to the vertical growth. A stripe of one micron thick isolating field oxide that is for example lithographically defined to be two microns wide ends up nearly four microns wide. If the width W of the storage region is of the order of a few microns the encroachment on this region, represented by t , is of the order of 1 micron, resulting in a significant loss of storage capacity. This analysis, so far, is two dimensional. If the other portions of the perimeter of the storage regions 11 and 12 are considered the storage area susceptible to recapture , using the techniques of the invention, are even greater.It will be evident to those skilled in the art, that the usual approach to forming the field insulator is to first mask the silicon surface with a mask layer composed of an insulator of a different material, typically silicon nitride, then open windows in the mask layer where the field insulator is desired, and finally to grow the field insulator in those windows by a well established growth technique. The length L in this case is the dimension of the window formed in the nitride mask layer. FIG. 7 illustrates the advantage of eliminating the field insulator according to the invention. The separation between storage regions is equivalent to L 2d, which is the intended design separation. d corresponds to the lateral diffusion of the implanted impurity 55 and 56 under the mask 54. An alternative way to produce a structure that is nearly equivalent to that of FIG. 7 is evident from the structure shown in FIG. 8. Here the capacitance enhancement layer is not continuous between charge storage regions 11 and 12. The structure is made by applying mask 54 FIG. SE prior to the formation of the capacitance enhancement layer FIG. 5C . It may be advantageous to use a separate mask with a width smaller than the width of mask 54 to form this layer thus ensuring that the charge storage layer is clearly bounded, where desired, by the charge enhancement layer. An examination of FIGS. 6 8 reveals a further benefit of the invention. The lateral diffusion of the storage layers 11 and 12 contribute to the effective storage areas in the configurations shown in FIGS. 7 and 8. In FIG. 6, the presence of the isolating oxide region prevents significant lateral movement of the impurity layers 11 and 12. Various additional modifications and extensions of this invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art. All such variations and deviations which basically rely on the teachings through which this invention has advanced the art are properly considered to be within the spirit and scope of this invention.
