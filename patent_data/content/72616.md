# Combustion cylinder construction for oil space heater of the radiant type.

## Abstract
A combustion cylinder construction 12 for an oil space heater 10 of the radiant type is disclosed which is capable of uniformly red heating an outer surface of any outer cylindric al member 30 of a double combustion cylinder 26 and efficiently radiating heat rays from the red hot outer surface and is capable of completely burning an incomplete combus tion gas or the like, at a flame spreader 46 , to form a white yellow flame and efficiently radiating heat from the flame. The outer cylindrical member has through holes 68, 70, 72 of which the upper holes 70, 68 are larger than the holes 34 in an inner cylindrical member 28 , and is provided at the upper portion thereof with a recess 78 having through holes 80 . The combustion cylinder and flame spreader are sur rounded by a single heat permeable cylinder 56 .
