# A process for the production of polymers and aqueous solutions thereof.

## Abstract
A stable, water dispersable, substantially anhydrous dis persion of water soluble or water swellable polymer particles in water immiscible liquid is made by reverse phase suspension polymerisation and dehydration of the dispersion and is ren dered dispersable in water by the addition of an oil soluble sur factant having HLB above 7.
