# Photoelectrophoretic multicolour imaging apparatus.

## Abstract
Electronic imaging apparatus using multicolor photoconductive particles. The problem of providing color separation in a single exposure cycle, electronically addressable, photoelectrophoretic imaging system is solved by the provision of electronic imaging apparatus using multicolor photoconductive particles, the apparatus comprising an array of separately addressable electrodes E₁ E₆ that are energized selectively in imagewise timed relation with sequential series of light pulses, each pulse being of a wavelength to which only one of the different particle color types in the imaging picture is responsive and each series including at least one pulse of each such wavelength.
