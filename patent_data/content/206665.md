# Color image pickup device.

## Abstract
A color image pickup device comprises an image pickup tube 11 , a color stripe filter 11a comprising a plurality of stripes, a circuit 13, 14, 15, 24 for obtaining a color multiplexed signal by multiplexing color components obtained via the color stripe filter in a direction perpendicular to a scanning direction of the image pickup tube, and a circuit 16 for producing a color demodulated signal by subjecting the color multiplexed signal to a color demodulation. The color stripe filter is arranged on the image pickup tube so that a longitudinal direction of the stripes thereof is substantially parallel to the scanning direction.
