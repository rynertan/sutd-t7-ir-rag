Reference is made to applicants following EuropeanApplications European Patent Application No. , filed entitled Novel Group VA Ylides andProcess for Preparing Same . European Patent Application No. , filed entitled Sulfonated Group VA Ylides and Process for Preparing Same . The disclosures of the foregoing applications are hereby incorporated by reference. Field Of The Invention The present invention relates to novel Group VA salts which are useful in the preparation of nickel ylide catalysts for the oligomerization of ethylene. This invent ion also relates to a process for preparing such GroupVA salts.Description Of The Prior Art It is well known in the art to use a variety of catalysts to oligomerize ethylene to higher molecular weight olef ins. The term oligomerize has been employed, and is employed herein to describe the conversion of lower olefines such as ethylene to olefinic products of higher molecular weight, e.g., to dimer, trimer, tetramer and the like. The reaction rate and product distribution obtained are highly dependent on the exact catalyst composition and the reaction conditions employed. Two such general classes of catalysts are the Ziegler types consisting of aluminum trialkyls and the Ziegler Natta types consisting of aluminum alkyls or alkyl halides and titanium halides.Major disadvantages of aluminum alkyl catalysts are their highly reactive and pyrophoric nature and the fact that they must be used at relatively high temperatures, e.g., 200 275eC. and pressures, e.g., 2000 4000 psig 13,790 to 27,580 kPa . Although much milder reaction conditions are used when the aluminum alkyls are used in conjunction with titanium halides, product quality and ease of catalyst separation from products of both of these prior art types of catalysts are not as high as desired. An article by W. Keim, F.H. Kowaldt, R. Goddard and C. Kruger entitled Novel Coordination of Benzoylmethylene triphenylphosphorane in a Nickel OligomerizationCatalyst , in Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1978 No. 6, page 466, discloses the preparation of a nickel ylide by the following reaction cod 2Ni Ph3P Ph3P CH CO PhEMI3.1 wherein cod represents 1,5 cyclooctadiene and Ph represents phenyl. It is reported that the resultant nickel ylide converts ethylene into alpha olefins or polyethylene. Ahrland et al in an article entltled The Relative Affinities of Coordinating Atoms for Silver Ion. PartII, Nitrogen, Phosphorous and Arsenic , in J. Chem. Soc. 1958 pages 276 288, disclose the sulfonation of triphenylphosphine in fuming sulfuric acid.

To prepare the nickel ylide catalyst defined by Formula II, the salt of this invention is first converted to the corresponding ylide by reacting it with a stoichiometric amount of a base, such as an alkali metal. hydroxide sodium or potassium hydroxide , an alkyl or aryl lithium n butyl lithium, methyl lithium or phenyl lithium , an alkoxide sodium methoxide or potassium t butoxide , a hydrocarbylsubstituted ammonium hydroxide benzyltrimethylammonium hydroxide , ammonium hydroxide, ammonia, etc.This can be done, for example, by suspending or dissolving the salt in a suitable liquid, such as water, an alcohol ethanol or isopropanol , an aromatic benzene or toluene , a hydrocarbon hexane or heptane , etc. The reaction temperature can range from about room temperature to about 200 C., preferably from about room temperature to about 50 C., and the reaction time from about one minute to about four hours, or even longer, but preferably from about one to about two hours. Elevated pressures can be used, although atmospheric pressure will suffice. If the ylide obtained is a solid, recovery can be effected by filtration, decantation or by centrifuging. If the ylide is dissolved in the solvent, simple distillation is sufficient to remove the solvent, leaving behind the solid ylide.In some cases in association with the ylide so recovered will be the salt corresponding to the base that was used. For example, use of sodium hydroxide produces the corresponding sodium salt. The salt and the desired ylide can be separated from each other in any convenient manner, for example, by extraction with a solvent that will dissolve one and not the other. For example, aromatics, such as toluene, can be used to dissolve the ylide, while water can be used to dissolve the salt. The novel ylide obtained can be defined by the following Formula III EMI11.1 wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, F and M are as defined above.
