# Lead frame and package for establishing electrical connections to electronic components.

## Abstract
A lead frame stamped and formed from sheet metal and comprising a plurality of contact arms 1, 2, 3 arranged for connection to respective contact areas of an electronic component 100 , each arm having integrally formed therewith a terminal tab 4, 5, 6 for connection to an external conductor, each tab being formed of a plurality of thicknesses of the sheet metal. The lead frame is part of a package in which it has an electronic component 100 mounted thereon with the contact arms 1, 2, 3 and associated terminal members 4, 5, 6 electrically isolated from each other, a substrate 18 of electrically insulating material being bonded to the contact arms 1, 2, 3 , and a housing 21 in the form of a frame surrounding the substrate 18 , component 100 , contact arms 1, 2, 3 and portions of the tabs 4, 5, 6 , with free end portions of the tabs 4, 5, 6 extending outside the housing 21 , there being encapsulating material 24 filling the housing 21 .
