# VEHICLE WINDOW MOUNTING

## Abstract
There is disclosed an elongate window mounting strip 17 of resiliently deformable material which is adapted to be fitted along a Z shaped edge 13 of a window aperture defined in a vehicle body. The Z shaped edge comprises a base portion 14 having a first limb 15 at its inward end which extends in a direction into the window aperture and a second limb 16 at its outward end which extends away from the window aperture. The mounting strip 17 has a body portion 18 which lies alongside the base portion 14 of the window edge,a mounting recess 19 in one side of the body portion and extending longitudinally of the strip so as to receive the first limb 15 of the window edge to mount the strip in the window aperture, and a sealing lip 20 arranged resiliently to engage the outer surface of the second limb 16 of the window edge when the strip is mounted in the window aperture. The body portion 18 is provided with a window receiving recess 23 in its side opposite to the side having the mounting recess 19 . The arrangement of the mounting strip 17 is such that, when the first limb 15 of the window edge enters the mounting recess 19 and the window 24 enters the window receiving recess 23 , the window is flush mounted in that its outer surface 25 substantially forms a prolongation of the outer surface of the second limb 16 of the window edge. The construction of the mounting strip 17 is such that satisfactory retention of the window 24 is achieved, despite the window being mounted further outwardly than conven tional windowmountings so that there is less material of the mounting strip available to resist dislodgement of the window . Firm window retention is achieved by provision of a resiliently deformable flange portion 27 which defines one side of the window receiving recess 23 and which extends oppositely to the sealing lip 20 . A wedge shaped portion 29 connects the flange portion 27 and the sealing lip 20 to the main body portion 18 of the mounting strip, the wedge shaped portion 29 being operable to apply a window gripping force to the flange portion 27 when the mounting strip is mounted in the window aperture and the window is mounted in its recess.
