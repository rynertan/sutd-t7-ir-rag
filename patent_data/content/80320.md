# Fluid supply and dispensing apparatus.

## Abstract
In a fluid supply and dispensing system including a fluid dispenser 13 for carrying a working supply of fluid at working surface level 50 , and a reservoir 14 which is connected in fluid flow communication with the dispenser for carrying a replenishing supply of fluid at a surface level which establishes the working surface level of fluid in the dispenser, there is provided an improvement for lowering the working surface level to prevent spillage of fluid from the dispenser when the system is not in use. The improvement includes providing the reservoir with a mov able, fluid displacement member 60 , which is normally lowered into the replenishing supply of fluid, and providing means for raising the displacement member at least partially out of the replenishing supply of fluid, when the system is not in use, for lowering the surface level of the replenishing fluid supply and thus the working surface level of the dispenser s working fluid supply.
