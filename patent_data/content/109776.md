# Granular starch ethers having reduced pasting temperatures.

## Abstract
Hydroxypropylation of granular starch in a liquid medium comprising a lower alkanol under alkaline condi tions in a confined zone at high temperature provides a novel improved hydroxypropyl substituted granular starch having a pasting temperature reduced from that of the granular starch before hydroxypropyl substitution by at least 6.5 C for each 1 by weight of hydroxypropyl substitution.
