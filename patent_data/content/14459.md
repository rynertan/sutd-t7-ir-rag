# Process for production of separators for use in cells.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a novel process for the production of a separator for use in a cell to prevent the shortcircuiting of positive active material and negative active material, said process comprising irradiating a polyolefin film 150 Âµm or less thick with ionizing radiation, followed by contacting the irradiated film with an aqueous solution of a terminally unsaturated monomer such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid and the like at a relatively low temperature to thereby cause grafting of the monomer onto the polyolefin film before the grafted polymer film is treated with an aqueous alkaline solution to finally obtain the separator for use in a cell, which is substantially improved in that it shows low electrical resistance and is excellent both in its acid resistance and mechanical strength.
