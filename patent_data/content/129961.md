# Reciprocating internal combustion engine with valve train means.

## Abstract
A valve train for a reciprocating internal combustion engine has a fulcrum means 22 and a rocker arm 21 that define a pair of co operating outer and inner cylindrical bear ing surface conformations 30, 35 , respectively, for carrying the reaction forces of rocker arm pivotal movement, the radius 2R of the outer conformation 30 being substantially two times the radius R of the inner conformation 35 , with the center of revolution of the outer conformation being located on the operating axis of the valve 12 , the inner conformation 35 of the rocker arm 21 being located such that an extension thereof will intersect the contact point X of the rocker arm 21 on the axis of the valve 12 at the free end thereof or on a lifter positioned between the rocker arm and valve. Restrainer means 40,41 are provided to anchor the co operating cylindrical conformations 30,35 for substan tially rolling action in relation to each other. The rocker arm, when used in an overhead cam engine, also carries a cam follower roller rotating about an axis located as on an exten sion of the inner conformation, and this axis and the axis of rotation of the camshaft are on a line that intersects the center of revolution of the outer conformation.
