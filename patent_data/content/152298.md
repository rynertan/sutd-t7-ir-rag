# APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR DERTERMINING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF STERILIZATION

## Abstract
A test container comprises a vial 11 within which is disposed a sealed media containing ampoule 12 and a test strip 14 having a predetermined form of micro organism thereon. A closure member 15 is threadedly engageable with the vial for movement between a first position, which permits entry of sterilizing atmosphere into the vial and into contact with micro organisms on the test strip, and a second position not shown which simultaneously causes fracturing the ampoule 12 and seals at 36 the interior of the vial 11 so that gas generated by viable micro organisms in contact with the media during incubation are contained in the vial. By analyzing the gas generated by the surviving micro organisms a rapid, quantitative indication is given of the effectiveness of the sterilizing procedure.
