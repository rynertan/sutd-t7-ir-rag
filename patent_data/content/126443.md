# A PROCESS FOR THE SELECTIVE PREPARATION OF MICROORGANISMS CAPABLE OF REPRODUCIBLE REDUCTION OF SULFUR AND USE OF THE MICROORGANISM FOR MICROBIAL DESULFURIZATION OF COAL

## Abstract
A process for the preparation of microorganisms, ATCC No. 39 327 which are capable of reproducible reduction of sulfur, particularly organic sulfur, in coal wherein the novel microorganisms are grown in situ enriched with sulfur com pounds and subsequently grown in the presence of a coal substrate and nutrient medium while maintaining an essen tially neutral pH. Contacting an aqueous coal slurry with the novel microorganism of the present invention provides coal having reduced organic sulfur content.
