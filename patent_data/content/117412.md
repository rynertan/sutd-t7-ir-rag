## Description
Propene derivatives and their use as plant growth inhibitors The present invention relates to novel propene derivatives having specific substituents and, more particularly, to a methylenepropionic acids having specific substituents at the ss position thereof and functional derivatives thereof, such as esters, nitriles, etc., as well as 4chromanone derivatives. The compounds are useful as plant growth inhibitors. S Phenoxy a methylenepropionic acid has been reported as an intermediate for the synthesis of 3 methylcoumarin.Further S phenylthio a methylenepropionic acid has been reported as an intermediate for the synthesis of thiochroman3 carboxylic acid iSwaminathan et al, Synthesis Communications, Sept. 1975, page 599, and ibid, June 1976, page 409 .With respect to nucleus substituted derivatives of these compounds, some are merely mentioned ln the articles described above. In these articles, nothing is mentioned with respect to plants. Further, no ester of the aforesaid compounds is mentioned. On the other hand, as nitriles of a methylenepropionic acid having a substituent at the ss position thereof, that is, a substituted acrylonitriles having a substituent of the ACH2 type at the a position thereof, ethoxymethyl, propoxymethyl, cyclohexyloxymethyl, etc. are reported as asubstituents by Movsum Zada E.M., et al, Azerb. Khim. Zh., 5 , 70 73 1976 , and methyithiomethyl is reported as the a substituent by La Combe, E.M., et al, JACS, 83, 3457 3461 1961 .Further, examples of a dimethylaminomethyl group and a dinonylaminomethyl group are disclosed in GnerNathaniel et al, European Patent Application 31584, and a benzylaminomethyl group is mentioned in Congnacq Jean C. et al, Canadian Patent 960,666 however, no effect on plants is mentioned therein. In Japanese Patent Publication No. 1972 77, certain a substituted acrylic acid derivatives are mentioned as plant growth regulators. however, these compounds have a structure of the thiol ester of chain aliphatic thioether type. An object of the present invention is to provide novel, useful compounds and more particularly, to provide useful compounds having an action on plants. This object was attained by synthesizing a series of propene derivatives represented by general formula EMI2.1 wherein A and Bwill be later defined, and confirming the effective actions of these compounds on plants.
