## Description
This invention relates generally to a logic circuit of the differential amplifier kind for performing logic operations on binary input signals and, more particularly, to a logic circuit particularly adapted for integrated circuit fabrication in which a separate reference voltage generating element is not required for the differential amplifier circuit. The particular requirements of integrated circuit fabrication have forced changes in the design of various logic circuits from their original, discrete component designs. For example, the constraints on such logic circuit designs placed by the integrated circuit fabrication techniques have resulted in the use of differential amplifiers and constant current sources as a fundamental building block for such logic circuits, and this kind of logic circuitry is typically referred to as emitter coupled logic ECL . Representative of this technology is U.S. Patent No. 3,259,761. Central to such ECL differential amplifier logic, is the requirement for a reference voltage generator to provide the necessary reference voltage against which the input signals are compared. Further, in order to provide high speed logic circuits, the current that must flow through each logic circuit is necessarily large relative to the quiescent state, and accordingly the number of reference voltage generators must correspond roughly to the scale of the logic circuit, so that they are capable of absorbing the transient currents produced upon switching the various transistors making up the ECL logic circuit. Due to such reference voltage requirements, it is the commonly known technique to employ three transistors to realise a two input OR gate in the ECL differential amplifier configuration. Accordingly, the presently known conventional logic circuits have an inherent disadvantage in that they require a relatively large number of circuit elements. Moreover, because of the requirement to employ the reference voltage an additional wiring pattern for each logic circuit is required and a further disadvantage is present because the ratio of the area of the wiring pattern on the substrate is large, and this leads to corresponding increases in chip size. US A 3515904 discloses logic circuit of the kind employing a differential amplifier having a pair of transistors connected in a common emitter configuration, and a constant current source connected to said differential amplifier and a voltage source comprising Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a logic circuit for fabrication as an integrated circuit that can eliminate the above noted disadvantages inherent in the prior art. In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, the differential amplifier is constructed whereby the value of the constant current source therefor is made relatively small, yet an operating speed substantially the same as that of conventional emitter coupled logic is obtained. Thus, not only is the number of circuit elements reduced but the power consumption required thereby is also reduced. By eliminating the requirements for the reference voltages and the corresponding reference voltage generators for each of the various gate circuits forming the particular logic circuit, the wiring pattern used to supply such reference voltage is eliminated as well and the integrated circuit chip size can be reduced accordingly. The present invention provides a logic circuit of the kind employing a differential amplifier having a plurality of transistors connected in a common emitter configuration, and a constant current source connected to said differential amplifier and a voltage source comprising The above and other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of illustrative embodiments thereof to be read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference numerals refer to like elements.

As known in the prior art, emitter coupled logic circuits typically fabricated in an integrated circuit configuration require various reference voltage levels in order to make the logical comparisons. Fig. 1 is a circuit diagram of such prior art emitter coupled logic circuit, in which three transistors 10, 12, and 14 have respective emitters connected in common to a common or return line having terminal 15 through a resistor 16 that functions as a constant current source. One input signal terminal 18 is connected to the base lead connection of first transistor 10 and the other input signal terminal 20 is connected to the base lead of second transistor 12. The required reference voltage is then connected to the base lead of third transistor 14. The respective collector circuits of transistors 10 and 12 are connected together through resistor 24 to voltage source terminal 26, and such collectors also provide one output signal of the logic circuit at terminal 28 through an emitter follower configuration transistor 30. The emitter follower configuration of transistor 30 being accomplished by resistor 32 connected between the emitter lead of transistor 30 and the common or return line terminal 15. In reference voltage transistor 14, the collector circuit is connected through resistor 34 to the power source terminal 26 and is similarly connected to the base lead of transistor 36 that is also connected in emitter follower configuration. The other output at terminal 38 is provided by emitter follower transistor 36 across emitter resistor 40 connecting the emitter circuit of transistor 36 to return or common line terminal 15. In the circuit of Fig. 1 and assuming that the inputs A and B at terminals 18 and 20, respectively, would be at substantially the same levels typically produced by such circuit at output terminals 28 and 38, the logic functions of this circuit are shown in Fig. 3, that is, this logic circuit functions as an OR gate and a NOR gate. The relative voltage levels of the high and low signal levels of the inputs at 18 and 20 in relation to the reference voltage V Accordingly, it is seen in this known emitter coupled logic circuit three transistors are required at a minimum in order to constitute a logic element, such as an OR gate. Fig. 5 is a schematic diagram of a logic circuit according to an embodiment of the present invention in which transistors 42 and 44 comprise a pair forming a differential amplifier. A first input terminal 46 receives a first binary input signal A that is fed to the base circuit of transistor 44, and a second input terminal 48 receives a second binary input B and that is fed to the base circuit of second transistor 44. The constant current source is provided by resistor 50 that is connected between the common emitter connection of transistors 42 and 44 and a common or return line having terminal 51. The collector circuit of transistor 42 is connected to the appropriate source voltage terminal 52 through a resistor 54, and the collector circuit of transistor 42 is also connected to the base lead of an emitter follower transistor 56. Emitter follower transistor 56 has its emitter lead connected through series connected resistors 58 and 60 to the common or return line having terminal 51 and one output terminal 62a The collector circuit of transistor 44 is similarly connected to voltage source terminal 52 through resistor 64 and is also connected to a base lead of output transistor 66 that is connected in the emitter follower configuration. Transistor 66 has emitter resistors 68 and 70 connected in series to the return line that can be connected at terminal 51 to electrical ground potential. Another output signal X is obtained at the connection between the emitter lead of transistor 66 and resistor 68 at terminal 72A, and the output X may be obtained at terminal 72 connected at the node between resistors 68 and 70. As will be seen from the circuit of Fig. 5, resistors 60 and 70 comprise constant current source resistors for output transistors 56 and 66, respectively. Because this is a logic circuit having outputs and inputs that are balanced, resistors 54 and 64 will have the same values and, similarly, resistors 58 and 68 will also have the same values. The values of resistors 60 and 70 are selected so that the constant current provided thereby will have a magnitude approximately 1 2 that of the constant current provided by resistor 50. The operation of the circuit of Fig. 5 is represented by the relative voltage levels of Fig. 6, in which inputs A and B have the same amplitude differences VL between the high and low levels. Compared with input A, input B has levels of H and L , which are shifted by an amount 1 2 VL from levels H and L, respectively. Thus, the relationships between resistors 60, 70, and 50 are seen. In regard to the absolute voltage levels, assuming that the source voltage applied at input terminal 52 is Vcc, and the voltage drop across the base and emitter of a transistor is VBE, then the relative levels are seen as follows For example, assuming that A L and input B L , then transistor 42 is turned ON and transistor 44 is turned OFF and a constant current I flows through transistor 42. The collector potential of transistor 42 then becomes Vcc IR , when the resistance value of resistor 54 is represented by R. Thus, output Continuing with this example, the collector voltage of transistor 44 will be Vcc and the output X at terminal 72A will be The relationships between the inputs and outputs in the embodiment of Fig. 5 relative to positive logic circuit are represented by the following table The logic circuit provided by the embodiment of Fig. 5 is shown in conventional circuit design notation in Fig. 7. Moreover, in the practical situation both the positive output and negative output can be obtained and the fundamental logic circuits represented as AND, NAND, OR, and NOR can be realized by selecting from among the outputs X, X , Referring then to Fig. 8, the collectors of transistors 42 and 44 are connected through collector resistors 54 and 64, respectively, that are connected in common to a current source resistor 76 having a magnitude selected as 1 2 R, based on resistor 54 being assigned the value R. Resistor 76 is then connected to the power source input at terminal 52. In the circuit of Fig. 8, output X and Similarly in Fig. 9, by connecting the emitter of the emitter follower configuration transistors 56 and 66 to resistors 58 and 68, respectively, connected to the common line and connecting terminal 51 to ground, providing a resistor 78 as a constant current source between the collector of transistor 44 and the grounded return line, and by selecting the constant current that flows through resistor 78 to be 1 2 I, the output X can be obtained at terminal 62A and the output Another embodiment of the present invention that can accept four binary input signals is shown in Fig. 10 in which transistors 42, 44, and 80, 82 comprise a differential amplifier, a first input A applied at terminal 46 is connected to the base lead of transistor 42 and a second input B supplied at terminal 84 is applied to the base lead of transistor 80. A third input C is supplied at terminal 48 and applied to the base lead of transistor 44 and a fourth input D is supplied at terminal 86 and is fed to the base lead of fourth transistor 82. The collectors of transistors 42 and 80 are connected in common to the base of emitter follower output transistor 56 and are also connected through resistor 54 to the voltage source at terminal 52. Output terminal 62A provides In order to better represent the relationships among the voltage levels of the four inputs and two outputs of the circuit of Fig. 10, attention is directed to Fig. 11, in which inputs A and B are binary signals each having possible amplitude levels L and H and inputs C and D are also binary signals having possible amplitude levels L and H . The signals A and B have the same logic amplitude, as do the binary signals C and D . Additionally, there is a difference of 1 2 VL between the corresponding levels of the pair of signals A and B and the pair of signals C and D . When the embodiment of Fig. 10 is represented as employing positive logic, the functional equivalent of the logic circuit of Fig. 12 can be obtained. The corresponding relationship between the inputs and outputs of the circuit of Fig. 12 may be easily determined from the following table. Other combinations of inputs that are not shown in the above table are also possible, in which for example, X H and As indicated hereinabove, the present invention can also provide in addition to the above described logic elements an R S flip flop. Such flip flop being of the kind known in the prior art and shown in Fig. 4 as typically comprising two NOR gates. Referring back to Fig. 4 it is seen that a conventional R S flip flop can be constituted by two ECL NOR gates and a set input S is supplied to an input of one NOR gate, a reset input R is supplied to one input of the other NOR gate, and the outputs of the two NOR gates are connected to the remaining inputs of the respectively opposite NOR gates, with the outputs of the two NOR gates representing the circuit outputs. In conventional emitter coupled logic, each of the NOR gates of the prior art R S flip flop of Fig. 4 is embodied in accordance with the circuit of Fig. 1 and requires an input reference voltage and a reference voltage transistor. An R S flip flop can be realized according to the present invention by combining two of the logic circuits as shown in Fig. 12 in the manner shown in Fig. 13. In which case, two set inputs S1 and S2 are fed to one OR gate and two reset inputs R1 and R2 are supplied to the other OR gate. An output Q of one logic circuit is supplied to another of the OR gates of the embodiment of Fig. 12, as is the output An equivalent representation of the circuit of Fig. 13 is shown in Fig. 14 in which the NOR gates comprising the flip flop are represented in general by a flip flop F F, and the remaining input OR gates are connected to the set input S and reset input R of the R S flip flop F F. Therefore, the present invention is quite suitable for applications involving a plurality of set inputs or reset inputs fed to a flip flop. The circuit of Fig. 13 is shown in more detail in Fig. 15 in which one logic circuit is formed of transistors 42, 80, 44, and 66, while the other logic circuit is provided by transistors 88, 90, 92, and 94. Transistors 42, 80, and 44 comprise a differential amplifier in which one set input S1 supplied to terminal 46 is connected to the base lead of transistor 42 and the other set input S2 supplied at input terminal 84 is supplied to the base lead of transistor 80. Similarly, a second differential amplifier is comprised of transistor 88, 90, and 92 and a first reset input R1 supplied to input terminal 94 is applied to the base lead of transistor 88 and a second reset input R2 supplied to input terminal 96 is applied to the base lead of transistor 90. A constant current similar to that provided by resistor 50 is provided by resistor 97. The collector output of transistor 44 is connected to the base lead of a emitter follower transistor 66 and is level shifted by operation of emitter resistor 68 and is also connected to the base lead of transistor 92. Similarly, the collector output of transistor 92 is fed to the base lead of an emitter follower transistor 94, is level shifted by resistor 98, and is fed to the base lead of transistor 44. The output Q is then obtained at the node between emitter follower resistors 68 and 70 and the output The timing of the R S flip flop of Fig. 15 is shown in Fig. 16 in which it is seen that when the set input S1 or S2 rises from lower level L to the higher level H, the flip flop is reset and transistor 42 or 80 is turned ON and transistor 44 is turned OFF. Accordingly, output Q will rise from the low level L to a relatively higher level H and transistor 92 in the second differential amplifier will be turned ON and transistor 88 and 90 in such differential amplifier will be turned OFF. Thus, output Another embodiment that is possible according to the present invention that is similar to that shown in Fig. 13 is shown in Fig. 17. In the R S flip flop of Fig. 17, a set input S and a set input control signal A are supplied to the inputs of a NOR gate of one of the logic circuits, while a reset input R and a reset input control signal B are supplied to a NOR gate of the other of the two logic circuits. This can be equivalently shown in Fig. 18 in which the two NOR gates are connected respectively to the set input and reset input of the R S flip flop F F , and such flip flop is operative only by the inputs that are supplied to the two respective NOR gates. More specifically, the set input S can pass through first NOR gate only when the set input control signal A is at the low level L and the reset input R can pass through the other NOR gate only when the reset input control signal B is at the low level L . In this way, the R S flip flop of the so called clock synchronization kind can be realized by providing such prohibition gates. In the conventional prior art arrangement, four differential amplifiers are required because the R S flip flop and the NOR gates must be individually constituted. Nevertheless, according to the present invention the R S flip flop of the so called clock synchronization kind can be comprised of a relatively few number of circuit elements. Fig. 19 shows the circuit diagram of an R S flip flop that corresponds to the arrangement shown generally in Fig. 18, in which one logic circuit is comprised of transistors 42, 80, 44, and 66 and the other logic circuit is comprised of transistors 88, 90, 92, and 94. More specifically, one differential amplifier consists of transistor 42, 80, and 44 and the set input S supplied at terminal 46 is fed to the base lead of transistor 42, and the set input control signal A supplied to input terminal 84 is connected to the base lead of transistor 80. A second differential amplifier is made up of transistors 88, 90, and 92 and the reset input R supplied to input terminal 94 is connected to the base lead of transistor 88 and the reset input control signal B supplied to input terminal 96 is connected to the base lead of transistor 90. The collector output of transistor 44 is fed to the base lead of an emitter follower transistor 66 and the emitter output thereof is supplied to the base lead of transistor 92. Similarly, the collector output of transistor 92 is fed to the base lead of a second emitter follower transistor 94 and the output thereof is fed to the base lead of transistor 44. Therefore, the output The timing of the circuit of Fig. 19 is represented in Fig. 20, in which it is seen that when the set input S that is fed in through input terminal 46 to the base of transistor 42 falls from the relatively high level H to the relatively low level L and the flip flop is reset and when the set input control signal A is at the low level, transistors 42 and 80 are turned OFF and transistor 44 is turned ON, because the level L is lower than the base potential L of transistor 44. Thus, output As may be seen then from the timing chart of Fig. 20, the R S flip flop of Fig. 19 can be used as the so called clock synchronization R S flip flop if the set input control signal A and the reset input control signal B are formed by a common clock input signal CK . This configuration is represented schematically in Fig. 21. A further example of an R S flip flop that may be constituted using a single logic circuit according to the present invention is shown in Fig. 22. More particularly, a set input 5 can be supplied to both inputs of an OR gate, the reset input R supplied to one input of a NOR gate, and the outputs of the OR gate and the NOR gate are both supplied to respective inputs of a second NOR gate. The output of such second NOR gate is then supplied as the second input to the first NOR gate, to which the reset input R was supplied. In order to realize the configuration of the circuit of Fig. 22 a schematic of an embodiment of the present invention is shown in Fig. 23, in which transistors 44 and 82 comprise differential amplifiers and the collectors of these differential amplifiers are connected together. The set input S then is supplied to input terminal 46 and applied to the base lead of transistor 42 and the reset input R supplied to input terminal 48 is applied to the base lead of transistor 44. The collector circuit of transistor 42 is connected to the voltage source at terminal 52 through a collector resistor 54, and the collector of transistor 42 is also connected to the base lead of output transistor 56, which is connected in the emitter follower configuration. The emitter of transistor 56 is connected to the return line, which is connected at terminal 51 to relative ground potential, through series connected resistors 58 and 60. At the node of resistors 58 and 60 is connected the base lead of transistor 82 and at this point also the output The operation of the R S flip flop circuit of Fig. 23 is represented in the timing chart of Fig. 24, in which it is seen that when the set input S rises from the low level L to the high level H while in the reset state, the output Referring back to the R S flip flop circuit of Fig. 23, because this flip flop uses a single differential amplifier as the fundamental constructional element, the number of elements is minimized and, therefore, time delay due to collector capacitance of the transistors and the like is also held correspondingly small and, thus, the circuit of Fig. 23 provides high speed operation. A still further example of the present invention in which an R S flip flop can be provided having multiple inputs and multiple outputs is shown in Fig. 25. In the circuit of Fig. 25, one differential amplifier is formed of two transistors 42 and 80 and the input signal S1 supplied at terminal 46 is applied to the base lead of transistor 42 and the other set input S2 supplied at input terminal 84 is applied to base lead of transistor 80. The collector leads of these two transistors forming the first differential amplifier are connected together in the known fashion. The second differential amplifier is formed from transistors 44 and 80 and reset input signal R1 supplied at input terminal 48 is fed to the base lead of transistor 44 and the second reset signal R2 supplied to terminal 86 is fed to the base lead of transistor 82. Again, as in the conventional differential amplifier configuration, the collectors of transistors 44, 82, and 100 are connected together. The collector node of transistors 42 and 80 is connected to the power source input terminal 52 through resistor 54 and this collector node is also connected to the base lead of transistor 56 that is connected in the common emitter configuration. More specifically, the emitter lead of transistor 56 is connected to relative ground potential at terminal 51 through series resistors 58 and 60. The collector node of transistors 44, 82, and 100 is connected to the power source terminal 52 through resistor 64, and this common collector node is also connected to the base lead of emitter follower transistor 66. The emitter of transistor 66 is connected to relative ground potential through a series connection of resistors 68 and 102. The Throughout the above embodiments, although a resistor or resistor combination has been employed as a constant current source, a constant current source arranged to apply a predetermined DC voltage between the base and emitter of the appropriate transistors could be utilized as well.
