# Improvements in and relating to can openers.

## Abstract
A can opener providing a circular cut around the cylin drical wall of a can below the lid and rim which are severed by the cut from the rest of the can. A pair of body members 12, 14 having integrally formed handles 12a, 14a are pi voted to one another. A rotatable spindle 16 attached to a driving wheel 24 drives the can opener. A cutting wheel 36 forms a nip with the driving wheel in an operating position to force the cutting edge 37 to penetrate through the wall of the can. A mounting plate 30 carrying the cutting wheel is slidably supported by one body member 12 and is mov able by cam means between the operating position and a retracted position as the body members are pivoted between their limits of pivoting. To prevent twisting of the body mem bers and their integral handles, cooperating flanges 52 and recess 50 are provided between the body members and their handles. In the retracted position the wheel withdraws into an upstanding guard whose edge abuts the severed top and displaces it.
