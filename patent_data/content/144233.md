# Method and apparatus for performing a thermal transfer recording.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for performing a thermal transfer recording, uses an ink ribbon 14 having a plurality of ink parts 21a, b, c which are coated with ink of different colors. The ink parts are successively arranged in a longitu dinal direction of the ink ribbon. First, when performing a recording with a first ink, an information is recorded on a recording paper 12 by use of the first color ink, and at the same time, synchronization marks 42 are also recorded by use of the first color ink. Next, when performing a recording with a second color ink, the information is recorded on the recording paper which is pre recorded with the first color ink, by use of a second color ink, in synchronism with the synchronization marks which are detected.
