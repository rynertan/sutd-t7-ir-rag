## Description
METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR RIVETING FASTENERS TO A BELT The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for securing rows of belt fasteners by rivets to belt ends. The method and apparatus of the present invention are particularly directed to installation of fasteners on conveyor belts. Two types of fasteners which are commonly used to join conveyor belt ends are plate belt fasteners, examples of which are shown inU.S. Patent No. 3,141,346, and hinge belt fasteners, examples of which are shown in U.S. Patents No. 3,742,557 and No. 3,176,358. Plate fasteners form a generally rigid, inflexible connection between adjacent belt ends. Hinge fasteners form a pivotal connection. Both types of fasteners are generally made of metal and include upper and lower plates. They are secured to a belt end by placing the belt end between the upper and lower plates and riveting the plates to the belt. Installation of a rivet generally involves driving a rivet assembly downward through a perforation in an upper fastener plate, through the thickness of the belt, and through a perforation in a lower fastener plate, and then deforming the lower end of the rivet to secure it in place. The belt material is compressed somewhat as the rivets are installed. The preferred rivet assembly typically includes a nail which is pointed at its lower end for piercing the belt and a rivet having a hollow lower end which is adapted to be flared outwardly by a shoulder on the nail, as described in U.S. Patent No. 3,913,180. Deforming the lower end of the rivet while simultaneously compressing the belt material requires a relatively great amount of force, as does piercing the belt material with the nails.Proper installation of the rivets generally involves striking the rivet assembly with a pneumatic hammer or a conventional hammer while the rivet assembly is aligned with the perforations in the fastener plates and maintained substantially perpendicular to the belt. In the past, riveting fasteners to belt ends has generally been accomplished by manually guiding the rivet assemblies into the perforations in the fasteners and individually driving each rivet assembly with a hammer. Manual alignment of the rivets requires that each rivet assembly be hit relatively softly at first to start it through the belt, then hit harder to force it completely through the belt and deform the lower end of the rivet. Because the belts are generally relatively tough, the impact forces required are substantial. One major disadvantage of installing rivets in this manner is that it is difficult and time consuming. If a rivet is not kept properly aligned as it is driven, it may fail to seat properly or may bend, requiring it to be pulled out and replaced, which detracts greatly from the efficiency of the operation.An additional disadvantage is that imprecise hammer blows may injure the hands of workers holding the rivets. The guide block described and illustrated in U.S. Patent No. 4,344,213 has been suggested as an alternative to guiding the rivet assemblies manually as they are being installed. While use of a guide block of this type may reduce or eliminate the safety hazards related to manually guiding the rivets, apparatus of the type described in the 213 patent has not found wide usage because it is frequently more time consuming for a skilled riveter to load the guide block and then drive each rivet than simply to drive the rivets while guiding them manually. Conveyor belts of the type described herein are commonly used in applications where it is desirable that repair of belts be accomplished quickly. For example, such belts are used in mines where time spent in repair of belts represents costly down time for mining operations. For this reason, there is a continuing need for more time efficient methods of securing fasteners to belt ends in connection with on site repair and replacement of belts. It is a general object of the present invention to provide an improved method and apparatus for securing belt fasteners to belt ends in the field. The invention provides apparatus for use in riveting a row of belt fasteners having upper and lower plates to a belt end by driving a plurality of elongated rivet assemblies through perforations in the upper and lower fastener plates and through a belt end positioned therebetween, the apparatus comprising, in combination a base for supporting the belt end and belt fasteners, locking means for maintaining the fasteners in a predetermined position on the base, a guide means positioned above the fasteners and having a plurality of bores formed through it for guiding the rivet assemblies into the perforations in the fastener plates, alignment means for interconnecting the guide means and base in predetermined relation so that the bores in the guide means are aligned with the perforations in the fastener plates, and drive means for simultaneously driving a plurality of rivet assemblies disposed within the bores of the guide means by distributing impact force from a single hammer simultaneously to the rivet assemblies. The invention also provides a method for use in sequentially riveting a row of belt fasteners having upper and lower plates to a belt end by driving a plurality of elongated rivet assemblies through perforations in the upper and lower belt fastener plates and through a belt end positioned therebetween, comprising the steps of loading a plurality of rivet assemblies into a plurality of vertical bores in a guide means, placing a row of belt fasteners upon a base and securing the fasteners thereon, placing a belt end between the upper and lower fastener plates securing the belt to the base, positioning the guide means above the fasteners so that the vertical bores in the guide means are substantially aligned with a plurality of the perforations in the fastener plates, and simultaneously driving a group of rivet assemblies through a group of perforations in the fastener plates and through the belt end so that the lower ends of the rivet assemblies are deformed by the anvil means. Thus, in accordance with the present invention, a plurality of rivet assemblies for securing fasteners to belt ends are disposed within elongated bores in a guide block prior to installation and may be driven simultaneously by a hammer in combination with an impact distributing driver. The driver transmits impact force from a single hammer simultaneously to a group of rivet assemblies. The driver herein comprises a cap with a plurality of elongated drive rods extending downwardly therefrom to be received within the bores of the guide block so that the lower ends of the drive rods contact the upper ends of the rivets. The number of drive rods is preferably equal to the number of rivets for a single fastener. To maintain alignment of the guide block bores with the perforations in the fasteners, novel alignment means is employed to position the guide block precisely in a predetermined position with respect to the base. The bottom of the guide block may be beveled so as to be substantially coplanar with the upper surfaces of hinge type fasteners prior to installation of the rivets The advantages of the present invention are achieved without substantially increasing the amount of equipment beyond that used in the past. The following is a description of a specific embodiment of the invention, reference being made to the accompanying drawings in which FIGURE 1 is a fragmentary perspective view of apparatus embodying the present invention showing four fasteners in place on the base, FIGURE 2 is a perspective view of a guide block assembly and driver in accordance with the present invention, FIGURE 3 is a fragmentary plan view of the apparatus of FIGURE 1 showing four fasteners and a fragmentary portion of a belt end, and not showing the guide block assembly or driver, FIGURE 4 is an elevational sectional view of the apparatus of FIGURE 1 taken substantially along line 4 4 and looking in the direction of the arrows, and FIGURE 5 is an elevational sectional view of a fastener which has been riveted to a belt end in accordance with the present invention. The present invention is generally embodied in a method and apparatus for securing rows of perforated belt fasteners by rivets to belt ends. While the embodiment of the invention hereinafter described and illustrated in the drawings is for securing hinge fasteners to belt ends, it will be understood that the present invention may also be embodied in a method and apparatus for securing plate fasteners to belt ends. The apparatus herein generally includes a base 10 having a generally horizontal portion 12 which supports a plurality of anvil plates 14. As best seen in FIGURE 4, apertures 16 and 18 corresponding to countersunk holes or perforations 20 and 21 in the fasteners 22 are formed through the anvil plates 14 and the underlying horizontal portion 12 of the base respectively. Each of the apertures 16 in the anvil plates is substantially centered in a button 24 which comprises a generally circular, upwardly extending rim.As described in greater detail below, each of the apertures and buttons cooperates with one of the rivet assemblies 26 as the rivet assemblies are driven downward, The width of the belt 28 determines the minimum length of the base 10. The drawings herein illustrate a base segment appraximately 12 inches 305 cms in length mace a length of steel channel. Belts typically have widths of, for exairple, 24, 42, or 60 inches 610, 1065, 1525 crrs Each of the hinge type fasteners 22 herein includes an upper plate 32 and a lower plate 34 which are joined by flexible, generally U shaped center hinge portions 36 which are adapted to interfit with oppositeU shaped portions of fasteners on an adjacent belt end not shown to form a hinge structure to receive a hinge pin not shown .The countersunk holes or perforations 20, 21 for receiving rivets are formed in a predetermined pattern through each fastener plate 32, 34, the upper fastener plates 32 being countersunk on their top surfaces 40 and the lower fastener plates being countersunk on their bottom surfaces 42. The preferred fastener plates each have five perforations arranged in a W shaped pattern. The fasteners are manufactured in rows with their lower plates 34 joined along the sides. The upper plates 32 are not connected to one another. Prior to installation, the upper plates 32 are upwardly inclined from the U shaped portions 36 to facilitate insertion of the belt end 44 between the upper and lower plates.Installation of the rivets 46 FIG. 4 pushes the upper plates 32 downward, flexing the U shaped portions 36 so that the belt end 44 is squeezed between the upper and lower plates as shown in FIG. 5. The fasteners 22 are maintained in a predetermined position by engagement of the countersunk portions 48 of the lower fastener plates 34 with the upwardly facing buttons 24 on the anvil plates 14, and are locked into place by a gauge pin 50 which extends through the U shaped portions 36 of the fasteners 22 and through horizontal bores 52 in lugs 54 on the base. In the illustrated embodiment, each of the lugs 54 has a second bore 55 parallel to the first and may be rotated 1800 about a vertical axis to accommodate fasteners of a different size not shown . The belt 28 is maintained in position by clamping means 56 which herein comprises a generally horizontal clamping member 57 with screws 59 FIG. 4 at each end for applying downward pressure to the clamping member. The preferred clamping member 57 is a length of square tubing. Each screw 59 comprises a generallyL shaped rod having a threaded portion 118 at its lower end and a nut 120 fixed to it above the threaded portion. The threaded portions 118 of the screws are received in threaded bores 122 in the anvil plates 14 at the corners of the base. Clockwise rotation of the screws 59 forces the nuts 120 downward against the bottom 124 of the tube to clamp the belt in place. To rivet a row of fasteners 22 to the belt 28, the belt end 44 is inserted between the upper and lower fastener plates 32 and 34, and rivet assemblies 26 are driven downwardly through the perforations 20 in the upper fastener plate, through the thickness of the belt end 44, and through the perforations 21 in the lower fastener plate. Referring particularly to FIG. 4, each of the illustrated rivet assemblies 26 includes a rivet 46 having a hollow lower end for receiving the upper end of an interfitting detachable nail 60. The rivet has a head 61 at its upper end. The nail has a sharpened point 62 at its lower end for piercing the belt material and guiding the rivet assembly through the perforations 20, 21 in the fasteners and apertures 16 in the anvil plates 14, an integral upwardly extending pin at its upper end which fits within the hollow lower end of the rivet 46, and an integral annular shoulder 66 formedDust below the pin 64. As a rivet assembly 26 is driven downward, the shoulder 66 seats in the button 24, arresting the downward progress of the nail 60. As the lower end 58 of the rivet 46 passes through the perforation 21 in the lower fastener plate 34, the upper surface of the button 24 flares the hollow lower end outwardly as described inU.S. patent 4,258,461. As described in greater detail below, the rivet assemblies 26 are aligned and guided as they are driven by a plurality of substantially vertical bores 70 in a guide means 78. In the past, the rivet assemblies have been driven one at a time, and have generally been guided by hand as they are driven. Driving rivet assemblies in this manner is time consuming and presents safety hazards. In accordance with the present invention, an impact distributing driver 74 is employed to transmit impact force from a single hammer 75 simultaneously to a plurality of rivet assemblies disposed within the bores 70 of the guide means 78. The preferred driver 74 includes an impact upper end or cap 76 for receiving hammer blows and a plurality of downwardly extending drive rods 77 which are fixed at their upper ends to the cap and adapted to be received within the bores 70 of the guide block 72. The drive rods are preferably arranged in a group corresponding to a group of perforations 20, 21 in a single fastener plate 32, 34 so that all of the rivet assemblies 26 for a particular fastener 22 may be driven simultaneously.The guide block 72 is part of the guide means or block assembly 78 which preferably includes alignment means 80 for maintaining the guide block in one of a plurality of predetermined positions with respect to the base 10.The bottom 82 of the guide block 72 may be beveled so that the lower ends 84 of the bores 70 are all directly adjacent their associated perforations 20 in the inclined upper fastener plate 32 with no substantial gap therebetween. Turning now to a more detailed description of the illustrated embodiment of the present invention, the cap 76 is preferably metallic and has a generally planar top surface 86 for receiving hammer blows. The cap 76 has a peripheral surface 88 which is generally cylindrical except for a flat portion 90 FIGURE 2 which permits the driver to be placed on an inclined surface between uses without rolling and provides a visual aid to facilitate proper orientation of the driver. A rounded edge 92 is formed at the intersection of the top surface 86 and the peripheral surface 88. In the illustrated embodiment, the drive rods 77 are arranged in a generally W shaped group corresponding to a standard arrangement of perforations in hinge fasteners. The drive rods 77 herein are generally cylindrical. Their upper ends are held in cavities not shown formed in the bottom of the cap 76, and their lower ends 95 are chamfered to facilitate their insertion into the bores 70 of the guide block 72. The cap and drive rods are preferably made of hardened steel. The preferred guide block 72 is made of a high modulus elastomer and supported in a relatively rigid frame 94. The bores 70 are arranged in a plurality of groups 96. Each group 96 corresponds to the apertures 20, 21 in a single fastener plate 32, 34. The upper ends 98 of the bores are countersunk to facilitate insertion of the rivet assemblies 26 from above. The bores 70 are dimensioned to provide an interference fit with the annular shoulders 71 FIG. 5 of the rivet assemblies 26 so that the rivet assemblies may be retained within the bores prior to being driven.The elasticity df the block permits the rivet assemblies 26 to be driven through the bores 70 with relatively little resistance. The frame 94 which supports the block 72 comprises a metal body 100 having a generally rectangular opening 102 FIGURE 4 to accommodate the block and including alignment means 80 to provide precise positioning of the guide block relative to the base 10. The preferred alignment means 80 comprises a pair of downwardly extending rods 104 which are received in a close sliding fit within vertical bores 105 in collars 106 fixed to the base 10. A handle 108 extends upwardly from the body 100 to facilitate manual shifting of the guide block assembly. In the illustrated embodiment, the guide block 72 has four groups 96 of bores 70 formed in it so that four fasteners 22 may be riveted without shifting the guide block assembly 78. The collars 106 are positioned at evenly spaced intervals equal to two fastener widths along the base 10, and the alignment rods 104 on the frame 94 are spaced by substantially the same interval,so that the guide block may be conveniently shifted between sets of four fasteners. Turning now to the method of the present invention, the method generally comprises the steps of positioning the fasteners 22 on the base 10, inserting the belt end 44 between the upper and lower fastener plates 32 and 34, and successively driving groups of rivet assemblies 26 downward through the fasteners and belt end. The first step is to place a row of fasteners 22 on the anvil plates 14. The engagement between the upwardly extending buttons 24 on the anvil plates 14 and the countersunk portions 48 of the lower fastener plates 34 enables the fasteners 22 to be readily positioned on the base 10 so that the U shaped portions 36 of the fasteners 22 and the horizontal bores 52 of the lugs 54 are substantially aligned. The gauge pin 50 is then inserted through the U shaped portions and the bores to lock the fasteners 22 in place. Once the row of fasteners has been thus secured, the belt end 44 and guide block 72 may be positioned. The belt end 44 is inserted under the clamping bar 57 and between the upper and lower fastener plates 32 and 34, and pushed forward until its leading edge 110 abuts a row of tabs 111 which extend upwardly from the lower plates 34.The screws 59 are then turned so that the clamping bar 57 descends to secure the belt 28 in place. The guide block assembly 78 is positioned in any of a plurality of predetermined positons by inserting the alignment rods 104 into a pair of adjacent collars 106 and lowering the guide block 72 so that the bottom 82 of the guide block rests on a set of fasteners. The rivet assemblies 26 may be loaded into the guide block 72 prior to positioning it above the fasteners 22, or in the alternative may be loaded after the guide block 72 is in position. In accordance with the present invention, a plurality of rivet assemblies 26 are then driven simultaneously. To this end, the driver 74 is positioned above the guide block 72 and the drive rods 77 are inserted downwardly into a plurality of the vertical bores 70. Downward impact forces are applied to the upper cap surface 86 by a hammer 75 or the like to drive the rivet assemblies 26 downward until the shoulders 66 seat in the buttons 24 and the lower ends 58 FIG. 5 of the rivets 46 are flared outward. In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the drive rods 77 correspond in number and position to the perforations 20 in a single fastener plate 32 so that all of the rivets 46 for a particular fastener may be driven simultaneously. It is clear that the driver 74 need not be held with one hand while the hammer 75 is being wielded by the other hand. Often workers hit their fingers if they must hold the driver. Also, when workers hold the driver, they usually apply lighter blows in fear of hitting themselves. But with the five drive rods 77, the driver 74 is clearly held stable, as shown in FIGURE 4 by the guide block 72 and a very heavy blow from a very large and heavy hammer can be delivered. This speeds the riveting process. The standard hinge fasteners 22 illustrated and described herein have five apertures arranged in aW shaped group 114 on each plate 32, 34. It will be appreciated that the method and apparatus of the present invention may have various embodiments for use with different types of fasteners having various numbers of perforations arranged in various patterns. It will also be appreciated that the driver could be configured to drive less than the total number of rivets for a single fastener, or could be configured to drive a multiple of that number so that more than one fastener could be secured without shifting the driver between positions. After securing one fastener 22 to the belt end 44, the driver 74 is removed from the guide block 72 and shifted to the next group 96 of bores 70 to secure a second fastener 22 to the belt. This is repeated until an entire set of fasteners have been secured to the belt end 44. In the illustrated embodiment there are four fasteners in a set. At that point, the guide block assembly 78 is lifted to remove the alignment rods 104 from their associated collars 106 and the assembly 78 is shifted to a second position to rivet a second set of four fasteners to the belt end. The above steps are generally repeated until fasteners 22 have been secured to the belt end 44 across its entire width. To speed the operation, several guide block assemblies 78 may be used with a second person off loading one guide block assembly with rivet assemblies 26 while another person is hammering the rivet assemblies into the belt from the guide block assembly 78 positioned on the base 10. Thus, as soon as four belt fasteners have been secured in position another preloaded guide block assembly may be positioned in place on the base 10 and the empty guide block assembly may be removed for loading with rivet assemblies by the second person while the first continues the hammering and riveting operation.Naturally, several guide block assemblies may be mounted on the base at one time and the person doing the off loading of rivet assemblies into the guide block assemblies may load several of them before attaching them to the base and then removing several of the now empty guide block assemblies from the base 10. Another way to achieve a fast operation is to provide a row of guide block assemblies extensive enough to extend across the entire belt width and to have each of them preloaded with rivet assemblies 26. Then, the person hammering can go down the row of block assemblies 78 and continuously hammer without having to stop and shift a block assembly or to load rivet assemblies into a block assembly.The speed and ease of operation in the field under adverse conditions and or where conveyor down time is extremely costly makes most attractive the use of multiple guide block assemblies preloaded with rivet assemblies. The use of the driver 74 and guide block 72 as described above provides clear advantages in that it permits a plurality of rivet assemblies 26 to be driven faster than did prior methods and eliminates safety hazards associated with guiding the rivet assemblies manually. An additional advantage derives from the fact that all of the rivets for a particular fastener are driven simultaneously. In accordance with the present invention, all of the rivet assemblies 26 enter the perforations 20 in the upper fastener plate 32 directly from the bores 70 of the guide block 72 without having an opportunity to stray from their proper paths. From the foregoing it will be appreciated that a novel method and apparatus are provided for on site installation of fasteners on belt ends. The method and apparatus of the present invention enable belt fasteners to be riveted to belt ends more quickly, efficiently, and safely than in the past without substantially increasing the amount of equipment required for the job. While a preferred embodiment has been shown and described herein, there is no intent to limit the invention to any particular embodiment.
