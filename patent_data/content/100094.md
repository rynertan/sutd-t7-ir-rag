# Ultrasonic blood flow imaging method and apparatus.

## Abstract
An ultrasonic blood flow imaging method for two dimen sionally displaying the velocity distribution of a blood flow with in a body to be examined is characterized in that the velocity distribution is displayed as a color picture in which the velocity direction is represented by one color when positive and by an other different color when negative, and the magnitude of the velocity is represented by varying the brightness of the color concerned. An ultrasonic imaging apparatus for carrying out this method comprises an ultrasonic transmitter receiver which outputs a tomographic image signal corresponding to a specific region of an object, and an average velocity signal and a velocity deviation signal corresponding to the velocity of blood flow within the specified region. These signals are stored in respective frame memories and then processed by a color processor to produce a color video signal which is input to a color display for displaying a tomographic image, and the ve locity and velocity deviation of the blood flow.
