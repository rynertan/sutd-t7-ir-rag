# Subsea wellhead protector.

## Abstract
For use with a subsea well incorporating an external condutor pipe 12 extending upwardly above the seabed, a protector apparatus is set forth. A longitudinally split, flange, equipped, bolt joined elongate conductor clamp is supported on a frame 16 at the bottom thereof and has a plurality of appended upstanding braces 70 . The bottom frame is adapted to be rested on a seabed and held in place by a number of anchors 20 driven into the seabed at corners. This apparatus is selectively installed after completion of a well wherein the condutor pipe extends above the bottom, and the apparatus is subsequently removed after protecting the pipe after drilling but before installation of a platform.
