# COPOLYMER LIGHT STABILIZERS HAVING AT LEAST ONE 2,2,6,6 TETRAALKYL PIPERIDYL GROUP AND SYNTHETIC RESIN COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THE SAME

## Abstract
Copolymer light stabilizers are provided having at least one 2,2,6,6, tetraalkyl piperidyl group in the molecule and a molecular weight within the range from about 1000 to about 20,000, that are copolymers of a maleic or fumaric acid ester containing a 2,2,6,6, tetraalkyl piperidyl group in the alcohol group of the formula R₁ O CH CH O R₂ wherein
