# Mechanical feed up of web material on a recoiler.

## Abstract
The slitting head 18 in a sitting line for severing sheet metal web material 28 into strips is utilized to transfer the leading end of the web material from the uncoiler 30 to the recoiler for attachment thereto during the feed up operation. The slitting head 18 is mounted on a swing arm 126 pivoted on a shaft 124. This arrangement enables the operation of setting up the slitting head and recoiler for a new coil of web material to be performed more safely in reduced time and with less effort and manpower.
