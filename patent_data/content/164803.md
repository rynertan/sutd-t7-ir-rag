# High pressure sodium discharge lamp.

## Abstract
In the high pressur sodium discharge lamp accoding to the invention, the electrodes 17 are surrounded by a hollow cylindrical body 15 , which limits an annular space accom modating an electron emitter 19 . The cylindrical body 18 extends against the current conductor 6 supporting the elec trode 17 . Means for screening the electron emitter 19 are provided at the end of the annular space facing the electrode tip 20 . A shield 21 extends from against the electrode tip 20 laterally beyond the hollow cylindrical body 18 .
