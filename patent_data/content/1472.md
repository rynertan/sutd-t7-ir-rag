# Method and apparatus for generating alpha numeric characters for an impact matrix printer.

## Abstract
The printing apparatus disclosed herein and method of the present invention generates alphanumeric characters of high quality, using a multi pin printing head 11 capable of forming discrete dots or pels, by controlling the actuation of the printing head with a timing resolution which is an order of magnitude finer than the nominal dot diameter so that a line smoothness for slanted or curved lines is obtained which is greater than that obtainable by a uniform matrix. The printing head 11 is repeatedly traversed or scanned across the paper to provide essentially parallel lines of scan separated vertically by a distance which is a submultiple of the vertical spacing of the pins so that overlapping dots may be provided in the vertical dimension. By these means the apparatus facilitates the formation of smooth lines of essentially arbitrary slope or curvature.
