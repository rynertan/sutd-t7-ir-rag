# GRIPPER FOR FORMING CLAMPS FOR CONNECTING FLEXIBLE HOSES TO PIPES

## Abstract
A gripper constituted by two discs hinged to each other in order to rotate in parallel planes, each disc being provided with a handle arm, one of said discs being provided on its periphery with two teeth orthogonal to the plane of rotation and separated by a slot, and the other of said discs being provided on its periphery with a tooth which is also orthogonal to the plane of rotation and is configured as an arcuate hook pointing outwards a tooth is hinged to the first arm so that it can be made to withdraw from and approach the two teeth of said arm. The loop of an iron wire wound about the end of a flexible hose is hooked on to the hook, while the ends of the wire are passed through the slot and through the space between the mobile tooth and the tooth adjacent to it. The wire ends are held rigid by moving the mobile tooth against them, and the gripper is then rotated by means of its two arms in order to move the hook away from the point at which the wire ends are held rigid, so tightening the wire about the hose and producing a properly tightened clamp.
