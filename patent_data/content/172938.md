# A PROCESS FOR PREPARING CLAY CONTAINING GELS

## Abstract
The application is concerned with a process for prepar ing clay mineral containing gels with stabilized structure and reversible water adsorption ability, in which a the resistance of medium of aqeous suspension samples of different concentrations containing 1 or more thixotropic, activated, swelling clay mineral s of three layer structure and or swelling chain silicate s , optionally con taining 1 or more known additive s , is measured, thereafter in a series of tests there are added to the suspension sam ples of 1 or more water soluble polymer s capable of react ing with the clay mineral s and or chain silicate s either as such or in an aqeous solution in different proportions, the resistance of medium of the resulting mixtures is measured, and the clay mineral s polymer s water ratios are deter mined at which the resistance of medium of the suspension is at least ten times higher than that of the initial, polymer free suspension, thus obtaining the useful limits, and then b₁ it is carried out the contacting of the clay mineral s and or chain silicate s with the polymer s in a ratio falling within the useful limits, in the presence of an amount of water within the useful limits, or b₂ it is carried out the contacting of the clay mineral s and or chain silicate s with the polymer s in a ratio within or outside the useful limits, in the presence of more water than that corresponding to the useful limits, then the water content of the resulting flocculate is decreased mechanically to fall within the useful limits, and, if neces sary, the clay mineral s polymers ratio of the mass is adjusted simultaneously to fall within the useful limits by adding further amount s of clay mineral s and or chain silicate s and or polymer s to the mass and or optionally 1 or more known additive s is or are, respectively, added to it. Furthermore the application deals with the clay mineral containing gels obtained by this process and their use.
