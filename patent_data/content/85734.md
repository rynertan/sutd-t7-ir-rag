# Drive unit for reciprocating floor conveyor.

## Abstract
Generally horizontally disposed bracing trusses 44, 46 are interconnected between the bottoms of the longitudinal drive beams 70, 72, 74 and the bottoms of the associated transverse drive beams 100, 102, 104 , within a reciprocating floor conveyor. This and other reinforcement particularly adapts the system for use in a stationary installation having a relatively wide floor. Trucks RV equipped with reciprocating floor conveyors are backed into a receiving house H and the conveyors are used for unloading bulk material B from the trucks RV into the receiving house H . The bulk material B is conveyed from the receiving house H up to an elevated inlet 16 at one end of an elongated enclosure E . The enclosure E includes a reciprocating floor conveyor 24 at its bottom and an elevated screw conveyor 36 at its top. The reciprocating conveyor 24 is operated to move bulk mate rial out from the enclosure E at a controlled rate. The elevated screw conveyor 36 is used for rapidly distributing additional bulk material B that is being added at the elevated inlet 16 and the trailing portion of a previous deposit of the bulk material B which has been moved away from the elevated inlet 16 by the reciprocating floor conveyor 24 .
