# METHOD AND ARRANGEMENT FOR PROVIDING INFORMATION TO DEFINE THE VALUES OF A SET OF PARAMETERS WHICH CHARACTERIZE AN ELEMENT

## Abstract
An electrical transducer connected to a computer based system is temperature compensated by providing an assembly including the transducer, which assembly further includes a temperature transducer and a coding element providing a sig nal which is decoded by the computer to specify the zero shifts and sensitivity changes of the transducer at high and low tem perature extremes.
