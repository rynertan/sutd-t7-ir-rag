DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The compounds described above may be prepared by the general methods outlined below. The numerical references in parenthesis following intermediates refer to numbered structural formulas below. The esters and acid addition salts of the compounds of the general formula are prepared in the conventional manner. As acid addition salts can be used the salts derived from a therapeutically acceptable acid such as hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, propionic acid and, more particularly, from a di or polybasic acid such as phosphoric acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, citric acid, glutaric acid, citraconic acid, glutaconic acid, tartaric acid, malic acid, and ascorbic acid.Method I The ss tetralone 1 is condensed with a primary amine in the presence of an acid catalyst such as TsOH.The resulting intermediate is then reduced e.g. withH2 PtO2, NaBH3CN etc. to yield the secondary amine 2 . This is then acylated with propionyl chloride to give the amide 3 . This amide is then reduced to the tertiary amine and the latter is demethylated with HBr orBBr3 depending on the nature of group R1 to yield the phenol or catechol of general structure 4 .EMI8.1 Method II Compound 5 is prepared by known methods such as condensation with propylamine followed by reduction.The intermediate 5 can be converted to compound 6 in two ways A. via acylation with an acid chloride followed by reduction with LiAlH4 or B. via direct alkylation with the appropriate alkyl halide. Compound 4 is prepared from compound 6 by treatment with HBr or BBr3.EMI9.1 Method III Compound 5 is treated with the appropriate carboxylic acid and sodium borohydride to compound 6 in one step. c.f. Hacksell et al., J. Med. Chem. 22, 1469, 1979 . Compound 6 is converted to compound 4 as before i.e. with HBr or BBr3. EMI10.1 The prodrugs of these compounds where the OH group is replaced by an ester, i.e. A isEMI10.2 may be prepared by treating the compound with the desired corresponding acid chloride Horn et al., J. Med. Chem. 25, 993, 1982 . The compounds produced by the methods of this invention may be used in medical treatment, by administration of a therapeutically effective amount of the foregoing compounds. In general the daily dose can be from 0.01 mg. kg. to 100 mg. kg. per day and preferably from 0.1 mg. kg. to 50 mg. kg. per day, bearing in mind, of course, that in selecting the appropriate dosage in any specific case, consideration must be given to the patient s weight, general health, metabolism, age and other factors which influence response to the drug. The compounds produced by the methods of the invention may also be utilized in pharmaceutical compositions in dosage unit form which comprise from about 1 mg. to 100 mg. of a compound of the above formula. The pharmaceutical composition may be in a form suitable for oral use, for example, as tablets, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules emulsions, hard or soft capsules, or syrups or elixirs. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents, flavoring aents, coloring agents and preserving agents in order to provide a pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparation. Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with non toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are suitable for manufacture of tablets.These excipients may be, for example, inert diluents, for example calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate granulating and disintegrating agents, for example maize starch, or alginic acid binding agents, for example starch, gelatine or acacia, and lubricating agents, for example magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. The tablets may. be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatine capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatine capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an oil medium, for example arachis oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil. Aqueous suspensions contain the active compound in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are suspending agents, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia dispersing or wetting agents may be a naturallyoccurring phosphatide, for example lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation product of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate.The said aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives, for example ethyl, or n propyl, p hydroxy benzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose, saccharin, or sodium or calcium cyclamate. Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients, for example, sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents, may also be present.

Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a preservative and flavoring and coloring agents. The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable preparation, for example as a sterile injectable aqueous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3 butanediol. The pharmaceutical compositions may be tableted or otherwise formulated so that for every 100 parts by weight of the composition there are present between 5 and 95 parts by weight of the active ingredient and preferably between 25 and 85 parts by weight of the active ingredient.The dosage unit form will generally contain between about 1 mg. and about 100 mg. of the active ingredient of the formula stated above.

This mixture was refluxed under an atmosphere of nitrogen for 2.5 hr. with continual removal of water Dean Stark method . The toluene was then removed under reduced pressure and the residue was dissolved in a mixture of methanol 4 ml and T.H.F. 60 ml . The pH of this mixture was adjusted to approximately 5 by addition ofHCl ether. Sodium cyanoborohydride 1.16 g was then added and the mixture was stirred under nitrogen gas at room temperature for 2 hr. The solvents were then removed under reduced pressure and the residue was dissolved in ether 50 ml and extracted with water 50 ml . This water layer was re extracted with ether 50 ml .The combined ether fractions were washed with a saturated sodium chloride solution 50 ml and the ether layer was then dried over anhydrous MgSO4. Removal of the ether under reduced pressure yielded 6.96 g of the free base, which was then converted to a HC1 salt 6.11 g, 90 . Recrystallization from ethanol ether produced an analytical sample, m.p. 224 225eC. The HC1 salt 3.40 g of the above secondary amine was dissolved in dichloromethane 40 ml and triethylamine 2.52 g was added. To this stirred solution at room temperature propionyl chloride 1.14 ml was added in a dropwise fashion. During the whole of the above operation the temperature of the solution was kept at 5 C. This mixture was then stirred for a further 30 min. after the completion of the addition of propionyl chloride. The reaction mixture was then filtered and the filtrate was evaporated under reduced pressure. Ether HCl was then added and the resulting precipitated amine hydrochlorides were filtered off and discarded. The ether solution was then reduced to dryness to yield the intermediate amide 2.75 g, 768 . The above amide was dissolved in T.H.F. 25ml and this was added slowly to a mixture of LiAlH4 0.50g in T.H.F. 40 ml under nitrogen gas.

The combined ether fractions were washed with a saturated NaCl solution 50 ml and the ether layer was dried over anhydrous MgSO4.Removal of the ether yielded an oil which on distillation under reduced pressure 0.03 mm Hg 155 160 C gave 9.8 g 67 of the free base. Conversion to a HC 1 salt gave an analytical sample m.p. 201 202 C. The above free base 5.1 g, 17.8 mmol was dissolved in dichloromethane 40 ml containing triethylamine 2.0 g and to this stirred solution at 5 C propionyl chloride 1.85 g, 20.0 mmol was added in a dropwise manner. After the completion of the latter addition the mixture was stirred for a further 30 min. Most of the dichloromethane was then removed under reduced presure and ether HCl was added and the resulting precipitated amine hydrochlorides were filtered off and discarded.The ether solution was then reduced to dryness to yield the intermediate amide 5.9 g . The amide 5.9 g, 17.2 mmol was dissolved in dry T.H.F. 50 ml and this was added slowly to a suspension of LiA1H4 1.0 g, 26.3 mmol in dry T.H.F. 75 ml under an atmosphere of nitrogen.
