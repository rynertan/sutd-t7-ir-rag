# Method and apparatus for vaporising liquid fuels.

## Abstract
In order to increase the evaporation of the fuel compo nent of an air fuel mixture supplied to an internal combus tion engine 1 , the incoming mixture is caused to flow through a matrix 7 presenting a large surface area, prefer ably at least 40 square inches per litre of engine capacity, to the flow. The incoming air or mixture can be pre heated, for example by exhaust gas recirculation 10 or by a heat exchanger through which exhaust heat is transferred indi rectly to the air or mixture. The mixture flow through the matrix itself is, however, most preferably adiabatic. The con struction of the matrix is preferably such as to induce as small as possible a resistance to flow, whilst ensuring that the greatest possible proportion of the liquid fuel droplets present in the mixture is deposited on its surfaces. An array of thin plates disposed parallel to the flow is especially suit able. Heat in the air is transferred to the fuel by direct transfer through the enlarged surface area of the deposited droplets, and indirectly through the structure of the matrix.

## Description
This invention relates to internal combustion engines and in particular to a system for increasing the evaporation of the air fuel mixture for combustion to improve engine performance. It has been know for several years now that if the liquid petrol fed to a multicylinder spark ignition engine is vaporised before entering the intake manifold then significant improvements in engine performance can be obtained.These improvements are the result of two factors. Firstly vaporising the liquid fuel improves mixture homogeneity thereby allowing the engine to operate on leaner mixtures with improved thermal efficiency. Seccndly if the fuel is vaporised immediately on starting the engine then the warm up time during which the engine is on choke is reduced Reducing the time en engine is on choke Is of particular assistance in reducing the exhaust eraissions from the engine but it is also helpful in reducing fuel consumtion. Previous attempts to improve fei evaporation have relied on adding heat to the mixture, usually exhaust gas heat. The difficulties have been to add the heat without cracking the fuel as a result. of local overheating or overheating the charge as n whole. Cracking the fuel leads to a power loss and to the formation of deposits on surfaces In the intake system0 Overheating the entire mixture reduces its density resulting ir a lower mass flowrate of mixture to the engine and hence a reduction in power output. It also increases the susceptibility to denotation knock when the engine is running under high load.An ideal fuel vaporising system is thus one that achieves complete vaporisation of the fuel but adds the minimum amount of heat to the Mixture, An example of a furl vaporiser which uses exhaust ges heat to vaporise the fuel is described in UK Patent No 1530285. As described therein a fuel vaporiser comprises an array of finned tubes disposed across the air fuel intake of an internal combustion petrol engine.Exhaust gas is constrained to flow througt the tubes so that heat from the eihaust gas is transferred to the air fuel mixture to assist in vaporising the fuel element of the mixture For a typical example of a 2 litre engine, a vaporiser of this type would normally have a total surface area of fins and tubes in contaot with the mixture no more than about 70 sq in.This area would normally provide adequate heat transfer, and to increase the area to say 40 sq in per litre or more would normally not be considered necessary, and indeed would be thought undesirable because of the restrictive effect on the flow of mixture into the engine. The inventors appreciate that the addition of large amounts of heat to the air fuel mixture during normal running of a petrol engine is not necessary to ensure full vaporisation of the fuel.However under normal conditions at the exit from the carburettor of a petrol engine only a small proportion of the fi1el has been vaporised. The air temperature at entry to the carburettor is typically 30 to 400C where exhaust heat is employed to heat the incoming air, and the air temperatu e downstream of the carburettor is in general only a few degrees less. It follows that the mixture is far from whermcdyrvumic equilibrium, only a small proportion of the heat in tbe air having bean used to evaporate the fuel.Hence the inventors have appreciated that if a means could be devised by which the remainder of the available heat could be extracted from the air and transferred to the fuel. ie if the air and fuel temperatures could be brought together as quickly as possible, a considerably greater proportion of fuelcouldbe evaporated without the addition of further heat to the mixture According to the present invention, there is provided a system for increasing the evaporation of the fuel component of an air fuel mixture prior to its combustion in an internal combustion engine1 said system comprising an intake passage through which air oan be conveyed into the engine, a fuel metering device for introducing liquid fuel into air within the intake passage to produce an air fuel mixture therein and a matri1 presenting a large external surface area within the intake passage downstream of the fuel metering device. Normally the matrix will not include any heating means. The external surface area of the matrix should desirably be at least sufficient to ensure that substantially all liquid fuel droplets entrained in the air fuel mixture contact and spread out over the surface of the matrix. The external surface area of the matrix will preferably be at least about 40 to 50 square inches per litre capacity of the engine, and desirably will be between 60 and 80 square inches per litre, say about 70 square inches per litre capacity of the engine. The matrix is preferably formed of a material having good thermal conductivity such as copper or aluminium. Conveniently the matrix includes or consists of an array of thin plates extending across the intake passage. The matrix should desirably divide the whole of the flow path for air fuel mixture within the intake passage into narrow flow sections, and preferably the matrix elements should be substantially evenly distributed across the intake passage. Advantageously in some instances there is provided upstream of the matrix means for heating the incoming air or air fuel mixture, especially heating means which is effective mainly or solely during the period of engins warm up and or idling or light load. According to another aspect of the invention, a method of increasing the evaporation of the fuel component of an air fuel mixture prior to its oorilbustion in an internal combustion engine comprises the steps of conveying air into the engine through an intake passage, metering liquid fuel into the air within the intake passage to produce an air fuel mixture therein, and causing the air fuel mixture to flow through a matrix presenting a large external surface area within the intake passage to the air fuel mixture, Normally the flow through the matrix will be adiabatic. The invention will now be described by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawings, of which Figure 1 is a diagrammatic representation of a system in accordance with the invention. Figure 2 is a sectional elevation on the line 11 11 of Figure 1 showing the matrix in greater detail, Figure 3 is a sectionalrplan view on the line III III of Figure 2, Figure k is a sectional view on the line IV IV of Figure 1, Figure 5 is a sectional diagrammatic view of a pre heater for incoming air for use in the system of Figures 1 to 4, and Figure 6 is a sectional view on the line VI VI of Figure 5. As shown in Figure 1 an engine 1 is provided with an intake manifold 2 and an exhaust manifold 3. The intake manifold 2 and exhaust manifold 3 are formed as a single casting to create a conventional exhaust heated hot spot. Air is drawn into the engine through an intake passage passing through a conventional air filter 4, a conventional carburettor 5, an exhaust gas reoirculation flange 6, a matrix 7, a tapered flange 8, and the intake manifold 2, all of which are connected in series. The exhaust gas recirculation flange 6 is provided with an orifice 9 Figure 4 through which exhaust gas can be ingested into the intake passage. A recirculationduct 10 is provided by which exhaust gas can be oonveyed from the exhaust manifold 3 to the orifice 9. The orifice 9 is positioned just downstream of a variable throttle not shown of the carburettor 5 and is of a limited crosssectional area. When the pressure in the intake passage in the region of the flange 8 falls to a low level, as when the engine is idling with the throttle closed, the mass flow rate of exhaust gas through the orifice 9 is limited by the gas rsaching sonic velocity therein. Several such orifices 9 may be provided around the circumference of the flange 6, if desired.Means not shown may be provided for closing off the orifice 9 when the engine is sufficiently warmed up.Such means may be controlled eg by means of an appropriately positioned temperature sensor positioned in the engine block or in tbe flow path of the engine coolant. The matrix 7 comprises an array of thin copper plates 11 disposed parallel to the flow direction of the air fuel mixture. The plates 11 each extend right across the intake passage and serve to divide the flow path into a number of narrow channels. The plates 11 are supported on a number of rods or tubes 12 of rectangular section, each disposed with its long sides parallel to the flow direction so as to create the minimum resistance to the flow. If the plates 11 can be made self supporting, the tubes are best dispensed with. The matrix 7 is designed to provide the minimum impedence to the flow, but has a surface area substantially greater than, for example heat exchangers which have previously been proposed for heating the air fuel mixture in an intake passageThe matrix 11 is not provided with any heating means, and the flow of air fuel mixture therethrough is substantially adiabatic there may be some slight incidental heat exo,hangs to the atmosphere through the walls of the matrix .The external surface area of the matrix which is contacted by the air fuel mixture ari the configuration and shape Oi the plates 11 is such that substantially all fuel droplets entrained in the mixture contact the matrix surface, and wet it and spread out thereon The fuel droplets are thus brought substantially to rest relative to the flow through the intake passage, and are spread out so as to present a much increased surface area to the flow. Both of these factors greatly enhance the evaporation rate of the liquid droplets. Evaporation is further enhanced if the plates ii are of a good thermally conducting material, because this facilitates transfer of heat from the air to the droplets through the plate material. The tapered flange 8 has merely The function of tilting the intake passage slightly upwards, as in conventional good practice, In uses when the engine 1 is started from cold, air is drawn in through the air filter 4 and fuel is metered in through the carburettor 5 Hot exhaust gas is almost immediately available for ingestion through duct 10 and orifice 9, untIl the engine is warmed up. During warm up at idling, the flow rate of ingested exhaust gas is limited by its reaching sonic velocity in the orifice 9. The air fuel mixture then passes through the matrix 7. In one practical system it has been found that at least 65 of the fuel in the mixture is vaporised by the time the mixture reaches the intake manifold 2. In the case of a comparable engine without the matrix 7, it is found that only 25 of the fuel is vaporized.This is achieved without the addition of heat in the matrix, the effectiveness resulting from the matrix promoting the transfer of heat from the air to the fuel in the mixture, until a point is approached where air and fuel are in thermodynamic equilibrium, ie the mixture temperature has dropped and the vapour density has risen close to saturation, At this stage the Liquid droplets remaining in the mixture will tend to be the less volatile fuel constituents. These are most effectively evaporated by the provision of the conventional exhaust heated hot spot, preferably located in the manifold downstream of the matrix and positioned nonnal to the general direction of flow to impact the fuel droplets directly on the hot surface. By way of specific example the following data is given for a system as just described installed in a typical 2 litre engine. Matrix No of fins 20 Total surface area of fins 0.129 mê Each fin 57.2 mm square Height of fin array 44.5 mm Fins spaced evenly Exhaust Gas Recirculation Diameter of orifice 9 0.168 inch With such a system, 15 of exhaust gas was recirculated following a cold start at 1000 rpm, resulting in a heating rate of 150 watts. The provision of the matrix enabled this heat to be utilised to the maximum, resulting in a predicted increase of 25 in evaporation rate. The system described above achieved almost total utilisation of the available heat in the air fuel mixture for a loss in maximum engine power of the engine of no more than 5 , which is regarded as acceptable in return for the advantage obtained. After warm up the exhaust gas recirculation circuit was automatically closed by means of a thermostatically controlled valve. Such a valve can conveniently be made responsive, for example, to coolant temperature, or the temperature of the engine block, or to the temperature of air in the intake passage. However, if desired this or another means of heating could with advantage be employed under other or all engine operating conditions. If the heat iE added upstream of the matrix the matrix greatly increases f he utilisation of the added heat to evaporate the fuel droplets and the mixture temperature thus remains relatively low. The addition of controlled amounts of heat without undue reduction in the density of the mixture ard consequent drastic power loss is Xhas made possible. Although heat could be added through the matrix structure, this is not normally desirable. One particularly advantageous pre heater device for heating the incoming air is shown diagrammatically in Figures 5 and 6. As shcwn therein the lower portion of the exhaust pipe 3 is provided with a heat exchanger comprising a jacket 13 enclosing a length of the exhaust pipe 3. Intake air can be admitted to the space between the jacket and the exhaust by an inlet 14 aud can leave the space by way of an outlet 15. In order to improve the heat transfer rate between the exhaust gas and the air, a zig zag arrangement of fins 16 is attached to the outside of the exhaust pipe 3 within the jacket 13, and a cruciform arrangement of fins 1 is attached within the heat exchanger section of the exhaust pipe.For the purpose of illustration, in Figure 5 the structure is shown with part of the jacket 13 removed so as to reveal the arrange nent of fins 16. As seen therein, for purposes of manufacturing convenience, the fins 16 are arranged as six similar annular sections, spaced in two groups of three along straight portions of the exhaust pipe. Hot air leaving by the outlet 15 is mixed with ambient air taken in through an inlet 18i in a mixing device 19 which would normally be located in the housing of the air filter ka The balance of the hot and ambient air flows is controlled by the device 19, which could be a conventional thermostatic air valve employing a bimetallic element to sense temperature and actuate the control mechanism. Aditionally a signal provided via a line 20 could be used to allow cooler air to pass to the engine under conditions of high load or speed, when the throttle opening is wide. The line 20 can for example be a pneumatic line connected to transmit the manifold vacuum downstream of the carburettor 5, or an electrical line carrying an analogue signal representative of the throttle position. The output from the device 19 is provided an outlet 21 to the inlet of the filter 4. Tn use, there will be an appreciable time delay following a cold start before the air reaching the outlet 21 achieves the desired temperature to effect as full as pcssible vaporisation of the fuel. At this stage, however, exhaust gas recirculated through pipe 10 provides an almost instantaneous sourse of heat by which fuel in the mixture can be vapourised. Once the engine reaches a predetermined running temperature, the flow or recirculated exhaust gas is halted, but the incoming air continues to be heated to a degree dependent upon tiLe engine load, the lighter the engine and the lower its speed load, the greater the temperature of the incoming air. At all times, the matrix 7 ensures that as much of the available heat as possible is utilised to ensure vaporisation of the fuel in the mixture. Numerous variations of the embodiment described are possible without departing from the scope of the invention. Thus, for example, various methods of fuel metering are possible in place of the carburettor 5, for example fuel injectors or spraying devices. Also, although the invention has been specifically described in its application to a nonbcross flow engine, it can be applied, possibly with even greater advantage, to a cross flow engine in which the difficulty of supplying rapid heat by conventional warm up devices is greater, due to the remote location of the exhaust.
