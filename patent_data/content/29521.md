# Apparatus and method for assembling a heat exchanger core.

## Abstract
An apparatus for assembling cooling tubes and fin elements in the manufacture of heat exchangers, comprises stations 17 , 18 for feeding the tubes 15 and the fin elements 16 to grooves 14 in a rotatable drum 11 , and are then ejected together at an ejecting station by an expelling device 21 . An advancing means 27,28 advances the tube and the fin element along a transportation path. The tubes and the fin elements are soldered during their passage through a soldering station 36 . The expelling device 21 initially operates at a fast speed to eject the tubes and fins and then operates at a second slower speed to advance, in cooperation with the advancing means, the tubes and fins along the transportation path.
