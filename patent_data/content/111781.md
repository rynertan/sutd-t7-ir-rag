## Description
CONTROLLER FOR A TURBOCHARGER ARRANGEMENT The present invention relates to a controller for a turbocharger arrangement. Turbocharginy is normally thought of only as a means for increasing horsepower or decreasing full load specific fuel consumption. In the evolution of engines presently utilizing turbochargers, such as large heavy duty diesel engines, aircraft engines, racing engines and the like, this understanding has been adequate in that in the end application these engines are operated at or near full load for a large portion of the duty cycle. However, most applications do not require that the engine operate at or near full load for extended periods of time.In fact, in most applications, the engine generally is operated below 50 power and in many applications the engine operates well below 20 power during most of its operation. Examples of these applications are engines used in automobiles, light and medium trucks, generator sets, compressors, tractors, construction equipment and the like. Engines operating at these low power settings are very inefficient. In a diesel engine, this inefficiency is a result of thermal efficiency decay as combustion temperature decreases and because the internal friction remains relatively constant regardless of load. In a yasoline engine, this inefficiency results from pumping loop loss increases with decreasiny load and because the internal engine friction remains relatively constant regardless of load. Thus, by utiliziny a smaller effective engine size, that is, an engine having a smaller displacement rate the product of 1 2 displacement times engine speed for a four cycle engine by either a reduction in displacement, a reduction in operating speed or a combination of both, the part load fuel consumption may be improved. In gasoline engines, this improvement results from reduced engine friction and reduced pumping loop losses. In diesel engines, this improvement is a result of reduced engine friction and a higher thermal efficiency due to higher combustion temperatures. The present day turbochargers have failed to efficiently control the flow of motive gases through the turbine. Presently, there are basically two methods used for controlling power output of the turbine. The first of these methods is by careful sizing of the turbine and turbine nozzle area so that at maximum engine operating speed and load the desired boost pressure will not be exceeded. The disadvantage of this method is that at low engine speeds the available boost pressure is limited and the response to demand is slow. The second method used for controlling the pressure through the turbine is the use of a wastegate in conjunction with a turbine nozzle sized to produce excessive turbine at maximum engine speed and load. In this method, when the predetermined boost pressure is reached, the wastegate opens and bypasses a portion of the exhaust gases.While this method increases the available boost at the lower engine speeds and provides improvements in response, it is quite inefficient in that the bypassed, high pressure exhaust gas is simply wasted at the expense of increased engine back pressure. Additionally, at part load, when the turbocharger is essentially inoperative, the small nozzle area acts as a restriction to the exhaust and causes an increase in the pumping loop loss. In many applications, turbocharging may be used to permit the use of engines having smaller, effective engine size. By turbocharging, it is relatively easy to obtain twice the naturally aspirated power per cubic inch of displacement and in some cases three times the power. However, attempts to turbocharge smaller engines have generally been unsuccessful. This failure can generally be attributed to the present design of turbochargers which are built around a journal bearing and a flat disc type thrust bearing. This type bearing system requires from one to three horsepower depending upon the particular turbocharger and the speed required in the application just to overcome friction.While this loss may be insignificant in applications where turbines are required to develop in excess of thirty horsepower for the compression process typically engines of 200 or more horsepower , it becomes very significant when turbocharging engines having less than 100 horsepower. For example, where the turbocharger turbine power is 60 80 horsepower, a bearing friction loss of 2 3 horsepower is insignificant. However, in a smaller turbocharger where the turbine power is only 15 horsepower, a bearing friction loss of 2 3 horsepower, or more likely 4 5 horsepower due to the higher rpm at which the smaller turbochargers are operated, represents almost a third of the total turbine horsepower produced and is completely unacceptable. The presently used bearing systems also require considerable radial and axial clearances to provide for oil flow and rotor stability. These clearances are translated into a relatively large clearance over the blading of the compressor and turbine rotors thereby affecting the efficiency of both the compressor and turbine. For example, the journal and disc thrust bearings, commonly used in present day turbochargers, may require a clearance of 0.015 inches between the turbine and compressor blades and the surround structure. Where the blade height is 1 inch, the clearance to blade height ratio is only 11 2 percent. However, where a smaller turbocharger is desired, having blade heights of, for example, 0.2 inches, a clearance of 0.015 inches between the blades and surround structure amounts to 7 1 2 percent of the blade height.Therefore, where a 0.015 inch clearance is acceptable in larger turbocharger applications, it is completely unacceptable when smaller turbocharyers are being designed. Therefore, in smaller turbochargers, this clearance becomes more and more critical to the overall performance of the turbocharger and ultimately to the performance of the engine. The bearing systems now being used in turbochargers are lubricated with engine oil, although most bearing failures are the result of contaminated engine oil or lack of engine oil pressure during starts. Where high speed journal bearings are used in a conventional turbocharger, continuous oil flow is inherently required to provide shaft stability as well as to carry away heat generated by viscous friction. Oil flow iS also required to carry away the heat transferred into the bearing system from the adjacent turbine which operates at temperatures as high as 1600 degreesF . Even if antifriction ball bearings were substituted for the journal bearings in conventional turbochargers, a continuous oil flow would be required to carry away heat transferred from the turbine. Thus, while lubrication is a necessity for the proper operation of present day turbochargers, lubrication also accounts for many of the failures.Further, continuous oil flow lubrication requires substantial plumbing and associated structure for providing the lubricant to the bearings. Therefore, a need has arisen for a turbocharger which can be efficiently operated to turbocharge both small and large internal combustion engines. The need is further for a turbocharger having a bearing system which eliminates the problems heretofore experienced by continuous engine oil lubricated bearings and makes the most efficient use of the motive gases for driving the turbocharger turbine. Further, the bearing assemblies supporting the rotation of the compressor and turbine must facilitate the reduction of the required compressor and turbine rotor clearances. The present invention provides an improved turbocharger for use with internal combustion engines which overcomes many of the disadvantages heretofore experienced by prior art turbochargers. In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the turbocharger includes a compressor for supplying air to an engine and a turbine for receiving driving exhaust gas from the engine. The turbine has a shaft integrally attached therewith with which the turbine rotates, and the compressor is fitted on the turbine shaft for rotation with the turbine. The shaft is rotatively supported by bearing assemblies such that the compressor and turbine are overhung to one side of the bearing assemblies with the turbine separated from the bearing assemblies by the compressor.As a result of this arrangement, the bearing assemblies are removed from the turbine and the intense heat td which the turbine is subjected. In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, antifriction ball bearing assemblies are used for supporting the compressor and turbine shaft. The use of ball bearings is particularly critical in providing better control over the radial and axial movement of the turbine and compressor.This additional control over the movement of the rotating assembly allows reduced blade tip clearances, thereby appreciably improving compressor and turbine efficiency. The use of antifriction ball bearings further reduces the turbine work required, thereby improving the specific fuel consumption of the engine In one embodiment of the present invention, the bearing assemblies include a first and second inner raceway formed in the compressor and turbine shaft.A fixed outer raceway corresponding to the first inner raceway is attached to the turbocharger housing and a plurality of balls are received between the fixed outer raceway and the first inner raceway. A second outer raceway riny is provided and is slidable relative to the first outer raceway. This second outer raceway ring is slidable relative to the housing and a compression spring acts between the turbocharger housing and the ring to bias the ring away from the first outer raceway and in engagement with balls positioned between the ring and the second inner raceway. Simultaneously therewith, the first outer raceway, attached to the turbocharger housing, is engaged against the balls between such raceway and the first inner raceway on the turbine and compressor shaft. In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, a turbocharger includes a variable area turbine nozzle having a plurality of nozzle vanes spaced circumferentially about the turbine and in the inlet through which exhaust gas from the engine is received into the turbine. A control linkage system is positioned intermediate of the compressor and turbine and controls the position of the nozzle vanes to vary the flow velocity of exhaust gases into the turbine. In one embodiment of the invention, the variable area turbine nozzle control linkage system includes a control ring having an outer ring movable angularly relative to an inner ring. An actuation lever is rotatable with each vane and has one end engaged in the outer ring of the control ring.A control rod is attached to one of the actuation levers and structure is provided for selectively moving the control rod to pivot the actuation lever attached thereto. This in turn rotates the outer ring of the control ring thereby pivoting each of the actuation levers and the vanes attached thereto. The use of variable area turbine nozzles provides more efficient control of peak boost pressure while allowing greater boost at lower engine speeds than now attainable. Variable area nozzles also improve transient response and provide a better part load specific fuel consumption in that the nozzle area can be opened to minimize engine back pressure during part load operation. Further, nozzles can be positioned to optimize emissions.Moreover, the present invention provides a very straightforward arrangement for conveniently controlling a plurality of nozzle vanes circumferentially spaced in the turbine inlet. The control linkage is conveniently positioned in the unused space intermediate of the compressor and turbine and in addition to providing for a very compact turbocharger package , the control linkage space further provides an insulation shield between the heat of the turbine area and the bearing assembly supporting the compressor and turbine shaft. It has been found that this inlet structure substantially eliminates the surge area normally encountered by conventional turbochargers at low compressor flows and allows the turbocharger to continue to function at low compressor flows and corresponding low engine speeds without producing unstable flow at low operating speeds. In accordance with still another embodiment of the invention, the turbocharger further includes control structure for varying the velocity of exhaust air to the turbine rotor in response to the speed of the rotor shaft to maintain the compressor rotor speed at any desired level at various engine conditions. A plurality of nozzle vanes are spaced around the turbine rotor and in the inlet through which exhaust air from the engine is received to the turbine rotor. Control structure is provided for rotating the nozzle vanes to vary the flow of exhaust air to the turbine rotor.A shaft speed monitor operates to control the position of the nozzle vanes in accordance with the speed of the shaft such that the nozzle vanes are moved to reduce the inlet area to the turbine rotor when the shaft speed drops below a predetermined level and to increase the inlet area to the turbine rotor when the speed of said shaft increases above a predetermined value. In this way, the speed of the turbine and the compressor driven by the turbine is controlled as desired without regard to the engine speed. In accordance7with still another embodiment of the invention, an axial compressor is mounted on the compressor rotor and turbine rotor shaft in the turbine compressor air inlet upstream of the radial compressor. The axial compressor operates to compress air passing into the air inlet prior to introduction of the air to the radial compressor.The radial compressor and turbine rotors are overhung to one side of the shaft bearing support structure and the axial compressor rotor is mounted on the shaft on the side of the bearing support structure opposite the radial compressor and turbine. In accordance with still another embodiment of the invention, an armature is mounted for rotation with the shaft and a field winding is mounted in the turbocharger housing adjacent the armature such that an electric current is produced by the rotation of the armature with the shaft within the field winding. In accordance with a more specific.embodiment of the invention, wherein the shaft is supported for rotation in a bearing housing supported from the compressor and turbine rotor housing, the field winding is mounted in the bearing housing. In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the turbocharger described above is mounted to an internal combustion engine with the turbine and compressor axis of rotation in a vertical orientation. When mounted to a V engine, the turbocharyer is nested between the cylinder banks with the engine exhaust ported directly from the cylinders to the turbocharger to drive the turbine rotor. In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, the basic structure of the turbocharger may be modified to operate as a turbojet. In this embodinent, the turbojet includes a shaft, having a turbine rotor and first compressor rotor mounted on the shaft. Bearing structure is provided for rotatively supporting the shaft within a housing such that the compressor and turbine rotors are overhung to one side of the bearing structure with the bearing structure on the side of the compressor rotor opposite the turbine rotor. An air flow channel is formed within the housing for directiny air to the compressor rotor and thereafter to the turbine rotor. Structure is provided for introducing fuel within the air flow channel to form an air fuel mixture within the air flow channel.An ignitor is provided within the air flow channel intermediate of the compressor rotor and turbine rotor for igniting the air fuel mixture to drive the turbine and provide thrust from the turbojet. In accordance with a more specific embodiment of the invention, the turbine rotor and compressor rotor shaft has an axial bore formed therein. Ports communicate between the axial bore and the shaft and through the compressor rotor to the air flow channel providing for the fuel from the axial bore in the shaft to move from the bore to the air flow channel. Fuel is supplied to the bore of the shaft and is directed by centrifugal force during the rotation of the compressor rotor from the bore in the shaft through the compressor rotor to the air flow channel thereby eliminating the need for a fuel pump. In accordance with still a further embodiment of the invention, an axial compressor is mounted on the shaft upstream of the first compressor rotor for compressing air moving into the air flow channel.The axial compressor rotor is mounted on the side of the bearing structure opposite the first compressor rotor. This structure provides a higher cycle pressure ratio while maintaining lower centrifugal stresses. Alternatively, where compressor rotor stresses are not critical, a much higher cycle pressure ratio may be achieved. In accordance with still a further embodiment of the invention, an armature is mounted on the shaft within the air flow channel and on the side of the bearing structure opposite the first compressor rotor. A field winding is mounted in the housing adjacent the armature, whereby electric current is produced when the armature rotates relative to the field winding. Use of rare earth metals such as selenium clt would permit current generation at the high rotative speeds. In accordance with still a further embodiment of the invention, a turbofan is provided including a turbine rotor and first compressor rotor mounted on a shaft for rotation thereon. The shaft is supported by bearing structure mounted within a housing such that the compressor and turbine rotors are overhung to one side of the bearing structure. An axial compressor having an axial compressor rotor is mounted on the shaft on the side of the bearing structure opposite the first compressor rotor. A primary air flow channel is formed within the housing for directing air to the axial compressor, then to the first compressor rotor and thereafter to the turbine rotor.A fuel system introduces fuel within the air flow channel to form a fuel air mixture within the primary air flow channel and an ignition source is positioned within the air flow channel intermediate of the compressor and turbine rotors to ignite the air fuel mixture. A bypass channel is also formed within the housing to channel a portion of the inlet air subsequent to compression by the axial compressor through a second nozzle. The axial compressor rotor is adapted with an armature which cooperates with a stationary field winding to produce electric current. For a more complete understanding of the present invention, and for further details and advantages thereof, reference is now made to the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which FIGURE 1 is a perspective view of the turbocharger of the present invention FIGURE 2 is a vertical section taken along lines 2 2 of the turbocharger illustrated in FIGURE 1 FIGURE 3 is an enlarged view of the bearing assemblies supporting the compressor and turbine shaft of the present invention FIGURE 4 is an enlarged section view taken along line 4 4 of FIGURE 2 with the compressor backwall removed for clarity FIGURE 5 is a partially broken away end view as viewed from line 5 5 of FIGURE 2 looking in the direction of the arrows FIGURE 5a is a section view taken along line 5a5a of FIGURE 5 looking in the direction of the arrows FIGURE 6 is a partially broken away end view of the turbocharger of the present invention with an alternative method of controlling the turbine inlet vanes FIGURE 6a is a block diagram further illustrating the control unit illustration in FIGURE 6 FIGURE 7 is a vertical section taken along line 7 7 of FIGURE 6. FIGURE 1 is a perspective view of a turbocharger 20 embodying the present invention. The turbocharger includes an outer structure 22 consisting of a compressor housing unit 24 coupled to a turbine housing unit 26 by a V clamp band 28. Referring to FIGURES 1 and 2, compressor housing unit 24 includes a tubular inlet port 40 with a transverse wall 42 attached to one end of port 40 and extending outwardly therefrom. A circumferential chamber 44 is attached from wall 42. Inlet port 40 defines a compressor air inlet 50 and circumferential chamber 44 defines a compressor exhaust 52. Turbine housing 26 defines a turbine air inlet 54 and a turbine exhaust 56. In operation of the turbocharger, air is drawn into inlet 50 and compressed air is discharyed from exhaust 52 to an internal combustion engine to which the turbocharyer is mounted. Exhaust air from the engine is channeled into turbine air inlet 54 to drive the turbocharger turbine and is exhausted through turbine exhaust 56. Referring still to FIGURES 1 and 2, a bearing support cylinder 60 is mounted within inlet port 40 by a plurality of vanes 62 extending from the inside wall surface 64 of inlet port 40. A cap 66 is mounted over the end of support cylinder 60. A piston type actuator 80 is mounted by bracket 82 FIGURE 1 to turbine housing 26. Actuator 80 includes a controller 84 operated to extend and retract control rod 86 as will be discussed hereinafter in greater detail. Air lines 88 and 89 provide air to controller 84 as necessary to operate rod 86. An oil reservoir cover plate 90 is attached to compressor housing unit 24 by a plurality of screws 92. Referring specifically to FIGURE 2, a compressbr backwall 100 and a turbine backwall 102 are positioned intermediate of compressor housing unit 24 and turbine housing unit 26 when these two units are assembled. These four components are piloted one to another and held in assembly by V clamp 28. As can be appreciated from a close review of FIGURE 2 only a single V clamp is required td hold the entire assembly together. As previously described, compressor housing unit 24 includes a tubular inlet port 40 with a transverse wall 42 attached to one end thereof to one of the inlet ports and extending outwardly therefrom.A circumferential chamber 44 is attached to the end of wall 42 remote from inlet port A0 and has a varying area around its circumference increasing to the discharge provided by compressor exhaust 52 FIGURE 1 . Inlet port 40 has a first inside wall portion 110 having a converging diameter toward wall 42 and a second inside wall portion 112 joined to first inside wall portion 110 by a step 114. The second inside wall portion 112 has a diverging diameter toward wall 42. Wall 42 has a plurality of circumferentially spaced apertures 116 therethrough. Chamber 44 has an opening 118 substantially in the plane of wall 42 in addition to compressor exhaust 52. A forward compressor wall insert 126 includes a tubular throat 128 and a circular disc 130 attached transversely from one end of throat 128. Throat 128 has an inside wall surface 131 having a diameter converging toward disc 130 and an outer surface 132 having a diameter diverging toward disc 130. The diveryiny diameter surface 132 corresponds to the dlverginy surface of inside wall portion 112 of inlet port 40 such that throat 128 may be inserted within and mated with inlet port 40. The converging diameter inside wall surface 131 of throat 128 corresponds to the extension of converging diameter of first inside wall portion 110 of inlet port 40.When insert 126 is mated into inlet port 40, a continuous converging diameter is provided from the inlet of port 40 inwardly intothe turbocharger. A plurality of rivet like protrusions 140 extend from disc 130 and correspond to apertures 116 in wall 42. With the insert engaged to compressor housing 24 with the end of throat 128 engaging step 114 of inlet port 40, protrusions 140 are engaged through apertures 116 with disc 130 abuttiny the corresponding surface of wall 42. As is shown inFIGURE 2, protrusions 140 have been inserted into apertures 116 and the heads thereof deformed to attach insert 126 to housing 24. Disc 130 extends beyond wall 42 to partially cover opening 118 of chamber 44. A circumferential gap 146 is formed between the outer tip of disc 130 and the wall of chamber 44, and a diffuser area 148 is formed between disc 130 and compressor backwall 100 between centrifugal flow compressor rotor 172 and gap 146 leading to chamber 44. Referring still to FIGURE 2, bearing support cylinder 60 is supported concentrically within inlet port 40 by a plurality of vanes 62 extending inwardly from wall surface 64 of port 40. Turbocharger 20 further includes a shaft 160 supported for rotation in bearing support cylinder 60 by two ball bearing assemblies 162 and 164. A radial flow turbine rotor 170 is mounted at one end of shaft 160 and a centrifugal flow compressor rotor 172 is mounted intermediate of turbine rotor 170 and bearing assemblies 162 and 164. Shaft 160 passes through aperture 176 in compressor backwall 100 and labyrinth seal 174 in turbine backwall 102. Turbine rotor 170 is fixedly attached to shaft 160, such as by welding, and compressor rotor 172 is retained in position on shaft 160 by retainer nut 180. Compressor rotor 172 is drilled to receive shaft 160 and counterbored to form a bore 182. Bore 182 has a diameter larger than the outer diameter of retainer nut 180 such that retainer nut 180 maybe pressed onto shaft 160 into engagement with the botom wall 184 of bore 182 to retain the compressor rotor in position on shaft 160. A compressor rotor shim 186 is positioned between compressor rotor 172 and a step 188 in shaft 160 to accurately position the compressor rotor in the axial direction. Referring to FIGURES 2 and 3, a ring 200 is fitted within the end of cylinder 60 adjacent compressor rotor 172 and is prevented from moving into cylinder 60 by a retaining ring 202 attached to cylinder 60. Outer raceway 204 of bearing assembly 164 is formed in ring 200, the inner raceway 206 being integrally formed in shaft 160. Balls 208 are engaged between the inner and outer raceways to form bearing assembly 164. Bearing assembly 162 includes inner raceway 210 formed integrally in shaft 160 and an outer ring 212 slidable within cylinder 60 with an outer raceway 214 formed therein for receiving balls 216. A compression spring 218 is engaged between riny 212 and a retaining ring 220 fixed within cylinder 60 and biases ring 212 outwardly to fix the position of balls 216 and 208 in bearing assemblies 162 and. 164, respectively, thereby fixing the position of shaft 160. As is shown in FIGURES 2 and 3, outer raceway 204 is formed in ring 200 with the ball radius on only one side. Thus, the assembly of bearing assembly 164 is made by positioning a full complement of balls 208 in raceway 206, and engaging ring 200 therearound. Similarly, outer raceway 214 is formed in ring 212 with the ball radius on only one side. Balls 216 of bearing assembly 162 are assembled by moving outer ring 212 to compress spring 218 and inserting a full complement of balls 216 in raceway 214 of shaft 160. By releasing ring 212, spring 218 automatically forces the ring into engagement with balls 216 to form bearing assembly 162 while simultaneously engaging ring 200 against balls 208 of bearing assembly 164. Alternatively, less than a full complement of balls 208 and 216 may be used in bearing assemblies 162 and 164 by the use of an appropriate retainer.Depending upon the application, an oil impregnated retainer or a sacrificial retainer which replenishes a self lubricating coating to the balls may be used. The mounting of shaft 160 within cylinder 60 is completed by the engagement of cap 66 on the end of cylinder 60 to close the opening in cylinder 60 remote from compressor rotor 172. The use in the present bearing system of the ball bearing arrangement employing integral inner raceways permits a larger diameter shaft and thus provides a very stiff shaft. Additionally, this bearing arrangement provides a very tight bearing system permitting very little radial or axial movement. As a result, the present bearing system substantially reduces the clearance required between the compressor and turbine and surrounding housing, and concentricity problems are minimized. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, bearing assemblies 162 and 164 are starved of oil. The only lubrication provided to the bearing assemblies is through wicks 222 and 224 which transfer oil from a reservoir R by capillary action to ramps or slingers 226. Oil supplied to slingers 226 is projected by centrifugal force to bearing assemblies 162 and 164 during rotation of shaft 160. In this way, the use of engine oil as a lubricant for the turbocharger bearings, and the associated plumbing and seals are eliminated.Moreover, the failures resulting from the use of contaminated engine oil as a lubricant or the lack of engine oil during starts is avoided. Moreover, no oil seals are required and bearing failure resulting from the failure of seals is also eliminated. Alternatively, the bearing assemblies may be permanently lubricated with a heavy consistency oil or grease which is packed into the raceways and around the balls of the bearing assemblies. As another alternative, an oil impregnated phenolic retainer may be used to provide lubricant to the balls for a considerable period. In either of these cases, the need for wicks 222 and 224 and slingers 226 would be eliminated although with a reduced bearing life. In conventional turbochargers where journal bearings and disc type thrust bearings are employed, continuous lubrication of the bearings is requried.Additionally, because the turbine is subjected to temperatures up to 16000 F, where the bearings are adjacent the turbocharyer turbine, continuous lubrication is required to sufficiently cool the bearings to prevent failure through overheating.Even ball bearings would require a continuous flow of oil for cooling. The ability of the present system to successfully function without conventional flood lubrication used toboth lubricate and cool the bearings is the result of the particular arrangement of the type of bearings used in the present invention and the relative location of the bearings to the compressor and turbine. As will be described hereinafter in greater detail, because the present invention eliminates the need for a continuous flow of oil for bearing lubrication and cooling , the present turbocharger may be mounted at any desired orientation. In contrast, conventional turbochargers have been severely limited as to their possible orientation. In the present invention, the journal and disc bearings of conventional turbochargers are replaced by the more precise ball type bearing assemblies, thereby eliminatiny the need for a continuous flow of lubrication for the bearings. Additionally, both the compressor and the turbine of the present turbocharyer are overhung to one side of the bearing assemblies, and the turbine is maximally removed from the bearing assemblies with the compressor positioned between the bearing assemblies and the turbine. As this arrangement provides sufficient thermal insulation between the turbine and the bearing assemblies, the bearings will not be sufficiently heated as to require conventional lubrication methods. The back to back compressor turbine arrangement of the present invention not only reduces substanstantially the heat conducted to the bearing assemblies but also minimizes the thermal expansion effects, thereby lowering the blade tip clearances required. This arrangement further eliminates the conventional bearing housing and provides a more compact package than present straddle mounted rotors having the support bearings intermediate of the compressor and turbine. Additionally, the use of antifriction ball bearing assemblies 162 and 164 provides much better control over the radial and axial movement of the compressor and turbine, thereby allowing reduced blade tip clearance. This in turn appreciably improves the compressor and turbine efficiency.Compred to journal bearings, the use of the antifriction ball bearing assemblies 162 and 164 also reduces the turbine work required to drive the bearings. This in turin reduces the engine back pressure resulting in the improvement of the specific fuel consumption as well as enhancing the ability to accelerate the rotor. The present invention is also directed to a nozzle area control structure 228 for selectively varying the turbine nozzle area to control the speed or pressure output of the turbocharger. Referring toFIGURES 1 and 2, exhaust gas from the internal combustion engine on which the turbocharger is mounted is injected into the turbocharyer through turbine air inlet 54 and channeled against the blades of turbine rotor 170 through a nozzle area 230 formed by turbine backwall 102, a wall 232 parallel thereto and the nozzle vanes 234. This nozzle area is controlled by structure 228 including a plurality of movable nozzle vanes 234 positioned circumferentially about the nozzle area and rotatable to vary flow velocity and angle of exhaust gas to turbine rotor 170.Referring to FIGURES 2 and 4, vanes 234 include trunnions 236 and 238 extending from opposite sides thereof. Trunnion 236 extends through turbine backwall 102 and is attached to actuation lever 240. Trunnion 238 extends into wall 232. A nipple 242 is formed on one end of each actuation lever. These nipples extend into radial slots 244 formed in a control ring 246. Control riny 246 and actuation levers 240 are situated in air space gap 247 intermediate of compressor rotor 172 and turbine rotor 170. Control ring 246 is concentrically positioned about the axis of shaft 160 and is received on a cylindrical surface 248 extending from compressor backwall 100. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, control ring 246 includes an inner ring 250 and an outer ring 252 formed with an inner and outer raceway, respectively, for receiving a plurality of balls 254 therebetween. Inner ring 250 is fixedly attached to the cylindrical surface 248 extending from compressor backwall 100, and outer ring 252 rotates angularly relative to the inner riny.Referring to FIGURE 4, it is seen that by the rotation of ou ter ring 252, each of the actuation levers 240 is rotated about the axes of trunnions 236 and 238, resulting in the simultaneous rotation of each nozzLe vane 234. As is shown in FIGURES 4 and 5, one of the actuation levers 240 is provided with an extension 262. Control rod 86 is attached to the end of extension 262 remote from nipple 242. Control rod 86 includes a threaded eye bolt 86a attached to the extension 262 by an axis pin. The opposite end of eye bolt 86a is threadedly received within control rod 86 and is adjustable therein to allow for. the readjustment of nozzle vanes 234 about their rotational axes. By the movement of control rod 86, actuation lever 240 is pivoted to angularly rotate outer ring 252 of control ring 246 thereby rotating each of the other actuation levers 240 and nozzle vanes 234 attached thereto. Referring to FIGURE 5, an actuator for use on an otto cycle engine is shown. In the system illustrated, control rod 86 is controlled by a piston type actuator 80. Alternatively, the pistons could be replaced by diaphragms. Actuator 80 is controlled by compressor discharge pressure fed into controller 84 through line 88. Increased pressure into actuator 80 causes the extension of control rod 86 and the corresponding opening of the compressor nozzle area. Referring to FIGURE 5a, control rod 86 is controlled by controller 84 to vary the position of nozzle vanes 234. Controller 84 includes a housing 264 defininy a large cylinder 265 and a small cylinder 266 therein. A large piston 268 having a forward face 268a and a rearward face 268b is received within cylinder 265. A smaller piston 270 having a forward face 270a and a rearward face 270b is received within small cylinder 266. A front plate 272 is attached to housing 264 by suitable bolts and has an aperture 273 therein for receiving control rod 86 into the housing. Piston 270 is fixedly attached to the end of control rod 86 while piston 268 is free to slide relative to control rod 86 being arrested only by ring 274 fixedly attached to control rod 86 adjacent foward face 268a of piston 268. A spring 276 is entrained around control rod 86 and captured between piston 268 and front plate 272. A larger spring 278 encircles control rod 86 and is captured between piston 270 and piston 268.Air lines 88a and 88b communicate to cylinder 266 to the rearward face 270b of piston 270 and within cylinder 265 to the forward face 268a of piston 268. Air lines 88a and 88b have their ends opposite controller 84 attached to the engine intake manifold to convey manifold pressure to the forward face 268a and rearward face 270b of pistons 268 and 270, respectively. Line 89 provides atmospheric pressure to the rearward face 268b and forward face 270a of pistons 268 and 270, respectively. Annular grooves 280 and holes 282 through guide cylinder 284 protruding from the rearward face 268b of piston 268 assures the transmission of atmospheric pressure along the full back surface of piston 268.Likewise, radial grooves 286 on the rearward face of piston 268 facilitate the communication of pressure to the full surface of the rearward face of the piston. Controller 84 is designed to extend control rod 86 to open nozzle vanes 234 to turbine rotor 170 at low and high manifold pressures and to retract control rod 86 to close these nozzle vanes at intermediate pressures. More specifically, while operating at a closed throttle position where the intake manifold is under a vacuum condition, for example with manifold pressures of 5 to 8 pounds per square inch absolute, the controller operates to extend rod 86 to open nozzle vanes 234 permitting the engine to operate with as little back pressure as possible. This results from the laryer atmospheric pressure approximately 14.7 psi absolute exerted on rearward face 268b of piston 268 from line 89 compared to pressure from line 88 which is substantially less than atmospheric pressure. While the net pressure differential across piston 270 provides a force tending to retract control rod 86, the surface areas of pistons 268 and 270 are designed so that the outward force on piston 268 is sufficient to overcome both the retractive pressure on piston 270 as well as the spring force of spring 276. The piston size and spring rate of spring 276 are designed such that as the manifold pressure nears atmospheric pressure, such as 12 pounds per square inch absolute, control rod 86 is drawn within controller 84 to close nozzle vanes 234 thereby increasing the speed of turbocharger 20 and the pressure ratio provided from the turbocharyer compressor. Controller 84 is designed to begin closing vanes 234 immediately before atmospheric pressure is reached because this intake manifold pressure corresponds to an open carburetor throttle and thus indicates a requirement for turbocharger boost. Referring to FIGURE 5a, as the manifold pressure in line 88a exerted against forward face 268a of piston 268 nears atmospheric pressure, this pressure in conjunction with the action of spring 276 overcomes the atmospheric pressure exerted from line 89 on the rearward face 268b of piston 286 to withdraw control rod 86 within controller 84. The pressure differential across piston 270 still provides a net force retracting piston 270 within its cylinder thus assisting in the retraction of control rod 86 within controller 84. As the manifold pressure increases to a value in excess of atmospheric pressure, for instance 20 pounds per square inch absolute, the manifold pressure exerted through line 88b on the rearward face 270b of piston 270 overcomes the spring force of spring 278 causiny the movement of control rod 86 outwardly from controller 84 to again open vanes 234 thereby preventing overpressurization. Control rod 86 is extended from controller 84 in this pressure situation even though piston 268 is retained in a fully retracted position within cylinder 265 because of the capability of control rod 86 to move freely relative to piston 268 when piston 270 overcomes the spring force of spring 278 to move toward piston 268. Therefore, the present controller provides a system for opening the nozzle vanes 234 at manifold pressures having an absolute reading below a predetermined value less than atmospheric as provided for by the design of the controller and components therein. Likewise, the controller provides for the closiny of vanes 234 at manifold pressures ranging from some predetermined value less than atmospheric to some value greater than atmospheric pressure and for the opening of vanes 234 at manifold pressures in excess of a predetermined value above atmospheric pressure. Of course, it will be understood that the particular pressures at which the vanes are opened and closed can be readily altered by variation of the areas of pistons 268 and 270 and the variation in the spring rates and initial deflections of springs 276 and 278. For diesel cycle engines, a solenoid may be used to control piston 268 such that the solenoid maintains shaft 86 in an extended position during light load operations of the engine but releases the shaft when a heavy load is demanded. Upon release of the shaft, spring 276 retracts shaft 86 to close the nozzles thereby increasing turbocharger speed. When sufficient pressure is communicated from the intake manifold to face 270b of piston 270, shaft 86 is extended as previously described to open the nozzles thereby controlling manifold pressure In operation of the variable area turbine nozzle, a control signal, such as compressor discharge pressure, is communicated to actuator 80 which appropriately extends or retracts control rod 86 in accordance with the signal to actuator 80.This in turn results in the rotation of actuation lever 240 attached to control rod 86 and the simultaneous angular rotation of outer ring 252 of control ring 246. The rotation of outer ring 252 in turn rotates each actuation lever 240 to correspondingly set the angle of nozzle vanes 234. FIGURE 4 shows in phantom and solid lines nozzle vanes 234 in closed and open positions. It will be appreciated that each of the nozzle vanes is set by the rotation of control ring 246 through the movement of a single control rod 86 controlled by a single actuation lever 240. Conventional uncontrolled turbochargers normally produce a boost pressure directly related to compressor speed, with compressor speed generally corresponding to engine speed. Therefore, boost pressure in conventional uncontrolled turbochargers is substantially less at low engine speeds than at higher engine speeds. Therefore, at a low engine speed a conventional turbocharyer is ineffective in improving engine performance. Moreover, upon acceleration, there is a substantial lag time until the turbocharyer reaches a speed producing a sufficient boost pressure to effectively improve engine performance. The turbocharger of the present invention may be controlled to provide boost pressure at low engine speeds. This results in improved engine performance at lower engine rpm and eliminates or reduces the lag time associated with conventional turbochargers. The present invention accomplishes this result through the control of the variable turbine nozzles to maintain the turbocharger turbine and compressor speed at a level that produces the desired boost at all engine RPM levels. Referring to FIGURES 6 and 7, illustrating this embodiment of the present invention, a control unit 400 is substituted for actuator 80. Control unit 400 includes a magnetic sensor 402 FIGURE 7 connected to a monitor 403 by way of a pulse to voltage converter 404. The revolutions of shaft 160 are monitored by sensor 402 in cooperation with a disc 160 mounted on shaft 160. Disc 160 has a plurality of discontinuities thereon. The speed of shaft 160 is determined in the well known manner by converting the electrical pulse generated by the movement of the disc relative to magnetic sensor 402 and by inputting these pulses to pulse to voltage converter 404.In turn, this voltage, proportional to the rotational speed of disc 160 and shaft 160, is converted to shaft speed by monitor 403. Monitor 403 is connected by appropriate leads to a proportional controller 414. Controller 414 is connected to a power source 416 and to nozzle area controller unit 415. Unit 415 controls the movement of rod 86 to rotate lever extension 262 and vary the orientation of vanes 234 in the inlet area to turbine rotor 170. In one embodiment of the invention, controller 414 is a microprocessor including a conversion system for receiving analog input from sensors 417 and speed monitor 403 for conversion to digital format usable by the microprocessor. The microprocessor may be of the general type now used in automobile ignition systems. Alternatively, a microprocessor which can be incorporated in the present system is microprocessor model 8080 manufactured by Intel.proportional controller 414 also includes an amplification system for amplifyiny the signal provided from the microprocessor for controlling controller unit 415. The microprocessor may be programmed to control the turbine speed, and thus the boost pressure provided by the turbocharger compressor, as a function of several parameters, for example, engine speed, throttle position, intake manifold pressure, engine torque, ambient temperature, ambient pressure or transmission gearing. As is shown in FIGURE 6, sensors 417 are provided to meter each of these engine parameters and provide the corresponding analog readiny to the proportional controller 414 where they are converted to the digital form for use by the microprocessor. Of course, the microprocessor may be programmed to position the turbine inlet nozzle to control Compressor speed according to any direct or variable relationship of the parameters. Referring now to FIGURE 6a, the proportional controller 414 shown in FIGURE 6 is illustrated in greater detail. A plurality of sensors 417a g measure a parameter relevant to the operation of the automobile engine. Each of the sensors 417 plus the turbine speed monitor 403 produces an analog signal which is transmitted to respective analog to digital converters 424a h. The signals produced by each of these sensors is transformed within the corresponding analog to digial converter into a series of digital words which represent the numerical value of the parameter being measured. The digitized signals produced by the analog to digital converters 424 are conveyed to a microprocessor 426 which is included within proportional controller 414. Microprocessor 426 receives the digitized signals which represent the parameters being measured by sensors 417. The microprocessor evaluates the combination of signals received and produces therefrom a signal which corresponds to the optimum control position for the nozzle vanes 234. The output signal produced by microprocessor 426 is transferred to a digital to analog converter 428 which produces a corresponding nozzle control signal. The output of th digital to analog converter 428 is connected to a driver circuit 429 which amplifies the nozzle control signal. The amplified signal is transmitted to the nozzle area controller unit 415 for selectively positioning the nozzle vanes 234.The driver circuit 429 not only provides amplification for the nozzle control signal, but also isolates the proportional controller 414 from the controller unit 415 as well as from any spurious signals generated in the region of proportional controller 414. The proportional controller 414 and sensors 417 of the present invention utilize the technology which has previously been developed for automotive engine control directed to spark timiny and fuel metering,Existiny systems of this nature are described in an article by Gerald M. Walker, Automotive ElectronicsGets The Green Light, ELECTRONICS, Volume 50, No.20, September 29, 1977 , pages 83 92. Thus, with the present invention, the engine designer may provide a desired boost pressure corresponding to one or more of these or other parameters. Of course, the parameters listed above are only indicative of some of the parameters which an engine designer may wish to use in choosing the optimum turbocharger compressor speed throughout the operation ranye of the engine and turbocharger. The simplest arrangement is represented by merely maintaining the turbine speed, and thus the compressor speed, at a constant level throughout the operation of the engine. In this situation, a set point speed is selected for controller 414.Controller 414 provides a signal to actuator 418 in response to a comparison of the set point speed to the speed indicated from monitor 403. When the shaft speed monitored by monitor 403 is below the set point value of controller 414, controller 414 provides a signal to actuator 418 to retract rod 86 resulting in the rotation of vanes 234 and closing down of the turbine nozzles. As the turbine nozzles are closed down, the turbine speed is increased, increasing the rotation speed of shaft 160. When the shaft speed indicated by monitor 403 is greater than the set point value, the signal from controller 414 to actuator 418 causes the extension of rod 86 and the corresponding opening of the turbine nozzles resulting in a slowdown in the speed of the turbine and shaft 160 attached thereto.By continuing this operation, the speed of the turbine and compressor may be controlled in accordance with a predetermined set point value programmed into controller 414.Therefore, regardless of the engine speed and throttle position, a constant compressor and turbine speed may be maintained by varying the position of vanes 234 to control the flow velocity of exhaust gases against turbine rotor 170. Using the arrangement of the present invention, a relatively high compressor speed may be maintained regardless of engine speed. This is accomplished by the capability of the present invention to vary the turbine nozzle area. Thus, upon engine acceleration, no lag time in boost pressure is experienced because there is no requirement that the compressor speed be increased from a relatively low speed to the higher values constantly maintained by the present turbocharger. Moreover, by maintaining high boost pressures at relatively low engine speeds, the present turbocharger provides improved engine performance at low engine rpm as well as at higher engine speeds. The operation of the turbocharger as just described assumes that the turbocharger compressor is capable of operating through broad flow ranges as in the present invention. As will be described hereinafter, while some advantage would be provided to conventional turbochargers, the advantaye provided by the variable area turbine nozzles of the present invention is greatly extended by its application to the present compressor which is capable of operating over a broad flow range. Thus, conventional turbochargers, plagued with a stall line prohibiting the operation of the compressor over a broad flow range, would not be benefited to the same degree as the present invention by the application of the variable area turbine nozzles. Therefore, the present invention provides a turbocharger with the turbine nozzle area controlled by the movement of a single control ring rotating a plurality of actuator arms circumferentially spaced about the control ring. Moreover, the control ring and actuation levers are positioned in the unused air gap space existing between the turbocharger turbine and compressor thereby making a very compact unit.Moreover, the particular location of the linkage further insulates the bearing assemblies from the heat to which the turbine and the surrounding area is subject. In this way, the bearing assemblies may be oil starved or limitedly lubricated. This in turn eliminates the need for conventional lubrication by use of engine oil and the associated plumbing requirements required by such a lubrication method.this, of course, makes the turbocharger of the present invention less expensive to construct and operate as well as more reliable. Moreover, the use in the present invention of ball bearing supports, and the corresponding elimination of thrust and disc type bearings, provides for a more controlled or stiffer turbine and compressor rotating assembly thereby allowing smaller clearances between both the turbine and the compressor and their surrounding structures. For example, in the present invention, the compressor blade height for a turbocharyer for use with relatively small internal combustion engines could be on the order of 0.2 inches. The use of the ball bearing assemblies described above permits the design of the compressor with only a .005 inch clearance amounting to only 2.5 percent of the overall height of the blade. By contrast, were a journal and disc type bearing to be employed, a substantially greater clearance would be required normally about .015 inch . As a result, the present invention is particularly adaptable to the construction of a turbocharger for smaller internal combustion engines where the smaller blade heights require closer clearances between the blades and the surrounding structure. The use of ball bearings and their resultant lower frictional losses when compared to the journal and disc type bearings also makes possible for the first time the efficient use of a turbocharyer which produces less turbine horsepower without losing a substantial portion of the turbine horsepower to bearing losses and friction. Where a journal and disc type bearing could account for a 4 5 horsepower loss in friction, the loss in friction by the present arrangement would be on the order of 0.1 0.4 horsepower.
