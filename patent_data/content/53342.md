# Screw rotor.

## Abstract
In a screw rotor including a female rotor member 1 and a male rotor member 2 rotatable about parallel shafts 3 and 4 respectively while meshing with each other, the forward face flank of the female rotor member 1 is composed of a first flank 7 of the forward face formed by a parabolic curve, and a second flank 8 of the forward face formed by a circular arc of a radius R₂, and the backward face flank of the female rotor member 1 is composed of a first flank 9 of the backward face generated by the backward face tooth top flank of the male rotor member 2 having a radius R₅, and a second flank 10 of the backward face formed by a circular arc of a radius R₃ which is smaller than the radius R₂ of the second flank 7 of the forward face flank. The tooth profile of the male rotor member 2 is essentially formed by the forward face flank and the backward face flank of the male rotor member 2 .
