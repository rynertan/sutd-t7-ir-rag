## Description
METHODS AND COMPOSITIONS FOR IMPROVING THE NUTRITIVE VALUE OF FOODSCross Reference to Related Applications This is a continuation in part of United StatesPatent Application Serial No. 781,214, filed February 13, 1985.Technical Field This invention relates to compositions and methods for improving the nutritive value of cereal based breads, to novel microbes useful in the fermentation of breads which thereby provide improvements in the bread s nutritive value, to grain and microbe mixtures, and to yeast and microbe mixtures from which breads may be produced.Background Bread produced from wheat flour is a major component of the human diet in many areas of the world, providing most of the required calories and proteins in the diet. In lesser developed countries, the caloric contribution of bread to the diet may be as high as 8 9 . As much as 64 of the daily protein intake in the developing countries is derived from cereal grains from which bread is made. Flat breads, which are made of cereal grains, are the most ancient of breads, and remain especially popular in the Middle East and Indian subcontinents. Many types of flat fermented breads, such as Egyptian baladi bread, are to be found around the world. Standard characteristics include the flat shape, usually with an open, pocketed interior.The doughs are comprised of low protein flour of high extraction, water, salt and leavening agent, either yeast or lactic acid producing bacteria as a sour starter. The formula for Baladi bread dough consists of high extraction 82 to 88 flour, water salt, and 12 to 17 starter fermented dough . Fermentation in the dough is initiated by the activity of wild bacteria and yeast which are present in the starter. For most flat breads the fermentation period is quite short, and is initiated by the activity of bacteria and yeast.The heart of the baking process for all flat breads is the naturally occurring sourdough starter containing microbes. The sourdough starter is responsible for the improved leavening action, the bread s sour taste and an extended shelf life. Following the brief fermentation, the dough of most flat breads is divided, flattened to a form resembling a pancake on a wooden board dusted with wheat bran, and then proofed for another short period.The flattened dough is then baked at high temperatures 488 5BBOC for a short time 1 3 min. . The flat piece of dough rises in the oven. Steam formation, rather than gas production, causes it to separate into two thin layers and form the characteristic pocket. The formula and baking process for producing baladi, and other flat breads are as much a part of tradition as the bread itself. Accordingly, one of the objects of the invention is to provide the means whereby the product can continue to be manufactured economically, in a manner congruent with tradition, and also in such a way as to improve the nutritive value of flat bread. Although the conventional procedure described above yields an excellent product, it is subject to certain nutritional disadvantages as outlined herein and a primary objective of the invention is to provide a procedure which alleviates these disadvantages. Normal cereal grains, including the wheat from which most breads are produced, are low in some of the essential amino acids, i.e., lysine, threonine, methionine, tryptophan and isoleucine, the so called limiting amino acids. Such cereal grains can be considered low quality protein sources. Thus, cereal grain based diets, prevalent in many areas of the world, may be deficient in some essential amino acids. Research has proven that if humans lived primarily on cereal grains with no intake of animal protein, as is the case for people who have flat bread based diets, the protein received would be adequate if it were of a quality comparable to animal protein. Thus, improving the nutritive value of fermented breads such as flatbreads, is of considerable importance to lesser developed countries and other wheat importing nations.This is most effectively accomplished by increasing the lysine content of cereal protein. Further efforts may involve increasing the threonine content thereof, as threonine is generally the next most limiting amino acid after lysine. Accordingly, it would be of tremendous importance and benefit to produce a bread or wheat product with an increased content of the limiting amino acids, thus raising the nutritional value of such products. The nutritive value of the bread depends upon the protein level in the flour and on the balance of various amino acids that make up the protein. Normal cereal grains, including wheat, are low in some of the essential amino acids that is, lysine, threonine, methionine, tryptophan, and isoleucine, the so called limiting amino acids. This limitation causes protein in the bread to be poorly utilized by the body.Accordingly, it would be of tremendous importance and benefit to produce a wheat bread with an increased content of limiting amino acids, thus raising the nutritional value of such products. In order for the human body to properly utilize protein, the essential amino acids must be available simultaneously and in the most advantageous proportions. The FAO Food andAgriculture Organization recommends a minimum lysine ratio of 5.2 in protein as an ideal proportion of lysine for infants. Wheat protein generally has only about 5 of this ideal recommended level. If lysine can be added to such wheat based diets, a higher value of wheat protein can be realized. Such approaches as breeding and growing cereal grains for quality have shown that increasing the nutritional value of cereal grains leads to a decreased yield and vice versa. Blending wheat flour with alternate protein sources such as soybean meal or fish meal has been generally unacceptable because of the cost of the protein source and taste preference or consumers acceptance. The prior art teaches that various microorganisms and their mutant strains have been used to produce lysine. For example, U. S. Patent 2,841,532 to Kita et al discloses the use of E. coli to produce lysine. U.S. Patent 2,979,439 to Kinoshita et al teaches that lysine may be produced from a mutant of Micrococcus glutamicus. U. S. Patent 3,524,797 to Boyd et al discloses a method wherein lysine is produced by cultivating a double mutant of Micrococcus glutamicus.In U. S. Patent 3,527,672 to Kubota et al, lysine is produced from mutant strains of Brevibacterium lactofermentum. U. S. Patent 3,756,916 to Leavitt teaches specific methods for isolating a mutant strain of an amino acid producing microorganism, usuallyBrevibacterium glutamicus. U. S. Patent 3,9g5,866 toWatanabe et al describes a process for the production of lysine by a mutant strain of Pseudomonas orAchromobacter. U. S. Patents 4,275,157 to Tosaka et al and 4,411,992 to Schi.azki et al teach the production of lysine by culturing mutants of Corynebacterium orBrevibacterium. None of these prior art teachings, however, teach or suggest the inoculation of lysine excreting mutant strains into a bread or wheat product to enhance the lysine content thereof and thereby increase the nutritional value. The prior art also discloses that it is known to use bacteria in the production of bread. For example,U. S. Patent 3,734,743 and U. S. Patent 3,891,773 toKline et al teach the use of Lactobacillus sanfrancisco in preparing sourdough breads. U. S. Patent 3,963,835 to Gryczka teaches that wild type Lactobacillus fermenti may be used to produce sourdough bread. However, to Applicants knowledge, there has not been any disclosure for improving the nutritive value of fermented breads through the use of lysine excreting microorganisms or use of lysine excreting bacteria in a bread or wheat products.Summary of the Invention It is therefore one object of the invention to provide a lysine excreting microorganism to improve the nutritional value of grains and breads. A further object of the present invention is to provide a pure culture of the microorganism which may be used to improve the nutritional value of bread. A still further object of the invention is to provide a method for producing the lysine excreting microorganism. It is even a further object of the invention to provide a wheat product enhanced in protein using a lysine excreting microorganism. A still further object of the invention is to provide a method for enhancing the protein quality of wheat that involves treating the wheat with a lysineexcreting microorganism. A further object is to provide a bread starter which comprises a dominant, non pathogenic active fermenting, non biohazardous lactic acid bacteria combined with the proper level of baker s yeast for leavening. A further object of the invention is to provide an enhanced protein quality bread which has been treated with a lysine excreting microorganism. An additional object of the invention is to provide a method for enhancing the protein quality of bread whichcomprises treatment of the bread with a lysine excreting microorganism. Other objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent as the description thereof proceeds. In satisfaction of the foregoing objects, the present invention provides a novel microorganism having the identifying characteristics of the speciesLactobacillus fermentum Lex , methods for production thereof, and methods for the introduction of the microorganisms into wheat and bread products to provide said products with improved nutritive values. This invention includes the method for spontaneously mutating and selecting the heterofermentative bacterium Lactobacillus fermentum, isolating the lysine excreting strain L. fermentum Lex from the wild type L. fermentum, forming a pure culture, optionally freeze drying said pure culture, and forming a sourdough starter comprising wheat flour, salt, water and the aforementioned pure culture of L.fermentum Lex . This starter may be added during the fermentation period of the bread or wheat product to increase the nutritive value. Also provided are the resulting improved wheat and bread products treated with the culture. The invention also includes grains such as wheat which have been treated with culture, preferably in freeze dried form.The invention also includes a bread starter comprising the culture combined with yeastBrief Description of the Drawings Reference is now made to the drawings accompanying the application wherein Figure 1 is a diagram showing the presumed lysine biosynthesis pathway in L. fermentum and Figure 2a is a graph which illustrates the feedback inhibition of threonine on lysine biosynthesis in L. fermentum Figure 2b is a graph which illustrates the release of feedback inhibition of threonine on the lysine biosynthesis in L. fermentum Figure 3 is a graph showing the lysine level as affected by degree of flour extractions using the bacterium of the invention and Figure 4 is a graph showing the effects of bacterial inoculation dose on the development time of baladi bread dough.Description of Preferred Embodiments As discussed, the present invention relates to mutant microorganisms capable of excreting excessive lysine, methods for selecting and isolating these microorganisms and wheat and bread products inoculated with these mutant organisms, which products have increased nutritional value due to their higher lysine content. In a preferred embodiment, these mutant microorganisms are strains of Lactobacillus fermentum, a hetero fermentative lactobacillus. The invention is concerned specifically with an organism having the identifying characteristics of Lactobacillus fermentumLex strains M11 and M14 which are capable of producing an excess amount of amino acids, lysine in particular.Further, the invention is concerned with uses of these bacteria in increasing the nutritive values of grains and breads or other foods produced therefrom. In order to place the invention in proper focus, it is necessary to outline the nutritional limitations of wheat used in bread production. The quality of consumed protein in the nutrition of a person is of equal or greater importance than the quantity. In order for the human body to properly utilize protein, the essential amino acids must be available simultaneously in the most advantageous proportions.If one of the essential amino acids is missing limiting , body utilization of other amino acids is wasted in that they are used up for energy rather than for vital regulatory or protein building processes. High quality proteins upon digestion provide balanced supplies of the human s essential amino acids and can subsequently be absorbed as precursors for body protein formation. Because it is well established that the normal cereal grains, including wheat, are low in some of the essential amino acids i.e., lysine, methionine, threonine, tryptophan and isoleucine, such cereal grains can be considered as low quality protein sources. Lysine is the initial amino acid normally limiting in cereal grains. Assuming that the UN FAO Food andAgriculture Organization ratio of 5.2 lysine in the protein comprises the ideal proportion of lysine for infants, wheat protein generally has only about 588 of the ideal recommended level. According to FAO data, cereal grains comprise 65 668 of the calorie supply for people of developing countries, whereas animal products provide merely 6 of the calories. Information fromFAO also reveals that in the Middle East, plant sources provide 80 of the daily protein supply, with animal source foods supplying only 2 . Thus, given the previous information, the average diet in developing countries is primarily comprised of low value proteins that are lysine deficient. If lysine can be added to such wheat based diets, a higher value for wheat protein can be attached. For example, egg protein is considered the food with the most ideal proportion of amino acids, with a nutritional value of 93 on a 100 point scale. If wheat flour is supplemented with .1 lysine, its protein value can be increased from 35 to 55. Even smaller increases in lysine content can make a significant improvement in protein value. Another test of protein quality is the ProteinEfficiency Ratio PER . It represents the amount of weight gained in proportion to the amount of protein fed. An example of this test, using wheat, provides aPER of .93. By adding the same B.18 of lysine, thePER is raised to 1.45, an increase of one and a half times the original. Research has shown that if humans lived on primarily cereal grains such as flat breads, with no intake of animal protein, the amount of protein consumed would be adequate if it were of a quality comparable to animal proteins. Improvement of the nutritive value of cereal based breads, the primary objective of the invention, is of considerable importance to lesser developed countries as well as other wheat importing nations. This is most effectively accomplished by first increasing lysine.Further nutritional improvement in fermented breads would involve increasing threonine, the next most limiting amino acid. This nutritional improvement of bread can be achieved by utilizing several techniques, including that presented in this invention. It is important that these various different means, aside from the invention, and their limitations be understood for complete comprehension of the invention s significance. The aforementioned wheat quality deficiencies can be rectified by breeding and growing cereal grains for quality. However, the limitations of breeding wheat toward improved nutritional value are many. Plant breeding comprises a selection for the traditional problems of high yield, drought resistance, pest resistance, etc., with each component adding an ever increasing level of difficulty, and the addition of nutritional quality only further increases the burden on the breeder. It has been shown that increasing the nutritional value of cereal grains leads to a decreased yield and vice versa. This inverse correlation between breeding yield and nutrition is due to a forced redeployment of plant energy from carbohydrate storage to protein storage.In addition, wheat breeding is an exceedingly slow process, with the creation of a new variety and its introduction into the field taking as long as ten years. In addition, the plant breeding process is subject to such additional hazards as adverse climate, high production cost, and dependence on fertilizer. Ultimately, breeding desirable nutritional traits into wheat by any methodology is a multi faceted problem. Blending wheat flour with alternate protein sources such as soybeans also improves the bread s nutritional balance. The problems with this method are the cost of the protein source and taste preference or acceptance by the consumer.Another complication is that part of the lysine added to bread in pure form 1 lysine HC1 or in bound form is destroyed during baking. The percent loss during baking ranges between 12 and 218. With the biotechnical approach of this invention, the protein quality of any bread can be improved or supplemented by fermenting the dough utilizing special strains of bacteria capable of producing high levels of amino acids that are low in the cereal flour, particularly lysine. This supplementation by fermentation is the method encompassed by the present invention. The invention thus involves mutants of the bacterium Lactobacillus fermentum strains Mll and M14 Lex . These bacteria, indigenous to Egypt, were isolated from native sourdough starter, and developed as novel strains according to the novel procedures set forth herein. The bacteria L. fermentum Lex strains Mll and M14 were produced as taught herein to provide an advantage over starter bacteria of the wild type, due to their increased ability to excrete lysine. In one embodiment, the invention includes procedures to isolate, mutate, select, and then reintroduce the L.fermentum Lex into native sourdough starter. When this bacteria is added to the starter, bread such as flat bread can be produced in the conventional manner with the advantage of increased lysine levels, which subsequently improve the bread s nutritive value. This biotechnical technique is superior for several reasons to alternate means presented for nutritionally improving bread. First, it is effective regardless of the initial quality of the flour. It can be utilized in addition to research findings concerning other nutritional improvement strategies. As pointed out, it is compatible with the economy, tradition and time constraints involved in producing a nutritionally improving bread, such as flat bread, native to developing countries. Preparing the starter with the improved microbes is a relatively simple and inexpensive process. It also permits developing countries to continue importing the relatively inexpensive wheat necessitated by their limited economies. This method also allows for a great deal of flexibility because countries or individuals have the choice of whether or not to use the starter enhanced by L. fermentum Lex . The production of new strains of bacteria can proceed far more rapidly and with greater genetic flexibility than can the production of new wheat cultivars. Thus, the present invention is concerned with the organism Lactobacillus fermentum Lex , strains Mll and M14, and the process of improving the nutritive values of grains and cereal based bread. As noted above, the invention is useful in providing sourdough starter and resulting bread with increased nutritive values.In a further aspect, the invention provides procedures and compositions by which the nutritive value of wheat or other grain is increased. Thus, the novel bacterium of the invention may be added to the wheat or other grain in bulk. Thereafter, bread produced from the treated wheat will have the increased nutritive content. Preferred species used in this invention areLactobacillus fermentum Lex strain Mull, ATCC 3991g andLactobacillus fermentum Lex strain M14, ATCC 39911. A culture of each of these preferred species has been placed on deposit with the American Type CultureCollection, 12381 Park Lawn Drive, Rockville, Maryland 2g852, and the accession numbers set forth above have been assigned thereto. After issuance of the patent, all restrictions on availability of the deposited cultures to the public will be irrevocably removed. The deposits will be maintained for a period of 3 years from the deposit date, and accordingly, the cultures will be permanently available to the public after issuance of the patent. Hetero fermentative lactobacilli utilize the hexose prophosphate shunt Embden Meyerhof pathway, mixed acid class and produce from each mole of glucose fermented one mole each of lactic acid, ethanol andCO2. An indigenous Egyptian sourdough starter Soltani was obtained from the Seed Technology Lab at the Agricultural Research Center in Giza, Egypt. The predominant fermenting component of such a starter includes a group of bacteria lactobacilli that produce lactic acid the sourness and imperfect yeasts that produce CO2 which slightly leavens the bread.Several isolations were made from the Soltani starter using lysine assay medium with the addition of maltose g.l w v . With hetero fermentative lactobacilli, both CO2 and lactic acid are produced and the acid product is 5 less than under homo fermentative conditions, wherein two moles of lactic acid are produced from each mole of glucose.. The slower increase in acidity permits fermentation, and thus lysine production to proceed for a longer period.Species of the hetero fermentative bacteria,Lactobacillus fermentum were used for selection and mutation in this invention. The L. fermentum has the following description Gram positive rod, non motile, catalase negative, produces acid and gas from glucose and gluconate, can ferment arabinose, galactose, lactose, mannose, and xylose but not cellobiose and trehalose, grows at 450C not at 150C Bergey s Manual, 1974 . Wild types of L. fermentum obtained from Egypt do not produce detectable excess amino acids. They merely produce sufficient amino acids for their own use.Thus, in order to obtain strains which have the identifying characteristics of Mll, ATCC 39918 and M14, ATCC 39911, of L. fermentum Lex which are capable of excreting excess amino acids, particularly lysine, it was necessary to select repeatedly. The preferred species were selected as regulatory mutants of a particular system of lysine synthesis, said systems being demonstrated by Figures 1 and 2a accompanying the application. According to the regulatory systems, one aspartokinase is subject to multivalent feedback inhibition by threonine and lysine Fig. 2a , and one homoserine dehydrogenase is subject to feedback inhibition by threonine and repression by methionine Fig. 1 . Accordingly, these regulatory systems were used to isolate regulatory mutants from L.fermentum by isolation of L lysine analog resistant mutants. According to the invention, the selection procedures involve exposing the bacteria to sequentially higher levels of the following amino acid analogs, first singly and then in combination 5 Samino ethyl cysteine, gamma hydroxylysine, lysine hydroxymate and cyclohexylalanine. The resulting mutants synthesize aspartokinase insensitive to multivalent feedback inhibition by lysine or threonine to increase the production of lysine from aspartate.To maximize the flow from aspartate to lysine, further selections are carried out and mutants with homoserine dehydrogenase insensitive to feedback inhibition by threonine and repression by methionine are isolated.Examples of such mutants include but are not limited toMet , Thr , Ill , Lex and EthR. The mutation selection cycle is repeated as many as ten to fifteen times to increase the genetic variability in the microorganisms. In addition to biochemical marker systems, antibiotic marking is also used in identification and selection of the mutants. Measurement of the amino acid excretions by the mutants was made by a cross feeding method and thin layer chromatography with modified mobile phase npropanol, 58 parts NH40H, 27 parts and H20, 15 parts , which permitted several thousand isolates a day to be screened. The strains ability to excrete lysine was manifested by inoculation into 3t W V wheat flour water extract. After over night incubation, the lysine bioassay using Leuconostoc mesenteroides Pediococcus cerevisiae ATCC 843 was applied to select the highest lysine excretors. The preferred species of this invention strains Mll andM14 of L. fermentum Lex proved to have excreted lysine in the highest amounts. As noted above, these have been deposited with ATCC, under Accession Numbers 39918and 39911, respectively.In its broadest aspect, this invention covers any microorganism which has been mutated and isolated from a proven biosynthetic pathway and which excretes an excess amount of lysine and which has the identifying characteristics of either Mll,ATCC 39918, or M14, ATCC 39911. In conducting the selection process, pure strains are initially grown in a suitable broth and then washed with a buffer solution such as potassium phosphate.The resulting cells are then suspended in a lysine assay broth and incubated. Incubation conditions are generally for 14 to 2 hours at 34 to 380C, under which conditions only the resistant cells will continue to grow, and these can be seen to increase to the point of turbidity, i.e., greater than 187 cells per milliliter.A serial transfer is then made to a fresh container of the same broth, so as to eliminate escape cells. The lysine treatment, incubation and growth of resistant cells followed by separation, is repeated several times with sequentially higher analog concentrations. These concentrations begin at 188B and increase up to 1BB,000 ppm analog. The analogs used are 5 S amino ethylcysteine, gamma hydroxylysine, and cyclohexylalanine.From the highest concentration, the cultures are diluted and plated onto indicator plates. The plates should contain lysine assay media seeded with a lysine requiring bacterium. The bacteria producing the largest zones of indicator bacteria are streaked to purity and then single colonies are bioassayed.Repeating these steps with several analogs individually and finally in combination will provide mutant strains producing the maximum concentration of lysine. The resultant strains selected by this procedure have the capacity to excrete significantly higher amounts of lysine than is excreted by the wildtype or natural strain of this microorganism. In a second aspect of the present invention, pure cultures of freeze dried L. fermentum Lex are provided. In this aspect of the invention, the bacteria which are isolated in accordance with the method of the invention, were found to grow well on MRS broth at 370C 98.60F for 12 16 hours. The mass cells were separated by centrifugation and washed three times with a sterile saline solution and then resuspended in .1 w v, sodium alginate by the method disclosed inJapanese Patent 15 43898, 1977, the disclosure of thisJapanese Patent 15 43898 being incorporated herein by reference. The suspension was freeze dried, packed in closed polyethylene bags and stored dry at room temperature.By using this method, it was demonstrated that the viability of freeze dried bacteria could be maintained indefinitely. Further, it was found that lysine excretion efficiency is not adversely affected by the freeze drying process. This embodiment provides the microorganism in a form suitable for commercial use. In a third aspect of the present invention, cereal grains treated with the microorganisms of the invention are provided, which have enhanced protein quality. In a further embodiment of the invention, enhanced protein quality wheat is used to produce fermented breads with enhanced nutritive value. Enhanced nutritional value in wheat products is particularly advantageous agriculturally in developing countries where cereal grains comprise 65 66 of the caloric intake of the people of those countries. An important aspect of the invention resides in treatment of cereal grains with the microorganisms of the invention, as indicated above. The preferred cereal grain to be treated is wheat, since bread is made from wheat as described herein. Thus, in a preferred embodiment of the invention, cereal grains such as wheat are treated in bulk with microorganisms which have the characteristics of those described herein. The microorganisms are preferably applied in freeze dried form, which may be produced as indicated above. A sufficient amount of the freeze dried organism or culture should be added to the wheat in bulk to provide the necessary enhanced nutritive value.The amount of freeze dried culture to be added to the bulk cereal grain will usually be sufficient to provide a bacterial count to the wheat of about 13 to 188 cells per gram of wheat, or about 8.1 to l ppm for wheat treated in bulk. Preferably, there is present sufficient culture to be present in the range of about 6 to 168 cells gram flour. In this aspect of the invention, the wheat or other cereal grain can be treated with the freeze dried culture in bulk prior to shipping. Thereafter, when the wheat is used to make bread, the culture will be present to increase the nutritive level of the resulting product, such as bread. In another embodiment, there is provided a method for creating a starter material useful for enhancing the protein quality of wheat and bread. To create the starter in one aspect, a basic formula of soft wheat flour of 82 extraction, 186 parts table salt, 1.2 parts water, 70 parts v w and freeze dried bacterial cells were used. The water proportion was varied within certain limits 65 v w often used . The starter was made from a pure culture of L. fermentum Lex Mll or M14 as provided by the invention or a portion of developed starter obtained from a previous batch fermented with L. fermentum Lex ATCC 39918 orATCC 39911 . The above innoculum was added in such doses as to provide a maximum lysine level during the. dough fermentation period lss 12 hrs with regard to the level of sourness lactic acid accepted by the bread consumers. Dose experiments, for example, showed that starter additions at a zero make up time from 186 to 1e8 bacterial cells gram flour were sufficient to produce a high nutritive value dough. During the developmental period, at room temperature, i.e., 25 3g0C 77 860F , the bacterial cell mass increased approximately 16 12 times, the pH dropped to 4.1 3.8 and the total lysine content reached 3.22 , considerably above the normal content of 2.87 .Portions of the developed starter 1.2x 1Bs 1.2 x 189 cells gram flour dry base could be refrigerated 40C for use in the next batch. The starter may be recycled as long as the batches are prepared daily or can be refrigerated. If the starter shows any undesirable signs, such as spoiling or decrease in strength, the preparation of new starter using freeze dried bacterial cells is preferable. In order to ensure high quality bread under the conditions prevailing in developing countries, the starter should not be recycled more than 7 18 times. Otherwise, continuous amendment of wheat flour by the proper number of the freeze dried bacteria should be taken into consideration. In a further embodiment of the invention, there is provided a method for batch fermenting dough into bread simulating the commercial practice in Egypt. The primary component of the bread dough was a soft wheat flour of 82 extraction and 11.2 11.8 protein air dry base . The dough ingredients included 188 parts by weight flour, 1.2 parts sodium chloride, variable amounts of water, and starter from either freeze dried bacterial cells 186 188 cells g flour , as provided in another aspect of this invention, or a portion of the last fermentation batch provided by the bacteria of the present invention i.e., 18 12 parts. According to this aspect of the invention, the ingredients were mixed together for 5 minutes and then allowed to ferment for 8 10 hours at 25 30 C 77 860F at over 9 relative humidity. The dough was divided and formed into loaves which were 6mm thick, measured 15 28 cm in diameter, and 65g. in weight. The molded loaves of dough were transferred onto trays that had been dusted with a thin layer of bran. They were then placed in the proofing cabinet for 1 hour at 380C 860F and 90 relative humidity. Samples were taken from the fermented dough and some were placed in the refrigerator for the next batch fermentation. The amount of water needed depended on the water absorption of the flour, which was variable. Larger amounts of water tended to make the dough very slack, requiring special handling techniques. The elevated water levels, however, developed a highly nutritive dough. Using soft wheat flour at 82 extraction at levels of 6 75 water, the highest levels of free lysine were obtained. Under such conditions, the lysine bioassay technique was used on the dough fermented with both the wild type bacteria, and the modified L. fermentum Lex ATCC 39918 and 39911 bacteria. The lysine bioassay technique revealed that a significant amount of lysine had been excreted in the modified system.The lysine excretions from the system of the invention reached a level of 3.2 4.7 of the total protein content as compared to 2. 2.5 in dough developed from the wild type L. fermentum p 0.001 . The proofed dough was transferred onto a wooden peel which was used to slide the dough into the oven.The dough was baked in a carousel oven at a temperature of 3540C 6780F for 2 2.5 min. Following baking, samples from the baked bread were freeze dried and then ground for amino acid analysis. In a still further embodiment of the invention, there is provided yeast and microbe mixtures as bread starters. This embodiment provides a starter mixture which will consistently provide a bread of high protein content, thus providing standardization in the bread making process. Standardization of any system is considered the first step for manipulation and improvement of the system and determine any significant contribution of the suggested improvement. However, there has not been any standardization known for the Baladi bread starter, especially the microbial components. The lack of information about the identity of these microbial components has prevented work to improve the quality ofBaladi bread. By the methods and products of the present invention, standardization of the starter is now possible through the utilization of the dominant, non pathogenic, active fermenting, non biohazardous lactic acid bacteria of the invention combined with the proper level of baker s yeast for leavening. Traditional recycling of Baladi starters gives unpredictable results and can produce health hazards.Microbial contamination of the starter may take place during handling and processing of dough by experiment and or personnel. In private bakeries, especially in villages and small towns or whenever the environment is polluted, there are no attempts to clean or sanitize the equipment to reduce such contamination. Continued use of the starter technique over longer periods may increase the contamination of the starter by other microorganisms. It has been discovered according to the present invention that when the microbes of the invention are used to initiate the starter, the bread can be uniformly produced in the conventional manner.However, because of its increased ability to excrete lysine, the resulting bread will have the advantage of increased lysine levels and will be free of contamination. The result will be improved nutritive value of the bread. This technique has proven to be superior since it is effective regardless of the initial quality of the flour, and it is compatible with the economy, tradition, and time constraints involved in producingBaladi bread. According to the present invention, these improved results can be obtained using a mixture of 10 to 4 3 parts of the lactobacilli starter fermented with 106 cells gram of flour and about 175 275 mg of dry yeast per kg of flour. Preferably about 2 3 3 3 parts of the lactobacilli per gram of flour are used with 200 250 mg of yeast per kg of flour. The packaged mixture of yeast and microbe would preferably contain a cell count of yeast to microbe of about 1 1 3 3 up to 1 1888. In a most preferred aspect, the Lactobacillus fermentum can be supplied in a freeze dried form in packages sealed carefully to protect the viability of the bacteria. Such packages will need little special care in handling or storage. Further, in the automatic or semi automatic systems, the Baladi bread formula usually contains 2.5 to 3 g dry yeast kg flour which is equivalent to 2.5 to 3. 3 kg ton. UtilizingLactobacillus fermentum of the invention requires only 3.25 to 3.3 3 g dry yeast kg flour which is equivalent to 25 3 to 3 3 3 g dry yeast ton flour about 10 of the original amount .The improved Baladi bread will have 2 3.1 higher lysine content than the conventional, which will provide 2 3.1 more protein for the people. Specific examples of the present invention will now be set forth. It is understood that these examples are merely illustrative, and are in no way to be interpreted as limiting the scope of the invention. In the examples and throughout the application, parts are by weight unless otherwise indicated. In this specification, reference to amino acids means l amino acids.Example 1 This example describes the selection process for obtaining the mutated strains of the Lactobacillus fermentum Lex microorganisms identified as ATCC 39910 and 39911. An indigenous Egyptian sourdough starter Soltani was obtained from the Seed Technology Lab at the Agricultural Research Center in Giza, Egypt. The fermenting component of this starter included a group of Lactobacilli. Species of the heterofermentative bacteria, Lactobacillus fermentum, were used for selection and mutation. The L. fermentum is a Gram positive rod, non motile, catalase negative bacteria.Pure strains of this species were grown for 16 hours inMRS broth. They were then washed three times with 3. 35 molar potassium phosphate buffer at a pH of 6.8. The washed cells were then resuspended in 3.3 milliliters of lysine assay broth, which contained 5 3 3 ppm of lysine analog. This suspension was then incubated at 35 C for 16 hours. During incubation, only the resistant cells continued growing, and these could be seen to increase to the point of turbidity. Turbidity occurs at a concentration of greater than 107 cells per milliliter. A serial transfer was then made to a new tube containing the same broth, but eliminating the escape cells.The preceding steps of washing, incubating, growing and transferring were then repeated 2 to 4 times with sequentially higher analog concentrations, i.e., 1.000, 2.000, 5.000, 10.000, 30.000, 50.000 and 100.000 ppm analogs. Generally, the analogs in the order that they were used were 5 Sam ino ethyl cysteine, then gamma hydroxylys ine, and then cyclohexylalanine. Combinations of the first two analogs were made, then all three were combined. From the highest concentration, the cultures were diluted and plated onto Difco lysine assay medium to obtain isolated colonies. Single colonies were chosen at random and patched onto indicator plates containing lysine assay agar seeded 106 ml with lysine auxotroph bacteria, Leuconostoc mesenteroides Pediococcus cerevisiae ATCC 8 343. Colonies which produced the largest zones of indicator bacteria were streaked to purity, and single colonies were bioassayed in 5 milliliter lysine assay broth tubes. The steps of diluting and plating onto indicator plates followed by streaking to purity and bioassaying were repeated using three different analogs individually, and finally in combination, to provide a maximum total concentration of 100.000 ppm analog.The recovered bacteria were identified as M11 and M14, which are described herein as ATCC 39910 and ATCC 39911. These were the bacteria used in the following further examples.Example 2 A Baladi bread production trial was conducted using the following formulation Soft wheat flour 82 ext. 1 3 3 parts Water 7 3 parts Sodium chloride 1.2 parts Bacterial starter freeze dried strain ATCC 39910 108 cells g flour The dough ingredients and starter were mixed for three minutes, fermented for eight hours then 1 1 2 hours proofing, baked for 2 1 2 min. at 3540C 670 F , cooled at room temperature for two hours, freeze dried, then ground with a flour mill. Samples from the proofed dough were also freeze dried. Non fermented no bacteria and wildtype bacteria doughs were used as controls. Samples were analyzed for amino acids by ion exchange chromatography. The following Table 1 sets forth the results of the amino acid analyses.

Missouri Columbia,Dr. Charles Gherke. Values represent average of three replications as percent of amino acids per total amount of amino acids present. As will be noted from Table 1, the amino acid analysis of the Baladi bread mixture fermented with the selected mutant L fermentum Lex strain ATCC 39910 or its wildtype and the control dough, both before and after baking, showed oo significant differences in the content of amino acids other than lysine. Lysine, however, was significantly higher in the doughs or breads 8.5 and 21.718 respectively fermented with the selected mutant than those fermented with the wildtype, P B.BB1 or control. During baking, the conventional wildtype fermented dough decreased in lysine by 14.1 of the total lysine content. In contrast, the dough fermented with the lysine excreting mutant decreased only 4.1 of the total lysine content.The slight increase in the lysine content in the conventional system over the control may be explained by experimental error and or due to the mass of bacterial inoculum used for fermentation. Loss of lysine during baking is a common phenomenon, wherein compounds are formed which destroy or bind lysine into unavailable forms. Monomolecular destruction, strong Maillard reaction and dextrinization of starch at high baking temperatures have been reported as causative factors. The explanation of this apparent protection of lysine during baking by the mutant fermentors of the invention, as compared to the wildtype, is not clear.Example 3 This experiment illustrates the effects of various dough water flour ratios on bacterial lysine production in the dough. A series of doughs were prepared with various levels of water as shown in Table 2 and freelysine content was determined as shown in Example 3.Both Mll and M14 bacteria were used and the wild type bacteria was used as a control.

Increasing the proportions of water in the dough mix had no significant effects on such activity.Using the new bacterium increased the amount of freelysine content significantly, presumably by releasing some of the bound lysine as well as by lysine excretion. These effects a ccount for increases in lysine over the wildtype ranging from 44 63 and 50 100 for the mutants ATCC 39910 and ATCC 39911 respectively. Dough mixtures containing between 60 75 parts water 100 parts flour v w were shown to be the optimum ratio for bacteria to grow and excrete a considerable amount of lysine.Example 4 Effects of Bacterial Inoculum Dose on Fermentation This experiment illustrates the effect of a series of doses of freeze dried bacterial cells on quality of the fermented dough. A series of doughs was prepared using the formulation described in Example 2 with the addition of the bacterial doses shown in Table 3 as follows. A dough containing 3 cells g flour served as a control. Cross feeding bioassays for lysine usingLeuconostoc mesenteroides Pediococcus cerevisiae ATCC 8 343 made on the water extracts of the fermented dough showed that 106 108 cell g flour were required to obtain significant increases in free lysine content.

The degree of flour extraction or milling is an apparent factor in lysine production in the dough Fig.4 . Using the higher flour extractions, 100 of the original wheat resulted in higher lysine content, compared with 72 extraction flour. Apparently the bran content of the whole grain, 100 extraction, improved the growth of these bacteria. This table indicates that about 106 cells g is a preferred level to attain for significant increased lysine levels. In cases using the lower doses, it is preferable to ferment the dough for lengthier periods to get significantly higher levels of lysine and acid. The bread sourness acid must be increased to an acceptable level as evidenced by taste tests. The time course study of fermentation Figure 3 shows an increase in free lysine concommitant with a decrease in pH.Example 5 Nutritive Analysis of Fermented Breads This experiment tested the bioavailability of the proteins in the baked Baladi bread fermented with the selected mutant L. fermentum Lex strain ATCC 39910 or the wildtype WT . Baladi bread mix non fermented and casein diets were used as controls. The diet composition is presented in Table 4 below using rats as control animals.

Ten rats were assigned to each test and diet treatments were stratified by row and tier to minimize cage location effects. Table 5 summarizes the results obtained comparingProtein Efficiency Ratio PER , body weight gain, and feed conversion rates for a 28 day period. The conventional bacteria fermentation followed with high baking temperatures caused severe damage to the flour protein quality. There was a 17.2 P g. 33 3 lower PER and 16.6 p 3. 32 higher conversion rate recorded in the conventional system as compared to non fermented flour. As shown in Table 5, this decrease in biological measures, resulted from the joint effects of the lysine destruction under high baking temperature and of possible Maillard reaction which tended to decrease the bioavailability of lysine. In the growth comparison, the effect was even more evident. Growth decreased by 27.5 P 3. 37 from the control. The selected mutant L. fermentum Lex strains ATCC 39910AND 39911 successfully increased the nutritive value of the Baladi bread P 3. 3 35 . The excellent growth of the rats fed the casein diet indicated that the rats used in this experiment were normal, healthy and of good quality for testing problem quality. The new bacterium manifested this improvement through the lysine excretion 22.7 higher than conventional system P 0.001 . Apparently some kind of protective mechanism decreased the amount of the destroyed or unavailable lysine during baking at high temperatures only 4.1 destruction in the new bread compared to 14.1 in conventionally fermented bread .

Table 6 shows the results which confirm that the best potential starter is prepared using 106 to 107 cells g flour dry base . The starter caused up to 71 leavening in the dough mix, decreased the pH to 4.79, and increased the amount of lysine by bioassay. Using either 20 or 30 starter in the dough mix showed little differences in the quality of the fermented dough.

The results of this example as shown in Table 7 showed that the preparation of the dough mix with the Lactobacillus cell mass more than 5 3 3 times the yeast cell mass stimulated yeast growth, and relatively decreased theLactobacilli cell mass. The decreasing pH which occurs as the Lactobacilli grow increased the yeast growth.On the other hand, the amount of lysine excreted in the fermented dough tended to be positively correlated only to the absolute amount of Lactobacillus cell mass in the dough mix.

The addition of dry yeast doses alone 100 to 25 3 mgs. dry yeast kg flour showed no fermentation activities during the three hours fermentation time, and no leavening occurred in the dough. The pH and the free lysine content by bioassay technique showed no different from the control experiment. The combination of dry yeast and the Lactobacillus starter decreased the amount of free lysine in the fermented dough but total lysine remained constant. It has been shown that yeast cells utilize free lysine to convert it to a bound form during growth. Strong leavening 53 73 was obtained when 200 250 mg. dry yeast kg flour was used in the dough mix.

The texture was very smooth, and the improved bread kept its fresh appeal longer than the conventional bread.Example 18 The Meet Okba Baking Plant, a government owned unit, utilizing the traditional Baladi bread technique, was selected for the next step. The baking process there is primarily conducted by hand. Batches were 100 kg each, and the starter was prepared according to the following formula Baladi flour, 82 ext. 2g kgMutant bacteria or 186 to 187 cells g flourSoltani starter 15 12 unbaked loaves from previous conventional batchWarm water 18 to 11 litersThe ingredients were mixed carefully with a low speed blender and then covered with linen cloths and fermented overnight in a warm place 24 280C .On the next day, the Baladi bread was prepared according to the formula Baladi flour, 82 ext. 155 kgOvernight starter of the Mutant or Soltani 28 to 3 3 kgWarm water 75 to 98 litersDry yeast 25 gSalt, NaC1 1.2 kgThe ingredients were mixed well for 15 to 20 minutes and then covered with linen cloths for 95 minutes at room temperature 24 to 280C . The fermented dough was divided by hand into 190 g pieces and proofed on a dusted board for another 95 minutes at room temperature. The dough pieces were flattened by hand and baked at 455 4550C for 1 to 1.5 minutes. It is important to note from Table 9 the importance of the effect of the water content in the dough mix on the amount of available lysine produced during fermentation. Higher moisture levels facilitate the growth of the bacteria during which more lysine is produced. Utilizing the above formula, process, andLactobacillus fermentum lysine excretor with the addition of a very small dose of dry yeast 25 g lBB kg as a leavening agent, it was found that an excellent product could be made. The improved Baladi bread was highly accepted by professional personnel baking industry , nutritionists, technologists, and consumers. The improved Baladi bread is characterized by its flavor and overall appeal crust, color, uniformity . The processing conditions gave a perfect fermentation which resulted in ideal pocket separation with a uniform interior. Both the upper and the lower crusts had almost the same thickness. The crumb was soft and uniform in texture and light in color. Amino acid analysis by three different approaches total lysine, available lysine and free lysine bioassay showed a significant improvement Table 9 .Each was increased in all its forms in the bread protein. The available lysine was increased by 28.1 and 23.6t. A previous nutritive analysis of the improvedBaladi bread to test the bio availability of the bread proteins is presented in Table 19. A significant reduction of the flour protein quality resulted from the use of the natural, unimproved bacteria. The PER protein efficiency ratio and growth gain were lowered 17.7 and 27 respectively while the feed conversion rate increased 16.6 . The natural process for bakingBaladi bread using the natural bacteria gives a bread less nutritional value than the flour from which it is baked. Compared to the bread baked with the natural bacteria, the new lysine excreting bacteria gave a bread with improved nutritive value. The PER and growth gain were increased 24.6 and 36 respectively, and the conversion rate decreased 23 . The improved bacteria accomplished this by lysine excretion.
