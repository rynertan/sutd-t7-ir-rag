## Description
CATALYSTS USEFUL FOR PREPARING POLYAMIDES BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to new catalysts useful for the preparation of polyamides. More particularl this invention relates to the polymerization of at least one of an alpha, beta unsaturated. carboxylic acid and ammonia, an ammonium salt of an alpha, beta unsaturated carboxylic acid, an alpha, beta unsaturated nitrile and water. a beta amino Pronionic acid or icsEMI1.1 alkyl derivatives and an alpha beta unsaturated amid in the presence of a catalyst comprising a pentaammine cobalt III complex.. It is known that polyamides can be prepared from various monomers. For example, U.S. Patent 4,283,524 describes a process wherein poyamides are prepared from the ammonium salts of alpha, beta unsaturated monocarboxylic acids. U.S.Patent 2,691,643 teaches that polyamides can be prepared by the thermal condensation of beta amino propionic acid. U.S. Patents 3,629,203 and 3,499,879 relate to the preparation of polyamides by the condensation reaction of acrylonitrile. U.S. Patent 2,749,331 teaches that polyamides can be prepared from acrylamide. However, each of these processes is deficient in that the polymide produced has very low molecular weight. It is an object of this invention to provide a novel catalytic process to produce polyamides which have a high degree of polymerization. Moreover, by using catalyst system in the reaction, the rate of the polymerization reaction is remarkably increased and the reaction period is greatly shortened.

DETAILED DESCRIPTIONThe Polymer The polyamides obtained by the process of this invention are characterized as containing ethylene amido linkages in the polymer backbone. These ethylene amido linkages are generally defined as having repeating units as follows EMI2.2 wherein each R is a suitable substituent which, in the simplest embodiment of the invention, would all be hydrogen. These ethylene amido linkages comprise the basic structure of a nylon 3 type polyamide. These polyamides may also contain other carbonamide structural units. Tte carbonamide structural unit will vary depending on the particular monomer or monomers used in the polymerization. For example, the carbonamide unit mÅay,zomprise a nylon 6 type unit which has the following formula EMI2.3 wherein each R is a suitable substituent which, in the simplest embodiment of the invention, would all be hydrogen. Other carbonamide units such as nylon 4 precursors, nylon ll precursors, nylon 6,6 precursors, nylon 6,10 precursors, nylon 7 precursors, nylon 8 precursors and nylon 12 precursors may be contained in the polyamide of this invention.The properties of the resultant polyamide will depend on the type of monomer or monomers used and the ratio of the various monomers. While this invention is directed principally to polyamides, it also includes within its ambit polyamides the polymer chains of which are formed from the above units together with other units which may be introduced into the chain, for example, by adding suitable copolymerizable monomers to the polymerization mixture.The Process The formation of polyamides from alpha, beta unsaturated carboxylic acid and ammonia, ammonium salt of an alpha, beta unsaturated carboxylic acid, an alpha, beta unsaturated nitrile and water, a 1beta amino propionic acid or ,alkyl derivaEMI3.1 tives thereof and an alpha, beta unsaturated amidenare all known. Examples of carboxylic acids which are within the scope of this invention include acrylic acid, methacrylic acid and crotonic acid. Examples of ammonium salts of alpha, beta unsaturated carboxylic acids which are included within the scope of this invention are ammonium acrylate, ammonium methacrylate and ammonium crotonate.Examples of alpha, beta unsaturated nitriles which are within the scope of this invention include acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile. ExampLes of beta amino propionic acid or alkyl derivatives thereof which are within the scope of this invention include beta alanine and alpha methylbeta alanine. Examples of alpha, beta unsaturated amides that are within the scope of this invention include acrylamide and methacrylamide. Each of these reactions is well known in the art. This polymerization can be conducted under a broad range of process conditions which are generally known in the prior art. In the preferred practice of the invention a monomer or monomers are maintained at a temperature above their melting points but below the decomposition temperature of the products.It is generally preferred to conduct the process at a temperature between 100 andl300 C, and conducting tne process between 135 and 2000C is most preferred. The temperature and amount of time required for polymerization are interrelated. At low temperatures it will take longer for a polymer to form than at high temperatures. In general, the reaction is conducted in less than 48 hours, with times ranging from 2 to 20 hours normally being adequate to produce the polyamide. Although this polymerization can take place in an open container in contact with the atmosphere, it is preferred to carry out the polymerization in the absence of oxygen. This can be achieved by blanketing the reaction mixture with either an inert gas such as nitrogen or with a gaseous monomer, e.g.ammonia. This reaction can proceed at atmospheric, superatmospheric or subatmospheric pressure. Normally, sufficient pressure is required to maintain the volatile ingredients in the liquid state under the polymerization conditions and to control the concentration of gaseous ingredients. Thus, the polymerization normally takes place under superatmospheric pressure.After the polymerization has proceeded for a suitable time, the pressure can be lowered to pull off water and other volatiles. Another important factor in the conduct of the polymer ization is the extent two which the reactants are able to physically contact each other so that the desired reaction can occur. Various solvents and liquid dispersions are helpful in improving the contacting. It has also been found that ammonia and or water can be added to improve the conversion of the monomers to high molecular weight polymer. This polymerization process can proceed by any of the generally known modeslof polymerization including bulk, slurry, suspension or solucion polymerization by batch, continuous or intermittant addition of the monomers and other components. The polyamides produced have a wide variety of applications. Generally, they may be used in any application calling for a nylon type polymer. For example, these polyamides can be used as fibers, plastics, films and molding resins. The Catalyst The catalyst useful in the inventive process comprises a pentaammine cobalt III complex.
