# Semiconductor switch.

## Abstract
The optoelectronic switch includes a photosensitive GaAs FET 1 on to which an optical signal 11 may be directed. The optical signal 11 is derived from an RF modulated light source 12 . A voltage circuit 7 is connected to the FET 1 to switch the FET 1 on or off by placing a positive or zero voltage respectively on the drain. An isolation of over 70 dB is obtained in this FET switch.
