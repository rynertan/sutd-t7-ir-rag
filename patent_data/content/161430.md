# Shock absorber.

## Abstract
A hydraulic shock absorber including a piston 3 dis posed within a hollow cylinder in movable position respon sive to a shock applied thereto defines a hollow vortex chamber 9, 10 therein, said vortex chamber being com municated with fluid chambers defined in the hollow cylin der to introduce a working fluid and to generate a vortex pattern fluid flow therein for producing and absorbing force. Said piston 3 comprises upper and lower members assembled together for defining therein a vortex chamber 9, 10 , said upper and lower members being formed with vertically extending recesses 13 on the periphery thereof, the recesses formed in the upper and lower members being aligned with respect to one another and defining vertical vortex passages, said piston further defining vortex passages 11, 12 having inner ends tangentially opening into said vortex chamber and outer ends opening into said vertical vortex passages, said vortex chamber being divided in two upper and lower sections 9, 10 disposed within said vortex chamber, said upper and lower sections communi cating with each other via said vertical extending recesses 13 and vortex passages 11, 12 .
