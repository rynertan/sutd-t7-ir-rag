# Shielded ribbon cable.

## Abstract
A fully shielded flexible ribbon cable 10 having transmis sion line electrical characteristics and flexible ribbon cable mechanical characteristics capable of easy mass termina tion. The cable 10 has a plurality of circular uniformly spaced signal conductors 12 lying in a single plane encased in insulation 14 having an effectively uniform dielectric con stant of not more than 3.0. A sheet conductor 16 is bonded to the insulation 14 providing both transverse and longitudinal electrical continuity. The ratio of the diameter 26 of the signal conductors 12 to the distance 24 between centers of the signal conductors 12 is between 0.16 and 0.42. The ratio between the thickness 22 of the cable 10 at the inner surface of the sheet conductor 16 to the distance 24 between centers of the signal conductors 12 is not more than 1.5.
