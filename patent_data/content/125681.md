# AN APPARATUS FOR FORMING LEAK PROOF JOINTS BETWEEN TUBES AND TUBE SHEET

## Abstract
In an apparatus for forming leak proof joints between tubes and a tube sheet by the internal application of hyd raulic swaging pressure, the flow of relatively low pressure fluid from a pressure source 10 to an intensifier 42 is per mitted or interrupted by a control valve 40 . During a prefill period, a prefill valve 44 causes the low pressure fluid to bypass the low pressure input side of the intensifier and to flow directly to the high pressure side and then to a mandrel 49 . After a predetermined period to allow prefilling of the mandrel and associated tube portions, the low pressure fluid is caused to enter the low pressure side of the intensifier which operates to increase the pressure in the mandrel dur ing a swaging period.
