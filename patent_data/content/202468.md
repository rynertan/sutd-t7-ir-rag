This invention further relates to a method for determining a position of a radiation source according to the first part of claim 33. Systems are known for determining the position or location of an object within a defined area. Such systems find utility for the entry of graphic and other information into a computer, and are often embodied into a data entry tablet which includes means for sensing the position of a stylus or other point movable within a defined area, and for providing an electrical signal which is representative of successive stylus positions, thereby to denote lines, curves and figures drawn by the stylus on the tablet. Another known use for position determining systems is for land surveying and wherein means are provided for sensing the position of a target movable within a defined area, and for providing a signal representative of the sensed target positions and from which survey information can be derived. A related data entry device is known as a cursor controller or mouse , which is usually in the form of a small housing movable over a surface and which provides corresponding movement of a cursor on a display screen. Movement of the cursor can be employed for data entry of graphical information and can also be used as a pointer for identifying a position on the screen or information displayed on the screen, such as for interactive computer usage. In general, mouse movement is provided by a ball that rolls over a surface, the ball movement being sensed by mechanical or optical means. Motion can also be sensed via a specially prepared sensible surface over which the mouse is moved. For example, a checkerboard pattern has been employed on a surface, and light reflected from the surface is detected by a photodetector which provides pulse signals indicative of motion with respect to the surface pattern. A review of several different types of mouse cursor controllers is provided in an article entitled Interfacing Mice to Computers , Graphic input devices are known using pairs of scanned light beams, as shown, for example, in U.S. Patents 3,553,680 3,613,066 3,364,389 and 4,294,543. In this type of entry device, first and second narrow light beams are scanned across a surface and means are provided for sensing the light beams at intersecting points. within the surface, the angular position of the two beams at the detected intersections representing the position within the defined area. Another known technique employs orthogonal light beams provided across a display surface, the interruption of selected orthogonal pairs of beams providing an identification of the data entry point. Examples of surveying and related systems for automatic position determination are shown in U.S. Patents 3,714,657 3,400,398 3,437,825 and 3,443,095. Range measuring systems are shown for example in U.S. Patents 2,830,487 3,759,614 and 3,961,851. From US A 4,470,122 an integrated electro optical position sensing apparatus is known which utilizes driven sensors to scan the area of interest. The sensors are scanned in reciprocating, arcuate scanning paths orientated to scan across the position of a radation emitting module. The driven sensors are connected to a common vertically journalled shaft and driven by drive motors which are also connected to this shaft. The sensors are positioned within the interior of a housing that includes stationary sensor windows that are elongated in the lengthwise dimension and position, so as to be in general registration with the arcuate scanning movements of the sensors. Each sensor consists of a transducer rigidly secured to a light channelling shroud having a slot. The transducer light channelling shroud combination is driven by the drive motors. The sensors themselves are driven to scan a predefined area. From US A 4,209,254, a system is known, wherein a set of radiation emitting sources are disposed on a movable object and sequentially activated to determine the line of light of the movable object. It is an object of the invention to improve the accuracy of the state of the art apparatus and method.

The system may be implemented for purposes of data entry or for purposes of object location or surveying. When embodied in a data entry tablet, the invention provides signals representative of the positions of a stylus movable within the area of the tablet and comprising first and second photodetectors spaced along a base line by a predetermined distance, and means associated with each photodetector and operative to provide a movable narrow field of view for each photodetector. Means are provided for monitoring the angular position of each of the fields of view with respect to the base line and for providing a signal indication of the respective angular positions. A stylus having a light emitter at the tip thereof is movable within the area of the tablet and provides light detectable by each of the photodetectors. Each of the photodetectors provides a respective signal when the field of view of the corresponding photodetector receives light from the emitter. Means are provided which is operative in response to the signal indication of the angular position of each of the movable means at which light from the emitter is respectively detected to provide a signal representing the position of the emitter within the area of the tablet. In one presently preferred embodiment, a rotating cylinder is provided for each photodetector, the cylinder having a slit providing a narrow field of view or line of sight which is rotatable at a constant and known angular velocity. The time of rotation of each of the cylinders is monitored with respect to a start or reference position such that the time elapsed between the start position and the time at which light from the emitter is detected by each of the photodetectors is known. The elapsed time is a measure of the angular position of the rotating cylinder with respect to the detected position of the emitter and from this angular information, the position of the emitter with respect to the detectors is readily determined by known geometrical relations. Alternatively, the angular position of each of the rotating cylinders can be determined by use of respective shaft angle encoders which provide signal indications of the rotational position of the respective cylinders and therefore the respective fields of view. In this latter instance, angular position is measured directly, and the rotational velocity of the fields of view need not be constant or known. The rotatable field of view can be provided by other means such as an opaque shield rotatably movable around each detector and operative to occlude light from the light source when in the line of sight between the source and the detector. A timing cycle can be commenced by the sensed change in received light upon passage of the leading or trailing edge of the shield. The moving field of view can also be provided by a linearly movable silt or other view limiting shield. In another embodiment, a single photodetector is employed and is rotatable about an axis and operative to detect light from a source movable within a defined area at each of two predetermined positions in the path of rotation. The position of the light source in relation to the detector positions is then determined. In an alternative embodiment, a pair of light emitters is provided along a straight edge which is movable within the tablet area and the position of each of the emitters is determined in the manner described above to provide an indication of the position of the straight edge within the tablet area. Additional commands can be provided in conjunction with the position data of the emitter or emitters to provide data corresponding with the position of the stylus or straight edge at intended portions of the tablet area. The invention will be more fully understood from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which Referring to Figs. 1 and 2, there is shown a data tablet having a defined area 10 within which a stylus 11 is movable. The stylus has a light emitter 13 such as a light emitter diode LED on the tip thereof. It should be understood, however, that the light provided by emitter 13 is not limited to light having a frequency in the visible range, and, in fact may preferably have a frequency in the infrared frequency range. First and second photodetectors 12 and 14 are provided along an edge of the tablet, the detectors being spaced apart by a predetermined distance L which defines a known base line. A pair of opaque cylinders 16 and 18 are provided around respective photodetectors 12 and 14, each of the cylinders having a respective slit 20 and 22, axially provided thereon to provide a narrow field of view or line of sight for light receivable by the respective photodetectors from the emitter 13. Each of the cylinders is rotatable by suitable motive means such as respective electric motors. The angular position of each of the rotating cylinders is determined, in one embodiment, by measurement of the elapsed time of rotation of each of the cylinders with respect to a start or zero reference position. As illustrated in Fig. 3, a start position for each of the cylinders is defined by a fiducial mark 28 on the cylinder and which is sensed by sensor 29 to produce a signal which causes a clock counter in processing logic 30 Fig. 5 to be started to provide a count representative of the angular position of the associated rotating cylinder with respect to the start position. The processing logic 30 also receives the outputs from photodetectors 12 and 14. The time elapsed between the start position and the time at which light from the emitter is detected by each of the photodetectors is determined by logic 30 by use of known geometrical relationships. The elapsed time is a measure of the angular position of the rotating cylinders with respect to the detected position of the emitter and, from this angular information, the position of the emitter with respect to the detectors is readily determined. The logic 30 provides an output signal representative of the position of the emitter within the tablet area, and this signal can be provided to a display or other utilization apparatus. An alternative embodiment is illustrated in Fig. 4 in which the angular position of each of the rotating cylinders is directly provided. Referring to Fig. 4, a shaft angle encoder is coupled to the cylinder 16, the encoder being operative to provide a signal representative of the rotational position of the associated cylinder. The encoder comprises an encoder disc 34 attached to and rotatable with the cylinder, and a light sensor 36 operative to receive light from source 38 which is directed through the disc 34. The sensor 36 provides signals which represent the rotation of the disc and cylinder 16. The encoder signals are employed by logic 30 in association with the photodetector signals to calculate the position of the emitter in relation to the detectors. A further embodiment is illustrated in Fig. 6 in which a pair of light emitters 40 and 42 is provided in spaced relation along a straight edge which is movable within the tablet area. In the illustrated embodiment, the light emitters 40 and 42 are provided on a template 44 which is movable within the tablet area. The position of each of the emitters is determined in the manner described above to provide an indication of the straight edge defined by the spaced emitters within the area of the tablet. The template can include a standard frame into which various template sheets are insertable, each providing symbols and forms as desired. It may be desirable to distinguish between the respective emitters 40 and 42. This can be accomplished in several different ways, including the employment of different frequencies of light emission by the respective emitters, or by pulsing the emitters at different rates. If such coding of the light emissions is employed, the circuitry associated with the light sensors will include means for distinguishing between the respective light emissions. In addition to the entry of the position of a stylus point or an edge and the display of such point or edge positions, additional information can be entered for display in association with the positional data or for other associated use. For example, characters such as numbers, letters and symbols 46 can be provided on the template 44 of Fig. 6 and such items can be displayed in association with the position and orientation of the defined edge by entry of such items. Such date entry can be, for example, by means of an optical pen 48 for selecting characters. Once the orientation of the defined edge or orientation of the template is known, in the manner described above, the position of each symbol, number or letter within the template is also known and can be readily entered into a data system for display such as by optical pen or other known means. In the above embodiments, each detector has a rotating slit associated therewith for defining the respective narrow field of view. A further embodiment is shown in Fig. 7, which depicts a pair of detectors 49 each having a transparent cylinder 50 disposed therearound with an opaque segment 52 on the cylinder. Each of the detectors can be similarly embodied as illustrated in Fig. 8. The detectors receive light from the light source 13 at all times except when temporarily occluded by the interposition of the opaque shield in the light path. The line of sight between the light source and detector can be specified at the leading edge or trailing edge of the moving shield. The arcuate length of the shield can be of any extent less than 360 . During the interval at which the shield occludes the light, the clock counters can be reset for the next timing cycle. In operation, a start signal can be provided as the leading edge of the shield enters the light path, causing a change in the sensed light, and a timing interval commenced for that rotational cycle of the cylinder. Alternatively, the passage of the trailing edge of the shield out of the light path can signify the commencement of a timing cycle. The moving field of view can be otherwise coordinated with the detector and need not be by a rotating field of view, as described above. In the embodiment of Fig. 9, an opaque shield 54 is provided having a slit 56 therein. The shield being linearly movable in reciprocating fashion past the associated detector. Each detector includes a similar reciprocating shield. The line of sight between each detector and the light source is determined by the alignment of the respective slits with the respective light paths. In the embodiment of Fig. 10, a rotating mirror 58 is employed to direct light from the light source 13 to the photodetector 49. Upon alignment of the reflecting surface 60 of the rotating mirror with the incident light, light is directed to the detector to specify the line of sight for the position determining computation. Another mirror implementation is shown in Fig. 11, in which the mirror 62 is rotatable about the axis, and upon alignment of the reflecting surface 64 with the incident light, light is reflected to the detector 49, which in this implementation is top mounted such as on a support arm 66. A further embodiment is illustrated in Fig. 12 in which a single photodetector 49a is employed. A pair of fiber optic cables 68 are provided, each coupling light from a respective sensing position to the single detector. The outer end 70 of each fiber optic cable 68 is disposed to receive light from the light source 13 as selectively provided by the moving field of view, such as a rotating cylinder 72 having a slit thereon, as in the embodiment of Fig. 3 described above. Other means can be provided for transmitting or reflecting light received from the respective light sensing positions to the single photodetector, such as a mirror or mirror assembly. The inner end 74 of each fiber optic cable is in light coupling relation to detector 49a. It will be appreciated that the embodiments discussed above may be designed for use in land surveying but are more suitable for use with data entry tablets. However, the embodiment of the invention shown in Figs. 13 and 14 is especially suited for land surveying. A single photodetector 49b is mounted on the end of a boom 80 having a counterweight 82 at the other end thereof, the boom being mounted for rotation on a tripod 84 or other suitable support, and rotated at a known velocity by means of a motor 86. A light source 13a is provided at the point remote from the detector, the light from this source being detectable by the single detector at each of two positions, as illustrated in Fig. 14. In the illustrated embodiment, the positions are shown at diametrically opposite positions of a rotary cycle. A narrow field of view for the detector is provided by any convenient means, such as a rotating slit as described above. Thus, a line of sight between the light source and each light sensing position of the detector is specified, and the position of the light source then determined. A smaller version of this single detector embodiment can also be employed for data tablet or other data entry purposes. In all the embodiments discussed heretofore, it is assumed that there is a clear line of sight between the light source and the two light receiving locations. This would usually be the case with data entry tablets of the type described, where the selected area is always located on one side of the base line which extends between the two selected light receiving locations. However, in applications where the selected area to be monitored completely surrounds the base line extending between the two light receiving locations, or where there may not always be a clear line of sight between the light source and both of the light receiving locations such as in land surveying where the line of sight might be blocked by a tree or other non movable objects , complete surveillance of the selected area may not be possible. Therefore, according to another embodiment such as diagrammatically illustrated in Fig. 15, a third light receiving location may be provided to assure complete surveillance of the area. In the illustration of Fig. 15, those elements which are the same as elements shown in the embodiment of Fig. 2, carry common reference numbers. As shown, a first base line L₁ is defined by light receiving diodes 12 and 14 which scan selected area 88 extending on both sides of base line L₁ as indicated by light pen 11A and 11B on the right side and light pen 11C on the left side. Normally almost all locations in the select area 88 would satisfactorily be scanned by light receiving diodes 12 and 14 such that the position of a light source could readily be determined. However in the event an object 89 which is opaque to light source 11B was located so as to block the line of sight between light pen 11B and light receiving diode 14 which line of sight is represented by line segments 90 and 92 . The light receiving diode 12 would not have an input to help determine the location of light pen 11B, and consequently the location of light pen 11B along the line of sight 94 could not be determined. However, according to the embodiment of the present invention shown in Fig. 15, there is also included a third light receiving diode 96 which is located at a known position and distance with respect to base line L₁. As is also clear from the illustration of Fig. 15, there are secondary base lines L₂ and L₃ established between the light receiving diodes 12 and 96, and 14 and 96 respectively. Consequently, the position of light pen 11B may readily be determined by processing the information from light receiving diode 12 and 96 with respect to base line L₂ in the same manner as the information from light receiving diode 12 and 14 was processed with respect to base line L₁. In a similar manner, if the line of sight between the light source and light receiving diode 12 is blocked, information from light receiving diode 14 and light receiving diode 96 may be used with respect to base line L₃ to determine the position of the light source. A third light receiving diode would also be necessary if the light source were to lie along an extension of a base line extending between two light receiving diodes even if there was no blockage of light paths. For example as shown in Fig. 15 light pen 11A lies along an extension of L₃ and consequently, it is impossible to determine the distance of the light source from either light receiving diode 14 or light receiving diode 96. However, in this example the location of light pen 11A may readily be determined by processing the information received from light receiving diode 12 and light receiving diode 96 with respect to base line L₂. Light pen source 11C is included to illustrate that the surveillance area or selected area completely surround the light receiving locations. Furthermore, although the light receiving diode 12, 14 and 96 are arranged in Fig. 15 so as to form an equilateral triangle to simplify the processing of data or calculations, the three locations of the light receiving diodes could form a right triangle or any other irregular triangle so long as the location and distance of rich light receiving diode is known with respect to every other light receiving diode. This invention is not to be limited by what has been particularly shown and described except as indicated in the appended claims.
