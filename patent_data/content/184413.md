## Description
This invention relates to an improved process for producing chlorine by oxidizing hydrogen chloride with an oxygen containing gas in the presence of a catalyst at a low temperature and in a gas phase. Chlorine is produced on a large scale by the electrolysis of sodium chloride. In spite of the ever increasing demand for chlorine, the demand for caustic soda which occurs simultaneously upon the electrolysis of sodium chloride is lower than that for chlorine. Difficulties have thus been encountered in meeting their different demands appropriately. On the other hand, a great deal of hydrogen chloride is obtained as the by product of the chlorination or phosgenation reaction of an organic compound. Since the volume of this hydrogen chloride is significantly higher than the demand level for hydrochloric acid, lots of hydrogen chloride is disposed of wastefully without its utilization. Furthermore, the treatment cost for its disposal has reached a considerable value. It is thus possible to meet the demand for chlorine without developing an imbalance between its production level and that of caustic soda, provided that chlorine can be efficiently recovered from hydrogen chloride which is disposed of in a large volume as described above. The reaction in which hydrogen chloride is oxidized to produce chlorine has been known as the Deacon reaction for many years. The copper based catalysts which Deacon invented in 1868 have conventionally been considered to show the best activities. A number of proposals have been made on catalysts which contain various compounds added as a third component to copper chloride and potassium chloride. In order to oxidize hydrogen chloride at an industrially satisfactory reaction rate with these catalysts, it is however necessary to raise the reaction temperature to 450 C or higher. At such a high reaction temperature, a problem arises that their catalytic service life is shortened due to scattering of their catalyst components. In addition, the oxidation reaction of hydrogen chloride has an equilibrium point. The yield of chlorine decreases as the temperature goes up. It is thus required to develop a catalyst which possesses activity at a temperature which is as low as possible. From the above described viewpoint, iron based catalysts and some other catalysts have been proposed as catalysts other than copper based catalysts. However, the present inventors are still not aware of any catalysts which may exhibit qualities and performances for practical industrial use. It has also been proposed to employ chromium oxide as a catalyst for the oxidation of hydrogen chloride because chromium oxide has better stability and durability at elevated temperatures than copper and the like. As far as the present inventors are aware of, none of such chromium oxide catalysts have yet been reported to have shown satisfactory activities. For example, it is disclosed in U.K. Patent Specification No. 584,790 that hydrogen chloride is caused to flow at about 400 C over a catalyst, which has been prepared by impregnating a suitable carrier with chromic anhydride or an aqueous solution of chromium nitrate and then subjecting the thus impregnated carrier to pyrolysis, to produce chlorine and after deactivation of the catalyst, the supply of hydrogen chloride is cut off and air is in turn caused to flow so as to regenerate the catalyst, and the supply of air is then stopped and the supply of hydrogen chloride is instead resumed. In U.K. Patent Specification No. 676,667, hydrogen chloride and an oxygen containing gas were reacted at 420 430 C in the presence of a catalyst composed of a carrier and a bichromate or heavily dark green chromium oxide supported on the carrier, whereby hydrogen chloride conversions of 67.4 and 63 , both based on the equilibrium value, were achieved at hourly space velocities of 380 hr ¹ and 680 hr respectively. The occurrence of the reaction was still observed at 340 C. However, the hourly space velocity was controlled at such a low level as 65 hr ¹ and the resultant conversion was as low as 52 . As mentioned above, even when chromium oxide is used as a catalyst, it is not of such quality that it can withstand an industrial operation because the reaction temperature is high and the hourly space velocity is low in each of such conventional processes. In other words, the chromium oxide catalysts which have conventionally been reported are not believed to exhibit any specifically excellent performance compared with the copper based catalysts. It is desirable to provide a process for recovering chlorine from hydrogen chloride with good efficiency by using a catalyst which is active at low temperatures and permits the oxidation of hydrogen chloride at a large volume rate. The present inventors have carried out research on the production of chlorine by the oxidation of hydrogen chloride, especially, on catalysts useful in the oxidation of hydrogen chloride. As a result, it has been found that chlorine can be produced from hydrogen chloride at a higher rate and with a conversion significantly higher than those achieved by conventional processes when a chromium oxide catalyst prepared in accordance with a process, which has not been reported heretofore with respect to the oxidation of hydrogen chloride, is used. In one aspect of this invention, there is thus provided a process for producing chlorine by oxidizing hydrogen chloride with an oxygen containing gas, which comprises effecting the oxidation in the presence of a catalyst prepared from a chromium compound which has been obtained by reacting chromium nitrate, chromium chloride or the chromium salt of an organic acid with ammonia. In another aspect of this invention, there is also provided a process for producing chlorine by oxidizing hydrogen chloride with an oxygen containing gas, which comprises effecting the oxidation in the presence of a catalyst prepared from a chromium compound, which has been obtained by reacting a chromium salt with ammonia, and a silicon compound. The catalyst may preferably be used after calcining same at a temperature lower than 800 C. As mentioned above, the present invention makes it possible to produce chlorine from hydrogen chloride at a rate and with a conversion which are significantly higher than those available by conventional processes. As hydrogen chloride useful as a raw material in the practice of the process of this invention, it is generally possible to make wide use of byproduct hydrochloric acid such as that produced upon chlorination of organic compounds or that produced by the reaction between phosgene and organic compounds. The oxygen containing gas is used as an oxidizing agent for hydrogen chloride. Oxygen gas or air may be used in many instances. Oxygen gas may preferably used where the reactor is of the fluidized bed type, whereas air may favorably be used where the reactor is of the fixed bed type. As the molar ratio of hydrogen chloride to the oxygen in an oxygen containing gas, which are both to be fed for the reaction, the oxygen is preferably used in an amount of about 1 4 mole equivalent or so per mole of hydrogen chloride. In many instances, oxygen is generally used 5 200 in excess of its equivalent. It is suitable to feed hydrochloric acid to a catalyst bed at a flow rate in the range of 200 1800 Nℓ hr kgCat. As the reaction temperature, 300 400 C or particularly 330 390 C are employed frequently. A pressure range of from normal pressure or so to 1 11 kg cm² 1.078 x 10⁸ pascal is often used as the reaction pressure. The conversion of hydrogen chloride increases as the pressure becomes higher. The catalyst useful in the practice of the process of this invention is obtained from a chromium compound which has been formed by reacting a chromium salt, which was obtained through the reaction between chromium nitrate, chromium chloride, the chromium salt of an organic acid or chromic anhydride and hydrogen chloride, with ammonia. It is preferred to calcine the chromium compound at a temperature lower than 800 C prior to its application. Alternatively, the catalyst may also be prepared from the above described chromium compound, which has been obtained by reacting the chromium salt with ammonia, and a silicon compound. It is preferable to calcine the mixture of the chromium compound and silicon compound at a temperature lower than 800 C. The chromium compound can usually be formed by reacting an aqueous solution of the above described chromium salt with aqueous ammonia. It may also be feasible to use an ammonia releasing compound, such as urea, in place of ammonia. Generally, the amounts of such chromium salts in water fall in the range of 3 30 wt. . It is usually suitable to use aqueous ammonia the NH₄OH concentration of which ranges from 5 to 30 . The resulting precipitate is collected by filtration, washed and then dried. Thereafter, it is preferably calcined at a temperature lower than 800 C for several to 20 hours or so in an air atmosphere, in vacuo or in an inert gas atmosphere such as nitrogen gas atmosphere to obtain a catalyst. After the calcination, the resultant catalyst is shaped by the tableting or extrusion method so that it can be used in a fixed bed reactor. To prepare a catalyst suitable for use in a fluidized bed, the resultant precipitate is washed by decantation and is then converted into a slurry of a suitable concentration. In a spray drier, the slurry is formed into particles and then dried there. Thereafter, the thus obtained particles are preferably calcined at a temperature lower than 800 C to obtain a catalyst. It is essential to use chromium nitrate, chromium chloride, the chromium salt of an organic acid, or a salt which is obtained by the reaction of chromic anhydride and hydrogen chloride, as the starting material for the chromium compound employed in the process of this invention. It is also an essential requirement to use ammonia as an alkaline material for allowing the precipitate to occur. When chromium sulfate, basic chromium sulfate, chromic acid, a bichromate or the like is used, it is impossible to obtain a catalyst of high activity and performance even if ammonia is used as a precipitant. On the other hand, use of a caustic alkali such as caustic soda or caustic potassium or an alkali carbonate such as sodium carbonate or sodium bicarbonate as a precipitant makes it impossible to obtain any highly active catalyst even if chromium nitrate or chromium chloride is used. Similarly, it is impossible to obtain a highly active catalyst from chromium oxide which has been obtained by subjecting chromium nitrate, chromic anhydride or commercial chromium hydroxide to pyrolysis. It is preferable to maintain the calcination temperature of the catalyst at a level lower than 800 C. If a catalyst is calcined at a temperature of 800 C or higher, its catalytic activity may be reduced sharply. Although no particular limitation is imposed on the lower limit of the calcination temperature, it is generally preferable to effect its calcination at least at a temperature where the oxidation reaction of hydrogen chloride is carried out. In many instances, the calcination is conducted by loading the dried precipitate in a separate calcination furnace. However, the calcination treatment may also be effected simultaneously with the reaction in a tubular reactor employed for the reaction. The following methods may be followed to prepare the catalyst composed of the chromium compound and silicon compound. 1 A silicon compound, e.g., ethyl silicate is mixed in advance in an aqueous solution of the above mentioned chromium salt. The resultant aqueous mixture is then reacted with ammonia, whereby chromium hydroxide and silicon hydroxide are co precipitated. 2 Silica sol is mixed to an aqueous solution of the aforementioned chromium salt, followed by an addition of ammonia to form a precipitate. 3 The precipitate obtained from the above mentioned chromium salt and ammonia is mixed and kneaded with a silica sol such as colloidal silica or fine silica particles in the presence of water. The thus kneaded mass is air dried at room temperature in a usual manner, dried at 80 120 C and then calcined into a catalyst. The mixed slurry of the chromium precipitate and the silicon compound may be formed into fine spherical particles and then dried in a spray drier. They may then be calcined to obtain a catalyst suitable for use in a fluidized bed. A mixed paste of the chromium precipitate and silicon compound may be extruded, dried and then calcined to obtain a catalyst suitable for use in a fixed bed. As a still further alternative, the above mentioned compound obtained in the reaction of the chromium salt and ammonia may be washed, dried and optionally calcined. It may then be mixed with a silicon compound, for example, silica sol, silica gel, a silicic acid ester or the like. The resulting mixture may then be dried and optionally calcined again to obtain a catalyst. Here, the chromium and silicon compounds may be formed into a mixed slurry, which is then dried by spray drier. The resultant catalyst is suitable for use in a fluidized bed. On the other hand, the mixture of the chromium compound and silicon compound may be extruded to form a catalyst suitable for use in a fixed bed. No particular limitation is generally imposed on the mixing ratio of chromium to silica. Expressing it in terms of the weight ratio of Cr₂O₃ to SiO₂ in the final product obtained eventually subsequent to the calcination of each catalyst, Cr₂O₃ SiO₂ may often range from 30 70 to 95 5. The principal effect, which can be brought about from the addition of silica, resides in an increase to the mechanical strength of a catalyst, particularly, in an increase to the attrition resistance of a catalyst which has been formed into fine particles for use in a fluidized bed. When chromic anhydride is used as a starting material for the catalyst, a catalyst is prepared by reacting chromic anhydride with hydrogen chloride in the following manner and then reacting the resultant reaction mixture further with ammonia in such a manner as mentioned above. The reaction is carried out by adding and reacting chromic anhydride CrO₃ to an aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid or blowing hydrogen chloride gas into an aqueous solution of chromic anhydride dissolved in water. The reaction between chromic anhydride and hydrogen chloride is suitably effected in a temperature range of from room temperature to 100 C. As to the proportions of chromic anhydride and hydrogen chloride to be required, hydrogen chloride may generally be used in an amount of 6 20 moles as HCℓ per mole of CrO₃. The time required for the reaction may range from 10 minutes to 20 hours. Ammonia is thereafter added into the above described aqueous solution, whereby the pH of the aqueous solution is brought to the vicinity of the neutral level to precipitate a chromium compound. The thus obtained precipitate is treated in the same manner as the above mentioned process either as is or as a mixture with a silicon compound. According to the process of this invention, it is possible to treat hydrogen chloride in a volume much greater than conventional processes, namely, an hourly HCℓ space velocity of 700 1800 hr ¹ at a temperature lower than those employed in the conventional processes, namely, at a temperature of 300 360 C or so. Moreover, the thus achieved conversion reaches 100 of the equilibrium conversion. In other words, the present invention can achieve a high conversion of hydrogen chloride at a volume rate much higher than any conventionally known catalyst systems. Therefore, the present invention has provided an industrially advantageous production process of chlorine, which permits efficient production of chlorine from hydrogen chloride. The present invention will hereinafter be described by the following Examples. Dissolved in 3 ℓ of deionized water was 300 g of chromium nitrate nonahydrate. While thoroughly stirring the resultant solution, 285 g of 28 aqueous solution of ammonia was added dropwise over 10 minutes.

In a fluidized calcination furnace, the powder was calcined at 600 C for 3 hours in a fluidized state while feeding air. A fraction of the catalyst, which fraction ranges from 100 150 mesh U.S. Sieve Series, i.e. 149 97 µm in particular size, was collected by sieving.
