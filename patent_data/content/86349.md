# Display device.

## Abstract
In a display device having, at least, picture elements which are arrayed on a transparent insulating substrate and transistor portions 23 26 which are formed of a semi conductor layer 21 formed on the transparent insulating substrate a display device characterized in that, at least, interconnection parts of the transistor portions extend on the semiconductor layer formed on the transparent insulat ing substrate. The disconnection of the interconnection parts can be avoided.
