# Process for the catalytic conversion of carbon monoxide and sulfactive CO conversion catalyst.

## Abstract
A process is disclosed for the conversion of carbon monoxide in sour synthesis gas mixtures in the presence of a catalyst which is active in the presence of sulfur compounds. The catalyst comprises known sulfactive metal oxides or sulfides supported on a shaped carrier. The catalytically active oxides or sulfides are doubly promoted with an alkali metal compound and an oxide or sulfide of a multivalent metal of Period 4 including titanium, vanadium, chromium and manganese. The two promoters provide a synergistic effect on the activity of the catalyst. The catalysts are active at relatively low temperatures of less than 260 C even in the presence of sulfur compounds. The equilibrium for the conversion of steam and carbon monoxide to hydrogen and COâ‚‚ is favored at lower temperatures.
