# Apparatus for controlling discharge of flowable material from a store thereof, such as a silo.

## Abstract
The invention relates to apparatus 1 for controlling discharge from a store thereof such as a silo 4, the apparatus 1 including a conical device 2 which supports on its undersurface a vibrator 7 and which is itself supported via isolators 11 on cross beam 10. The maximum diameter of the free edge of the device 2 is less than the internal diameter of an opening 3 from the silo 4 and defines with that opening an annular flow path 9 through which material not shown above the device 2 flows when the vibrator 7 is vibrated, as vibrating the device 2 to initiate flow of material through the path 9.
