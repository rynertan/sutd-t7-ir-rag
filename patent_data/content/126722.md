# PLANT FOR PROCESSING ORGANIC MATERIAL

## Abstract
A plant for processing organic material 18 which con tains liquid and solid phases 19, 20 , has a separator 6 for separation of the contaminated liquid and solid phases 19, 20 from one another, the contaminated liquid phase 19 being conducted to a recirculator 52 connected to an anaer obic filter 30 for purification of the contaminated liquid phase 19 . In addition to the contaminated liquid phase 19 the recirculator 52 also receives the liquid phase 41 puri fied in the anaerobic filter 30 , so that the contaminated liq uid phase 19 and the purified liquid phase 41 are mixed in desired proportions for introduction into the filter 30 . The remainder of the purified liquid phase 41 is withdrawn and can be conducted to say a recipient. The contaminated solid phase 20 is conducted from the separator 6 to a biogas reactor and after stabilisation to a thickener drier for conver sion into a sludge 77 which is useful for landfilling, deposi tion, composting, fertilizing and like purposes. The liquid 78 remaining in the thickener drier is conducted to the recir culator 52 for admixture with the mixture 40 . The biogas 45, 73 generated in the anaerobic filter 30 and the biogas reactor, respectively, is collected for use.
