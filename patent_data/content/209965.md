# Metering valve.

## Abstract
A metering valve has a one piece bonnet 30 for reducing problems resulting from tolerance stack up. A guide portion 62 on the nose of the bonnet co operates with a bore 20 in a valve body 12 to ensure concentric alignment between the metering pin 24 and its associated orifice 18 . A pair of O rings 72, 74 on the valve stem 26 co operate with the bonnet bore 28 to absorb forces and substantially reduce the potential for galling and breakage of the metering pin. One 72 of the O rings is compressed to a substantially greater extent than the other 74 to aid in achieving better alignment between the stem 26 and the bonnet 30 , and to obtain a firmer feel. A handle 34 at the outer end of the valve stem 26 receives an upper portion of the valve bonnet 30 . A packing 116, Figure 4 is interposed between the handle 86 and the upper portion of the valve bonnet 30 for limiting lateral movement between the handle and the valve stem. The packing may be selectively adjusted without alter ing a preset deadstop position of the valve.
