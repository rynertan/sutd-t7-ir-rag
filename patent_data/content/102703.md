# DOUBLE POLE MEMBRANE SWITCH HAVING PREFERRED SEQUENCE CLOSING FEATURE

## Abstract
Membrane switch 2 has opposed surfaces 16, 18 . One surface 16 has two contacts 26, 28 thereon and the other surface 18 has one contact 50 thereon. When switch is closed, all three contacts 26, 28, 50 are commonly con nected. The other surface 18 also has an electrically isolated commoning contact 58 thereon which ensures that the one contact 50 on the other surface 18 will be connected to the two contacts 26, 28 on the one surface 16 in a predeter mined order when the switch 2 is closed.
