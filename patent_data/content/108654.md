## Description
SULFONIC ACID COMPOUND HAVING CYCLOPENTADIENE SKELETON AND COMPOSITION COMPRISING SAME AND CEMENT This invention relates to a compound having a cyclopentadiene skeleton and at least one sulfonic acid group. In general, sulfonic acid and its derivatives, which are organic compounds, are strong acids comparable with sulfuric acid, and are industrially used in a wide field taking advantage of their properties. And their salts are water soluble and hence very important as surfactants for organic or inorganic materials. However, many of sulfonation products which have heretofore been synthesized are those of aromatic or aliphatic compounds1 and substantially no sulfonation products of alicyclic compounds are known. TheFrèsent inventors have conducted extensive research on sulfonation products obtained by using alicyclic compounds and their derivatives as starting materials to find that compounds having a cyclopentadiene skeleton and at least one sulfonic acid group can be produced, and that the obtained compounds or their salts are water soluble, and hence have an excellent surface active effect on organic and inorganic materials and have a particularly excellent effect on the dispersing of cement in water. According to this invention, there is provided a compound having a cyclopentadiene skeleton and at least one sulfonic acid group and is also provided a composition comprising the same and cement. The compound having a cyclopentadiene skeleton and at least one sulfonic acid group include the following 1 Sulfonation products of polymers of cyclopentadiene derivatives represented by the formula A or B EMI2.1 wherein R1 is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms,EMI2.2 wherein R2 and R3, which may be the same or different, represent hydrogen atoms or alkyl groups having 1 to 3 carbon atoms. 2 Sulfonation products obtained by sulfonating a reaction mixture prepared by reacting a cyclopentadiene derivative represented by the formula A or B with a compound represented by the formula C EMI2.3 wherein R4 and R5, which may be the same or different, represent hydrogen atoms or alkyl groups having 1 to 6 carbon atoms. 3 Condensates obtained by condensing in the presence of an aldehyde a sulfonation product prepared by sulfonating a reaction mixture obtained by reacting a cyclopentadiene derivative represented by the formula A or B with a compound represented by the formula C . 4 Condensates obtained by condencing in the presence of an aldehyde a sulfonated cyclopentadiene derivative represented by the formula D EMI3.1 wherein R2, R3, R4 and R5 are the same as defined above R6 is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and R4, R5 and R6 may be the same as or different from one another M is hydrogen, an alkali metal, an alkaline earth metal, ammonium or an amine and n is 1 or 2 and when M is an alkaline earth metal atom n is 2. 5 Disulfonated cyclopentadiene derivatives represented by the formula E EMI4.1 wherein R7 and R8, which may be the same or different, represent hydrogen atoms or alkyl groups having 1 or 2 carbon atoms and M is the same as defined above and m is 1 or 2 and when M is an alkaline earth metal m is 1. 6 Condensates obtained by condensing a disulfonated dicyclopentadiene derivative represented by the formula E in the presence of an aldehyde. 7 Sulfonated dicyclopentadienes represented by the formula F EMI4.2 wherein M and n are the same as defined in the formula D . 8 Polymers or copolymers of sulfonated dicyclopentadienes represented by the formula F . 9 Sulfonated hydroxydicyclopentadienes represented by the formula G EMI4.3 wherein M and n are the same as defined above. 10 Polymers or copolymers of sulfonated hydroxydicyclopentadienes represented by the formula G . Concrete examples of cyclopentadiene derivatives represented by the formula A or B used in the above sulfonation products 1 and 2 include, for instance, cyclopentadiene alkylcyclopentadienes such as methylcyclopentadiene, ethylcyclopentadiene, propylcyclopentadiene and the like and dimers consisting of any combinations thereof, such as dicyclopentadiene, and the like. In this invention, these cyclopentadiene derivatives may be used alone or in combination of two or more different derivatives. Among them, cyclopentadiene, dicyclopentadiene and a mixture of the two are preferred. The cyclopentadiene derivative used in this invention may contain impurities so long as the reaction is not hindered thereby. Polymerizable monomers other than the cyclopentadiene derivatives may be used in the production of the aforesaid polymers in this invention hereinafter referred to merely as the polymerizable monomers , and as the polymerizable monomers, there may be used hydrocarbon compounds having at least one olefinic double bond in the molecule, including aliphatic, alicyclic and aromatic ones. In order to sulfonate the portion of said polymerizable monomer in the polymers, it is necessary that at least one double bond should remain in the said portion. Therefore, the hydrocarbon compounds should preferably have at least two double bonds in the molecule, as in, for example, dienes.However, aliphatic dienes are not preferable for the purpose of increasing the strength of cement because they cause a large decrease of the surface tension of an aqueous solution of the resulting sulfonation product and also cause an increase of the air entraining effect when used as dispersants for cenent. In the case of using the polymerizable monomer, the amount thereof is such that the proportion of the cyclopentadiene derivative to the polymerizable monomer is preferably 20 by weight or more, more preferably 50 by weight or more. An acidic compound catalyst is used in the production of the aforesaid polymers in this invention, and as the acidic compound in this case, there may be used, for example, Lewis acids such as sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, hydrogen fluoride, boron trifluoride, boron trifluoride complexes, aluminium chloride, aluminium bromide, tin tetrachloride, zinc chloride, titanium trichloride, and the like or organic protonic acids. In the presence of such a catalyst, the cyclo pntadiene derivative is usually subjected, alone or together with the polymerizable monomer, to polymerization at a reaction temperature of 200C to 1500C for several hours to obtain a polymer. In this polymerization, a polymerization solvent for allowing the reaction to proceed smoothly may be used, and as such a polymerization solvent, any solvent such as a hydrocarbon, a halogenated hydrocarbon or the like may be used so long as the polymerization is not hindered. The number average molecular weight of the aforesaid polymer may properly be varied depending upon the reaction conditions, in particular, the kind and amount of the acidic compound catalyst and the reaction temperature, though it is preferably 200 or more when the sulfonation product of this invention is used as the dispersant for cement described below, and it is also preperable that the number average molecular weight is 10,000 or less from the viewpoint of facilitating the sulfonation of said polymers. The number average molecular weight is particularly preferably 300 to 5,000. The number of double bonds remaining in the aforesaid polymer hereinafter referred to merely as the residual double bonds can be determined by, for example, iodometry, and, in usual, they remain in a proportion of 0.3 to 1 double bond per molecule of the cyclopentadiene derivative. For sulfonating the polymer thus obtained, there may be used the methods described in detail inE.E. Gilbert, ,Sulfonation and Related Reaction ,Interscience Publishers Inc. 1965 , and a sulfonation method applicable to unsaturated compounds, in particular, unsaturated aliphatic or alicyclic compounds, may properly be selected depending upon the conditions of a reaction system. The sulfonation products can also be obtained by the addition reaction of a sulfite to unsaturation shown in Charles J. Norton, The Journal of OrganicChemistry , 4158 1968 . As the sulfonating agents, in this case, there are usually used acidic sulfites, metasulfites or sulfites of alkali metals alone or in admixture of two or more. The amount of the sulfonating agent may vary depending upon the.required degree of sulfonation, and cannot unconditionally be determined, but in usual, they are used in a proportion of 0.1 to 10 molecules per one residual double bond in the polymer. In the sulfonation, the employment of a catalyst is not always required, but in usual, the reaction time can be shortened when a catalyst such as an inorganic oxidizing agent or the like is used. As the inorganic oxidizing agent, there may be used, for example, nitrates, nitrites, chlorates and the like, and nitrates are particularly preferred. It is preferable to use a suitable solvent in order to allow the reaction to proceed uniformly and smoothly. As said solvent, there may advantageously be used, for example, water, lower alchols such as methyl alcohol, ethyl aclohol, propyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, butyl alcohol, tertiary butyl alcohol and the like, lower glycols, ketones, ethers, esters, etc.These solvents may properly be used in admixture of two or more. Among them, a mixed solvent of a lower alcohol and water, in particular, a mixed solvent of propyl alcohol and water, is recommended as an excellent solvent. In order to dissolve the aforesaid polymer more uniformly, there may be co used another solvent inert to the sulfonation, for example, an aromatic hydrocarbon such as benzene, toluene, xylene, ethylbenzene or the like an aliphatic hydrocarbon such as pentane, heptane, decane or the like or a cyclic ether such as tetrahydrofuran or the like. The reaction temperature in the sulfonation is usually 500 to 2000C, preferably 700 to 1500C, more preferably 900 to 1200C, and the reaction can be effected either at atmospheric pressure or under pressure. In order to suppress the progress of side reactions and inhibit the production of unnecessary inorganic salt, the pH of the reaction system is usually kept at 2 to 9, preferably 5 to 7. In the sulfonation products thus obtained, 20 to 100 of the residual double bonds in the aforesaid polymers have been sulfonated. The degree of the sulfonation can be obtained by converting the obtained sulfonation product into its acid form by an ion exchange method, and subjecting the acid form to alkalimetry. The sulfonation products of this invention can be converted into their acid forms, which can further be converted into their salt forms with an alkali metal, an alkaline earth metal, ammonia, and an amine, by an ion exchange method, a neutralization method or the like. The cyclopentadiene derivatives used in above 2 is the same as those described in above 1 . As the compound represented by the formula C in 2 , there may be used, for example, benzene and mono or di alkyl sub stirred benzenes such as toluene, xylene o , m , p , ethylbenzene, n propylbenzene, iso propylbenzene, methylethylbenzene o , m , p , n butylbenzene, secbutylbenzene, tert butylbenzene, iso propyltoluene o , m , p , amylbenzene, hexylbenzene, amyltoluene o , m , p , and the like. The alkyl groups in this case are those having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and the two alkyl groups may form a ring together with the adjacent carbon atoms7 an example of this case being tetrahydronaphthalene.Among the compounds described above, preferable are those in which R4 and R5 are independently hydrogen atoms or alkyl groups having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and particularly preferable are benzene, toluene, xylene, propylbenzene and butylbenzene. In this invention, the above mentioned compounds may be used alone or in combination of two or more. In this invention, when the cyclopentadiene derivative is reacted with the compound represented by the formula C , an acidic compound is used as a catalyst. As the acidic compound, there may be used, for example, Lewis acids such as s u 1 f u r i c a c i d , p h o s ph o ric acid, hydrogen fluoride, boron trifluoride, boron trifluoride complexes, aluminum chloride, aluminum bromide, tin tetrachloride, zinc chloride, titanium trichloride, and the like or organic protonic acids. In the presence of such an acidic compound the cyclopentadiene derivative is usually mixed with the compound represented by yhe formula C in a molar ratio of 100 1 to 1 100, and an appropriate solvent is added thereto, after which the resulting mixture is subjected to reaction at a temperature of, in usual, 200 to 1500C, preferably 0 to 1200C, for several hours to obtain a reaction mixture.The thus obtained reaction mixture is a mixture of many compounds, for example, several adducts such as a reaction product formed by the addition of one molecule of the compound represented by the formula C to one molecule of a dicyclopentadiene and a reaction product formed by the addition of one molecule of the compound represented by the formula C to two molecules of a dicyclopentadiene polymers of a cyclopentadiene and or a dicyclopentadiene and reaction products formed by the addition of the compound represented by the formula tC to the polymers. The proportions of various reaction products in the reaction mixture can properly be controlled by selecting the kind of a catalyst, the reaction temperature, the proportions of the starting materials charged and the like. The lower limit of the molecular weight of the reaction mixture is the molecular weight of a reaction product formed by the addition of one molecule of the compound represented by the formula C to one molecule of cyclopentadiene, and the upper limit of the molecular weight varies depending upon the reaction conditions and is not critical, but it is preferable that the number average molecular weight is 10,000 or less from the viewpoint of the facilitation of sulfonation described hereinfater. The number average molecular weight is determined by converting the result of GPC gel permeation chromatography3 by use of a calibration curve obtained by using several polystyrenes different in molecular weight as standard substances. It is also possible to control the surface active effects of the sulfonation products described hereinafter by adding other dienes or olefines to the starting materials previously and subjecting them to the above mentioned reaction together with the starting material. The method for sulfonating said reaction mixture is the same as described in above 1 . The condensates 3 can be obtained by condensing the sulfonation product 2 through an aldehyde in the presence of an acid catalyst. As the aldehyde, there may be used, for example, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde and the like, among which formaldehyde is preferred from the viewpoint of the reactivity. The amount of the aldehyde used may be varied in a considerably wide range, but in order to increase the degree of condensation and avoid unnecessary side reactions, it is preferably 0.5 to 2 moles, more preferably 0.8 to 1.5 moles, per mole of the compound of the formula C added to the cyclopentadiene skeleton and or dicyclopentadiene sheletone in the sulfonation products. In the condensation of the aforesaid sulfonation products, other condensing monomers, for example, benzene derivatives such as benzene, toluene, xylene, phenol and the like sulfonic acids of the benzene derivatives or salts thereof naphthalene derivatives and sulfonic acids of naphthalene derivatives or salts thereof such as sodium B naphthalenesulfonate, may be condensed alone or in proper combination of two ar more along with the sulfonation products 2 . The surface active effect of the condensates of this invention can freely be controlled by properly selecting said other condensing monomers. In effecting the condensation, the sulfonation products may be condensed after the low boiling compounds or high boiling compounds contained therein have been removed. As the acid catalyst 7 the condensation, sulfuric acid may be used as a representative. Although the amount of sulfuric acid used is not critical, it is usually 0.0001 to 10 moles, preferably 0.01 to 5 moles, more preferably 0.05 to 3 moles, per mole of the total condensing monomers. When it is less than 0.0001 mole, the reaction rate decreases and the degree of condensation becomes low. When it is more than 10 moles, carbonization tends to occur. ghen the sulfonation products are in the acid form, they can also act as an acid catalyst, and the number of moles of the sulfonation products in the acid form may be calculated as the number of moles of the acid catalyst. In order to effect uniform condensation, it is preferable to use water, a lower alcohol, formic acid, acetic acid or the like as a solvent for the condensation. Although the amount of the solvent used may properly be varied depending upon the reaction rate, the solubility and the like, it is usually 0.01 to 10 parts by weight of the solvent per part by weight of the starting material mixture for the condensation.The condensation temperature is usually 300 to 1500C, preferably 700 to 1200C. The degree of condensation of the condensate obtained can properly be controlled by altering the reaction conditions such as the amount of the acid catalyst, the condensation temperature, the condensation time and the like. It is desirable to select a degree of condensation matching the application purposes. When it is used, for example, as a dispersant for cement, the number average molecular weight thereof is preferably 500 to 30,000, more preferably 800 to 10,000.The number average molecular weight can be determined by aqueous system GPC gel permeation chromatography , and is converted by use of a calibration curve obtained by using, as standard substances, several sodium polystyrenesulfonates different in molecular weight, several sodium anthracenesulfonates different in molecular weight and several sodium benzenesulfonates different in molecular weight. The term condensates used in above 4 means condensates obtained by condensing molecules of one of the sulfonated cyclopentadiene derivatives represented by the formula D condensates obtained by condensing different sulfonated cyclopentadiene derivatiges represented by the formula D and condensates obtained by condensing a sulfonated cyclopentadiene derivative represented by the formula D with a monomer condensable therewith other than the sulfonated cyclopentadiene derivatives represented by the formula D . In the formula D , when M is a hydrogen atom, an alkali metal atom, ammonium or an amine, n l, and when M is an alkaline earth metal atom, n 2. As the aforesaid alkali metal atom, there may be used sodium, potassium and the like. As the amine, there may be used alkylamines such as methylamine, ethylamine, propylamine, dimethtlamine, diethylamine, trimethylamine, triethylamine, butylamine, dibutylamine, tributylamine and the like polyamines such as ethyllenediamine, diethylenetriamine, triethylenetetramine and the like morpholine piperidine etc. As the alkaline earth metal atom, there may be used calcium, magnesium, zinc and the like. One of the above M s may be converted into the other M, and the latter into the former, by various ion exchange techniques or neutralization. Each of R4, R5 and R6 in the sulfonated cyclopentadiene derivatives represented by the formula D is preferably a hydrogen atom, a methyl group, a propyl group or a butyl group, and each of R2 and R3 is preferably a hydrogen atom. For the production of the sulfonated cyclopentadiene derivatives represented by the formula D , various production processes are applicable. For example, the sulfonated cyclopentadiene derivatives represented by the formula D can be produced by sulfonating a compound having the structural formula H shown below, and then, if necessary, converting it to a sulfonic acid salt EMI16.1 wherein R2, R3, R4, R5 and R6 are the same as defined above. The method for the sulfonation of the compound having the structural formula H is the same as described above as to the sulfonation products 1 . The compound having the structural formula H can be obtained, for example, by a Friedel Crafts reaction of a compound represented by the structural formular I shown below with a compound represented by the formula B .EMI17.1 wherein R4, R5 and R6 are the same as defined above. As the compound represented by the structural formula I , benzene or alkylbenzenes may be used, and as the alkylbenzens, there may be used, for example, mono , di or tri alkyl substituted benzenes such as toluene, xylene o , m , p , ethylbenzene, n propylbenzene, iso propylbenzene, methylethylbenzene o , m , p , 1,2, 4 trimethylbenzene, n butylbenzene, secbutylbenzene, tert butylbenzene, iso propyltoluene o , m , p , amylbenzene, hexylbenzene, amyltoluene o , m , p , and the like. The alkyl groups in this case have 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and the two alkyl groups may form a ring together with the adjacent carbon atoms, an example of which is tetrahydronaphthalene. Compounds having the structural formula I in which R6 is hydrogen are particularly preferred, and as such compounds, there may be used benzene, toluene, xylene, propylbenzene and butylbenzene. The compound having the structural formula B is as defined above as to the sulfonation products l and 2 . As catalysts for synthesizing a compound represented by the above structural formula H by a FriedelCrafts reaction of a compound represented by the above structural formula I with a compound represented by the formula B , there may be used acidic compounds, for example, Lewis acids such as sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, hydrogen fluoride, boron trifluoride, boron trifluoride complexes, aluminium chloride, aluminium bromide, tin tetrachloride, zinc chloride, titanium trichloride, and the like or organic p r O t o n i c a c i d s T h e reaction is effected according to a well known method, e.g., Japanese Patent Application Kokai Laid Open No.133,968 77. For example, the compound having the structural formula H can be obtained by reacting a compound having the structural formula I and a compound represented by the formula B in the presence of one of the above mentioned catalysts for about 1 to 5 hours at a temperature of preferably 0 to 1000C, particularly preferably 200 to 700C. The compound represented by the structural formula H can also be synthesized by a Friedel Crafts reaction of a compound having the structural formula I with a compound having the structural formula J EMI18.1 wherein R2 and R3 are the same as defined above, andX is a hydroxyl group or a halogen. As the compound represented by the structural formula J , there may be used, for example, hydroxydihydro dicyclopentadiene, chloro dihydro dicyclopentadiene, bromo dihydro dicyclopentadiene, etc. The Friedel Crafts reaction of a compound represented by the structural formula I with a compound represented by the structural formula J can be effected by employing the same catalyst, the same reaction temperature and the same reaction time as employed for the Friedel Crafts reaction of a compound having the structural formula I with a compound having the formula B . The compound having the structural formula J has a halogen atom active against the Friedel Crafts reaction, and therefore, when the Friedel Crafts reaction is conducted using the compound having the structural formula J , the compound having the structural formula rH can be obtained at a high selectivity. The sulfonated cyclopentadiene derivative represented by the formula D is usually a white to slightly yellow solid, but this state may be varied depending upon the kinds of the compound represented by the structural formula I , the compound represented by the structural formula B and the compound represented by the structural formula J which are the starting materials. The condensates 4 of this invention can be obtained by condensing a sulfonated cyclopentadiene derivative represented by the formula D alone or in admixture with a monomer co condensable therewith other than the sulfonated cyclopentadiene derivative represented by the formula D they are hereinafter referred to as the condensing composition through an aldehyde in the presence of an acid catalyst. Molecules of one of the sulfonated cyclopentadiene derivatives represented by the formula D may be condensed with one another, or two or more different sulfonated cyclopentadiene derivatives represented by the formula D may be condensed with one another. As the aforesaid aldehyde, there may be used, for instance, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde and the like, among which formaldehyde is preferred from the viewpoint of the reactivity. The amount of the aldehyde used may be varied in a considerably wide range, but in order to increase the degree of condensation and avoid unnecessary side reaction, it is preferably 0.5 to 2 moles, more preferably 0.8 to 1.5 moles per mole of the condensing composition. Sulfuric acid is a representative of the aforesaid acid catalyst. The amount of the acid catalyst used i s 0.0001 to 10 moles, preferably 0.01 to 5 moles, more preferably 0.05 to 3 moles, per mole of the condensing composition. When it is less than 0.0001 mole, the reaction rate decreases and the degree of condensation becomes low. When it is more than 10 moles, carbonization tends to occur. When the condensing composition contains a sulfonated cyclopentadiene derivative represented by the formula D in which M is a hydrogen atom, said sulfonated cyclopentadiene derivative itself is an acid and hence, can also acts as an acid catalyst. Therefore, the number of moles of the sulfonated cyclopentadiene derivative may be calculated as the number of moles of the acid catalyst. In order to effect uniform condensation, it is preferable to use water, a lower alcohol, formic acid, acetic acid or the like as a condensation solvent. The amount of the solvent used may properly be selected in consideration of the reaction rate, the solubility and the like. When, for example, water is used as the solvent in the production of the condensate of this invention from the condensing composition consisting only of a sulfonated cyclopentadiene derivative represented by the formula n t the amount of water used is 2 to 100 moles, preferably 5 to 20 moles, per mole of said sulfonated cyclopentadiene derivative. The condensation temperature is 30 to 1500C, preferably 700 to 1200C. As the co condensable monomers other than the sulfonated cyclopentadiene derivatives represented by the formula D , there may be used, for instance, benzene derivatives such as benzene, toluene, xylene, phenol and the like sulfonic acids of benzene derivatives or salts thereof naphthalene derivatives and sulfonic acids of naphthalene derivatives or salts thereof such as sodium 8 naphthalenesulfonate, though the cocondensable monomers are not limited thereto. These compounds may be used alone or in combination of two or more. The HLB surface active effect of the condensate of this invention can freely be controlled by selecting an appropriate condensable monomer. The amount of the co condensable monomer is preferably in such a range that the characteristics of the condensate of this invention is not deteriorated.In consideration of the solubility in water too, the content of the sulfonated cyclopentadiene derivative represented by the formula D in the condensing composition is within a range of 20 mole or more, preferably 50 mole or more. The degree of condensation of the condensate obtained can properly be controlled by varying reaction conditions such as the amount of the acid catalyst, the condensation temperature, the condensation time and the like. It is necessary that the degree of condensation should be controlled depending upon purposes. When the condensate obtained is used as, for example, a dispersant for cement, a condensate in which 2 to 100 units of a sulfonated cyclopentadiene derivative represented by the formula D have been condensed is preferred. The compounds 5 of the formula E are obtained by re sulfonating a sulfonated dicyclopentadiene derivative represented by the formula K . EMI23.1 wherein R7, R8 and M are the same as defined above, and n is 1 or 2, and when M is an alkaline earth metal n is 2. The compound represented by the formula K can be produced by adding sodium hydrogensulfite to a reaction product obtained by effecting a Friedel Crafts reaction of dicyclopentadiene with benzene or an alkylbenzene in the presence of, for example, a BF3 catalyst. The process for producing the compound represented by the formula E can be practiced by reacting a compound of the formula K with a sulfuric acid such as sulfuric acid, sulfuric anhydride or fuming sulfuric acid. The molar ratio of the sulfuric acid to the compound K is not critical, but in usual, it is preferably in the range of 0.1 to 5 because when it is less than 0.1, the yield becomes low and when it is more than 5, side reactions such as carbonization and the like take place. The reaction tegrature is also not critical, but in overall consideration of the reaction rate, the occurrence of side reactions and the like, it is preferably 500 to 1500C, more preferably 800 to 1300C. In order to allow the reaction to proceed smoothly, there may be used water, organic acids, organic solvents7 alcohols and the like as solvents. On the other hand, when water is used as the solvent, the viscosity at the time of the reaction can be kept low, but the progress of the reaction becomes slow. Therefore, when water and a solvent showing azeotropy with water, for example, heptane, are added at the same time and the reaction is effected while removing the water, the reaction rate becomes rapid. This method is applied also when the reaction is effected while removing water in sulfuric acid. The compounds 6 also include condensates obtained by condensing a compound of the formula E alone through an aldehyde and compounds obtained by condensing a compound E with a co condensable compound, e.g., a benzene derivative such as benzene, toluene, xylene, phenol or the like, naphthalenesulfonic acid or its salt or the like through an aldehyde. As the condensation method, the method described in above 4 may be employed. In the formulas E and K , M is hydrogen, alkali metal, amonium, an amine, or an alkaline earth metal. As the aforesaid alkali metal atom, there may be used sodium, potassium and the like. As the amine, there may be used alkylamines such as methylamine, triethylamine, ethylamine, propylamine, dimethylamine, diethylamine, trimethylamine, triethylamine, butylamine, dibutylamine, tributylamine and the like polymaines such as ethylenediamine, diethylenetriamine and the like morpholine piperidine etc. As the alkaline earth metals, there may be used calcium, magnesium and the like. These M s are interconvertible into one another by various ion exchange techniques. In the case where M is Na which is one of the alkali metals, the general formula K is represented as follows n is 1 EMI25.1 and the general formula E is represented as follows m is 2 EMI25.2 In the case where M is Ca which is one of the alkaline earth metal, the general formula K is represented as follows n is 2 EMI25.3 and the general formula E is represented as follows m is 1 EMI26.1 For the production of the compounds 7 , various production processes are conceivable.For example, they can be produced by a process which comprises sulfonatiing dicyclopentadiene represented by the formula L shown below, and then, if necessary, converting it into a sulfonate EMI26.2 As to the sulfonation applied to unsaturated compounds, in particular, unsaturated aliphatic compounds or unsatzirated alicyclic compounds, the method described in above l is applied, and although the amount of the sulfonating agent is not critical, it is 0.1 to 2.0 moles, preferably 0.5 to 1.2 moles, more preferably 0.5 to 1.0 mole, per mole of the dicyclopentadiene. When it is less than 0.1 mole, the yield in the reaction becomes low, and when it exceeds 2.0 moles, compounds in which the double bond in the cyclopentene ring has also been sulfonated are produced in a large amount. In the formula F for the compouna 7 , M is the same as defined in the formula E , and the specific alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, and amines mentioned above for the formulas E and K may also be used. TheseM s are convertible into one another depending upon purposes by various ion exchange techniques. In the case where n is 1, namely M is, for example, Na which is one of the alkali metal, the general formula F is represented as follows EMI27.1 In the case where n is 2, namely M is, for example, Ca which is one of the alkaline earth metals, the general formula F is represented as follows EMI27.2 The compound 7 is usually a white to slightly yellow solid, and can be separated from the unreacted organic compounds, for example, by extraction with water.Owing to this procedure, unreacted inorganic salts present in the aqueous phase can be separated by a method such as crystallization or the like. The sulfonation product thus obtained is a mixture of that having one sulfonic acid group per molecule and that having two sulfonic acid groups per molecule, and the proportions of these components can properly be varied depending upon the kind and amount of the sulfonating agent, the ratio of the sulfonating agent to the dicyclopentadiene, the kind and amount of the inorganic oxidizing agent or the solvent, the reaction temperature, and the like. The sulfonated dicyclopentadienes may be any of the two kinds of sulfonation products described above.However, from the viewpoint of the facilitation of the polymerization when they are polymerized to obtain a polymer, the sulfonated dicyclopentadiene preferably has residual double bonds and it contains preferably 20 or more of that having one sulfonic acid group per molecule. The sulfonated dicyclopentadiene contains more preferably 50 or more and most preferably 80 or more of that having one sulfonic acid group per molecule. The number of sulfonic acid groups of the aforesaid sulfonated dicyclopentadiene can be determined by a usual method such as titration with an alkali. The salts of sulfonic acids include salts with an alkali metal such as sodium, potassium or the like salts with an alkylamine such as methylamine, ethylamine or the like salts with an alkaline earth metal such as calcium, magnesium or the like and ammonium salts. The compounds 8 are polymers or copolymers of the compounds of the formula F , and an example of a process for producing them is shown below. An acidic compound catalyst is used as a polymerization catalyst, and it includes, for example, L e w i s a c i d s such as sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, hydrogen fluoride, boron trifluoride, boron trifluoride complexes, aluminum chloride, aluminum bromide, tin tetrachloride, zinc chloride, titanium trichloride, and the like or organic protonic acids. In the presence of such a catalyst, the sulfonated dicyclopentadiene 7 alone or in admixture with a copolymerizable monomer hereinafter referred as the commonomer is polymerized, in usual, at a reaction temperature of 200 to 3000C, preferably 800 to 1800C for a period of several hours to several tens of hours to obtain a polymer. In the polymerization, a polymerization solvent may be used for effecting the reaction smoothly, and as such a polymerization solvent, there may be used a polar solvent such as water, a hydrocarbon, a halogenated hydrocarbon or the like, so long as the polymerization is not hindered. It is also possible to control the HLB surface active effect by copolymerizing the sulfonation product 7 with the comonomer. As the comonomer, there may be used, in any proportion, one or more member selected from the group consisting of aliphatic, alicyclic and aromatic hydrocarbons having an olefinic unsaturation, olefinically unsaturated amides, olefinically unsaturated alcohols, olefinically unsaturated esters, olefinically unsaturated nitriles, olefinically unsaturated carboxylic acids and esters, olefinically unsaturated sulfonic acids and esters, etc. However, when the co polymer is used as a dispersant for cement, the content of the sulfonated dicyclopentadiene in the co polymer of this invention is 508 or more, preferably 70 or more, most preferably 90 or more in order to keep the air entraining property at a low level. The molecular weight of the co polymer of the aforesaid sulfonated dicyclopentadiene can properly be controlled by selecting reaction conditions, in particular, the kind and amount of the acidic compound catalyst and the kind and amount of the solvent, the reaction temperature, or the reaction time, When the polymers or copolymers of the aforesaid sulfonated dicyclopentadienes are used as dispersants for cement, the number average molecular weight of the polymer or copolymer is preferably 500 or more, more preferably 2,000 or more, most preferably 3,500 to 50,000. The co polymer of the aforesaid sulfonated dicyclopentadiene can be converted into the acid form, which can further be converted to the salt form with an alkali metal, an alkaline earth metal, ammonia, or an amine by an ion exchange method, neutralization or the like. In the compounds 9 , M is as defined in the case of the compounds 5 . When Na is used as the alkali metal, the compound 9 is represented by the formula EMI30.1 When Ca is used as the alkaline earth metal, the compound 9 is represented by the general formula EMI31.1 For the production of the compounds 9 , various processes are conceivable. For example, they can be produced by a process which comprises sulfonating a hydroxydicyclopentadiene represented by the formula M shown below, and then, if necessary, converting it into a sulfonate EMI31.2 As a method for sulfonating the compound M , the method described as to the above compounds 1 is applied. Although the amount of a sulfonating agent is not critical, it is used in an amount of, for example, 2.0 moles per mole of the hydroxydicyclopentadiene. When the amount thereof is less than 0.1 mole, the yield in the reactior becomes low, and therefore, in usual, the sulfonating agent is preferably used in an amount of 0.5 mole or more. The compound 9 is usually a white to slightly yellow solid and the M s are convertible into one another by various ion exchange techniques. The compounds 10 are polymers or copolymers of the compounds of the formula G . An example of a process for producing them is shown below. An acidic compound catalyst is used as the polymerization catalyst, and as this catalyst, there may be used, for instant,Lewis acids s u c h a s s u 1 f u r i c acid, phosphoric acid, hydrogen fluoride, boron trifluoride, boron trifluoride complexes, aluminum chloride, aluminum bromide, tin tetrachloride, zinc chloride, titanium trichloride, and the like or organic protonic acids. In the presence of such a catalyst, the sulfonated hydroxydicyclopentadiene is polymerized alone or in admixture with the comonomer, in usual, at a reaction temperature of 200 to 3000C, preferably 800 to 1800C for a period of several hours to several tens of hours to obtain a polymer. In the polymerization, a polymerization solvent may be used for effecting the reaction smoothly, and as such a polymerization solvent, there may be used a polar solvent such as water, a hydrocarbon, a halogenated hydrocarbon or the like, so long as the polymerization is not hindered. It is also possible to control the HLB surface active effect by copolymerizing the sulfonation product of this invention with the comonomer. Specific exampleS of the comonomer are as mentioned hereinbefore. The molecular weight of the co polymer of the aforesaid sulfonation product can properly be controlled by selecting reaction conditions, in particular, the kind and amount of the acidic compound catalyst and the kind and amount of the solvent, the reaction temperature, or the reaction time. When the co polymer of the sulfonation product of this invention is used as a dispersant for cement., the number average molecular weight of the co polymer is preferably 500 or more, more preferably 2,000 or more, most preferably 3,500 to 50,000. The co polvmer of the sulfonated product of this invention can be converted into the acid form which can further be converted to the salt form with an alkali metal, an alkaline earth metal, ammonia, or an amine by an ion exchange method, neutralization or the like. Since the compounds 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 and 10 of this invention have an excellent surface active effect, they are very useful as surfactants for organic materials or inorganic materials, and are used as, for example, emulsifiers, dispersants, wetting agents, detergents and smoothing agents or as intermediates for synthesizing the compounds 7 and 9 . They are particularly useful as dispersants for cement, and in this case, the dispersibility of cement in water can greatly be improved, so that the amount of water can be decreased in a cement construction method. This invention relates also to a slurry composition comprising a powder, a dispersant having at least one sulfonic acid group and a polymer emulsion. In general, dispersants are used for dispersing a powder of cement, gypsum, pigment, dye or the like in a medium such as water or the like. Particularly, in the case of cement paste it has strongly been desired that the hardened cement does not have cracks and has a high strength. Therefore, attempts have been made to make the amount of water in the cement paste as small as possible. However, when the proportion of water in the cement paste is simply made small, the fluidity of the cement paste is lowered, so that the desired cemenet construction cannot be carried out. Therefore, an attempt has been made to add a dispersant to reduce the proportion of water and si ultaneously attain a high fluidity.The dispersant includes those of naphthalene type, triazine type, lignin type, polyol type, oxycarboxylic acid type and the like, and these compounds are used alone or in combination of two or more. However, when the said dispersants are added, the resulting cement paste has a high fluidity at the beginning of the addition, but shows such phenomena that the slump loss is great and the fluidity decreases in a very short time. This is a serious disadvantage in cement construction method. In view of the situation described above, the present inventors have conducted extensive research to find that the addition of a polymer emulsion together with a dispersant having at least one sulfonic acid group to cement improves the dispersing effect of the dispersant, further enhances the fluidizing effect of the dispersant, and makes the slump loss very small and the workability good, and also find that an excellent dispersibility can be obtained also when a dispersant having at least one sulfonic acid group and the aforesaid polymer emulsion are added to a powder other than cement, for example, gypsum, pigment, dye, etc. An object of this invention is to provide a slurry composition having an excellent dispersability. Another object of this invention is to provide a slurry composition comprising cement as powder, which can give a cement paste having a high fluidity, showing only a small slump loss, and a low entrainability. According to this invention, there is provided a slurry composition characterized by comprising a powder, a dispersant having at least one sulfonicracid group, and a polymer emulsion, the polymer emulsion being present in a proportion of 0.05 to 50 parts by weight in terms of solids per 100 parts by weight of said dispersant. The slurry composition of this invention may contain additives properly added depending on the kind of the powder. In this invention, as the powder, there may be used cement, gypsum, a pigment, a dye or the like. Among them, as the cement, there may be used, for example, various portland cements such as normal portland cement, high early strength portland cement, ultra high early strength portland cement, moderate heat portland cement, sulfate resistant portland cement, white iron portland cement and the like well known cements such as blast furnace cement, portland pozzolan.cement, fly fly ash cement, aluminous c e m e n t , calcium silicate and the like mixed cements obtained by combining two or more of them and mixed cement of these cements and inorganic materials such as gypsum and the like. There may be used mortar obtained by adding sand to these cements, concrete obtained by further adding gravel to the mortor, etc.There may also be added, depending on purposes, various additives conventionally used as compounding agents for cement, for example, airentraining agents, accelerating agents, retarding agents, water proofing agents and the like in any combination. As the dispersant having at least one sulfonic acid group, there may be used, for example, conventionai dispersatns, e.g., those commercially available as dispersants, such as condensates of naphthalenesulfonates, condensates of triazinesulfonates, condensates of alkylallylsulfonates, condensates of anthracenesulfonates, lignin sulfonates, co condensates of lignin and naphthalenesulfonates, and the like, and those obtained by modifying these dispersants sulfonation products obtained by sulfonating a reaction mixture prepared by reacting a cyclopentadiene derivative represented by the formula A or B shown below with a compound represented by the formula C shown below condensation products obtained by condensing the sulfonation mixture through an aldehyde or the like sulfonation products obtained by sulfonating a polymer prepared by polymerizing a cyclopentadiene derivative represented, for example, by the formula A or B shown below sulfonation products of cyclopentadiene derivatives represented by the formula D shown below or condensates obtained by condensing these sulfonation products through an aldehyde sulfonation products of dicyclopentadienes represented by the formula E or co polymers thereof and sulfonation products of hydroxydicyclopentadienes represented by the formula F or cc polymers thereof EMI37.1 wherein R1 is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms,EMI37.2 wherein R2 and R3, which may be identical or different, are hydrogen atoms or alkyl groups having 1 to 3 carbon atoms,EMI38.1 wherein R4 and R5, which may be identical or different, are hydrogen atoms or alkyl groups having 1 to 6 carbon atoms,EMI38.2 wherein R2, R3, R4 and R5 are the same as defined above R6 is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms R4, R5 and R6 may be identical with or different from one another M is hydrogen, an alkali metal, an alkaline earth metal, ammonium or an amine and n is 1 or 2 and when M is an alkaline earth metal n is 2,EMI38.3 wherein M and n are the same as defined above, EMI39.1 wherein M and n are the same as defined above. These dispersants may be used alone or in combination of two or more, and it is also possible to use the dispersants having at least one sulfonic acid group in combination with dispersants free from sulfonic acid group. The proportion of the dispersant having at least one sulfonic acid group used may be varied depending on the kind of the powder. When the powder is particularly a cement, the proportion of said dispersant to the cement cannot unconditionally be defined because it is determined collectively considering compounding conditions such as the kind and proportion of the cement, the kind and proportion of an aggregate if added, and the like, and physical properties such as the required fluidity and the strength of the cement after hardening, but n general, it is preferable that the dispersant is used in a proportion of 0.01 to 10 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the cement. Although the polymer emulsion used in this invention is not critical, it is preferably a polymer emulsion obtained by subjecting polymerizable monomers alone or in combination of two or more to emulsion polymerization or suspension polymerization in an aqueous medium in the presence of a radical polymerization initiator. However there may satisfactorily be used a polymer emulsion obtained by the so called re emulsification method by which a solution prepared by dissolving a solid polymer obtained, for example, by solution polymerization, in a hydrophobic solvent is dispersed and emulsified in an aqueous medium with or without an emulsifier, and thereafter the hydrophobic solvent is removed. As the monomers used for preparing the polymer in such a polymer emulsion, the following are representatives, though other monomers than the following may also be appropriately sed aromatic alkenyl compounds such as styrene, a methylstyrene, monochlorostyrene, vinyltoluene, methoxystyrene and the like ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acids such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, crotonic acid and the like ethylenically unsaturated dicarboxylic acids such as itaconic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid and the like ethylenically unsatu ated monocarboxylic acid esters such as methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, propyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, lauryl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, propyl methacrylate, butyl methacrylate, hydroxyethyl acrylate, hydroxypropyl acrylate, hydroxyethyl methacrylate and the like ethylenically unsaturated dicarboxylic acid esters such as dimethyl itaconate, dimethyl maleate, and the like alkenyl cyanides such as acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile and the like conjugated dienes such as butadiene, isoprene, piperylene, chloroprene, butadienyl acetate and the like vinyl chloride vinylidene chloride vinyl methyl ketone vinyl methyl ether vinyl acetate vinyl formate allyl acetate methallyl acetate acrylamide methacrylamide N methylolacrylamine vinylpyridine glycidyl acrylate glycidyl methacrylate acrolein allyl alcohol and the like. When the aforesaid polymer emulsion is produced by emulsion polymerization or suspension polymerization, the polymerization temperature is usually 100C to 1000C, and either batch polymerization, semibatch polymerization or continuous polymerization may be effected. In such polymerization, polymerization initiators, chain transfer agents, emulsifiers and the like may appropriately be used, and depending on the like of the monomer, it is also possible to obtain a polymer emulsion by effecting the polymerization without any emulsifier. As the polymerization initiators used for producing the aforesaid polymer emulsion by emulsion polymerization or suspension polymerization, there may be used water soluble initiators such as potassium persulfate, ammonium persulfate and the like oil soluble initiators such as benzoyl peroxide and the like .redox initiators etc. As the chain transfer agents, there may be used tert dodecylmercaptan, carbon tetrachloride and the like which are usually used. Further, when the aforesaid polymer emulsion is produced by emulsion polymerization, the polymerization may be effected by adding polymerization adjuvants such as chelating agents, inorganic salts and the like which are used in the conventional emulsion polymerization. As the emulsifiers used for producing the aforesaid polymer emulsion by emulsion polymerization or by a re emulsification method, there may be used anionic surfactants and nonionic surfactants alone or in a proper combination. As the anionic surfactants, there may be used, for example, sulfuric esters of higher alcohols, alkylbenzenesulfonates, aliphatic sulfonates and the like, and as the nonionic surfactants, there may be used, for example, alkyl ester forms, alkyl ether forms and alkyl phenyl ether forms of polyethylene glycol, and the like. It is also possible to use polyvinyl alcohol or the like as an emulsification stabilizer together with these emulsifiers. Particularly preferred in this invention are the following two groups of emulsions 1 Polymer emulsions obtained by subjecting a polymerizable monomer to emulsion polymerization or suspension polymerization in an aqueous medium containing one or more surfactants in an amount ofO to 1 part by weight per 100 parts by weight of said polymerizable monomer. As surfactants usable for producing the aforesaid polymer emulsions 1 , those conventionally used in emulsion polymerization may be used, and among them, preferable are anionic surfactants such as sulfuric ester of higher alcohols, alkylbenzenesulfonates, aliphatic sulfonates and the like, and nonionic surfactants such as alkyl ester forms, alkyl ether forms and alkyl phenyl ether forms of polyethylene glycol, and the like. Such surfactants may be used alone or in combination of two or more, and the proportoin thereof is 0 to 1 part by weight, preferably 0 to 0.5 part by weight, and more preferably 0 to 0.2 part by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the polymerizable monomer.Said proportion is most preferably 0 part by weight so long as the polymer emulsions are satisfactorily produced.When it exceeds 1 part by weight, the resulting slurry composition foams greatly and the workability is deteriorated. That is to say, in order to inhibit the slurry composition from foaming it is ideal to use no surfactant in the production of the polymer emulsions. As the polymerizable monomer used for producing the polymer in the polymer emulsions 1 , those described above may be exemplified as representatives. 2 Polymer emulsions obtained by subjecting a polymerizable monomer mixture comprising at least one acrylic acid ester, at least one ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid, and, if necessary, at least one polymerizable monomer other than the aforesaid acrylic ester and ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid hereinafter referred to merely as the other monomer added thereto, to emulsion polymerization or suspension polymerization, for example, in an aqueous medium in the presence of a radical polymerization initiator.There may also satisfactorily be used polymer emulsions obtained by a so called re emulsification method by which a solution prepared by dissolving, in a hydrophobic solvent, a solid polymer obtained by polymerizing a polymerizable monomer mixture comprising at least one acrylic ester, at least one ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid, and, if necessary, the other monomer added thereto by solution polymerization or the like is dispersed and emulsified in an aqueous medium with or without an emulsifier, and thereafter, the hyrophobic solvent is removed. As the acrylic ester used for producing the polymer in the aforesaid polymer emulsions 2 , preferred are alkyl acrylate or hydroxyalkyl acrylate, the alkyl group of which is of a straight chain or branched chain and has 1 to 12 carbon atoms, and there may be used, for example, methyl acr71ate, ethyl acrylate, propyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, lauryl acrylate, hydroxyethyl acrylate, hydroxypropyl acrylate, and the like. These may be used alone or in combination of two or more. The proportion of the acrylate in the polymerizable monomer mixture is preferably 10 to 99.9 by weight, more preferably 30 to 99.9 by weight, and most preferably 70 to 99.9 by weight in order to obtain the effect of this invention sufficiently. As the ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid used for producing the polymer in the aforesaid polymer emulsions 2 , there may be used, for example, unsaturated monocarboxylic acids such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, crotonic acid and the like unsaturated dicarboxylic acids such as itaconic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid and the like and monoesters of said unsaturated ed dicarboxylic acids. These may be used alone or in combination of two or more. The proportion of such ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids in the polymerizable monomer mixture is preferably 0.1 to 20 by weight, mroe preferably 0.3 to 10 by weight, and most preferably 0.5 to 7 by weight in order to obtain the effect of this invention sufficiently. As the other monomer usable for producing the polymer in the aforesaid polymer emulsions 2 , the above mentioned polymerizable monomers other than the acrylic esters and ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids are representatives. As the emulsifier used for producing the aforesaid polymer emulsions 2 by emulsion polymerization or a re emulsification method, anionic surfactants or nonionic surfactants may be used alone or in a proper combination. As the anionic surfactants, there may be used, for example, sulfuric esters of higher alcohols, alkylbenzenesulfonates, aliphatic sulfonates and the like, and as the nonionic surfactants, there may be used, for example, alkyl ester forms, alkyl ether forms and alkyl phenyl ether forms of polyethylene glycol, and the like. Sl7zh surfactants may be used alone or in combination of two or more, and the proportion thereof is 0 to 1 part by weight, preferably 0 to 0.5 part by weight, more preferably 0 to 0.2 part by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the palymerizable monomer mixture. It is most preferably 0 part by weight per 100 parts by weight of the polymerizable monomer mixture, so long as the polymer emulsions are satisfactorily produced. When it exceeds 1 part by weight, the resulting slurry composition foams greatly. Therefore, it is not desirable. In this invention, the polymer emulsions obtained iri the manner described above may be used alone or in a proper combination of two or more. In this invention, the amount of the abovementioned polymer emulsion used is 0.05 to 50 parts by weight1 preferably 0.1 to 30 parts by weight, as solids per 100 parts by weight of the dispersant containing at least one sulfonic acid group. When it is less than 0.05 part by weight or more than 50 parts by weight, no effect can be obtained. In this invention, there may be used a method comprising previously mixing a dispersant having at least one sulfonic acid group with a polymer emulsion and adding the resulting mixture to a powder, or a method comprising separately adding said dispersant and said polymer emulsion to the powder. In the slurry composition of this invention, the dispersing effect of the dispersant is very great, a powder such as cement, gypsum, a pigment, a dye or the like is uniformly dispersed, and the durability of said effect is high. Particularly when the powder is cement, the dispersing effect of the dispersant is much greater, so that the fluidity of the resulting cement paste becomes very high, and only a very small slump loss is caused, and hence, the high fluidity is maintained for a long time. Further, air bubbles are hardly entrained, so that hardened cement having a high strength can be obtained, and therefore, a cement construction method can advantageously be carried out. This invention is further explained below referring to Examples and the accompanying drawings, in whichFig. 1 shows an infrared absorption spectrum of the condensate of this invention obtained in Example 12, Fig. 2 shows an infrared absorption spectrum of the sulfonation product obtained in Example 22, Fig. 3 shows an infrared absorption spectrum of the polymer obtained in Example 23,Fig. 4 shows an infrared absorption spectrum of the sulfonation product obtained in Example 28, Fig. 5 shows an infrared absorption spectrum of the sulfonation product obtained in Example 29, and Fig. 6 shows an infrared absorption spectrum of the sulfonation product obtained inExample 35. This invention should not be understood to be limited to the Examples. The number average molecular weights described inExamples 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8 are obtained by converting the results of measurement by GPC gel permeation chromatography , by use of a calibration curve obtained by using several polystyrenes different in molecular weight as standard substances. Example 1 In a l liter, three necked flask equipped with a reflux condenser and a stirrer were placed 400 g of nhexane and 4 g of a boron trifluoride phenol complex, and heated to a temperature of 500C, after which 140 g of dicyclopentadiene having a purity of 95 was added dropwise with stirring over a period of about 1 hour, and the resulting mixture was further subjected. to reaction at said temperature for 2 hours. After completion of the reaction, the catalyst was decomposed with an aqueous sodium carbonate solution, and the reaction mixture was washed with water, after which the oil layer was distilled under reduced pressure to remove n hexane and unreacted dicyclopentadiene. The weight of the resulting residue was 78 g, and the number average molecular weight of the residue was 2,100. The amount of the residual double bonds in the residue was determined by iodometry to find that it was 0.83 equivalent per mole of the reacted dicyclopentadiene. Subsevently, 20 g of the aforesaid residue, 30 g of toluene, 20 g of sodium hydrogensulfite, 2 g of potassium nitrate, 300 ml of isopropyl alcohol and 50 g of distilled water were placed in a l liter, stainless steel autoclave equipped with a stirrer and a thermometer, and air was supplied until the internal pressure in the autoclave became 1.0 Kg cm2 gauge pressure at room temperature. Then, the valve was locked up, and the mixture thus obtained was subjected to reaction at a temperature of 1100C for 5 hours while vigorously stirring the mixture. Thereafter, the reaction mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature, and the major part of the isopropyl alcohol was removed by distillation, after which 1 liter of distilled water and 1.5 liters of petroleum ether were added, and the resulting mixture was sufficiently stirred.The separated petroleum ether layer and the precipitates were removed, and the aqueous layer thus obtained was concentrated to dryness. The concentrate was then dissolved in glacial acetic acid, and an acetic acid insoluble fraction consisting of an inorganic salt was removed by filtration. The acetic acid soluble fraction thus obtained was concentrated, to obtain 18.7 g of a whitish yellow solid. This solid is named Sample l .

Subsequently, 15 g of the sulfonic acid type of the compound 0 and 6.9 g of sulfuric acid having a purity of 97 were charged into a 300 ml, threenecked flask equipped with a reflux condenser and a stirrer, and subjected to polymerization at a reaction temperature of 1200C for 25 hours with stirring. After completion of the reaction, the sulfuric acid was removed by procedures of liming and sodation to obtain 15.5 g of the Na salt of a polymer.

The specific gravity of green cement paste in this case was 2.23 g cm3. On the other hand, after 50 g of distilled water free from the Na salt of a polymer was kneaded with 200 g of Portland cement, the flow value was 87 mm and the specific gravity of green cement paste was 2.24 g cm3.From this, it can be seen that when the polymer of sulfonated dicyclopentadiene of this invention is used as a dispersant for cement, it had a very great and excellent effect on dispersing cement in water.

The concentrate was then dissolved in glacial acetic acid, and an acetic acid insoluble fraction consisting of inorganic salts was separated by means of a centrifuge. The acetic acid soluble fraction thus obtained was concentrated, to obtain 2,800 g of a white solid. The solid is named Sulfonation Product A EMI74.1 An aqueous solution of Sulfonation Product A was converted into the acid form, after which the aqueous solution was concentrated to dryness to obtain the acid form of the sulfonation product.This is named Sulfona tion Product B EMI75.1 Subsequently, 15 g of Sulfonation Product B and 6.88 g of sulfuric acid were placed in a 300 ml, three necked flask equipped with a reflux condenser and a stirrer, and subjected to polymerization at 1200C for 26 hours.

Sample 10 was converted into the acid form by means of an ion exchange resin and titrated with potassium hydroxide to find that the polymer had 0.96 sulfonic acid group per one molecule of dicyclopentadiene. Water was added to Sample 10 so as to prepare a 4 by weight aqueous solution, and the surface tension thereof at a temperature of 250C was determined as 63 dyn cm. The IR chart of Sample 10 is shown in Fig. 3, from which it can be seen that this polymer has sulfonic acid groups 1,190 cm 1 and 1,050 cm 1 , and the absorption due to double bond has become weak. Example 24 The same treatment as in Example 23 was repeated, except that Sulfonation Product A was used, to obtain a polymer having a number average molecular weight of 1,600. The polymer is named Sample 11 . An aqueous solution of Sample 11 was converted into the acid form by means of an ion exchange resin and titrated with potassium hydroxide solution to find that the polymer had 0.79 sulfonic acid group per one molecule of dicyclopentadiene. The surface tension of a 4 by weight aqueous solution of Sample 11 was 69.2 dyn cm.Example 25 The same procedure as in Example 23 was repeated, except that polymerization was conducted at a temperature of 1700C for 28 hours by using 30 g of Sulfonation ProductA, 125 g of sulfuric acid and 11.4 g of distilled water, to obtain a polymer having a number average molecular weight of 8,000. The polymer is named Sample 12 . The degree of sulfonation was measured in the same manner as in Example 24 to find that Sample 12 had 0.59 sulfonic acid group per one molecule of dicyclopentadiene. The surface tension of a 4 by weight aqueous solution of the sample 12 was 65 dyn cm.Example 26 In 50 g of distilled water was dissolved 2 g of each of Samples 10 to 12 to prepare four, in total, aqueous solutions. To each of the aqueous solutions was added 200 g of commercially available portland cement manufactured by Chichibu Cement Co., Ltd. , and the mixture thus obtained was kneaded by hand for 3 minutes, after which the flow value was measured by use of a flow corn with an inner volume of 98.9 cc according to JIS R5201. The results obtained were as shown in Table 4..

The flow value in this cae was determined as only 87 mm. As can be seen from Examples 23 to 25, the polymers of the sulfonation product of this invention have an excellent surface active effect, and as can be seen from Example 26, when they are used as dispersants for cement, they have a very great and excellent effect on dispersing cement in water. Example 27 In a 300 ml, three necked flask equipped with a reflux condenser and a stirrer were placed 13 g ofSulfonation Product A, 2 g of dicyclopentadiene and 6.88 g of sulfuric acid, and the resulting mixture was subjected to copolymerization at a temperature of 1200C for 20 hours. After the reaction, the reaction mixture was subjected to liming and sodation. The amount of the solid thus obtained was 15.0 g, and the surface tension of a 4 by weight aqueous solution of the obtained copolymer was 40 dyn cm, namely, the copolymer had an excellent surface active effect.Example 28 A 30 liter, stainless steel autoclave equipped with a closed electromagnetic induction stirrer was used as a reactor. In the autoclave were placed 2,000 g of hydroxydicyclopentadiene, 2,000 g of sodium hydrogensulfite, 200 g of potassium nitrate, 8,000 ml of isopropyl alcohol and 2,000 ml of distilled water. Subsequently, the autoclave was completely purged with nitrogen, and then sealed, after which the resulting mixture was subjected to reaction at 1100C for 5 hours while strongly stirring the mixture. After the reaction mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature, organic salts deposited from the reaction mixture were removed by suction filtration, and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to a volume of about 4 liters. To the concentrate were added 2.0 liters of distilled water and 1.5 liters of petroleum ether, and the resulting mixture was sufficiently stirred and then subjected to separation, whereby unreacted hydroxydicyclopentadiene was extracted into the petroleum ether layer and removed. The residue, i.e., the aqueous layer, was concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure to obtain 2,600 g of a whitish yellow solid. With the solid was mixed 4.0 liters of glacial acetic acid, and an acetic acid insoluble fraction consisting of organic salts such as NaHSO3, Na2SO3 and the like was separated by means of a centrifuge and removed. The acetic acid soluble fraction thus obtained was concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure to obtain 2,300 g of a light yellow solid. The light yellow solid was subjected to extraction with ethanol having a purity of 99.5 by means of a Soxhlet s extractor for 1 hour to extract and remove the residual acetic acid, and then dried. The elementary analysis of the dried solid showed that C 47.9 H 6.2 S 12.9 values calculated from the molecular formula C 47.2 H 5.9 S 12.6 . The solid was dissolved in water and freed from Na ion by using a cation exchange resin, after which the amount of sulfonic acid in the thus treated product was determined by titration as 93 of the calculated value. As a result of the measurmenet of infrared absorption spectrum of the treated product by a KBr disc method, an absorption due to hydroxyl group appeared at 3,440 cm , while absorptions due to cyclopentene ring double bond at 750 cm and 1,390 cm 1 observed in the case of dicyclopentadiene diminished and in place of thereof, strong absorptions due to sulfone group were observed at 1,190 cm 1 and 1,050 cm 1. Therefore, it was confirmed that the cyclopentene ring double bond had been sulfonated see Fig. 4 . As a result of the analysis described above, the product was identified as a compound having the structural formula P EMI80.1 The surface tension at a temperature of 25 C of a 4 by weight aqueous solution of the compound was determined as 40 dyn cm, indicating that the compound had a high surface active effect. The aforesaid compound P was dissolved in distilled water, and freed from Na ion by means of a cation exchange resin, after which the solution was concentrated to dryness, to obtain a solid of sulfonic acid of the aforesaid compound P . Subsequently, 30 g of the sodium sulfonate of the aforesaid compound P and 57 g of sulfuric acid having a purity of 97 were charged into a 300 ml, three necked flask equipped with a reflux condenser and a stirrer, and subjected to polymerization at a reaction temperature of 1300C for 20 hours with stirring. After completion of the reaction, the sulfuric acid was removed by procedures of liming and sodation to obtain 31 g of Na salt of a polymer. The Na salt of a polymer was analyzed by gel permeation chromatography to obtain a chromatograph having the main peak at a position corresponding to a molecular weight of 4,000. The Na salt of a polymer was dissolved in distilled water and freed from Na ion by using a cation exchange resin, and the amount of sulfonic acid in the thus treated product was measured by titration tq find that the treated product had 0.88 sulfonic acid group qer one molecule of the hydroxydicyclopentadiene. The surface tension at 250C of a 4 by weight aqueous solution of the Na salt of a polymer was determined as 68 dyn cm. Subsequently, 2 g of Na salt of a polymer was dissolved in 50 g of distilled water, and 200 g of portland cement manufactured by Chichibu Cement Co.,Ltd. was added, after which the resulting mixture was kneaded for 3 minutes. Thereafter, a flow corn having an inside diameter of 60 mm, a height of 35 mm and a capacity of 98.8 cm3 was produced, and the kneaded mixture was subjected to a flow test by use of the flow corn according to the physical test method for cement of JIS R5201, whereby the flow value was determined as 160 mm. The specific gravity of green cement paste in this case was 2.17 g cm3. On the other hand, when the Na salt of a polymer was not added, the flow value was 87 mm and the specific gravity of green cement paste was 2.24 g cm3. From this fact, it can be seen that when the polymer of sulfonated hydroxydicyclopentadiene of this invention is used as a dispersant for cement, it has a very great and excellent effect on dispersing cement in water.Example 29 In a 3 liter, three necked flask equipped with a reflux condenser and a stirrer were placed 1,270 g of toluene and 12 g of a boron trifluoride phenol complex, and the temperature was raised to 500C, after which a mixed solution of 417 g of dicyclopentadiene and 320 g of toluene was added dropwise with stirring over a period of about 1 hour, and the resulting mixture was subjected to reaction at said temperature for an additional 2 hours.After completion of the reaction, the catalyst was decomposed with an aqueous sodium carbonate solution, and the reaction mixture was washed with water, after which the oil layer was distilled under reduced pressure to obtain 423 g of toluene adduct of dicyclopentadiene. Subsequently, 200 g of the aforesaid toluene adduct of dicyclopentadiene, 97.8 g of sodium hydrogensulfite, 8.0 g of potassium nitrate, 1,360 ml of isopropyl alcohol and 200 ml of distilled water were placed in a 3 liter, stainless steel autoclave equipped with a stirrer and a thermometer, and air was supplied until the internal pressure in the autoclave became 1.0 kg cmê gauge pressure at room temperature. Then the valve was locked up, and the mixture thus prepared was subjected to reaction at a temperature of 1100C for 5 hours with strong stirring. Thereafter, the reaction mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature, after which the contents were taken out of the autoclave.To the contents were added 50 ml of distilled water and 1,500 ml of petroleum ether, and the resulting mixture was sufficiently stirred. The separated petroleum ether layer and the precipitates were removed, and the residue obtained was concentrated to dryness, to obtain 139 g of a light yellow powder. The powder was subjected to extraction with petroleum ether by use of a Soxhlet s extractor for 1 hour to extract and remove the unreacted materials, after which the residue was dried and then dissolved in 300 ml of glacial acetic acid, and an acetic acid insoluble fraction consisting of inorganic salts was removed by filtration. The thus obtained acetic acidsoluble fraction was concentrated to obtain 129 g of whitish yellow solid. This solid was purified by extraction with ethanol to obtain the sodium salt of sulfonated toluene adduct of cyclopentadiene.The sodium salt is named Sample 13 . Subsequently, 60 millimoles of Sample 13 and 80 millimoles of sulfuric acid were charged into a 0.2 liter, three necked flask equipped with a stirrer and a thermometer, and subjected to reaction at 1000C for 3 hours. Thereafter, 10 cc of n heptane was added, and the azeotropic removal of n heptane and H2O was carried out at 1100C for 2 hours and then at 800C under reduced pressure. The product thus obtained is named Sample 14 . Subsequently, 6.3 g of H20 was poured intoSample 14 t60 millimoles , and 5.35 g 66 millimoles of a 37 aqueous formaldehyde solutoin was added dropwise at 80 C over a period of 3 horus, after which the temperature was raised to 1000C, and reaction was effected for 20 hours to obtain a viscous condensate. The condensate was dissolved in 100 g of water, and the pH of the resulting solution was adjusted to 7 by the addition of 11 g of CaCO3, after which the thus formed white precipitates were separated by filtration. To the filtrate was further added 3.2 g of Na2CO3, and the resulting white precipitates were removed by filtration.The filtrate is named Sample 15 . For the thus obtained Samples 14 and 15, the proportions of sulfonic acid per mole of the toluene adduct of dicyclopentadiene were measured by a conventional method to find that they were 1.92 moles and 1.75 moles, respectively, so that it became apparent that the degree of sulfonation with respect to the skeleton was about 2. Elementary analysis was carried out for Sample 14 to obtain the following results carbon 51.2 , hydrogen 5.3 , sulfur 15.4 , oxygen 23.2 , which were in good agreement with the theoretical values for the disulfonation product, C 50.0 , H 5.1 , S 15.7 , 0 23.5 . The number average molecular weight ofSample 15 was 6,300 as measured by GPC.Subsequently, the result of infrared analysis of Sample 15 is shown inFig. 5, from which it can be seen that absorptions due to sulfonic acid group at 1,050 cm 1 and 1,190 cm 1 are very strong and that an absorption due to methylene group at 1,450 cm 1 is also strong. This indicates that the condensation proceeded and that Sample 15 is a sulfonation product The surface tension of a 4 aqueous solutoin ofSample 15 was as very high as 63 dyn cm and the solution was only slightly foamed. Example 30 By the same procedure as in Example 29, 89 g of a sulfonation product of the xylene adduct of dicyclopentadiene was obtained. The sulfonation product was subjected to disulfonation and then condensation in the same manner as inExample 29. The acid values of the disulfonation product and the condensate were 1.76 moles and 1.58 moles, respectively, per mole of the skeleton. The surface tension of a 4 aqueous solutoin of the condensate was as high as 61 dyn cm. The number average molecular weight of the condensate was 4,500.Example 31 The same procedure as in Example 29 was repeated, except that the amount of Sample 14 was changed from 60 millimoles to 45 millimoles and that Sample 14 was condensed with 15 millimoles of phenol. The number average molecular weight of the resulting condensate was 7,800, and the surface tension of a 4 aqueous solution of the condensate was as high as 58 dyn cm.Example 32 The same procedure as in Example 29 was repeated, except that the amount of Sample 14 was changed from 60 millimoles to 30 millimoles and that 30 millimoles of Sample 13 was substituted for the balance and condensed with Sample 14. The number average molecular weight of the resulting condensate was 6,800, and the surface tension of a 48 aqueous solution of the condensate was as high as 58 dynlcm. Example 33 The same procedure as in Example 29 was repeated, except that the amount of Sample 14 was changed from 60 millimoles to 30 millimoles and that 30 millimoles of B naphthalenesulfonic acid was substituted for the balance and condensed with Sample 14. The number average molecular weight of the resulting condensate was 8,900, and the surface tension of a 4 aqueous solution of the condensate was as very high as 67 dyn cm.Example 34 To 200 g of commercially available Portland cement manufactured by Chichibu Cement Co., Ltd. were added 2 g of each of the condensates obtained inExamples 29 to 33 and 50 g of distilled water, and the resulting mixture was kneaded by hand for 3 minutes.Thereafter, the flow values were measured by use of a flow corn with an inner volume of 98.9 cc according toJIS R5201. The flow values and the specific gravities of green cement pastes are shown in Table 5. It can be seen therefrom that in this case the cement showed excellent dispersability and no air entraining property.Comparative Example The same flow test as in Example 34 was repeated, except that the condensates of this invention were not added.
