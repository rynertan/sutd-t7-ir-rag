# CHARGE TRANSFER DEVICES FOR MULTIPLEXING SIGNALS.

## Abstract
This is a signal synthesizing charge transfer device which can, in particular, synthesize signals even if the circuits output circuit, level adjusting circuit necessary for syn thesizing the signals are omitted. For that purpose, at least first and second transfer channels 34 , 35 for transferring signal charges and a third transfer channel 36 for synthesiz ing alternately the signal charges transferred in the channels 34 , 35 , are provided. The same transfer clock f
