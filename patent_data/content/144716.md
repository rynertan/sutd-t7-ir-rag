# Copolymerization of ethylene.

## Abstract
Ethylene is copolymerized with one or more 1 olefins under conditions of high temperature and pressure in the presence of an inert gaseous ratio modifier. As a result, liquid condensation which contributes to equipment damage and unsafe operation is avoided, and copolymer product density is readily controllable.
