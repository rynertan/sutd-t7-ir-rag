# MEANS FOR MOUNTING A TELESCOPIC SLIDE IN A RACK OR CABINET

## Abstract
To secure a telescopic slide to an apertured flange 2 of a rack or cabinet without using the caged nuts previously used, a bracket 20 is used, the bracket 20 having opposed flanges 26 which receive the telescopic slide between them and having an end flange 15 with apertures therein preferably formed by a pierce and plunge operation with subsequent screwthreading. Moulded rectangular section members 28 each have a countersunk aperture therein, a rearward portion which engages in an aperture 11 in the flange 2 of the rack or cabinet and a front flange which only projects a small distance P forwardly of the front face of the flange 2 of the rack or cabinet. Screws 33 secure the members 28 to the bracket 20 with the flange 2 of the rack or cabinet clamped therebetween.
