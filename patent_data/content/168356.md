# A device for automatically restarting the engine of a motor vehicle after sudden braking.

## Abstract
The device comprises first electrical speed sensor means 1,2 for providing electrical signals indicative of the speed of rotation of at least one driven wheel of the motor vehicle, second electrical speed sensor means 7 for providing electrical signals indicative of the speed of rotation of the engine, third electrical speed sensor means 8 for providing electrical signals indicative of the speed of the motor vehicle, means 4 for indicating the condition of braking of the motor vehicle, and an electronic monitoring and control unit 3 connected to the sensor and indicator means. The electronic monitoring and control unit 3 is arranged to actuate the electric starter motor 11 of the internal combustion engine when, as a result of panic braking, the driven wheels become locked, the engine stalls while the vehicle is still in motion, and the indicator means show that the braking force has been at least partially reduced. Thus the driven wheels are turned again and, consequently, the stability and correct handling of the motor vehicle are regained.
