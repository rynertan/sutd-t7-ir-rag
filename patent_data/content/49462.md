# MEMORY DEVICE

## Abstract
A memory device, which comprises a capacitor 20 connected to a power supply terminal 10 through a main switch 12 to be used as a data holding power source and also connected to a read write memory 24 . The memory device further comprises a comparator 22 which compares the level of the terminal voltage of the capacitor 20 with a minimum level of the data holding voltage of the memory 24 and a transistor 16 which is connected between the main switch 12 and capacitor 20 and rendered conducting in accordance with an output signal from the comparator 22 .
