# Noble metal alloy front surface coating of silver reflectors.

## Abstract
A partially transparent, noble metal protective overcoat is provided to a front surface silver reflector. The overcoat, preferably of gold, may be applied by vacuum deposition or electrodeposition. Optimum overcoat thickness is the mini mum required to protect the reflector in the environment of its intended use. The overcoated reflector of this invention is particularly well suited for the surface of a laser pump cavity.
