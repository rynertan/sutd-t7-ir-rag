# SELF REFERRING TYPE OF OPTICAL COMMUNICATION SYSTEM

## Abstract
A self referring type of optical communication system for a pulse code modulation optical system is such that when the presence or absence of pulses forms a signal ac cording to polarisation wave angles, reference is made to the polarisation wave angle of a pulse a predetermined number of bits earlier than the given pulse, and a pulse code is determined from whether or not these polarisation wave angles match.
