# Polarity guard circuit.

## Abstract
Four bipolar transistors 28, 30, 32, 34 are arranged in a bridge configuration and are interconnected with two additional bipolar transistors 38, 46 to provide an efficient polarity guard circuit 10 . The circuit has two output terminals 16, 18 , one of which has a positive polarity regardless of the polarity across two input terminals 12, 14 . The two additional transistors 38, 46 prevent collector to base current from flowing through any of the bridge transistors 28, 30, 32, 34 which may be biased off.
