# A nickel based alloy and castings made therefrom.

## Abstract
The present invention provides a metallurgically stable alloy having a good combination of high temperature stress rupture strength ductility and corrosion and oxidation resistance, particularly for use in cast form as turbine engine hardware. The alloy contains from 0 to 0.2 carbon, from 11.5 to 12.2 chromium, from 4 to 8 cobalt, from 4.5 to 5.2 total molybdenum plus tungsten with the ratio of molybdenum to tungsten being from 1.2 to 1.8, from 8.8 to 9.7 total aluminium plus titanium with the ratio of aluminium to titanium being from 0.8 to 1.1, from 0 to 0.4 boron and from 0 to 0.1 zirconium, the balance being essentially nickel.
