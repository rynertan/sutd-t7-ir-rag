# Combined coal liquefaction gasification process.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a combination coal liquefaction gasification process wherein hydrocarbonace ous mineral residue containing slurry 58 from the liquefac tion zone 22, 26 is recycled to the liquefaction zone and all non recycled hydrocarbonaceous mineral residue containing slurry 74 is passed to a gasification zone 76 for conversion to synthesis gas to supply hydrogen 92 for the liquefaction zone 22, 26 . It has now been discovered that in this process a surprisingly high reaction selectivity in favor of the desired distillate oil product is achieved by combining low liquefac tion zone residence times and relatively high rates of recycle of mineral residue containing slurry compared to feed coal rate. Under these conditions the yield of the desired distillate oil product can be increased to an unexpectedly high level while the yields of both higher and lower boiling products are each being decreased and while hydrogen consumption is being reduced.
