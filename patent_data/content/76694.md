# 4 POLE ELECTRIC MOTOR

## Abstract
A 4 pole armature 12 is accommodated within a 4 pole permanent magnet ring 10, either the ring or armature serving as the rotor. The core 16 of the armature is cross shaped, and two opposite members of the core have windings 18 applied to them with opposite winding direc tions. The cross shaped core 16 is provided on at least one, and possibly both, opposite pair of core ends with back up core elements 20 extending in the rotational direction of the armature or in the direction opposite to the rotational direction oi the ring. A commutator 22, 24, 26 or the like device for converting armature polarity is provided which alternates the direction of electric current for the armature every 90 rotation of the rotor.
