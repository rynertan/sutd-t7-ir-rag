Verfahren zur Entfernung von Sterolen aus Fett und oder Öl, wobei das Verfahren die Schritte umfaßt, daß das Fett und oder Öl in flüssigem Zustand gehalten wird und das flüssige Fett und oder Öl mit einem absorbierenden oder adsorbierenden Material in Kontakt gebracht wird, wobei das absorbierenden oder adsorbierende Material und die Einwirkzeit des Absorptionsmittels oder Adsorptionsmittels auf das Fett oder Öl derart ist, daß im wesentlichen alle Sterole, insbesondere Cholesterin, aus dem Fett und oder Öl nur durch Adsorption und oder Absorption entfernt werden, wobei das absorbierende oder adsorbierende Material nicht Tonsil ist.

## Description
It is an object of the present invention to provide a method of removing sterols from fats and oils and or fats and oils from which sterols have been removed, which will at least provide the public with a useful choice. The prior art does not in general deal with the removal of cholesterol but uses, in particular, adsorbents for the removal of odoriferous materials and relates to selective adsorption of triglyceride US A 4,277,412 using adsorbents at a lower contact time than envisaged in the present invention. WO83 01782 which also refers to US A 2976156 and US A 3955004 describes the use of an adsorbent but not repeatedly or for an extended contact time. Fette, Seifen, Austrichmittel , Vol 76, No. 10, 1974, pp433 435 discloses that the use of Tonsil, a bleaching earth, used in the refining of fats and oils gives rise in the presence of cholesterol to the production of unwanted cholesterol derivatives. US A 3450541 discloses the use of digitonin carried by celite to remove cholesterol from lipids. The cholesterol reacts with the digitonin to form an insoluble digitonide complex. According to the present invention there is provided a method of removing sterols from fat and or oil, said method comprising the steps of maintaining the fat and or oil in liquid condition and contacting the liquid fat and or oil with an absorbent or adsorbent material, the absorbent or adsorbent material and the time of exposure of the fat or oil to the absorbent or adsorbent being such as to remove substantially all sterols, especially cholesterol, from the fat and or oil, by adsorption and or absorption only, wherein the absorbent or adsorbent material is not Tonsil. The invention also comprises an oil and or fat which has been treated in accordance with the method of the present invention. One preferred form of the invention will now be described. In the preferred form of the invention it is broadly envisaged that an oil and or fat for example fats and oils of vegetable and or animal origin including fish fats and or oils is treated and we will describe the preferred form in relation to the removal of cholesterol from anhydrous milkfat. To put the method into operation, the oil and or fat is maintained at a temperature which maintains the fat and or oil liquid and preferably one which reduces the viscosity of the liquid fats and oils to a value which facilitates adsorption or absorption of the sterols on to or into the active adsorbents or absorbents. Preferably the treating material comprises an adsorbent which include active carbons, earths and clays either pulverised or granulated, in other words in a particulate condition. During the process above described some oils and fats may lose their characteristic flavour, colour and oxidative stability. After deodorization for example by using equipment common to the vegetable oil industry, undesirable flavours are removed from the treated oil or fat. Both desired colour, flavour and oxidative stability may be added back using natural, nature identical or artifical components. The process may be effected either as a continuous or batch system and as an example, in the continous method, hot milkfat for example anhydrous milkfat at 70 90 C is slowly percolated through a column of granulated 12 x 40 mesh, particle diameter range of 420 µm to 1.68 mm active carbon type APC trade mark , Calgon Corp., U.S.A. . At least the initial fractions obtained were substantially cholesterol free. In a batch procedure, a quantity of milk fat again preferably anhydrous milkfat held at 70 90 C is vigorously stirred with 2.5 active pulverized carbon type NAP trade mark Calgon Corp., U.S.A. for one hour. After this period of time the pulverized carbon is removed by filtration and the process is repeated a number of times until the milkfat is cholesterol free or substantially free of cholesterol. It will be seen that by the processes above described or either of them a product is achieved which has had sterols removed therefrom. In the examples given, the undesirable compound which is removed is cholesterol. This has considerable advantages in industry. In a more elaborate continuous procedure a pulsed bed of APC trade mark granulated carbon 10 x 40 mesh, particle diameter range of 420 µm to 2 mm. is used. Anhydrous milkfat AMF at an elevated temperature e.g. 80 c is pumped at a controlled rate up through the carbon column. The carbon column is pulsed i.e. a fresh portion of granulated carbon is added to the top of the column and an equivalent portion of spent carbon removed from the bottom of the column at intervals selected to maintain the desired level of cholesterol zero or relatively low in the treated AMF. The treated AMF can then be deodorized in a vegetable oil deodorizer and stabilized against oxidative deterioration by the addition of a suitable antioxidant S preferably natural such as Eastmans USA Tenx GT 1 or Vitamin E 4 50. Yellow colour B Carotene can be restored by the addition of B Carotene Roche Switzerland . Eastmans , Tenx and Roche are trade marks. A suitable milkfat is thus obtained which has been used for the manufacture of a wide range of products including dairy products which have zero or low levels of cholesterol i.e. butters, cheeses, cottage cheeses, ice creams, and low cholesterol liquid milks of varying fat content. Where necessary flavour natural, nature identical or artifical has been used in the formulation of the products in order to restore the expected flavour of the product which was absent due to the initial treatment of the AMF.
