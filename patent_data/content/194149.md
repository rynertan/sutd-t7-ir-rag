# Magnetic tape recording apparatus.

## Abstract
When a standby command is issued in a long period recording intermittent recording mode, a control circuit 70 stops the rotation of a rotating drum 60 and a capstan shaft 72 with a magnetic tape 20 being maintained in a loaded state. Then, a back tension arm 310 is moved and rotating torques are applied to a feed reel 11 and a take up reel 12 in opposite directions, whereby a prescribed back tension is applied to the magnetic tape 20.
