# MACHINE FOR LASTING SIDE PORTIONS OF SHOES

## Abstract
The machine comprises a shoe support 20 on which a shoe can be positioned, and which includes a toe end engaging member 48 which senses the shoe length, two abutment faces 84, 90 being set according to shoe length sensed. The machine also comprises adhesive applying nozzles 262 and side lasting rolls 224 mounted on a carriage 216 for movement relative to the shoe support. The start position of the nozzles is set by valves 334, 336 actuated by cams 330, 332 positioned by a sensing member 326 engaging with one abutment face 84 . Various other machine operations, which take place at the ball region of the shoe bottom, the position of which region thus varies proportionately with shoe length, are controlled by further valves 354, 356 actuated by cams 350, 352 carried on a control rod 344 the position of which is determined by a sensing member 338 engaging the other abutment face 90 , an appropriate length grading arrangement 342 connecting said member and said control rod. The position of the abutment face 84 can be adjusted by the operator to accommodate different shoe styles.
