There are known methods of manufacturing high molecular materials of small specific resistance, consisting in doping polymers with large quantities of mineral matter such as carbon black or metallic powders0 These methods need applying com ples technology, and besides, the presence of arnixtures ag gravates mechanical and optical properties of matrix polymer. The above methods have been described in a book Conduc tive Rubbers ar.d Plastics by R.H.Norman, Fisevler PublishingCo., 1970, in the British Patent No 828 233 and in a monograph Carbon Black Composites E.K.Sicher, M.Dekker, Physïes ofElectricelly Conducting Composites, Ins. New York, 1982 . One also knows methods of manufacturing polymer mixture with the admixtures of organic matter capable of forming complexes with charge transfer, being characterized.by molecule diffusion of admixtures in the polymer, revealing photoconduçtive properties and having large specific. resistance in darkness Polish Patent No 92 245 . There are knovm methods of manufacturing polymers with organic admixtures forming complexes with charge transfer of over 20 by weight. One also knows methods of manufacturing conducting polyniers with the admixtures of low molecular complexes of tetracyanoquinodimethane of 20 40 by weight and even more.These methods have been described in the following papers Mirogushi, Nippon Kagaku Kaishi, 7, 1029 1977 S. Ikono, It. Matsumoto, M. Yokoyma, H. Mikawa, Polymer I, 9, 261 1977 J. vdshimoto, U. Hayaski, M. Hashimoto, T. Ohshima, J. Appl. Polyp. sci., 21, 2721 f19771and 24, 465 1979 , as well as in the American Patent No 3 632 526. The doping of polymers with such large quatities of admixturves enable manufacturing materiai of small specific resist ance but aggravates substantially mechanical, tnermal and op tical properties. The Polish Patent To 116 850 presents the method of melu fracturing high mol cular electrically conducting material, consisting in doping the dissolved polymer with the admixtures of organic matter of small molecular weight capable of forming complex with charge thansfer, being called organic metals .Materials obtained in this way are characterized by small spe ciflc resistance but the applied admixtures of organic metals are very expensive, often more expensive than gold. This con cerns especially donors like tetratiotetracene, tetratioful valene, tetraselenofulvalene and tetraselenotetracene. Moreover, the solvents used in manufacturing those materials, e.g. chlorobenzene or o dichlorobenzene are liquids of high boiling point. High temperature causes some difficulties that are connected with the removal of solvent from the conductive materïal, the preserce of which may influence stability of these systems, According to the invention, the method of manufacturing high molecular electrically conducting material consists in that the polymer is being dissolved in solvent and then one adds 0.1 5 by weight in relation to polymer of the admixture of high molecular compound containing iterative monomeric units of general formula 1, where R1 denotes the methyl group, R2 denòtes independently of the groupformula 2, the group of formula 3 or the group of formula CH2 7, where x denotes the number 3 10, A denotes independently the atom of sulphur, nitrogen, phosphorus or arsenic, im being O if A denotes the sulphur atom or m being 1 if A denotes the atom of nitrogen, phosphorus or arsenic, or the substituent A is a heteroatom in in the aron atic ring of formula 4 the substituent R2 denotes then independently the group of forr ala a CH2 xs where 7 is as above, the group of formula CH CH or CH CH2 , x denotes nion radical from tile group of acceptors capable of forming high conductivity complex with charge transfer, com prising 7, 7, 8, 8 tetracyanoquinodimethane TC TQ , its derivatives such as dibromotetracyanoquinodimethane, tetrafluorotetracyanoquinodimethane and dichlorotetracyanoquinodimethane, tetracyanonaphthaloquinodimethane, o chloranil, p benzoquinone and x denotes neutral molecule from the group of acceptors of capable forming high conductivity complexes with charge transfer, comprising 7, 7, 8, 8 tetracyanoquinodimethane TCNQ , its derivatives such as dibromotetracyanoquinodimethane, tetrafluorotetracyanoquinodimethane and dichlorotetracyanoquinodimethane, tetracyanonaphtaloquinodimethane, o chloranil, pEMI4.1 has the value given Theobtaind.solution is then being spread onto a base and the solvent is being evaporated, the temperature of the base being chosen so as to get the material with the crystallized admixture of conducting complex salt after complete evaporation of the solvent. An alternative procedure carried on accoraing to the in Invention consists in that the polymer is being dissolved in solvent and then one adds 0.1 5 by weigbt in relation to polymer of the admixture of high molecular compound containing iterative monomeric units of general formula 1, where the sub stituents have the denotation given above with the molar ratioEMI4.2 equal to 0 and one adds 0.1 3 by weight in relation to polymer of neutral molecules from the group of acceptors capable of forming high conductivity complexes with charge transfer, comprising 7, 7, 8, 8 tetracyanoquinodimethane, its derivatives such as dibromotetracyanoquinodimethane, tetrafluorotetracyanoquinodimethane and dichlorotetracyanoqiino dimethane, tetracyanonaphthaloquinodimethane, o chloranil, p benzoquinone. The obtained solution is then being spread onto Åa base andthe solvent is being evaporated, the temperature of the base being chosen so as to get the material with the admixture of conducting complex salt after complete evaporation of the solvent the former belongs to the group of acceptors capable of forming high conductivity complexes with charge transfer, comprising 7, 7, 8, 8 tetracyanoquinodimethane, its derivatives such as dibromotetracyanoquinodimethane, tetrafluorotetracyano quinodimethane and dichlorotetracyanoquinodimethane, tetra cyanonaphthaloquinodimethane, o chloranil, p bersoquinone that are not formed before obtaining the material. The solvents used according to the invention are chosen so that the admixtures should also dissolve in them and should not form complexes either with the.solvent or with the polymer. high molecular admixtures used according to the invention are oligomers and high molecular compounds containing 5 50 or more iterative monomeric units of the above given formula 1.
