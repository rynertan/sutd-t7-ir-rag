It has been found that the novel morpholinol compounds represented by formula I EMI1.1 wherein Y is hydrogen or fluorine and R is hydrogen or alkyl C1 4 , and salts thereof, have antidepressant activity as demonstrated by widely accepted techniques used in the art of pharmacology for determining antidepressant activity, for example, the tetrabenazine induced sedation test in rodents.Advantageously the compounds of this invention do not produce any significant degree of locomotor stimulation and are essentially free of proconvulsant activity even at doses near to or in excess of the LD50.Structural formula I should be understood to extend to and embrace all geometric and optical isomers. As preferred within formula I may be mentioned i compounds wherein R is hydrogen or alkyl C2 4 ii compounds having the cis configuration iii compounds wherein R is hydrogen iv cis 3, 5 Strimethyl 2 phenyl 2 morpholinol compound IA v cis 2 4 fluorophenyl 3,5,5 trimethyl 2 morpholinol compound IB and salts thereof.The compounds of formula I may be synthesized by the methods known in the art for the preparation of compounds having this type of structure. 1 Thus as one possibility a compound of formula t can be made by reacting a compound of formula II with a compound of formula III wherein Y and R are as defined for formula I and L is a suitable leaving atom or group such as halo for example, bromo or arylsulfonyloxy for example, p toluenesulfonyloxy J in a suitable solvent such as acetonitrile, ethanol, methanol or dichloromethane.EMI2.1 EMI3.1 2 Compounds of formula I wherein R is alkyl can also be made by either alkylating, or acylating and then selectively reducing, the corresponding compound of formula I wherein R is hydrogen, using methods well known in the art of organic chemistry. For example, alkylation with methyliodide gives the compoundsof formula I where R is methyl acylation with acetyl chloride followed by reduction with diborane in tetrahydrofuran gives the compounds where R is ethyl.The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be used in the prophylaxis or treatment of a depressed state in mammals including human beings, the treatment comprising the administration of an antidepressant effective, non toxic amount dose , preferably in a unit dosage form, of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The compounds and salts may also be used to treat human beings for tardive dyskinesia TD , and minimal brain dysfunction MBD .The preferred dosage for parenteral including subcutaneous, intramuscular and intravenous administration of a compound of formula I or salt thereof estimated a the base is in the range 5 mg kg to 50 mg kg of mammal body weight, the most preferred dosage being 15 mg kg to 35 mg kg of mammal body weight. For the oral or rectal mode of administration, the preferred dosage of a compound of formula I or salt thereof estimated as the base is in the range 10 mg kg to 100 mg kg of mammal body weight while the most preferred dosage is 30 mg kg to 70 mg kg of mammal body weight.For the treatment of human beings, the preferred unit dosage of a compound of formula I or salt thereof estimated as the base for oral or rectal administration is in the range 15 mg to 500 mg with the more preferred unit dosage being in the range 100 mg to 300 mg, and the most preferred unit dosage being in the range 125 mg to 250 mg. For parenteral treatment the preferred unit dosage is 4 mg to 200 mg with the more preferred unit dosage being in the range 50 mg to 175 mg, and the most preferred unit dosage being in the range of 100 mg to 150 mg.All the above doses are given in terms of the weight of the base but the compound of formula I is preferably administered in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.A compound of formula i or salt thereof is preferably administered four times daily although this may vary according to the patient mammal being treated, and the exercise of the physician s discretion.While it is possible for the active compound, i.e., compound of formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, to be administered alone as the raw chemical, it is preferable to present it as a pharmaceutical formulation comprising a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefor.
