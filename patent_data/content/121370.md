# Apparatus for monitoring particulate matter.

## Abstract
An apparatus for monitoring particulate matter in the fluid comprises a filter means 28 through which fluid is arranged to flow. A pressure sensing means 46 senses the fluid pressure difference across the filter means and produces a pressure signal indicative of the magnitude of the pressure difference. A processing means 49 receives the pressure signal and evaluates therefrom the rate of change of the mag nitude of the pressure difference in order to give an indication of particulate matter levels in the fluid. In this way on line monitoring of the debris generation in, for example a oil system, can be effected so that abnormal increases in debris can be detected and long term trends in the build up of debris can be observed. A particular form of filter medium is also disclosed wherein the filter mean can be transported so that a filter record can be maintained and systematic X ray analysis of the filter record can be effected.
