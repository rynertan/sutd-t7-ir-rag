# Polysiloxane composition with improved surface wetting characteristics and biomedical devices made thereof.

## Abstract
The surface wetting characteristics of polysiloxanes pre pared from monomeric polysiloxanes endcapped with activat ed unsaturated groups and modulus modifiers are improved by the inclusion of small amounts of an N alkenoyl trialkylsilyl ami nate. The improved polymeric compositions can be used to form hard, gas permeable contact lenses and other biomedical devices.
