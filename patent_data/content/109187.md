# Phosphorus containing hydrocarbon cracking catalyst and catalytic cracking process utilizing the same.

## Abstract
A phosphorus containing low alkali metal content zeo litic catalyst made from a clay starting material is provided. The catalyst is obtained by contacting a partially cation ex changed calcined zeolite containing catalyst with an anion such as a dihydrogen phosphate anion or a dihydrogen phosphite anion and additionally with an ammonium salt other than a salt of an inorganic acid of phosphorus. A hy drocarbon catalytic cracking process utilizing the phospho rus containing catalyst is also provided.
