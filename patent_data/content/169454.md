# Name usage support through distributed processing networks linked by bridges and or gateways.

## Abstract
For facilitating data communication between entities in a local area network storage files, programs, devices, human operators, etc. , a method is disclosed for addressing such communications to logical names adopted for the entities rather than to discrete physical locations in the network. The subject method allows for extension of name directed communications across bridges between separate communication media or between discrete frequency channels on one medium . Extensions of such communications across bridges are conditioned on the handling of respective communications within the channel or medium leading to respective bridges. If a named entity is reachable within a channel or medium leading to a bridge, the communication will be acknowledged by the processing facility at the node serving that entity, and the communication will not be extended. With the present method, a program running on a processor at one node of the network may call for retrieval of a data set by name, where the location of the data set need not be known or specifiable by either the program or the processor, and the respective data set may be retrieved through a process of communication which is entirely transparent to the program and processor, and also not ambiguous or burdensome when the network path to the named data set contains bridges and or gateways.

## Description
This invention relates to a method for causing name directed communications in a data communication network to be transferred selectively across bridging and or gateway elements which respectively link separate communication channels and or media within the network. As just used, the term name directed is intended to refer to communications which are directed to logical names rather than to specific locations addresses in the network. Such names are associatable with a variety of entities within the network, including physical objects computers, their I O attachments, human operators, network access adaptors, etc. and less tangible objects such as programs and data sets. For reasons which will become apparent as this description progresses, this invention operates most effectively in local area type network environments. In local area type network environments, data processing entities located at various network nodes a node being defined herein as a point of coupling to a communication medium or channel may operate in a distributed mode to establish unique and non unique name associations for entities served through respective nodes, and also to establish communication sessions i.e. logical connections between respectively served entities, without requiring intermediate translations of related communications through shared processing entities containing directory tables relating all names to physical address locations. Such related communications , as disclosed in European Patent Application 85104887.6, filed on April 23, 1985, are termed Name Check and Call Name Check messages, and are respectively used for enabling the processing system at an originating node to determine a if adoption of a name would conflict with uses of the same name elsewhere in the network and b if a called object of a communication session is reachable in the network by a name and distinguishable unambiguously from other entities. These messages are passed from originating nodes to network media and or channels, and examined by processing equipment at all respectively linked nodes. Each examining node performs a lookup comparison between a name in the message and names in a local Name Table the latter representing names adopted for locally attached entities , and returns an acknowledging message if a match is encountered. The acknowledgements are used by the originating equipment to determine the action to take with respect to related name adoption and session establishment processes complete or abort . The present invention concerns a method for selectively controlling the handling of such name checking communications, and related acknowledgements, across bridging gateway boundaries within the network. In the absence of present controls, the originating equipment would be responsible for defining hop count parameters restricting the passage across such boundaries in order to avoid the possibility of having such communications circulate redundantly through loops formed by sequentially linked media channels , and this would require considerable storage of information associated with network topology at all network nodes. Furthermore, the present restrictions permit networks to be dynamically expanded, by joinder of sub networks associated with separate media channels through added bridges, without inconveniencing users by requiring reestablishment of name associations and yet avoiding problems which would otherwise be encountered where the same name is used on a unique basis in plural sub networks. In the above mentioned preferred local network environment, equipment at any network node may use a datagram type message to distribute information restrictively to a select group of entities identified by a name contained in the message. Such messages differ from universally broadcast messages in that they require attention only at nodes serving the members of the named entity group the present invention makes special use of such datagram type messages for controlling handling of name creation and session establishment communications across bridges and gateways linking sub networks formed by equipment coupled to single media or channels such sub networks also being referred to herein as primitive networks , and distinguished thereby from complex networks characterized as networks formed by linkage of two or more primitive networks . One difficulty with managing the use of distributively created names in such networks is that as primitive networks are joined into larger complex networks, name associations adopted before the joinder may become ambiguous. Although this could be avoided by requiring cancellation and recreation of all name associations at joinder, this could be unwieldy or impractical in networks containing thousands of entities and name associations. Another problem is that joinder of primitive networks gives rise to the possibility of linking three or more media and or channels serially to form redundant circulation loops. It is possible to avoid redundant circulation of name directed communications in such loops, by requiring the originator of each such communication to add to its message a hop count parameter limiting the number of bridges gateways through which that communication can pass. However, this would require equipment at every network node to be able to store information effectively defining the entire topology of the network which would be a heavy storage burden for such equipment , and such information would have to be changed with each physical change of the network configuration a sizable communication burden . The present invention provides an efficient method of avoiding the foregoing problems, relative to the use of logical name directed communications in changeable complex networks. More particularly, the invention provides a method for facilitating handling of name directed messages in a data communication network having plural communication media or channels linked by bridging facilities, each medium or channel linking plural data processing stations, said stations being adapted for operating to share access to associated entities across the network and to initiate communications with remote entities by means of messages directed to logical names assigned to the entities and not to addresses representing specific physical locations of respective entities, said messages not requiring intermediate handling within the network for translating respective names to addresses, characterized in that it comprises at any one of said stations, originating a first name directed message and transmitting said message over a first medium or channel to which said station is directly coupled said first message containing a logical name and having a predetermined first form which restricts its handling so that the information therein is not transferred beyond said bridging facilities to media or channels other than said first medium or channel monitoring said first medium or channel at said one station for communications representing responses to said first message if no response to said first message is received at said one station, transmitting a second name directed message from said one station over said first medium or channel said second message corresponding to said first message but having a predetermined second form different from said first form said second form operating to allows responsive handling of the information contained in said message only at bridging facilities directly coupled to said first medium or channel monitoring said first medium or channel as said one station for responses to said second message at each bridging facility receiving said second message, conditionally generating a third message corresponding to the second message and having a third predetermined form transmitting said third messages from respective facilities to other media or channels which are linked by respective facilities to said first medium or channel monitoring said other media or channels at respective facilities for responses to respectively forwarded third messages and forwarding responses to said third messages directly to said one station, via said first medium or channel, for handling as responses to said second message. These and other aspects, features, advantages and benefits of the present invention may be more fully understood and appreciated by considering the following description and claims. Table of Contents Referring to FIGURE 1, primitive networks A D are linked into a complex network 10 by bridging facilities discussed below refer to the definitions of primitive and complex given previously . Each primitive network contains a respective medium channel 12A, 12B, 12C, 12D having respective nodes or taps 13A, 13B, 13C, 13D, such nodes serving respective communication and data processing facilities 14A, 14B, 14C, 14D. Bridging facilities shown at 15 18 link the media 12A 12D to form the complex configuration. Such bridging facilities may couple to respective media through nodes either physically separate from the nodes 13A 13D or they may reside physically within any of the facilities 14A 14D and share respective nodes. Each primitive network may serve multiple processing facilities or stations 14 through nodes 13 of the respective medium channel. Bridging facilities of the type represented at 15 18, but without the adaptations to be described presently for handling name directed communications, are well known in the art. Such facilities are described, for example, in U. S. Patents US A 4,287,592 and US A 4,365,331. To the extent that these descriptions may be relevant to the present disclosure, they are incorporated herein by this reference. In general, such facilities are connected to two media or two channels time or frequency divisions of one medium, and they operate to pass information bearing signals bidirectionally between associated media channels. These facilities may include programmed microprocessors and storage units permitting them to perform sophisticated buffering and format translation operations on information signals in transit between linked media channels. In the configuration exemplified in FIGURE 1, bridge facility 15 links media channels 12A and 12B, bridge 16 links media channels 12A and 12C, bridge 17 links media channels 12B and 12C, and bridge 18 links media channels 12C and 12D. The foregoing processing facilities 14A 14D operate through respective network nodes 13A 13D , in the manner described in the cross referenced co pending patent applications, to adopt logical alias names for respective entitles operators, programs, data sets, etc., served at the respective node sites . These names are characterized as logical because they need have no direct associations with physical locations of respective entities. The adoption procedure is characterized by communications over the network which do not require any intermediate handling to translate logical names into address parameters representing specific nodes or sites in the net work. In general, and ignoring the handling across bridges to be described later, such communications involve broadcast transmission of a Name Check message from the facility seeking to adopt a name, and monitoring of the message by the other facilities. Each facility 14A 14D maintains Name Tables defining name associations adopted at the respective facility, and each facility may act independently of the others to initiate a communication process for adoption of a new name association. The initiating facility broadcasts a Name Check message, as mentioned above, which contains the name which that facility proposes to adopt. Other facilities monitor the message, compare the message name to names in respective name tables, and return an acknowledging communication if a match is found. If no match is found, the monitoring facility ignores the Name Check. If a processor originating a Name Check receives one or more acknowledgements, and if the name sought to be adopted is intended to be used on a unique basis in the network . The originating processor recognizes a name conflict, rejects the name and ends the adoption process. If no acknowledgement is received, the name may be adopted entered into the processor s Name Table . A similar process pertains to session establishment. If, for instance, a program P, running on a processing facility at one node, requires access to a data set known by a particular name, the processing facility at the node executing P broadcasts a Call Name Check message directed to the needed data set by name. This message contains the logical names of the calling and called entities in this case P and the name of the needed data set . Processing facilities receiving this message check respective Name Tables, and return an acknowledging message if and only if an entry matching the called name is found. If the originating node receives no acknowledgements, it aborts the session call process. But if it receives an acknowledgement it continues the process with other communications until a session is established see the above referenced European Patent Application . Thus, the node serving P could retrieve the data set by name i.e. without any prior information as to the physical location of the data set in the network and therefore transparent to all program processes running on the node processors serving P and the required data set. Now suppose that in the complex network environment exemplified in FIGURE 1, the name assigned to a data set which is the object of a session call is used conflictingly in several primitive networks. This could occur, for instance, if previously isolated primitive networks were joined to form a complex configuration, and several of the joined networks contained nodes using the above mentioned data set name. This situation, and the problems it could present, are illustrated in FIGURE 2. Operator Bill , acting through keyboard display terminal 51 and software running on processing facility 52 application program, etc. may require access to a data set accounts receivable . Now assume that processor 52 is linked to network A as shown, and that the data set required by Bill s application is stored at 53 on a disk file 54 served by a processor 55 linked to network A. But assume also that other non pertinent data sets named accounts receivable are being maintained on networks B and D the one on network B stored at 60 on a disk file 61 accessible through processing facility 62, and the one on network D stored at 70 on disk file 71 accessible through processing facility 72. Now assume that when Bill s application program calls for accounts receivable , facility 52 checks its Name Table, determines that the required data set is not attached locally, and broadcasts a Call Name Check over medium 12A indicating Bill as the calling entity and accounts receivable as the called entity. If this message could be transferred through bridges without restriction, and monitored at nodes of all media 12A 12D, several problems occur. First, acknowledgements would be returned by facilities 55, 62 and 72 which to facility 52 could appear conflicting. Second, the Call Name Check message could circulate repeatedly through the loop formed by medium 12A, bridge 16, medium 12C, bridge 17, medium 12B, and bridge 15, and also through the loop formed by medium 12A, bridge 15, medium 12B, bridge 17, medium 12C and bridge 16. This situation would not have arisen if each facility such as 52 could restrict the number of bridges allowed to be crossed by its Call Name Check and Name Check communications e.g. by specifying a limiting hop count value of 1 see the cross referenced Distributed Control application , or if the network were structured to prevent conflicting name adoptions. However, these solutions present other problems. Requiring the originating facility to specify a hop count value imposes a burden on all processing facilities of maintaining information relative to network topology sufficient to ensure that loops formed by bridges are not fully traversed. But a network such as 10 may serve many processing facilities, and it may be changing dynamically as new primitive networks are added, so that maintenance of suitable topology information at each facility would be quite difficult. On the other hand, structuring the network to prevent conflicting name adoption would require re creation of all name associations after each network change which also would not be practical. The present invention provides a simpler solution, by organizing the processing facilities such as 52 to transmit their Name Check and Call Name Check communications in a series of discrete operations fanning out progressively through media and bridges further removed from the originating node. The fanning out process is transparent to the originating node, and requires the processing facilities at the bridges to bear the burden of determining hop count ranges for such communications. However, since such networks have far fewer bridging facilities than general purpose processing facilities, this tends to considerably lessen the processing burdens imposed on the non bridging nodes, as well as considerably reduce the related volumes of network traffic, in comparison to requiring all nodes to determine respective hop count restrictions. The technique used presently for controlling the foregoing fanout process involves transmission of Name Check and Call Name Check information in different first and second forms. These forms and the processes involved in their handling will be discussed at length later. For the present overview, it is observed that in the first form the information is arranged as a broadcast message which has a range of one primitive network medium or channel i.e. cannot pass across bridges , and in the second form, the information is encapsulated in a datagram see the cross referenced Non Unique Name application directed exclusively to bridges which are directly linked to the primitive medium. Upon originating a Name Check or Call Name Check communication in the first form, the processing facility at the respective origin node times out for a predetermined first time period allowing for acknowledgements to return from nodes within the primitive range of that communication. If no acknowledgements are received, this communication and timeout procedure may be repeated one or more times, up to a predetermined retry limit. This type of repetition is generally desirable, because these name checking requests are transmitted in a broadcast mode. Therefore, an error in the transmission or reception of the associated signals could cause the receiving processor to mis interpret and mis handle the request for instance, an error in transfer of the message type information or the name to be checked could cause a node having a potential name match to ignore the message . If one or more acknowledgements are received, the action taken by the originating facility depends on the related communication process name adoption or session establishment . If the process is for name adoption, and if the proposed name is intended for use on a unique basis, receipt of acknowledgement represents a conflict, and the name is rejected. If the process is for session establishment, acknowledgement represents confirmation of the existence of the called entity within the directly linked primitive network, and the process is continued with other communications, over the same primitive network, which are not relevant to the present invention see the Distributed Control reference . If a processing facility originating a Name Check or Call Name Check broadcast first form communication receives no acknowledgement after all repetitions if the first form broadcast is repeated up to a retry limit , it sends the same information out over its primitive net medium in the second form. In this form, the information is encapsulated in a datagram directed to the name bridge , and is given special interpretive handling at each bridge facility linked to the originating facility through a primitive net. In such handling, each bridge extracts the information constituting the original Name Check or Call Name Check broadcast and re broadcasts that information in its original first form. The bridge processing facility then times out for a predetermined time period allowing for acknowledgement by nodes linked to the bridged medium. If a bridge which has re broadcast a Name Check or Call Name Check receives one or more acknowledgements, it forwards the first acknowledgment to the originating node via the medium channel linked to that node . If more than one acknowledgement is received, and if that represents a network conflict, the bridge processor determines the nature of the conflict and issues a communication over the bridged medium remote from the originating node, informing acknowledging nodes of the conflict. If no acknowledgements are received, the action taken by the bridge facility depends on its hop count distance from the originating node a bridge directly linked to the originating node via a common medium or channel is at a hop count distance of 0, and bridges linked through additional media or channels are at higher valued hop count distances directly corresponding to the number of intervening additional media or channels . A bridge at hop count 0 distance, which receives no acknowledgement of the foregoing re broadcast, consults a local table of network topology, and if the medium or channel to which it links is not coupled to a further bridge one further removed from the originating node the bridge terminates its handling of the respective Name Check or Call Name Check communication. If a bridge at 0 hop count distance receives no acknowledgement, and is capable of reaching a further bridge without looping i.e. without passing through another bridge at 0 hop count distance from the origin node , it forms a second datagram containing a hop count value related to the number of further bridges which can be successively reached from this bridge without looping. Each bridge receiving the above mentioned second datagram decrements the hop count and repeats the process performed by the proceding bridge relative to a respective further removed medium or channel i.e. re broadcasting the Name Check or Call Name Check timing out for acknowledgements, relaying the first acknowledgement if one is received, and if none is received, either extending the process to the next level of bridging, if the hop count value is not 0, or concluding the process . At any level of bridge handling, termination of an extended and unacknowledged communication handling process requires no further communication back to the originating node. The absence of such acknowledgement is effectively inferred by the originating node due to a timeout process conducted at that node. The latter timeout is established in accordance with a process timeout parameter determined by inter action between the non bridging and bridging nodes when any non bridging node is first activated on the network. Before a newly activated non bridging node can enable itself for name adoption or session establishment communications i.e. Name Check or Call Name Check broadcasts , it is required by protocol to send an initial datagram addressed to bridges and containing a request for timeout initialization. The processing facilities at bridges distinguish such initial requests from datagrams containing encapsulated Name Check or Call Name Check functions by checking local tables and recognizing that the origin node is in an uninitiated state see Setting Of Node Timeouts infra . The local table at each bridge receiving this request datagram i.e. each bridge at hop count distance 0 from the requesting node contains information related to the topology of the network on either side of the bridge, which is stored when the network is either initialized or reconfigured. In response to an initialization request, the bridge processor consults its table, and extracts a process delay factor which is sent back to the node requesting initialization in a response message. This delay factor is just larger than the projected worst case delay in signal propagation and information handling between the request originator and the most distant node accessible through the respective bridge without passing through a further bridge forming a looping path back to the originator. The processing facility at the node requesting initialization examines the returned delay factors and selects the largest value as its process timeout function. In subsequent name adoption and session establishment operations, the respective facility uses this function to set a time limit for receiving acknowledgements. Thus, if any bridge completes its handling of a respective Name Check or Call Name Check operation without receiving an acknowledgement, and thereby terminates its handling of the operation, the termination will fall within the timeout set at the originating node and effectively dealt with as an absence of acknowledgement. Each node is also initialized with a primitive timeout function, for timing its Name Check and Call Name Check operations relative to its primitive network. This function is related to the longest propagation and processing delay normally anticipated within the respective primitive network. A node originating a Name Check or Call Name Check, and receiving no acknowledgement within the interval measured by its primitive timeout factor, effectively may infer that that communication will not be acknowledged, and proceed accordingly with the next appropriate action retry the communication, send bridge datagram, etc. FIGURES 3 and 4 illustrate formats of presently relevant Name Check, Call Name Check and datagram communication functions. Name Check and Call Name Check have control fields 100 105 which include destination field 100, origin address field 101, type field 102, hop count field 103, name field 104 and other information 105. The value in the type field distinguishes between Name Check and Call Name Check functions N1 for Name Check N2 for Call Name Check . The value in the destination field indicates a broadcast destination for both types of functions or it may be treated as a don t care value if the type field values N1 and N2 are taken to imply broadcast handling . As broadcast type communications, these functions require special treatment, since traditional broadcast type functions are usually not acknowledged and these functions require conditional acknowledgement if the name field 104 matches a name in the receiving node s Name Table . The origin address 101 is the address of the node originating the communication. It is used as the destination address in not shown acknowledgements see cross referenced Distributed Control application for information on acknowledgement formats . The name field contains either a name proposed for adoption, if the communication is a Name Check, or the name of an entity which is the object of a session call if the communication is a Call Name Check. The rest of the information, field 105, depends on the communication type. For Call Name Check, this includes the caller s name the entity for which the session is being called , and for both types N1 and N2 it includes various numbers permitting acknowledgers to identify the communication and the matched name with abbreviated codes as in any contemporary communication system, it is expected that each node may issue a number of communications of this nature with overlapping timeouts thus, it is important to be able to identify individual communications and their names, and being able to do so with abbreviated codes is obviously efficient . Datagram type communications contain control fields 120 125 which direct their handling at receiving nodes. The type N3 distinguishes datagrams see the Non Unique application previously referenced from other forms of communication. The destination is indicated as broadcast , but the accompanying other information is processed only at nodes which have Name Table matches for the non unique datagram name which, for datagrams presently of interest, would be bridge or a name having similar meaning of association with bridging nodes . The origin address is the address of the node originating the datagram transmission. The other information in the bridge type datagram includes either a request for initialization sent by a non bridging node or the content of a previously unacknowledged Name Check or Call Name Check communication. The values set in hop count fields 103 and 123 depend on the nature of the communication and its origin. Field 103 is either to be ignored treated as don t care condition or set to a 0 value if the respective Name Check Call Name Check originates at a non bridging node. If the respective Name Check or Call Name Check originates at a bridging node, field 123 is always set to 0. Field 123 is set to 0 if the datagram originates at a non bridging node. If the datagram is one issued from a bridging node, its value will depend on the position of the respective node in the network path through which the respective information is being handled. If the node is the first bridge in the handling path, the value set will be one selected by that bridge. If the datagram is issued by a bridge other than a first bridge, the value in field 123 will depend on the number of preceding bridges which have handled the same information i.e., the value is decremented by the first bridge and each subsequent bridge . In the preferred environmental system, each node includes a processing facility e.g., an IBM Personal Computer and supporting microprocessing equipment for performing general purpose data processing operations, and signalling operations relative to local area networks e.g., networks of the type described in the referenced U.S. Patent 4,365,331 to Biba et al. Such facilities operate under the direction of super visory and application programs of presently well known form to perform such operations. When a node s processing facility arrives at a stage of a task or process where it requires a name related operation presently of interest either adoption of a name for a locally served entity, or initiation of a session i.e., logical connection between a locally served entity and another entity known only by a logical name, it performs the name checking process which is described next with reference to Figures 5 7. FIGURE 5 describes the process of name checking communication generally. FIGURE 6 details parts of the process of FIGURE 5 relating to handling of timeout and acknowledgements at the node originating a name checking communication. FIGURE 7 details the handling of datagram communications at various network nodes in the present environment. This process, which may require plural discrete stages of data handling and signal communication, is used to check if the object entity name i.e., the name proposed for adoption, or the name which represents the object of a session call , has conflicting or ambiguous usage in the network i.e., if a name proposed for adoption is assigned to another entity, or if the object of a session call can be contacted by the Call Name Check name. On determining that its current task requires name usage step 140, Fig. 5 , the processing facility checks a local name table 141, Fig. 5 also refer to the Distributed Control application previously referenced for the format of such tables . If the name to be checked matches a local entry, the process is concluded locally stage 142, Fig. 5 . In the case of proposed name adoption, a match at this stage represents prior usage for another locally served entity, and the process concludes with posting of in use status to the program requesting the adoption which then aborts or discontinues the name use process if such use requires exclusive association with a single entity adoption process. In respect to session establishment, a local match at this stage indicates that both entities the called and calling entities are accessible locally i.e., without signal communication through the network , and the process is carried forward to conclusion locally i.e., the session is established or the process is aborted, depending on other local conditions not presently relevant . If the name being checked does not match a local table entry, the process for broadcasting a Name Check or Call Name Check signal over the directly accessible primitive network is started. The previously mentioned primitive and process timeouts are started stage 143, Fig. 5 , and the retry count is updated stage 144, Fig. 5 in this instance, set to an initial value representing the first try. The next action is conditioned on the process type stage 145, Fig. 5 . For name adoption, a Name Check message Fig. 3 is prepared, and when the network becomes available the method of access to the network medium is not relevant presently , corresponding signals are broadcast over the locally accessible medium or channel which forms the primitive network directly linked to the respective node stage 146, Fig. 5 . If the process is to establish a session, a Call Name Check message is prepared, and corresponding signals are broadcast over the local medium stage 147, Fig. 5 . After either of the foregoing operations, the local processor is released to perform other functions, but remains accessible, through interruption, for handling information arriving through the network, including acknowledgements of its Name Check or Call Name Check signals 148, Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 to be discussed later . When the primitive timeout concludes, the originating facility conditions its next action on the state of the retry count 150, Fig. 5 . The presently preferred practice is to take the retry action only if the system has received no acknowledgement of its last name checking signal. However, it would not be considered inconsistent with the present invention to conditionally retry the primitive network communications up to the retry limit even if previous communications have been acknowledged. If the retry limit has not been reached, the primitive timeout is restarted 151, Fig. 5 , and actions 144 149 are repeated via recursion path 152, 153 circled a . If the associated broadcast communication is acknowledged, the process is concluded in a manner described later with reference to Fig. 6. If the broadcast communication is unacknowledged when the retry limit is exhausted, a datagram is prepared 154, Fig. 5 and corresponding signals are sent to bridges, for extemdomg the name checking process across bridges in the respective primitive network. Specifics of datagram processing are given later in the discussion of Fig. 7. The right side of Fig. 5 indicates the operations performed at nodes within the primitive network in response to the signals broadcast at step 146 or step 147. On receiving and buffering these signals 170, Fig. 5 , the node processing facility distinguishes between name checking requests and other functions not presently relevant 171, Fig. 5 . If a name checking request has been received, the respective name is compared with entires in the local Name Table 172, Fig. 5 . If the comparison fails no matches , the communication is ignored, but if a match is found the node transmits an acknowledging signal 173, Fig. 5 . As suggested at 174, the acknowledging signal is directed specifically to the node which requested the check using the origin address 101, Fig. 3, contained in the request . The handling of Name Check and Call Name Check acknowledgements at the request origin is shown in Fig. 6. After starting the primitive and process timeouts, and sending the associated Name Check or Call Name Check request, the originating processing system is released to perform other operations 181, Fig. 6 . While performing such other operations, the processor may be interrupted 182, Fig. 6 to attend to unscheduled events, including presently relevant events such as ending of a timeout related to a communicated request or reception of a request acknowledgement. If an interruption is caused by an incoming communication, the communication type is distinguished 183, Fig. 6 . If it is an acknowledgement of a pending Name Check or Call Name Check request the acknowledgement is associated to the related software process 184, Fig 6 , via the sequence information contained in both the original request and the acknowledgement, and corresponding status information is passed to that process 185 or 186, Fig. 6 . If the related process concerns name adoption, the reported status 185 indicates existing use of the subject name at another network node identified in the acknowledgement and the adoption is discontinued see the Distributed Control reference . If the related process concerns session establishment, the reported status 186 indicates existence and location of the called entity permitting other communications for completing the session establishment function to be carried out on a point to point basis . The handling of acknowledgements relating to communications other than name checking requests is not relevant to the present discussion, and therefore is not shown in Fig. 6. The handling of plural acknowledgements of a single name checking request is explained later in the discussion of datagram handling. If the previously mentioned interruption was caused by expiration of one of the presently relevant timeouts, the action taken in the interruption process depends on the specific timeout. If the primitive timeout has concluded without an acknowledgement, and the retry limit has not been reached 149, 150 Fig. 5 , the processor restarts the primitive the timeout 151, Fig. 5 and repeats the request transmission and acknowledgement monitoring process 144 148, Fig. 5 183 186, Fig. 6 . If the primitive timeout ends and the retry limit is reached, processor initiates process 154 Fig. 5 for sending a bridge datagram containing the associated Name Check or Call Name Check request, and thereby extending the name checking process across bridges linked to the requesting processor s primitive network. This extension process is discussed below in reference to Fig. 7. If the interruption was caused by expiration of the process timeout function without acknowledgement, the processor concludes the respective process operation 190, Fig. 6 either adopting the proposed name if the original request was a Name Check or abandoning the session establishment effort if the request was a Call Name Check . The actions taken in respect to interruptions other than those discussed above are not relevant to the present invention, and therefore are not shown or discussed. The handling of bridge type datagrams at bridging and non bridging nodes is indicated in Fig. 7. Non bridging nodes originate such datagrams for one of two purposes to request initialization, or to extend a name checking process across bridges interfacing to associated primitive networks. Bridging nodes originate bridge datagrams to communicate with other bridging nodes either to extend name checking requests to networks further removed from a non bridging request originator, or to exchange other information e.g., information relating to changes in network topology . Initialization requests from non bridging nodes are instigated by respective processors at start up times presently meaning times when respective nodes are first actively coupled to the network, or re coupled after having been taken down to correct associated system failures . The information for such request, which is preset in the system s memory, is retrieved by the system 200, Fig. 7 and encapsulated in a bridge datagram 201, Fig. 7 see Fig. 4 for the datagram form . The datagram is broadcast over the associated primitive network 202, Fig. 7 . As explained previously, only processors at bridges respond to such requests and do so by returning acknowledging signals containing delay factor information. The formation of such responses is discussed later under setting of node timeouts . As noted previously, the longest delay factor is selected by the request originator as its process timeout function. Bridge datagrams to extend name checking from non bridging to bridging nodes are formed in the manner illustrated at 204 206 Fig. 7 . When the processor at a node originating a name checking request detects the limit of its primitive retry action, without having received an acknowledgement of its associated communications operations 204 , it retrieves the related information 205 and forms the datagram 206 . Corresponding signals are placed on the directly accessible communication medium operation 207 to communicate the information to bridges linked to that medium. The bridges extend the respective name checking communication by actions discussed later. A bridge receiving one or more acknowledgements of its extended communications passes the first such back to the originating processor through the network. Each bridge monitors its media on both sides including the medium directly linked to the datagram origin , and the bridges thereby cooperate to ensure that no more than a single acknowledgement of such a datagram returns to the originating node from all of the bridges primitively linked to that node . The processing facility which originated the datagram is eventually interrupted 208 by a condition related to that communication either a returning acknowledgement 209 or a local process timeout condition 210 . When this occurs, the associated name checking process is concluded. If that process was for unique name adoption, and the datagram was acknowledged, in use status is posted to the associated process program. If the process was for session establishment, and was acknowledged, information indicating a good response and identifying the first acknowledging node is posted to the associated program. If the process timeout expired without acknowledgement, and the process related to name adoption, good status is posted to the associated program which causes the name to be adopted entered into the local name table in association with the respective local entity . If the timeout expired for a datagram containing a Call Name Check, unsuccessful status is posted indicating to the associated program that the name of the entity sought to be contacted is not recognizable within the network. When a bridging node receives a datagram 220, Fig. 7 , its processor inspects the type field 221 to distinguish between datagrams directed to bridges and other datagrams refer to the referenced Non Unique application for descriptions of other datagram forms and their usage . Datagrams not directed to bridges are not relevant to the present discussion. On recognizing a bridge type datagram, the respective bridge processor inspects the datagram origin 222, Fig. 7 , since different handling is required for bridge datagrams received from bridging nodes and non bridging nodes. If the datagram source is a non bridging node, the form of the datagram infor mation is inspected 223, Fig. 7 to distinguish between requests for initialization and datagrams requesting extension of name checking operations. If such a datagram contains a request for initialization, the bridge processor consults its table see discussion of Fig. 8 below , and returns a related delay factor to the request origin 224, Fig. 7 . If a datagram originated by a non bridging node contains a name checking request, the bridge processor extracts a hop count factor from its associated table 225, Fig. 7 , and initiates the process for extending that request to network paths spanned by the respective bridge. The extracted hop count is a value designed to extend the range of the name checking request through networks spanned by other bridges, and out to a medium furthest removed from the original requesting node, but restricted so that the request can not circulate through another bridge forming a looping path back to the originating node. A bridge receiving a name checking datagram from a preceding bridge initiates the same extension process, but with a hop count value contained in the received datagram 226, Fig. 7 . The process performed by a bridge for extending a name checking request to a respectively spanned medium 226 241, Fig. 7 includes decrementing the hop count 226 , either the count set at 225 or the count contained in a datagram received from a preceding bridge starting primitive and process timeouts related to the path beyond the bridge 227 broadcasting the name checking message contained in the received datagram over the spanned medium 228 and incrementing a retry count 229 . The primitive timeout set at 227 is a function of the longest handling and response delays anticipated relative to the primitive path beyond the bridge, and the process timeout is a function of the longest delays anticipated over the full hop count range of the path beyond the bridge including successive bridges and media . The extension process yields either one or more acknowledgements 230 233 or actions evoked by timeout interruptions 234 241 . If an acknowledgement is received 230 an acknowledgement count is incremented 231 . The first received acknowledgement is passed back, along the path from which the related datagram was received 232 , either to a preceding bridge or the node which originated the request whichever is directly accessible from the node handling the acknowledgement . If more than one acknowledgement is received during one timeout period, a conflict signal is transmitted 233 towards the sources of acknowledgement. The foregoing statement applies only to acknowledgements received from the side of the bridge which is remote from the source of the respective datagram. However, in the primitive network serving a non bridging node which originates a name check datagram, each bridge should be adapted to recognize an acknowledgement of the datagram transferred from another bridge to the medium which links directly to the originating node, and increment its acknowledgement count in response to that acknowledgement. This would lessen signal traffic in the primitive network, since only the first acknowledgement of a datagram would be relayed through bridges, even if acknowledgements are received at plural bridges. Furthermore, it would simplify the handling of signal transmissions indicating conflicting name usage since each bridge would be responsible for sending such signals to the respective path extending beyond the primitive network, and would do so even if it received only one acknowledgement from the respective path when another bridge transferred an earlier acknowledge ment to the primitive path. If the primitive timeout ends without acknowledgement 234, Fig. 7 and the retry limit has not been exhausted, the primi tive timeout is restarted 235, Fig. 7 and operations 228 and 229 are repeated. If the retry count reaches the limit recognized at 236, Fig. 7 the action taken next is conditioned 237 on the value of the hop count as decremented at 226. If the value is other than 0, the bridge forms a datagram containing the decremented hop count but corresponding otherwise to the datagram received at 220 , and transmits that datagram to the path directed away from the request originator action 238, Fig. 7 . That transmission is followed either by receipt of acknowledgement 230 or expiration of the respective process timeout 240 . If the process timeout expires, or the hop count value inspected at stage 237 is 0, the handling of the datagram communication process at the respective bridge is concluded 241 . At such conclusion no acknowledgements after full term handling , the bridge takes no further action relative to the network. Each bridge maintains a table having the form suggested in Fig. 8, for responding to requests for initialization from non bridging nodes see 223, 224, Fig. 7 . The table reflects the topology of the network on both sides of the respective bridge sides 1 and 2 . The entires in the table rows are established when the bridge is first introduced into the network e.g., through information keyed into the bridge processing facility by a technician responsible for setting up the bridge attachment . The table columns indicate the parameters associated with the nodes directly linked to each side of the respective bridge. There is at least one column of entries for each node address addresses Ai and Aj are illustrated as representative , and columns may be provided for bridging nodes type B as well as non bridging nodes type NB . As indicated in the footnotes to Fig. 8, there may be more than one column of entries for a node having plural co active requests. The columns associated with bridging nodes can be used to enable the respective bridge to ascertain the hop count topology extending beyond another bridge primitively linked to the respective bridge. The delay factor for bridging type nodes is X don t care . The delay factor for non bridging nodes is a constant D1 for nodes accessed through side 1 and D2 for nodes accessed through side 2. The value of the constant is a function of the network topology extending beyond the opposite side of the bridge. Thus, D1 is a function of the topology viewed at side 2 and D2 is a function of the topology viewed at side 1. The timer values are the values used at the respective bridge for setting its datagram handling timeouts relative to the nodes designated in each column. The hop count values are the values used for initializing hop count functions relative to name checking datagrams received from associated non bridging nodes see 225, Fig. 7 . The sequence number and frame identity ID terms are set in accordance with information in name checking datagrams currently being processed, and permit the bridge to associate acknowledgements with respective request origins. The state information distinguishes between initiated and uninitiated node states, allowing the bridge to reject name checking datagram requests erroneously issued by uninitiated nodes. We have described above a method for extending name checking communications, which are originated independently by peer processors across bridging interfaces between primitive portions of a complex network. Such extensions are handled without ambiguity, and with minimal burdening of the originating processors, by processors located at the bridging interfaces. This tends to lessen the traffic burden on the network since acknowledgements of an extended name checking communication, other than the first acknowledgement, are trapped at the first bridge sensing such acknowledgements , as well as the processing burdens imposed on the non bridging processors. The foregoing techniques can be modified in several ways without departing from what we presently consider to be our invention. For example, the function achieved by setting the hop count at the first bridge in the extension path of a name checking request could also be realized by requiring each bridge to compare identities of newly received name checking datagrams with identities of datagrams currently being timed out. Thus, if an extension process transferred across several bridges enters a bridge completing a looping path, the latter bridge would detect conflict with a datagram transferred earlier in the opposite direction, and supress ignore the newly received datagram. Furthermore, the extended communication effect achieved by means of bridge datagrams could be realized less efficiently, but possibly more reliably by means of point to point communications. Instead of sending a datagram, a node originating a name checking process could establish individual sessions with each bridge linked to its primitive network, and transfer the information to be handled across each bridge in a session communication see the referenced Distributed Control application for the form of such communications . Each bridge could do the same for communicating with the next further level of bridges relative to a name checking process. Furthermore, the timeout initialization process could also be conducted by means of separate session communications between a non bridging node and each primitively coupled bridging node. Accordingly, while the invention has been described with reference to a particular embodiment, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various modifications in form and detail may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
