# METHOD OF ROLLING METAL SLAB

## Abstract
In a method of hot rolling a metal slab in order to in crease its width, a pair of opposite faces of the slab are hot rolled to produce a groove in each of the faces but the lateral edges of the faces are not rolled and, thereafter, the slab is passed between a pair of cylindrical rolls in order to reduce the slab to uniform thickness. Preferably, an additional step is included in which the initially formed grooves are widened by additional rolling before the thickness of the slab is re duced to a uniform value.
