# METHOD OF MODIFYING A CLOSURE MEMBER EQUIPPED WITH A LATCH OR A KEY OPERATED LOCK AND UNIT FOR USE IN THE METHOD

## Abstract
A lock 11 fitted to a door 10 is modified by inserting an appropriate key into the lock so that a handle 12 of the key protrudes from the lock and applying a control unit 14 to the door to cover and engage drivingly the handle of the key. The control unit is responsive to a magnetically coded key, by means of which the control unit can be set in a condition in which torque is transmitted from a knob 18 to the key.
