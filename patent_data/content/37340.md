# Low energy curable coating compositions comprising an epoxide, a polyisocyanate, a polycarboxylic acid and a stannous salt catalyst.

## Abstract
The present invention deals with low energy curable coating compositions comprising an epoxide, a polyisocyan ate, a polycarboxylic acid and a stannous salt catalyst. These compositions comprise 5 to 60 weight percent of an epoxide, an organic polyisocyanate, to 60 weight percent of a liquid polycarboxylic acid produced by the reaction of a polycaprolactone polyol and an intramolecular polycarboxylic acid anhydride, and 0.1 to 10 weight percent of a stannous mono or dicarboxylate in C₁ to C₅₄ or a stannous alkoxide in C₁ to C₁₈, so as to have an epoxide isocyanato equivalent ratio of from 0.2 to 1.5. The compositions in question cure to hard dry films at very low temperature and cure times.
