# Apparatus and process for pulsed flow, balanced double jet precipitation.

## Abstract
A pulsed flow, balanced double jet precipitation appar atus and process are disclosed in which a silver salt solution and a halide salt solution are mixed in a primary mixing zone defined within a reaction vessel having a gelatin solution therein and in which pulses of a predetermined volume of the silver salt solution and the halide salt solution are alternately introduced at substantially the same point in the primary mixing zone with a predetermined pause between each pulse.
