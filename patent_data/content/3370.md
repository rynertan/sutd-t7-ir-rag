# Method for the continuous manufacture of a powder filled welded tube.

## Abstract
Powder filled welded tube is made by forming metal strip into a channel 40 , feeding powder into the channel, closing the channel into a tube and welding the closed edges 41 and 42 to form a sealed tube. In order to prevent the powder being affected by the heat of the welding, the amount of powder introduced is such that it only partially fills the closed tube at the welding stage. A subsequent size reduction of the tube causes the powder to become firmly packed, to prevent its movement along the tube.

## Description
Method and apparatus for the continuous manufacture of powder filled welded tube The invention relates to a method for the continuous manufacture of powder filled welded tube, including the steps of forming a metal strip into an open channel, introducing filling powder into the channel, closing the channel edges together to form a continuous tube with a closed longitudinal joint, welding said closed longitudinal joint to form a sealed tube, and reducing the size of the sealed tube.The invention also relates to the tube produced by the method. Filled tube, and filled wire which can be formed from such tube, serve several purposes, for instance in welding processes as filler material or buildup material in oint welding or build up welding respectively. This applies in semi and fully automatic welding processes, wherein the metal of the tube or wire itself together with any metals in the filling provides the metal deposit, and slag forming compounds in the filling have a protective and or refining function.The filled tube or wire can in its final cross section be for example circular, oval or rectangular with rounded off corners. Typical dimensions are known in the welding art. A great number of publications, including many in the patent literature, have been issued about the use, manufacture and outward appearance of filled wire and the compositions of its filling. See the article y ulldr√§hte im Spiegel der Patentliterature by Dipl. Ing.Werner John, ZIS Mitteilungen, Heft 3 1959 , pages 915 through 924. The conventional method of manufacturing filled tube is a continuous process in which metal strip is continuously formed into a U shaped channel, the filling material is inserted into the channel, and the channel is closed into a tube. In some cases the edges of the channel have been deformed to lock them together.It is also known to weld the channel eages together continuously, to form a sealed tube. When welding the channel edges, there is the danger that the heat generated by the welding will deleteriously affect the filling material, altering its composition or otherwise rendering it unsuitable for its purpose. Another problem, at least where the filler is a powder and electric welding is used, is that the powder tends to be whirled about by the magnetic fields present and to settle on the contact surfaces of the channel edges, possibly causing the weld to be weak. The prior art proposals have not solved these problems satisfactorily and economically. U. . patent specification 1,057,852 a ii ation Netherlands paten 98,923 describes the use of a wet paste, including binder, as the filler material. This avoids the problem that the material will be whirled around. However apart from the extra step of forming the paste, the water in the paste is usually not wanted in use of the filled tube, and it is difficult or impossible to remove the water from the sealed tube. This specification suggests that the tube is baked after welding to improve the hygroscopic tendency page , line 45 .The problem of damage to the filling during welding of the channel edges is not avoided. 9 U.K. patent specification 1,485,5 1 Netherlands application 75.05156 French specification 2,271,898 describes a process in which, after the channel has been filled with loose powder, a covering ribbon or foil, e.g. a band of soft steel of a thickness of 0.3 mm, is placed on the powder. The ribbon has a groove in it. The channel is then drawn through a die which closes its edges together and causes compaction of the powder beneath the covering foil. This occurs before welding. The purpose of the ribbon is to prevent the powder from adhering to the edges of the channel when the channel is closed together.This product is unsatisfactory firstly because of the additional expense of providing the ribbon, secondly because the ribbon being of conductive metal, does not satisfactorily protect the filling powder from the heat generated when the tube is welded, and thirdly because in use of the tube in electric arc welding, the folded tape will cause asymmetric current density and consequently a different melting characteristic from that of a cylindrical welding wire. In other words, as a result of the asymmetric current density the arc will not be stable but will swing, leading to unsatisfactory welding. The object of the present invention is therefore to provide a process for making powder filled welded tube, in which the disadvantages of the prior art are avoided, which is simple and economic and in which in particular the powder filling is not deleteriously affected by the welding of the tube, while the tube has a uniform cross section. The invention as claimed provides a solution to this problem. In essence, the powder filling occupies only a part of the tube when the welding occurs, so that the heat caused by welding does not reach the powder excessively. During welding the powder is still loose, and only after welding does it come to fill the tube entirely, as a result of the subsequent size reduction which drives out the remaining air and packs the powder firmly in order to prevent longitudinal movement of the powder. There is no extra element, e.g. a ribbon or foil, so that the product has a uniform cross section. U.K. specification 1,485,571 mentions the solution of reducing the amount of powder which is fed into the channel , but states that this is very disadvantageous. It is not apparent that what is intended is that the tube is only partially filled at the welding stage. Preferably, in the practice of this invention, in the size reduction step the tube size is reduced to such an extent that the filling powder is compressed into a compact mass, i.e. the size reduction is more than is necessary to achieve firm packing of the powder in the tube. The size reduction to pack the powder core firmly serves to prevent the powder from being dislodged longitudinally of the tube. The optional further reduction causes additional compression of the powder in the tube so as to form a compact mass. Conventional tube welding methods have the drawback that during welding of the strip edges there is a considerable risk of the occurrence of welding spatters as a result of sparks Jumping. These spatters have a harmful effect on the composition of the filler materials, one of the purposes of which is slag formation during later use. The invention provides that this disadvantage of welding spatters and additionally the disadvantage of powder adhering to the channel edges are minimized by pressing together the strip edges, e.g. by means of butt rollers, substantially before the welding. Thus preferably according to the invention the welding of the tlbe to seal it is preferably done at the longitudinal joint which has been closed before hand and which is kept under such pressure during welding that the strip edges remain in contact. In this way it is prevented that by resilience of the material the butt weld formed is subjected to inadmissible tensile loads. A second advantage of preliminary closure of the strip edges is that fine particles from the filler powder are prevented from being whirled about by the magnetic fields present during electrical welding, and from settling on the contact surfaces of the strip edges and thus possibly causing a weak weld. Besides, at least in terms of metallurgy, the largest possible metallic contact occurs if the strip edges are pressed together. To achieve satisfactory results, preferably at the time of welding, the powder occupies not more than 85 of the internal cross sectional area of the tube, e.g. 70 c less of the internal cross sectional area. The invention also provides the product of the above described method. This may be a coiled welded powder filled tube or may be lengths of the tube, the ends of each length being closed. Embodiments of the invention will be described below by way of non limitative exavnle with reference to the accompanying drawings, ir whl n Fig. 1 is a block. sequence diagram ol the various steps of a typical process embodying the invention Figs. 2a and 2b show details of the filling and welding steps in one process embodying the invention and Figs. 3a and 3b show details of the filling and welding steps in another method embodying the invention. Referring to Fig. 1, a flat strip of steel is uncoiled from a coil in an uncoiling station 1.In a strip welding station 2, the beginning of each new coil is wided to the end of the strip of the previous coil so that with the use of a strip accumulator, an endless strip feed is produced. After this welding, the strip passes through a cleaning device for removal of any kind of dirt such as water, grease, moisture etc.from it. Cleaning the strip is easier to perform than mechanically cleaning and degreasing the inside of a finished jointless tube. In a forming station 3, the strip is deformed into an open channel by successive sets of rolls. At a filling station 4, by means of feed equipment of sufficient accuracy, for instance an electronically controlled weighing system combined with a vibrating trough and a worm conveyor, a powder filler material either a fine powder or a powdery particulate material is fed into the channel, to fill the channel up to a predetermined level. This powder is to serve as a flux or as a slag formation and or alloying agent in electrical arc welding. The combination of vibration with a worm conveyor provides a constant flow rate of the material, and thus accurate dosing. Other suitable feeding methods may alternatively be employed. In the welding station 5, the edges of the channel are pressed together to form a continuous tube with a longitudinal joint, which is welded along this joint so that a sealed welded tube is produced. Before and during welding it is important that the channel is pressed into a continuous tube with a longitudinal joint, by pressing the strip edges against one another.In this way the occurrence, of welding spatters during welding is prevented. Nor can magnetisable particles from the powder, which may whirl up due to the magnetic fields produced when welding electrically, be deposited on the contact surfaces of the strip edges, so that the welding area should remain clean and a proper weld be produced. The metallic contact area between the strip edges pressed together is as large as possible. The level in the channel to which the powder is filled by the filling station a is carefully chosen and controlled so that, when the tube is at the welding station 5, it is not fully filled, i.e. the powder occupies only a part of the internal cross section of the tube. For instance, if the internal diameter of the tube is d, the depth of the layer of powder at the welding station is suitably about 0.75 d or slightly less, e.g. the powder occupies about 70 of the internal cross sectional area of the tube. This results in the advantages explained above. Before welding, it may be preferable to carry out a calibration sizing so that the strip edges are positioned in relation to each other very accurately. Aphis calibration can be achieved by a slight reduction of the diameter. A further possibility is to clean the strip edges immediately before the tube is closed. Before continuing the description of the process of Fig. 1, a few possibilities for welding and filling will now be discussed with reference toFigs. 2 and 3. Fig. 2a shows in perspective a tube 40 being welded by high frequency conductive welding. Fig. 2b which is a cross section on the line C C in Fig. 4a, shows the method of filling. The edges 41 and 42 of the tube 40 are pressed together by a first set of press rollers 43,43. Between the press rollers 43,43 and a second set of press rollers also pressing the tube edges together, two sets of slide shoes 47 and 48 or other suitable sliding contacts are provided with in each case one shoe on either side of the still just open gap between the edges 41,42. During welding the shces 47 and 48 are connected to a hf source not shown , so that the highfrequency current flows along the strip edges 41,42 lengthwise of the tube 40.Owing to the skin effect, this1high frequency current will at least below the socalled curie point of the steel being welded tend to move in the edges of the joint, causing heating of the material around this gap so that a narrow V shaped area reaches the temperature required for welding. This has the advantage that only a very slight welding bead occurs on the tube interior. The actual welding point 4S is situated between the press rollers 44,44 and the welded joint produced is denoted by 46. Fig. 2b shows that introduction of the powder 45a is carried out by a vertical pipe 4E which is thrust between the edges 41 and 42 before they are pressed together. With two sets of press rollers 43,44 at which the joint is pressed together, the risk of magnetizable particles from the powder landing between the strip edges is negligible. Fig. 2b shows also how the powder only partially fills the tube during the welding step, leaving an air gap above between itself and the point of welding. The amount of heating is not sufficient to cause excessive heating of the powder. Figs. 3a and 3b, like Figs. 2a and 2b show two sets of press rollers 53,54. In this case resistance welding is effected by means of roller electrodes 55.Fig. 3a shows in perspective the welding station with a length of tube 50, whose edges 51 and 52 are pressed together by the first set of press rollers 53,53. A second set of press rollers 54,54 is longitudinally spaced from the first set by a short distance. A pair of rotating roller electrodes 55 connected to an energy source is situated between the sets of press rollers r3 and 54 and effects resistance welding at the welding point56 to form a welded joint 57. Fig. 3b which is a cross section on the line D D of Fig. 3a shows that the powder 58a is introduced through a vertical filling pipe 58, which is inserted between the strip edges 51 and 52 into the tube 50, at a rate such that the powder only partially fills the tube at the welding point. In the embodiments of Figs. 2 and 3, the tube is fully closed, and the longitudinal gap is reduced to zero before the welding point. The tube is kept under pressure for a short period after welding, so that retraction is avoided. This has the beneficial result that in the still hot welding zone tensions and deformations transverse to the longitudinal direction of the tube are not inrtroduced. Returning to Fig. 1, a calibrating or sizing station 6 follows after the welding station 5.Before the sealed tube is subjected to calibration, external welding bead formed in the welding can be removed by planing. Immediately after planing the tube can be cooled. Calibration is done using calibrating rollers, and causes such a reduction in the diameter of the tube that the air above the powder is driven out and powder core is firmly enclosed in the tube. This prevents the powder moving along the tube. In the station 7 a draw treatment of the tube follows with the aid of drawing blocks, which causes a further reduction in diameter and at the same time compresses the powder in the tube to a more compact mass.In the next station 8 the tube is degreased. The material obtained may be a precursor material which still has to undergo further reductions down to the dimensions required by the customer.Products which can be manufactured from the partially completed material include filled welding wire, filled welding strip and sealed heating elements. Because the metal hardens as a result of the cold deformation during reduction, it may be thought necessary to anneal the product in an annealing furnace c , and this must be done without causing undesirable changes in the powder. However, for some purposes the work hardening caused by the size reduction is advantageous. The product is next copper plated in the station 10, if a better outward appearance is required. In the station 11, drawing blocks or a roll reduction machine are provided to reduce the product even further and to give it the dimensions Pnd shape required for itC final use. In a finishing station 12, the finished product is either coiled on a coiler into a bundle suitable for despatch, or is cut to the required lengths with the cut ends being made so that the filling cannot drop out. The illustrated method of the invention is fully reproducible and provides a uniform product, in which the complete sealing safeguards the powder from being affected by air, moisture, grease etc. This method also places no restrictions on the composition of the powder or the type of powder, in contrast with many other methods where the powder must be pre treated in some or other way, for instance by intering and grinding.
