## Description
This invention relates to apparatus for cleaning teeth, and more particularly to an improved dental cleaning system for removal of tenacious stain and heavy plaque from exposed tooth surfaces by simultaneously directing a stream of air containing entrained cleaning powder and a stream of water onto the surface to be cleaned. While an effective home care program including regular brushing and flossing is considered essential to dental hygiene, such home care normally cannot be completely effective in removing stain and plaque particularly from relatively inaccessible surfaces between the teeth and from pits and fissures. Accordingly, it is normally recommended that a dental care program include periodic professional cleaning. Such professional cleaning conventionally has involved the removal of calculus, particularly from subgingival surfaces, and the cleaning of exposed enamel surfaces for the removal of stain and plaque by polishing the enamel surfaces with a rubber cap and an abrasive material, typically pumice, in a paste. This method is effective in cleaning accessible surfaces, but cannot remove all stains from deep pits and fissures. It has also been known, for example, from U.S. Patent No. 3,882,638 and 3,972,123, to employ air abrasive equipment for cleaning teeth, using insoluble abrasive particles entrained in an air stream directed onto the tooth surface while simultaneously discharging a water stream onto the surface. Soluble abrasive cleaning particles or pellets, and powdered abrasive cleaning material, respectively, are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,214,871 and 4,174,571. EPA 0097288, which was published after the priority date of the present application, discloses apparatus for cleaning teeth by directing a flow of air and entrained powder particles against the tooth surface to be cleaned, wherein a fluid tight chamber for entraining cleaning powder into an air flow comprises an air inlet and an outlet at a point above the level of cleaning powder in the chamber. US A 3882 638, in particular, discloses an apparatus for cleaning teeth by directing a stream of air and entrained cleaning powder particles and a stream of water against the tooth surface to be cleaned from a nozzle assembly in a handpiece. The apparatus comprises a fluid tight chamber for containing a supply of cleaning powder from which the powder is discharged in an air stream from an opening in the chamber above the cleaning powder supply, first air conduit means for supplying air under pressure to the handpiece, second air conduit means connected to said first air conduit for directing a stream of air under pressure from the first air conduit means into the bottom portion of the fluid tight chamber for entraining cleaning powder into the stream to be discharged through the outlet opening in the fluid tight chamber, and third air conduit means connecting the outlet from said fluid tight chamber to said first air conduit means, downstream of said second air conduit means whereby, in use, air and cleaning powder discharged from the outlet of the fluid tight chamber will be mixed with the air flowing through said first air conduit means directly to the handpiece for delivery in a stream onto the tooth surface to be cleaned. A valve means is operable to interrupt the flow of air and cleaning powder to the handpiece, the first and second one way valve means, connected respectively in said first and in said second air conduit means, are operable to prevent a reverse flow of air. DE A 1948 356 discloses a dental cleaning apparatus for directing a stream of air having cleaning powder particles entrained therein against a tooth surface to be cleaned and including a conduit system for supplying air under pressure to a manually controlled handpiece to convey and discharge the cleaning powder, and an air filter which comprises The prior art abrasive cleaning devices which have been most widely used commercially employ water delivered in one or more streams adjacent to or surrounding the air abrasive stream to provide a wet surface for more effective cleaning, to eliminate dust from within the patient s mouth, and to dissolve and flush abrasive material from the tooth surface for removal by conventional suction equipment. Although insoluble abrasives have met with only limited acceptance, soluble abrasive material is widely used for professional cleaning of teeth. In particular, sodium bicarbonate abrasive cleaning powder hereinafter cleaning powder has been widely accepted and is very effective in removing stain and plaque even from deep pits and fissures. Difficulty has been encountered in reliably delivering both soluble and insoluble cleaning abrasive materials at a uniform, accurately controllable rate. Dispensing and conveying solid cleaning materials through complex conduit and valving systems by pressurized air has presented difficulty, particularly since it has generally been necessary to vary air pressure and or flow rate in order to control and vary the amount of abrasive cleaning material delivered to the handpiece. Filters used in the air system generally have been of the disposable type which could not be serviced or cleaned and which if not changed at proper intervals, could result in further difficulty in controlling flow rates and pressures. Similarly, pinch valves used to stop flow through flexible tubing of the system have not always been reliable and have presented substantial difficulty in operation. The prior art systems of this general type generally have included a separate, valve controlled bleed off system for depressurizing the cleaning powder supply and dispensing apparatus and the pressurized powder dispensing conduit upon shut down of the system. Such bleed off systems required separate filter mechanism for removing and collecting cleaning powder bled from the system to prevent it from being discharged into the open atmosphere. Such filtered bleed off systems also presented additional service requirements. and sudden bleed off of air from the pressurized supply container could result in substantial volumes of cleaning material being carried away and wasted. It is the primary object of the present invention to provide an improved air abrasive dental cleaning system of the type employing a soluble cleaning powder entrained in and delivered by a stream of air onto the surface to be cleaned while simulataneously discharging a stream of water onto the surface to be cleaned. Another object is to provide such system which includes an improved more reliable system for supplying cleaning powder to the air abrasive outlet in the handpiece of the cleaning apparatus. Another object is to provide such an improved system which is more reliable in operation and which can be easily and quickly serviced by relatively unskilled personnel to maintain a reliable, accurately controlled rate of dispensing cleaning powder. Another object is to provide an improved, easily serviceable, extended use filter for use in such a cleaning powder supply system. Another object of the invention is to provide an improved cleaning powder supply system having an improved flow control valve for controlling the flow of cleaning powder and air through the system. According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided an apparatus for cleaning teeth by directing a stream of air and entrained cleaning powder particles and a stream of water from a nozzle assembly in a hand piece, the apparatus comprising a fluid tight chamber for containing a supply of cleaning powder from which the powder is discharged in an air stream from an opening in the chamber above the cleaning powder supply, The apparatus of this aspect of the invention is thereby provided with an efficient pressurized air delivery and control system for maintaining a highly uniform flow of air for dispensing and conveying cleaning powder from a supply thereof, including an improved valve and filter system which effectively maintains the flow of cleaning powder to the handpiece used in cleaning the teeth while effectively preventing the escape of cleaning powder into any portion of the system other than the line leading from the cleaning powder supply to the handpiece outlet nozzle. Another aspect of the invention provides a dental cleaning apparatus for directing a stream of air having cleaning powder particles entrained therein against the tooth surface to be cleaned and including a conduit system for supplying air under pressure to a manually controlled handpiece to convey and discharge the cleaning powder, and an air filter, which air filter comprises Thus, in this aspect of the invention improved filters which may readily and easily be manually disassembled and cleaned, and which incorporate means for preventing reverse flow through the filter element are included in the fluid flow path of the system, and an improved bleed off filter mounted within the cleaning powder supply chamber is connected in a bleed line containing flow restriction means for bleeding pressure from the supply chamber upon shut down of the system without permitting the escape of cleaning powder into the bleed system. Preferably the first and second one way filters each comprise a fluid tight hollow housing having an inlet and an outlet and a fluid flow path extending through the housing from the inlet to the outlet and a sintered metal filter element removably mounted within the housing in said fluid flow path. The housing generally comprises first and second generally cup shaped housing members each having one open end. said inlet and outlet, respectively, being formed one in the end of each said housing member opposite said open end, and cooperating thread means adjacent the open ends of each said housing member for releasably joining the housing members together to form a fluid tight housing having said inlet and outlet in opposite ends thereof. The system may additionally further comprise cooperating thread means on said sintered metal filter element and on one of said housing members for releasably mounting said sintered metal filter element in said housing. For example the sintered metal filter element mounted in said housing may comprise an elongated substantially tubular sintered metal element having an integral wall closing one end, said thread means on the filter element being male threads formed on the end opposite said end wall. Other features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the detailed description contained hereinbeiow, taken in conjunction with the drawings, in which Referring now to the drawings in detail and especially Figure 1, a handpiece used in directing an air abrasive stream and surrounding water spray curtain onto the surface of teeth to be cleaned is designated generally by the reference numeral 10 and includes an elongated handle portion 12 and a nozzle head 14 supported on a rigid water supply tube 16. A flexible water supply conduit 18 extends into the handle 12 and is connected to the rigid tube 16 within the handpiece for supplying water under pressure to the head 14. A second flexible supply conduit 20 also extends into the handle 12 and is connected to a removable, flexible tube 22 for supplying air under pressure and entrained cleaning powder to the cleaning head 14. Air is supplied to the apparatus through an air supply line 24 from a suitable compressed air source such as a conventional dental office air supply compressor, not shown, and water is supplied through a separate line 26 from a suitable source such as a municipal water supply line. A water pressure regulator 28 is connected in line 26 to adjust the water pressure at a constant desired level, and a suitable heater 30 connected in the water supply line maintains the water to the handpiece at a desired temperature which will be comfortable to a patient. Flow of warm water to the handpiece is controlled by a solenoid actuated valve 32 connected, through line 34. to a three position foot actuated control switch 36. The water supply system and the structure of the handpiece, per se, may be of conventional construction and as such form no part of the present invention other than being necessary to the overall operation of the dental cleaning system. Referring still to Figure 1, air under pressure flowing through line 24 passes initially through an inlet, or preliminary filter 38 which removes water, contaminates, dust particles and the like, then through a main solenoid actuated shut off valve 40 and pressure reducer regulator 42 which maintains the air pressure to the apparatus at a constant, desired level. A suitable gauge 44 may be provided downstream of regulator 42 to provide a continuous visible display of system air pressure. Valve 40 is vented to atmosphere to bleed pressure from the system, through line 46, when the valve is closed. From pressure regulator valve 42, air flows through line 46 and a suitable variable flow restrictor, preferably a manually operated needle valve 50. An improved air filter and one way check valve 52 is also connected in line 46 to further filter the air flowing to the handpiece 10 ano to prevent reverse flow through the filter. Air flows through air filter and one way check valve 50 to a Y fitting 48 connected to the flexible air conduit 20 to supply air to the handpiece 10. Air also flows from line 46 through line 54 to the coupling member 56 mounted on the bottom of a powder chamber assembly designated generally as 58. A second combined air filter and check valve 60 is connected in line 54. From chamber 58 air flows through a line 62 to 20 the Y fitting 48 to deliver entrained cleaning powder particles to the flexible conduit 20 to flow with air from line 46 through handpiece 10 and flexible tube 22 to be discharged from the cleaning head 14. Flow of air and cleaning powder particles through line 62 is controlled by 25 a normally closed air energised diaphragm actuated pinch valve 64. Actuating air is supplied to valve 64 through a line 66 connected to line 46, and a one way check valve 68 connected in line 66 prevents reverse flow through this line. Flow through line 66 to valve 64 is controlled by a three way normally open, energised closed solenoid valve 70 connected, through line 72 to the foot actuated Control switch 36. When valve 70 is energised, pinch valve 64 is vented to atmosphere to permit the pinch valve to flow through line 62. When pinch valve 64 is energised to close line 62, cleaning powder chamber 58 will normally remain pressurised through line 54 and through a second conduit 74 connected between line 46 and an inlet in the top portion of chamber 58. As indicated schematically in Figure 1, and described more fully nereinbelow, a flow restrictor 76 connected in line 74 limits the rate of flow through this line and an air filter 78 connected in the line serves both to filter air flowing into chamber 58 and to prevent cleaning powder particles from escaping into the system when the system is vented to atmosphere by closing main flow control valve 40. With valve 40 closed and the system vented to atmosphere through this valve. chamber 58 can be opened for cleaning and servicing or for refilling with cleaning powder as seen as gauge 44 indicates system pressure has reached zero. With valve 40 open normal bleed air flows through line 46 and tube 20 to be discharged from handpiece 10. With valve 40 open and control switch 36 actuated to its first detent position, water flow control valve is energised open to permit flow of irrigation or rinsing water through handpiece 10. When the foot actuated control 36 is moved to its second detent or fully depressed position, water control valve 32 will remain open, and valve 70 will be energised to depressurise and release pinch valve 64 to permit a flow particulate cleaning powder and air from chamber 58 through line 62 to handpiece 10. An improved cleaning powder supply chamber and dispensing mechanism 58 suitable for use in combination with the present invention is illustrated in Figure 2. Except for the flow restrictor 76 and filter 78 in line 74, the structure illustrated in Figure 2 is not a part of the present invention, but is the subject of our European patent application No. 84 300 953.1 publication No. 0 119 736 filled concurrently herewith. The supply chamber 58 includes a cleaning powder hopper, or bowl 80 for containing a supply of cleaning powder indicated generally at 82. Powder bowl 80 is formed from a high strength transparent material to permit viewing of the contents, and has its open top threaded into and supported by a rigid support housing 84. A resilient O ring provides a fluid tight seal between the housing and bowl. The bottom wall portions 86 of bowl 80 is tapered inwardly at an angle which will assure gravity feed of the powder mass 82 toward a central opening 88 in the bottom of the bowl. An air nozzle structure 90 is mounted on the bottom of the bowl and is connected by coupling tube 56 to line 54 to direct air under pressure upward through an elongated powder supply tube 92. Supply tube 92 extends axially through bowl 80 and has its open bottom end in fluid communication with the opening 88. A plurality of radially spaced powder dispensing openings 94 are formed in and extend through the wall of tube 92 at its bottom end to permit a limited, metered flow of cleaning powder into one bottom portion of the tube. Air flowing into tube 92 below openings 94 entrains the cleaning powder and carries it upward through the centre of the bowl to be discharged from the top end of the tube. Air turbulence in the vicinity of the openings 94 produces an erosion effect on the body of powder to assist in gravity dispensing of powder through the openings to maintain a substantially uniform concentration of cleaning powder in the stream of air discharged from the top of tube 92. Air and entrained cleaning powder discharged from tube 92 escape from the top region of the powder chamber 58 through a radially extending outlet 96 in housing 84. Tube 62 is connected in communication with the outlet 96 to deliver the air abrasive stream to the handpiece at described above. The air and entrained cleaning powder are discharggd from the top of tube 82 in a stream which strikes an inclined surface 98 on a movable baffle member 100 which redirects the powder particles in a generally horizontal direction toward outlet 96. Baffle member 100 is rotatably mounted in a central opening of a cap or closure member 102 on the open top or housing 84. A retaining flange 104 having a position indicator or pointer 106 is mounted on the upwardly project ing end of flow control member 100. Flange 104 can be rotated to change the position of surface 88 and vary the concentration of cleaning powder contained in air discharged from outlet 96 as described in the above mentioned concurrently filed application. Air admitted into the top portion of the chamber from line 74 through restrictor 76 and filter 78 mixes with the powder laden air in the top portion of the powder dispenser and escapes through outlet 96. Thus, the volume of air flowing in tube 62 is greater than that admitted through tube 54 into the bottom of the powder chamber. Referring now to Figure 3, the improved serviceable air filter and check valve assembly of the type employed at 60 and 62 in the schematic view of Figure 1 is designated generally by the reference numeral 110 and includes a hollow housing made up of housing members 112, 114 and a resilient O ring 116 cooperates with and forms a fluid tight seal between the two housing elements. Housing member 112 has a cylindrical body portion 118 defining an air chamber 120. A reduced diameter inlet 122 on housing member 112 is adapted to telescopingly receive a resilient flexible hose member to supply air under pressure to the chamber 120, and female threads at the opposite end of housing member 112 are adapted to threadably engage cooperating male threads on housing member 114. Housing member 114 has a reduced diameter outlet 124 which is also adapted to receive a resilient flexible tube in fluid tight relation and female threads at the opposite end of member 114 are adapted to engage male threads on the open end portion of a rigid sintered metal filter element 126. The housing member 114 has a substantially cylindrical, hollow interior 128 adapted to receive a resilient duck bill one way valve element 130 adapted to permit the flow of air through the element in the direction of outlet 124, but to collapse and prevent the flow of air in the reverse direction. Resilient valve element 130 is retained in the chamber 124 by a flange 132 disposed between a shoulder on the interior surface of housing member 114 and the open end of filter element 126. The filter element 126 is in the form of an elongate tube having one end open and the other end closed by an integrally formed end wall 134 A recessed slot 136 is formed in end wall 134 for receiving a screw driver blade, coin, or the like to facilitate installation and removal. The outside diameter of the filter element 126 is less than the inside diameter of air chamber 120 so that air flowing into the housing through inlet 122 can completely surround the filter element. The filter element 126 is formed from a corrosion and tarnish resistant sintered metal material, preferably a sintered stainless steel material, which will have adequate strength to withstand installation, removal and cleaning operations. Cleaning of the filter element can be accomplished by various means such as by reverse flow of air, by washing in water or a suitable solvent, or by use of an ultrasonic cleaning and sterilising equipment of the type frequently employed in dental offices. Preferably housing 112 is formed from a transparent material which will permit viewing of the filter element. Resilient valve element 130 can also easily be removed and replaced, at very low cost, so that the combined filter and one way valve assembly may be employed over extended periods of time. The ability of the filter element to be easily serviced makes use of the entire system more reliable than with the prior art disposable filter elements. Also, the one way valve element in the assembly prevents contamination of the filter element by reverse flow to powder containing air which might possibly occur during bleed off of the system. As shown in Figure 4, the pinch valve 64 includes a valve block 140 having a bore 142 extending therethrough and a counterbore 144 extending from one surface of the block 140 in coaxial relation with bore 142. A piston member 146 is slideably mounted in bore 142, with an enlarged head 148 on piston 146 being disposed in counterbore 144. A substantially disc shaped actuating diaphragm and seal member 150 is mounted on the end of block 140 and extends over the counterbore 144, with an inlet plate 152 extending over and retaining diaphragm sealing member 150 in position. Suitable fastener means, not shown, extend through openings in inlet plate 152 and threadably engage block 140 to retain the inlet and diaphragm in position with the diaphragm engaging the adjacent end surface of enlarged head 148. An inlet bore 154 is provided in inlet plate 152 to admit air from tube 66 through a suitable fitting 156. An arch shaped groove 158 is formed in valve block 140 on the surface opposite the diaphragm 150, with groove 158 extending diametrically across the bore 142, and a cover plate 160 is mounted on block 140 and extends over groove 158. The groove 158 is dimensioned to receive powder delivery tube 62, with the outer surface of tube 62 engaging the end of piston 146. When air under pressure is admitted through line 66 to act on the surface of diaphragm 150, piston 146 will be moved downward with sufficient force to collapse and firmly clamp the resilient tube 62 to positively stop the flow of air and cleaning powder through the tube. Diaphragm 150 has a resilient annular ring portion indicated schematically at 162 which permits the central portion of the diaphragm to move downward against enlarged head 148 upon the application of pressure through tube 66. Upon release of pressure from the tube 66, pressure in tube 62, acting through the resilient wall of the tube, will move piston 146 and diaphragm 150 back to the position shown in Figure 4. The continuous diaphragm 150 seals the chamber of the piston 146 and the enlarged head 148 to prevent any contamination which might be contained in the actuating air from entering and being trapped in the chamber. This results in a longer lasting, more trouble free operation of the valve and consequently a more positive shut off of air and cleaning powder through tube 62 when the solenoid actuated valve 70 is actuated to direct pressure air through tube 66. Further, the enlarged area of the diaphragm subjected to the pressure enables a greater force to be applied to the piston to further assure a positive shut off. Referring again to Figure 2, in accordance with the present invention the flow restricter in line 74 preferably is in the form of a threaded fitting having a small diameter orifice or bore 170 extending therethrough threadably mounted in body member 84 and communicating with an inlet opening 172 leading into the chamber 58. Also, filter 78 is preferably formed from sintered stainless steel and is mounted within housing 84 in communication with the air inlet 172. When pinch valve 84 is energized closed and valve 40 is also closed, pressure from chamber 58 will be bled off through the sintered filter 78 and flow restricting orifice 170. This gradual bleeding of pressure from within the chamber reduces the tendency of powder particles to be drawn from the chamber. Further, since the filter 78 is mounted inside the chamber, the necessity for a separate filtered bleed line for the chamber is eliminated. Referring again to Figure 1, with valve 40 open to admit air under pressure to flow into line 46, and with the pinch valve 64 closed, chamber 58 will be pressurised by air flowing through lines 54 and 74, but no cleaning powder will be dispensed. Under this condition, air will flow through flow restricter 50 and filter 52 to the handpiece and be continuously bled from the head 14 at the rate determined by the position of flow restricter valve 50. Upon actuation of foot control 36 to position solenoid valve 70 to open pinch valve 64, air and cleaning powder will immediately commence to flow through line 62 and be mixed with the air flowing through line 46 for discharging from the handpiece. During this time, air will flow through lines 54 and 74 simultaneously to provide the desired volume of cleaning powder in the air as determined by the position of baffle deflector 100.
