# NOISE FREE TERMINAL STATION COMPATIBLE WITH EXISTING MASTER STATIONS

## Abstract
A terminal station 3 operating with a current supplied from a master station 1 exchanges signals with it through cable conductors 65 67, 76, 78 , one of the cable conductors being grounded at the master station to allow the current to return from the terminal station. A receive circuit is formed by a first differential amplifier 60 and a first resistor network 61 64 connected in a balanced relationship to input termin als of the first differential amplifier for receiving a signal from the master station 1 in a noise cancelling relationship with respect to the ground potential to eliminate the effect of noise generated by the passage of the current through the ground conductor. A transmit circuit includes a second differential amplifier 70 and a second resistor network 71 74 connected in a balanced relationship to input termin als of the second differential amplifier for transmitting a signal to the master station 1 in a noise cancelling relation ship with respect to the ground potential to eliminate the effect of the noise at the output of the second differential amplifier.
