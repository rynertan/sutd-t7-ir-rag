# Cutting method and apparatus for tape laying machines.

## Abstract
A tape 100 is transported by a continuous strip of back ing paper 102 along a tape guide 22 into position for the tape 100 to be cut by a blade 12 . The tape guide 22 has an essentially flat center portion 24 and opposite side portions 28 that are inclined toward blade 12 relative to center por tion 24 . Side portions 28 are preferably smoothly curved. Side portions 28 guide the lateral edges of the tape 100 and paper 102 to bend toward blade 12 when a lateral cut is be ing made. This allows a cut of essentially constant depth to completely sever tape 100 , including any fibers 106 that have come loose from the edges of paper 102 , without sever ing paper 102 .
