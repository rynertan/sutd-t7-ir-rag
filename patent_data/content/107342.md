# PUMP ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
A pump assembly is disclosed which is driven by pul sating exhaust gases emanating from an internal combus tion engine. The pump assembly 10 includes a double act ing pump means 50 for pumping air from a source 20 etc. and having a reciprocable pumping member 52, and an ac tuating means 54 including a reciprocable actuating member 56 which is drivingly connected to the pumping member and is driven through first and second strockes to move the pumping member through first and second strokes, respectively, one side 272 of the actuating member being in communication with the exhaust gases, and the tuating member and pumping member being movable through their first stroke during the pressure increasing phase of each pressure pulsation and being moved through their second stroke by a first non linear variable rate spring means 60 during each pressure decreasing phase of each pressure pulsation during low to intermediate engine speeds and loads and by both the first and a second non linear variable rate spring means 62 during intermediate to high engine speeds and loads, whereby the pump assembly is operable to pump air from the source throughout a wide range of engine speeds and loads including high speeds and loads.
