## Description
The invention relates to a process for improving the adhesive strength of polyolefin articles to polar polymeric matrices, as well as for preparing polar matrix materials reinforced with these articles. It is known how to prepare composite reinforced materials by incorporating embedding in a matrix material, particularly a poly meric matrix material, a reinforcing material, for instance in the form of filaments. Examples of reinforcing materials include inorganic substances, such as glass fibres, and synthetic materials, such as polymer fibres. Highly attractive as reinforcing material seem to be polyolefin articles, for instance fibres, tapes or films, on acount of, inter alia, their low specific gravity, their low raw materials costs and their good chemical resistance. A major condition for applying such articles as reinforcing material is a high tensile strength, high modulus and a high adhesive strength. It is known how to prepare, for instance, filaments with a high tensile strength and modulus on the basis of solutions of high molecular polyolefins, particularly polyethylene, see US A 4,344,908, 4,411,854, 4,422,993, 4,430,383 and 4,436,689. It has been found, however, that the adhesive power of the resulting fibres to polar polymeric materials, which fibres consist of highly oriented polyole fin material as a result of the degree of stretching applied, is too low for many practical applications. It has already been proposed see EP A 62.491 to adhere and to embed polyolefin materials to and in thermosetting and thermo plastic matrices. According to this known process a highly oriented polymer material, for instance in the form of a fibre or film, having a stretch ratio of at least 12 1, is subjected for that purpose to a plasma discharge treatment, preferably after etching with chromic acid. The polymer material used in that process particularly consists of melt spun fibres of polyethylene, polypropylene or copolymers of these with a weight average molecular weight lower than 300,000, a tensile strenght of about 1 GPa and modulus of 30 40 GPa. A disadvantage of the known process is that the strength of the polymeric articles deteriorates very badly in the process and that in a manner virtually linear with the increase in adhesive strength. The present invention now provides a process for improving the adhesive strength of polyolefin articles to polar polymeric matri ces without any real deterioration of the strength of the articles. The invention therefore relates to a process for preparing polyolefin articles with great adhesive strength for polar polymeric matrices, which process is characterized in that a polyolefin article, whichis obtained by spinning or extruding a solution or melt of a linear polyeolfin having a weight average molecular weight of at least 4 10⁵, converting the article obtained after spinning or extrusion into a gel article by cooling and stretching this gel article at ele vated temperature, is subjected to a corona treatment with a total irradiation dosage of 0.05 3.0 Watt.minute m², effected intermit tently in dosages of 0.01 0.15 Watt.minute m², the treated article is coated with 0.5 5 wt , calculated as polymer on the article to be coated, of a 5 50 wt solution of a polar polymer and the article thus obtained is dried. The application of a corona treatment with plastics is known in itself, particularly for improving the printability of synthetic films, see for instance Tappi In the present invention the starting material is preferably a polyolefin filament, tape or film. The polyolefin articles used are particularly highly oriented polyolefin polyethylene filaments obtained by subjected gel fila ments to a high degree of strechting stretch ratio higher than 20 and having a very high tensile strength, for instance in the case of polyethylene higher than 2 GPa, and a very high modulus, for instance higher than 50 GPa. The high molecular linear polyolefin used is preferably polyethylene with a weight average molecular weight of at least 4 10⁵, specially of at least 8 10⁵, which may contain minor amounts, preferably 5 moles at most, of one or more other alkenes copolymerized with it, such as propylene, butylene, pentene, hexene, 4 methylpentene, octene, etc., and with at least 100 unbranched carbon atoms, and preferably with at least 300 unbranched carbon atoms bet ween carbon atoms provided with side chains with more than 1 C atom. The polyethylene may contain minor amounts, preferably 25 wt at most, of one or more other polymers, specially an alkene 1 polymer, such as polypropylene, polybutylene or a copolymer of propylene with a minor amount of ethylene. Besides, the polyolefin used may also be a high molecular linear polypropylene or ethylene propylene copolymer. In the present process the article is passed through a high frequency electric field generated, for instance, between an electrode and a guide roll by means of a high frequency generator and a trans former. The frequency used in this process is generally 10,000 to 30,000 Hz. In order to obtain a very finely distributed haze of discharges on the article the electrode is brought very close to the roll, for instance 0.5 5 mm. In this operation the article may be applied to, for instance a reel of film by which it is guided, or to the guide roll itself. Preference is given to applying an in line corona treatment in the winding or after the strechting of, for instance, a fibre, using a number of electrodes arranged in series. It has been found that in consequence of the corona treatment the temperature of the article rises. The temperature of the articles must, of course, be prevented in the process from locally exceeding the melting temperature. To this end the articles to be treated can, on the one side, be supplied, for instance, at ambient temperature and on the other side the chosen dosage to be used in the treatment will be such that the temperature does not locally exceed the melting tem perature. To this end an intermittent treatment is applied with small dosages. It has been found that in an intermittent treatment the mechanical properties of the article remain virtually the same when the dosage to be used in the treatment increases, whereas in the event of a large supplementary increase of the dosage, i.e. increase of the energy output per unit of time, the mechanical properties decrease. The total required dosage may vary, depending in part on the nature of the article and the matrix and the adhesive strength desired. Generally, a dosage of 0.05 3.0, particularly 0.1 2.0, and preferably 0.2 1.5 Watt.minute m² will be used. As the article has been found to melt when applying a single dosage larger than or equal to about 0.4 Watt.minute m², and as explained above a number of intermittent dosages are more advantageous than a single dosage, an intermittent treatment with small dosages of about 0.01 0.15 Watt.minute m² each is applied. In this treatment the spaces of time between the dosages are not directly critical. In view of the through put rate required for a technical realization, which is in order of the spinning rate, this space of time will generally, with the usual rol diameter, be smaller than 1 second. The corona treatment may possibly be carried out in an inert atmosphere, such as nitrogen, but is preferably carried out in the presence of a reactive gas, such as oxygen or carbon dioxide or air with a low 1 relative humidity. According to the invention the articles obtained after the corona treatment are coated with a polar polymer applied to the articles in the form of a solution. In this operation various coating techniques known per se can be applied, for instance immersing the article in a bath of the coating solution, passing the article, par ticularly a fibre, through the solution, or spraying or atomizing the solution onto the article to be coated. The polar polymeric coating material applied may be, inter alia, polyurethanes, polar polyethylene grades, epoxy resins or polyamids. Preference is given to applying a polyurethane, such as an aliphatic or aromatic polyurethane elastomer. As solvent various solvents known per se for polar polymers can ben used, for instance decalin, acetone, toluene, methylethyl ketone, ethanol, isopropanol, toluol or water. The amount of coating material applied may vary, depending in part upon the nature of this material, upon the article to be treated and upon the matrix material. Generally 0.5 10 wt , specifically 1 2 wt , polar polymer will be used, calculated on the article to be coated. The concentration of the coating solution to be used is not critical and is generally 5 to 50 wt . Preference is given to applying a 10 40 wt coating solution. The temperature in the coating operation may vary. Preference is given to realizing the invention at ambient temperature. If the coating material is a polar polyethylene, a temperature higher than the melting point of this polar polyethylene, for instance above 120 C, must be applied. According to the invention the coated articles are sub sequently dried or cured . This can be done by air heating, for instance to 90 120 C for 3 10 minutes. It has been found that after a corona treatment and coating operation such articles, specially filaments, have such a great adhe sive strenght for polymeric matrices that after embedding the articles in these matrices it was found no longer to be possible for these articles to be pulled loose without breaking the article in this operation. The tensile strenght and the modulus of the articles treated in this manner were found in this operation not to be lower than those of the non treated articles, or hardly so. The treated articles, unlike the films treated in the known processes, were found to retain their adhesive strenght for a long time. Even after more than four weeks storage the articles treated according to the invention could be embedded in a matrix of polymer material, in which operation the adhesive strength between article and matrix was hardly less than if they had been embedded immediately after the treatment. Surprisingly, another extra advantage was obtained in applying the present process, viz. an increase of the melting point of the articles after embedding. This is very important for a number of technical applications, particularly in the application of articles of polyethylene, which is known to have a reletively low melting point. The increase of the melting point of polyethylene embedded in a matrix was found to be about 8 C. The articles obtained in applying the invention can be incor porated in polymeric matrices in a manner known per se, for instance impregnation of fibres and winding. A general survey of customary techniques in these operations is given in Handbook of Composites by Luben G., published 1982 by van Nostrand Reinhold Co. New York . The polymeric matrices used may generally be any polar polymer material, such as epoxy, phenol, vinylester, polyester, acry late, cyanoacrylate and polymethylmethacrylate resins and polyamide materials. The matrix used is preferably an epoxy resin. The reinforced matrices thus obtained have a very wide techni cal application range, such as in boats, surfboards, glider and aircraft parts, printing plates, car parts, for instance bonnet, wings, etc. The invention is further elucidated in the following examples without, however, being limited thereto. High molecular polyethylene fibres having a tensile strength of 1.9 GPa, a modulus of 46 GPa and a filament titre of 112 dtex, pre pared via gel spinning of a polyethylene solution weight average molecular weight about 1.5 10⁶ according to the process described in the GB patent specification 2,051,667 were subjected to a corona treatment in an apparatus of the Mark II type of the firm of Vetaphone. In this operation an intermittent treatment of 24 dosages of 0.01 Watt.minutes m² was applied. The fibres thus treated had virtually the same tensile strength 1.85 GPa as the non treated fibres and a slightly higher modulus about 48 50 GPa . An epoxy resin mixture consisting of 100 parts by weight of a resin, grade Europox 730 RTM , and 15 parts by weight of a hardener, grade XE 278 RTM , available from the firm of Schering, was cast into a mould. Subsequently, the polyethylene fibres subjected or not subjected to a corona treatment were embedded and the whole of it was hardened at 60 110 C. Execution Into a cylindrical casting mould of silicone rubber with an inside diameter of D mm and previously cut into a half way its length the liquid resin was cast before hardening. Sub sequently the fibre was embedded in the mould via the incision of the silicone rubber, and the whole was hardened at elevated temperature. Now, by embedding in two silicone rubber moulds the con figuration resulted as represented diagrammatically in Figure 1. After hardening, the pull out strength was measured by means of an Instron 1195 tensile tester with special adapted grips for the cylindrical test bars. The grip length of th fibre between the two cylindrical matrices was 150 mm. The drawing speed was always 1 mm min and measurements were made at room temperature and 60 relative humidity. In the experi ments the chosen diameters were D₁ 9 mm and D₂ 5 mm. The adhesive strength between the fibres and the matrix was tested by means of a so called pull out test. In order to be able to properly differentiate between the treated and non treated fibres mutually, it is important for the fibre matrix interface to be adjusted and to be chosen correctly. For if the fibre matrix interface is too large, for instance if the embedded length is too great, if fibre will break in a pull out test and no differentiation will occur between the fibres. The results obtained are summarized in Table I. Fibres subjected or not subjected to a corona treatment having a composition as described in comparative example A were drawn at room temperature, at a speed of about 0.5 m minute, through a bath with a coating solution consisting of a 40 wt solution of an aro matic polyurethane elastomer in a mixture of 9 parts by weight methy lethylketone and 1 part by weight isopropyl alcohol. The polyurethane elastomer used in this operation was a product available from the firm of Scado under the name of Uraflex 85 A7 E. Successively the fibres were air dried for about 4 minutes at a temperature of 100 105 C. The fibres thus treated had virtually the same tensile strength and modulus as the non treated fibres. Subsequently the fibres were embedded in the same way as described in Example A and their pull out strength was determined. The results obtained are summarized in Table I. The process of example I was repeated on the understanding that the coating solution used was a 20 wt solution of an alipha tic polyurethane elastomer available under the name of Uraflex 190 E 1 from the firm of Scado in isopropyl alcohol. The results obtained are again summarized in Table I.
