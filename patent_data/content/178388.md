## Description
Title of the invention Quinolonecarboxylic acid derivetivesDetailed description of the invention This invention is concerned with certain novel useful quinolonecarboxylic acid derivatives of the following formula I ,EMI1.1 wherein R1 is hydrogen atom or lower alkyl group, R2 is hydrogen atom or methyl group and Y is chlorine or fluorine atom, the hydrates or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, with a process for their preparation, and with use as antibacterial agent. The present inventors have found that new compounds according to the present invention show better activity and broader spectrum both in vitro and in vivo against Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria than the previously known quinolonecarboxylic acid derivatives. The present compounds are well absorbed when given orally and very well tolerated on oral or parenteral administration in animals. The present compounds, therefore, are active at low doses against both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria and thus constitute valuable agents for the treatment of infectious human, animal or plant diseases. The compounds of the formula I are synthesized by reacting a compound of the formula II , EMI2.1 wherein X is halogen atom, R1 and Y are the same as defined above, with a compound of the formula III ,EMI2.2 wherein R is the same as defined above. The reaction is preferably carried out by heating the two reactants in a solvent such as water, alcohols, acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, hexamethylphosphoric triamide, pyridine, picoline andothe like or in absence of the solvent at a temperature of room to 2OO0C, preferably 60 to 1600C, more preferably 60 to 1200c for 1 to several hours.It is desirable that a slight excess 2 to 5 moles of the secondary amine of the formula III is used per mole of the compound of the formula II and a solvent is used such that the mixture remains homogeneous after dissolution of the compound of the formula II 2 to 20 fold volume of the compound of the formula III . When R1 in the formula 11 is lower alkyl, the reaction product carboxylic ester is saponified to the corresponding carboxylic acid by the usual manner. Furthermore, the compounds of the formula I can be converted, if desired, to the pharmaceutically acceptable piperazinium salts or carboxylic acid metal salts by treatment with acid or alkali. The acid may be organic or inorganic acids such as, for example, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, methanesulfonic acid, phosphoric acid, acetic acid and lactic acid.The carboxylic acid metal salts may be, for example, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, aluminum, cerium, chromium, cobalt, copper, iron, zinc, and silver salts. The compound of the formula I , hydrates and salts thereof may be used as medicines in the conventional form of pharmaceutical preparations, which may be, for example, tablets, capsules, powder, ointments, supositories, injections or eye drops, suitable for peroral, parenteral, enteral or local administration.
