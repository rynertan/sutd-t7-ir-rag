## Description
Method of forming a set of concrete piles. The invention relates to a method of forming a set of a predetermined number of concrete piles of relatively different diameters for coating slopes and the like. The use of concrete piles of relatively different diameters for coating slopes and the like is described in Dutch Patent Application 7503285.Such concrete piles are employed to replace the conventional columns of natural stone and up to now they are placed individually in polygonal relationship on a slope or the like, care being taken for the course of the joints between the columns to be most irregular, whilst straight interstices between the columns are failing so that an inhibiting effect is exerted on water flowing in. The downwardly tapering concrete columns are as far as possible in contact with one another in order to maintain an optimum bond between the columns even when one column sinks down from between the other columns. Such an individual disposition of the concrete columns on the site is a time consuming and tiring operation, whilst those who place the contrete columns mn the site have to be highly skilful. The method according to the invention is intended to provide a set of concrete piles, which set can be disposed as a unit in the job on a slope or the like, whilst the sets can be placed in joined positions side by side in order to obtain an at 1 ecst substantially complete coating of a slope, whereas nevertheless the concrete piles are disposed in an arbitrary array as required for such a slope. According to the invention this can be achieved by disposing concrete piles in polygonal relationship in the set in a manner such that on the different sides of the set are located such a number of piles that protruding parts of piles located or one side sufficiently fit between recesses located between the piles of another side, so that,when the sets are disposed side by side,the piles are also in polygonal relationship in the coating formed with the aid of the sets. It has surprisingly been found that when using such an array of piles an adequately irregular pattern of piles in a slope can be obtained by disposing such sets side by side and in contact with one another. It is a further advantage that the talus can be smoothly worked prior to the disposition of the sets. It should be noted that a method of manufacturing such a set is disclosed in Dutch Patent 3pecification 156.082. However, this patent does not disclose a design for a polygonal set suitable fcr providing an irregular array of the piles in the job when such sets are arranged side by side. The invention will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying Figures. Fig. 1 is a schematic plan view of one embodiment of a set in accordance with the invention. Fig. 2 is a schematic plan view of part of the coating of a slope or the like, said part comprising six sets of the kind shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 3 shows part of the coating near a boundary wall thereof. The embodiment of a set in accordance with the invention shown in Fig. 1 has an at least substantially square shape and is bounded on a first side by four concrete piles 1 to 4 and on a side at right angles to the former by four concrete piles 4 to 7, on a third side by four concrete piles 7 to 10 and on the fourth side by the concrete piles 1 and 10 and the intermediate concrete piles 11 and 12. In a corner of the more or less quadranguiar space enclosed by the said concrete piles are arranged one further concerete pile 13 and four concrete piles 14 to 17 of smaller diameter than the concrete pile 13. All concerete piles have a sectional area in the form of an irregular octogon and the piles of one set have substantially equal heights their diameters are, however, different as will be apparent from Fig.1. The concrete piles 1 and 7 located in two diametrically opposite corners of the set have appreciably larger diameters than the piles II and 10 located in the tw6 other diamtrically opposite corners. The further piles 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9 and 11, 12 located on the sides of the set and between the piles at the corners have smaller diameters than the biggest piles 1 and 7 at the corners and larger diameters than the slehder piles 4 and 10. Of the intermediate piles the pile located nearest the smallest pile at a corner, for example, the pile 3 located near the pile 4, has a larger diameter than the intermediate pile, for example, the pile 2 located nearest the largest corner pile of the largest diameter, for example, the pile 1.From Fig. 1 it is apparent that the piles are disposed so that the outer boundary edges of the sets have an angular shape. The shape and the array are furthermore such that the sets can be Joined side y side as is shown in Fig. 2. This Figure shows six sets, the piles of each set being designated by the same reference numerals as used for the corresponding piles of the set shown in Fig. 1 and the various sets are reparately designated by the reference characters A to F.From the Figure it will be apparent that the salient part of the pile 1B fits to an adequately accurate extent in the recess between the piles 4A and 5A located on the other side of the set, whilst the pile 12B fits in a similar manner between the piles 5A and 6A, the pile 11n fits in a similar manner between the piles 6A and 7A, whilst the salient part of the pile 7A is enclosed between the piles 1B and lOB. In an analogous manner the pile 10A fills out the space between the piles 1D and 2D,whereas the pile 9A lies in the space bounded by the neighbouring piles 2D and 3D and the pile 8A lies in the space between the piles 3D and 4D. The pile 4D lies in the space between the piles 8A and 7A. At the boundary side of a coating of a slope the coating is, however, required to follow, as far as possible, a straight line, for example, in order to obtain a satisfactory joint with further structures, such as sheet piles or the like. According to the invention, whilst maintaining the advantages aimed at, this can be achieved by using sets of the structure shown in Fig. 3 at the side concerned of the coating. Such a side set comprises the piles 1 to 6 and 11 to 17 corresponding with and arranged like the piles 1 to 6 and 11 to 17 of the sets described above. However the pile 7 used in the above mentioned sets is replaced by two smaller piles 18 and 19, which together with the piles 4 and 6 form one side of the set concerned. Moreover, the piles 8 to 10 are replaced by slightly larger piles 20 ro 22. As will be seen from Fig. 3, the piles 19 to 22 located on one side of the set are arranged in the set in a manner such that the boundary faces of these piles 19 to 22 located at the outer edge of the set are lying at least substantially in a straight plane so that on this side of the set a satisfactory connection with sheetpiles or the like can be obtained, whilst the piles of neighbouring sets again fit to one another in the desired manner. From Figs. 2 and 3 it will be apparent that the sets of a structure as shown in Fig. 1 and 3 respectively can be disposed side by side without causing an undesirable regular course of the joints between the sets. It is therefore, possible to manufacture such sets by the economic method disclosed in Dutch Patent Specification 156.082 and to transport these sets to the building site, where the sets can be placed as a coherent unit by means of an appropriate tool on a slope so that such a slope can be readily and economically built up without the need for much skill of the workers disposing such sets. Although the invention is described with reference to a substantially square set, it will be obvious that, for example, also rentangular, polygonal or triangular sets may be employed. It will,however, have to be ensured that the polygonal array of the piles in the set is maintained so that, when a block drops out of a set, the bond between the remaining blocks will not get lost.
