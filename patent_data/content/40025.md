# Real time data compression decompression scheme for facsimile transmission system.

## Abstract
A graphic image represented by a two level pel to pel definition is compressed by one dimensional redundancy reduction coding using an entropy preserving algorithm which allows for real time reduction of the pel to pel data without any loss in image resolution. The compressed data is concatenated for transmission and then separated and decoded back to a pel to pel format for defining a facsimile image.
