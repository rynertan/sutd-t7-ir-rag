# Multichannel magnetic head, apparatus using such a head and manufacturing method for such a head.

## Abstract
A multichannel magnetic head has a Hall element which is disposed in a magnetic circuit which is traversed by a magnetic flux to be detected and which is used as magne tic electric converting means. Said Hall element 14 com prises an amorphous magnetic thin film consisting of an alloy containing a rare earth element and a transition metal, to said amorphous magnetic thin film 14 are connected a pair of current terminals 20, 22 and Hall voltage terminals 16₁ to 16₇ corresponding in number to the number of chan nels of said multichannel head, and said amorphous thin film 14 is arranged in magnetic circuits of a plurality of chan nels.
