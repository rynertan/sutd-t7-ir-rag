# Phrase programmable digital speech system.

## Abstract
A digital speech processor 200 operates in parallel with a programmable digital computer 102 to generate sequen ces of variable length speech phrases and pauses at the request of the computer. A speech memory 214 within the speech processor contains digitally encoded speech data segments of varying length. A separate command memory region in 214 accessible to and loadable by the computer, can be loaded with a plurality of commands. When sequen tially executed by the speech processor, these commands cause the processor to generate an arbitrary sequence of spoken phrases and pauses without intervention by the com puter. Each two byte command causes the speech processor to retrieve from the speech memory a particular speech data segment and convert it into speech, or to pause for a time interval specified by a number within the command. When the programmable digital computer is not operating the speech processor to synthesize spoken words, the speech and com mand memory regions are used as auxiliary random access memory to increase the size of the memory space of the computer.
