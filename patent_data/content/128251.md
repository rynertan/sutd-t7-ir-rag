# Multispeed gearbox.

## Abstract
A main gear comprises dual clutches C1 and C2 operating in conjunction with synchronised selectors A and B to enable power shifting changes between four basic gears. The clutches C1 and C2 control odd and even numbered gears respectively. A range gear has a selector D whereby the main gear output shaft 13 is either coupled to the range gear output shaft 14 directly or by way of speed reducing gears G8B, G8T, G4T and G4B . The latter gearwheel G4B is coupled to the shaft 14 by a selector E which alternatively selects reverse gear. Speeds 1, 2, 3 and 5, 6, 7 are provided in this conventional manner. How ever speed 4 is provided direct to the output shaft 14 through the gears G4T and G4B with the selector B to the left and selector E to the right. This makes power shifting possible not only within each range but also be tween the high and low ranges. Speed 8 is provided by gears G8T and G8B with the selector B to the left and selector D engaging both to the left and the right so as to couple gearwheel G8B to the output shaft 14 .

## Description
MULTISPEED GEARBOX The present invention relates to a multispeed gearbox for a vehicle, especially suitable for an agricultural or earth working vehicle. The gearbox is a multispeed powershift gearbox comprising a dual clutch main gear in cascade with a range gear selecting between low and high speed ranges. A powershift gearbox is a gearbox which can be shifted under load, making use of its own clutches and or brakes rather than relying on an external clutch. Epicyclic gears have been used for decades in powershift gearboxes but they suffer from various disadvantages. The number of gear wheels is large which means many bearings, many meshes, higher frictional losses and increased complexity and expense. For this reason there is considerable interest in spur gearboxes and a dual clutch gearbox enables powershifting with such a gearbox. The two clutches engage the odd and even numbered gears respectively so that, when one clutch is engaged, the selector associated with the other clutch is not under load and may be shifted to preselect the next gear up or down, as required. When a range gear is cascaded with the dual clutch main gear a problem arises in enabling full powershifting. The dual clutches of the main gear do not allow preselection of a different gear of the range gear, which is under load. Many solutions to this problem exist, including use of an epicyclic range gear. It is also known IDE 3 024 862 to provide an additional coupling which can be engaged to bypass the main dual clutch and range gears and which provides gear ratios in between the ranges. While such a coupling is engaged the range gear can clearly be preselected but this represents a complex and expensive solution. The object of the present invention is to provide an improved gearbox which uses spur gears in both the main and range gears but allows full powershifting under control of themain gear clutches. The invention is characterised in that both the main gear and the range gear are spur gears with their gearwheels arranged on the same two shaft lines and in that one gearwheel pair of the main gear couples directly into the range gear so as to bypass a high low selector thereof. Although arrangements in accordance with the invention are possible with the range gear preceding the main gear, in the preferred embodiment the range gear follows the main gear, the main gear is a top shaft synchronised gear, and the said one gearwheel pair provides the top speed in the low range and drives into the range gear output shaft downstreamofthe high low selector. It is economical if the said one gearwheel pair is one of first and second gearwheel pairs providing a step down ratio when the range gear selector selects low range. The high low selector couples the main gear bottom shaft directly to the range gear output shaft for the high range. A second selector in the range gear is provided for disconnnecting the direct drive into the range gear output shaft. This is necessary to allow preselection of the top gear in the low range. The second selector preferably alternatively selects reverse. An arrangement as described in the preceding paragraph allows a particularly advantageous development of the invention.Since the top gear in the low range is provided by a direct drive into the range gear output shaft, it is no longer possible to obtain a corresponding top gear in the high range by normal use of the range gear. In some cases it is possible to dispense with this high range top gear but it is preferred to provide it by using the second gearwheel pair of the range gear to drive directly into the range gear output shaft. This is possible when the high low selector of the range gear is so constructed as to be able to effect both of its couplings simultaneously. These and other advantageous features of an embodiment of the invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings which are provided by way of example and in which Fig 1 is a schematic plan view of a gearbox embodying the invention, and Fig. 2 is a cross section of one selector of the gearbox. An outline will first be given of the layout of the gearbox shown in Fig. 1, before proceeding to a detailed description of the various parts thereof. The elements of the gearbox are laid out mainly on two longitudinal shaft lines I and II which lie in the same horizontal plane. In Fig. 1 the front of the vehicle is to the left. The shaft line is centrally disposed while the shaft line I is offset laterally, to the righthand side in the illustrated embodiment Power flow proceeds from a main transmission input shaft 10 on the first shaft line I to two main gearbox clutches C1 and C2 which drive respective top shafts 11 and 12.These top shafts are hollow and the input shaft 10 passes therethrough. In most gears of the gearbox, power flows from the driven topshaft 11 or 12, a corresponding selector A or B and the gearwheel pair thereby selected, to a hollow bottom shaft 13 on the shaft line II. The shaft 1o is coupled to a hollow output shaft 14 on the same shaft line II by way of the range gear which provides a step down ratio or direct drive in accordance with the position of a selector D. Various ancillary features of the gearbox will now be described. The input shaft 10 can also be coupled by a clutchC3 to a hollow shaft 15. This drives a PTO shaft 16 by way of a pair of spur gears 17 and also drives a charge pump within the gearbox casing by way of a pair of spur gears 18 This pump provides hydraulic power for implements attached to the vehicle. In a simple version of the gearbox the input shaft 10 is driven directly from the engine although devices such as shock absorbers and universal joints may naturally be included .The gearbox will then provide a total number of forward gears equal to the number of main gears multiplied by two. Thus in the illustrated embodiment, the main gear has four gears, the range gear provides two ranges and the total number of gears is eight. When the range of gears has to be extended, the shaft 19 from the engine can be coupled to the main input shaft 10 by way of a splitter gear 20 multiplying the number of gears by two or three depending on the splitter gear stages. As illustrated, the splitter gear is a conventional epicyclic gear providing direct drive when a clutch C4 is engaged, under drive when a brake F1 is engaged and over drive when a brake F2 is engaged. The corresponding gear ratios will be explained below but no detailed description of the construction of splitter gear is required. The main gears are also available in reverse. The illustrated embodiment moreover makes provision for four wheel drive again this is an optional feature. Specifically, the output shaft 14 drives a longitudinal differential 21 from which power flows to the rear wheels by way of a shaft 22 extending rearwardly through the hollow shafts 13 and 14 to a bevel gear 23. This gear drives a transverse differential 24 which divides the power between half shafts 25R and 25L. The differential 24 is provided in well known manner with a lock, preferably hydraulically actuated. The main rearwheel brakesF3 and F4 are also built into the gearbox on the half shafts. A front wheel drive shaft 26 extends forwardly from the longitudinal differential 21 and drives a front transverse differential dividing power between the front wheel half shafts.These latter elements are not shown and represent the only parts of the transmission outside the gearbox. The longitudinal differential 21 is provided with a lock clutch c5 which enables all power to be routed to the rear wheel or front wheel drive, depending on soil conditions. There is thereby provided a particularly compact design whereby virtually all components of the transmission, the rearwheel brakes, the PTO drive and charge pump are contained within one gearbox casing 27 having suitable partition walls 28 for the necessary shaft bearings. In particular, the casing 27 can be a lightweight casting which does not form part of the frame structure of the vehicle. The gearbox is mounted in and given structural integrity by a full frame of the vehicle. Moreover, the shaft lines I and II as well as the half shafts 25R and 25L are preferably arranged all at the same level at the parting plane between bottom and cover parts of the gearbox casing 27. This makes it easy to assemble the components of the gearbox into the casing before fitting the cover part and maintenance is also greatly simplified.ThePTO shaft 16 on the other hand must be arranged at either a higher cr lower level so as not to interfere with the half shaft 25R and the shaft 16 is therefore not journal led at the parting plane but through either the cover part or bottom part of the casing 27. All these features are explained in more detail in our prior European Patent Application No. 83 300 039.1 Publication No. It is also convenient to mention at this stage that the PTO shaft 16 is not driven directly from the engine input shaft 19 but is driven from the main input shaft 10 downstream of the splitter gear 20. This enables more efficient PTO operation as described more fully in our co pending application of even date Application No. , PublicationNo. filed under Reddie Grose file number 25655 with the title Vehicle Transmission with PowerTake Off. Attention will now be given to the detail of the main gear and the range gear. As already noted, the main gear has dual clutches C1 and C2 and corresponding selectors A and B.The range gear has the previously mentioned high low selector D and also has a reverse low selector E. The various gearwheels are denoted as follows. Gearwheels G1T and G1B are on the top and bottom shaft respectively, as indicated by the final lettersT and B, and constitute gearwheel pair for speed 1 of the main gear, as indicated by the first twc symbols G1. Similarly there are gearwheel pairs for second, third and fourth speeds and labelled G2T, G2B and G3T, G3B and G4T, G4B. The corresponding speeds 1, 2, 3 and 4, which are the speeds in the low range of the range gear, are indicated along the top of the diagram. The high range speeds are indicated in brackets as 5, 6, 7 and 8.Another gearwheel pair G8T, G8B is provided for speed 8.Finally gearwheels GRT, GRR and GRB are provided for reverse, denoted at the top by the letter R. All gearwheels are in constant mesh and the selectorsA, B, D and E are synchronised selectors. So far as speeds 1, 2, 3 and 5, 6, 7 are concerned, the main gear is a conventional dual clutch, top synchronised constant mesh gearbox. The gearsG1B, G2B and G3B are all fast with the bottom shaft 13. The selector A engages either G1T or G3T lodd gears to the top shaft 11 while the selector B can engage the even numbered gearsG2T, G4T and G8T to the top shaft 12. Speeds 4 and 8 are provided in a different manner and the corresponding gearwheel pairs also function as the step down gears of the range gear. The gears G4T, G8T and GRT are all integral with another hollow shaft 29 on the shaft line I and are driven by the top shaft 12 when the selector B is shifted to the left in Fig. 1. The gear wheel pair G8B, G8T together with the pair G4T, G4B function as the step down gears of the range gear, and the low speeds 1, 2 and 3 are selected by shifting the selector D to the right to couple the bottom shaft 13 to the gear G8B. The selector E must also be shifted to the right to couple the gear G4B to the output shaft 14. On the other hand, the high range gears 5, 6 and 7 are selected by shifting the selector D to the left to couple the bottom shaft 13 directly to the output shaft 14. Speed 4 is selected with the selector E still to the right and with the selector B to the left. The gearwheel pairG4T, G4B drives direct into the output shaft 14. Speed 8 on the other hand, also obtained with the selector B to the left, requires the gear G8B to be connected directly to the output shaft 14.This is achieved by a special construction of the selector D which effectively comprises two individually operable selectors so that both may be engaged simultaneously. This is symbolised by the double line showing of the selector D. When the selectorD is engaged both to the right and to the left it can be seen that the gearwheel G8B is coupled through the selector to the output shaft 14. It can also be seen that in each of speeds 1, 2, 3 and 4 it is possible to engage reverse by shifting the selector E to the left. Table 1 at the end of this description summarises the way in which the speeds 1 to 8 are obtained under control of the clutches C1 and C2 and the selectors A, B, D and E. The abbreviations ENG and DIS mean engaged and disengaged respectively while the letters L and R indicate shifting of a selector to the left and right respectively in Fig. 1. In the columns A, B, D and E a dash indicates that the position of the selector is immaterial. It is this factor which makes possible preselection of speeds and the basic pattern of dual clutch operation is readily apparent from columns C1 and C2 indicating the alternate engagement of these clutches. As an example, take the situation in speed 2 with the clutch C2 engaged and the position of the selector A immaterial. Because of this latter factor, the selector A can be shifted either to the left or right depending upon whether the driver wishes to select an up change or a down change. Power shifting is then effected simply by disengaging the clutch C2 and engaging the clutch C1 . If the selector D were involved in normal manner in selection of speed 4 , power shifting between speeds 4 and 5 would be impossible because the selector D would have to be set to the right for speed 4 and to the left for speed 5 . This constraint is avoided by the invention in that the selector D is by passed in speed 4 and its position is immaterial. It may therefore be preselected either to the left or the right for an up shift to speed 5 or a down shift to speed 3 and the pattern of dual clutch operation continues uninterrupted through the speeds 3,4,5. The selector E needs to be the right in speeds 1 to 4 and it must be disengaged in speed 8. As previously indicated the selector D has to be engaged both to the left and the right in speed 8. In speed 7 it has to be engaged to the left.As between speeds 7 and 8 it is therefore necessary to consider the engagement and disengagement of the selector D.Take the case of an upshift from speed 7 to speed 8 power is flowing from the shaft 13 through the selector D to the shaft 14 but the gears G8B, G8T, G4T and G4B are all idle. Therefore the additional engagement of selector D to the right is possible and speed 8 is engaged when the odd speed clutch G1 is disengaged and the even speed clutch C2 is engaged. On the other hand, for a step down from speed 8 to speed 7 it is merely necessary to change over the clutches once again and the selector D can then be disengaged on the righthand side. The control of the various clutches and selectors can basically follow conventional principles whether selection is purely by way of mechanical linkages or, as is preferred, by way of hydraulic actuators. Controlling logic can readily be provided to establish the desired pattern or selection for each change of speed. In particular the control of the selector E may be linked to that of the selector D in the manner which is apparent from the columns D and E of Table 1. Fig. 2 shows a possible construction for the selectorD. The hollow shaft 13 has the gearwheel G8B journalled thereon and the synchroniser body 30 is splined to this shaft. On the opposite side of the synchroniser body, instead of another gearwheel, there is provided a collar 31 integral with the hollow output shaft 14. On the two sides of the synchroniser body 30 there are provided separate clutch bodies 32 and separate synchroniser rings 33. Similarly there are two separate collars 34 shifted by respective claws 35 and effecting coupling of the synchrcniser body 30 to the gearwheel G8B on the one hand and the collar 31 on the other hand. A four speed main gear in conjunction with a two speed range gear employing spur gear wheels in the normal manner will provide four speeds with a single mesh and four speeds with three meshes. It is a particular advantage of the arrangement described that the number of speeds with only one mesh is increased to five. Thus, speed four is additionally a single mesh speed and this is advantageous on grounds of economy in that the fourth speed is a particularly important one in practical operation. As to the speeds themselves, Table 2 shows the complete range of ground speeds in kilometres per hour for an engine speed of 2 ,000 r.p.m and in the case where a three speed splitter gear 20 is provided with speeds L, M and H. M is direct drive clutchC4 whereas H is overdrive brake F2 at a step up ratio of 1.2386. L is underdrive brake F1 with a step down ratio of 0.8074. The eight speeds 1 to 8 are substantially in a geometric progression, the ratios between these speeds being shown between the rows of Table 2. In direct drive M the eight speeds provide a range of speeds from 1.6 to 32 km h with an average speed ratio of 1.5371. Underdrive L provides intervening speeds and a lowest speed of 1.3 km h. Apart from providing a top speed cf 40 km h, overdrive H essentially duplicates the top seven underdrive L speeds.There are therefore in total seventeen usefully different ground speeds which is adequate even for very large tractors. The duplication of speeds as between underdrive and overdrive provides flexibility in relating the PTO speed to the ground speed, as explained more fully in the above mentioned co pending application of even date. For example, if the PTO shaft requires a higher speed, without increasing the ground speed, it is possible to shift up to overdrive in the splitter gear 20 with a compensating step dcwn by way of the main gear and range gear.
