# Method and apparatus for planting seed in germinating tray.

## Abstract
A seed planter 10 is disclosed which plants seed, one row at a rime, into a plant seeding tray. A seed receiving depression is formed in the tray by a punch 80 . A seed pickup bar 18 reciprocates between a seed hopper 14 and a top seed receiving bar 19 where seed is dispensed into an aper ture 20 where the seed is conveyed to the tray. The seed hop per 14 is vibrated by a motor 85 to keep the seed evenly dispersed. Seed is held on seed receiving nozzles 21 by a vacuum pressure until discharged, when positive pressure is delivered through the nozzles 21 . An entry trigger 63 and an exit trigger 64 push each tray from the entry end of the seed planter 10 through the exit end one row of compartments at a time. The seed pickup bar 18 , entry triggers 63 and exit triggers 64 and punch 80 are driven by the rotation of drive motor 30 . Provision is made to accommodate different sized trays. Also, microswitches 102, 103 are provided which sense the presence of a tray in seed planter 10 and permit dis pensing of seed only when the tray is in seed receiving posi tion.
