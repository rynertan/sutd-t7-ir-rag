# Water soluble drug complex and method for production of same.

## Abstract
The invention provides a method of producing a water soluble complex comprising a water insoluble drug and a phospholipid, comprising the steps of 1 dissolving a water insoluble drug and a phospholipid in an organic solvent, 2 removing the solvent to leave behind a drugcontaining phospholipid film, 3 suspending the resulting film in an aqueous solution, 4 ultrasonicating the film, 5 centrifuging the resulting suspension, and 6 recovering the lowermost layer of the resulting sediment to yield the water soluble complex. The above complex can be administered parenter ally as well as by the oral and other routes, and is so rich in the drug component that a remarkably increased drug activity can be realized.
