## Description
PiASR DOMAI 4 LOGGER The present inventjon relates to a method for monitoring ttle condition, isolating faults and forecasting failures in a Illechanical motion transmission system witlwout the need for dismantling. Based upon the principle of engineering dynamics it is possible to perform the above functions provided that the following parameters can be acquired from one or more, judiciously selected moving elements within the system substantially instantaneous displacement, substantially instantaneous absolute velocity and substantially instantaneous acceleration.Hereinafter, these three parameters are referred to as the complete dynamic picture . Methods for assessing the condition, isolating faults and forecasting failures in mechanical motion transmission systems are known in the prior art the methods are related to internal combustion engines. An example of a prior art method includes the U.S. Patent to Radcliffe et al. In this method average acceleration measurements of the pistons are derived during each power stroke and are based upon relative speed measurements taken at the beginning and end of each power stroke. A low piston acceleration relative to the other pistons, for example, is indicative of an unhealthy condition for that piston cylinder combination. Another prior art method includes the U.S Patent to Bouverie and Nanas. In this method a proximity sensor, mounted on the flywheel housing, detects the passage and generates an electrical signal for each successive ring gear tooth on the flywheel. Time interval samples are derived between ea h pair of successive gear teeth. The time interval samples are stored, combined and algorithms are applied to them in a computer to produce overall type performance i.e. power loss with a cylinder . The present invention provides improvements over that suggested by such prior art. More particularly, a the method is not limited to an internal combustion engine but is applicable to any mechanical motion transmission system b a complete dynamic picture can be produced c no computer operationor algorithms are required d by shifting the velocity data by a predetermined amount, a digital filter is provided for aiding in the fault isolation process. The present invention is composed of three basic units the time to velocity converter, the parameter generator dnd the digital filter. The time to velocity converter senses successive increments of motion equi angular or equi distant from a moving element within a system and measures the time interval between each successive increment pair. The time interval samples are inversely proportional to the absolute velocity i.e. velocity with dimensions . If the increments of motion are very small, say less than one degree, then a measure of substantially instantaneous, absolute velocity is provided. By way of example assume that a shaft position digital encoder generates a fixed, equal angle K every one half degree. If the time interval T between a certain angle IC is 0.02 seconds, then the substantially instantaneous, absolute, angular velocity W is 250 degrees per second according to the following equation K K o 5 0.5 degrees 25 degrees second T 0.02 secondsThe velocity is considered the key parameter from two points of view. Firstly, it is used to derive all other functions associated with the invention. Secondly, it is directly proportional to the coulomb friction within the system. The parametric generator operates on each time interval sample generated by the time to velocity converter and derives a measure of substantially instantaneous displace nent and substantially instantaneous acceleration. This is accorrplished in a digital manner and consists of an integration and differentiation process respectively. The operations involve data shifting, addition and subtraction. The digital filter also operates on each time interval sample generated by the time to velocity converter.Specifically, the time interval samples are delayed by a predetermined number of fixed angles followed by an addition and subtraction process. This can result in the cancellation or enhancement of various velocity contributions of a periodic nature within the system. The essence of title invention lies in the fact that the time interval samples associated with each fixed angle of the machine cycle are operdted upon in the phasedomain rather than the time donain. This offers the distinct advantage thdt all operations i.e. differentiation, intecjra tion, etc. are independent of time and frequency considerations. Further clarification of this essential point is provided in the subsequent specification by way of graphical analysis. Other objects, features and advantages of the invention will be readily apparent from the following description of certain preferred embodiments thereof, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings although variations and modifications may be effected without departing from the spirit and scope of the novel concepts of the disclosure and in which Figure 1 is a general block diagram illustrating the invention and a unit under test. Figure 2 consists of plots indicating the relationship between time interval and velocity as a function of the digital encoder angle. Figure 3 is a detailed block diagram of the parametric generator with the plots comprising a complete dynamic picture . Figure 4 is a detailed block diagram of the digital filter. Figure 5 are plots of velocity before and after filtering. Figure 6 are plots showing a complete dynamic picture in the time domain. Turning to Figure 1, there is shown a oear box logger 1 in conjunction with the pnase domaine 9 through 24. The gear box mechanism 1 is considered as a unit under test and is constructed in a simple manner such that the theory of fault isolation can be readily illustrated and described in the subsequent specification. A synchronous electric motor 4 is powered by an a c source 5. Gear 3, located on the motor shaft, drives gear 2 which has twice the diameter of gear 3. A shaft position ehcoder 6, located on the shaft of gear 2, provides a successive series of 500 electrical pulses P1, P2 PSOO for each revolution of said encoder and applies them to the time to velocity converter TVC 9 by way of wire 7. Further, a reference pulse PREp is applied to both the parametric generator PG 11 and tEle digital filter DF 21 by way of wire 8 to indicate when encoder 6 completes each cycle of revolution. The parametric generator PG 11 operates on the pulses provided by lines 8 and 10 and produces a complete dynamic picture of gear 2 and its interaction with the other moving elements. More particularly, the measurement of displacement B, velocity Wand acceleration a are provided in digital format at outputs 12, 15 and 18 respectively. The latter signals are also applied to the digital to analog converters DAC 13, 16 and 19 respectively to provide measurements of B, W and cud in analog format at outputs 14, 17 and 20 respectively. The digital filter DF 21 also operates on the pulses provided by lines 8 and 10 to produce a filtered velocityWat output 22. The digital output 22 is applied to a digital to analog converter DAC 23 to produce the same information in analog format at output 24. The purpose of the time to velocity converter TVC 9 is to provide a measurement of time interval T between each successive fixed angle K generated by the digital encoder 6. The measurement of the time interval T can be obtained from a digital counting device whereby a pulse from the digital encoder 6 initiates the count and whereby the next successive pulse from the said encoder both terminates the count and re initiates the next counting cycle. As the design of such digital counting devices is well known in the state of the art, no detailed circuitry is provided in this specification. Turning next to Figure 2, there is shown two plots which illustrate by example the inverse relationship of the time interval T and the angular velocity DJ as related to the time to velocity converter 6. One plot displays the time interval T versus the angular displacement of the encoder 6. The other plot displays velocity Versus the same angular displacement p. As the digital encoder 6 produces 500 pulses per revolution 3609 the value of each fixed angle K is 0.720. The three steady state values of angular velocity shown on the pfot are derived as follows EMI5.1 Turning to Figure 3 there is shown a detailed block diagram of the parametric generator PG 11 Fig. 1 .The position counter 21 1 and preset 21 2 generate the measurement of the displacement 8 by counting or adding each fixed angle pulse Pn beginning with the reference pulse PREF. The preset 21 2 establishes the number of pulses in the machine cycle which is 500 in the case of the gear box 1 At 1 . At the end of the machine cycle the process is re initiated producing another ramp function. Time counter 21 6 provides a inea Qra of the machine cycle time MCU . Concerning the measurement or velocity bJ, there is no mechanization it is nerely a feedthrough from wire 10 Fig. 1 . The angle delay 21 3, delay adjust 21 4 and the subtractor 21 5 generate the measurement of the acceleration . This is accomplished by delaying the measurement of velocity LAiby one fixed angle K and performing a subtraction process with the undelayed pulse. In effect, this is a differentiation process. The dynamic picture shown in Figure 3 is in the phase domain because the independent variable i.e. x axis consists of fixed angle pulses Pnw When the parameters ,bJ and i are applied to a display device,the independent variable is in terms of time and the picture is thus established in the time domain. Time domain and phase domain pictures appear generally the same, except the time domain pictures are stretched or compressed to various degrees along the independent axis when compared to the phase domain picture. Turning to Figure 4 there is shown the d t.sZ8 the digital fitter 21 Fiqure 1 . The filter 21 consists of a digital delay line 23 3, a delay adjust 21 2, an adder 21 3, a divider 23 4 and a subtractor 21 5. The purpose of the filter 21 is to determine the cyclic velocity contributions of the various moving elements, if any. Turning next to Figure 5, there is shown a series of velocity plots. The purpose of these plots is to explain the operation of the filter 21. Plot A represents the unfiltered velocity information from the time to velocity converter 9 Figure 1 . Plot represents Plot A delayed by 1600 i.e. delayed by 1800 in fixed angle counts . PlotsB and C represent the velocity fluctuations associated with gears 3 and 2 respectively. Such fluctuations are representative of eccentric, mass unbalances on both gears. The de synthesization of the original waveform A into the various components B and C is based upon Fourier theory. The division by two in the mechanization process relates to the second harmonic. More particularly, gear 3 rotates at twice the frequency as gear 2. The latter is considered to rotate at the fundamental frequency. Finally, turning to Figure 6 there is shown an example of a complete dynamic picture of the gear box mechanism 1 Fig.l in the tin e domain. For example purposes, data anomalies have been introduced into the dynamic picture which reflect two faults in the gear box mechanism 1. A graphical analysis leading to the isolation of the faults is provided below. Turning first to the plot of angular velocity versus tinle, it is indicated that the velocity remains within the normal operating ranqe until machine cycle MC 2, at which time it reduces below the normal operating range and remains at that level. Such a condition can be related to excessive coulomb friction in the system and or low power output from the electric motor 4 Fig. 1 . The reduction in speed also reflects a deceleration M and an increase in the period of machine cycle MC 2 and 3 as compared to MC 1. Again, in reference to the plot of angular velocity W, there is indicated a series of velocity transients. By inspecting the plot of displacement 6 versus tiiie it is indicated that the transients occur tw cUeU i each machine cycle at the same anguldr displacement i.e. 1800 and 3600 . Such an dnon,aly is probably related to a damaged gear tooth on gear 3 Fig 1 . This stems from the fact that gear 3 makes two revolutions for each revolution of gear 2. It is pointed out that for any mechanical motion transmission system, the slowest moving element in the system establishes the machine cycle 3600 . If the digital encoder or other suitable sensor is not co located on the shaft of the slowest moving element, then the machine cycle must be established in terms of the shaft rotation on which the digital encoder is located. For example, if the digital encoder 6 had been attached to the shaft of gear 3, then the machine cycle 3600 would be equivalent to two revolutions of gear 3 or 7200 As evidenced from the graphical analysis another important feature of the invention is the fact that it provides a new concept for vibration test and analysis. In the prior art methods it is not possible to isolate faults to the same degree because a the full dynamic picture can not be generated, b no suitable vibration sensors are available to measure angular acceleration, c the filters are frequency sensitive. Although the invention has been described with respect to preferred pmhodiments, it is not to be so limited as changes and modifications can be made which are within the fuzzy intended scope as defined by the appended claims.
