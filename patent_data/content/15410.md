# Textile machine with a coupling for transmitting pressure fluid to a rotatable member.

## Abstract
A bobbin revolver for winding textile filaments has a rota table chuck carrier 12 with a plurality of bobbin chucks 16A, 16B . The carrier is rotatable on a central shaft 14 to urge the chucks successively towards a friction drive drum 18 which rotates bobbins on the chucks 16A, 16B to wind filament packages thereon. A fluid coupling, comprising co axial, rela tively rotable parts 30, 34 , having communicating passages therethrough, is provided around the shaft to pass pressure fluid to and or from devices on the carrier 12 . The fluid cou ping is arranged so that there is no relative rotation of its parts during winding of a package, thereby avoiding disturbances of the contact pressure between a package and the friction drum 18 through sliding friction between the coupling parts.
