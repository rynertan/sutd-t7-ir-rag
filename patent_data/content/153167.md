## Description
The present invention relates to a method of enhancing a radiation image, particularly a radiation image recorded on intensifying screens by exposure to radiation, particularly X rays. This process is particularly useful in non destructive testing such as industrial x rays, diagnostic imaging for medical purposes, and the like. The process is used with phosphors that store energy from incident radiation and release a different type or wavelength of radiation when stimulated. The process of the present invention enhances the image released upon stimulation of the excited phosphors. Recorded images are spatial, normally planar, representations of either spatially or temporally variable original signals. A large proportion of such recordings, such as copies of documents and pictures, represent a one to one relationship with an original document or scene, frequently with magnification or reduction involved. Radiographic film images in medicine represent a class of images where the original is not visible to the human eye and must be formed by a combination of invisible radiation e.g. x rays and a suitable transducer fluorescent screen . In all image forming systems, degradation of the original information occurs which normally manifests itself in two forms 1 blurring of edges reduced resolution, lower sharpness and 2 random irregularities noise, fog . In normal photographic images it has long been known that edge sharpness can be enhanced and noise reduced by masking the original with a negative unsharp mask of suitable contrast usually lower than that of the original . Early work representative of this photographic masking approach includes U.S. 2,407,211, U.S. 2,420,636, and U.S. 2,455,849 and more complex approaches are represented by U.S. 3,615,433. An early attempt to use a raster scan of the image while measuring the instantaneous light values photoelectrically and attenuating the beam according to a predetermined relationship with the light value is disclosed by U.S. 3,011,395. The rapid development of the space program lead to the emergence of high efficiency digital means of analyzing, reconstituting and enhancing images. Median filtering as a means of enhancing edge contrast has also been studied e.g. B. R. Frieden JOSA The concept of varying parameters similar to a and b throughout the scan of the image based on certain local properties of the image has been studied and these patents U.S. 4,315,318 and U.S. 4,317,179 and U.S. 4,346,409 have disclosed particular relationships between the parameters and the values of D The invention is a method as defined in the accompanying independent method claim 1 and concerns an adaptive edge and contrast enhancement technique for images, particularly for radiographs based on modified unsharp masking treatments. The invention is also as defined in the accompanying independent claim 11 to an apparatus for carrying out the method of the present invention. This filtering technique is based on a sliding window which moves across the image in both vertical and horizontal directions. At each step the density value of the center pixel in the window is transformed to a new value via a filtering equation of the same form as that reported above from Amtey et al and Wilson et al, namely The improvement is that whereas previously a b were constant for the given feature or at best were varied over the picture as a function of the values of D The relation between the size of the sliding window, the degree of enhancement, and the stability of the filter are shown in applications concerning visualization of digital angiograms and chest radiographs. Although the examples presented here are primarily concerned with medical radiographs for which the technique is eminently suitable, other types of images may also be treated. The technique is most suitable for stored images like photographs, printed images, magnetic tape or disk records, optical disk records, etc. in which the important noise experienced originates from the static noise frozen into the record rather than the dynamic noise originating from the reproduction system. It is therefore less suitable for real time video displays in which the dynamic noise often predominates. There does indeed exist considerable art addressed to the latter problem. In addition to the above mentioned imaging techniques and systems, the process and apparatus of the invention may be used with lapid systems. These are systems and methods for establishing an electrostatic charge image and a readout of the image which includes the use of a multilayered photoconductive device, a D.C. voltage source connected across the device to provide a high electric field across the device while a radiation source is used to expose the device to a radiation image to produce an electrostatic image at a layer of the device and a scanner for scanning the device with readout radiation while readout electronics and the D.C. voltage source are connected in series across the device. For example, the device may include a first conductive layer, an insulative layer a photoconductive insulative layer and a second conductive layer in that order wherein the successive layers are contiguous when the system uses light or x rays to provide a radiation image. The use of the D.C. voltage source during readout provides a source to support the charge flow that is initiated by the readout radiation directed to a portion of the device. Such charge flow is detected by the readout electronics, since it is in series with the D.C. voltage source. The pixel size chosen will of course vary with the type of image involved. In particular images with high information density will require small pixels whereas larger pixels may be acceptable for lower information densities. The Figure shows a flow chart for the operation of the process of the present invention. The hardware and software configuration for the operation of the process of this invention for a three by three window is shown by way of a flow chart in the Figure. A line scan of the three rows of three pixels is shown by number Due to the wide dynamic range of attenuation values in electronically scanned images, digital image processing is often used to reduce suppress the low frequency content of information. Psychophysical experiments have also indicated that an image with accentuated edges is often more subjectively pleasing for viewing since it can increase the visual perception. One method that has been used widely in applications regarding visualization of computed radiographic image for medical diagnostics is the technique of unsharp masking. In this process the image is scanned by two overlapping apertures, one at normal resolution The low resolution image can be considered as a low pass filter or an integrator and the normal resolution approximately as an all pass filter. Subtraction of the above terms would form a modified high pass filter which then can be referred to as an unsharp mask filter. Various degrees of enhancement can be achieved by adjusting the parameter C. The greater the absolute values for C, the greater the image contrast and edge enhancement that can be accomplished. At the same time, however, image noise will also be enhanced. Such systems have been disclosed in the art but only with C a constant for a given image or with C varied as a function of X or This algorithm is applied to pixels selected by a sliding window, which moves across the image in both vertical and horizontal directions. The size of the window may be as small as 5 pixels 3x3 with no corners , up to a very large number. The larger the number, the greater the potential for elimination of useful detail. A useful limit of a 15x15 pixel window 225 pixels is workable, with 5 100 pixels as a preferred limit. More preferred would be ranges of 5 81 and 5 64 pixels per window. At each step the center pixel density D This modification then keeps the histogram from compressing and also prevents the filter equation from being negative. Equation 2.3 can be easily represented as The greater the absolute value for k, the more emphasis on edges that can be obtained high pass spatial filtering however, at the same time high spatial frequency image noise will also be increased. In the algorithm that we disclose here, we make the coefficient k adaptive to change in the image scene. Where an edge is crossed, emphasis is desired large coefficient k to perform the image edge and contrast enhancement. In areas where there are no edges the emphasis coefficient is kept to a low level to minimize noise. As a result, edge and contrast enhancement are applied only to the area of an image where there are edges. In the disclosures of U.S. 4,315,318 and 4,317,179 the emphasis coefficient is controlled by D In this invention the emphasis coefficient k is controlled with a statistical parameter associated with the window at any given position. In particular the standard deviation σ of the pixel values within the window is used to produce a function f σ which varies monotonically with σ but has upper and lower bounds which are suited to the control of k as will be explained below. When k is controlled in such a fashion two advantages over the prior art are obtained A broad range of function f σ may be used within the confines of their being monotonic in σ and having upper and lower bounds which can be chosen at will. We have found a particularly advantageous relation to be the inverse exponential function If we set t 0.1 the effective range of σ over which k operates is 0.1 σ 10, for t 1.0 we have 1 σ 100 and for The lower bound of k arises from σ 0 when k 1 r and the upper bound when σ S when In work on radiographs the use of r 1.0, S 0.9 gives very valuable results. With the radiograph image generated electronically with 256 levels of gray the best range value was found to be t 1.0. The function f σ may be of other exponential forms or other forms which may be expressed in exponential form, e.g., hyperbolic functions, sine function, etc. The above mentioned adaptive algorithm was tested on several images with variable odd window sizes from 3x3 to 9x9 to 25x25, and compared them with the non adaptive case unsharp masking . Analysis and testing were performed on several aspects of the algorithm. First, the effect of size of the window vs. the 2nd order statistics standard deviation of the window were examined. It was found that as the window size increases, the standard deviation flattens out. As a result, this corresponded also to a lower coefficient setting for the adaptive filter. The next test was to compare the noise suppression of this adaptive algorithm with the non adaptive case. The density of picture element vs. their position in one line of an angiogram image was examined. An edge crossing vein between pixel position 15 and 20 was noted. When the unsharp masking was applied with emphasis on the coefficient of c 0.85, that the noise in the image is enhanced. With adpative algorithm of the invention, the edges are enhanced, but not the noise in the background. The effect of various window sizes vs. the contrast of the image was also examined. As the size of the window increased, the degrees magnitude of contrasts edge enhancement also got higher. In order to clearly demonstrate the advantage of this algorithm for noise reduction, a set of test target grids were used. The test images were taken using 3M Trimax film and were digitized using a laser scanner. Sample radiographs attached show the comparison of edge enhancement and noise reduction of the adaptive and non adaptive algorithms. The method of Example 2 was applied to a set of chest radiographs and equivalent results are shown in the equivalent radiographs. Shown below is an actual computer program in FORTRAN limited to a 25x25 pixel window image enhancement process according to the present invention. The program was run in a Digital Equipment Corporation VAX 11 750 computer. A flow chart of the program is shown in the Figure.
