# A direction converting device for a toy car.

## Abstract
A direction converting device for a toy car is disclosed, in which the toy car is provided with an electromagnet 22 hav ing an exciting iron core 24 with its opposite sides being ener gizable to different polarities and a magnet 20 having oppo site end faces with different polarities, in which one core por tion of the electromagnet 22 at its free end has a width equal to or larger than a width of the opposed end of the magnet 20 , and in which the electromagnet 22 or the magnet 20 is fixed to one end of a controlling element 18 which in turn is ar ranged at a middle portion of a steering element 14 . The one core portion of the electromagnet 22 may be divided into two portions, between which is arranged another magnet 28 . Thus, the device ensures a neutral position of the steering element 14 reliably in the deenergized state of the electro magnet 22 .
