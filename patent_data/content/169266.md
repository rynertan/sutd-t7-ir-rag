# Improved positron emission tomography camera.

## Abstract
A position emission tomography camera having a plurality of detector rings positioned side by side or offset by one half of the detector cross section around a patient area to detect radiation therefrom. Each ring contains a plurality of scintillation detectors which are positioned around an inner circumference with a septum ring extending inwardly from the inner circumference along each outer edge of each ring. An additional septum ring is positioned in the middle of each ring of detectors and parallel to the other septa rings whereby the inward extent of all the septa rings may be reduced by one half and the number of detectors required in each ring is reduced. Each detector ring or offset ring includes a plurality of photomultiplier tubes and a plurality of scintillation crystals are positioned relative to the photo multiplier tubes whereby each tube is responsive to more than one crystal. Each alternate crystal in the ring is offset by one half or less of the thickness of the crystal such that the staggered crystals are seen by more than one photomulti plier tube. This sharing of crystals and photomultiplier tubes allows identification of the staggered crystals and the use of smaller detectors shared by larger photomultiplier tubes thereby requiring less photomultiplier tubes, creating more scanning slices, providing better data sampling, and reduc ing the cost of the camera. The offset detector ring geometry combined with the additional septa reduces the cost of the positron camera and improves its performance.
