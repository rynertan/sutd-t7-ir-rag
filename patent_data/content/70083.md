# Computing apparatus and method of processing message packets.

## Abstract
The apparatus, networks, systems and method of the present invention are predicated upon the following concept. A multiprocessor system intercouples the processors 14, 16, 18 23 with an active logic network 50a having a plurality of priority determining nodes. Messages applied concurrently to the network 50a in groups are sorted, using the data content of the messages, to a single or common priority message which is distributed to all the processors 14, 16, 18 23 with a predetermined total network delay time. Losing messages are again retired concurrently in groups at a later time. Message routing is determined by local acceptance or rejection of messages at the processors 14, 16, 18 23 , based upon destination data in the messages. All messages occupy places in a coherent priority scheme and are transferred in contending groups with prioritisation on the network 50a . Using data, status, control and response messages, and different multiprocessor modes, the system is particularly suited for configuration in a relational data base machine having capability for maintaining an extended data base and handling complex queries.
