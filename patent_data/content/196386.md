# PORTABLE CONTAINER AND FUNNEL

## Abstract
A portable, vented container 10 particularly for dirty oil, having a small fill spout 46 and a vent opening 58 is used in conjunction with a funnel 28 . A vent closure member 36 and a funnel securing latch 40 are integral with the funnel 28 so that when the funnel 28 is inverted and positioned in surmounting relation to the container 10 , the vent closure member 36 closes the vent 58 and the securing latch 40 is engaged by a fill spout capt 44 which engagement secures the funnel against movement and hence maintains the closure of the vent 58 as well. Removal of the fill spout cap 44 releases the funnel 10 , and positioning the funnel 10 into its operative position relative to an automotive oil drain plug separates the vent closure member 36 of the funnel 10 from the vent 58 . An elongate extension member 70 having a flexible medial portion is further provided.
