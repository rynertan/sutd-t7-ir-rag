# COOLED ROLLER FOR THE CONTINUOUS CASTING OF FLAT BARS

## Abstract
A roller R for the continuous casting of metallic flat bars or plates S , having a high solidification factor, a satisfactory life of the cylindrical cooling mantle 4 and ease of substi tuting same. The mantle 4 is formed by a thin metallic, normally copper cylinder, cooled by means of water flowing at high speed through conduits 41 formed beneath the in ternal surface of said mantle, means 12 11 being provided for feeding each conduit independently from the others. The mantle 4 is sustained by a central pivot 1 , and is kept firmly into shape by filling with a suitable material, as for instance a mixture of sand and cement 303 , the annular chamber 3 between the mantle 4 and the central pivot 1 . The water cooling of the mantle may be only limited to the contact zone between liquid metal and mantle 4 , or may be extended to the whole surface of the mantle.
