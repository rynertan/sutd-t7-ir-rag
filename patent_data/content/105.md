# Roller assembly primarily for a chain conveyor and a chain conveyor including such a roller assembly.

## Abstract
A roller assembly primarily intended for chain conveyors comprising a roller 26 journalled for rotation on a bushing 36 , the roller being sealed against ingress of foreign matter by at least one labyrith seal, said seal comprising a pair of overlapping rings 46,56 received in a counterbore 42 in one end face of the roller, one ring 46 being fitted to the bushing and the other 56 to the roller, whereby passage of grease through the seal is restricted to a tortuous path formed by said overlapping rings. In use, the inner ring 46 provides an axial thrust bearing surface 101 for the roller. The rings are preferably L shaped in cross section and are suitable for use with rollers of metal or plastics material.
