# Acoustic microscope.

## Abstract
An acoustic microscope comprising an acoustic trans ducer 140 which performs both generation and detection of acoustic wave beams, and a sample holding member 82 which opposes to an acoustic wave transmitting and receiv ing surface of the transducer 140 , to hold an object sample 62 through an acoustic wave propagating medium 8 and to offer behind the sample a layer of an acoustic impedance unequal to that of the sample, so that the sample holding member 82 is moved in parallel, thereby to detect acoustic waves reflected from front and rear surfaces of the sample 62 and acoustic waves reflected from a surface of the sample holding member 82 without reaching the sample and to measure amplitudes and returning periods of time of the reflected acoustic waves, so as to measure the velocity of sound through the sample of unknown thickness, the acoustic impedance of the sample, etc. from the measured values.
