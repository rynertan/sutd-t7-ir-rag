# TRI LEVEL INPUT BUFFER

## Abstract
A simple six transistor input buffer for generating and applying binary function test signals to associated circuitry in an integrated circuit package. The buffer recognizes three different voltage levels of an input signal that is applied to a single input test pin and generates three corresponding binary output signals that may be used for testing various functions of the associated circuitry.
