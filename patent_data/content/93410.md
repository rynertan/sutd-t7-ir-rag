# APPARATUS FOR SENSING A MAGNETIC STRIPE ON A RECORDING MEDIA

## Abstract
An apparatus for sensing a magnetic stripe 21 disposed on a card 20 which is inserted in the apparatus in a direction A perpendicular to the stripe 21 includes a magnetic head 29 , a head supporting member 33 for supporting the head for movement having a component in parallel with the stripe, and a mechanism 30 36 for driving the head supporting member in response to the insertion of the card so as to move the head along the stripe of the moving card, whereby the stripe of the card which is inserted into the apparatus in a direction perpendicular A to the stripe is sensed by the head.
