## Description
INSECTICIDAL COMPOSITION This invention relates to insecticidal conpositions, a process fcr the preparation thereof, 2 method controlling insects and a method for the photostabilization of pyrethroid compounds. According to an aspect of the present invention there are provided insecticidal compositions of a prolonged duration of effect comprising as active ingredient at least one pyrethroid compound and optionally further active ingredient s and additive s . The characteristic feature of the said compositions is that they comprise as photostabilizer or synergistic promoting component, a benzoic acid derivative of the general formula IEMI1.1 e.g. in an amount of 0.01 10 parts by weight per part by weight of the pyrethroid compound S . In the general formula IR is hydrogen, C1 20 alkyl, C2 8 alkenyl, or a group of the general formula CH2 nO mH in which is an integer of 2 to 4 or a group of the general formula 1 EMI2.1 wherein n is an integer of 0 to 6 andX and Y are hydrogen, halogen, nitro or C1 4 alkyl. The term pyretnroid compound used throughout the specfication relates to natural or synthetic optionally substituted dimethyl cyclopropane carboxylic acid esters and compounds of the fenvalerate type. It is known that the field of application of insecticidal agents comprising various pyrethroids is sgnficantly limited by the restricted duration of activity of the said compositions. This is due to the fact that although pyrethroid co ponds are very stable under the exclusion of light, in trè presence of light their decomposition takes place very rapidly and consequently the insecticidal activity of the composition is lost promptly after use. This disadvantageous property is responsible for the limited use of the earlier synthesized members of the pyrethroid. group bioresmethrin, tetramethrin etc. in agrculture for the killing of insect pests. The said active ingredients are used particularly in compositions used against sanitary insect pests when prompt acts. is required e.g. aerosols and when the duration or the effect is not a primary requirement. The photodegradation.of pyrethroids is to some extent suppressed by the shadowing effect of the carriers present in the compositions in suspension form. This effect is only slight however in the case Of emulsifiable concentrates generally used in agriculture for their other advantageous properties. Efforts were riade to increase the photostability of pyrethroids by using these active ingredients in microencapsulated form Pest control 47, 6 , 1 2O, 1979 7. The drawback of this method is that it made the compositions so expensive that they can be only used for sanitary purposes. The photodegradation of the so called second generation pyrethroids e.g. permethrin, deltamethrin.fenvalerate, cypermethrin etc. is also considerable.Permethrin the most important representative of the so called photostable pyrethroid group loses its activity e.g. in tests on various specimens about twice as rapidly if illuminated by 600 lux than if stored in the dark Permethrin, The Wellcome Foundation, 1975 . According to prior art various stabilizers were used in pyrethroidal compositions but they failed to achieve the desir result US Patents Nos. 3.893.561 and 4.056.610 Japanese patent application KOKAI No. 73.98023 and Pyrethrum Post 11, 135 1972 7. 7ne composition of tt present invention preserves its insecticidal activity after use for a significantly longer period of time than the composition comprising no additive of the present invention. It has been found that the duration of effect of the composition of the present invention surpasses that of the known compositions comprising no such additive only under natural illumination. If the samples are compared in the dark no difference is observed. This indicates that the stabilizers of the present invention decrease ane inhibit the photodegradation of the pyrethroid active ingredient. The above is illustrated by the following data Several benzoic acid derivatives of the general formula I are dissolved in methyl ethyl ketone and solutions are prepared which correspond to a pyrethroid stabilizer weight ratio of 25 1, 5 1 and 1 1 and which contain no stabilizer, respectively. Four roughenedPetri dishes are impregnated with each sample. After the evaporation of the solvent two of the four Petri dishes are kept until the beginning of the test in the dark and the remaining two Petri dishes are exposed to the light of a mercury vapour lamp RGO 125 the time of illumination depends on the pyrethroid used.The spectrum of the light source used is qualitatively identical with that of sunlight, but it is more active from the point of view of photodegradation, the ratio of ultraviolet radiation having a higher wave length being higher. Thus the mercury vapour lamp used allows accelerated photostability testing. Twenty female domestic flies Musca domestica are placed under the plastic lid of each Petri dish on glass slides either kept in the dark or illuminated and the number of the killed flies is re off for twc, hours every minute. The LT50 values time required to kill 50 of the fly population is calculated from the mortality data of two parallel tests with the aid of the probit transfornation method. The shorter periods of time correspond to a higher active ingredient concentration on the slide. In order to carry out the comparison under proper conditions, the LT50 should be a still measurable value even on the exposed samples comprising no stabilizer it is also necessary to test active ingredients of completely different photostability. For this reason the time of photoexposure of the sample is varied depending on the character of the pyrethroid so that on slides comprising no stabilizer the photodegradation should inactivate only about 95.0 99.5 of the active ingredient. The tests are carried out on series of slides impregnated with two different pyrethroid concentrations. The LTso values measured on slides impregnated with various pyrethroids and mixtures of pyrethroids and ethylene glycol inono salicylate, respectively, are determined at a pyrethroid concentration of 140 ug cm2 Table 1 and 28 ug cm2 Table 2 . The photostability data of mixture of benzyl salicylate and tetramethrin are summarized in Table 3 concentration 140 and 28 g cm2 .The photostability data of mixtures of tetramethrin and phenyl salicylate are disclosed in Table 4, while those of mixtures of tetramethrin and cis hexenyl salicylate in able 5. It appears from the said Tables that on comparing the LT data obtained on samples kept in the dark on the one hand and exposed to illumination on the other, the increase of the benzoic acid derivative content results in a decrease of the saic difference. On samples exposed to illumination light a difference can be detected between the Lt50 value of a sample containing no stabilizer and that of the sample containing the lowest amount of the stabilizer. This difference becomes larger as the stabilizer content is increased. This clearly proves that the light decomposes an increasingly smaller ratio of the active ingredient. It has also been found that in addition to the inhibition of the photodegradation of the active ingredient, the stabilizer of the present invention also increases the insecticidal activity. This manifests itself in the increase of the toxic effect which is particularly important against store room pests killed with aerosols. Thus if cockroaches or flies are not immidiately killed they can fall during their struggle e.g. into the food and iray thus cause infection moth flies can lay eggs quite shortly before their death. .As the pyrethroid component non photostable or relatively photostable pyrethroids can both be used.It is preferred to use as pyrethroidal active ingredient 0.01 90 8 e.g. 0.05 50 t by weight of tetramethrin and or permethrin and or cypermethrin and or bioresmethrin or .8 combination of more than one of the said components. Other pyrethroids which may be used are phenothrin, deltamethrin and fenvalerate. As photostabilizer or synergistic component promoter , a wide range of the compounds of the general formula I can be used. Thus it is preferred to use a C1 12 e.g. C1 4 alkyl ester, 2 C2 4 alkyl diol ester, the phenyl and or benzyl ester of salicylic acid or a mixture thereof. The most suitable stabilizer can be chosen according to the pyrethroid and other additives used and the method of application. Preferred representatives of the compounds of the general formula I are the following derivatives cis hexenyl salicylate, ethylene glycol monosalicylate, chloro salicylic acid, phenyl salicylate, benzyl salicylate, methyl salicylate, acryl salicylate, dodecyl salicylate, triethylene glycol monosalicylate. The compound of formula CI is preferably used in an amount of 0.02 6 Ce.g. 0.04 5 parts by weight per part by weight of the pyrethroid compound Cs . According to the present invention there are also provided compositions comprising in addition to the pyrethroidal active ingredient one or more acaricidal and or fungicidal and or further insecticidal ingredient s Zt is advantageous to combine the pyrethroid with an insecticidal active ingredient cf another type in order to delay resistance, broaden the activity speclrur. and prolong the effect. The use of fungicidal or acaracidal agents in addition to the insecticidal components provides complex protection and thus the control of pests can be carried out in a single operation step. As insecticidal active ingredient it is preferred to use 0.01 6 parts by weight of an organic phosphoric acid ester preferably propetamphos and or bromophos and or DDVP per part by weight of the pyrethroid. Together with the said insecticidal component or per se 0.01 6 parts by weight of a carbamate derivative per part by weight of the pyrethroid can be added. For this purpose propoxur, bendiocarb or dimethylan can for example be used. As acaracidal agent, oxamyl and or malathion are preferably used, in an amount of 0.Ol 6.parts by weight per part by weight of the pyrethroid. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the fungicidal ingredient may be one which exhibits its fungicidal effect on fungi appearing at the time of insecticidal pyrethroidal treatment and thus provide complex protection, For this purpose benzimidazole derivatives are preferably used, particularly 0.1 10 parts by weight of carbomethoxy benzimidazole or benomyl. Together with these compounds, tor per se ephosite aluminium or other fungicides can also be used. The appropriate fungicide may be selected, according to whether the pyrethroid treatment is carried out for the disinfection of stables or for sanitary purposes. The compositions may contain in addition to the above components further additives and or auxiliary agents such as carriers, diluents and surface active agents. Suitable auxiliary agents are selected on the basis of the character of the composition. In the case of ready for use liquid insecticidal compositions it is not always necessary to add an auxiliary agent. Thus cereals can be treated against corn weevil with a solution of the pyrethroid in an ortho benzoic acid ester. In UL t compositics it is preferred to use an inert liquid diluent in order to provide accurate dosage. Emulsifiable concentrates may contain an inert carrier e.g. xylene, mineral oil fractions etc, and preferably an emulsifier. For this purpose surfactant mixtures e.g. Atlox 4873 Atlox 1045 atlas Chem. Ind. 7 can be used. Suspendable concentrates may comprise a solid carrier e.g. China clay and a wetting agent Ce.g. Renex 648, product of Atlas Chem. Ind. and a dispersing agent e.g. Tamol manufactured by N. Rohtr and Haas GmbH . Coatings or varnishes. e.g. various insecticidal lacquers may comprise a liquid diluent Ge.g. xylene and a film forming polymer e.g. polyvinyl acetate . The aerosols may comprise a suitable liquid diluent e.g. an aliphatic alcohol, methylene chloride, mineral oil fractions, water , a propellant e.g. Freon, propane but ne, carbon dioxide , Water based aerosols may comprise an emulsifier e.g. Atlox 8916P, manufactured by AtlasChef. Ind. as well. The dusting powders may comprise a mineral carrier e.g. talc , and a deactivator to improve the chemical stability of the active ingredient e.g. hexamethylene tetramine . Tr. t compositions may Ise contain depending on the character thereof ir. a concentration lower than the usual value further synergists e.g. piperonyl butoxide , further sterilizers e.g. epichlorohydrin , antioxidants e.g. butyl hydroxy toluene, methyl hydroxy anisole .The latter components may also increase the synergistic effect of the benzoic acid derivative of the general formula I. The physical or chemical aetails and the mechanisn of the photostabilising effect of the benzoic acid derivatives of the general formula I are not exactly known.It is possible that the compounds of the general formula I protect the active ingredient by light adsorption. It can be also be presumed that the compounds of the general formula I inhibit by their own light absorption the formation of photolysis products decomposing the pyrethroid molecule fro the substances absorbed from the air on the toxic area or aerosol particles formed from the compositions e.g. vapour, carbon dioxide . Since the benzoic acid derivatives can exhibit their photodegradation inhibiting effect even at a very low concentration it is most likely that the compounds of the general formula I promptly react with the substances absorbed in the composition which are responsible for the rapid degradation of the active ingredient e.g. water, carbon dioxide, oxygen etc. , bind the said substances and thus exert a protecting effect. As already mentioned above the benzoic acid aerivatives of the general formula I exhitit a favourable effect on the biological activity of pyrethroids and particularly improve the toxic effect. According to our presumption the said synergistic effect may be due to the fact that the compounds of the general formula I make the chitin cover of the insects more permeable and inhibit the enzymes playing an important role in detoxification. According to a further feature of the present invention there is provided an insecticidal treatment carrier out by using compositions comprising a pyrethroid derivative stabilized and synergized with a benzoic acid derivative of the general formula I. The said treatment can be carried out by usual and conventional methods. Thus the composition can be applied on the plants and can be used directly against stationary insects or against flying insects The advantage of the present invention is that it increases the stability of the potent pyrethroids and thus enables the more widespread use thereof. This facilitates the organization of work as well. The compounds of the general formula I are known Ullmann Enzykl. derTechn. Chemie XIII. page 80 .
