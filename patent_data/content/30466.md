# A device for preventing overwinding of a roller blind.

## Abstract
In one embodiment a slip coupling is incorporated as part of a bracket 12 for supporting one end of the roller 1 . The bracket 12 has a cylindrical bearing 15 which is rotatable within a circular aperture 16 in the face of the bracket 12 and receives a pin 5 of a spindle 4 of the roller so as to be rotatable therewith. The bearing 15 carries a spring 20 the ends of which engage with stops 30 on the face of the brack et 12 so that the bearing 15 is prevented from rotation when the torque exerted by the motor spring 7 is below a predeter mined level. When the motor spring 7 is overwound the ends of the springs 20 are caused to flex to override the stops 30 and so reduce the tension in the motor spring 7 . In a second embodiment the slip coupling is located within the roller 1 .
