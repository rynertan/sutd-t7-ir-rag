# Improved multi purpose zone controlled blast furnace and method of producing hot metal, gasses and slags.

## Abstract
The improved multi purpose zone controlled blast furnace and method of producing hot metal, gases and slags relates to the functioning of a blast furnace as a high capacity hot metal or reducing gas producing unit. Methods are known for reducing solution loss by injecting reducing gas into a blast furnace, and for generating reducing gas from low cost material. However, the effectiveness of these methods is reduced by solution loss and excessive costs. The present invention overcomes these deficiencies by producing a reducing gas substantially free of CO₂ and H₂O in a blast furnace from low cost materials and intro ducing such reducing gas substantially free of CO₂ and H₂O into the side of a blast furnace to substantially avoid so lution loss .
