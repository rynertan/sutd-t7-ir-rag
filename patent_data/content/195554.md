# Spacecraft with articulated solar array and method for array deployment.

## Abstract
A spacecraft is disclosed which comprises a spacecraft body, at least one solar array 44, extendible outwardly from the spacecraft body, and articulation means 80, 82, 84 for adjusting the position of the solar array 44, relative to the spacecraft body independently about three axes, each of which is orthogonal to the axis adjacent to it. Each articula tion means comprises a first rotatable coupling 80 for permitting rotation of the solar array 44, about a first axis substantially parallel to the surface of the spacecraft body, a second rotatable coupling 82 for permitting rotation of the solar array about a second axis normal to the first axis, and a third rotatable coupling 84 for permitting rotation of the solar array about a third axis normal to the second axis and parallel to the longitudinal axis of the array.
