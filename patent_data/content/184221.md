## Description
The present invention relates to a hierarchical data transmission systems in which a plurality of data trains are multiplexed and transmitted from a transmitter side thereof and the thus transmitted data trains are received at a receiver side thereof and demultiplexed therein to reproduce the original data trains, and to methods of operating such systems. EP A 0 114 702 discloses a hierarchical data transmission system comprising a transmitter side for providing a plurality of data trains, each composed of a main data signal and a sub data signal a receiver side for reception of the multiplexed data train and reproduction of the original transmission data trains and, a transmission line connected there between, wherein Another similar system is known from EP A 0 007 524. A hierarchical data transmission system basically comprises a side for dealing with data of a low order group and a side for dealing with data of a high order group. The high order group of data is produced by summing at least two low order groups of data, so that the high order group of data provides a very high transmission rate, and accordingly, the high order group contains a great amount of data. Specifically, a hierarchical data transmission system is known in which, for example, first and second 9 channel data trains, each having a transmission rate of 45 Mb s, are multiplexed to obtain another data train having a transmission rate of 405 Mb s. Further, recently an optical signal has been used to realize a very high transmission rate, i.e., a great amount of transmission data. In such an optical transmission system, it is preferable to further multiplex, for example, two of the aforesaid data trains having a transmission rate of 405 Mb s, to obtain another data train which has a transmission rate as high as 810 Mb s 405 405 . In the prior art multiplex system, the above mentioned multiplexing is achieved as follows. The first 9 channel data trains, each having the transmission rate of 45 Mb s, are multiplexed on the transmitter side by a first pre group multiplexer to obtain a first pre group data train having a transmission rate of 405 Mb s, and simultaneously, the second 9 channel data trains, each having the transmission rate of 45 Mb s, are multiplexed by a second pre group multiplexer to obtain a second pre group data train having a transmission rate of 405 Mb s. Then the first and second pre group data trains, having a transmission rate of 405 Mb s are again multiplexed by a main group multiplexer to obtain an output data train to be transmitted this output data train having the transmission rate of 810 Mb s. The output data train is then received at a receiver side, which is comprised of a main group demultiplexer and first and second pre group demultiplexers. In the receiver side, the received input data train having a transmission rate of 810 Mb s is first demultiplexed by the main group demultiplexer to produce a first pre group data train and a second pre group data train and the two data trains are then respectively applied to the first and second pre group demultiplexers to obtain the original first and second 9 channel data trains. Thus, the prior art main group multiplexer and main group demultiplexer must operate at a very high operation speed, i.e., 810 Mb s. Further, the main group multiplexer of the transmission side must achieve a particular processing therein, such as a known stuffing synchronization, whereby the multiplexer necessarily becomes complicated in construction and has a high cost. Similarly, the main group demultiplexer at the receiver side is also required to further achieve a known destuffing synchronization, conforming to the above mentioned stuffing in the transmitter side, whereby the demultiplexer also necessarily becomes complicated in construction and has a high cost. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a hierarchical data transmission system having a construction comprising simplified main group multiplexing and demultiplexing units but retaining the function of distinguishing one pre group data train from another pre group data train. This simple construction should enable the main group multiplexing and demultiplexing units to be manufactured at a low cost. According to one aspect of the invention, the transmission system initially defined is characterized in that According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a hierarchical data transmission system comprising, at least, a transmitter side for providing a plurality of data trains, each composed of a main data signal and a sub data signal a receiver side for reception of the multiplexed data train and reproduction of the original transmission data trains and, a transmission line connected therebetween, According to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of operating a hierarchical data transmission system comprising, at least, a transmitter side for providing a plurality of data trains, each composed of a main data signal and a sub data signal a receiver side for reception of the multiplexed data train and reproduction of the original transmission data trains and, a transmission line connected therebetween, the method comprising the following steps According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of operating a hierarchical data transmission system comprising, at least, a transmitter side for providing a plurality of data trains, each composed of a main data signal and a sub data signal a receiver side for reception of the multiplexed data train and reproduction of the original transmission data trains and, a transmission line connected therebetween, the method comprising the following steps The present invention will be more apparent from the ensuing description with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein Before describing the embodiments of the present invention, the related art and the disadvantages therein will be described with reference to the related figure. Figure 1 illustrates a conventional hierarchical data transmission system. In Fig. 1, the main part of the transmission system comprises a transmitter side, a receiver side, and a transmission line 9 distributed therebetween. The transmitter side is comprised of a first pre group multiplexer MUX1 1, a second pre group multiplexer MUX2 2, a main group multiplexer MUX 3, and an interface unit INF 4. The receiver side is comprised of an interface unit INF 5, a main group demultiplexer DMUX 6, a first pre group demultiplexer DMUX1 7, and a second pre group demultiplexer DMUX2 8. In the transmitter side, the data trains I and II are, for example, 9 channel data trains. Only two data trains are shown in the drawing, but three or more data trains may be handled, if necessary. Each data train has a transmission rate of, for example, 45 Mb s. The 9 channels CH1 CH9 of the first data train I are multiplexed in the first pre group multiplexer MUX1 1, to obtain a first pre group data train D1 having a transmission rate of 405 45 x 9 Mb s. Similarly 9 channels CH1 CH9 of the second data train II are multiplexed in the second pre group multiplexer MUX2 to obtain a second pre group data train D2 having a transmission rate of 405 45 x 9 Mb s. Where the data transmission system uses optical data transmission, the system can transfer a great amount of data. To this end, it is possible to further multiplex the two pre group data trains D1 and D2 to obtain a main group data train. According to a conventional method, the pre group data trains D1 and D2 are multiplexed in the transmission side by a main group multiplexer MUX 3, to produce a main group data train D12 having a transmission rate of 810 Mb s. The train D12 is then input, via the interface unit INF 4, to the transmission line 9, as the output data train to be transmitted. Note, in the optical system concerned, the interface unit 4 operates, as an electro optic converter, to enable it to be coupled with the related optical fiber, i.e., the transmission line 9. Alternatively, if a known coaxial cable is used as the transmission line 9, the interface unit 4 operates as a unipolar bipolar converter. In the receiver side of the data transmission system, the received input data train is applied to the interface unit INF 5, which operates in reverse to the transmitter side interface unit 4. That is, the unit 5 carries out an opto electric conversion or a bipolar unipolar conversion. The thus converted electric signal of 810 Mb s is then supplied, as the received main group data train D 12, to the main group demultiplexer DMUX 6, and the train D 12 is then demultiplexed to produce the first pre group data train D 1 and the second pre group data train D 2, each having a transmission rate of 405 Mb s. The pre group data trains D 1 and D 2 are further demultiplexed, respectively, by the first and second pre group demultiplexers DMUX1, DMUX2 7 and 8, and accordingly, the original channels of both the first and second data trains I and II are reproduced. Thus, the transmitter side of a hierarchical transmission system can comprise a multiple stage connection of the multiplexers 1, 2, and 3, and the receiver side can comprise a multiple stage connection of the demultiplexers 6, 7, and 8. This system is disclosed in, for example, However, the conventional hierarchical data transmission system produces the previously mentioned problem, which will be clarified below. The pre group multiplexers 1 and 2 are provided with respective oscillators not shown in Fig. 1 , each oscillator generating a clock signal of 405 MHz. The main group multiplexer 3 is also provided with a respective oscillator not shown in Fig. 1 generating a clock signal of 810 MHz. This allows these units to plan individual roles, i.e., multiplexing and demultiplexing. In the multiplexing process of the transmitter, it is important to minimize any phase deviation between the first and second data trains I and II having a transmission rate of 45 Mb s. One of the techniques for minimizing the phase deviation is known as stuffing synchronization . When stuffing synchronization is performed in each of the first and second pre group multiplexers 1 and 2, the following stage multiplexer 3 must operate at a very high operation speed. This produces a disadvantage in that the main group multiplexer 3 must have a complicated construction, and accordingly, a high cost. On the other hand, in the main group demultiplexer 6 of the receiver side, a usual frame synchronization is achieved at an operation speed the same as that for the transmission, so that the received data train having a transmission rate of 810 Mb s is demultiplexed into the data trains D 1 and D 2, each having a transmission rate of 405 Mb s. Obviously, this means that the demultiplexer 6 concerned also must operate at a considerably high operation speed to achieve a destuffing synchronization that will cope with the above mentioned transmitter side stuffing synchronization. Therefore, the higher the transmission rate, the more complicated becomes the construction of the demultiplexer 6. Figure 2 illustrates a hierarchical data transmission system according to the present invention. In Fig. 2, components the same as those of Fig. 1 are represented by the same reference numerals or characters this also applies to all later figures. Therefore, only the components 21, 22, 23, 26, 27 and 28 are newly employed as compared with the system shown in Fig. 1. In the transmitter side, 23 represents a means for performing a parallel serial conversion and functionally identical to the prior art main group multiplexer MUX 3. Preferably the means 23 is a parallel serial converter. In the receiver side, 21 represents a first selector SEL1 and 22 a second selector SEL2 . Reference 26 represents a means for performing a serial parallel conversion and functionally identical to the prior art main group demultiplexer DMUX 6. The component 27 cooperates with the first pre group demultiplexer 7 and acts as a first discriminator DISC1 . Similarly, the component 28 cooperates with the second pre group demultiplexer 8 and acts as a second discriminator DISC2 . The discriminators 27 and 28 switch the selection states in the selectors 21 and 22 respectively. The multichannel data trains I, which are, for example, 9 channel data trains each having a transmission rate of 45 Mb s, are applied to the first pre group multiplexer 1 and multiplexed therein to produce the first pre group data train D1 having a transmission rate of 405 Mb s. Similarly, the multichannel data trains II, which are, for example, 9 channel data trains each having a transmission rate of 45 Mb s, are applied to the second pre group multiplexer 2 and multiplexed therein to produce the second pre group data train D2 having a transmission rate of 405 Mb s, as in the conventional system of Fig. 1. At this time, the previously mentioned stuffing synchronization is carried out in each of the multiplexers 1 and 2, thus obtaining the first and second pre group data trains D1 and D2 having a transmission rate of 405 Mb s. In this case, it is important to note that the first and second sub data signals FY1, FY2 in Fig. 2 are supplied to the first and second multiplexers 1 and 2, respectively, and multiplexed therein with respective main data signals. Generally, each of the pre group data trains is mainly composed of both a main data signal and a sub data signal. The main data signal transfers inherent main data information, such as voice signals, computer data, and so on. Conversely, the sub data signal transfers cooperative control information, such as a so called order wire signal, supervisory signal, fault indication signal, and so on. According to the present invention, the signal pattern of the first sub data signal to be multiplexed, together with the first main data signal, in the first data train D1 is, in advance, intentionally made different from the signal pattern of another signal, i.e., the second sub data signal to be multiplexed together with the second main data signal, in the second data train D2. The thus multiplexed first and second pre group data trains D1 and D2 having a transmission rate of 405 Mb s including the sub data signals are input to the parallel serial converter P S 23, wherein the two data trains D1 and D2 are further multiplexed. Since the two parallel data trains having a transmission rate of 405 Mb s are serialized by the P S converter 23, the resultant serial data train, i.e., a main group data train D12, assumes a transmission rate of 810 Mb s. The basic concept of the present invention resides in the above mentioned parallel serial conversion for realizing the identical function achieved by the conventional main group multiplexer 3. The main group data train D12 having a transmission rate of 810 Mb s is sent from the P S converter 23, via the interface unit INF 4, to the transmission line 9. In the transmitter side of the system, a clock signal of 810 MHz is supplied to the main group P S converter 23, i.e., a main group multiplexer. The clock signal is generated by a suitable oscillator, not shown in Fig. 2. Therefore, the related parallel serial conversion is achieved in synchronism with the clock signal of 810 MHz. At the same time, the clock signal of 810 MHz is divided in frequency by 2, and the frequency divided clock signal of 405 MHz is supplied to both the first and second pre group multiplexers 1 and 2. The multiplexers 1 and 2 achieve the respective multiplexing operations for the multichannel data trains I and II, respectively, by using the divided clock signal of 405 MHz, so as to produce the first and second pre group data trains D1 and D2. Thus, the oscillator is used, on the one hand, for producing the clock signal of 810 MHz, and on the other hand, for producing the clock signal of 405 MHz. This means that the synchronization between the pre group multiplexers 1 and 2 and the main group multiplexer, i.e., the P S converter 23, can be always ensured. When establishing the related main group multiplexing by using the P S converter 23, it is essential to maintain the synchronization therebetween. The use of such a P S converter is very beneficial from the economical viewpoint, as compared with the conventional main group multiplexer. However, when the P S converter such as this is used, there is some inconvenience caused by the fact that it is impossible to distinguish, in the receiver side, one data train from another data train. That is, the main group data train D12 from the P S converter 23 is merely an alternating mixture of the first and second pre group data trains D1 and D2. Accordingly, it is also important to introduce a means for distinguishing one data train D1 from the other data train D2 . In the receiver side of the system, the output data train, i.e., the main group data train D12, is received from the transmission line 9 and then supplied to the interface unit INF 5 first. The received main group data train is then supplied to the serial parallel converter S P 26, wherein the multiplexed serial data train D 12 having a transmission rate of 810 Mb s is demultiplexed into the first pre group data train D 1 and the second pre group data train D 2. The thus demultiplexed pre group data trains D 1 and D 2 are then applied to the first selector SEL1 21 and the second selector SEL2 22. The selector 21 selects a specified one of the data trains D 1 and D 2 and the selector 22 selects the other data train, in accordance with the first and second control signals given from the discriminators 27 and 28, respectively. Although the output from the S P converter 26 is, as mentioned previously, an alternating mixture of the two data trains, the selectors 21 and 22 can separate the two data trains into one data train, i.e., the data train D 1, and into another data train, i.e., the data train D 2. Thus pre determined first and second pre group data trains D 1 and D 2 having a transmission rate of 405 Mb s are applied to the first and second pre group demultiplexers DMUX1, DMUX2 7 and 8, as in the conventional system, to obtain the first and second 9 channel data trains I and II having a transmission rate of 45 Mb s, respectively. The first and second discriminators 27 and 28 receive the demultiplexed sub data signals individually from the demultiplexers 7 and 8, and discriminate whether or not the selected pre group data trains coincide with the own side data trains allotted, in advance, to the demultiplexers 7 and 8, by detecting the signal patterns of the sub data signals. That is, when the discriminator 27 28 finds that the pre group data train, now selected by the selector 21 22 , is an own side data train, i.e., D 1 D 2 , the discriminator 27 28 causes the selector 21 22 to leave the current selection state as it is. If the pre group data is not an own side data train but another side D 2 D 1 data train, the discriminator 27 28 causes the selector 21 22 to switch the selection state and hold the alloted own side data train D 1 D 2 . As mentioned before, these two data trains D1 and D2 are differentiated by the individual signal patterns of the sub data signals. The sub data signal having one signal pattern is shown as FY1 in Fig. 2 and the sub data signal having another signal pattern is shown as FY2. These signal patterns will be explained in detail hereinafter. Note, it should be understood that, in the example mentioned above, two pre group data trains, each having the transmission rate of 405 Mb s, are multiplexed into the main group data train having a transmission rate of 810 Mb s. However, the present invention can be applied to a case where three or more pre group data trains, each having a transmission rate of 405 Mb s, are multiplexed by parallel serial conversion at the P S converter. For example, if four pre group data trains, each having a transmission rate of 405 Mb s, are serialized by the P S converter, the data trains are multiplexed to form a main group data train having a transmission rate of 1620 405 x 4 Mb s. In this case, the four data trains contained in the 1620 Mb s data train must be distinguished from each other by using four individual sub data signals having different signal patterns. Figure 3 depicts an example of a data format of a pre group data train. Note, although only the pre group data train D1 from the first pre group multiplexer 1 Fig. 2 is taken as the above example, the other data train D2 also has the same data format as shown in Fig. 3. Further, the bit patterns, starting from a frame synchronization signal F and continuing through 1 63 , H 126 , S1 189 , S2 442 , to the final main data 503 , consist of each frame FR contained in the data train D1 having a transmission rate of 405 Mb s. Each of the frame synchronization signals F and In the data format shown in Fig. 3, the sub data signals F, H, As mentioned above, according to an example of the present invention, the first and second pre group data trains D1 and D2 can be distinguished, in the transmitter, from each other by watching the respective signal patterns of the sub data signals, i.e., the order wire bits Y1 and Y2 contained in the frame synchronization signals F and The method by which the specially processed order wire signals FY1 and FY2 can be used for the discrimination concerned, will be clarified below. The order wire signal FY1 also FY2 , as well as the fault indication signal X1, X2 , is usually set up in the form of a frame. Therefore, the order wire signal must contain the frame synchronization signal therein, as shown by the identical signal F Figures 4A, 4B, and 4C depict bit patterns of the order wires for distinguishing one data train from another data train. The bit patterns will further clarify the difference in the signal patterns of the sub data signals, i.e., the order wires OWa and OWb. The order wire OWa also OWb is composed of successive frames fr to carry data such as voice signals. Each frame fr is composed of 11 bits and each head bit thereof serves as the frame synchronization signal f. Note that two bits of each of the order wires OWa and OWb are collected every time the frame FR Fig. 3 is sent to the receiver side. Therefore, the order wires OWa and OWb usually have a very low frequency, as compared with the main and sub data signals. In Fig. 4, CW denotes clock windows. The clock windows CW are shifted in time until alternating bits 1 and 0 , and vice versa, are detected. At this time, it is determined that the order wires OWa and OWb are synchronized, and accordingly, the information now received from the order wires OWa and OWb is significant. Namely, the signal pattern of the order wire OWa appears with a 1010 pattern and this pattern coincides with the signal pattern of the order wire OWb, and thus the related data train can be classified as D1 due to this signal pattern coincidence. Alternatively, if the signal pattern of the order wire OWa appears with a 1010 pattern and the pattern does not coincide with the other signal pattern, it is determined that the related data train is to be classified as D2. Figures 5A and 5B illustrate a hierarchical data transmission system, according to the present invention, in which the order wire signals are used for the discrimination of data trains. That is, the sub data signals FY1 and FY2 shown in Fig. 2 are specifically realized with the frame synchronization signals for the order wires OWa and OWb. The frame synchronization signal f is supplied to the multiplexer 1 with the signal pattern of 1010 for the order wire OWa and also for the order wire OWb, which signal patterns identify the data train as D1. On the other hand, the frame synchronization signal f is supplied to the multiplexer 2 with the signal pattern of 1010 for OWa and the reversed 0101 for the OWb, which signal patterns identify the data train as D2. The first and second pre group data trains D1 and D2 are produced by multiplexing with the frame order wires having the specified patterns of the frame synchronization signals in the multiplexers 1 and 2, and by the stuffing synchronization operation. The thus processed data trains D1 and D2 have the data format shown in Fig. 3, as mentioned previously. The main group data train D12 is then obtained through the P S converter 23. In this case, according to the previously described example, the multiplexers 1 and 2 are operated with a clock of 405 MHz, and the P S converter 23 is operated with a clock of 810 MHz. These clocks must be synchronized with each other, as mentioned previously. To this end, an oscillator 31 generates a clock of 810 MHz, and the 810 MHz clock is directly supplied to the P S converter 23, and a 405 MHz clock, which is divided in frequency at a frequency divider 32 having a dividing ratio of 1 2, is supplied to both the multiplexers 1 and 2. This enables provision of the pre group data trains D1 and D2 synchronized with each other at 405 Mb s, and simultaneously, the main group data train D12 synchronized therewith at 810 Mb s. Note that, in Figs. 5A and 5B, components corresponding to the interface units 4 and 5 of Fig. 2 are exemplified by an optical sending unit OS 34 and an optical receiving unit OR 35, respectively. In the receiver side of Fig. 5B, the clock of 810 Mb s is reproduced in the unit 35 from the received data train D12 and sent to the S P converter 26 for demultiplexing the data train D12 into the pre group data trains D 1 and D 2. The above mentioned clock of 810 Mb s is divided in frequency by 2 at a frequency divider 33 to supply the divided clock commonly to both the demultiplexers 7 and 8. This clock distribution enables the establishment of a synchronization between the S P converter 26 and the demultiplexers 7 and 8. At this time, the demultiplexed pre group data trains D 1 and D 2 are applied to both the first and second selectors 21 and 22 simultaneously. Since the demultiplexer 7 produces the first multichannel data train I, the selector 21 must select the first pre group data train D1. If the data train D1 is actually selected, the signal patterns derived from the demultiplexed data train would coincide with the previously allotted signal patterns illustrated at top right in Fig. 5B. The coincidence is detected at the discriminator 27, as explained before. This also applies to the detection of a coincidence carried out in the side of the multichannel data train II, with the use of the allotted signal patterns illustrated at the bottom right in Fig. 5B. Figure 6 shows a receiver side of the hierarchical data transmission system, according to the present invention, and illustrates a more detailed diagram of the discriminators. The first discriminator 27 is comprised of a first synchronization circuit SYNC1 41, a first comparator COMP1 43, and a first safe guard circuit GD1 45. The second discriminator 28 has an identical circuit arrangement to that of the first discriminator 27, that is, the discriminator 28 is comprised of a second synchronization circuit SYNC2 42, a second comparator COMP2 44, and a second safe guard circuit GD2 46. The first comparator 43 operates to detect the coincidence between the signal patterns of the frame synchronization signals for the order wires OWa and OWb, i.e., 1010 and 1010 , and the second comparator 44 operates to detect the non coincidence between the signal patterns of the frame synchronization signals for the order wires OWa and OWb, i.e., 1010 and 0101 . In the first comparator 43, the related comparison is valid only when the synchronization is fully established regarding the order wire signal, and accordingly, the comparator 43 is selectively activated by the output from the first synchronization circuit 41. This also applies to the second comparator 44, i.e., the comparator 44 is selectively activated by the output from the second synchronization circuit 42. The first safe guard circuit 45 operates to count the predetermined number of successive identical logic outputs, to ensure a correct switching for the selector 21. This circuit 45 can comprise a counter. This also applies to the second safe guard circuit 46. If the selector 21 correctly holds the own side data train, i.e., the discriminator 27 maintains the selection state at the selector 21 as it is, or if not, the discriminator 27 causes the selection state to change. Thus the selector 21 holds the own side data train, i.e., D 1. This also applies to the other side data train D 2 , discriminator 28, and selector 22. Figure 7 illustrates a detailed example of the first comparator in Fig. 6, and Figure 8 illustrates a detailed example of the second comparator in Fig. 6. In Figs. 7 and 8, a preset terminal 57 is fixedly supplied with logic 1 , and the corresponding terminal 58 is fixedly supplied with logic 0 . The frame synchronization signals of the order wires OWa and OWb are selected at NOR gates 53 and 56 with the aid of the synchronization circuits 41 and 42, respectively. The signal patterns for the own side data train D1 coincide with each other, and therefore a first EXOR exclusive OR gate 51 produces a logic 0 , because of this coincidence. The thus produced logic 0 is given to a second EXOR gate 52, which produces a logic 1 . Thus, the NOR gate 53 produces a logic 0 , which is valid every time the clock window CW Fig. 4C is generated, so as to seek only the frame synchronization signal f Figs. 4A and 4B . In this case, the selector 21 maintains the selection state thereof as it is. If the output logic of the NOR gate 53 indicates 1 , this means that the selection state should be changed to the other side to hold the own side data train D1 . On the other hand, the signal patterns for the other side data train D2 do not coincide with each other, and therefore a first EXOR gate 54 produces a logic 1 . Accordingly, a second EXOR gate 55 produces a logic 1 . Thus, the NOR gate 56 produces a logic 0 , which is valid every time the clock window is generated, as for the own side data train D1. In this case, the selector 22 maintains the selection state thereof as it is. If the output logic of the NOR gate 56 indicates 1 , this means that the selection state should be changed to the other side to hold the other side data train D2 . In Figs. 7 and 8, the preset terminals 57 and 58 are preferably fabricated as connectors connectable to suitable pins supplying logic levels 0 and 1 . Usually, the demultiplexers 7 and 8 are fabricated, as integral units, independently from each other. Further, the demultiplexer units are mounted separately, by inserting the units into a shelf. In this case, the units are connected via connectors 57, 58 , respectively, and thus the respective pins automatically supply the logics 1 and 0 , respectively, to the connectors 57 and 58. This produces an advantage in that the separation from one side multichannel data train D1 to the other side multichannel data train D2 can be smoothly and easily attained. In this case, the logics to be supplied to the pins can be specified by a computer managing the overall transmission system. If three or more kinds of multichannel data trains, e.g., D1, D2, D3 , are involved, it is sufficient to provide a plurality of pins for each respective connector. When, for example, two pins are provided for each connector, four 2² kinds of data trains D1 through D4 can be discriminated from one another. Figure 9 is a circuit diagram of an example of the parallel serial converting multiplexer 23 shown in Figs. 2 and 5A. The P S converter 23 is generally comprised of a plurality of front stage D flip flops for receiving the individual data trains and driven by a sub clock, a plurality of reading gates which are connected to the outputs of the corresponding D flip flops and sequentially read the outputs thereof by using a processed sub clock, to obtain serialized data trains having a transmission rate substantially equal to the reference clock, and a rear stage D flip flop receiving the thus obtained serialized data trains and producing the main group data train in synchronism with the reference clock. The P S converter 23 of Fig. 9 is constructed to conform with the previous example, that is the two data trains D1 and D2 having a transmission rate substantially equal to the 405 MHz sub clock are serialized into the main group data train D12 having a transmission rate substantially equal to the clock of 810 MHz. Accordingly, two front stage D flip flops 61 and 62 are used. The outputs from the D flip flops 61 and 62 are supplied to the reading gates, which consist of a first NOR gate 63, a second NOR gate 64, a delay element 67, and an inverter 68. These reading gates 63, 64, 67, 68 produce serialized first and second data trains from a NOR gate 65, which are then applied to a rear stage D flip flop 66 to produce the main group data train D12 synchronized with the reference clock of 810 MHz. Figures 10A through 10H depict waveforms of signals appearing at portions A through D shown in Fig. 9, respectively. The operation of the P S converter 23 shown in Fig. 9 will be further clarified by referring to Figs. 10A through 10H. Figure 11 is a circuit diagram of an example of the serial parallel converting demultiplexer shown in Figs. 2, 5A, and 6. The S P converter 26 can be generally comprised of a plurality of D flip flops and a plurality of shift clock generators. According to the previously mentioned example, two kinds of pre group data trains D1 and D2 are dealt with, and accordingly, a first D flip flop 261 and a second D flip flop 262 are employed. These flip flops are driven by first and second clocks from a first delay element 263, such as a delay line, and a second delay element 264, respectively. The first delay element 263 receives the sub clock, i.e., 405 MHz. Figures 12A through 12D depict waveform of signals appearing at portions A through D in Fig. 11, respectively. The operation of the S P converter 26 will be explained with reference to Figs. 12A through 12D. The sub clock of 405 MHz Fig. 12B at the portion B is obtained from the received data train D12 shown in Fig. 12A. The delay elements 263 and 264 are used for adjusting the phase of the clock in such a manner that the clocks at the portions C and D can correctly strike at the center of each of the data trains D 1 and D 2, as schematically illustrated by vertical arrows in Figs. 12C and 12D. Figure 13 illustrates a circuit diagram of an example of the selector SEL1 shown in Figs. 2, 5A, and 6. The first and second selectors 21 and 22 have the same construction, and therefore, only the first selector SEL1 21 is representatively illustrated in Fig. 13. The selector 21 can be generally comprised of a plurality of NOR gates. One of the AND gates is allowed to pass therethrough the received pre group data train, in accordance with the instructions given from the corresponding discriminator DISC1 27. According to the previously mentioned example, two pre groups data trains D 1 and D 2, and therefore, two NOR gates 211 and 212 are employed. The control signal therefor is given from the discriminator 27, via the safe guard circuit 45, so that either one of the data trains D 1 and D 2 is selected due to an inverting input 214. The thus selected data train is applied, via the OR gate 213, specifically shown in the form of a NOR gate in Fig. 13, to the first demultiplexer DMUX1 7. Each of the synchronization circuits SYNC1, SYNC2 , shown by 41 and 42 in Fig. 6, can be generally formed with a comparator, an inhibiting gate, and a pattern generator. The comparator receives, on one hand, the pre group data train and, on the other hand, the predetermined frame signal pattern. The comparator produces an inhibiting signal every time a noncoincidence therebetween is detected by the comparator. The inhibiting gate passes therethrough a sub data clock signal generated in the demultiplexer 7, to be supplied to the pattern generator. The pattern generator produces the frame synchronization signal. In this case, the inhibiting gate operates to stop the passage of the sub data clock every time a noncoincidence occurs. Figure 14A is a circuit diagram of an example of the synchronization circuit shown in Fig. 6. The first and second synchronization circuits 41 and 42 have basically similar constructions, and therefore, the first synchronization circuit only is illustrated in Fig. 14A. The synchronization circuit 41 is comprised of a shift register 411, an EXOR gate 412, AND gates 413 and 414, and a pattern generator PGR 415. A safe guard circuit GD 416 can be employed, if necessary. The aforesaid comparator corresponds to the AND gate 413, the aforesaid inhibiting gate corresponds to the AND gate 414, and the aforesaid pattern generator corresponds to the pattern generator 415. The operation of the synchronization circuit will be made apparent with reference to Figs. 4A through 4C and Figs. 14B through 14G. The sub data signals, in this example, the order wires OWa and OWb Fig. 4A , are applied to the shift register 411 and stored therein for a duration of ten time slots. The output from the pattern generator is used, finally, as the clock window CW Fig. 4C when the synchronization is established. Initially, however, synchronization is not established, and the AND gate 413 seeks the coincidence, together with the shift register 411 and the pattern generator 415, between the frame signals f of the order wire OWa and OWb. When the EXOR gate 412 produces logics 1111 in synchronism with the clock window CW, the AND gate 413 continually produces a logic 0 . During the noncoincidence therebetween, the AND gate 413 produces logic 1 , and therefore, the inhibiting gate 414 is closed. Therefore, the sub data clock inherently contained in the order wires OWa and OWb is stopped from passing therethrough. Thereby the phase of the clock window CW is delayed, which operation is repeated until the clock window CW reaches a nominal phase position, i.e., a synchronization mode. The safe guard circuit 416 is useful for protecting the synchronization mode after the establishment thereof. The guard circuit 416 can be a counter, and thus, the guard circuit 416 does not produce the logic 1 until the logic 1 appears a number of predetermined times. This means that if a logic 1 is erroneously generated from the EXOR gate 413 during the synchronization state, the synchronization state is still maintained so long as the predetermined number of logics 1 are sent from the EXOR gate 413. The above mentioned explanations are made by taking as an example a case wherein the two pre group data trains D1 and D2 are dealt with for data transmission. Obviously, the transmission frequency of the system will soon be increased to more than 810 MHz, such as 1.6 GHz, in the future. In such a high speed transmission system, three or more pre group data trains having a transmission frequency of 405 MHz will be multiplexed to produce a main group data train having a transmission frequency of about 1.6 GHz. If three pre group data trains are to be multiplexed, the signal patterns of the sub data signals must be different from that of Figs. 4A and 4B. One example thereof will be described below. Figures 15A, 15B, and 15C depict signal patterns of the sub data signals, where three pre group data trains are to be distinguished from each other. Note, in the example, the related sub data signals are composed of the order wire signals, as in the previous example. As seen from Figs. 15A through 15D, the frame synchronization signals provide three different modes. That is, in Fig. 15A, all the signal patterns are different from one another and may be allotted to the data train D1. In Fig. 15C, all the signal patterns are the same as one another and may be allotted to the data train D3. In Fig. 15B, one of the three signal patterns is different from the remaining signal patterns and may be allotted to the data train D2. Figure 16 is a circuit diagram of an example of a discriminator used for distinguishing the signal patterns shown in Figs. 15A, 15B, and 15C. Figure 16 illustrates only a major portion of the discriminator corresponding to the discriminators shown in Fig. 6. That is, the major portion corresponds to each of the comparators COMP1, COMP2 of Fig. 6. The demultiplexer 7 8 produces the order wire signals OWa, OWb, and OWc, and these are applied to three EXOR gates 71, 72, and 73 with the wiring arrangement as illustrated. The EXOR gates 71, 72, and 73 are connected with three comparators 74, 75, and 76, as illustrated. The comparators 74, 75, and 76 contain individual comparison bits, i.e., 111 , 110 , and 000 . Therefore, when the comparator 74 produces a coincidence signal SD1, this indicates that the received pre group data train belongs to the first data train D1. This also applies to the remaining comparators 75 and 76. As mentioned above in detail, the present invention can realize a main group multiplexer and main group demultiplexer having a very simple structure.
