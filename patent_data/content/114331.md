## Description
A PROCESS FOR PREPARING OXANOSINE AND AN INTERMEDIATEUSED IN THIS PROCESSThis invention relates to the synthesis of oxanosine, an antibiotic having carcinostatic activity.Oxanoxine 5 amino 3 ss D ribofuranosyl 3H imidazo 4,5 d 1,3 oxazin 7 one was isolated by Bamao Omezawa et al. from culture broth of Streptomyces capreolus MG265 CF3 DepositNo. 5735 at the Fermentation Researach Institute, Agency ofIndustrial Science and Technology, Ministry of Internaticnal Trade and Industry of Japan see the Journal ofAntibiotics, Vol. 34, p.l216 1218, 1981 . Now, it has been found out that oxanosine expressed by the formula 11 EMI1.1 can be obtained by hydrolyzlng a 2 O protected oxanosine of the general formula I EMI2.1 wherein R1 represents a preotective group R2 and R3 each represent a hydrogen atom or a protective group and R1 and R2 may be bound together to form a ring, thereby to eliminate the protective group s . This finding led us to achieve the present inventionR1 in the general formula I of this invention may be any protective group which can be used to protect a hydroxyl group.Preferred examples of R1 are a cyclic ether type protective group or those bound to R2 to form a ring which serves as a ketal type protective group Examples of the protective group resulting from ring Ã²rmation are substi tuted or unsubstituted alkylidene groups, such as an isopropylidene group, a p anisylidene group, a benzylidene group, a cyclohexylidene group, an ethylidene group and a methoxyethylidene group Examples of a cyclic ether type protective group are a tetrahydropyranyl group, a 4 methoxy tetrahydropyran 4 yl group, a tetrahydrothiofuranyl group and a tetrahydrothiopyranyl group.The above mentioned elimination Or. the protective group s by hydrolysis can be performed by a customary method If the protective group is a tetrahydropyranyl group or one of a ketal type, such as an isopropylidene group, for example, it is preferred to eliminate it with heating say at a temperature of 400C or higher preferably, under reflux in the presence of an acid such as hydrochloric acid or acetic acid. The 2 O protected oxanosine of the general formula I , used as the starting compound in this invention is synthesized in the manner described below.A S amino l O protected A D ribofuranosyl 4 imidazole carboxylic acid alkyl ester of the general formula III EMI3.1 wherein R1, R2 and R3 are as defined above, and R4 represents lower alkyl group, is condensed with a carbonyl isothiocyanate of the general formula IV EMI3.2 wherein X represents a lower alkoxy group or a phenol group, to form a 5 substituted amino 1 O protected ss D ribofurano syl 4 imidazolecarboxylic acid alkyl ester of the general formula V EMI3.3 wherein Rl, R2, R3, R4 and X are s defined above. The resulting compound is subject tothe action of an alkyl iodide to form an S alkyl derivative of the general formula VI EMI4.1 wherein R1, R2, R3, R4 and X are as defined above, and R5 represents a lower alkyl groupThis compound is heated in the presence of an alkali e.g.a hydroxide such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, or a carbonate such as sodium carbonate or potassium carbonate to form a 5 cyanymido 1 O protected ss D ribo furanosyl 4 imidazolecarboxylic acid metal salt 0 the formula VII EMI4.2 wherein X represents a metal atom, and n denotes the valence or the metai atom.Neutralization of the compound of the formula VII gives the 2l O protect2d oxanosine of the general formula I . The compound of the general formula III , in which R4 represents an ethyl group, R3 is a hydrogen atom, and R1 and R2 are bonded together to form an isopropylidene group, i.e., 5 amino 1 2, 3 0 isopropyliden.e ss D ribofuranosyl 4 imidazolecarboxylic acid ethyl ester, is a known compound synthesized by N. J, Cusack et al. Journal of Chemical Society, Part I, 1973 Issue, p.1720, 1973 . Other compounds expressed by the general formula III can be synthesized in accordance with the method described in this literature. Examples of the lower alkyl group in the present invention are methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl. Examples of the carbonyl isothiocyanate of the general formula IV include methoxycarbonyl isothiocyanate, etboxycarbonyl isothiocyanate, propoxycarbonyl isothiocyanate and benzoyl isothiocyanate. In the case of benzoyl isothiocyanate, a substituent which will exert no adverse influence on the reaction may be present on the phenyl group. The condensation between the compound of the formula III and the compound of the formula IV can be carried out, at a temperature of 0 to 400C, preferably, at room temperature usually, in an organic solvent, e.g., a polar organic solvent such as dimethylformamide.
