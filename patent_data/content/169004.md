## Abstract
Means for associating a driver 8 with the driver operating mechanism 2 of a fastener driving tool 1 , the driver 8 con stituting a part of a fastener containing magazine 5 manually attachably to and detachable from the tool. The fastener driv ing tool is of the type having a housing 3 containing a driving element constituting a part of an operating mechanism for driv ing a fastener by multiple blows, or a driving element constitut ing a part of an operating mechanism for driving a fastener by a single blow. In the instance of a multiple blow tool, a resilient element 21 , attached to the tool housing adjacent the driver operating mechanism and the driver operating mechanism it self, releasably positions the upper end of the magazine driver adjacent the driving element of the tool. In the instance of a single blow tool, the magazine driver is releasably positioned adjacent the driving element of the tool by a resilient element attached directly to the driving element of the tool.
