# REHYDRATABLE INSTANT ACTIVE DRIED YEAST

## Abstract
An instant type active dry yeast is provided which contains either 1 locust bean gum or gum ghatti in an amount from about 0.1 to about 2.0 by weight of the yeast dry matter basis or 2 carboxymethylcellulose or guar gum in an amount from about 0.1 to about 0.4 by weight of the yeast dry matter basis or 3 mixtures of any of these materials. An instant type active dry yeast of the invention has a high leavening activity when used in direct addition processes as well as a comparably high leavening activity when employed in processes in which the yeast is first rehydrated prior to its admixture with flour and remain ing dough or batter ingredients. Instant type active dry yeasts of the present invention exhibit the ability to be relatively rapidly and uniformly dispersed when employed in a manner in which the yeast is first separately rehydrated prior to admixture with flour and other remaining dough or batter ingredients.
