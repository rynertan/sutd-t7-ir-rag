## Description
NEW CHEWING GUM BASE AND PROCESS FOR PREPARINGSAME AND THEIR USE IN A CHEWING GUM The present invention relates to the art of chewing gum base composition and, in particular, to novel chewing gum base compositions in which desired characteristics can be achieved by unique combinations of primary components hereto four unknown. Chewing gums, as they are known today, generally comprise a water soluble flavor portion which is dissipated over a period of time, and a base portion which. is insoluble and inert and is retained in the oral cavity throughout mastication. Depending on the intended effect of the particular chewing gum product, the base portion is composited with components selected from the effect achieved thereby and based on their compatibility. One important component of a gum base is the elastomeric portion which, according to the present state of the art, can include natural elastomers, synthetic elastomers, or combinations thereof. This element of the gum base is important in that it provides the insoluble cud with resiliency to recover from deformation caused by chewing. In preparing gum base, it is important that other components included in the base composition which are included to effect various characteristics in the resùlting chewing gum be thoroughly mixed with the elastomeric portion so that the entire cud retain proper resiliency as a homogeneous phase. In order to achieve a homogeneous phase cud wherein a proper resiliency is constant throughout, it is necessary to provide components which are as nearly miscible with the elastomer as possible. This result is not easily attained in the gum base art because the various components must not only come together as a homogeneous mass during initial mixing but must also remain in the homogeneous state during chewing gum compounding with the water soluble portion, during processing, e.g., gum unit production and wrapping, and while chewing. Factors such as the effect of the water soluble components, heat, moisture, etc. must be considered in preparing a useable gum base. Moreover, since, as in all food arts, chewing gum production is necessarily constrained by economical, processing, marketing, and safety factors, mere physical and chemical compatibility is not the only concern. So constrained, the art of making chewing gum has evolved through the years by building only on known workable combinations of useable ingredients. Consequently, in attempting to achieve a particular attribute or combination of attributes in a chewing gum, it has been necessary to utilize the component known to provide such attribute s in the resulting gum along with that component s accompanying compatibilizing ingredients which may detract significantly from the end product or seriously constrain the use of certain other additives such as flavorants, sweetener, antioxidants, etc. with the particular component. When adding resinous components to elastomers problems enunciated above relative to compatibility are especially troublesome, since both elastomers and resins are polymers. The difference in the nature of an elastomer from that of a resin is, among other things, one of degree of internal mobility between polymer chains. Both elastomers and polymeric resins inherently have a characteristic intensity of intermolecular interaction, called the cohesive energy density, which, in general, must be overcome to some extent in order to achieve compatibility between these two types of components. Attractive forces between organic molecules, which account for the characteristic cohesive energy density, include, among other things, Van der Waals forces, dispersion forces, dipole dipole forces, dipole induced dipole forces, and acid base forces, of which the most important is hydrogen bonding. A gross measure of all such forces can be expressed as a Hildebrand solubility parameter, S , which is an expression of the solubility of a particular substance. In theory, the miscibility of polymers relates to those having comparable solubility parameters, which is generally considered in the polymer art as those polymers having a difference in solubility parameters of less than 1.7 2.0, S. KrÅause, Polymer Compatibility , J. Macromal.Sci Macromal. Chem C7, pg. 251 314 1972 . While it is known that straight mechanical shearing may be used to intimately contact polymers having disparate chemical and structural properties, such methods may also depolymerize the components thus destroying desired inherent polymer properties such as memory i.e., elasticity and film forming capabilites i.e., relative displacement without rupture of intermolecular bonding . To overcome these problems different ingredients have been used in an attempt to compatibilize resins and elastomers without total depolymerization. In particular, the elastomer styrene butadiene copolymer SBR has in the past required the use of accompanying ester gums glycerol esters of rosin in order to effect compatibilization with other chewing gum base components, and in order to achieve film forming properties which is desired for bubble gum bases. The use of ester gums with styrene butadiene has, however, been found to generate problems such as inherent oxidative instability and tackiness in the chewing gum product. Furthermore chewing gum bases made by use of SBR and ester gums characteristically are rigid, very hard, brittle, non chewable, and require a significant amount of energy as well as the addition of extensive amounts of softeners, fillers, etc.to achieve the proper texture for use in a chewing gum.To overcome the defects associated with the use of styrenebutadiene in combination with ester gums, those skilled in the gum art have traditionally approached the problem on a trial and error basis by incorporating additional ingredients which provide the desired characteristics in the end product. Now, however, by use of the present invention, which contemplates proper plasticization principles applied to the external plasticization of primary gum base components, i.e., elastomer and resin, heretofor considered incompatible, a soft, inherently stable SBR gum base can be produced which also has excellent film forming properties and is essentially non tacky. Similarly, with regard to polyisobutylene elastomer PIB it has been considered necessary to include certain accompanying ingredients to effect compatibilization with other gum base components. For example, U.S. Patent No. 3,984,574 to Comollo discloses a gum base which includes polyisobutylene in combination with polyvinyl acetate but which also requires additional components such as hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated vegetable oils or animal fats in an amount of 5 50 , and filler mineral adjutants in an amount of 5 40 , in order to allegedly achieve an abhesive or non tacky base. Indeed, the use Qf filler with polyisobutylene polyvinyl acetate in gum base is considered common practice in the art. Through the present invention, however, polyisobutylene can be combined with the characteristIcally good film forming high molecularweight polyvinyl acetate to form a gum base of soft consistency in the absence of not only filler, but also other softening additives usually included in polyisobutylene such as hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated animal fats or vegetable oils. Furthermore, with respect to the use of isobutylene isoprene copolymer butyl rubber , by use of the present invention, a soft gum base with good film forming characteristics has been achieved in the absence of both ester gums and filler thusmaking it useable as a bubble gum base. Therefore, by means of the present invention, many of the problems associated with compounding a desired gum base can be overcome by a rational, technical approach, which, in effect, reduces the trial and error method of making gum to a predictable science. In accordance with the present invention, a gum base is provided which is formed essentially offa properly plasticized elastomer, such as, for example, a styrenebutadiene copolymer plasticized as described hereinafter a properly plasticized resin, such as, for example, polyvinyl acetate, as described hereinafter and, optionally a third emulsifying softening texturizing component which may include all other abhesive and adhesive types of components generally used in gum base, for example, fillers, such as calcium carbonate or talc, and or waxes natural or synthetic hydrocarbon or ester type , fatty acids and fatty acid esters, antioxidants, oils, resins ester gums, polyterpene and the like. Optionally, fillers such as calcium carbonate and talc, and or wax can be included in any one or all three components to achieve a desired result. Based on proper plasticization principles a model gum base formulation scheme has been devised whereby an elastomer such as SBR, polyisobutylene, and isobutyleneisoprene copolymer and a resin such as polyvinyl acetate can be blended in the appropriate proportions to attain the proper texture, resiliency, flavor retention properties, etc. without regard for the necessity of including extraneous ingredients required to make them compatible and or workable. Based on previously espoused theories it has not been considered feasible to render a S3R chewing gum base with film forming properties in the absence of ester gums, or a PIB PVAC gum base in the absence of filler and other additives, or a butyl rubber base useable in a bubble gum composition. By means of the present invention, however, excellent film forming resins such as high molecular weight polyvinyl acetate, i.e., in excess of at least about 20,000M.W.U., can be made miscible with SBR, PIB, and butyl rubber.In view of the application of solubility theories to the compatibilizing of these primary polymer components this is quite unexpected.. Specifically, the primary resin, high molecular weight polyvinyl acetate, has a solubility parameter of approximately 10.6 Collins, Bares, and Billmeyer, Jr., Preliminary Evaluation of Polymer Properties , Experiments in Polymer Science, page 108 1973 , whereas the solubility parameter of styrene butadiene copolymer is approximately 8.3, and polyisobutylene is approximately 7.8 Bandrup andImmergut, Solubility Parameter Values , Polymer Handbook, pg. IV 362 IV 365 3d ed. 1967 , which theoretically renders them somewhat imcompatible and, at least, immiscible. The elastomer component of the gum base of the invention can contain primarily styrene butadiene copolymer, polyisobutylene, isobutylene isoprene copolymer, natural rubber polyisoprene as well as other masticatory substances of natural origin, such as rubber latex solids, chicle, crown gum, nispero, rosidinha, jelutong, pendare, perillo, niger gutta, tunu, etc. The elastomer is employed in an amount within the range of from 0.5 to about 30 , and preferably from about 5 to about 20 by weight of the gum base. To achieve proper plasticization of the elastomer component in order to gain compatibility, several chemical compounds have been discovered to provide surprisingly good plasticization and or compatibilization of the elastomer with other components, especially resin components. In the preferred embodiments of the present invention, it has been found that plasticization canXbe achieved with unique gum base component plasticizers, such as oleic acid and butyl stearate, although any of the following gum plasticizers may be employed mono , di , or triglyceryl esters of saturated or unsaturated fatty acids, such as stearic acid, palmitic acid, oleic acid, caprylic acid, capric acid, caproic acid, lauric acid and the like, squalene, mineral oil and liquid petroleum hydrocarbons, squalane, castor oil and other ricinoleate derivatives, diethyleneor propylene glycols and derivatives, tributyl acetyl citrate, tributyl citrate, lecithin, coconut oil,.glyceryl tributyrate, Zn laurate, Ca stearate, propylene glycol monostearate, propolyne glycol monolaurate, fatty acids, butyl sebacate, butyl benzyl sebacate, diacetyl tartaric acid esters of. mono and diglycerides of edible fat oils or edible fat forming acids, petrolatum, stearyl monoglycerides citrate, limonene, polylimonene, polyethylene, butyl lactate and butyl oleate. Preferably, the styrene butadiene copolymer is plasticized by use of butyl stearate, glyceryl trioleate, oleic acid, butyl oleate, and butyl benzyl sebacate. In the case of polyisobutylene, polyisoprene, and isobutylene isoprene copolymer the preferred plasticizers include polylimonene, petrolatum, mineral oil, squalane, squalene, and liquid hydrocarbons. The primary resin component used in the present invention is high molecular weight polyvinyl acetate, i.e., at least about 20,000 M.W.U. Other resins which may be employed herein, depending upon the properties desired in final gum base, may include polyvinyl butyl ester, copolymers of vinyl esters and vinyl ethers, polyethylene, ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers, vinyl acetate vinyl alcohol copolymers, vinyl acetate vinyl laurate copolymers.The resin component of the gum base. can be present in an amount of from about 5 to about 75 of the gum base and preferably constitutes from about 10 to about 45 by weight of the gum base. As set forth above high molecular weight polyvinyl acetate is the preferred resin, especially where the gum base is to be used in a bubble gum. In this case, the resin can be properly plasticized using unique plasticizers, such as glyceryl triacetate, acetylated monoglyceride, benzyl benzoate, benzyl butyrate, benzyl phenyl acetate, butyl 2decenoate, citronellyl butyrate, cresyl acetate, ethyl acetate, diethyl malonate, diethyl sebacate, triethylcitrate, diethyl succinate, glyceryl tributyrate, ethyl laurate, ethyl acetoacetate, diethyl tartrate, ethyl or butyl lactate, acetyl triethyl citrate, diethyl malate, ethyl oleate, sucrose octaacetate, diacetyl tartaric acid ester of mono and diglycerides, stearyl monoglyceridyl citrate, castor oil, succinylated monoglycerides, lactylic and glyceryl lacto esters of fatty acids, or combinations thereof, with the glyceryl triacetate and acetylated monoglyceride combination being preferred. With respect to the resin component the plasticizer is included in an amount based on weight of the gum base of from about 18 to about 25 and preferably from about 2 to about 15 . In essence, it has been found that by use of the present invention gum bases may be formed from the elastomer component in combination with high molecular weight polyvinyl acetate. This eliminates the need for ester gums with SBR and, therefore, the accompanying antioxidants usually included with ester gums. In the case of PIB, the need for filler and hydrogenated oils or fats has been eliminated and or reduced significantly and, with respect to isobutylene isoprene copolymer, a good film forming base can be provided in the absence of filler and ester gums, thus making it useable as a bubble gum base. Furthermpre, and quite surprisingly, such combinations can be effected without the inclusion of ingredients such as filler, waxes, etc.However, it will be appreciated that a certain amount of ingredients such as ester gums, fillers, waxes, emulsifiers, colorants, etc. may wish to be included to achieve desired properties without detracting from the overall effect of the present invention. The fillers which can be used in the present gum base in an amount ranging from about 0 to about 60 , and preferably ranging from about 5 to about 45 by weight of the gum base. Examples of fillers suitable for use include, but are not limited to, calcium carbonate, aluminum hydroxide, alumina, magnesium carbonate, dicalcium phosphate, talc 3MgO.4SiO2 H20 , magnesium trisilicate, magnesium hydroxide, aluminum silicates, silica gel, organic fillers and combinations thereof. Calcium carbonate is preferred. However, where acid flavors and or acid sweeteners, such as the free acid form of saccharin, acid cyclamate or aspartame, are employed in the final chewing gum it is preferred to employ a non chalk filler, preferably talc. The gum base of the invention can also include waxes which serve as lubricants and should have a melting point of above about 350C and preferably above about 500C.Examples of such waxes include candelilla wax, carnauba wax, ozokerite, oricury, microcrystalline wax, refine paraffin wax and the like. The waxes will be employed in an amount within the range of from about 1 to about 18 by weight of the gum base, and. preferably from about 3 to about 128. The preferred waxes are microcrystalline wax, and paraffin wax employed in combination so that from about 0 to about 18 based on the weight of the gum base of the microcrystalline wax is employed with from about 0 to about 18 based on the weight of the gum base of the paraffin wax.The waxes are found to reduce the tackiness of the final gum composition without significantly reducing cohesivity thereof. The base of the invention can also include a softening agent and lubricant combination which may comprise one or more hydrogenated vegetable or animal fats having a melting point that is above about 220C, and preferably above about 400C such softening agent and or lubricant may be employed in amounts ranging from about 0 to about 108 by weight of the gum base, and preferably from about 0.5 to about 7 . Examples of softeners suitable for use herein include, but are not limited to, glyceryl monostearate, lecithin, coconut oil, fatty acids, such as stearic, oleic and palmitic, partially hydrolyzed polyvinyl esters, waxes, such as carnauba wax, candelilla wax and beeswax and cellulose derivatives and mono , di and triglyceryl esters of fatty acids as described hereinbefore. An emulsifier can also be included to impart hydrophilic hydrophobic balance to the gum base so that saliva will be absorbed thereby making the gum base slippery the emulsifier will be employed in amounts ranging from about 0 to about 10 by weight of the gum base, and preferably from about 3 to about 9. Examples of such emulsifiers include glyceryl monostearat, phosphatides, such as lecithin and cephalin, Tweens, Spans and mixtures thereof. In addition, the gum base can include colorants pigments, such as titanium dioxide, and anti oxidants when necessary to stabilize non inventive ingredients in an amount up to 1000 ppm of the gum base, such as butylated hydroxyanisole, butylated hydroxy toluene, and propyl gallate.

The ester gums may be employed in an amount ranging from about 0 to about 10 , preferably from about 2 to about 7 by weight of the gum base. In any event, the gum bases of the invention may be formed by preforming each of the primary components and thereafter combining them to form the gum base.

The flavoring may comprise synthetic flavors and oils derived from plants, leaves, flowers, fruit, etc.Representative fruit flavor adjuncts include acids, such as adipic, citric, succinic and fumaric acid, and citrus oils, such as lemon oil, orange oil, lime oil, grapefruit oil, and fruit essences, such as apple essence, pear essence, peach essence, strawberry essence, apricot essence, raspberry essence, cherry essence, plum essence, pineapple essence, as well as the following essential oils peppermint oil, spearmint oil, mixtures of peppermint oil and spearmint oil, clove oil, bay oil, anise oil, eucalyptus oil, thyme oil, cedar leaf oil, cinnamon oil, oil of nutmeg, oil of sage, oil of bitter almonds, cassia oil, and methylsalicylate oil of wintergreen . Various synthetic flavors, such as mixed fruit, may also be incorporated in the chewable gum base with or without conventional preservatives. By utilizing the proper plasticizer for each of the primary components, the properties of the ultimate gum product can be carefully selected based on the inherent attributes of the component, using other additives to merely enhance, maximize or fine tune the qualities attained by the combination of primary components. For a better understanding of the present invention, together with other and further objects, reference is made to the following descriptions of specific examples and its scope will be pointed out in the appended claims. EXAMPLES OF THE INVENTION STYRENE BUTADIENE ELASTOMER The first three examples herein demonstrate the ability to produce a soft, workable gum base with styrenebutadiene copolymer as the elastomer and high molecular weight polyvinyl acetate resin without the use of ester gums and in the absence of additional components which in the past have been considered necessary to provide a useable gum base. EXAMPLE 1 A gum base was,prepared in accordance with the formula shown below which, it is noted, includes neither filler nor ester gum, thereby eliminating the need for antioxidant s Parts by weight Parts by weight Gum Base Ingredients of the Gum Base Elastomer ComponentStyrene butadiene elastomer 24 Bound sytrene 15Butyl Stearate 3 Resin ComponentPolyvinyl Acetate 20,000 40,000 M.W.U. 65Glyceryl Triacetate 9Acetylated Monoglyceride 10 The ingredients were mixed in a Brabender plasticorder at a temperature of about 800C by adding a first portion of the polyvinyl acetate to the SBR, followed by the butyl stearate, the remaining PVAc, the glyceryl triacetate, and acetylated monoglyceride. The gum base was found to be smooth, and semi fluid, flowed easily at the mixing temperature, and retained a fairly constant viscosity as ingredients were added, all of which enhance the economic value of the base since the energy required for blending is thereby minimized. On cooling, no phase separation was observed and the base possessed film forming attributes, i.e., it had good bubble forming properties and could be used as a base for bubble gum. The gum base was also non stick abhesive , chewed well, had bland taste, and good organoleptic quality, i.e., good mouth feel. Since there was no filler included therein, the gum base can be used with acid sweeteners and or flavors. Moreover, and perhaps most importantly, the cooled base was soft and easily deformable in contrast to the impenetrable, hard, brittle nature of SBR gum bases known to date. This soft texture markedly increases the economic value of the base because of the reduced work energy required to mechanically masticate the soft base when preparing a chewing gum composition. EXAMPLE 2 This example shows a styrene butadiene gum base with the same amount of elastomer as the first example but with a different composition of elastomer and plasticizer therefor.

Again there was no observable phase separation upon cooling and the base had good film formiiig properties as well as displaying a bland taste, good organoleptic quality, abhesivity, and a generally soft, deformable or malleable texture. EXAMPLE 3 Another example was prepared in accordance with the formula shown below wherein the amount of elastomer was increased and in which low molecular weight polyvinyl acetate was included. Parts By WeightGum Base Ingredients of the Gum Base Elastomer ComponentStyrene butadiene elastomer 20Butyl stearate 5 Resin ComponentPolyvinyl Acetate M.W. 20,000 40,000 40Low Molecular Weight Polyvinyl Acetate 25Glyceryl Triacetate 7Acetylated Monoglyceride 3 The resulting gum base, which was mixed as in the Examples 1 and 2, enjoyed the same advantageous soft, malleable texture while having good film forming and abhesive properties. These formulae provide excellent economical bases for bubble gum because of their good film forming ability and abhesivity. In order to demonstrate the unexpected results relative to producing a soft styrene butadiene base in the absence of ester gum by use of the present invention, tests were conducted on samples of gum base produced inExamples 1, 2 and 3. Since production of a chewing gum composition includes the process of mechanical mastication of the gum base along with the other gum composition in gredients, the ease with which the gum base can be deformed under mechanical pressure is a good measure of its processability. Accordingly, one type of test that can be made to determine the processability of a gum base is a hardness test which is the measure of the resistance of a material to local deformation. Hardness tests generally measure the depth of penetration of an indentor or probe under a specific set of conditions. Samples from the gum bases prepared in the above Examples were subjected to hardness tests according to ASTM D 1321 employing a penetrometer PrecisionScientific Co. , as were also samples of styrene butadiene elastomer gum base ester gum included therein as a film forming ingredient. These tests were conducted at room temperature 24.50C under a constant load of 100 gums. SBR ester base, which is commonly used as the gum base for bubble gum compositions and is used commercially has the following general formula Parts By WeightSBR Ester Gum Base of the Gum BaseStyrene butadiene Copolymer 6 to 148 Ester Gum 18 to 36 Filler usually CaCO3 18 to 44 Low Molecular Weight PVAc Organic Filler 15 to 45 Waxes 1 to 26 Fatty Acid Esters 6 to 15 Samples A, B and C were of the SBR ester gum general formula indicated above, with the exception ofSample C, which contained no fillers. Each of the samples were subjected to 3 to 5 runs each under the penetrometer and the mean value of penetration in 1 10 millimeters after 5 seconds under constant load was determined in order to minimize the effect of any anomolous results. Results of the comparative tests are set forth below in Table I. TABLE I Penetrometer Test Mean Penetration measured after 5 seconds under constant load ofSamples 100 gms. at 24.50CFrom Example 1 38.5From Example 2 26.8From Example 3 25.6SBR Ester A 4.0SBR Ester B 1.3 SBR Ester C No filler 5.0 As evident from the data, the Samples 1, 2 and 3 exhibited a surprisingly lower degree of hardness thus evidencing a highly malleable gum base prepared according to the invention. While samples of the invention registered a degree of softness clearly an order of magnitude greater than the samples taken from the art, it is believed that gum base measuring no less than about 15 one tenth millimeter units in the above test would offer a significant advantage over the prior art gum bases. Preferably, the gum base would measure no less than about 20, and most preferably no less than about 25.

POLYISOBUTYLENE ELASTOMER As in the case of styrene butadiene copolymer elastomer bases, gum bases which included polyisobutylene as the elastomer component were prepared in accordance with the present invention. Once again, and contrary to common practice in the art of preparing polyisobutylene gum bases having good film forming properties, it was found that by use of the present invention neither filler nor other ingredients normally associated with compatibilizing the primary components, such as hydrogenated animals fats or vegetable oils, were required to produce a soft, essentially non tacky base. EXAMPLE 14 A polyisobutylene gum base was prepared as described below according to the following formula. Parts by WeightGum Base Ingredients of the Gum Base Elastomer ComponentPolyisobutylene elastomer 15Polylimonene 3 Resin ComponentPolyvinyl acetate M.W. 20,000 40,000 65Glycerol Triacetate 9Acetylated Monoglyceride 8 The ingredients were mixed in a Brabender plasticorder at a temperature of about 800C by introducing the polyisobutylene elastomer followed by a first portion of the polyvinyl acetate, the polylimonene, a second portion of the polyvinyl acetate, glyceryl triacetate, and the acetylated monoglyceride. The gum base formed was found to be smooth, semifluid, flowed easily at the mixing temperature, and retained a constant viscosity as the ingredients were added, thus enhancing the economic value of the base since the energy required for blending is minimized by these attributes. On cooling, no phase separation was observed and the base had excellent film forming attributes and could be used as a base for bubble gum. The gum base was also non tacky, chewed well, had a bland taste, and good organoleptic quality, i.e., mouth feel. Since there.was no filler included therein, the gum base can be used with acid sweeteners flavors. Just as with the SBR non filler base, the cooled base was soft and easily deformable, thus increasing the economic value thereof because of the reduced work energy required to mechnically masticate the soft base when preparing a chewing gum composition. Again, in order to demonstrate the surprising results of the present invention relative to yielding a soft base in the absence of filler and other components, such as hydrogenated vegetable oil, a sample of the polyisobutylene gum base and a sample of a commerciallyavailable polyisobutylene base were subjected to the hardness test as described herein relative to the styrenebutadiene gum base.A representative formula of the commercial base used herein, which is commercially available, is as follows Parts by WeightPolyisobutylene Base of the Gum Base Po lyisobutylene 8 148 PVAc High Molecular Weight 30 40 Filler 20 30 Waxes 8 15 Fatty Acid Esters 8 158 Softeners 0 5 Each of the samples were subjected to 3 to 5 runs each under the penetrometer, the mean value of penetration in 1 10 millimeters after 5 seconds at a constant load of 100 gms being determined to minimize the effect of anomalous results. Results of the comparative tests are set forth below in Table II. TABLE II Penetrometer Test Mean Penetration Measured After 5 Seconds Under ConstantSample Load of 100 gms. at 24.5 C From Example 14 31Commercial PIB Base 4.0 It is apparent from the data that the sample from Example 14 prepared according to the invention exhibited a degree of hardness an order of magnitude lower than the commercial PIB base even though the comparison sample included filler component which may be expected to cause discontinuity thus a softening effect in gum base. As explained hereinbefore, while the difference in softness of the gum base prepared in accordance with the invention is an order of magnitude greater, it is believed that gum base registering at least about 15 in accordance with the above test represents a significant advance in the art of producing gum bases the preferred softness measuring at least about 20 and most preferably at least about 25. EXAMPLE 15 A chewing gum composition was prepared utilizing the base of Example 14 according to the following formula. Parts by Weight ofIngredient the Chewing GumNovel PIB Gum Base as described in Example i4 24Sugar Pulverized 60Corn Syrup 430 Be 15Flavor 1 This chewing gum was found to have a soft texture, good bubble forming quality, and good organoleptic qualities, as well as having good shelf life. ISOBUTYLENE ISOPRENE COPOLYMER Butyl Rubber Elastomer Further experi.mentation included production of gum bases according to the invention which included properly plasticized isobutylene isoprene copolymer as the elastomer component. While butyl rubber is known to be used extensively as a base in stick gum which does not require a high degree of film forming attributes, the examples described below show that butyl rubber base including the excellent film forming high molecular weight polyvinyl acetate can be procuced by applying the principles set forth in the invention relative to proper external plasticization.Moreover, the base produced thereby was soft and essentially non tacky. EXAMPLE 16 An isobutylene isoprene copolymer gum base prepared as described below according to the following formula. Parts By WeightGum Base Ingredients of the Gum Base Elastomer ComponentIsobutylene Isoprene Copolymer Butyl Rubber 5Polylimonene 8 Resin ComponentPolyvinyl Acetate 20,000 40,000 65Glyceryl Triacetate 8Acetylated Monoglyceride 4 The ingredients were mixed in a Brabender plasticorder at a temperature of about 800C by first introducing the isobutylene isoprene copolymer, followed by a first part of the polyvinyl acetate, then the polylimonene, the remaining PVAc, glyceryl triacetate, and acetylated monoglyceride. The gum base was found to be smooth and semifluid, flowed easily at the mixing temperature, and retained a constant viscosity upon addition of the ingredients, thus enhancing the economic value of the base. No phase separation was observed on cooling and the base possessed good fiLn forming attributes and could be used as a bubble gum base, unlike previously known butyl rubber bases. The cooled base was soft and easily deformable which, again, markedly increases the economic value of the base because of the reduced work energy required to mechanically masticate the soft base when preparing a chewing gum composition. EXAMPLE 17 A chewing gum. composition was prepared utilizing the butyl rubber base of Example 16 according to the following formula.

A second portion of talc was then added with mixing. The gum base thereby formed was found to be smooth and fluid at 1100C. The base viscosity remained fairly constant as the ingredients were added. On cooling, no phase separation of ingredient was observed. The above gum base of the invention was non stick, chewed well, had a good mouth feel and a bland taste. Since the above base is free of CaCO3, it can be used with acid flavors and or acid sweetners, such as aspartame and the free acid form of saccharin. Further chewing gum compositions can be prepared from the novel gum bases disclosed herein as set forth below.
