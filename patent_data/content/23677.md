# Improvements in and relating to vehicle speed control systems.

## Abstract
A vehicle speed control system is described in which an electrical signal Vf representing actual vehicle speed is compared with a stored signal Vm representing desired vehicle speed. Any speed error is used in a servo loop 46, 16, 15, 10 to generate a control signal which tends to reduce the error to zero. In addition, signals Vs, Vm repre senting the actual and desired vehicle speeds are compared with a comparator 70 so as to produce a disabling signal when the difference between them falls outside predeter mined positive and negative limits e.g. because road condi tions prevent the vehicle engine from driving the vehicle at or close to the desired speed . This disabling signal is used to switch the control system out of operation.
