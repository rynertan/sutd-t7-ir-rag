## Description
OLEFIN DIERIZATION This invention relates to the production of an oil from a specific olefin. In another aspect, this invention relates to the synthesis of an oil having a low pour point and being useful in lubrication.Still another aspect of this invention is a new dimerization reaction.BACKGROUND OF THE ItWEt4TIOTt Hydrocarbon conversions and particularly the reactions of olefins constitute a very important section of the organic chemistry. The l oletins can be polymerized to high polymers, they can be alkylated to high octane fuels and they can be oligomerized to oils. Lubricating oils have been refined in recent years to match the increasing demands concerning their performance. Not only many additives have been developed for lubricating oils, but also entirely synthetic oils have been produced which exhibit special properties not found in oils produced from crude petroleum alone. One of the key features in many chemical reactions is the desired purity of the end product. This feature is particularly difficult to achieve in hydrocarbon conversion reactions. The larger the hydrocarbon molecules are, the more difficult it becomes to perform a reaction with only one or two reaction products resulting therefrom. Particularly, producing a hydrocarbon oil with a well defined molecular weight and structure is a continuing goal in the petrochemical industry. Such pure oils can then be used as such or blended into other mixtures with reproducible and reliable properties. Among the known hydrocarbon conversion reactions, dirrization is of particular interest here. Furthermore, the disproportionation metathesis reactions are important for this invention. Olefin oligomerization and particularly dimerization reactions are well known in the art. These reactions start from l olefins, i.e. hydrocarbons having a double bond at the end of a hydrocarbon chain. The dimerization reaction is normally carried out by contacting the l olefin with a dimerization catalyst. One known procedure utilizes for instance l decene and subjects it to an oligomerization in which dimers, trimers, and tetramers are produced with respectively 20, 30 and 40 carbon atoms in the molecule. One problem in this process is that a significant portion of each of these oligomers is produced and that the products therefore have a fairly wide spread of molecular weight.STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION It is an object of this invention to provide a new process for dimerizing a hydrocarbon with good selectivity. Another object of this invention is to provide a process for combining 4 olefin molecules with high selectivity into a desired oil compound. Yet another object of this invention is to provide a process for producing a hydrocarbon oil useful in lubrication from l olefins. Other objects, advantages, details, features and embodiments of this invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description of the invention and the appended claims. In accordance wit i a first embodiment of this invention a new hydrocarbon is provided which can be characterized as tetra n alkyl athylene having 28 to 44 carbon atoms per molecule with the proviso that the n alkyl radicals have 4 13 carbon atoms. The new composition of matter can also be characterized by the structural formulaEMI2.1 wherein Rl, R25 R3 and R4 are n alkyl radicals of 4 to 13 carbon atons. These new substituted ethylenes are oils that prior to and particularly after hydrogenation are useful as lubricating oils. In addition these substituted ethylenes are valuable intermediates for the production of other organic chemicals. The hydrogenated compounds are also believed to be novel composition and constitute another embodiment of this invention. These 1,1,2,2 tetra n alkyl ethanes having 28 44 carbon atoms per molecule can be characterized by the formula EMI3.1 wherein the radicals R1 R4 have the neaning defined above.The new compositions are as such useful as lubricating oils or can be blended with other ingredients to form lubricating oils. The preferred tetra substituted ethylenes and ethanes are those in which the n alkyl radicals R1 R4 have 6 9 carbon atoms. In accordance with a further embodiment of this invention it has been found that specific internal olefins can be converted into hydrocarbon oils with good selectivity to the desired oil by contacting these internal olefins with a promoted boron trifluoride catalyst under dimerization conditions. The present invention utilizes as the starting material for the dimerization process an internal olefin having the formula R CH CH R 1 In this formula, R and R can be the same or different and represent alkyl radicals having 4 to 12 carbon atoms. Another embodiment of this invention resides in a process to produce a mixture containing a hydrocarbon oil useful in lubrication from a l olefin. This process comprises essentially the following three steps a contacting at least one l olefin having the formula R CH CH2 2 wherein R has the same meaning as R and R above, with a disproportionation catalyst under disproportionation conditions. b The unreacted l olefins and the internal olefin of the formula 1 above are then separated. c The internal olefin of the formula 1 above thus separated and being essentially free of unreacted 1olefins is then contacted with a dimerization catalyst under dimerization conditions to form a mixture containing the desired hydrocarbon oil. Ideally, the process of this invention can be illustrated by the following formulae MetathesisEMI4.1 Dimerization EMI4.2 with two of the radicals R1,R2, R3, R4, selected from Ra, Rb, RC, Rd, and the other two of the radicals R1 R4 selected frail CH2 Ra, CH2 Rb, CH2 Rc, CH2 Rd. The number of carbon atoms in all four radicals R , Rub, RC, Rd together being equal to the number of carbon atoms in all radicals ofRT, R2 R35 and R4 together minus 2. Any U.S. patent referred to in this specification for further details consistent with this specification is insofar incorporated into this specification by reference.METATHESIS STEP In the disproportionation or metathesis step of the combined process of this invention alpha olefins can be used that have 6 to 14 carbon atoms. Examples for such olefins are hexene l, heptene l, octene l, nonene l, decene l, undecene1, and dodecene l. The octene, nonene, and decene homologs are particularly preferred. The normal isomers of these olefins are preferred, although small concentrations of branched isomers can be present. Branched alpha olefins reduce the viscosity index of the oil produced and hence are less desirable components of the starting material. The initial step of the combined process is the metathesis or disproportionation of alpha olefins to produce a larger internal olefin as follows CH2 CHR CH2 CHR C2Hg RCH CHR where R and R are alkyl radicals, preferably n alkyl radicals, having 4 to 12 carbon atoms. The preferred olefin feedstock is one in which R and R are the same. In this reaction it is very desirable to prevent or minimize isomerization of the double bond in the olefin product. If a small degree of isomerization in the metathesis should occur, it is contemplated that this will not shift the double bond by more than two carbon atoms. In other words, R in the internal olefin may have one or two carbon atoms more less than R of the starting l olefin, and correspondingly R in such an internal olefin will then have one or two carbon atoms less more than R of the starting l olefin, without leaving the scope of this invention. Consequently the metathesis reaction is preferably effected at a mild tcmperature, and with a catalyst useful under mild disproportionation conditions, such as one comprising an oxide of rhenium. U.S. patent 3,676,520 discloses such a catalyst. The presently preferred disproportionation catalyst in Re207 on alumina. The temperature for the metathesis reaction can be from about O 50 C preferably it will be between 20 30 C. The pressure for the metathesis reaction can be from about 0.01 to 2 atmospheres absolute 1 x 103 to 2 x 105 Pa . For convenience atmospheric pressure is preferred.These relatively low pressures permit continuous or frequent removal of the ethylene produced in the reaction. Without its removal the internal olefin can be cleaved to regenerate the alpha olefins via the reverse metathesis reaction. Olefin metathesis can be effected continuously or batchwise for this process the batchwise mode is preferred.Using a catalyst as disclosed in the above identified patent, the weight ratio of alpha olefin to catalyst can range from 1 1 to 100 1. The preferred ratio is about 10 1 to 50 1. It is generally impractical to convert all the alpha olefins because of reaction rates. However, contact time between catalyst and olefin for batchwise reaction can range between about 1 1000 hours preferably the contact time is 10 500 hours. If continuous metathesis is to be effected, catalyst and conditions disclosed in U.S. patents 3,658,927 and 3,586,731 can be used. The former teaches catalysts supported on alumina and the latter teaches catalysts supported on silica.These catalysts are treated with alkaline materials that reduce or destroy catalyst acidity that causes double bond isomerization as described in detail in U.S. patent 3,586,731.Use of the lower temperatures cited in these patents will help to minimize the undesirable isomerization. The metathesis catalyst is separated from the hydrocarbon product in a manner that is well known in the art. Such a separation is, for instance, described in theU.S. patent 3,558,518, col. 9. Other possibilities for separating the disproportionation catalyst from the hydrocarbons produced would be filtration or centrifugation where applicable. Olefin Separation Step Following alpha olefill metathesis, unreacted alpha olefins are separated from the internal olefin product of that reaction. Distillation provides a convenient way to make the separation and, unless the alpha olefins selected for the metathesis reaction contained too large a range of molecular weights, there will be a large break between the boiling point of the highest boiling alpha olefin and the lowest boiling internal olefin product. This separation of the alpha olefins from the internal olefins for the preferred embodiment of this invention utilizing olefins with 8 to 10 carbon atoms is thus carried out by distillation in which the end point for alpha olefins at atmospheric pressure is not above about 175 C and the initial boiling point ofthe internal olefin is not below about 235 C. The alpha olefin thus separated is preferably recycled to the metathesis step. Dimerization Step The separated product of the metathesis reaction which is essentially free of alpha olefins is converted by dimerization to compounds that are useful as lubricating oil basestock. The catalysts that can be used to effect dimerization, ar promoted boron trifluoride catalysts. The alcoholpromoted boron trifluoride catalysts are preferred. Preparation and use of such catalysts as are disclosed in U.S. patent 3,780,128, Col. 2, line 48 to Col. 5, line 15. The oligomerization of less reactive internal olefins in the invention is carried out at preferably higher temperatures than those disclosed in this patent.Although temperatures in the range 10 to 1500C can be used for dimerization, the preferred range is about 40 60 C. The other details concerning the catalyst composition and concentration, method of effecting the reaction, time and pressure of reaction, removal of catalyst, and hydrogenation of the resulting hydrocarbon to produce a synthetic lubricant base stock from U.S. patent 3,780,128 is applicable to this step of the invention process also, and is herewith incorporated by reference. The hydrocarbon oil produced as well as any unreacted internal olefin are then removed from the dimerization catalyst.This separation is done by conventional techniques such as those described in U.S. patent 3763, 44. Other methods to separate the hydrocarbons from the catalyst are filtering or centrifuging. Recovery and Purification of the Oil Product To obtain the desired physical properties in the synthetic lubricant it is frequently desirable to distill the mixture remaining after the dimerization step. The concentration of unreacted internal olefin is generally small but, after removal of the alcohol promoted boron trifluoride catalyst, it can be removed by distillation and returned to the dimerization process. In the preferred embodiment of this invention this distillation step is done by heating the hydrocarbon mixture to a temperature usually in the range of 3500C to 4O00C. The temperature is between the boiling point of the highest boiling internal olefin and the boiling point of the lowest boiling dimer of the internal olefins. Product having unacceptably high molecular weight preferably is removed by vacuum distillation. The hydrocarbon oil in this process is removed as the distillate whereas the undesirably high molecular weight product is removed as the bottom product from a distillation column. The vacuum distillation is usually carried out under a pressure of 0.01 torr to 100 torr preferably 1 5 torr, and by heating the product to obtain a product that has a corrected boiling point less than about 525 C. The thus purified and evaporated oil is recondensed and recovered. Prior to or after the vacuum distillation the oil produced is generally catalytically hydrogenated. This hydrogenation is done in a conventional procedure such as the one described in U.S. patent 2,270,303. Typical hydrogenation catalysts that can be used are Ni on alumina, cobalt molybdate on alumina, Pd, Pt, or Ru on alumina or carbon. but not acidic supports. The contacting of the oil produced with hydrogen and the hydrogenation catalyst is preferably carried out while the hydrocarbon oil is in the vapor phase as the distillate coming from the vacuum distillation for removing the high molecular weight product described above. Without undue limitation, the following examples describe further preferred details of this invention. Example 1 Metathesis of five different alpha olefin compositions was made. All runs started with l octene and or l decene which were contacted with 9 wt. Re2O7 on alumina catalyst.The quantities of the ingredients as well as the reaction conditions are shown in the following table. Before each run the catalyst was activated by heating in flowing air at 4500C for three hours, then flushed with nitrogen at that temperature for 20 minutes, and cooled. It was placed in an oven dried oxygen free flask which was then closed with a rubber serum closure. Measured quantities of alpha olefin were added to the flask and it was allowed to stand at ambient temperature about 25 C . During reaction the flask was vented via a hypodermic needle through the serum cap to permit ethylene produced in the metathesis reaction to escape. The product was separated from the catalyst by filtration.Table I summarizes the five runs, including the composition of the product as determined by gas liquid chromatography GLC at the times indicated.

About 8 wt. of C8 was also lost to the vacuum during the reaction period. The products anticipated from metathesis of these alpha olefins were produced with good selectivity at these conditions, namely, C14 from l octene, C18 fromi decene, and C14, C16, and C18 from mixtures of l octene and l decene. The concentration of olefins having odd carbon numbers, which result from undesirable double bond isomerization, is low. In runs I and VI the reaction mixture was analyzed at two different times. The results show that the reaction is not fast, but maintains its selectivity. Runs III andIV were made at reduced pressure run IV showed the highest alpha olefin conversion of all runs, at the relatively short reaction time of 40 hours. Reaction mixtures from metathesis of l octene and or l decene were subjected to distillation to separate the heavier metathesis product from the reactants.

The dimerization reactions were made in a glass flask as follows.To the flask that had been swept with nitrogen measured amounts of the olefin mixture plus light paraffinic hydrocarbon diluent and n propanol were added. The flask stood in a water bath on a hot plate, was fitted with a high speed stirrer, and was vented through a mercury manostat that permitted operation at about five cm.mercury above atmospheric pressure. Boron trifluoride was added as required to maintain the reaction pressure.Reaction was initiated by warning gently to about 40 C, and was maintained at or near that temperature during the run.At the end of the run the catalyst was separated in a separatory funnel from the hydrocarbon phase, and the latter was washed with about 200 ml of an aqueous solution of a base, e.g. 1.3 normal sodium hydroxide or preferably 5 normal ammonium hydroxide, to remove dissolved boron trifluoride.The hydrocarbon was dried over activated 3A molecular sieve, filtered, then distilled in vacuum to separate a 470 C fraction and a lube oil 410 510 C fraction The lubricating oil fraction of the distillate was hydrogenated, after dilution with 100 ml of n hexane, in an autoclave at 1600C for two hours at 2.9 x 1 6 Pa hydrogen pressure over 0.25g of 10t palladium on carbon catalyst. After hydrogenation the hexane diluent was removed by distillation and the resulting lubricating oil was inspected by standard methods for pertinent physical properties.

However selectivity to lubricating oil from the phosphoric acid catalyst was lower than with the n propanol catalyst. These results from the use of phosphoric acidboron trifluoride catalyst, which has for a long time been known to be active for olefin dimerization and polymerization show that the results when using an alcohol boron trifluoride catalyst are unexpectedly superior to those using the phosphoric acid promoted boron trifluoride catalyst for making a lubricating oil. Reasonable variations and modifications which will become apparent to those skilled in the art can be made fran this invention without departing from the spirit and scope thereof.
