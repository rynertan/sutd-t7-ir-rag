# PROCESS FOR PRODUCING POLY ALLYLAMINE DERIVATIVES

## Abstract
Poly allylamine salt of high polymerization degree is obtained in high yield by the polymerization of monoallyla mine salt with a specified radical polymerization initiator having in the molecule an azo group. Various poly allyla mine derivatives are obtained by reacting said poly allyla mine salt with cyanic acid salts, acrylic compounds, or formic acid and formaldehyde.
