# PROCESS FOR SEPARATING SOLIDS FROM COAL LIQUIDS

## Abstract
The rate of separation of suspended mineral particles from a coal liquid is increased by adding a calcium salt, such as calcium carbonate, to the coal liquid. The increase in the separation rate is achieved even though the suspended coal mineral particles naturally contain a calcium salt.
