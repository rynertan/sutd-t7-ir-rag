# Error compensated control system in a video signal processor.

## Abstract
A color television receiver or a color video monitor with luminance 14 and chrominance 16 signal channels in cludes an automatic kinescope beam current limiter 50 , an automatic white level drive control network 65 , and an automatic black level bias control network 75 . A switching network 51 is timed to operate such that a control signal developed by the beam current limiter is coupled to the luminance and chrominance channels during normal picture intervals, decoupled from the luminance channel during white level drive control intervals, and coupled to the chrominance channel during black level bias control inter vals. This allows the black level bias control network 75 to compensate for offset errors introduced by the beam current limiter.
