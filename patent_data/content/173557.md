## Description
PEPTIDES This invention relates to peptides for use as drugs, for example for use as diuretic agents, for use as therapeutic agents for the treatment of hypertension, for use as therapeutic agents for the treatment of heart disease, and for use as muscle relaxing agents. It is known that 95 of hypertension is essential hypertension and that half thereof is sodium sensitive hypertension. It is possible to control this type of hypertension by controlling the amount of sodium in the living body. It has been thought that, in the factors relevant to natriuretic action, there is an unknown humoral factor the third factor in addition to glomerular filtration rate and ardestone. In the third factor, there is involved one substance which inhibits Na K ATPase, and one substance which does not inhibit it. Therefore, it is to be expected that clarification of the above would give rise to an epoch making state of affairs relative to the cause and treatment of essential hypertension. Since the autumn of 1983, the establishment of the structure of natriuretic hormone as secreted from an atrium, one of the third factors i.e. the one withoutNa K ATPase inhibitory activity , has been reported many times. This substance possesses a strong natriuretic activity and a strong muscle relaxing activity.One of the natriuretic peptide hormones as isolated from humans iso human atrial natriuretic peptide abbreviated as A hANP having the following stuctural formulaEMI2.1 One of the natriuretic peptide hormones isolated from rat s atria is rat atrial natriuretic peptide cabbreviated as alpha rANP , having the following struc tural formula EMI2.2 For a long time, diuretic anti hypertensive drugs have been widely employed as a first choice drug for the treatment of patients with hypertension. However, recently, the side effects of such drugs, in causing heart disease, have been discovered and therefore, improvements in such drugs have been sought.Thus, the development of new drugs having less toxicity and more positive activity has been strongly desired by clinicians. The compound cA hANP is an endogeneous factor and a peptide, and therefor the safety thereof is presumed to be very high. However, on the other hand, because the fact that it is peptide, there are thought to be many problems in its developing as a drug, which problems include the fact that it undergoes decomposition with peptidase, the fact that the duration of its activity is short,and the fact that it has an unstable nature. The inventors of the present invention have devised compounds related to d hANP, for use as drugs for peptide circulating systems. According to the present invention, there is provided a peptide having the general formula EMI3.1 wherein X is Met, Met O , Nle or Ile EMI3.2 is a cystine residue or an alpha amino suberic acid residue Z is Gly orAla m, n and p are the same or different and each is 0 or 1 A is Ser, Ser Ser, Arg Ser Ser, Arg Arg Ser Ser,Leu Arg Arg Ser Ser or Ser Leu Arg Arg Ser Ser and B is Asn, Asn Ser,Asn Ser Phe, Asn Ser Phe Arg orAsn Ser Phe Arg Tyr but excluding the following peptides oc hANP 1 28 d rANP 1 28 alpha rANP 4 28 i rANP 5 27 alpha rANP 5 25 oc rANP 3 28 . In the above formula,EMI3.3 is a cystine residue, or an Amino suberic acid residue Asu , i.e. the following residues, respectivelyEMI3.4 When the peptides of the present invention possess one or more functional groups such as amino groups, carboxyl groups, hydroxyl groups or guanidyl groups , a part or all of the functional groups may be protected by a protecting group used in methods for peptide synthesis or generally or conventionally employed in the known literature These derivatives are included in the peptides of the present invention. For the methods for the protection thereof and the methods for removal of the protecting groups, conventional means for peptide synthesis may be employed. Examples of the peptides of the present invention are as follows alpha hANP 5 28 EMI4.1 o hANP 7 28 EMI4.2 CL hANP 5 27 EMI4.3 i hANP 5 25 EMI4.4 Nle12 hANP 1 28 EMI5.1 Met O 12 hANP 1 28 EMI5.2 Asu7,23 alpha hANP 7 23 EMI5.3 The amino acids constituting the peptide derivatives of the present invention may be L isomers orD isomers. The peptides of the present invention may be in the form of a salt, such as a metal salt for example a sodium, potassium, lithium or calcium salt or a salt with an organic base. As the organic base, there can be used amines such as ammonia ammonium salt , dicyclohexylamine, and N methyl D glucamine, and basic amino acids such as lysine and arginine. The peptides of the present invention may be in the form of a salt with a mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid or phosphoric acid or with an organic acid such as acetic acid or maleic acid . When the peptides are included in drugs such as diuretics, they are in a form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or in free form. In the case of protected derivatives, these derivatives should be nontoxic.
