# PROGRAMMABLE FUNCTIONAL ELECTRICAL STIMULATION SYSTEM

## Abstract
A muscle stimulator system produces an electrical output pulse train which provides functional electrical sti mulation FES of muscles or muscle groups. The muscle stimulator system inludes a clinical device which can be programmed using the clinical device . In addition, external memory modules are provided to store the FES regimens established in the clinical device during the PROGRAM mode. The clinical device is capable of retrieving the FES regimens from the external memory module. The personal device includes a manually operated amplitude control which provides an amplitude control signal for controlling the amplitude of the output pulse train.
