## Description
NOVEL 17 AMINO 16 HYDROXY STEROIDS OF THE ANDROSTANEAND OESTRANE SERIES AND DERIVATIVES THEREOF, PROCESSESFOR THEIR PREPARATION AND PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS. This invention relates to novel 17 amino 16 hydroxy steroids of the androstane and oestrane series and derivatives thereof, to processes for their preparation and to pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds as active component. In British Specification 1 108 563 amino steroids of the androstane, oestrane and pregnane series are described, having a hydroxyl or acyloxy group in 2B position and a tertiary amino group in 3a position.Some of these compounds have been found to possess anti arrhythmic activity. However, at therapeutic dose levels these compounds also exhibit undesirable activities, such as convulsant activity and local anaesthetic activity which precludes their clinical application. In British Specification 1 439 605 amino steroids of the androstane, oestrane and pregnane series are described, having a hydroxyl or acyloxy group in 20 position and a primary amino group in 3w position. These compounds have anti arrhythmic properties and are virtually devoid of convulsant and local anaesthetic activities. Surprisingly, it was found that novel steroids of the androstane and oestrane series, substituted in 17 position with a primary, secondary or tertiary amino group and in 16 position with a free, esterified or etherified hydroxyl group, are potent anti arrhythmic agents. Therefore, the present invention relates to novel steroids of the androstane and oestrane series having the formula I EMI2.1 and pharmaceutically acceptable non toxic acid addition salts thereof, wherein R1 H or hydrocarbyl of one to six C atoms, preferably lower alkyl, such as methyl R2 H or hydrocarbyl of one to six C atoms, preferably lower alkyl, such as methyl R3 a free, esterified or etherified hydroxyl group, ring A inclusive carbon atoms 6 and 9 has one of the following conficurations EMI2.2 in whichR4 a free, esterified or etherified hydroxyl group R5 O or H R7 , wherein R7 is a free, esterified or etherified hydroxyl group R6 H or methyl and the dotted lines represent an oPtional double bond in 4,5 or 5,6 position as well as the enantiomers of these compounds and racemic mixture thereof. The invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing a pharmaceutically effective amount of one or more of the novel compounds indicated hereinbefore. A special group of compounds is the group having formula II EMI3.1 and pharmaceutically acceptable non toxic acid addition salts thereof, wherein R8 H or methyl, and is preferably methyl Rg H or methyl, and is preferably H R10 H or lower alkanoyl of one to four carbon atoms, and is preferably H, while OR10 is preferably in a position rinq A has one of the followinq confiqurations EMI3.2 in whichR11 OH, alkanoyloxy 1 6 C or Oalkyl 1 4 C , preferablyOH R12 H or CH3 R13 O, H ssOH or H ss alkanoyloxy 1 4 C , preferably 0 as well as the enantiomers and racemates. The novel compounds have antiarrhythmic properties, have no or minimal and transient haemodynamic effects, and do not cause CNS stimulation in the dosages required.They also have prophylactic effect and decrease infarctsize. The compounds according to the invention can be prepared by methods employing steps known or obvious to those skilled in the art. The methods generally comprise the use of 16,17 epoxides as starting materials or intermediates, the a epoxides leading in general to 17B aminocompounds and the ss epoxides to 17 amino compounds. These methods generally give the trans amino alcohols, i.e. 17a amino 16ss hydroxy and 176 amino 16 hydroxy compounds. The 17ss amino 16a hydroxy compounds can be converted into the F cis amino alcohols, i.e. 17ss amino 16ss hydroxy compounds, by an oxidation reduction sequence, wherein 16a hydroxy is first oxidized to 16 oxo, which group is then reduced to 16ss hydroxy with a complex metal hydride such as sodium borohydride.However, also other routes for preparing the compounds of the present invention are available, details of which will be indicated below. The 16a,17a epoxides to be used as starting materials may be prepared, for example, from the corresponding 17 ketones by enol acylation and treating the thus obtained A16 l7 acyloxy steroid with a peracid, such as peracetic acid, perphtalje acid or perbenzoic acid, so as to obtain a 16a,17a epoxy 17ss acylate. The enol acylation can be performed, for example, by reacting the 17 ketone with a isopropenyl acylate, such as isopropenyl acetate, in the presence of an acid catalyst. Esterifiable hydroxyl groups, which may be present elsewhere in the molecule, for example a 3 hydroxy group, areesterified simultaneously with the enol acylation. The 16ss,17ss epoxides to be used as starting materials may be prepared, for example, from the corresponding A16 compounds via the halohydrine by reacting the A16 compound with an organic N halo compound, e.g. N bromo acetamide or N chloro succinimide, in a suitable solvent such as dimethylsulphoxide and converting the 17a halo 16ss hydroxy compound thus obtained with alkali, e.g. potassium hydroxide, into the 16ss,17ss epoxide. A 16a,17a epoxy 17ss acylate is rearranged to the corresponding 16a acyloxy 17 ketone, for example with perchloric acid in acetic acid. The 16a acyloxy17 ketone is reacted with ammonia or an alkylamine in a suitable solvent, e.g. ethanol, to give the corresponding 16a acyloxy 17 imino or 16a acyloxy17 alkylimino compound, which is then reduced with a complex metal hydride, preferably sodium borohydride, to give the 17ss amino 16a hydroxy or the 17ss alkylamino 16a hydroxy compound.By reacting a 16a acyloxy 17 ketone with hydroxyl amine in a suitable solvent, e.g. ethanol, preferably in the presence of sodium acetate, the 16a acyloxy 17oxime is obtained, which by hydrogenetaion, preferably in the form of the acetylated derivative, the 17 acetoxime, is converted into the corresponding 17ss amino 16a hydroxy compound. Hydrogenation, preferably under pressure, of the 17 acetoxime gives the 1,7ss acetamide, which on hydrolysis gives the 17amino compound. The reduction of the 17 acetoxime can also be performed with diborane in tetrahydrofuran, followed by alkaline hydrolysis of the intermediate 17ss acetamide to the 17amino compound. For obtaining the 17P alkyl amino 16ss hydroxy compound the 17ss alkyl amino 16a hydroxy compound is oxidized, preferably with Kiliani reagent in acetic acid, to the corresponding 16 ketone, which is then reduced with sodium boro hydride to give the 17ss alkyl amino l6p hydroxy compound. The Kiliani oxidation is preferably carried out with the alkyl amino compound in its acylated form. Acylation of the 17ss alkyl amino 16 hydroxy compound provides the Ip acyl alkyl amino 16a acetate, which on selective hydrolysis with alkali gives the 17ss acyl alkyl amino 16a hydroxy compound.After the oxidation and reduction step the 17ss acyl alkyl amino l6ss hydroxy compound is hydrolyzed with alkali to the 17ss alkyl amino 16ss hydroxy compound. As described above, the reaction of a 16a acyloxy17 ketone with ammonia in ethanol gives a 17 imino compound. On reduction with sodium borohydride a mixture of 17ss amino 16a hydroxy and 17a amino 16ahydroxy compounds is obtained. This mixture can be separated by conversion to a mixture of the acid addition salts with hydrochloric acid, from which the water insoluble 17a amino 16 hydroxy hydrochloride can be isolated easily. Treatment with alkali, e.g.a saturated potassium hydrogen carbonate solution, gives the free base. The 17a amino 16a hydroxy compounds can also be prepaid by starting from a 16 steroid, converting said steroid into the 16a,17a aziridine by reaction with N p nitrobenzene sulphonoxy urethane in the presence of triethylamine and hydrolysis of the thusobtained 16a,l7a carbethoxy azisidine, converting the 16q,17a aziridine into its acylate, such asthe N acetyl or N benzoyi derivative, rearranging theN acyl aziridine with sodium iodide acetone to the corresponding 16 alpha ,17 alpha oxazoline and hydrolyzing this with acid, e.g. diluted sulphuric acid, to the 17a amino 16 hydroxy compound in the form of its acid addition salt. Neutralisation with base gives the free 17a amino 16a hydroxy compound. When starting from a 16ss,17ss epoxide, this compound is reacted with an alkali metal azide to give the corresponding 17a azido 168 hydroxy compound, which is converted into the 17a amino 16ss hydroxy steroid by reduction, e.g. with hydrogen in the presence of a metal catalyst and preferably with lithium aluminiumhydride. A 17 methylamino compound can readily be prepared from the corresponding 17 amino compound byN formylation, e.g. by reacting with ethylformate in ethanol in the presence of sodium ethoxide, followed by reduction of the 17 formamido steroid thus obtained, e.g. with a complex metal hydride, preferably with lithium aluminiumhydride in tetrahydrofuran. A 17 dimethylamino compound can be obtained by repeating the above N formylation and reduction on a 17 methylamino compound. Also, direct conversion of a 17 methylamino compound into a 17 dimethylamino compound is possible by methylation with formic acid formal in. A 17 isopropylamino compound can be prepared as indicated hereinbefore by condensation of a 16 acyloxy 17 ketone with isopropylamine and reduction of the intermediate 17 imino compound with a complex metal hydride. A 17 isopropylamino compound can also be prepared by heating a 16a hydroxy 170 amino compound with acetone at reflux temperature for e.g. 3 days, affording the intermediate 17 isopropylidene imino compound which can be reduced with a complex metal hydride to the desired 17ss isopropylamino 16 hydroxy compound.Another route to this 17ss isopropylamino compound is the alkylation of a 16a hydroxy 170 amine with iodopropane in a suitable solvent, such as dimethylformamide, in the presence of potassium bicarbonate, usually at room temperature for several days, e.g. 4 days. The substituents in position 3 and the double bond s in ring A or ring B may be present in the starting substances or may be introduced after the introduction of the vicinal amino hydroxy substituents in ring D. For preparing A or A compounds the double bond in 4,5 or 5,6 position is usually already present in the starting substances, e.g. 3ss,16 di acetoxy A5 androsten 17 one or 16 alpha acetoxy 4 androstene 3,17 dione, which is then reacted as described hereinbefore to give via the 17 imino compound the corresponding 17ss alkyl amino 16a hydroxy steroid. An endproduct having a 3ss hydroxy A5 group can be easily converted in an endproduct having a 3 oxo A4 group, e.g. by Oppenauer oxidation. Another route for obtaining the 4 and 5 compounds is starting from dehydro epiandrosterone acetate, protecting the double bond in 5,6 position in the form of the dichloride addition of chlorine to give the 5a,6p dichloro compound and then subjecting the 5a,6ss dichloro compound to a reaction sequence as described hereinbefore, e.g. enolacylating in 16,17 position, reacting the enol acylate with peracetic acid in chloroform to give the l6,l7a epoxy 17 acetate, rearranging the epoxy acetate withBF3 etherate in toluene to give the corresponding 16 alpha acetoxy 17 ketone, which is then reacted as described to give via the 17 imino compound the corresponding 5 alpha ,6ss dichloro 17ss alkyl amino 16 alpha hydroxy steroid.Treatment of the dichloro compound with zinc dust in ethanol regenerates the 5 compound.Reaction of the 5a,6ss dichloro 3 hydroxy compound with lithiumchloride heating for 3 hours at 110 C in dimethylformamide provides the corresponding A4 3 ketone. A 4 3 ketone can readily be converted into a A1,4 3 ketone by conventional dehydrogenation procedures, e.g. reaction with selenium dioxide or with a suitable quinone such as dichlorodicyanobenzoquinone. A very convenient procedure is the dehydrogenation with diphenylselenic anhydride in a solvent such as chloro benzene, while temporarily protecting a primary or secondary 17 amino group by acylation, preferably with trifluoro acetic anhydride in pyridine. In all methods for preparing the novel compounds any hydroxy group in position 3 and or 16 if present , an oxo group in position 3 if present , and the alkyl amino group in position 17 are temperarily protected, if required, by reversible ester or ether formation hydroxy group , reversible acetalformation oxo group or reversible acyl , carbamateor salt formation amino group . Protection of the 17 alkyl amino group in the form of the carbamate thereof can be performed by treatment of the 17 alkyl amine with alkyl or arylhaloformate, such as benzylchloroformate, giving the corresponding alkyl or arylcarbamate.Decarboxylation can be performed by hydrogenolysis in a suitable solvent, such as acetic acid or methanol, over a noble metal, e.g. palladium, on carbon, to give back the 17 alkyl amine. A hydroxy group may be acylated according to procedures well known in the art, e.g. by reaction with an organic carboxylic acid or a functional derivative thereof, such as the anhydride or the acid chloride, in the presence of a water binding agent or a base, such as pyridine. Acyl groups, if present in the 3 and or 16position or in the amino group may be hydrolyzed, e.g. with alkali, to give the free hydroxy or amino group. A hydroxy group, if present in the 3 position of a A4, A5 or 5aH compound, may be oxidized to the corresponding oxo group by known methods, e.g. with chromic acid in the presence of sulphuric acid or with the Oppenauer method. A 3 oxo group, if present, may be reduced to a 3hydroxy group, e.g. with NaBH4 or LiAlH4. An acyl group, if present in 3 and or 16position, may be derived from an aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, aromatic or araliphatic carboxylic acid with 1 18 carbon atoms, such as acetic acid, propionic acid, pentanoic acid, trimethyl acetic acid, heptanoic acid, decanoic acid, dodecanoic acid, benzoic acid, ss phenyl propionic acid, cyclo octyl acetic acid, succinic acid, and the like. A hydroxy group, if present in the 3 and or 16 position may be converted into an ether group derived from an aliphatic, aromatic, araliphatic or heterocyclic hydrocarbon, such as the methyl, ethyl, butyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, tetrahydro pyranyl ether group, and the like, according to well known procedures. An ether group used for protection, such as for example a tetrahydropyranyl ether group in 16 position, can be split up under acid conditions. Also acetal groups used for protection of an oxo group, such as the ethylene dioxy or the di methyloxy group in position 3, can easily be split up by treatment with a mineral acid or a sulphonic acid at room temperature or by being gently heated with dilute acetic acid. The preparation of the acid addition salts of the 17 amino compounds of the invention can be performed by treatment of the amino compound with an inorganic acid such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid, or an organic acid, such as citric acid, pyruvic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, sulphonic acids. The enantiomers of the compounds of formula I can be prepared according to the same methods as described hereinbefore for the natural isomers, starting from the enentiomeric starting substances, i.e. ent epiandrosterone, ent oestrone and the like.Racemates of the compounds of formula I are obtained starting from racemic starting substances, e.g.dl oestrone. These 1 and dl steroids used as starting substances are known in the art and are prepared by total synthesis. Racemic mixtures of intermediates or endproducts may be resolved to give the optical antipodes in the usual way, e.g. by chromatography or crystallization. The new compounds according to the invention may be used in the form of pharmaceutical compositions, for which purpose they are mixed with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable non toxic carriers and or the usual excipients suitable for enteral, i.e. oral, administration or for parenteral administration, e.g.for injection. The effective oral dose is in the range from 0.5 25 mg kg and the effective intravenous dose is in the range from 0.1 10 mg kg. The following examples illustrate the invention.
