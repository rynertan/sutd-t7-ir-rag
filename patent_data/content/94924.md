# ARTICLES EXHIBITING A BIOCOMPATIBLE SURFACE LAYER AND PROCESS FOR PROVIDING ARTICLES WITH SUCH A SURFACE LAYER

## Abstract
A process for providing a surface of glass, silicon, aluminium or silicone rubber of an article useful within medicine with a biocompatible surface layer. Said surface is reacted after oxidation when required with a silane contain ing at least one epoxy group and the surface thus treated is then reacted with a polysaccharide containing at least one hydroxyl group. The invention also relates to an article exhibiting a biocompatible surface layer of a polysaccharide containing at least one hydroxyl group, which polysacchar ide is covalently bound to a surface of glass, silicon, aluminium or silicone rubber of the article by means of a silane.
