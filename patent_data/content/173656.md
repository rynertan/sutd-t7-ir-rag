# Method and apparatus for welding thin metal sheets.

## Abstract
There is decribed a method for welding thin metal sheets A, B by the localised heating of limited juxtaposed zones of the metal sheets to be welded to cause their fusion and to form spot welds S . In each weld zone, the metal sheets A, B are heated and fused along a closed line so that each weld spot S has a substantially annular configuration in cross section in a plane parallel to the metal sheets. This welding may be achieved for example with the use of a laser 2 produced by a laser source 1 , or by electrical resistance welding with a pair of opposed electrodes 6, 7 the ends whereof which are intended to grip the metal sheets A, B are suitably shaped.
