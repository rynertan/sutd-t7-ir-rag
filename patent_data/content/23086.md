## Description
METHOD OF TREATING SCRUBBER SLUDGE AND MIXTURES PRODUCED BY THE METHOD The present invention relates to a method for treating the waste sludge removed from SO containing gas scrubbers and the mixtures produced thereby which mixtures are useful as suitable structural material, especially in land reclamation projects. The mixtures of the present invention exhibit excellent dimensional stability and have high structural strength. The low permeability and the non leachability characteristics of the mixtures make them suitable for use as embankments, dikes, pond liners, bridge abutments, etc. Further, a method for improving the dewatering characteristics of an aqueous waste sludge is provided. The use of coal as a fuel in electric generator plants is well known. In recent times, emphasis upon the burning of coal for this purpose has been increasing due to the dependence of this country on foreign sources for oil, the relative scarcity of oil, and the high price thereof. As the emphasis has shifted to the use of coal fuel, considerable opposition to its use, especially to the use of high sulfur content fuel has steadily increased.Opponents of the use of coal rely upon the deleterious effects that SOx emission resulting from the combustion of the coal into the atmosphere have on the environment. Generally, two approaches have been used to counter the problem of excess SO emissions. The first has been to provide elaborate off gas scrubbing units in combination with the coal boiler or furnace in coal combustion systems, usually in pulverized coal combustion systems The more generally accepted systems utilize lime or limestone as preferred sorbents. These devices wash the gas and absorb the sulfur oxides, producing a slurry or sludge that contains the sulfur oxide in the form of calcium sulfite and calcium sulfate. Some of the sorbent material that is currently in use contains other ingredients such as dolomitic lime and or proprietary additives. Generally, the commercial applications are based on the use of either finely ground calcium carbonate limestone or a suspension of calcium hydroxide which is produced from high calcium quick lime. Commonly, the waste sludges produced by the aforementioned scrubbers contain a high proportion of relatively inert fine particulate matter and a variety of reactive materials in sufficiently small concentrations as to make the reclamation thereof uneconomical. These reactive compounds in the sludge solids include common materials such as sulfate ions, calcium ions, aluminium ions, and iron ions or sources thereof, The water content of such sludges may vary considerably and is typically in the range of 80 90 by weight. The disposition of such sludges has always been a problem. With the increasing awareness of the undesirability of discharging such waste material into the environment and the resulting government regulations of such discharges, the need for a convenient, harmless, and economical way of disposing of such sludges or converting them into a useful product is becoming increasingly apparent. A further incentive is provided by the capital investment and land required for the disposition of such sludges by conventional means, which often include large settling ponds or storage piles, In most cases, the sludge, prior to any chemical modification for disposal purposes, is subjected to a dewatering process whereby the liquid content of the sludge is decreased by means of a centrifuge and or vacuum filter.Heretofore, sludge with high sulfite content has been extremely difficult to dewater to a commercially acceptable extent.In this regard, it has been common commercial practice to add various compounds to the sludge to effect oxidation of the sulfite to sulfate, which latter radical lends itself to better dewatering. Also, other attempts to dewater high sulfite content sludge have included the addition of certain polymeric substances to the sludge. Another solution to the problem of excess SO emission in coal combustion systems has been to provide a fluidized combustion bed of lime or limestone in which the coal is ignited. Preferably, the coal is pulverized and also floats within this fluidized bed during the ignition thereof. The suspended lime or limestone particles thus absorb substantial amounts of the oxidized sulfur content of the coal in the form of anhydrous sulfates. After the spent fluidized bed combustion residue has been removed from the coal boiler or furnace, problems with respect to the disposal thereof have been presented due to the above mentioned governmental regulations pertaining to protection of the environment, and, also due to the fact that the spent residue has heretofore been thought useful for few practical applications. In my paper entitled Development of PotentialUses for the Residue from Fluidized Bed Combustion Process ,FE 2549 3, I have suggested that fluidized bed combustion residue be used FBCR , inter alia, in the production of road base material, as a sorbent in gas scrubbers, and as a means for stabilizing scrubber sludge when fly ash is also added to a combination of the sludge residue. In my paper entitled Development of PotentialUses for the Residue from Fluidized Bed Combustion Processes ,FE 2549 6, I have suggested, inter alia, that a wet blunging pretreatment of the fluidized bed combustion residue is useful as a means of liberating the lime component of the residue and that the compressive strength of scrubber sludge may be increased by mixing of the residue, sludge, and fly ash in certain proportions. The use of FBCR sorbents and FBCR sludge mixtures has not been without problems however. For instance, when the entire FBCR fraction is charged into a scrubber as a sorbpnt, the solids content of the sorbent is dramatically increased, causing mechanical problems due to the relatively large particle size of various components of the FBCR.Also, when an entire blunged FBCR fraction is used in sludge mixtures, dewatering problems have occurred due to the large available lime content of the residue, which lime slakes and is difficult to settle. Accordingly, despite the foregoing, there remains a need for a method in which scrubber sludges can be converted into stabilized structural material for use as reclamation material in a commercially acceptable and economic fashion. Also, there remains a need for a method in which the efficiency of conventional sludge dewatering techniques is improved. Further, despite the foregoing, there remains a specific need for a method for utilizing fluidized bed combustion residue in an environmentally acceptable manner. Of further importance is the need to provide a relatively inexpensive source of sorbent material in SO gas x scrubbers, due to the ever increasing costs of lime and limestone, which are conventionally used as SO sorbent. x These and other objects are met by the present invention. In accordance with the invention, the precipitate from an agitated slurry of fluidized bed combustion residue is added to waste scrubber sludge in order to provide a novel composition useful in reclamation projects. If added prior to sludge dewatering, the residue precipitate acts as a filter aid and also undergoes certain hydration reactions to chemically bond water from the sludge, thus increasing the solids content of the sludge. If desired, the supernatant liquor separated from the fluidized bed combustion residue slurry may be fed into a SOx scrubber as a sorbent to absorb substantial amounts of SO in the waste gas. This latter facet of the invention provides distinct economic advantage as it provides a relatively inexpensive source of lime for use as a sorbent. According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of treating scrubber sludge removed from a gas scrubbing apparatus of the type adapted to reduce SO content in the treated gas which comprises the x steps of a collecting the spent residue from a fluidized combustion bed of the type in which lime or limestone particles are suspended in a fluidized medium, and a carbonaceous fuel is ignited proximate said fluidized medium to capture therein substantial amounts of SO which is generated upon ignition of said carbonaceous fuel b separating substantial amounts of the lime component of said fluidized bed combustion residue from said residue thereby leaving a precipitate material and c mixing the precipitate with waste scrubber sludge.Preferably, the separating step comprises mixing the fluidized bed combustion residue in slurry and separating the supernatent liquor from the precipitate portion of said slurried residue, and conveniently, the method of the present invention further comprises the step of taking the separated supernatent liquor and injecting it into a gas scrubbing apparatus of the type adapted to remove sub stantial amounts of SO from the gas treated therein, and washing said treated gas with said supernatant liquor.Normally, about 1 part or 2 parts by weight of sludge is mixed with about 1 part by weight of said precipitate.With advantage, the method of the present invention further comprises adding fly ash to the precipitate sludge mix, the amount by weight, of precipitate, fly ash, and sludge in the mix conveniently being presented in the ratio 1 1 1 or 1 1 2.Optionally, the method of the present invention comprises the step of dewatering the precipitate sludge mixture subsequent to step c . The precipitate sludge mixture may be used as a reclamation material According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a composition comprising scrubber sludge removed from a gas scrubbing apparatus of the type adapted to reduce the SO content of the waste gas x treated therein, and a precipitate material derived by taking the precipitate from an agitated slurry of fluidized bed combustion residue. Optionally the composition further comprises fly ash. Conveniently, in the compositions of the present invention the relative proportion, by weight, of the precipitate to to the scrubber sludge is about 1 1 or about 1 2, and if fly ash is present, the relative proportion, by weight, of the precipitate, fly ash and sludge is conveniently of the order of 1 1 1 or 1 1 2. Preferably the precipitate material in the compositions of the present invention comprises the oxides of silicon, iron, aluminium and magnesium, calcium sulfate, calcium carbonate, or calcium hydroxide. Fluidized bed combustion residues used for purposes of my invention vary slightly in physical and chemical makeup from one boiler plant location to another. As the combustion beds of most of these plants are operated at temperatures below about 16000F 87l0C and since the fluidized bed combustion residue is, in most cases, not rapidly quenched after ignition of the pulverized coal, the spent and collected residue comprises mostly crystalline compounds, in contrast to the production of amorphous combustion by products which may be formed by higher heat treatment and rapid residue quenching. Also, at most plants a stochiometric excess of the lime or limstone needed for combustion of the coal is provided in the fluidized bed. Various residues from different fluidized bed coal combustion system locations were subjected to different tests to determine the engineering properties as well as the chemical constituency thereof. For instance, the physical properties of the fluidized bed combustion residue taken from one boiler plant location are provided in Table I. TABLE I ENGINEERING PROPERTIES 1.

However, the grain size analysis, dry ridded weight and loose weight determinations were performed ondry as received residue. The general soil description of the fluidized bed combustion residue from the first noted plant location, based on the gradation and plasticity characteristics, is that of a uniformly graded sand. The AASHTO designation isA l b. The Unified Soil Classification System ascribes the letter designation SP for a poorly graded sand. Due to the friable nature of the residue, the classification could shift to SM for a silty sand after compactor forces are applied during placement of the residue in a fill. The loose and dry rodded weights of the residue are somewhat lower in value than natural sand, but the direct shear and permeability data are more typical of a silty sand.

These characteristics are more pronounced as the particle size increases up to a 84 mesh material.The larger grains are flatter and subsequently subangular to a greater extent. The 8 mesh and larger material is reasonably sound and resistant to mechanical abrasion with finger pressure. Material passing through a 8 mesh sieve is readily friable, producing a light brown powder. Coloration of the residue from the first plant on the whole is heterogeneous and varies from sample to sample, but, in general, the plus 8 mesh material is uniformly reddish brown and similar to a red shell, while the intermediate particle sizes are brighter with a reddish hue speckled with black carbon and white particles. The fines are variable due to the lower percentage of fines available.

When the resulting quicklim component is subjected to the sulphur dioxide emanating from the combusted coal and to the molecular oxygen existing in the combustion air, an anhydrous calcium sulfate reaction product is forced by the following reaction EMI17.2 The CaSO4 anhydrite is formed about the ou er surface of the CaO particles and thus forms a shell which encapsulates the quicklime CaO .The thickness of this shell is dictated by the length of exposure of the quicklim to the SO2. If the CaO particle in the bcd is small, the resulting reaction particle will be comprison of substantially all CaSO4 anhydrite.On the other hand, and as is the case in most instances, the resulting reaction produce will comprise spheres of anhydrous CaSO4, with etch sphere encapsulating a CaO quicklime core component. This factor distinguishes FBCR from other lime reaction products and provides a problem in that the CaSO shells must be broken before the quicklime component of the residue can be released. In accordance with the invention, after collection of the spelt residue, it is slurried with water slurry comprising about 5 20 wt. solids in a lightning mixer which provides for mechanical agitation of the slurry.This treatment is hereinafter referred to as 11blunging and results in an overall fracturing of the CSO. shells, a reduction in particle size, and a liberation cind hydration of the free lime component of the residue accompanied incidentally by substantial heat generation.This blunging treatment is usually performed for a period of about 10 15 minutes. The blunging treatment is an effective way of separating out most of the lime components of the FBC residue as the supernatant liquor from the slurry is pumped off, leaving a particulate precipitate material. Settling of the supernatant liquor fraction of the slurry results in the recovery of approximately 15.3 solids. In one aspect of the invention, the supernatant liquor separated from the slurry is then fed as a sorbent into a conventional gas scrubbing apparatus of the type adapted to reduce the SO content of the gas treated therein. Since the supernatant liquor fraction of the slurry consists essentially of hydrated lime, this liquor provides an inexpensive source of line to be utilized in vonventional scrubber applications. The chemical analysis of the precipitate material, separated from a slurry of the third plant location residue is shown in Table VII. Although the blunging technique is preferred as a means of liberating the quicklime component of the residue, other methods may also be suitably employed. For instance, slakers, hydraters, Diester tables, and other wet separation techniques may be used. The important factor is that substantial amounts of the quicklime should be separated, leaving a particulate precipitate which consists essentially of the compounds specified in Table VII. This residue precipitate is then mixed in desired proportion with the aqueous waste sludge emanating from a SO gas scrubbing system of the type wherein a timing aqent x is fed through the boiler gas scrubbing operation as a slurry to capture the sulfur oxides and convert them to sulfites and or sulfates.

The waste sludge from said boiler comprised approximately 40 solids after passing through a thickening procedure. Accordingly, due to the aqueous nature of the waste sludge, the sludge and the FBC residue precipitate material may be directly combined simply by mixing, Further fly ash may be incorporated into the mix if desired.As is known in the art, fly ash comprises the collected, particulate offproduct ash which usually accompanies the flue gas in pulverised coal burning combu tion systems. Basically, the fly ash comprises the oxides of silica, aluminium and iron. The fly ash is usually collected by means of a bag house or electrostatic precipitators.

As utilized herein, all proportions given are by weight, unless otherwise specified. It was noted that all samples provided stable materials useful in land reclamation projects.The samples indicate that the sludge FBCR precipitate mixture may be successfully utilized in reclamation projects, as the traditionally accepted minimum compressive strength for such purposes is about 2,500 psf. In accordance with another aspect of the invention, proportions of aqueous waste sludge and the FBCR precipitate are mixed prior to dewatering of the sludge by centrifuge or vacuum filter techniques. The particulate precipitate migrates throughout the sludge allowing water to more readily run off. Further, due to the anhydrous nature of the CaSO4 constituent of the FBCR precipitate, water of hydration is removed from the sludge due to the crystallization of the anhydrite.EMI24.1 One such test employing equal percentages by weight ofFBCR precipitate and sludge has been undertaken whereby the precipitate has been proven effective as a sludge dewatering aid. EXAMPLE 2 Six 200 gram sludge samples were tested to ascertain the dewatering effectiveness of the FBCR precipitate material. With the exception of the control sample, varying amounts by weight of the precipitate were added to the samples prior to the vacuum dewatering of each sample by a vacuum filtration technique wherein 30 p.s.i. 21,092 kg mê of pressure was utilized as the suction force.The results are shown in Table X TABLE X MOISTURE CONTENT OF VARIOUS FBCR PRECIPITATE MIXTURES MIX FBCR PRECIPITATE SOLIDS PRIOR SOLIDS AFTER ADDED TO DEWATERING DEWATERING , by weight Control 0 10 42.15 1 2 12 45.45 2 5 15 50.75 3 10 20 56.48 4 15 25 62.97 5 20 30 66.53 Upon comparison of runs 1, 2, 3, 4, it can be seen that the increment in percentage solids after dewatering is greater than the rise in solids content caused solely by addition of the increased amount of FBCR precipitate. As used throughout the specification and claims, the term FBCR precipitate is used to signify that portion of the residue which is left after substantial amounts of the quicklime component has been separated. Further, the term hydrated lime as used throughout this specification refers to calcium hydroxide hydrated high calcium quicklime or a mixture of calcium hydroxide and either magnesium oxide dolomitic monohydrate or magnesium hydroxide dolomitic dehydrate . Similarly, limestone refers to naturally occurring limestone or dolomite generally consisting of calcium carbonate a mixture of calcium carbonate or a mixture of calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate. Various modification to my invention can be made without departing from the true spirit thereof. For instance, the blunging treatment by which the supernatant limecontaining liquor is separated from the particulate precipitate matter of the fluidized bed combustion residue may be substituted by other well known separation techniques. The appended claims are intended to cover all such substitutions and equivalents.
