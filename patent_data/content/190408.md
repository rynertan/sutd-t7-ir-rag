# Structural component for a coal gasification system, made from a sulfidation resisting chromium nickel aluminium silicon alloy steel.

## Abstract
A structural component 17 for a coal gasification system is subjected to a hot gaseous atmosphere, produced by the reaction between coal and a gasifier, such as oxygen, air, steam or hydrogen. The component should resist sulphide embrittlement, a corrosion form caused by Hâ‚‚S at high temperature, and is made of a Cr Ni Al Si alloy steel, consisting essentially of, by weight C 0.03 to 0.3 Si 1 to 10 Mn up to 2 Cr 16 to 20 Ni 8 to 14 Al 0.5 to 10 Fe balance, with a minimum of 50 .
