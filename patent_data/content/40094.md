# Carburizing process utilizing atmospheres generated from nitrogen ethanol based mixtures.

## Abstract
A process for carburizing ferrous metal articles in a fur nace under an atmosphere derived from an input of nitrogen and ethanol injected into the furnace during the entire cycle. Carburization is controlled in a first embodiment by the con trol of ethanol and nitrogen mixture and water vapor content of the mixture as well as total flow through the furnace and in a second embodiment by controlling the nitrogen ethanol mixture to which is added water and an enriching or carburiz ing agent.
