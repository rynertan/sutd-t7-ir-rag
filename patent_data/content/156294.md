# ADJUSTABLE PHASE POWER DIVIDER APPARATUS

## Abstract
A phase shifter apparatus which imposes a desired phase shift on an electromagnetic wave traveling through a waveguide, and divides the power in an output waveguide into two parts. The phase shifter apparatus includes a quarter wave plate for changing the polarization of the linearly polarized wave to a circularly polarized wave, a rod of ferromagnetic material with a magnetic field for imposing a desired phase shift on the circularly polarized wave traveling through the rod, a quarter wave plate for converting the circu larly polarized wave to a linearly polarized wave, and a sep tum polarizer in the output wave guide for dividing the power. The output waveguide has the power divided between two ports, and independent phase shifts are imposed on the elec tromagnetic waves of each port.
