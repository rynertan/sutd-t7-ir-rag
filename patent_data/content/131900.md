# Incremental angular encoder.

## Abstract
The incremental angular encoder has a device for the freely selected setting of an absolute zero or reference point. This additional device consists of a reduction gear 4 , which is connected on the input side to the shaft 1 of the angular encoder and, on the output side, to a disk 5 , which has an opto electronically scannable hole or light reflection mark 11 . The disk 5 is preferably a gear wheel which is connected, via a friction clutch, to the reduction gear 4 and which can be adjusted from outside by means of a toothed key 7 provided with a pinion, so that the absolute zero point can be exactly set. By selection of the gear wheels R1,R2,R3,R4 of the reduction gear 4 , the reduction ratio can be varied within wide limits and, consequently, the absolute zero point can be set over a wide range.
