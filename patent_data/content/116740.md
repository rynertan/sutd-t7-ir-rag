# Improvements in separable fastener.

## Abstract
A separable fastener of the press on pull off types comprises similar first and second fastener members, each member including a base having a plurality of tapered projections extending from one face surface and a plurality of tapered receptacles recessed into the face surface. Projections and receptacles are positioned in identical pat terns and spacings, each projection and receptacle being totally surrounded and isolated by a portion of the base material. The projections on each fastener member are contoured to engage in the receptacles of the other fastener member with a releasable friction fit.
