## Description
The process of enamelling cold rolled steel sheet suitable for enamelling with a base coat and a cover coat layer, as well as articles enamelled according to such a process.Background of the inventionIn the art of porcelain enamelling there are two major techniques for applying white and coloured enamel coatings. The first technique comprises a two coat two fire system in a first step, a base coat is applied to the steel which ensures proper adherence to the underlying metal and which is suitable to absorb the effects of the reaction between the enamel and the steel during firing. Over this base coat, which is dark blue, grey or brown due to the presence of adherence promoting oxides, a white or coloured covercoat can be applied to provide the required optical, mechanical and chemical properties.The second technique, which is the more recent one, directly applies the covercoat to the sheet steel. To obtain a good adherence, a special pretreatment is necessary consisting of a more severe etch of the metal surface, followed by the deposition of a porous nickel layer. To minimize the reaction between steel and enamel, a very low carbon quality sheet steel is used with C 6 0.005 . Although this sheet steel is sold at a premium price and the pretreatment is expensive, the savings obtained by the elimination of the base coat with application and firing exceed this extra cost. As the firing of the enamel coating is an important cost factor, there have been many developments towards a system where the base coat and the covercoat are applied and fired in one operation. TheUSP 2602758 1950 shows that for a good result the base coat has to be applied thin, and has to soften at an equal or lower temperature than the covercoat.To prevent mixing of the groundcoat and covercoat layer during firing due to thermal decomposition of clay usually present in the enamel slurries, the base coat slurry preferably is composed without clay. DAS 1621405, Mitt. VDEfa 27 1979 , 11, 121 132 .In the traditional application methods the enamel coats are applied in the form of an aqueous slurry, obtained by ball milling the enamel frit with around 50 of water and some clay and minor additions, such as electrolytes. This slurry is applied to the metal, e.g. by dipping, flow coating or spraying. After drying the applied layer is strong enough for handling. A problem which occurs when applying two coats without an intermediate firing cycle is that during the application of the covercoat, soluble components of the groundcoat layer, even when dried, migrate into the covercoat.Therefore, DP 1 621 405 teaches the addition of phosphates to the groundcoat slip to form a very dense and rigid groundcoat bisque after drying. However, these additions strongly influence the rheology of the groundcoat slurry and deteriorate the workability.DOS 2 538 601 shows the addition of water repellent chemicals siliconates to the groundcoat slurry, which prevent the intrusion of water from the covercoat slurry during application into the dried groundcoat. Hydrolysis of the siliconates, which reduces their water repelling properties, and defects in the enamel layer due to decomposition of these chemicals during firing prevented industrial application.With the development of the electrostatic dry powder application of porcelain enamel, the solution to the abovementioned problems was near dry application prevents mixing of base coat and covercoat during application, no soluble salts are present in the enamel layers, and no water to migrate.USP 4110487 and EP 0001234 show the properties of the powder necessary to obtain the desired results the proper combination of fusibility and surface tension of base and covercoat, and the preparation of the powder with water repellent silane coatings to obtain a high surface resistivity.One problem, however, is the vulnerability of the applied enamel layers before firing. Instead of the firm bisque, there are only the weak electrostatic forces which keep the enamel particles attached to the metal substrate. Equipment manufacturers have to find solutions to prevent loss of base coat during application of covercoat, which would lead to contamination of the recirculated covercoat with groundcoat and henceforth to imperfections dark specs in the fired enamel layer. This is especially important in the case of unfavourable atmospheric conditions high absolute humidity , which reduces the surface resistivity of the powders and makes especially the adherence of the base coat enamels, which already have the lower resistivity EP 0001234 , critical.Another negative aspect of the two coat one fire dry electrostatic process is the limitation of the application process. The two coat one fire process requires a thin layer of base coat, on which the covercoat is applied. Especially in hollow shapes and sharp edges, the Faraday cage effect and the rebounce of spraying air make it difficult or impossible to obtain an evenly spread, thin base coat layer other ways of applying electrostatic dry powder are not available. Description of the preferred embodimentsThe present invention seeks to avoid both the problems of the wet two coat one fire as well as those of the dry two coat one fire system. This will be favourable to an industrial application, which will combine the use of normal steel qualities with the reduced cost of only one firing cycle.In the application of the dry powder, the presence of humidity has to be aboided to obtain an acceptable adherence of the frit particles to the substrate before firing. Humidity decreases surface resistivity, which will lead to an increased leakage of charge, thus reducing electrostatic forces.Surprisingly it was found that nevertheless it is possible to apply a base coat slurry in the known way without any special preparation of the frit or addition to the slurry, and to apply over the dried bsique a covercoat by means of electrostatic dry powder spraying according to the known techniques. During the application of the covercoat there is not migration of soluble material due to the absence of water, and no risk of detaching base coat particles because of the mechanical strength of the bisque resulting after drying the applied slurry. The adherence of the covercoat powder to the groundcoat bisque is of the same magnitude as the adherence of powder directly to the steel substrate, and allows for handling the coated, unfired parts in a similar way.The base coat may be applied by any application method, such as dipping, spraying, flushing or flow coating, suitable to apply an even thin layer of base coat. The most suitable application method can be chosen depending on the shape of the parts to be coated.In the art of applying and firing a base coat to sheet steel it is known that there can be composed base coats in such a way that the pretreatment of the steel can be limited to a simple degreasing step, without the use of an acidic etch or even the application of a thin nickel layer EPA 18559, DAS 2710263 .In one embodiment of the invention the base coat material as used in the two coat one fire process according to the invention is composed in such a way. This means that the process according to the invention allows for applying a coating of porcelain enamel to conventional sheet steel qualities, limiting the pretreatment to a degreasing process and using one single firing cycle.When two enamel layers are applied to sheet steel and fired in one single firing cycle, the two coat one fire process, the base coat is preferably more fusible than the covercoat USP 4110487 .During the firing process the base coat will soften first and a reaction with the sheet steel will occur, in which the bonding mechanism is developed and during which gaseous reaction products will evolve.It is preferred that this reaction is stopped in the first stage of the firing cycle, to allow the covercoat to fuse and form a smooth defect free surface. To contribute to the termination of this reaction of the groundcoat it has been found favourable to add finely divided refractory material to the base coat slurry. During the reaction between base coat and sheet steel the fused base coat will slowly dissolve this refractory material, thus reducing its fusibility and reactivity and leading to the termination of the reaction with the sheet steel. This refractory material may be added in the form of a colloidal silica, such as Aerosil, a microporous alumina or a refractory mineral, such as Feldspar. It has been noticed before DAS 1621405, Mitt. VDEfa 27 1979 11, 121 132 that the addition of clay to the base coat slurry is detrimental to the surface quality in the two coat one fire process because of the evolution of gaseous reaction products during the firing cycle by thermal dehydration of the clay minerals.However, to obtain a workable base coat slurry, suspending agents have to be added. Preferably, these agents consist of low amounts of bentonite, carboxymethyl cellulose, alginates or similar inorganic or organic materials.Example IA base coat enamel frit with oxidic analysis Table 1 SiO2 41.4 2 4.9 2 3 18.7 R2O alkali oxide 22.7 RO alkaline earth oxide 5.9 P205 1 NiO 3 CoO 1.5 F 2 is milled in a ball mill according to the following milling formula Table 2 Frit 100 parts Quartz 10 Boric acid 0.3 Sodium nitrite 0.2 Aerosil 2 Water 45 to such a fineness that more than 94 passes a 325 mesh standard sieve.
