# INCREASED SELECTIVITIES IN THE OXIDATION OF OLEFINS TO ALPHA, BETA UNSATURATED CARBOXYLIC ACIDS

## Abstract
Olefins such as propylene are oxidized directly to α,β un saturated carboxylic acids such as acrylic acid with air or oxy gen in an aqueous medium, employing an activated palladium on carbon catalyst, in the presence of certain surfactants such as sodium dodecyl sulfonate in combination with a co surfac tant such as In a like manner isobutylene may be oxidized to meth acrylic acid, while butene 1 may be oxidized to crotonic acid.
