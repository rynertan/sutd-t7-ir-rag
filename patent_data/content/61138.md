# Angiotropins of leukocytes and inflamed tissue a new class of natural chemotropic protein mitogens for specific induction of directional growth of blood vessels, neovascularization of tissues and morphogenesis of blood vessel patterns, process for their biotechnical preparation and pharmaceutical compositions.

## Abstract
The invention relates to new angiotropins of leukocytes and inflamed tissue which have the biological and physi cochemical porperties stated in the patent claims. The compounds selectively stimulate the direction growth of blood vessels and lead to a neovascularization of tissue. The invention also relates to a biotechnical process for preparing and isolating the angiotropins and to pharmaceutical com positions containing them.
