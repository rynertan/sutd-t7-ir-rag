# POTENTIATION OF TOPICAL COMPOSITIONS

## Abstract
Topically applied compositions are disclosed. Further, sunscreening compositions are disclosed comprising ultra violet light absorbing materials and film forming polymers which exhibit enhanced protection from erythema causing radiation. The observed enhancement in activity of the topical composition may be seen to occur with other topically applied materials.
