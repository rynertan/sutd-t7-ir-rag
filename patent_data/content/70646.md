# Alkaline electric storage cells.

## Abstract
An alkaline electric storage cell comprises a con tainer 2 within which are positive and negative pocket plates 4 and 6 separated by composite separators 8. Each separator has a lower portion 30, 36 which is of conventional ladder type having a substantially open area and an upper portion which is a strip 38 of absorb ent fibrous material. The cell is filled with electrolyte up to a level 44 which is slightly above the bottom of the strips 38. The high discharge rate voltage of the cell is scarcely impaired by comparison with a conven tional cell, but the oxygen that is evolved at the end of charge is recombined at those portions of the ne gative plates which are above the electrolyte level but retained moist with electrolyte by the absorbent strips 38. The cell thus loses no electolyte and is of no maintenance type at charging rates of up to C 60 or more.
