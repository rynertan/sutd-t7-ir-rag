## Description
METHOD FOR PRODUCING AN OLEFIN POLYMERIZATION CATALYST, CATALYST AND POLYMERIZATION PROCESSThe invention relates to a process for producing an olefin polymerization catalyst and the use of same for polymerizing olef ins. European patent application 0 007 425 discloses a process for producing an olefin polymerization catalyst comprising 1 mixing a first and a second catalyst component wherein said first catalyst component is formed by reaction of a a metal halide compound selected from metal dihalides and metal hydr.oxyhalides of a Group IIA or IIB metal of the MendeleevPeriodic Table, with b a transition metal compound of a Group IVB or VB metal of the Mendeleev Periodic Table, the transition metal being bonded to at least one oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur atom, and said oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur atoms in turn being bonded to a carbon atom of a carbon containing radical, to obtain a solid reaction product A and then 2 treating said solid product A with a transition metal halide as a halide ion exchanging source to obtain said olefin polymerization catalystSurprisingly, it has been found that it is not necessary to use an organometallic compound as second catalyst component as required in the process of European patent application 0 007 425. Thus, the invention relates to a process for producing an olefin polymerization catalyst comprising 1 mixing a first and a second catalyst component wherein said first catalyst component is formed by reaction of a a metal halide compound selected from metal dihalides and metal hydroxyhalides of a Group IIA or IIB metal of the MendeleevPeriodic Table, with b a transition metal compound of a Group IVB or VB metal of the Mendeleev Periodic Table, the transition metal being bonded to at least one oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur atom, and said oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur atoms in turn being bonded to a carbon atom of a carbon containing radical, to obtain a solid reaction product A and then 2 treating said solid product A with a transition metal halide as a halide ion exchanging source to obtain said oliefin polymerization catalyst, which process is c h a r a c t e r i z e d b y using as said second catalyst component a precipitating agent selected from metal halides and oxygen containing halides of a Group IIIA, IVA, IVB, VA or VB element of theMendeleev Periodic Table, hydrogen halides, and organic acid halides of the formulaEMI2.1 wherein R is an alkyl, aryl, or cycloalkyl group or a radical combined of these groups, and X is a halogen atom.According to the process of the invention, the use of orga nometallic compounds as second catalyst component can be avoided. The obtained olefin polymerization catalyst has excellent polymer productivity. In general the productivity is so high that the polymer produced contains catalyst residues only in such low amount that a tedious and costly EMI3.1 tb catalyst SEP residue SEP removal SEP is SEP not SEP necessary. tb As SEP used SEP herein SEP the SEP term SEP Mendeleev SEP Periodic SEP Table SEP is tb meant SEP the SEP Periodic SEP Table SEP of SEP the SEP Elements SEP as SEP shown SEP in SEP the tb inside SEP front SEP cover SEP of SEP Perry, SEP Chemical SEP Engineer s SEP Handbook, tb 4th SEP Edition, SEP McGraw SEP Hill SEP Co. SEP 1963 . tb halide a As noted above the metalz compoundXis selected from metal dihalide compounds and metal hydroxyhalide compounds and the metal of the metal halide compound is selected from Group IIA and Group IIB metals, such as for example beryllium, magnesium, calcium and zinc.Some suitable metal halide compounds include for example, beryllium dichloride, beryllium dibromide, beryllium hydroxyiodide, magnesium dichloride, magnesi omide, magnesium hydroxychloride, magnesium diiodide, magnesium difluoride, calcium dichloride, calcium dibromide, calcium hydroxybromide, zinc dichloride, zinc difluoride, and zinc hydroxychloride. While metal hydroxyhalide compounds are known in the art, they are not as common and as readily available as metal dihalide compounds tberefore, metal dihalides are preferred. Of the metal dihalides1 magnesium dihalides, and particularly magnesium dichloride is preferred because it is readily available and relatively inexpensive and has provided excellent results.The metal dihalide component is generally used in the form of an anhydrous, particulate solid to facilitate its reaction with the transition metal compound. It is also noted that various techniques for converting a metal halide compound to a fine particulate form, couch as for example roll milling, reprecipitating, etc., can be used to prepare the metal halide compound for use according to the present invention and that such additional preparation of the metal halide compound promotes the reaction of the metal halide compound with the transition metal compound however, it does not appear to make any difference in a catalyst of the present invention prepared from a composition of matter of the present invention if the metal halide compound is in a fine particulate form, that is, polymer productivity for example is not a function of the size of the particles of the metal halide compound. Preparation of metal hydroxyhalide compounds are described in K. Soga, S. Katano, Y. Akimoto and T. Kagiya, Polymerization of alpha Olefins with Supported Zieglertype Catalysts , Polymer Journal, Vol. 2, No. 5, pp. 128 134 1973 . The transition metal of the transition metal compoun Rloted above is selected from Group IVB and Group VB transition metals and is generally selected from titanium, zirconium, and vanadium although other transition metals can be employed. Excellent results have been obtained with titanium compounds and they are preferred. Some of the titanium compounds suitable for use in the invention include for example titanium tetrahydrocarbyloxides, titanium tetraimides, titanium tetrsamides and titanium tetramercaptides. Other transition metal compounds include for example zirconium tetrahydrocarbyloxides, zirconium tetraimides, zirconium tetraamides, zirconium tetramercaptides, vanadium tetrahydrocarbyloxides, vanadium tetraimides, vanadium tetraamides and vanadium tetramercaptides. The titanium tetrahydrocarbyloxides are the preferred titanium compounds because they produce excellent results and are readily available. Suitable titanium tetrahydrocarbyloxide compounds include those expressed by the general formula Ti OR 4 wherein each R is individually selected from an alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, alkaryl, and aralkyl hydrocarbon radical containing from about 1 to about 20 carbon atoms per radical and each R can be the same or different. Titanium tetrahydrocarbyloxides in which the hydrocarbyl group contains from about 1 to about 10 carbon atoms per radical are most often employed because they are more readily available. Suitable titanium tetrahydrocarbyloxides include, for example, titanium tetramethoxide, titanium dimethoxydiethoxide, titanium tetraethoxide, titanium tetra nbutoxide, titanium tetrahesyloxide, titanium tetradecyloxide, titanium tetraeicosyloxide, titanium tetracyclohexyloxide, titanium tetrabenzyloxide, titanium tetra p tolyloxide and titanium tetraphenoxide. Of the titanium tetrahydrocarbyloxides, titanium tetraalkoxides are generally preferred and titanium tetraethoxide is particularly preferred because of the excellent results obtained employing this material. Titanium tetraethoxide is also generally available at a reasonable cost. b The molar ratio of the transition metal compound to the metal a halide compound A can be selected over a relatively broad range. Generally the molar ratio is within the range of about 10 1 to about 1 10, however, the most common molar ratios are within the range of about 2 1 to about 1 2. When titanium tetrahydrocarbyloxide and magnesium dichloride are employed, a molar ratio of titanium to magnesium of about 2 1 is presently recommended as all the magnesium compound apparently goes into solution easily. The metal halide compound and the transition metal compound employed in the present invention are normally mixed together by heating, e.g. refluxing, these two components together in a suitable dry essential absence of water solvent or diluent, which is essentially inert to the these components and the product produced. By the term inert is meant that the solvent does not chemically react with the dissolved components such as to interfere with the formation of the product or the stability of the product once it is formed. Such solvents or diluents include, for example, n pentane, n heptane, methylcyclohexane, toluene, xylenes and the like.It is emphasized that aromatic solvents are preferred, such as for example xylene because the solubility of the metal halide compound and the transition metal compound is higher in aromatic solvents as compared to aliphatic solvents, particularly at low temperatures, which as described hereinafter, are preferred when mixing the metal halide compound and the transition metal compound in the solvent with an organometallic compound. Such mixing temperatures are generally within the range of from about 0 C to about 100 C and preferably from about 150 C to about 40 C.It is also noted that as compared to aliphatic solvents the use of aromatic solvents, such as for example xylene, appears to improve production of larger polymer particles and or polymer particles with improved resistance to attrition when the composition resulting from the chemical combination of the metal halide compound and the transition metal compound is used. Generally the amount of solvent or diluent employed can be selected over a broad range. Usually the amount of solvent or diluent is within the range of about 20 to about lb0cc per gram of metal dihalide. The temperature employed during the heating step can also be selected over a broad range. Normally the heating temperature is within the range of about 15 C to about 1500 C when the heating step is carried out at atmospheric pressure. Obviously the heating temperatures employed would be higher if the pressure employed is above atmospheric pressure. The pressure employed during the heating stew does not appear to be a significant parameter.In addition to the above noted solvents or diluents, more polar solvents or diluents such as nitrobenzene and halogenated hydrocarbons, e.g. methylene chloride, chlorobenzene and 1,2 dichloroethane can be used, particularly when producing compositions of the invention having a molar ratio of the transition metal compound to the metal dihalide compound of other 2 1. In addition, normal saturated alkanols, such as, for example, ethanol, n butanol and the like, and saturated ethers particularly saturated cyclic ethers such as, for example, tetrabydrofuran, can be used alone or in combination with the previously mentioned solvents or diluents in producing catalyst compositions according to the invention.Mixed solvents or diluents, such as for example, a mixture of n hexane and tetrahydrofuran having a volume volume ratio of, for example, about 50 50 can be employed in solubilizing hydrocarbon soluble metal dihalides which are relatively difficult to solubilize, such as, for example, zinc dichioride and the like. Other suitable mixtures of two or more of the above solvents to solubilize the reagents of the first catalyst component can of course also be used and can be readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art. theart Generally, the time required for heating these two components together is within the range of about 5 minutes to about 10 hours, although in most instances a time within the range of about 15 minutes to about 3 hours is sufficient.Folloving the heating operation, the resulting solution can be filtered to remove any undissolved material or extraneous solid, if desired. The composition of matter thus produced and which is in solution can be recovered from the solvent or diluent by crystallation or other suitable means.

A solid reaction product A is formed which precipitates out of the solution. The second catalyst component is a precipitating agent selected from the group consisting of metal halides and oxygencontaining halides of elements selected from Groups IIIA, IVA,IVB, VA, and VB of the Mendeleev Periodic Table, hydrogen halides, and organic acid halides expressed asEMI7.2 wherein R is an alkyl, aryl, cycloalkyl group or combinations thereof containing from 1 to about 12 carbon atoms andX is a halogen atom. Some metal halides and oxygen containing halides of elements selected from Groups IIIA, IVA, IVB, VA, and VB suitable for use as the second component preferably include such as, for example, aluminum tribromide, aluminum trichloride, aluminum triiodide, tin tetrabromide, tin tetrachloride, silicon tetrabromide, silicon tetrachloride, phosphorus oxychloride, phosphor zs trichloride, phosphorDes pentabromide, vanadium tetrachloride, vanadium oxytrichloride, vanadyl trichloride, zirconium tetrachloride, and the like. The hydrogen halides suitable for use as the second catalyst component include preferably such as, for example, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide, and the like. The organic acid halides suitable for use as the second catalyst component preferably include such as, for example, acetyl chloride, propionyl fluoride, dodecanoyl chloride, 3 cyclopentylpropionyl chloride, 2 napEthoyl chloride, benzoyl bromide, benzoyl chloride, and the like. The molar ratio of the transition metal compoundAof the first catalyst. component to the second catalyst component can be selected over a relatively broad range. Generally, the molar ratio of the transition metal of the first catalyst component to the second catalyst component is within a range of from about. 10 1 to about 1 10 and more generally within a range of about 2 1 to about 1 3 since a molar ratio within the latter range usually produces a catalyst which can be employed as an especially active ethylene polymerization catalyst. The temperature employed while mixing the first and second catalyst components as above described can be selected over a broad range. Generally the temperature employed is within a range of about 1000 C to about 500 C or higher, while temperatures within the range of j c C to about 300 C were most often employed, additional investigstion has surprisingly established that the use of a temperature within the range of about 1000 C to about 0 C for mixing the first and second catalyst components together results in the production of larger polymer particles and or polymer particles with improved resistance to attrition as compared to polymer produced with a catalyst where the first and second catalyst components were mixed together at a temperature above 0 C.As the data hereinafter indicates polymer particles of good size were produced employing a mixing temperature for the first and second catalyst components within the range of from about 15 C to about 40 C and mixing temperatures within this range are preferred. Since heat is evolved when the first catalyst component and the second catalyst component are mixed, the mixing rate is adjusted as required and additional cooling is employed in order to maintsin a relatively constant mixing temperature. It is noted with respect to mixing the first and second components that the order of addition is not important and either component can be added to the other.After completing the mixing, the resulting slurry is stirred or agitated for a sufficient time, generally within a range of about 15 minutes to about 5 hours to insure that mixing of the components is complete. It is recommended that the stirring or agitation be carried out whereby the slurry is maintained at the mixing temperature for the first 10 to about 30 minutes after mixing and then gradually raising the temperature of the slurry to smbient temperature for the remainder of the stirring or agitation period. Thereafter, stirring is discontinued and the solid product recovered by filtration, decantation, and the like. The product is then washed with a suitable material such as a hydrocarbon, e.g., n pentane, n heptane, cyclohexane, benzene, xylenes and the like, to remove any soluble material which may be present.The product is then dried and stored under dry nitrogen.The products formed in this manner are designated as catalyst A as previously described.The solid reaction product A is then treated with a halide ion exchanging source which is a halide of a transition metes in order to produce a catalyst of enhanced activity.Some examples of suitable halide ion exchanging sources that have been employed are titanium tetrachloride, vanadium oxychioride VOC13 and zirconium tetrachloride. Because titanium tetrachloride is readily available and produced excellent results after somewhat extensive experimentation, it is preferred. Generally, treating the product A with the halide ion exchanging source takes place in a suitable diluent such as a hydrocarbon diluent, for example, n pentane, n heptan, cyclohexane, benzene, xylenes, and the like, to facilitate the treating process. The treating temperature can be selected over a relatively broad range and is normally within a range of about 0 C to about 2000 C. S urprisingly it has also been found that employing a temperature within the range of about 800 C to about 1800 C for treating productA with a halide ion exchanging source results in the production of larger polymer particles and or polymer particles with improved resistance to attrition as compared to polymer produced with a catalyst prepared at a lower treating temperature.In view of the above discovery the preferred treating temperature for treating product A with a halide ion exchanging source is from about 1000 C to about 1300 C when considering the over all catalyst performance. While the use of treating temperatures in excess of 1300 C, such as for example 1500 C to about 1800 C, produces catalysts that provide larger and or more attrition resistant polymer particles as compared to polymer particles produced with catalysts prepared at treating temperatures of 1300 C and below, catalysts produced with treating temperatures of about 1500 C to about 1800 C also show a marked reduction in productivity as compared to catalysts prepared at treating temperatures of 1300 C and below. It is also noted that particularly good results have been obtained employing the low mixing temperatures for mixing the first and second catalyst components together as described above to produce product A which is subsequently treated with a halide ion exchanging source employing the high treating temperatures also described above.For example use of a mixing temperature within the range of about OO C to about 1000 C for mixing the first and second catalyst components together to produce product A preferably in an aromatic solvent and then using a treating temperature within the range of about 800 C to about 1800 C for treating product A with a halide ion exchanging source results in J catalyst which produces especially large and or attrition resistant polymer particles. The treating time can also be selected over a broad range and generally is within the range of about 10 minutes to about 10 hours.While the weight ratio of the halide ion exchanging source to product A can be selected over a relatively broad range, the weight ratio of the halide ion exchanging source to product A is generally within a range of about 10 1 to about 1 10 and more generally from about 7 1 to about 1 4.Following the treatment of product A with the halide ion exchanging source the surplus halide ion exchanging source the halide ion the exchanging source which is not bound toAcatalyst is removed by washing the catalyst with a dry essential absence of water liquid such as a hydrocarbon of the type previously disclosed, n hexane, or xylene for the desired . example. The resulting product,tcstalyst , atter arying, rs stored under dry nitrogen. the It has been found that catalyst the can be stored for a month or longer without any significant decrease in activity. If desired, the catalyst can be admixed vith a particulate diluent such as, for example, silica, silica alumina, silica titania, magnesium dichloride, magnesium oxide, polyethylene, polypropylene, and poly phenylene sulfide , prior to using the catalyst in a polymerization process. While the weight ratio of the particulate diluent to catalyst can be selected over a relatively wide range, the weight ratio of particulate diluent to catalyst generally is within the range of about 100 1 to about 1 100. More often, the weight ratio of particulate diluent to catalyst is within the range of about 20 1 to about 2 1 and use of a particulate diluent has been found effective to facilitate charging of the catalyst to the reactor. While it may not be necessary in all instances to employ a cocatalyst with the catalyst of the present invention, the use of cocatalysts is recommended for best results. The preferred cocatalysts suitable for use in accordance with the invention are organometallic compounds such as lithium alkyls, Grignard reagents, dialkyl magnesium compounds, dialkyl zinc compounds, organoaluminum compounds, etc.The organometallic compound is preferably an organoaluminum halide compound which includes for example, dihydrocarbylaluminum monohalides of the formula R 2A1X, monohydrocarbylaluminum dihalides of the formula R AlX2 and hydrocarbylaluminum sesquihalides of the formula R 3Al2X3 or an organoaluminum compound of the formula R 3A1 wherein each R in the above formulas is individually selected from linear and brcnched chain hydrocarbyl radicals containing from 1 to about 20 carbon atoms per radical and can be the same or different and each X is a halogen atom and can be the same or different.Some suitable organoaluminum halide compounds include, for example, methylaluminum dibromide, ethylaluminum dichloride, ethylaluminum diiodide, isobutylaluminum dichloride, dodecylaluminum dibromide, dimethylaluminum bromide, diethylaluminum chloride, diisopropylaluminum chloride, methyl n propylaluminum bromide, di n octylaluminum bromide, diphenylaluminum chloride, dicyclohexylaluminum bromide, dieicosylaluminum chloride, methylaluminum sesquibromide, ethylaluminum sesquichloride, ethylaluminum sesquiiodide, and the like.The organoaluminum cocatalysts are preferred. Specific examples are trimethylaluminuw, triethylaluminum, triisopropylaluminum, tridecylaluminum, trieicosylaluminum, tricyclohexylaluminum, triphenylaluminum, 2 methylpentyldiethylaluminum, and triisoprenylaluminum. Triethylaluminum is preferred since this compound produced excellent results in the runs hereafter described. The molar ratio of the organometallic compound of the cocatalyst to the transition metal compound of the first catalyst component is not particularly critical and can be selected over a relatively broad range. Generally, the molar ratio of the organometallic compound of the cocatalyst to the transition metal compound of the first catalyst component is within a range of about 1 1 to about 1500 1.However, it has been found that generally when relatively high amounts of the cocatalyst is employed in relation to the catalyst larger andlor more attrition resistant polymer particles are produced. For example, larger and or more attrition resistant particles are produced when the weight ratio of cocatalyst to catalyst employed is at least about 4 1 up to about 400 1 and higher however, weight ratios of cocatalyst to catalyst within the range of about 6 1 to about 100 1 are generally recommended as the best compromise between particle size and or attrition resistance and polymer production since it has been found that generally the higher the cocatalyst level the lower the polymer production per unit weight of catalyst. A variety of polymerizable compounds are suitable for use in the process of the present invention. Olefins which can be homopolymeriwed or copolymerized with the invention catalysts include aliphatic mono l olefins. While the invention would appear to be suitable for use with any aliphatic mono l olefin, those olefins having 2 to 18 carbon atoms are nost often used. The mono l olefins can be polymerized according to the present invention employing either a particle form process or a solution form process. Aliphatic mono lolefins can be copolymerized with other l olefins and or with other smaller amounts of other ethylenically unsaturated monomers, such as 1,3 butadiene, isoprene, 1,3 pentadiene, styrene, alpha methylstyrene, and similar ethylenically unsaturated monomers which do not impair the catalyst. The catalysts of this invention can also be utilized to prepare homopolymers and copolymers of conjugated diolefins. Generally the conjugated diolefins contain 4 to 8 carbon atoms per molecule. Examples of suitable conjugated diolefins include 1,3 butadiene, isoprene, 2 methyl l,3 butadiene, 1,3 pentadiene, and 1,3 octadiene. Suitable comonomers, besides the conjugated diolefins listed above include mono l olefins previously described and vinylaromatic compounds generally. Some suitable vinylaromatic compounds are those having from about 8 to about 14 carbon atoms per molecule, and include for trample styrene and various alkylstyrenes, such as 4 ethylstyrene and such as 1 vinylnaphthalene. The weight percent of the conjugated diolefin in the copolymerization mixture can be selected over a relatively broad range.Generally the weight percent of the conjugated diolefin is from about 10 to about 95 weight percent and the other comonomers are from about 90 to about 5 veight percent. However, the weight percent of the conjugated diolefin is preferably from about 50 to about 90 weight percent and the other comonoiners are from about 50 to about 10 weight percent. In one aspect of the invention, the catalysts of the present invention have been found to be particularly effective for polymerization of mono l olefins such as ethylene as extremely high productivities have been obtained and thus mono l olefins such as ethylene are the preferred monomers for use with the catalysts of the present invention. The polymerization process according to the present invention employing the catalysts and cocatalysts as above described can be performed either batchwise or continuously. In a batch process, for example, a stirred autoclave is prepared by first purging with nitrogen and then with a suitable compound, such as isobutane for example. When the catalyst and cocatalyst are employed either can be charged to the reactor first or they can be charged simultaneously through an entry port under an isobutane purge. After closing the entry port, hydrogen, if used, is added, and then a diluent such as isobutane is added to the reactor.The reactor is heated to the desired reaction temperature, which for polymerizing ethylene, for example, is, for best results, generally within a range of about 500 C to about 1200 C and the ethylene is then admitted and maintained at a partial pressure within a range of about 5 10 MPa to about 5.0 MPa 70 725 psig for best results. At the end of the designated reaction period, the polymerization reaction is terminated and the unreacted olefin and isobutane are vented. The reactor is opened and the polymer, such as polyethylene, is collected as a free flowing white solid and is dried to obtain the product. In a continuous process, for example, a suitable reactor such as a loop reactor is continuously charged with suitable quantities of solvent or diluent, catalyst, cocatalyst, polymerizable compounds and hydrogen if any and in any desirable order. The reactor product is continuously withdrawn and the polymer recovered as appropriate, generally by flashing the diluent solvent and unreacted monomers and drying the resulting polymer. The olefin polymers made with the catalysts of this invention are useful in preparing articles by conventional polyolefin processing techniques such as injection molding, rotational molding, extrusion of film, and the like. For example, polyethylene made with the catalysts of this invention is typically of narrow molecular weight distribution which is especially desirable for injection molding applications.Furthermore, the polyethylene produced as described generally has a desirable high bulk density of about 0.44 g cc as recovered from the polymerization zone. In addition, the polyethylene produced as described is characterized y a high degree of stiffness, e.g. high flexural modulus, which is also desirable in many applications.Further details, in particular concerning the preparation of the first catalyst component and the treatment with the halide ion exchange source are disclosed in European patent application 0 007 425 which is incorporated herein by reference. EXAMPLE Catalyst Preparation All mixing and filtering operations were conducted in a dry box under a nitrogen atmosphere employing dry n heptane as the reaction medium. Anhydrous magnesium di chloride gC12 and titanium tetraethoxide labbreviated Ti OEt 4 were charged to a vessel equipped for stirring and refluxing. Catalyst I To a vessel was charged 3.88 g 0.041 mole of MgC12, 18.20 g of 85 pure Ti OEt 4 equivalent to 0.0679 mole of 100X alkoxide and 200 ml of n beptane. The vessel was capped and removed from the box and heated while stirring for 35 minutes at about 960C to obtain a solution.The solution was cooled to about room temperature 250C and while stirring, 7.55 ml 0.079 mole of VOC13 as a precipitating agent was charged by syringe to the vessel in less than about 3 minutes resulting in the formation of a voluminous, white precipitate. The slurry was stirred an additional 30 minutes. The vessel was returned to the dry box, its contents were suction filtered and the cake washed with 50 ml of dry n hexane in small portions , then dried under an argon stream to afford 10.0 g of a white powder. While in the dry box a vessel was charged with 2.0 g of the white powder and slurried with 10 ml of n hexane. The vessel was capped, removed from the box, injected with 2.2 ml 3.8 g, 0.020 mole of TiC14, and heated for 40 minutes at about 1000 C with stirring. Stirring and heating were discontinued and the vessel and contents cooled to room temperature and returned to the dry box.

The solution was cooled to about 250 C and treated dropwise with 10 ml 0.0872 mole of SiC14 diluted in 30 ml of m xylene over a 30 minute period, using a needle valve to introduce the solution. The vessel containing a lemon colored slurry was transferred to the dry box where the slurry was suction filtered.The white filter cake was washed with 100 ml of dry n hexane and dried under an argon stream to yield 5.44 g of a white powder. While in the dry box, 2.00 g of the white powder above was charged to a vessel, slurried with 10 ml n hexane, the vessel capped and removed from the box. The vessel was then injected with 2.2 ml 3.8 g, 0.020 mole of TiC14 and heated for about 40 minutes at 950C with stirring. Stirring and heating were discontinued, the vessel and contents cooled to room temperature and returned to the dry box. The contents were suction filtered, the filter cake washed with 50 ml of dry n hexane and dried under an argon stream to afford 2.0 g of a white powder as the catalyst II. II The catalystwas analyzed and found to contain 2.1 wt. X Ti, 21.6 wt. Mg, 0.13 wt. X Al, 8.8 wt. X C1, 1.9 wt. X Si, the balance being C, X, and 0 which was not determined. Catalyst II has not been used to polymerize any monomer.Based on the analyzed results shoving the presence of titanium and by analogy with other related titanium containing catalysts of this invention there is no doubt but that it would be an active l olefin polymerization catalyst. Ethylene Polymerization A 3.8 liter, stirred, stainless steel reactor was employed for ethylene polymerization. The reactor was conditioned for for each run by charging to it 3 liters of dry n heptane, closing the port, and heating the reactor and contents at 1750 C for 30 minutes. The reactor was drained and residual heptane purged with dry nitrogen. The reactor was then closed and cooled under nitrogen pressure. The conditioned reactor in each run was purged with dry isobutane, 1 cc of triethylaluminum cocatalyst solution 1 molar in n heptane was charged followed by addition of the catalyst. The reactor was closed, about 2 liters of dry isobutane was added to it, the reactor and contents were heated to the indicated temperature, ethylene and hydrogen, if used, were charged and the run was started. Each run was conducted for 60 minutes. Each run was terminated and the polymer recovered, dried and weighed to obtain the yield. Each polymer yield was divided by the weight of catalyst employed to determine the calculated catalyst productivity which is expressed as kilograms kg polyethylene per gram g catalyst per hour.The initial ethylene pressure was 1.5 MPa 215 psia and the initial hydrogen pressure was 0.45 MPa 65 psia . The quantity of the catalyst employed, conditions used, and results obtained are presented in the Table.
