# Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging system.

## Abstract
A nuclear magnetic resonance imaging system compris ing a high field solenoidal magnet M providing a uniform static magnetic field surrounding a subject, an RF coil surrounding the subject, a receiver coil surrounding the subject, and a cylindrical shell 16 of magnetic material surrounding the magnet M and the RF and receiver coils. The shell 16 is positioned such that the wall thereof lies in the area of the field of the magnet M where the shells permeability is substantially at a maximum for the imposed field such that the shell 16 functions to substantially confine the field of the magnet M to an area about the shell 16 and the environment is not adversely affected and no additional protection is required surrounding the system.
