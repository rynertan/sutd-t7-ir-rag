# FORK AND ARM MECHANISM FOR REFUSE CONTAINER

## Abstract
An arm and fork mechanism 26,60 is disclosed for mov ing a refuse retainer 64 with respect to a refuse container 12 which has an opening 16 in the upper portion thereof. Arms 26 are pivotally mounted adjacent the refuse container 12 . The arms 26 are movable between a position adjacent a side portion of the refuse container 12 and are also movable to a position above the refuse container 12 . A fork 60 is support ed by each of the arms 26 and is angularly movable with respect to the arm 26 . A fluid motor 48 is operably joined to each arm 26 and operably joined to the respective fork 60 for angularly moving the forks 60 with respect to the arms 26 . The fluid motors 48 are provided with a plurality of oper ation positions. Thus, the forks 60 are angularly movable by the fluid motors 48 to any one of a plurality of angular posi tions for lifting and dumping a refuse retainer 64 .
