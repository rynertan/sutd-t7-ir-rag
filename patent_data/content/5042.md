## Description
BIN RECEIVER MECHANISM FOR A CONTINUOUS PAPER SORTING MACHINE This invention relates to sheet distributing or sorting devices and more particularly to a receiver apparatus which can continuously receive and sort large numbers of multi paged documents as copies of a page proceed from a reproducing device such as a printer or copy making machine. This application references copending European Patent Application No 79300624.3 filed on evendate herewith for ContinuousPaper Sorting Machine and corresponding to U.S.Patent Application Serial No 897 272 filed 17th April 1978. Prior art paper distributors, sorters and or collators have encountered many problems. One is that the lare increase in the costs of labour and materials has made it more imperative that the available press or duplicator capacity be utilized to its fullest. In order for the maximum production capability of a printing or copy making machine to be utilized, it is necessary that the sorter have the capacity to receive the printer or copy machine output without loss of press, duplicator or copy making machine time. Large capacity sorting machines have been introduced to the market place but they are not continuous. For instance, in some sorters, after a vertical column of trays or bins has been filled, it is necessary to stop the press and shift that filled column away from the feeder and then move an empty column into position.Thus, there is a significant amount of press or copy machine production time lost. Additionally, time is lost if the bins have to be unloaded on line. The variety of copy sorting jobs sorter collaters must handle suggests that the receiver should be modular to the extent that if one unit does not have the capacity, additional receiver capacity may be provided without any substantial loss of time or extra handling of the copied material. While smaller collators or sorters are mainly intended for the office market as a necessary adjunct to office copying machinery, larger sorters are more intended for the high production commercial market and for large in plant reproduction centers, commercial houses and printing departments.These higher volune paper handling installations may be turning out catalogs, maintenance manuals, instruction books, brochures, sales material and perhaps other items such as reports, bid specifications and other large quantity multi page publications. Those skilled in the art will appreciate the savings in labor, time and expense if the reproduction capacity of a particular printing or copying center can be sorted at a rate which is consistent with the copy making capability. Ainoiy tulle prior art references which may be considered witll respect to the features of this invention are the following United States Patent Nos. 3,420,517 3,273,882 3,356,362 3,848,867 3,937,459 3,938,801 3,740,050 3,944,217 and 3.963,235. TIje devices covered by the above patents do not disclose the structure of this invention. A continuous paper sorting machine in which the receiver with the bin is designed generally in accordance with the teachings of U. S. Patent No. 3,938,801 which describes side by side stacks of inclined columns of paper receiving bins or shelves. The receiver is moved laterally with respect to a generally upright feeding device, in which the feeder presents a generally vertical feed conveyor with deflectors and guides for intercepting sheets moving up or down the conveyor and directing them into bins in the receiver as the receiver moves a given bin in a column past a given deflector. The receiver is constructed in two column modules and moves on casters along a track assembly, A chain drive mechanism has means for being releasably engaged by a fork on the receiver base.The chain is precisely controlled to present a particular bin address to a deflector at a given instant in time. Several modular receivers may be detachably engaged to each other so that as many as 600 bin addresses may be utilized. The bins are generally horizontal at their entrance end but tilt or slant to one side in order to aid the alignment of paper sheets into neat stacks as the sheets are fed into the bin. Accordingly, it is along the features, objects and advantages of the invention to provide a paper sorting nlac feeder device which is continuous and uniquely designed and intended for Inaximizing the production of a conunercial printing, reproducing, duplicating or copying center. TIL invention is particularly intended to reduce and to minimize the amount of time that a reproduction, printing or copying device loses other than that time which mutt be sacrificed to replacing masters in the press, duplicator or copy machine.Because of the unique receiver concept in conjunction with its unique feeder there is no necessity to stop the sorting of paper copies from column to column. The machine can continue to sort as the receiver noves in either direction on its track. A filled receiver can be easily disengaged from the driving means and rolled off the track assembly and an empty receiver moved onto the track and engaged and the feeder mechanism restarted. Thus, the receiver can be unloaded off line.The invention is particularly suited for use in printing shops or reproduction centers for such things as multipage brochures, catalogs, books and other items which must be produced in large numbers. The machine is capable of receiving sheets at te high apeuds of prevent day advanced copying, printing and duplicating machinery.The apparatus is uniquely simple and inexpensive for continuously filling a large number of bins. Figure l is a perspective view showing generally the general arrangement and organization of the sorter and particularly the receiver and feeder mechanism of this invention Figure 2 is a front elevation view of the receiver of this invention Figure 3 is a partial top plan view of the track assembly showing details of the track construction Figure 4 is a partial elevational cross section view of the receiver and track along the line 4 4 of Figure 2 receiver base and track assembly Figure 5 is a partial elevational cross section view showing details of the chain engagement means and the module interlock Figure 6 is a partial plan view of the details of Figure 5 Figure 7 is a partial plan view of a bin in the receiver Figure 8 is an end elevational view of the bin ofFigure 7 Figure 9 is a partial elevation cross section of a bin and purticalarly of its entrance end with respect to deflector sides on its feeder and Figure 10 is a partial front diagrammatic view of the receiver to further illustrate details of construction. Referring now to the drawings and particularly Figure 1, it will be seen that the receiver mechanism of this invention, generally designated by the number 10, is in position to receive paper copies from a duplicator or press device generally designated by the number 12 by way of a feeder mechanism generally designated by the number 14. The receiver 10 moves laterally on a track structure 16 in close proximity to the feeder. Feeder 14 includes infeed conveyor section 18, a proof tray assembly 20 and a control panel 22. The infeed conveyor directs paper copies either to an upwardly angled intermediate conveyor 24 or a downwardly angled intermediate conveyor 26. A tower section generally designated by the number 28 suports a vertically disposed reversible feeder conveyor, bin deflectors and guides described in detail in our copending European Patent Application No 79300625.5 for Feeding Mechanism for a Continuous Sorting achine which corresponds to U.S. Patent ApplicationSerial No 897,274 filed 17th April 1978. The tower section 28 is supported on a base section 30 shown in generally outlined form in Figure 1. It will be seen by reference to Figure 2 that the receiver 19 is comprised of a base section 40 having a bottom wall 41, and castors 42 and 46 with the castors 46 being located under the extension section 4 4 of the base 40. Upwardly extending side frame members 48 and 5O are interconnected at their upper end by frame top section 52. A centre frame piece 53 divides the receiver into two angled columnar spaces 54 and 56. The columnar spaces 54 and 56 include individual shelves or bins 140 which will be described more in detail hereinafter.The generally upstanding receiver structure has an entrance side 60 and an unloading or exit side 62.The frame is generally vertical in the plane of its entrance and exit sides and inclines at a predetermined angle in the direction of its movement. Extending across the depth of the machine from the entrance to the unloading side, as best seen in Figures 4 and 6, is an actuator rod 66 which is spaced Just above boLLoli wall 41 and which rod 66 is supported by bearing 68 at one end and bearing 70 on the exit side of the machine. Rod 66 can be seen to extend throuyh the base wall 40 to the exit side and on the outside is provided with a lualldle 72, which extends generally upwardly for easy access by the operator. Secured to rod 66 are a pair of depending engagement forks 74 which extend through an opening 76 in bottom wall 41. As can be seen, the forks 74 are spaced apart so that they will not interfere with the receiver chain drive on the support and drive track. handle 72 of the engagement rod 66 engages a notch 78 in a holding clip 80 secured to he center frame piece 53 on the unloading side. It will be noted that the handle 72 engages retainer notch 78 in the generally perpendicular position and in which position the forks 74 extend generally straight down. A spring latch member 80 is supported at its anchor end 82 by wall 41.The spring latch member has a generally horizontal section 84 which extends under rod 66 aiid towards that end of the base away from extension platform 44. An opening 86 is provided in base wall 41 to receive a coupler section 88 formed in the other end of the spring latch 80 with the latch 80 also having an angled end ramp 89. When handle 72 is in the vertical position, as sliown in Figure 5, spring latch 80 with the coupler section 88 is in its up position so that if a second modular unit 10 is being used the two units will be latched together.By pushing the second unit against the first thu pldtforlll 44 slides under the first unit and rid against ramp 89 to pull the latch down and engage the two receiver modules together. An opening is located in extension section 44 of each module which will slide under the opposite end of the base and will register with the opening 86. When the forks on rod 66 are straight down and thus engaged with the chain, as mentioned above, spring latch 80 is engaged. Rod 66 is provided with a flat which coincides with the latch when the modules are engaged.When the handle 72 is moved the flat on rod 66 moves out of registry and acts as a cam to force the latch down talus disengaging the receiver modules from each other.It will be noticed that the handle 72 is moved according to the direction which it is desired to roll the receiver.If an empty receiver is being rolled onto the track section, the handle will be moved in one direction so as to present the forks 74 at an rppropriate angle. If it is desired to roll the receiver off after it is filled, then the handle 72 is moved in the opposite direction to permit forks 74 to release from the chain mechanism. T e track section 16 includes a floor wall 100 with upstanding side channel 100 on the entrance side and upstanding channel 102 on the exit side. Supported on the floor wall 100 of the track section 16 are caster guide walls 104 for casters 42 and 46 and track guide walls 106 near side rail 102 for receiver the other casters 42, 46. The guide rails 104 and 106 can be seen in Figure 3 to be spread slightly at the incoming end of the track to fucilitato rolling an empty unit onto the track. Between the guide rail channelu for the casters is a drive motor 110 which through drive chain 112 turns a reduction 9ur which in turn drive a main chain pulluy 114. An idler chain pulley 116 is located at the other rid of the track section so that a continuous drive chain 118 extends around the chain pulleys 114 and 116. Secured to the chain as can be een in Figures 4, 5 and 6, is a transverse arm member 120 which is mounted on the chain such that it extends out on either side to be engaged by forks 74.When a new receiver has been rolled onto the track section, the handle 72, which controls the position of the engaging forks 74, is moved so that the forks are angled to allow the forks to engage member 120. As soon as engagement has been made, the bar is moved to the up riyht position to firmly secure the receiver to the chain. The controls will then by appropriate energizing signals to motor 110 position the receiver with respect to the feeder 14 to present a particular bin address such as bin number 1 in proper position for beginning a sorting operation. he bins, best shown in Figures 7 through 10, and generally identified by the number 140, have a generally upstanding entrance wall 142 which has an upper edge 144 which as can be seen is spaced a predetermined distance below the bin next above. The deflector guides 146 are part of che feeder and are in approximately the position shown in Figure 9, when the sorter is in operation.Thus, the entrance wall 142 is angled as at 148 and 150 to facilitate the entrance of sheets of paper which will be entering a bin either from above or from below depending upon whether the feeder is sending sheets over the top or around the bottom. The bins 140 have inain support wall or shelf portion 152 wiiich also can best be seen in Figure 7 to have a center cut away portion 154 which extends from the exit or unloading end 156 generally centrally thereof to an inner end 158 which as can be seen is a slightly more than half way toward the entrance end of the bin. The bins 140 are formed such that the shelf portion 152 is generally horizontal across the front. Extending diagonally from one side of the front to the opposite side at the unloading end is a line 160 which places the approximate other half of the shelf portion 152 at a slight downward angle to assist in moving paper into lined stacks in the bin. A side wall 162 is formed along the high side of the bin and on the opposite side is wall 164 along that side of the bin having the angled down section. At tl1e top and bottom of the sorter frame structure are two support rods 170, only one of which is shown in igure 7, which support releasable slide pieces 172.A belt member 174 attaches to the pieces 172 and extends through the cut out portion of the stack off bins to arrest the inotion of the sheets of paper after they enter the bins. The belt 174 is not a jogging device since the slanting of the bin selves is the primary factor in the alignment of the sleets of paper into neat stacks. Figure 10 indicates diagrammatically more detail about the arrangement of the bins. The bins are arranged so that tl1e bin ncxt below the bin next above is spaced laterally a specified amount as for instance .30 .242 inches depending upon the width of the bins in the particular receiver being used. The increment of distance by which the bins are laterally offset from each other is consistent down the entire length of the column from Bl to 1350. In like manner, the top bin B51 in the second column is spaced the same amount of distance laterally from B50 as the rest of the bins are from each other.The controls are set to index the motor or movement of the chain to present a particular bin dress from Bl throuh 13100 to a delivery position adjacent the feeder 14. Operation of the feeder and receiver is continuous and is best described as follows. A first or page 1 master is inserted in the press or duplicator. Several copies are first directed to the proof tray 20 and then the sorting job begins. Odd numbered pages coming out of the press are directed to lower intermediate conveyor 26 and up the feeder conveyor to the top bin. Sheets will be fed up the conveyor and deflected to the desired bin address by a deflector asud the lower surface of a Y shaped deflector. The receiver moves a discrete distance from left to right and presents the next bin address until all 50 bins in a column have been filled.If the sorting job extends to the next column copies continue to be fed to the feeder conveyor via lower intermediate conveyor 26 and up the feeder conveyor to the topmost bin in the second column. This topmost bin of the second column is offset from the lowermost bin of the first column by the same increment of distance as the bins are offset from each other in each column. Assuming that two complete columns of bins are being used for a sorting job, the feeder continuum to feed around the lower intermediate conveyor until all fifty biiis in the second column are filled.By the time the bottom most bin in the second column has received its copy of page 1 from the press, copies of the page 2 master are already proceeding up the upper intermediate conveyor 24. The feeder conveyor belts are reversed to bring the first sheet from the top to the bottom of the feeder conveyor and filling of the bins with copies of page 2 begins with the lowest bin in column 2 where the first page sorting job ended. Thus the feeding of bins is continuous not only from bin to bin but from column to column. Also, it can be appreciated that odd numbered pages from the duplicator are fed from the bottom up while the receiver indexes from left to right and even numbered pages are fed from the top down while the receiver moves from right to left. Obviously, also, two adjacent deflectors are needed for a single bin address. When coming down the conveyor sheets are deflected by th1e top one of two adjacent deflectors and directed against the top surface of a de lector guide and into the bin opening. When coming from the bottom the sheet is deflected by the lower one of two adjacent deflectors and off the lower surface of a deflector into the same bin address. Thus the need for one inore deflector tllan there are bins or guides.
