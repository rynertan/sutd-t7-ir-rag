# Coupling devices to containers for radioactive material.

## Abstract
A container having a neck 15 is engageable at that neck with a hoist termination 40. The container is supported at the neck 15 by a ball latch 12 in a shielding flask 11 from which it can be lowered through the base of the flask. The termina tion 40 is provided with a ball latch releasing rod 51 and a single handed raisable and lowerable sleeve 43 which in the raised position allows engagement of the hoist termination 40 and container neck 15 at screw threads 28, 42 but prevents operation of the releasing rod 51 and in the lowered position allows operation of the release rod 51 but prevents disen gagement of the hoist termination 40 and container neck 15.
