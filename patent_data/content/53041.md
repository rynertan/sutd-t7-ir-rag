# PROCESSES FOR PRODUCING HIGH GRADE ASPHALTIC MATERIALS FROM LOW GRADE BITUMINOUS MATERIALS AND PRODUCTS RESULTING THEREFROM

## Abstract
Disclosed is a process for producing high grade asphal tic materials from low grade bituminous materials and the improved products resulting therefrom. More particularly, there is disclosed a process for preparing novel high quality paving grade asphalt cements and novel roofing grade asphalts from poor and marginal quality bituminous mate rials by passing an oxidising gas through the bituminous starting material in the presence of a carbonate salt as catalyst, for example, sodium carbonate or bicarbonate. Other carbonates and sesquicarbonates may also be used.
