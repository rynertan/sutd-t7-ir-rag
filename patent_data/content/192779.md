# PEROVSKITE TYPE CERAMIC MATERIAL AND A PROCESS FOR PRODUCING THE SAME.

## Abstract
Two or more perovskite type ceramic materials of different compositions that have been pulverized, are pre baked separately to obtain two or more peroviskite type ceramic materials having large dielectric constants and different Curie temperatues. These materials are then pulver ized and are mixed in a ratio which may be arbitrarily selected, provided that every material is included in said mixture, i.e., no material may be omitted, and are sintered to prepare a perovskite type ceramic material without permit ting it to become a perfect solid solution. A ceramic material obtained by mixing and sintering a composition 0.1 of Pb Fe
