# Liquid cooled lance for blowing oxygen onto a steel bath.

## Abstract
A liquid cooled lance is used to blow a primary supply of oxygen at the surface of a molten steel bath to form a burning spot. A central duct in the lance delivers the primary supply of oxygen to the tip 1 . A secondary supply of oxygen is blown from nozzles 16 around the side of the lance to burn up CO from the burning spot and so heat the bath. Several conduits 8 run in parallel within the lance to deliver the secondary oxygen to the nozzles 16 . There is preferably one conduit per nozzle. The conduits 8 may run within an annular coolant duct, and preferably comprise, at least in part, pipes 9 in the form of a winding around the lance axis. This construction has good resistance to thermal expansion stresses.
