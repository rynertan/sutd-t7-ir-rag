In preparing the fumigating compositions of the present invention, the mixtures of active ingredients may be formulated, according to procedures thoroughly known to those skilled in the art using diluents for general insecticides, like in the case of conventional pyrethroids, into various forms of compositions such as heating fumigants e.g. mosquito coils, mosquito mats for electric fumigator and premix formulation for preparing them to be put to practical use. In the compositions of the present invention, the active ingredients are contained in an amount of 0.01 to 90 by weight. The compositions of the present invention can be enhanced in pesticidal efficacy when used in admixture with such synergists for pyrethroids as oc 2 2 butoxyethoxy ethoxyl 4,5 methylenedioxy 2 propyltoluene hereinafter referred to as piperonyl butoxide . N 2 ethylhexyl bicyclo 2,2,1 hepta 5 ene 2,3 dicarboximide hereinafter referred to as MGX 264 and octachlorodipropyl ether hereinafter referred to as S 421 , or with other known synergists effective for allethrin and pyrethrin. Generally, chrysanthemic acid ester type compounds are somewhat low in stability to light, heat and oxidation. Accordingly, when antioxidants or ultraviolet absorbers, e.g. phenol derivatives such as BHT butylated hydroxytoluene , bisphenol derivatives, arylamines such as phenyl a naphthylamine, phenyl B naphthylamine or a condensation product between phenetidine and acetone, or benzophenone type compounds are added in suitable amounts as stabilizers to the composition of the present invention, it is possible to obtain fumigating compositions which have been more stabilized in effectiveness.As to the names of compounds used as the above antioxidant, 2,6 di tert butyl 4 methylphenol, 2,2 methylenbis 6 tertbutyl 4 methylphenol , 2,2 methylenbis 6 tert butyl 4 ethylphenol , 4,4 methylenbis 2, 6 di tert butylphenol , 4 ,4 butylidenbis 6 tert butyl 3 methylphenol and 4,4 thiobis 6 tert butyl 3 methylphenol are listed. The preparation of the composition of this invention will be explained according to examples in the following. But, this invention is not restricted to the following examples.Example 1 After 0.3 g of BHT was added to each mixture consisting of 0.1 g compound 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 9 or 11 and 0.05 g compound 15 or 16 , the mixture was dissolved in 20 ml of methanol, and then uniformly mixed with 99.55 g of a mosquito coil carrier a 3 5 1 mixture of Tabu powder, pyrethrum marc and wood flour . The resulting mixture, after evaporation of methanol, was sufficiently kneaded with 150 ml of water, and then molded and dried to obtain each mosquito coil.Example 2 80 Parts of each of mixtures indicated inTable 7 below as the active ingredient was mixed with 10 parts of an emulsifier consisting of Himer BLZ brand name by Matsumoto Yushi company and Himer 1002Z brand name by Matsumoto Yushi company in a ratio of 9.5 0.5.Solvesso 150 brand name by Esso company was added to the mixture to make the total amount to 100 parts, thereby premix formulation for preparing of mosquito coil was obtained in the form of emusifiable concentrate.

The resulting mixture was molded and dried to obtain a mosquito coil of a certain concentration. The thus obtained coil, if necessary, may contain small quantities of a pigment such as Malachite Green and an antiseptic such as sodium dehydroacetate or dinitrophenol. Example 3 After 0.006 g of Yoshinox 425 the same as mentioned above was added to each mixture consisting of 0.015 g compound 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 9 , 11 or 13 and 0.01 g compound 15 or 16 , the mixture was dissolved in an appropriate amount of chloroform.

In the fibrous fumigating composition, the fibrous carrier such as glass wool or asbestos having similar properties can be used in addition to a pulp plate such as cotton lint paper or filter paper. Example 4 40 Parts of each of mixtures indicated in Table 8 below as the active ingredient were mixed with 10 parts of Yoshinox 425 the same as mentioned above . An organic solvent such as isopropyl myristate, isopropyl palmitate, hexyl laurylate or kerosene was added to the mixture to make the total amount to 100 parts, thereby premix formulations for fibrous fumigating compositions for electric fumigator were obtained. After the premix formulation obtained in the above was diluted with an appropriate amount of kerosene, a given amount of the thus prepared solution was homogeneously absorbed by a fibrous carrier described inExample 3, thereby each fibrous fumigating composition for electric fumigator was obtained. The thus obtained composition, if necessary, may contain a small quantity of a perfume or pigment such as allyl aminoanthraquinone, 1 ,4 diisopropyl aminoanthraquinone r 1,4 diamino anthraquinone, 1,4 dibutyl aminoanthraquinone or l amino4 anilinoanthraquinone.
