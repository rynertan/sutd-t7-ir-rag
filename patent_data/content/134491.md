## Description
HEAT SHRINKABLE COVERING MATERIAL FOR SPECIAL SHAPE PIPES AND OTHER ARTICLES BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1 Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a heat shrinkable covering material having a heat shrinkable crosslinked plastic layer and a specific adhesive layer, which is suitable for covering peripheral surfaces of various special shape pipes and other articles. 2 Description of the Prior Art A variety of special shape pipes such as elbow pipes, reducers, valves, T shaped pipes and flanged pipes are used in pipe arrangements for heavy chemical plants, district heating systems and pump stations and neighbouring equipments for pipelines for transportation of crude oil and natural gas. Conventional heat shrinkable covering materials having a hot melt adhesive layer have a poor adhesion at a high temperature. Therefore, when conventional heat shrinkable covering materials are applied to these special shape pipes and other articles, various problems are encountered.For example, when a conventional heat shrinkable covering material is applied to a special shape pipe and heated, the heat shrinkable covering material shrinks in the circumferential direction of the pipe and moreover, shear is considerably generated in the direction perpendicular to the heatshrinking direction of the covering material i.e., to the circumferential direction of the pipe according to the dimensional change due to the thermal shrinkage.Therefore, it often happens that the covering material deviates or peels from the surface of a part, to be covered, of the special shape pipe, or forms a vacant space in the part to be covered. Especially, in case of a reducer type pipe where the length of the periphery or outer diameter of the pipe is gradually reduced in one direction, if a heat shrinkable covering material having a high heat shrinkage ratio is wrapped around the reducer type pipe and both the ends were bonded and covered by a heat seal tape to form a cylinder and heat shrinking is effected, the covering material bonded to the periphery of the reducer by thermal shrinkage in the circumferential direction greatly shrinks also in the direction perpendicular to the heat shrinking direction at the heat shrinking step.Consequently, the conventional covering material slips into the portion of the pipe having a shorter circumference length and deviates from the part to be covered. In addition, when heat shrinking is effected, the adhesion of the bonded end portion of the conventional covering material becomes poor and hence the covering material is liable to be separated at the bonded portion. Furthermore, it is considerably difficult to cover the surface of a special portion such as a T shaped pipe, a blind flange, a valve surrounding portion or a mirror plate of a tank, which is often observed in a pipeline, a transportation pump station or a chemical industrial plant by a conventional method, and even if covering can be performed according to the conventional method, a covering layer is insufficient as an anticorrosive or protecting layer and the covering operation is difficult. Recently, there has been proposed a method in which a plastic sheet piece having an adhesive layer in the heated state to a local plane or curved surface of a material to be covered, such as mentioned above.However, when a plastic sheet is heated at a high temperature, uneven shrinkage or expansion or melting or softening is ordinarily caused, resulting in formation of wrinkles or occurrence of thermal breakage. Moreover, in the operation of covering a plastic sheet in the heated state to a part of the surface of a material to be covered, the plastic sheet having wrinkles formed thereon is covered on the material and it is substantially impossible to remove these wrinkles. Therefore, the resulting covering includes many voids on the bonded face of the sheet. Still further, even if a good covering is formed, the end portion of the covered sheet is readily peeled and turned up. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is a primary object of the present invention to provide a heat shrinkable covering material for special shape pipes, which is not accompanied by the above mentioned problems involved in heat shrinkable covering materials for special shape pipes. In the case where the heat shrinkable covering material is arranged around various special shape materials and heat shrinking is effected, since the adhesive layer maintains a high shear strength at temperatures for heat shrinking the covering material, the covering material bonded closely to the surfaces of the special shape pipes almost does not slip in the direction perpendicular to the heatshrinking direction at high temperatures for heat shrinking or almost no troubles such as partial peeling are caused. Another object of the present invention is to provide a heat shrinkable covering material wherein, since a heat bondable adhesive layer retaining a shear strength at a high temperature is formed on the heatshrinkable crosslinked plastic layer, at the covering operation where the crosslinked plastic layer is heated at a high temperature, the properties of the crosslinked plastic layer and the properties of the adhesive layer help each other, and formation of wrinkles or voids on the bonded surface is prevented in the heated state where the covering material is contacted with a part of a material to be covered. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a heat shrinkable covering material for special shape pipes, which comprises a laminate of a heat shrinkable crosslinked plastic layer and a heat bondable adhesive layer, wherein the adhesive layer on all or a part of one surface of the crosslinked plastic layer is composed mainly of an elastomeric material and has a bonding force expressed by a shear strength of about 2 0.001 to about 0.05 kg cm2 as determined according to ASTM D 1002 at a high temperature where the covering material exhibits a largest heat shrinking force.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The heat shrinkable covering material of the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. In principle, as shown in Figs. 1A and 1B, the heat shrinkable covering material 1 of the present invention is composed of a laminate of a heat shrinkable crosslinked plastic layer 2 and a specific heat bondable adhesive layer 3. The heat shrinkable crosslinked plastic layer may be any of films and sheets of known heat shrinkable crosslinked plastics and laminates thereof. The crosslinked plastic film or sheet used in the present invention has a heat shrinking temperature of about 80 to about 2000C, preferably about 90 to about 1800C, and thermal shrinkage ratio is about 3 to about 80 , preferably about 5 to about 70 . In the case where the heat shrinkable covering material is applied onto a special shape pipe, it is preferred that the crosslinked plastic layer has a thermal shrinkage ratio of about 20 to about 80 , more preferably about 30 to about 70 . In the case where the heat shrinkable covering material is applied onto a part of the surface of other articles, it is preferred that the crosslinked plastic layer has a thermal shrinkage ratio of about 3 to about 30 , more preferably 5 to 25 , and the crosslinked plastic layer has such a thermal shrinkability that thermal expansion owing to the linear thermal expansion coefficient is substantially cancelled at the time of heating for application. Namely, it is preferred that the thermal shrinkage ratio based on drawing at a high temperature be larger than an ordinary linear expansion ratio of a crosslinked plastic material in the undrawn state, which constitutes the crosslinked plastic layer.It is ordinarily preferred that the thermal shrinkage ratio be 1.5 to 7 times, more preferably 2 to 6 times, the linear expansion ratio. It is preferred that the crosslinking degree of the crosslinked polymer layer, expressed as the gel fraction described hereinafter, be about 20 to about 90 , more preferably about 25 to about 80 . The gel fraction is determined by putting a sample crosslinked plastic film or sheet into xylene, dissolving the sample in xylene by refluxing at about 1300C for about 10 hours, dividing the weight A g of the sample not dissolved in xylene by the weight B g of the whole sample and multiplying the obtained value by 100, as expressed by the following formula Gel fraction A B x 100 A crosslinked plastic layer preferably used in the present invention is, for example, a heat shrinkable crosslinked plastic film or sheet prepared by forming a thermoplastic resin such as polyethylene, pclypropylene, an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer, an ethylene propylene copolymer, polyvinyl chloride, a polyester or a polyamide nylon 6 or nylon 6,6 into a film or sheet by extrusion molding or the like, crosslinking the film or sheet by irradiation with radioactive rays such as electron beams, X rays or y rays or chemical reaction with an appropriate peroxide or the like, drawing the crosslinked film or sheet at about 80 to about 2000C and cooling the film or sheet in the drawn state. The adhesive layer used in the present invention is an adhesive layer composed mainly of an elastomeric material and has a bonding force expressed by a shear strength as determined according to ASTM D 1002 of about 0.001 to about 0.05 kg cm2, preferably about 0.005 to 0.04 kg cm2, at a high temperature where the heatshrinkable covering material or the heat shrinkable crosslinked plastic layer exhibits a largest heatshrinking force for example, a high temperature in the range of from about 80 to about 2000C . As pointed out above, the adhesive layer retains a bonding force shear strength at a high temperature, and it is preferred that the shear strength at a normal 2 temperature about 200C be about 0.8 to about 30 kg cm 2 more preferably about 1.0 to about 30 kg cm It is preferred that the adhesive layer should contain about 25 to about 75 by weight, more preferably about 30 to about 70 by weight, of an elastomer component, for example, an olefin elastomer such as a polyisobutene rubber IIR butyl rubber , an ethylenepropylene copolymer rubber EPR or an ethylene pro pylene flon conjugated diene copolymer rubber EPDM , a conjugated diene type elastomer such as a polybutadiene rubber, a polyisoprene rubber, a styrene butadiene copolymer rubber, an acrylonitrile butadiene copolymer rubber or a chloroprene rubber, or other non conjugated diene type elastomer such as a chlorosulfonated poly ethylene rubber, an acrylic rubber, an epichlorohydrin rubber, a chlorinated polyethylene rubber or a fluorinated polyethylene rubber. An olefin elastomer as mentioned above or a mixture of an olefin elastomer with other non conjugated diene elastomer and or a conjugated diene elastomer is especially preferred as the elastomer component of the adhesive layer. The adhesive layer may comprise other modifying polymer modifier customarily used for adhesives, a tackifier, an anti corrosive agent and an inorganic filler in addition to the above mentioned elastomer component. As the modifying polymer, there can be mentioned thermoplastic or liquid resins, which include, for example, olefin polymers such as polyethylene, an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer, an ethylene propylene copolymer, an acrylate ethylene copolymer, polypropylene and polybutene, and polyvinyl chloride, a polyamide and styrene polymers.As the tackifier, there can be mentioned, for example, rosin, a rosin derivative, a pinene resin, an aliphatic hydrocarbon resin homopolymer or copolymer of C5 fraction, pentene, isoprene or 1,3pentadiene , an aromatic hydrocarbon resin homopolymer or copolymer of Cg fraction, a styrene compound or an indene compound , an alicyclic hydrocarbon resin, a coumarone resin, a coumarone indene resin, a phenolic resin, a naphthenic oil and modified terpene. As the anti corrosive agent, there can be mentioned, for example, inorganic anti corrosive agents such as a metal chromate, a metal phosphate, a metal phosphite, a metal borate, a metal molybdate and a metal nitrite, and organic anti corrosive agents such as a metal salt of an aromatic carboxylic acid, an aliphatic or aromatic compound containing at least two hydroxyl groups and tannic acid.As the inorganic filler, there can be mentioned talc, calcium carbonate, silica, alumina, mica and carbon black. In the present invention, an adhesive layer composed of a heat bondable adhesive composition comprising about 30 to about 65 by weight of an olefin elastomer as described above, about 1 to about 20 by weight of a modifying polymer, about 10 to about 30 by weight of a tackifier and 0 to about 20 by weight of an inorganic filler is most preferred, because the bonding force shear strength at a normal temperature is at least about 1.0 kg cm2, the bonding force shear strength at high temperatures is at least about 0.005 kg cm2 at 800C 2 and at least about 0.01 kg cm2 at 1000C and the bonding force is n ot abruptly decreased at higher temperatures. In the covering material of the present invention, if the content of the elastomer component in the adhesive layer is too low, the shear strength is drastically reduced at a heat shrinking temperature higher than about 800c as in case of an ordinary hot melt adhesive.If the content of the elastomer component is too high, the bonding force after cooling to a normal temperature is low. Therefore, too high an elastomer component content and too low an elastomer component content are not preferred. The tackifier is incorporated for imparting a flowability and a tackiness to the adhesive. If the content of the tackifier is too low, these properties are not obtained. In the heat shrinkable covering material of the present invention, the adhesive layer having a high shear strength at a high temperature may be formed on the entire surface of one side of the heat shrinkable crosslinked plastic layer. If necessary, the above mentioned adhesive layer having a high shear strength at a high temperature may be formed as a first adhesive layer on a part of the crosslinked plastic sheet for example, the inner surface portion of the covering material contacted with the large diameter side in case of a pipe where the outer diameter is gradually reduced, or the inner surface portion of the covering material contacted with a neck of a branch in case of a T shaped pipe while an ordinary hot melt adhesive having a high bonding strength at a normal temperature is formed as a second adhesive layer on the portion contiguous to the first adhesive layer applied portion. For example, a hot melt type adhesive comprising 30 to 80 by weight of a thermoplastic resin such as polyethylene, polypropylene, an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer, an acrylonitrile ethylene copolymer, polyvinyl chloride, a polyester or a polyamide, 0 to 50 by weight of asphalt bitumen , 10 to 20 by weight of a tackifier and 0 to 20 by weight of an inorganic filler is preferred as the second adhesive layer, because this adhesive is excellent in the bonding force at a normal temperature shear strength of about 5 to about 30 kg cm2 and flows adaptively to small irregularities on the surface to be covered. The same tackifier, inorganic filler and other additive as mentioned above may be used for the second adhesive layer. It is preferred that the heat shrinkable crosslinked plastic layer has a thickness of 0.1 to 3.0 mm, more preferably 0.2 to 2.5 mm, and the adhesive layer has a thickness of 0.05 to 2.5 mm, more preferably 0.1 to 2 mm. Application of the heat shrinkable covering material of the present invention can be carried out, for example, in the following manner. In the case where a heatshrinkable covering material is applied onto a special shape pipe, as shown in Fig. 2, the heat shrinkable covering material 1 is wrapped around a special shape pipe reducer 4 covered with coating layers 5 and 5 of a plastic resin, and both the ends of the covering material 1 are lapped and connected by a heat seal tape 6 to form a cylinder. Then, as shown in Fig. 3, the cylindrical covering material 1 is heated by a flame of a gas burner to cause the covering material to adhere closely to the surface of the special shape pipe and then the covering material 1 is bonded to the surface of the pipe through an adhesive layer 3 of the covering material by heating.In this operation, the known covering material slips out from the coating layer 5 of a plastic resin on the larger outer diameter side of the special shape pipe at heat shrinking. On the other hand, the heat shrinkable covering material of the present invention has an adhesive layer having a high shear strength at a high temperature adopted at heat shrinking. Therefore, the heat shrinkable covering material does not slip off from the coating layer 5 of the plastic resin on the large diameter side of the special shape pipe, and both the ends of the covering material are not separated from each other. The heat shrinkable coating material of the present invention is not particularly limited to a rectangular sheet as shown in Fig. 1, but it is sufficient if the covering material has a shape adapted for the special configuration of the surface of a special pipe to be covered. For example, the covering material may have a trapezoid shape, a sector shape or other shape. In the case where the heat shrinkable covering material is applied onto a part of the surface such as plane surface, bent surface, curved surface, wavy surface or corner surface of a mirror plate of a tank, a blind flange or a neck of a T shaped pipe , the surface layer of a metal material to be covered is heated at a temperature of about 80 to about 2000C, and the adhesive layer side of the heat shrinkable covering material is applied to the heated surface of the metal material in sequence from one side of the sheet. Thus, the heatshrinkable covering material is placed in the heated state on a part of the surface of the material to be covered, followed by bonding and then cooling to a normal temperature. The plane configuration of this heat shrinkable covering material is not particularly critical, and the covering material may have a band like, rectangular, trapezoid, sector, circular or ellipsoidal shape. The present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the following examples and comparative examples. In the examples and comparative examples, the shear strength was determined according to the method of ASTMD 1002 by lapping two iron sheets 125 mm x 25 mm x 1.5 mm along 12 mm, applying an adhesive between the two sheets in the lapped portion, heating the assembly at 1300C for about 5 minutes to bond the iron sheets and simultaneously pulling the iron sheets at both the ends by a universal tensile tester. Example 1 An adhesive comprising 30 by weight of a butyl rubber, 25 by weight of an ethylene propylene nonconjugated diene copolymer rubber, 5 by weight of polybutene, 208 by weight of a coumarone indene resin and 10 by weight of talc was kneaded at a temperature of 1500C for 5 minutes and shaped into a sheet having a thickness of 1.5 mm by a roll. The shear strength of the adhesive sheet as measured 2 according to the above mentioned method was 0.029 kg cm at 800C and 0.014 kg cm2 at 105 to 1100C and the shear strength was not abruptly reduced at 110 to 1200C. The shear strength was 1.15 kg cm2 at 200C. The adhesive sheet was bonded to the entire surface of one side of a crosslinked plastic sheet having a thickness of 1.0 mm, a gel fraction of 60 , a thermal shrinkage ratio of 45 in the longitudinal direction and a heat shrinking temperature of 1050C to form a heatshrinkable covering sheet having Ã¡ thickness of 2.5 mm, a width of 1000 mm and a length of 2800 mm. As shown in Fig. 2, this heat shrinkable covering sheet was wrapped around a reducer type special shape pipe the outer diameter of the large diameter portion was 32 inches, the outer diameter of the small diameter portion was 24 inches and the length was 610 mm , and both the ends were bonded and covered by a heat seal tape to form a cylinder. The cylindrical covering material was heated at about 105 to about 1100C by a flame of a gas burner to effect heat shrinking and cause the covering material to adhere closely to the periphery of the special shape pipe. Heating was further conducted to bond the covering material to the periphery of the special shape pipe. In the above covering operation, the covering material did not slip off even on the large diameter side of the special shape pipe, and both the ends of the covering material were not separated from each other, and thus a good covering layer was formed on the pipe. Comparative Example 1 An adhesive sheet was prepared in the same manner as described in Example 1 except that a composition comprising 20 by weight of an ethylene propylene nonconjugated diene copolymer, 25 by weight of an ethyleneacrylate copolymer, 45 by weight of a coumarone indene resin and 10 by weight of a microcrystalline wax was used as the adhesive. 2 The shear strength was 0.124 kg cm at 800C and 2 0.001 kg cm at 105 to 1100C and the shear strength was drastically reduced at a temperature higher than 1100C. TheThe shear strength was 24.2 kg cm at 200C. A heat shrinkable covering sheet was prepared in the same manner as described in Example 1 by using this adhesive sheet, and the periphery of a reducer type special shape pipe was covered with the covering material in the same manner as described in Example 1. In this covering operation, when the cylindrical heat shrinkable covering sheet was heated at a temperature of at least 900C, abnormal deviation of the covering sheet was caused in the large diameter portion of the special shape pipe and a large area of the surface of the pipe was exposed. Example 2 A heat shrinkable covering sheet was prepared in the same manner as described in Example 1 except that a band like first adhesive layer having a width of about 150 mm, which was composed of the same adhesive as described in Example 1, was formed in parallel to one end edge in the longitudinal direction of the heatshrinkable covering sheet and a second adhesive layer composed of the same adhesive as described in ComparativeExample 1 was formed on the remaining surface band like surface having a width of about 850 mm of the covering sheet. This heat shrinkable covering sheet was covered on the periphery of a reducer type special shape pipe in the same manner as described in Example 1 except that the first adhesive layer was lapped on the coating layer of the large diameter portion of the special shape pipe. In this covering operation, large slip of the covering material was not caused even on the largediameter side of the special shape pipe, and a high bonding force at a normal temperature was attained in the portion where the diameter varied and thus a good covering layer was formed. Example 3 The same adhesive sheet as that prepared in Example 1 was bonded to the entire surface of one side of a crosslinked plastic sheet having a thickness of 1.0 mm, a gel fraction of 60 , a thermal shrinkage ratio of 20 in the longitudinal direction and a heat shrinking temperature of 1050C to form a heat shrinkable covering materil in the form of rectangular sheet having a thickness of 2.5 mm, a width of 200 mm and a length of 600 mm. A plurality of the so prepared heat shrinkage covering materials were cut so as to conform to the surface portion of a mirror plate portion of a cylindrical tank having an outer diameter of 600 mm, a length of 1000 mm and a mirror plate curvature radius of 1000 mm.The surface layer of the mirror plate portion of the tank was heated at about 105 to 1100C, and the adhesive layer sides of cut pieces of the heat shrinkable covering materials were contacted in succession to the heated surface of the mirror plate portion and lapped and then bonded to the surface of the mirror plate portion. Finally, the assembly was naturally cooled. In the covering operation, formation of wrinkles or voids or peeling was not caused, and thus a good covering layer was formed. Comparative Example 2 A covering sheet was prepared in the same manner as described in Example 3 except that a crosslinked plastic sheet having a thermal shrinkage ratio of substantially zero was used, and a mirror plate portion of a tank was covered with this covering sheet in the same manner as described in Example 3. In the covering operation, when the covering sheet was contacted with the surface of the mirror plate portion heated at about 105 to about 1100C, many wrinkles were formed on the covering sheet, whereby many voids were formed between the adhesive layer and the surface of the mirror plate portion.
