## Description
The present invention relates to flame retardant polyester and polyesterether compositions which have significantly reduced blooming of the flame retardant after molding, high temperature processability, reduced smoke generation, and superior heat aging. Thermoplastic polyesters and polyesterethers have become increasingly important in recent years due to their excellent processability and superior mechanical, chemical and electrical properties. Exemplary of such thermoplastic polyesters is poly butylene terephthalate PBT , which is prepared by the reaction of 1,4 butanediol and dimethyl terephthalate. PBT is commercially available from a variety of domestic and foreign sources. The physical properties of PBT, such as tensile and flexural strength and heat deflection temperature, are significantly enhanced by the addition of fiberglass to the composition. A representative thermoplastic polyesterether is Hytrel , which is manufactured and sold by the duPont Company. This material is a copolyester which is prepared by the reaction of dimethyl terephthalate, polyether glycol, and excess 1,4 butanediol. Hytrel is an elastomer which has superior tensile and flexural strength, abrasion resistance, and good electrical properties. Many commercial uses for thermoplastic polyesters and polyesterethers require a level of flame retardancy not present in the base resin. Such compositions are desired for applications such as in home construction, automobile and air craft manufacture, packaging, electrical equipment, and the like. To meet this demand, a wide variety of halogenated compounds have been used in these compositions to impart flame retardancy. Unfortunately, however, the addition of flame retardants to the resin has been at the expense of other physical properties which render the resin desirable, such as superior toughness and strength. Specifically, the use of conventional flame retardant additives can cause decreased flexural strength and heat distortion resistance, particularly in glass filled compositions. Accordingly, a flame retardant additive must be carefully selected not only on the basis of its principal function, i.e. flame retardancy, but also with regard to its effect on the other physical properties of the polymer composition. Many widely used flame retardants for PBT resin compositions, such as decabromodiphenyl ether, have a tendency to migrate to the surface of the molded article. This tendency, known as blooming , represents a physical loss of the flame retardant from the molded article and can result in a breakdown in the surface electrical characteristics of the molded part. See US A 4,373,047 which discusses this phenomenon and discloses the addition of an olefin polymer or copolymer to such compositions in order to reduce blooming of the flame retardant. The high processing temperatures required for molding thermoplastic polyester and polyesterether compositions also place constraints on the flame retardant additive which can be employed. Such processing temperatures are required to reduce cycle times, but often preclude the use of thermally unstable additives. Thermal instability can result in a deterioration in surface appearance as evidenced by an unsatisfactory color change in the molded article. It is also highly desirable to further improve upon other physical properties of the composition such as smoke generation and heat aging. Chlorinated bisimides such as those of the present invention have been disclosed as effective flame retardant additives for various polymers such as ABS and polyolefins. See, for instance, the disclosures in US A 4,374,22O, US A 3,877,974, US A 3,734,758, and GB A 1,287,934. However, none of these references discloses the use of the chlorinated bisimides of the present invention as flame retardants in thermoplastic polyesters or polyesterethers. Moreover, none of these references suggest that the incorporation of such chlorinated bisimides in these resins would also reduce or eliminate blooming, reduce thermal degradation under high temperature processing conditions significantly reduce smoke generation, and provide better heat aging. It is therefore a principal object of the present invention to provide superior non blooming, flame retardant thermoplastic polyester and polyesterether compositions which possess excellent processability and physical properties. In accordance with the present invention, thermoplastic polyester and polyesterether compositions are provided having improved flame retardance, smoke generation and heat aging, resistance to blooming, and high temperature processability. The thermoplastic polyester compositions comprise, in percent by weight, a from 40 to 75 of PBT, b from 0 to 10 of antimony trioxide, c from 0 to 35 of glass fiber, and d from 5 to 20 of a chlorinated bisimide The thermoplastic polyesterether compositions comprise, in percent by weight, a from 50 to 90 of a polyesterether elastomer prepared from dimethyl terephthalate, polyether glycol, and 1,4 butanediol, b from 0 to 40 of antimony trioxide, and c from 5 to 50 of a chlorinated bisimide of compounds I and II . The thermoplastic polyesters and polyesterethers suitable for use in the compositions of this invention are high performance plastics which are well known for their superior physical and chemical properties. Suitable thermoplastic polyesters are prepared by the ester interchange reaction of 1,4 butanediol and dimethyl terephthalate, followed by polymerization at high temperatures under vacuum with removal of excess butanediol. The resulting thermoplastic polyester is characterized by sequences of repeating tetramethylene terephthalate units and is commonly referred to by the generic name PBT poly butylene terephthalate . The properties of PBT are enhanced by incorporating glass fiber in the molding composition which results in increased strength, flexural modulus, heat deflection temperature, and UL temperature index. See Kirk Othmer, Suitable thermoplastic polyesterethers are prepared by the catalyzed melt transesterification reaction of a mixture of dimethyl terephthalate, polyether glycol, and excess 1,4 butanediol. Representative of such polyesterethers is Hytrel , which is manufactured and sold by the duPont Company. Hytrel polymers are elastomeric block copolymers having repeating units of tetramethylene terephthalate and poly alkylene ether terephthalate . Thermoplastic polyesterethers have superior tensile and tear strength, flex life, abrasion resistance, and good electrical properties. See Kirk Othmer, The flame retardant additives of this invention are chlorinated bisimides having the following formulas The chlorinated bisimide of formula I can be prepared by the reaction of chlorendic anhydride and ethylene diamine see US A 4,374,220. The preparation of this compound is more fully described in Example 1 below. In accordance with accepted international chemical nomenclature, this compound is designated as 2,2 1,2 ethanediyl bis 4,5,6,7,8,8 hexachloro 3a,4,7,7a tetrahydro 9Cl 4,7 methano 1H isoindol 1,3 2H dione. The compound of formula II can also be prepared by reacting hexolic anhydride and ethylene diamine see US A 3,748,340. The preparation of this compound is illustrated in Example 2 below. This compound is designated as 2,2 1,2 ethanediyl bis 5,6,7,8,10,10 hexachloro 3a,4,8,8a,9,9a hexahydro 9Cl 5,8 methano 1H benz F isoindole 1,3 2H dione. The thermoplastic polyester compositions of this invention comprise from 40 to 75 , and preferably 50 to 60 , by weight of PBT, and from 5 to 20 , preferably 10 to 15 , by weight of chlorinated bisimide. Antimony trioxide, in an amount of from 0 to 10 by weight, is also added to the molding composition as a synergist for enhanced flame retardancy. PBT molding compositions also typically include a substantial amount of glass fibers for improved physical properties, and the molding compositions of this invention can also include from 0 to 35 by weight of glass fibers. The thermoplastic polyesterether compositions of the present invention comprise from 50 to 90 , preferably from 70 to 90 , by weight of polyester ether, and from 5 to 50 , preferably from 10 to 15 , by weight of chlorinated bisimide. Antimony trioxide is also present in the molding composition as a synergistic flame retardant additive in an amount of from 0 to 40 by weight. The molding composition based on a polyesterether resin is an elastomer and does not normally include glass fiber. The components of the molding compositions as described above can be compounded to form an intimate mixture suitable for molding by various techniques known in the art. The components may be ground or pulverized, and the powder mixed in a conventional fashion to form a blend suitable for molding. Alternatively, the fire retardant components may be added and mixed with a molten polymer blend. The blend may then be molded, extruded, or otherwise formed into useful articles or shapes. The molding compounds are particularly adaptable for injection molding techniques. Furthermore, various other additives may be incorporated into the blend such as plasticizers, lubricants, fillers, dyes, pigments, mold release agents, antistatic agents, and the like. The molding compositions of the present invention offer the particular advantage of being resistant to blooming after being formed into a molded article. Resistance to blooming is an indication that the flame retardant is retained within the molded article and not exuded from the surface. Good resistance to blooming is essential for molded articles which must meet stringent UL requirements for self extinguishing compositions, and such articles are most frequently found in electrical applications. This resistance to blooming is surprising in view of the ease with which blooming occurs in compositions using related flame retardants such as decabromodiphenyl ether, decabromodiphenyl oxide, and Dechlorane Plus . A further advantage of the particular chlorinated bisimide designated by formula II is that thermoplastic polyester and polyesterether compositions containing this compound have outstanding thermal stability when molded at elevated temperatures, i.e. 232 C 450 F to 260 C 500 F . Such elevated molding temperatures are advantageous since they result in reduced cycle times and more efficient molding operations. The enhanced thermal stability of compositions using the chlorinated bisimide of formula II is surprising in view of the relative instability of compositions using the chlorinated bisimide of formula I . Still another advantage of the present molding compositions is their reduced smoke generation and superior heat aging in comparison to analogous materials such as the brominated bisimides disclosed in US A 4,374,220. The following examples are provided to further illustrate this invention and the manner in which it may be carried out. It will be understood, however, that the specific details given in the examples have been chosen for purposes of illustration only and are not to be construed as limiting the invention. In the examples, unless otherwise indicated, all parts and percentages are by weight and all temperatures are in degrees Celsius. Examples 1 and 2 illustrate, respectively, the preparation of 2,2 1,2 ethanediyl bis 4,5,6,7,8,8 hexachloro 3a,4,7,7a tetrahydro 9Cl 4,7 methano isoindol 1,3 2H dione and 2,2 1,2 ethanediyl bis 5,6,7,8,10,10 hexachloro 3a,4,8,8a,9,9a hexahydro 9Cl 5,8 methane 1H benz F isoindol 1,3 2H dione. Following the procedure of US A 4,374,220, 0.22 moles of chlorendic anhydride, 0.11 moles of ethylene diamine and 500 ml of xylene were added to a 1 liter flask equipped with a nitrogen purge, a heating mantle, a mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser and a Dean Stark apparatus. The mixture was refluxed for 1 2 hour during which time 3.2 ml of water was collected. The reaction mixture was cooled and filtered to give 68 yield of white crystals having a melting point of 354 C 356 C. Following the procedure of US A 3,748,340, 1500 ml of toluene and 425 grams 1.0 mole of hexolic anhydride were added to a 3 liter flask provided with a Dean Stark water trap, stirrer and heating mantle. 30 grams 0.5 moles of ethylene diamine in 200 ml of toluene was added dropwise to this mixture over a period of about 10 minutes, the temperature rising to 39 C. Heat was applied to the reaction mixture and the mixture was allowed to reflux. After refluxing for 8 hours, the reaction mixture was filtered hot and 276 grams of white, powdery crystals were obtained. Example 3 is a control example illustrating the preparation of a molding compound using a Hytrel resin and Dechlorane Plus 100 parts of Hytrel was mixed with 20 parts of Dechlorane Plus , 5 parts of antimony oxide, and 0.25 parts of carbon black, milled on a 2 roll mill to mix the materials, and then molded at 171 C 340 F into test bars on an injection molding machine. After molding, the samples were heat aged at 120 C. for up to 4 weeks. After aging for one week, visual inspection showed a white powder on the surface of the test bars which is indicative of bloom. The bloom got worse upon further heat aging for up to 4 weeks. Examples 4 and 5 illustrate the preparation of molding compounds according to the present invention using a Hytrel resin and the flame retardants of Examples 1 and 2, respectively. 100 parts of Hytrel was mixed with 16 parts of the compound of Example 1, 4 parts of antimony oxide and 1 part of carbon black, milled on a 2 roll mill to mix the material, and then molded at 171 C 340 F into test bars on an injection molding machine. After molding the samples were heat aged at 120 C for up to 4 weeks. No bloom on the samples was detected. 100 parts of Hytrel was mixed with 12 parts of the compound of Example 2, 3 parts of antimony oxide and 1 part of carbon black, milled on a 2 roll mill to mix the material, and then molded at 171 C 340 F into test bars on an injection molding machine. After molding the samples were heat aged at 120 C. for up to 4 weeks. No bloom on the samples was detected. Following the procedure of Examples 3, 4 and 5, injection molded test bars were prepared using Hytrel and various amounts of flame retardant, and evaluated for flame retardance, bloom and other physical properties. The results are shown in Table 1. These results demonstrate that the flame retardant additives of this invention do not bloom and are therefore superior to the flame retardant additives of the prior art. Examples 7 to 9 are control examples. Examples 10 and 11 illustrate the effect of molding temperature on the thermal stability of the molding compound. A change in color of the molded test bar indicates thermal degradation. 100 parts of Hytrel , 12 parts of the compound of Example 1, and 3 parts of antimony oxide were mixed and molded into test bars at various temperatures ranging from 171 C 340 F up to 260 C 500 F .

The results are set forth below. A comparison of the results of Examples 10 and 11 indicates that thermoplastic polyesterether molding compounds containing the flame retardant of Example 2 have more thermal stability than those using the flame retardant of Example 1.

Example 16 is a control example. Examples 17 and 18 illustrate A comparison of the results of Examples 17 and 18 indicates that thermoplastic polyester molding compounds containing the flame retardant of Example 2 have more thermal stability, even at a higher loading, than those using the flame retardant of Example 1. Examples 19 to 27 illustrate the effect on smoke generation of polyesterether molding compounds incorporating various flame retardants at various loading levels.

Example 30 is a control example.
