# Scirroscope.

## Abstract
The insertion end 30 of a scirroscope includes a sheath 3 a channel 4 for feeding water or passing a treatment instrument therethrough, an optics tube 6 in which an observation optical system is disposed, and a bundle 7 of optical fibers which defines an illumination optical system. An elastic member 21, 22, 23 covers either partly or entirely the internal periphery of the sheath 3 and or the external periphery of the channel 4 , the optics tube 6 and the fibre bundle 7 . This renders the scirroscope more robust and less prone to cracking during sterilization.
