# Vehicle seats with thigh supports.

## Abstract
A vehicle seat with an inflatable thigh support 28 in cludes an extension 24 which is hinged to a forward edge portion 14 of a seat cushion support 10 for movement between a fully lowered position and a fully raised position and various positions therebetween. The extension 24 is moved between its positions by an inflatable bladder 28 which is secured thereto and to the seat cushion support 10 . A foldable forward portion 54 of the seat cushion 20 over lies the bladder 28 . The inflation of the bladder 28 folds the foldable portion 54 of the cushion 28 as the extension 24 is raised, and provides a firm support for the thighs of a seat occupant.
