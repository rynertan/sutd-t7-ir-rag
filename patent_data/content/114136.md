# Ignition timing control system.

## Abstract
An ignition timing control system for an internal com bustion engine 18 varies the timing of a magneto 14 in accordance with a pre programmed ignition advance schedule. An optical pick up 22 senses the passage of slots 26 in a disc 24 which is rotated at the speed of a distributor 16 and produces constant angular width reference pulses corresponding to fixed ignition timing in the engine s cylin ders 13 . A magnetic pick up 36 detects incremental rota tion of the engine s crankshaft 33 and produces timing con trol signals proportional to engine speed. The timing control signals and reference pulses are converted to a multi bit data word which is used to synthesize an analog control func tion representing variable ignition timing using a pre programmed digital to analog converter 58 . A speed con trolled switch 70 gates ignition trigger signals correspond ing to the fixed timing of the reference pulses when engine speed is below a pre selected value but gates ignition trigger signals corresponding to the variable ignition timing of the pre programmed ignition advance schedule when engine speed exceeds the pre selected value.
