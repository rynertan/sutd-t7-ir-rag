# Noise reduction circuit arrangement of solid state video camera.

## Abstract
A noise reduction circuit arrangement for video signals under low brightness condition has a high pass filter 3A, 3B which detects the level of a video signal to switch the amount of passage of a high frequency band component in accord ance with a magnitude of the level. The video signal, produced from an image pickup element, is supplied to a low pass filter 2 and the high pass filter. The high frequency band component produced from the high pass filter and changed in amplitude in accordance with the level of the video signal and a low frequency band component produced from the low pass filter are added at an adder 10 so as to effect aperture correction in principle. The high frequency band to be added is so controlled as to more decrease when the brightness of the video signal is low than when the brightness is not low.
