## Description
APPLICATION FOR LETTERS PATENTUNDER THE EUROPEAN PATENT CONVENTiON lTITLE HYDROPNEUMATIC PULSE INTERCEPTOR DEStJRIPTIUN This invention relates to hydropneumatic apparatus as used for pump pulsation damping, pipeline shock absorption, pipeline fluid thermal expansion compensation, and the like. While referred to as a hydropneumatic pulse interceptor, such an apparatus is also referred to as a hydropneumatic accumulator. It is desirable to prevent the occurrence of capitation within positive displacement pumping chambers. Cavitation occurs on the suction strokes of positive displacement pumps because of the need to generate energy to accelerate the flow of liquid into the pumping chamber. The energy necessary to accelerate this flow may be considerable in a situation involving a long length of suction line and, consequently, a substantial volume of liquid. The ambient pressure applied to the liquid may not be sufficient to cause the acceleration of the suction flow. In these circumstances, the suction stroke of the pump turns some of the liquid being pumped into vapour and hence, for at least a portion of the suction stroke, the pumping chamber is not being filled.As a result of these circumstances, part of the pump delivery stroke is merely dissipated and results in forcing the vapour back into solution, The pump plunger then effectively encounters a solid wall of liquid which causes an abrupt shock or pulse to be emitted from the discharge port of the pump. It is known that when the circumstances mentioned above are prevented, the horsepower required to drive the pump can be reduced and the pump discharge flow can be sinusoidal rather than square wave in character. Various types of hydropneumatic accumulators are known in art. The applicant s prior United States patent No. 3 537 357 for example, teaches a hydropneumatic accumulator having a cylinder divided by a sliding piston which mounts a flexible diaphragm separating a compressible fluid from an incompressible fluid in the cylinder. Entry and exhaust ports are located at one end of the cylinder and on opposite sides of the longitudinal centre line of the accumulator.The compressible fluid gains contact with the diaphragm by passing through the centre of a conical end portion of the piston, While the hydropneumatic accumulator described in this United States patent No, 3 537 357 has found useful application in the industry, it has been noted that the conical end of the piston tends to deflect the pulses to some extent and this action prevents maximum cooperation of the incompressible fluid with the diaphragm. Furthermore, the arrangement described in the said United States patent No. 3 537 357 is not suitable for use with liquids containing solid particles.Nevertheless, the arrangement described in United States patent No. 3 537 357 is such that the mentioned diaphragm is prevented from extruding into the outlet port, which is a desirable characteristic for any accumulator utilizing a diaphragm. United States Patent No. 3 483 893 teaches another type of hydropneumatic accumulator having a single port which operates as both an inlet port and an outlet port for admitting and discharging an incompressible fluid being influenced by the accumulator.This single port within the accumulator connects, through multiple passages, to the interior of a flexible bag which is adapted to receive the incompressible fluid and is surrounded by a chamber filled with compressible fluid. The construction taught in UnitedStates patent No. 3 483 893 involves substantial costs because of having to make multiple entries for admitting the incompressible fluid to the bag and because of requiring an anti extrusion valve plate for each of the seats associated with the several passages that admit and discharge the incompressible fluid to and from the bag, so as to prevent any portion of the bag being extruded through any of such multiple entries and passages.Also, the construction described in the said United States patent No. 3 483 893 involves the provision of a bag of relatively complex cross section in order to achieve arcuate swinging of the mentioned anti extrusion valve plates towards and away from the seats associated with the multiple entries and passages. United States Patent No. 4 166 478 teaches both single port and ttin port type hydropneumatic accumulators. The accumulator construction employed in United States patent No. 3 483 893, employs a bladder into which the incompressible fluid is admitted and from which such incompressible fluid is discharged as line pressure conditions change.A perforated rigid shell member projects upwardly into the bottom of the bladder to prevent extrusion of the bladder into the port when the incompressible liquid is being discharged. Another type of hydropneumatic accumulator has been marketed by FLOWCHEM, Inc., of 1000 InstrumentDrive, Rocky Mount, North Carolina 27801, United States of America, under the trademark EYDROPLEX. One version of the HYDROFLEX accumulator comprises a cylinder one end of which is closed by a closely fitting plug which also supports a bag within the cylinder. The opposite end of the cylinder is fitted with a single port through which incompressible fluid is admitted and discharged into a chamber surrounding the bag, the bag being filled with a compressible fluid.The accumulator bag mounts, at its closed end opposite the single port, a so called button valve having a circular plate member of large diameter than the port and which acts to prevent extrusion of the bag into the port when the incompressible fluid is being discharged through the port from the cylinder. This version of the HYDROFLEs accumulator however does not provide either flow through the accumulator nor does it allow flow into the accumulator when the button valve is sealing the mentioned single port. Within the last few weeks, prior to this applicat ion, there has appeared on the market another type of hydropneumatic accumulator sold by Flowchem. Inc., and sold under the trademark JU OFLEX. The JUMBOFLEX accumulator, like the HZDROFLEX accumulator described above, has a cylinder with one end closed by a closefitting plug that supports a bag containing a compressible fluid. The opposite end of the cylinder is provided with a single port for admitting and discharging the incompressible fluid being influenced by the accumulator. The JUMBOFLEX accumulator also incorporates an anti extrusion button valve which operates in the manner described above for theHxDROFLEX accumulator. Increased tension on the bag when in its most extended position is provided by a suspension strap mounted within the bag and extends ing between the mentioned cylinder closure plug and a fitting within the bag and forming part of the button valve. The use of this suspension strap assists in preventing the button valve from prematurely covering the single port before the incompressible fluid has been discharged. With the foregoing in mind, the present invention has the manifold object of providing an accumulator having extreme pressure sensitivity, of providing an accumulator having a flow through path enabling the extreme pressure sensitivity of the accumulator to act upon the flow, of providing an accumulator which does not intercept and shut off the flow when in a non operational mode, of providing an accumulator having both inlet and outlet ports communicating with a portion of the cylinder adapted to receive and discharge the incompressible fluid and arranged so that the outlet port can be completely sealed without closing the inlet port, of providing an accumulator that can be manufactured from readily available materials compatible with the range of different liquids normally encountered in the application of accumulators, ssndndof providing an accumulator in which the bag or membrane member employed to contain the dompressible fluid is adapted to be mouldable from readily available elastomers and in a form of relatively simple cross section. With these objects in view, the present invention provides a hydropneumatic accumulator comprising a hydropneumatic accumulator comprising in combination a a hollow vessel having one end closed by first means and the opposite end closed by a removable base member b valve means associated with said vessel and a channel formed to permit entry of a compressible fluid therein c a flexible membrane member supported within said vessel and establishing, within said vessel and at one side of said membrane, a first fluid type chamber communicating with said channel and valve means, for receiving therein a compressible fluid admitted through said channel and valve means to hold said chamber at a predetermined pressure d inlet and outlet ports formed in said base member and enabling a substantially incompressible fluid to flow into said vessel through the inlet port, to contact selected portions of said membrane at the side thereof opposite said chamber while within said vessel, and thereafter to exit through said outlet port, said membrane being adapted to move in one direction toward said chamber and in an opposite direction toward said inlet and outlet ports in correspondence with changes in the character of said fluid flow and e an anti extrusion valve plate supported on said membrane at the said opposite side thereof and adapted, when said membrane is moved in its maximum position toward said inlet and outlet ports, to be supported on said base member within said vessel and provide a cover over both said ports to prevent extrusion of said membrane there through characterised in that said anti extrusion valve plate serves simultaneously to establish a flow path between said ports and partially bounded by said valve plate whereby the fluid entering said vessel through said inlet port is under all positions of said membrane provided with a path to flow out of said vessel through said outlet port. The invention is illustrated in two embodiments.One embodiment uses a membrane in the nature of a flexible diaphrag as a means of separating the compressible fluid from the incompressible fluid.Another embodiment provides a bag shaped membrane for the same purpose. Both embodiments are characterized by having the inlet and outlet ports located so that an anti extrusion valve can move to cover both ports to prevent extrusion of the bag or diaphragm but without interrupting the flow between the ports. Both embodiments are further characterized by the fact that, in all positions of the diaphragm or bag membrane, the incompressible fluid being influenced flows through the device. In one embodiment, the incoming incompressible fluid being influenced effectively sees and comes into contact primarily only with the surface of a flexible diaphragm thereby providing extreme sensitivity and minimizing the overall cost by reducing the need for special materials to compensate for corrosion effects and the like. In the specific embodiments illustrated, the inlet and outlet ports are formed by having the outlet port in the nature of a flared tube surrounded by an annular inlet port. Among other advantages, this port arrangement establishes a vortex type action within the device as the liquid flows there through, which enables the device to serve as a mixing device, in addition to performing the normal function of a hydropneumatic accumulator such as fluid damping, fluid shock absorbing, and fluid temperature compen station. In the diaphragm version of the invention, a plurality of elastic straps may be employed to support the diaphragm and allow the diaphragm to be attached to the accumulator vessel near to the exhaust port. In the other version, the bag is supported at a position more remote from the exhaust port by means of a tightly fitting plug.As will emerge from the following, Figs. 3 to 9 of the drawings show various aspects of the bag form and Figs. 10 to 16 show the diaphragm form of the invention in various constructions. The invention will be described further, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a block diagram illustrating a typical application of the hydropneumatic accumulator of the invention Fig. 2 is another block diagram illustrating how the hydropneumatic accumulator of the invention may be used as a mixing device Fig. 3 is a cross sectional elevational view illustrating a first embodiment of the accumulator of the invention, this embodiment utilizing a bagtype membrane Fig. 4 is a fragmentary view corresponding toFig. 3 but showing the bag in a more distended condition Fig. 5 is a view similar to Fig. 4 but showing the bag in a more compressed position, and also showing, in dotted lines, the position of its antiextrusion plate assembly in its lowest extreme position Fig. 6 is a somewhat enlarged cross sectional elevation of a nut member employed in the accumulator of Figs. 3, 4 and 5 Fig. 7 is an enlarged cross sectional elevation of an upper plate member employed in the accumulator of Figs 3, 4 and 5 Fig. 8 is an enlarged cross sectional elevation of a lower plate member employed in the accumulator of Figs. 3, 4 and 5 tig. 9 is an enlarged cross sectional elevation showing the entire anti extrusion plate assembly which comprises the components shown in Figs. 6, 7 and 8 of the embodiment of Figs. 3, 4 and S, together with a portion of the bag on which the valve assembly is supported rig. 10 is a cross sectional elevation illustrating a second embodiment of the accumulator of the invention, this embodiment utilizing a diaphragm type membrane with auxiliary elastic support straps with the anti extrusion valve, the diaphragm being shown in solid lines in its lowest position and in dotted lines in its highest position Fig. 11 is a side view of one of the elastic support straps employed in the accumulator illustrated in Fig. 10 Fig. 12 is a cross sectional elevation illustrating a third embodiment of the hydropneumatic accumulator of the invention, this embodiment also utilizing a diaphragm type membrane with auxiliary elastic support straps as in Fig. 10, but having an alternative form of one way valve and a thicker walled pressure vessel Fig. 13 is a fragmentary sectional elevation illustrating yet another embodiment which is similar to that of Fig. 12 but which has a thin walled pressure vessel Fig. 14 is a fragmentary sectional view showing an embodiment having a modified pressure vessel which is clamped by a victaulic type clamp device Fig. 15 is a fragmentary sectional view showing part of the embodiment of Fig. 12 and illustrating the employment of a protective thin liquid impervious and gas impervious layer or sheet, e.g. of Teflon, against the liquid. side of the membrane, thereby to enable the membrane to be exposed to a wide range of chemicals that might otherwise attack the conventional diaphragm material and Fig. 16 is a fragmentary sectional elevation illustrating yet another embodiment which has a combined diaphragm and valve plate, of which the valve plate is encased by the diaphragm. Figs. 1 and 2 of the drawings illustrate schematically how the hydropneumatic accumulator of the invention may be employed. Fig. 1 illustrates the more general application in which a substantially incompressible fluid from a liquid source 10, which may be at or above atmospheric pressure, is to be pumped, by a positive displacement pump 11, to a system 12 which utilizes the fluid. In this application, the hydropneumatic accumulator of the invention, generally designated by the numeral 15, is installed between the source 10 and the pump 11 to provide a smoothed sinusoidal flow as the output of the pump 11 as represented in Fig. lo The exact manner in which and how this result is obtained will be explained later. Another and unique application of the hydro pneumatic accumulator of the invention is schematically illustrated in Fig. 2. In this application, the fluid from the liquid source 10 in Fig. 2 is assumed to be combined with another fluid source from a metering pump 20 introducing, for example, a fluid catalyst. Further downstream, it is also assumed that an additonal fluid is to be combined with the fluids from the liquid source 10 and the metering pump 20 as illustrated by a second metering pump 21 introducing, for example, a colour in fluid form. The three sources of fluids are then illustrated, in Fig. 2, as providing a combined fluid flow which is introduced to the hydropneumatic accumulator 15 of the invention. In this application, the accumulator 15 serves both to mix the three fluids and also to eliminate the fluid pulsation before going on to the liquid utilizing system 12.Later description will deal with how both the mixing as well as the normal hydropneumatic functions are achieved. The invention is illustrated in one embodiment in Figs. 3 to 9 and in other embodiments in Figs. 10 to 16 with certain parts of the embodiments being interchangeable as later described. Referring firstly to Figs. 3 to 9, the first illustrated embodiment is a hydropneumatic accumulator indicated generally by the numeral 30 and comprises a cylindrical vessel 31 having one end closed by a elose fitting header plug 32. The plug 32 is arranged to support, internally of the vessel 31, a cup shaped bag 35 filled with a compressible fluid, e.g. a suitable gas such as nitrogen, and which is normally held at approximately 70 of the pressure in the line not shown in which the hydropneumatic accumulator 10 is to be employed. The bag 35 is formed with an internal bead 40 fitted in an external annular bead 40 fitted in an external annular bead groove 41 formed in the header plug 32. An anchorage rib 45 is fitted in an anchorage groove 46 in the plug 32.An 0 ring 50 fits in a groove 51 formed in the plug 32, and a segmental lock ring 55 is made up of three segments fitted in a groove 56 formed in the internal wall of the vessel 31 and arranged to seat on a recess 57 formed on the plug 32. An additional 0 ring 60 acts as a weather seal. A stop cock valve 65 connects to a port 66 to allow release of the fluid, e.g. nitrogen gas, contained within the bag 35, and a one way valve 67 connects to a port 68 to allow introduction of the gas, or other compressible fluid, into the bag 35 through the port 68. The accumulator 30 connects into the pipeline by means of an upstream flange connector 70 and an associated pipe 71. A downstream flange connector 72 and an associated pipe 73 provides a downstream pipeline connection. Incoming incompressible fluid, brought in by the pipe 71, enters the vessel 31 through an annular inlet port 80 surrounding a somewhat trumpet shaped and flared pipe end 81. This arrangement provides an outlet port 82 within and concentric to the inlet port 80. All the incompressible fluid influenced by the accumulator 30 is, therefore, forced into a flow through path, that is to say all of the fluid is directed into the inlet port 80 and out of the outlet port 82. Other advantages of this port configuration will also be pointed out as the description proceeds. An anti extrusion plate assembly, generally designated by the reference numeral 90, is supported on the lower end of the bag 35. This assembly 90 comprises an upper somewhat conically shaped plate member 91 having a hole 92, slightly upturned edges 93, and a smooth internal surface 94. A captive nut 95 fits in the hole 92 and thereby seats on the plate member 91, as can be seen in Fig. 9. The nut 95 has a threaded recess 96 which receives a bolt 97 which, in turn, extends through a hold 98 formed in the bottom end of the bag 35. A lower somewhat conically shaped plate member 100 is secured below the bottom end of the bag 35 and is formed with a hole 101 for receiving the bolt 97 to clamp lower portion 351 of the bag 35 between the plate member 91 and 100. An annular rib 105 on the upper internal surface of the bags lower portion 351 fits withina mating groove 106 to effect a fluid tight seal when the bolt 97 is tightened into the nut 95 by forcing the rib 105 into the groove 106 in the nut 95. Prior to describing the operation of the first embodiment of accumulator illustrated in Figs. 3 to 9, the construction employed in the second embodiment illustrated in Figs. 10 and 11 will be described, from which certain common constructional and operating characteristics will be better understood. The description of Figs. 12 to 16 will follow. Referring now to Figs. 10 and 11, the second embodiment provides a hydropneumatic accumulator, generally designated by the numeral 125, comprising a pressure vessel formed by an upper cup shaped cylindrical cap 126 secured to a mating circular base block 127. The block 127 is provided with an inlet pipe connection 128 and an outlet pipe connection 129 adapted to make respective upstream and downstream connections. The outlet pipe connection 129, in turn, communicates with an outlet pipe member 130 terminating in a trumpet shaped, flared end 131 surrounding an outlet port 132. The outlet pipe member 130, in turn, is accommodated within an annular cavity 135 hollowed out of base block 127 and surrounding the outlet pipe 130 in a concentric relation to provide the annular inlet port 136.The cap 126 and the block 127 are secured together by bolts 140 and effectively clamp in place the peripheral edge portion of a flexible diaphragm 141 having an annular bead 142 fitted sealingly in a groove 143 formed in an inner peripheral base portion of the cap 126. The diaphragm 141 thus establishes a chamber 150 for holding a compressible fluid, e.g. a gas, and separating such compressible fluid from a substantially incompressible fluid being influenced by the hydropneumatic accumulator 125. As further illustrated in Fig. 10, it will also be seen that the substantially incompressible fluid being influenced is held below the diaphragm 141 in a void surrounding the inlet port 136 and the outlet port 132. As with the embodiment of Figs. 2 to 9, the pressure within the chamber 150 is normally held at about 70 of the line pressure of the incompressible fluid. The diaphragm 141 supports an anti extrusion plate assembly 160 that is similar in operation and construction to the anti extrusion plate assembly 90 previously described in connection with Figs, 2 to 9.The plate assembly 160 of Fig. 10 includes a nut 161 having a threaded recess 162 for receiving a bolt 163 which extends through a hole 164 formed in the centre of the diaphragm 141. A bolt 163, in turn, acts to clamp central portion 1411 of the diaphragm 141 between an upper conically shaped plate 165 in which the nut 161 seats and a lower conically shaped plate 166. Fluid sealing is achieved by an annular rib 170 formed on the upper surface of the central portion 411 of the diaphragm 141 with the rib 170 being adapted to fit into a corresponding groove 171 formed in the bottom face of the nut 161. Auxiliary tensioned support for the diaphragm 141 is provided by a plurality of elastic straps 175 supported by an upper conically shaped plate 174 threaded onto the base portion of a valve 176. The valve 176 is designed so as to act as a one way valve for admission of a fluid into the chamber 150 and, like a tyre valve, is adapted to be released to reduce such pressure to an exact amount desired in a particular application. The straps 175 are moulded of an elastomeric material, e.g. natural or synthetic rubber, and have T shaped tangs 180 which are fitted into suitable holes 181 and 182 drilled in the plate members 165 and 174. After insertion into the respective holes 181 and 182 the respective tangs 180 will naturally flex outwardly and thereby serve to retain the respective ends of the straps 175 in position as illustrated in the drawings.The straps 175 enable the diaphragm 141 to be secured to the base block 127 near the outlet port 132 and with the anti extrusion plate assembly 160 acting to ensure that no portion of the diaphragm 141 can be extruded into the outlet port 132. Both of the described embodiments provide a gas backed membrane, i.e. the bag 35 or the diaphragm 141, of extreme pressure sensitivity. Both embodiments also ensure that the flow is through the accumulator, rather than remote from the accumulator, thereby enabling the extremely pressure sensitive membrane i.e, the bag 35 or the diaphragm 141, to act upon the flow. Another feature common to both of the embodiments is that the accumulator does not intercept and shut off the flow when in a non operational mode meaning that when the membrane, i.e. the bag 35 or the diaphragm 141 is drawn to the maximum extent towards the outlet port of the accumulator. It will also be understood that both embodiments allow the accumulator to be manufactured from readily available materials to enable compatibility with a wide range of liquid characteristics.Furthermore, both embodiments allow the membrane, i.e. the bag 35 or the diaphragm 141, to be moulded from conventional elastomers without requiring any adhesion or bonding operation for the production of the membrane or for its attachment to the containment vessel. In addition to the foregoing characteristics shared in common, it will also be appreciated that the second embodiment described in connection with Figs. 10 and 11 also provides a construction which enables the diaphragm to be secured near the outlet and thereby reduce the amount of internal vessel surface exposed to the liquid flowing through the accumulator. This arrangement provides both an exceptionally high degree of membrane sensitivity since the liquid effectively only sees membrane surface when it enters the accumulator.A further advantage is achieved in that the construction cost can be reduced when the accumulator is applied to handling corrosive and like special fluids. Other advantages attach to the Fig.12 to 16 constructions, as will emerge later. A most important characteristic associated with both embodiments is that the illustrated concentric inlet outlet port arrangement, in conjunction with the illustrated anti extrusion assembly arrangement, enables both of the ports to be covered by the valve plate, i.e. the valve plate 100 of Fig. 8 or the valve plate 166 of Fig. 10, but without interfering with free flow of the liquid between the two ports. Thus, in the inoperative dotted line position of the antiextrusion plate assembly shown in Fig. 9, it will be noted that outer diameter D l of the lower plate member 100 exceeds, and thus provides an area greater than, the area provided by outer diameter D 2 of the inlet port 80. Also, from Fig. 10 it will be noted that outer diameter D 3 of the lower plate 166 is greater than outer diameter D 4 of the inlet port 136. When the line pressure is greater than the gaseous pressure set on the gaseous side of the membrane, i.e. within the bag 35 or above the diaphragm 141, in the chamber 150 Fig. 10 the membrane is enabled to contract as a result of flow coming into the accumulator as indicated in the solid line positions shown inFigs. 5 and 11 and in the dotted line position shown in Fig. 10. Also, the membrane, iee the bag 3, or the diaphragm 141, can readily expand at intervals to provide the intermittent discharge instantaneously required by the suction stroke of an adjacent pump as illustrated by the distended condition of the bag 35 in Fig. 4 and the maximum expanded condition of the diaphragm 141 in Fig. 10. In operation, the first suction stroke of the pump will cause the membrane, i.e. the bag 35 or the membrane 141, to expand thus providing the suction volume required by the pump. The expansion of the gas on the gas side of the membrane results in a slight decrease in pressure within the gas chamber, i.e. within the bag 35 or the chamber 150 above the diaphragm 141. As a result, replacement liquid will start to flow from the suction source. Upon the next suction stroke of the pump, a similar set of circumstances will apply. However, no substantial force will have been applied to prevent continuous flow from the suction source into the accumulator.Consequently, over a period of time, the flow rate from the suction source into the accomulator will become relatively constant at the mean level of requirement and the accumulator will emit intermittent short bursts of liquid at the velocity required by the suction stroke of the pump. In practice, this will mean that the suction strokes of the pump will result in complete filling of the pumping chamber which now no longer has to accelerate the whole body of the liquid in order to obtain its supply. Therefore, since the pump is completely filled when the discharge stroke takes place, the primary part of that stroke will not merely be dissipated by causing liquid vapour to change back from vapour to liquid. Hence, there will not be a point in the discharge stroke when the pump plunger, piston or diaphragm meets a solid wall of liquid and, hence, suddenly emits a pulse with a shock wave imposed thereon.Thus, when the accumulator of the invention is applied to the suction side of a positive displacement pump, any pulsations emitted from the pump will be at a relatively low level which may be easily attenuated by another accumulator of the type provided by the invention but, then, can be of a much smaller size than would otherwise be necessary. Another advantage and benefit of the accumulator of the invention arises when the accumulator is used in a liquid process system where liquid is being transmitted from a pump which has multiple displacers, plungers, pistons, diaphragms, vanes, lobes, or the like. These multiple elements necessarily cause a higher pulsation frequency and noise than could readily enter and leave and, thus, be attenuated edge by a single ported pulse attenuating bottle attached to the liquid duct by a T connection. The accumulator of the invention, with its inlet outlet flowthrough arrangement, thus provides a significant advance in the art in dealing with high frequency pulsations of this type. The accumulator of the invention is also capable of intercepting a shock travelling down a line, which shock would otherwise by pass a single ported attentuating device. In this regard, it will be noted that use of a trumpet shaped flared inner concentric duct, i.e. the outlet port 81 in rig. 3 or the outlet port 132 in Fig. 10, causes any pulse or shock entering the accumulator through the inlet port, i.e. through the pipe 71 in Sig. 3 or through the inlet pipe connection 12tor in rig. 10, to be directed outwardly towards the space between the anti extrusion valve plate, i.e. the plate member 100 in Fig. 3 or the valve plate 166 in rig. 10, and the vessel wall and will, therefore, come immediately into contact with the membrane itself, i.e. the bag 35 or diaphragm 141, and hence be absorbed or attenuated. The concentric inlet outlet port arrangement illustrated in the drawings for both embodiments also provides a further benefit by creating a mixing action. In this regard, it may be noted that part of the flow of liquid coming into the accumulator will go freely into the interior of the vessel whereas other portions of the liquid are necessarily forced to flow around the outside of the concentric outlet pipe, i.e. the pipe 73 in Fig. 3 or the pipe 130 inFig. 10, before entering the interior of the vessel and therefore there is a time lapse effect imposed on the various constituent parts of the incoming flow.The trumpet shaped flared opening provided on the outlet port, i.e. the port 82 in Fig. 3 or the port 132 in Fig. 10, effectively provides a funnel of naturally decreasing cross sectional area which imparts a vortex motion to the exiting flow. Within the vessel interior there will have occurred a dramatic velocity change for all portions of the fluid.It will, therefore, be appreciated that, if the fluid entering the accumulator comprises a number of different substances to be mixed, the combination of the varying flow path distances, the time lapse effect caused by flowing around the outside of the internal funnel, the velocity drop within the interior of the vessel, the sharp edged annular orifice effect of the funnel lip, and the imparted vortex motion, all combine to subject the liquid to a thorough mixing. Thus, the hydropneumatic accumulator of the invention performs not only its normal functions, but also provides a mixing function which proceeds while performing those other functions for which the accumulator is primarily intended. It will be noted that, in both of the described embodiments, the anti extrusion plate assembly incorporates a bolt, i.e. the bolt 97 Fig. 9 or the bolt 163 Fig. 10 , which extends through a hole in the centre of the membrane, i.e. the bag 35 or the diaphragm 141. The moulding of the membrane with, in its centre, a hole through which the anti extrusion valve plate bolt extends, is important as it enables the usual core of the mould tool to be stabilized at its substantially unsupported end by a location pin within the mould tools cavity. This stabilizing effect enables extremely high, typically 20,000 psi about 1400 kg sq.cm to 40,000 psi about 2800 kg sq.cm elastomer injection pressures to be used without the substantially unsupported end of the mould tool core moving and causing variations to the thickness of the membrane. These pressures are typically necessary when attempting to mould the membranes in chemical resistant perfluoroelastomers. Thus, the accumulator of the invention is of special advantage in the process industries in which it is desirable to have membranes which are mouldable in all known elastomers to meet widely varylng compatibility requirements. The sensitivity of the hydropneumatic pulse interceptor accumulator of the invention can be appreciated more particularly from Figs. 3, 4 and 5. In Fig. 3, bag 35 is positioned as it might be in equilibrium as a suction damper at the moment when flow from the left has just been overtaken by the beginning of the pump suction stroke velocity with flow going to the right. Fig. 4 shows the bag 35 in a more distended condition as when in use as a suction velocity stabilizer with a tank connected to the left and a pump intake to the right, supplying a fast slurp on the suction stroke. In Fig. 5, the bag 35 is shown in a more compressed condition in solid lines as when applied as a suction damper and as the bag 35 would be positioned at the end of the cycle, enabling continuous flow from a tank connected to the left but before the suction of the pump eonnected to the right has begun.The diaphragm 141, like the bag 35, also serves as a flexible membrane and thus in the same manner provides a high degree of response and sensitivity in the diaphragm embodiment illustrated in Figs. 10 and 11, as well as in other forms of the diaphragm eiabodiments shown in Figs. 12 to 16 which will shortly be described As is well known to those skilled in the art, a hydropneumatic pulse interceptor and hydropneumatic accumulator apparatus, in general, is required to be adaptable to a variety of pressure and fluid conditions. Also, many fluids required to be handled have corrosive or other properties which require that the choice of material in contact with the fluid should be compatible with the nature of the fluid.Figs. 12 to 16 illustrate a range of constructions adapted to the diaphragm embodiment of the accumulator of the invention and thus illustrate the versatility of the invention to a relatively wide range of applications. Referring to Fig. 12, accumulator 200 shown, therein has a one piece relatively thick cap 201 and a relatively thick base block 202 which are secured together by a lock ring 203. ASME standards relate thickness to diameter. A diameter of 8 approximately 20 cm may be assumed for reference. Thus, a relatively thick walled compressiblefluid containing pressure vessel is formed as compared to the relatively thin walled compressible fluidcontaining vessel shown in Fig. 10. A thick wall as referred to here might be, for example, 0.625 inches about 1.6 cm thick whereas a thin wall might be, for example, 0.150 inches about 0.4 cm thick. Diaphragm l41a is substantially identical to the diaphragm 141 of Fig. 10 as previously described.However, it will be noted that the diaphragm 141a employs an annular bead 142 fitting into groove 1431 in the base block 202 and an anchorage rib 204 fitted into an anchorage groove 205 in the base block 202. Anti extrusion plate assembly 1601 is identical to the anti extrusion plate assembly 160 of Fig. 10 and operates as previously described. The plate assembly 1601 is suspended from upper conicallyshaped plate 1741 by elastic straps 1751. In the form of the invention previously described with reference to Fig. 10, four of such straps 175 were assumed to be employed whereas, in the construction of Fig. 12, only two such straps 1751 are employed.One way valve structure 210 of the embodiment ofFig. 12 replaces the valve 176 of the Fig. 10 construction and is deemed best suited to relativelyhigh gas pressures. The valve 210 has a body portion 211 which has an external threaded portion 212 which is threadedly received by the cap 201 of the accumulator 200. Head portion 213 of the valve 210 is of sufficient diameter to maintain the upper conical shaped plate 1741 thereon. upper angled sides 214 mate with the interior angled sides of the plate 1741. An 0 ring 215 is employed to eliminate any leakage between the cap 201 and the body 211. The valve mechanism is designed to act as a one way valve for admission of a fluid into chamber 1501 and, like a tyre valve, is adapted to be released to reduce such pressure to an exact amount desired in any particular application. The base block 202 is provided with a tubular extension 220 which is welded to the block 202 by a weld seam 221. The extension 220 has a flange 230 welded thereto at its outermost and, for receiving an appropriate pipe connection. An inlet pipe 222 extends through an appropriate opening in the extension 220 and is welded along a seam 223. A flange 224 is welded to outside end portion of the pipe 222, for making another pipe connection.Inside end portion 225 of the pipe 222 is angled and receives, in mating relation, the angled end of trumpet shaped pipe member 1301. Flared end 1311 of the outlet pipe member 1301 is disposed within annular cavity 1351 hollowed out of base member 202 and surrounding pipe member 1301 in a concentric relation, to provide annular inlet port 1361. As previously stated, the cap 201 and the base block 202 are secured together by the lock ring 203 and effectively lock or clamp in place the annular bead 1421 and the anchorage rib 204 of the diaphragm 141a. Diaphragm 141a thus establishes a chamber 150 for holding a compressible fluid, e.g. a gas, and separating such compressible fluid from the substantially incompressible fluid being influenced by the hydropneumatic accumulator 200. As further illustrated in Fig. 12, it will be seen that the substantially incompressible fluid being influenced is held below the diaphragm 141a in the void surrounding the inlet port 1361 and the outlet port 1321. As with the constructions previously described, the pressure within chamber 150 is normally held at about seventy percent of line pressure. Fig. 12 thus illustrates use of a relativelythick or heavy walled cap, whereas Fig. 13 illustrates use of a relatively thin walled cap for confining gas at a lesser pressure. In Fig. 13 cap 201 is composed of a lower thick walled section 231 welded by weld 233 to an upper thin walled section 232. In order to fit into the thin walled section 232 the valve 210 of Fig. 12 is modified slightly for the construction of Fig. 13. Valve 2101 for use with the thin walled cap 2011 has a shortened length body portion 21it. As a further modification as compared to Fig. 12, 0 ring 215 is seated in a 1 1 groove 234 in head portion 2131 of the valve 2101. ring 2151 prevents leakage between the cap portion 232 and the head portion 213 . All other members, i. e. the diaphragm 141a, the plate 1741, the straps 1751, and the plate assembly 1601 are identical in structure and operation to those of the construction illustrated in Fig. 12. Thus, dependent on the application, either a thin wall or thick wall type gas pressure vessel may be provided for purposes of the invention. Fig. 14 offers a further variation from the arrangements of Figs. 12 and 13. The lower portion 231 of the Fig. 13 embodiment is modified so that diaphragm 14111 is held in place by a portion 2311 against a modified base block 202 . Such an arrangement has a distinct advantage in the food industry where minimizing, and preferably elimination, of all grooves or other areas where food might collect is a prime necessity. For this purpose, victaulic type clamps 240 are employed in the Fig. 14 construction as the means for locking the base block 2021 and the 2311 11 lower portion 2311 together. The diaphragm 1411l has an annular lip 241 which fits into a groove 242 in the lower portion 231 . The diaphragm 141 provides a tight fit between the diaphragm 14111 and the base portion 202 and essentially eliminates any area that might otherwise collect food.The victaulic clamp 240 is composed of a pair of circular bands 243 having wedge members 245, 246 which fit with mating sloped edges 247, 248 and are held together by bolts 249 and nuts 249a in known manner. As previously mentioned, the handling of some fluids is particularly difficult because of corrosive or other chemical characteristics. The Fig. 15 construction provides a slightly modified construction which is identical to the accumulator 200 of Fig. 12 except for the addition of a thin protective, flexible sheet 250 secured between the lower conically shaped plate and the diaphragm 141a so as to protect the diaphragm 141a form liquid contact. The sheet 250 should preferably be made of a material which essentially exhibits no tendency to react with any fluid expected to flow through the accumulator.Flexible Teflon sheet has been found especially suited for this purpose. The sheet 250 lies against and protects the diaphragm 141a on its inside surface adjacent the lower conically shaped plate. The sheet 250 has an anchorage rib 251 which mates with the anchorage rib 204 of the diaphragm l41a and resides in the anchorage groove 205 in the base block 202. Also, the sheet 250 has an annular bead 252 which mates with annular bead 1421 and fits into groove 1431 in the base block 202. The Teflon sheet 250 is extremely useful in instances where the fluid being moved through the accumulator should preferably be kept out of contact with any portion of diaphragm 1411. Clinical liquids provide an example of such an application.Thus, by providing a relativelyinexpensive sheet 250 of a material which is compatible with the liquid being handled and of sufficient size so as to allow the diaphragm 141a to perform its normal function, these types of application are readily dealt with by the invention. Fig. 16 provides a combined diaphragm and lower conically shaped plate. Diaphragm plate member 260 is also useful with clinical or like liquids which might otherwise react with the material of the conically shaped plate member 261. The plate member 260 employs a moulded elastomeric material 262 arranged so as completely to surround the plate member 261. The diaphragm plate member 260 has an anchorage rib 263 and an annular bead 264 moulded therewith. The construction of Fig. 16 is particularly useful where it is desired to reduce the amount of relatively expensive metallic material in contact with the liquid being influenced, thus producing a substantially less expensive apparatus for such applications, The straps 175 may be secured by appropriately shaped and moulded tabs 265.
