Agriculturally suitable salts of compounds of Formula I are also useful herbicides and can be prepared in a number of ways known to the art. For example, metal salts can be made by contacting copounds of Formula I with a solution of an alkali or alkaline earth metal salt having a sufficiently basic anion e.g. hydroxide, alkoxide, carbonate or hydride . Quaternary amine salts can be made by similar techniques. Salts of compounds of Formula I can also be prepared by exchange of one cation for another. Cationic exchange can be effected by direct contacting of an aqueous solution of a salt of a compound of Formula I e.g., alkali metal or quaternary amine salt with a solution containing the cation to be exchanged. This method is most effective when the desired salt containing the exchanged cation is insoluble in water, e.g., a copper salt, and can be separated by filtration. Exchange may also be effected by passing an aqueous solution of a salt of a compound of Formula I e.g., an alkali metal or quaternary amine salt through a column packed with a cation exchange resin containing the cation to be exchanged. In this method, the cation of the resin is exchanged for that of the original salt of the resin is exchanged for that of the original salt and the desired product is eluted from the column. This method is particularly useful when the desired salt is water soluble, e.g., a potassium, sodium or calcium salt. Acid addition salts, useful in this invention, can be obtained by reacting a compound of Formula I with a suitable acid. e.g., p toluenesulfonic acid, trichloroacetic acid or the like. The preparation of the compounds of this invention is further illustrated by the following examples. A mixture of 27 g of N 1,1 dimethylethyl 2 methoxy 5 methylbenzenesulfonamide E. H.

The compounds depicted in these tables may be prepared by methods described in Examples 1 9, or by modifications thereof apparent to those skilled in the art. Useful formulations of the compounds of Formula I can be prepared in conventional ways. They include dusts, granules, pellets, solutions, suspensions, emulsions, wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates and the like. Many of these may be applied directly. Sprayable formulations can be extended in suitable media and used at spray volumes of from a few liters to several hundred liters per hectare. High strength compositions are primarily used as intermediates for further formulation. The formulations, broadly, contain about 0.1 to 99 by weight of active ingredient s and at least one of a about 0.1 to 20 surfactant s and b about 1 to 99.9 solid or liquid inert diluent s . More specifically, they will contain these ingredients in the following approximate proportions Lower or higher levels of active ingredient can, of course, be present depending on the intended use and the physical properties of the compound. Higher ratios of surfactant to active ingredient are somtimes desirable, and are achieved by incorporation into the formulation or by tank mixing. Typical solid diluents are described in Watkins, et al., Handbook of Insecticide Dust Diluents and Carriers , 2nd Ed., Dorland Books, Caldwell, New Jersey, but other solids, either mined or manufactured, may be used. The more absorptive diluents are preferred for wettable powders and the denser ones for dusts. Typical liquid diluents and solvents are described in Marsden, Solvents Guide, 2nd Ed., Interscience, New York, 1950. Solubility under 0.1 is preferred for suspension concentrates solution concentrates are preferably stable against phase separation at 0 C. McCutcheon s Detergents and Emulsifiers Annual , MC Publishing Corp., Ridgewood, New Jersey, as well as Sisely and Wood, Encyclopedia of Surface Active Agents , Chemical Publishing Co., Inc., New York, 1964, list surfactants and recommended uses. All formulations can contain minor amounts of additives to reduce foaming, caking, corrosion, microbiological growth, etc. The methods of making such compositions are well known. Solutions are prepared by simply mixing the ingredients. Fine solid compositions are made by blending and, usually, grinding as in a hammer or fluid energy mill. Suspensions are prepared by wet milling see, for example, Littler, U.S. Patent 3,060,084 . Granules and pellets may be made by spraying the active material upon preformed granular carriers or by agglomeration techniques. See J. E. Browning, Agglomeration , For further information regarding the art of formulation, see for example In the following examples, all parts are by weight unless otherwise indicated. The surfactant is sprayed upon the active ingredient in a blender and the mixture sifted through a U. S. S. no. 40 sieve 0.42 mm openings prior to packaging. The concentrate may be formulated further for practical use. The ingredients are thoroughly blended. The liquid surfactant is added by spraying upon the solid ingredients in the blender. After grinding in a hammer mill to produce particles essentially all below 100 microns, the material is reblended and sifted through a U.S.S. No. 50 sieve 0.3 mm opening and packaged. The ingredients are blended and ground together in a sand mill to produce particles essentially all under 5 microns in size. The ingredients are combined and ground together in a sand mill to produce particles essentially all below 3 microns. The product can be used directly, extended with oils, or emulsified in water. The ingredients are ground together in a sand mill until the solid particles have been reduced to under about 5 microns. The resulting thick suspension may be applied directly, but preferably after being extended with oils or emulsified in water. The ingredients are ground together in a ball or roller mill until the solid particles have been reduced to diameters under 10 microns. The ingredients are thoroughly blende, passed through an air mill, to produce an average particle size under 15 microns, reblended, and sifted through a U.S.S. No. 50 sieve 0.3 mm opening before packaging. All compounds of the invention may be formulated in the same manner. The ingredients are blended in a rotating mixer and water sprayed on to accomplish granulation. When most of the material has reached the desired range of 1.0 to 0.42 cm U.S.S. 18 to 40 sieves , the granules are removed, dried, and screened. Oversized material is crushed to produce additional material in the desired range. These granules contain 6 active ingredient. The ingredients are blended, coarsely hammer milled and the air milled to produce particles of active essentially all below 10 microns in diameter. The product is reblended before packaging. The ingredients are blended, hammer milled and then moistened with about 12 water. The mixture is extruded as cylinders about 3 mm diameter which are cut to produce pellets about 3 mm long. These may be used directly after drying, or the dried pellets may be crushed to pass a U.S.S. No. 20 sieve 0.84 mm openings . The granules held on a U.S.S. No. 40 sieve 0.42 mm openings may be packaged for use and the fines recycled. The ingredients are blended and then ground in a hammermill to produce particles with an average particle size less than 25 microns in diameter. The material is reblended and sifted through a U.S.S. No. 50 sieve 0.3 mm opening before being packaged. The ingredients are blended and ground in a hammer mill to produce a high strength concentrate essentially all passing a U.S.S. No. 50 sieve 0.3 mm openings . This material may then be formulated in a variety of ways. Test results indicate that the compounds of the present invention are highly active preemergent or postemergent herbicides or plant growth regulants. Many of them have utility for broad spectrum pre and or post emergence weed control in areas where complete control of all vegetation is desired, such as around fuel storage tanks, ammunition depots, industrial storage areas, parking lots, drive in theaters, around billboards, highway and railroad structures. Some of the compounds have utility for selective weed control in crops such as wheat. Alternatively, the subject compounds are useful to modify plant growth. The rates of application for the compounds of the invention are determined by a number of factors, including their use as plant growth modifiers or as herbicides, the crop species involved, the types of weeds to be controlled, weather and climate, formulations selected, mode of application, amount of foliage pre sent, etc. In general terms, the subject compounds should be applied at levels of around 0.001 to 10 kg ha, the lower rates being suggested for use on lighter soils and or those having a low organic matter content, for plant growth modificaton or for situations where only short term persistence is required. The compounds of the invention may be used in combination with any other commercial herbicide examples of which are those of the triazine, triazole, uracil, urea, amide, diphenylether, carbamate and bipyridylium types. The herbicidal properties of the subject compounds were discovered in a number of greenhouse tests. The test procedures and results follow. Seeds of crabgrass
