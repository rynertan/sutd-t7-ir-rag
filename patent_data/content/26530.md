# A centrifugal filter for cleaning lubricating oils, particularly for internal combustion engines.

## Abstract
The filter 1 comprises a rotor or impeller 15 carrying a blade element 21 contained into a space 22 enclosed by a foil grate 23,23 . The oil pressure generated by the oil pump causes the rotation by reaction of the rotor or impeller and of related blade element so that the latter, by centrifugal effect, separates from the oil all the impurities which are retained by the grate. The oil is supplied to the rotor or impeller through passages 5,17,18 upstream of the grate and is exhausted at cleaned condition through passages 11,12,13,4 located downstream of the grate.

## Claims

## Description
A CENTRIFUGAL OIL FILTER PARTICULARLY FOR INTERNAL COF2US TION ENGINESThe present invention relates to a centrifugal filter for cleaning lubricating oils, particularly for internal com bustion engines.In the specific field of internal combustion engines, the cleaning of lubricating oil is provided, as well known, by causing the oil to pass through a cartridge filter, or by a centrifugal filter, the operation of which is derived from the driving shaft.In the case of cartridge filters, the latter require to be periodically replaced, while in the case of centrifugal filters, particular mechanical expedients are required for the actuation of the filter by the driving shaft.The object of the present invention is to provide a centre fugal oil filter replacing the conventional cartridge fil ters without any modification to the engine, and capable of operating without requiring any connection to the dri ving shaft.According to the invention, the centrifugal oil filter es sentially comprises a rotor or impeller rotatably driven by the pressure of the circulating oil, a blade element int tegral with said rotor or impeller,a grate circumferential ly located relative to said blade element for retaining the impurities contained in said oil, passages for supply ing pressure oil to said rotor or impeller, and passages dowstream of said grate for exausting the cleaned oil from said filter.A preferred embodiment of a centrifugal oil filter actor3 ding to the invention is shown by mere way of unrestrictim ve example in the figures of the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 shows the filter as a whole Fig. 2 is a sectional view taken along line Il Il ofFig. 1 and Fig. 3 is a sectional view taken along line Ill Ill of Fig. 2.Referring to the figures, the oil filter generally de signated at 1 comprises an outer circular shell or hou sing 2, for example made of thin plate, having screwed houP sed therein an inner body member 3, for example made of light alloy, on the upper face of which a threaded passage 4 is provided for screwing to a conduit not shown used for recycling of the cleaned oil to the engine, and passage ges 5 circlaferentially arranged about said passage 4 for oil inlet from the engine to filter 1.A gasket 6 assures the sealing effect between said body member 3 and outer shell or housing 2, whereas a gasket 7 assures the sealing effect between said body 3 and a conventional seat provo ded on the cylinder block and at present used for housing the conventional cartridge filters.A cylindrical element 9 is mounted by screwing and with the interposit on of a gasket 8 on said body member 3, the bottom 12 of this cylindrical element having a central pas sage 11. Such is the configuration of said element 9 that, when in position, it defines with the inner wall of shell or housing 2 Ã…a gap or hollow space 12 communicating through radial passages 13 only one of which shown in Fig. 2 with the outlet threaded passage 4.The lower face or underside of said body member 3, inter nally of the cylindrical element 9 and centrally of the latter, has mounted thereon a bushing 14 for free rotate ble support of a rotor or impeller, generally designated at 15. Said rotor or impeller 15 essentially comprises a hollow stem 16, the cavity or bore 17 of which cosmunicas tes through a chamber 18 with the inlet passages 5, while three nozzles 19 branch off from the bottom thereof, the se nozzles being suitably oriented in a single direction.The bottom 20 of said rotor or impeller 15 has thereto se cured a blade element 21 enclosed within a space 22 circum ferentially defined by a grate 23, the latter being inter gral with at least the bottom 10 of said cylindrical ele ment 9.As particularly shown in Fig. 3, said grate 23 comprises a plurality of radial foils 23 , which are spaced apart from one another to give rise to a tab system suitable to receive and retain the impurities separated by centrifu gal effect from the oil.The above mentioned chamber 18 communicates with said gap or hollow space 12 by means of a plurality of small ball valves only one of which is shown in Fig. 2 , each of which comprising a ball 24 reacted by a calibrated spring 25 and each of which contained within a passage 26 provo ded on said body member 3.The filter 1 is completed by a cover or lid 27, making up the bottom of shell 2, which can be removed by removal of screws 28.In operation, when the filter 1 is used on an internal comX bustion engine conventionally provided with a cartridge filter said filter is mounted within the housing of said cartridge filter, and in substitution for the latter, by screwing the outlet passage 4 on the recycle conduit for the cleaned oil. Owing to the calculated dimensions, cor responding to those of a conventional cartoridges the gas ket 7 will sealingly cooperate with a corresponding part of the cylinder block.Due to the pressure delivery of the oil pump, the oil is supplied from the engine cup or pan through the passages 5 to the chamber 18 and exits therefrom through the noz zles 19 and, by reaction effect owing to the suitable oz rientation of said nozzles, causes the rotation of the ro tor or impeller 15 and accordingly of the blade element 21.Thus, the oil stored within the space 22 is centrifuged and the impurities therein contained are propelled into and retaIned by the grate 23. The cleaned oil exits from aperture 11, is supplied to the gap or hollow space 12 and therefrom delivered through the radial passages 13 to the outlet passage 4 and recycled to the engine. The grate 23 can be easily cleaned,without having to remo ve the whole filter 1, by merely moving the bottom 27 away and removal of bottom 10 removably secured to said cylin drical element 9 by so operating, a free access to said grate 23 is gained, which grate can be in case extracted along with said bottom 10.The ball valves 24 26 act as by pass in case of casual shut off of the oil passage through the nozzles 19.It clearly appears that the basic principle of the inven tion, mainly consisting of causing oil centrifugation due to pressure developed by the oil pump, can be adopted for a filter replacing a conventional cartridge, as well as for engines suitable adapted for directly receiving a fil ter according to the invention.
