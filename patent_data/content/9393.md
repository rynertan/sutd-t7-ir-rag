## Description
DESCRIPTION PNEUMATIC FORCE MULTIPLYING DEVICE . This invention relates te a pneumatic force multiplying device such as va√∫un servomotor or the like, which is particularly adapted for use in a hydraulic braking system of a vehicle. Conventional vacuum servomotors comprise a housing defined by a front shell and rear shell, a valve body slideably supported by the rear shell and incorporating therein a valve mechanism, a flexible diaphragm connected to the circumference of the valve body and extending in the radial direct ion toward the circumference of the housing to divide the interior of the housing into a front chamber and a rear chamber, and a piston plate mounted on the valve body and extending contiguous to the diaphragm. WEen a vacuum servomotor of the aforesaid kind is used in a vehicle hydraulic braking system a master cylinder is rigidly secured to the front shell by means of bolts or the like and the rear shell of the servomotor is rigidly connected to a toe board a plate partitioning a driver s compartment from an engine room according to usual practice. In such a case, the housing of the servomotor has to receive the force acting on the master cylinder and when the strength and rigidity of the housing of the servomotor are insufficient, discrepancies have been experienced such that the housing of the booster is deformed, that the effective stroke of the booster and hence the master cylinder is reduced. It is possible to overcome discrepancies aforementioned by increasing the thickness of the shells constituting the housing. However, there are problems such that the weight of the booster will increase and that the amount of the material for fabricating the housing will aiso increase. An object of the present invention is to provide a novel pneumatic force multiplying device solving the problems aforementioned. The invention reside in providing at least one rigid connecting rod which eft.end through the front and rear chambers and the opposite ends of the connecting rod are rigidly connected to respective shells thus preventing unwanted deflections. Preferably, two or more connecting rods are provided each of which are in equally spaced relationship both in the radial and circumferential directions with respect to the longitudinal axis of the device. The connecting rod may slidably and sealingly pass through the diaphragm and pass through the piston plate but, alternatively the connecting rod may slidably and sealingly pass through an opening formed in the valve body. The invention will now be described further hereinbelow by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig.l is a longitudinal sectional view of a pneumatic force multiplying device according to the invention Fig.2 is a perspective view of a C ring utilized in the device of Fig.l Fig.3 is a longitudinal sectional view of a second embodiment of the invention Fig.4 is an enlarged partial view showing a portion of Fig.2 Fig.5 is a view similar to Fig.4 but showing a modified form Big.6 is an enlarged partial view showing a portion of Fig.3 Fig.7 is a view similar to Fig.6 but showing a modified form Fig.8 is a partial view showing a seal member and Fig.9 is a longitudinal sectional view of a third embodiment cf the invention. The pneumatic force muftiplying device illustrated in Fig.l comprises a housing defined by a front shell 2 and a rear shell 3, and a valve body 4 slidably supported by the rear shell 3. The valve body 4 has a flange portion 4a on the front end thereof, and an annular groove b which is spaced rearward from the flange portion 4a by a predetermined distance. A generally dish like shaped piston plate 7 having a central opening is mounted on the valve body 4 with the inner circumferential portion of the opening thereof being clamped between the flange portion 4a and a Cshaped ring 8 Fig.2 which is fitted in the annular groove 4b.A flexible diaphragm 9 is bonded to the rear surface of the piston plate 7 with the inner circumferential portion 9a tightly fitting with the outer circumference of the valve body 4 and the outer circumferential portion 9b being clamped between flange portions 2a and 3a of respective shells 2 and 3. The diaphragm 9 divides the interior of the housing into a front chamber A and a rear chamber B. The valve body 4 incorporates therein a valve mechanism 10 for effecting the force multiplying action of the device. For actuating the valve mechanism 10 there is provided an input rod 11 which is retained in the valve body 4.The rear end of the input rod 11 projects out of the valve body and is adapted to be connected to a brake pedal not shown or the like. An out put rod 12 projects through the end wall of the front shell 2 and is adapted to be connected to a piston or the like of a master cylinder not shown which is connected to the front shell 2 through a spacer 13. The rear end of the output rod 12 is slidably received in a disc holder 15 and receives therefrom the output force of the device through an elastic disc 14. The disc holder 15 is secured to the piston plate 7 by means of a plurality of circumferentially spaced pawls 7a which are formed on the piston plate 7 by cutting and bending operations and engage respectively with the outer circumference of the disc holder 15.The valve body 4, the diaphragm 9, the piston plate 7 and the disc holder 15 constitute an integral sub assembly. According to the invention, there are provided three connecting rods 17 which are spaced symmetrically both in the radial and circumferential directions with respect to the longitudinal axis of the device only one is shown in Fig.1 . Each connecting rod 17 extends through the front shell 2, the piston plate 7, the diaphragm 9 and the rear shell 3. A reduced diameter portion 17a having a screw threaded portion on the outer end thereof is formed on each end of the connecting rods 17 and an outwardly facing shoulder l b is defined at the step in the diameter between the reduced diameter portion and the main body portion of the connecting rod 17. The reduced diameter portion 17a extends, on the front end of each of the connecting rods 17, through an opening formed in the front shell 2 and through the spacer 13.A nut 18 engages with the screw threaded portion of the connecting rod 17 thereby securing the spacer 13 to the front shell 2. In the embodiments the master cylinder not shown is fixedly supported on the spacer 13. On the rear end of each connecting rod 17, the reduced diameter 17a extends through an opening formed in the rear shell 3 and through an opening formed in a toeboard not shown of a vehicle, and engages with a nut not shown , thus, the rear shell 3 is rigidly connected to the toe board, whereby the pneumatic force multiplying device and the master cylinder are rigidly mounted on a chassis or stress bearing member of the vehicle. The connecting rod 17 extends through respective openings formed in the piston plate 7 and the diaphragm 9 which partition tha chambers A and B. A lip seal 9c is integrally formed on the diaphragm 9 to sealingly and slidably engage with the connecting rod 17. On the front end of the connecting rod 17 t here is provided an annular seal member 21 to seal from the atmosphere the chamber A which is a vacuum chamber as shown in the embodiment. On the rear end of the connecting rod there is provided a washer 19 welded on the inner wall of the rear shell 3 to tightly engage with the shoulder 17b of the connecting rod to seal the chamber B. If desired, a suitable gasket or the like may be provided between the shoulder 17b and the washer 19. In operation, the input rod 11 moves forward in response to the depression of a brake pedal not shown , the valve mechanism 10 is actuated to, firstly, disconnect the communication between the chambers A andB and, secondly, connect the chamber B with the atmosphere. Thus, a differential pressure is generated across the piston plate 7 and the diaphragm 9, and the piston plate 7, the diaphragm 9, the valve body 4 and the disc holder 15 integrally move forward whereby a multiplied force is transmitted through the output rod 12 to the master cylinder. The reaction of the force in the output rod 12 is transmitted to the input rod 11 through the elastic disc 14. The reaction of the force generated in the master cylinder is transmitted through the connecting rods 17 to the chassis member of the vehicle and not through the front and rear shells 2 and 3. The embodiment shown in Figs. 3 and 4 is generally similar to the first embodiment and corresponding numerals have been applied to corresponding parts. The connecting rods 17 are integrally connected to the front shell 2 as shown in Fig.4. Specifically, the shoulder 17b on the forward end of each of the connecting rods 17 is tightly pressed against the inner wall of a portion 2b surrounding the opening of the front shell 2 by forming a projection 17c under a caulking process or the like. Alternatively, the caulking process may be substituted by a nut 20 engaging with the connecting rod 17 as shown in Fig.5.The connecting rods 17 of the embodiment of Fig.3 further act to tightly connect the front and rear shell 2 and 3, so that the outer circumferential portion 9b of the diaphragm 9 is simply clamped between the end portions 2a and 3a of the front and rear shells 2 and 3. Thus, it is possible to omit conventional connecting ring such as shown in Fig.l thereby reducing the outer diameter of the device. Since the connecting rods 17 are integrally connected to the front shell 2, the assembling operation of the booster including the assembling operation of the shells can be performed very easily. Alternatively, the connecting rods are integrally secured to the rear shell 3 and releasably connected to the front shell 2. Fig.6 shows the detailed construction of the lip portion 9c of the diaphragm 9 in the embodiments ofFigs. 1 and 3. An annular lip portion 9c integrally formed on the diaphragm 9 slidably and sealingly engages with the connecting rod 17. A bore 7b is formed in the piston plate 7 for freely passing therethrough the connecting rod 17. The diaphragm 9 further has a sleeve like portion 9d extending through the bore 7b and tightly engaging with the inner circumference of the bore tE, and a flange like portion 9e extending radially outward from the sleeve like portion 9d for engaging the surface portion of the piston plate surrounding the bore 7b The sleeve like portion 9d and the flange like portion 9e constitute a retaining portion for retaining the lip portion 9c in its proper position with respect to the piston plate 7 thus assuring the sealing characteristics of the lip portion 9c. Fig. 7 shows a modified form, in which the flangelike portion 9e of the diaphragm 9 is nodified to define an annular recess 9f for receiving therein an annular resilient ring 22, whereby the retaining portion of the diaphragm 9 is reliably retained on the piston plate 7, thus the relative position of the lip portion 9c and the piston plate 7 can reliably be maintained. In the embodiments of Figs. 6 and 7, the flangelike portion 9e of the diaphragm may not necessarily have an annular configuration. Fig.8 shows the details of the seal member 21 in the embodiment of Fig.l. As shown in Fig.8, a recessed portion 2c is formed in the end wall of the front shell 2, and the seal member 21 received in the recessed portion 2c has an axial length larger than the depth of the recessed portion 2c. Thus, when the reduced diameter portion 17a of the connecting rod 17 is inserted through the front shell 2, the seal member 21 and the spacer 13, and when the nut 18 is tightly applied, the front shell 2 and the spacer 13 are tightly connected and the seal member 21 assures that the chamber A is effectively sealed. Fig.9 shows another embodiment wherein the connecting rods only one is shown in the drawing extend through the valve body, but the general construction is similar to the embodiments of Figs. 1 and 3, thus, corresponding numerals have been applied to corresponding parts. In the embodiment, the flange portion 4a of the valve body 4 has an increased diameter and a plurality of openings 4e are formed therethrough to receive the connecting rods 17. The piston plate 7 and the diaphragm 9 are secured to the outer circumference of the flange portion 4a. A seal member 23 and an annular retainer 24 are mounted on the valve body 4 to slidably seal the clearance between each of the openings 4e and the connecting rod 17 passing therethrough. In the embodiment of Fig.9, the disc holder 15 in the embodiments of Figs. 1 and 3 is omitted and the rear end of the output rod .2 is received in a bore formed in the forward end of the valve body 4. As described heretofore in detail, the pneumatic force multiplying device according to the invention comprises a rigid connecting rod extending through the front and rear shells with the opposite ends thereof being connected to respective shells, thus it is possible to prevent the deformation of the shells thereby maintaining the desired characteristics during long period of usage. Further, since the force acting on the shells can substantially be reduced, the shells may be formed of a material the thickness of which being thinner than that of conventional shells and, further, the shells can be formed of a synthetic resin or the like, thus the fabricating cost of the booster can further be reduced. Further, the front and rear shells are connected by the connecting rods, thus, it is possible to omit t he connecting means, such as the connecting ring shown in Fig.l or the like, and the assembly operation can be performed easily.
