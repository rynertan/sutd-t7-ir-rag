## Description
Photo electrostatic method for glaze decorating ceramic tiles, machine therefor, and end product obtained therefromThe invention relates to a photo electrostatic method and machineryfor applying decorative glaze to ceramic tiles, and to the end product turned out by adoption of such a method that is, a new method, partly inspired by the Xerox photocopy principle, which will enable printing of a decorative glaze onto ceramictiles by utilising the appropriate machinery. Thus, the method itself, e machine, and the end product obtained, constitute the collective subject which the application seeks to protect with letters patent.The prior art in this field consists of a variety of tile glaze decorating methods and relative devices which provide for projection of the glaze medium in liquid state through stencils onto the surface requiring decoration said projection being brought about either centrifugally by disc, or by free fall, or by spray gunning, or with a system of revolving delivery receptacles, or by silkscreen process this with either a flat screen, or a set of screens fitted to a revolving drumg Al such techniques are characterised by the use of glaze in liquid state1 Systems whereby glaze is applied to tiles by projection in the liquid state require amongst other thins a long production line per colour, which signifies capadous factory premises and a great deal of ancillary equipment to cover each single type of tile, not to mention all the necessary dust vacuuming, cleaning and wash down plant. In the case of silkscreen ing, a screeassembly per single colour is necessary, as well as one operative for each such assembly, andtime in which to set up the screens themselves and keep a constant check on the glaze compound for correct consistency1 Whatever the individual system employed, the liquid glaze medium requires preparation, and cannot always by utilised to the last dropx Finally, production methods involving the application of glaze in liquid state give rise to a large reject percentage.The prior art thus outlined standes in need of improvement considerable improvement especially with regard to the undesirability of applying glaze in liquid state, and by the same token, of overlarge plant used therefor, of vacuum and other cleaning installations, and wash down facilities, and of uneconomical man power requirements such improvement bringing with it an end product characterised by better finishing and enhanced definition1From the foregoing, one may discern the need for a solution to the technical problem of discovering a glaze decoration method capable of applying the medium in its dry state, and a machine for carrying said method into effect a machine such as will rationalise the production of glazed ceramic tiles by reducing space requirements, man power, wasted material, operating time and costs, and rejectsThe invention described herein solves said problem through the adoption of a decorating method which is to some extent inspired by xeroprinting, the application of xerography to photocopy reproduction developed by the Xerox company TheXerox method makeS provision for buiId up of a positive charge in a selenium coated conductor to some 6000 volts tis by inducing a coronas phenomenon in order to render it light sensitive1 Light reflicted by the white areas of tile image to be reproduced will then hit the selenium correspondingly, so as to allow selective earthing out of the positive charge, leaving behind a positively charged area which will correspond to the image s dark parts1 Being thus positively charged, the conductor image is then capable of attracting a special black powder which is negatively charged and consists of a carrier medium graphite, usually and a thermoplastic resin pigment, this being strewn onto the blank copy paper and fixed by heat teatment, so as to obtain a permanent reproduction1 The method to which the invention relates, wherein, in accordance with the Xerox principle, a cylindrical conductor having a selenium covering is charged to 6000V by the corona phenomenon, replaces the special black powder aforesaid with a normal glaze compound in dry state and having a negative charge the image to be transferred onto the tile being provided by a transparency caused to reciprocate horizontally through a longitudinal path above said cylindrical conductor, whilst projection of the image onto the cylinder top side is brought about by lamp and optic fibres movement of the transparency being synchronised with that of the tile which travels horizontally beneath the cylinder and opposed thereto, reproduction of the image onto the cylinder during the transparency s return travel being precluded by application of light from an auxiliary source the cylinder being caused to rotate and transfer said image downwards towards a first convergence produced by a feed cylinder from which the negatively charged dry glaze medium is imparted to the image transfer cylinder and caused to adhere to the positively charged dark areas of the latter there being a second restriction located in opposition to the optic fibres and at the bottom side of said image transfer cylinder where the tile itself, positively charged by conductors position beneath, passes beneath in order to receive the glaze therefrom said glaze adhering to ie tile surface by virtue both of the agency of a lamp which causes earthing out of the positive charge, and of prior dampening of the tile surface followed by application of a neutral base coat incorporating a bonding agent.

Provision is made for a screw adjusted stretcher 122 acting on belt 118 at a point between pulleys 119 and 120, whilst a further stretcher 123 tensioned by means of a spring is located between pulleys 120 and 117 by working stretcher 122 back or forth at the turn of its screw, pulley 120 can be made to advance or retard with respect to pulley 119 so as to synchronise movement of the transparency 113 with that of the detent 102 offered by chain 101, this bringing about the correct timing between tile 2 and transparency 113. 124 denotes a pulley keyed to the shaft of the uppermost agitator rod of the two denoted 60 prismatic so as to transmit drive to the lower agitator rod 60, the cylindrical agitator rod 61, and the shaft 63 of feed cylinder 62 this by way of a belt 125 looped around semes Funtion of the machine, in the case of the embodiment as illustrated in figs 1 6, is as follows having started the gearmotor 81 and supplied electrical power to those parts of the machine requiring same in all stages of the line e1g. three such units as described hereiin the case of a glaze decoration involv ing three distinct colours and mounted the three transparencies intoiheir respective sliding carriages 12, tiles may be fed onto the belt 3 çpropria tely spaced apart, already moistended and given their neutral glaze base coat1 The leader tile now triggers electromagnet 40, which engages the trailing top end 36 of the timing block 7 with the tooth 6 offered by belt 3 already propelling tile 2 toward idD the machine ifus tooth 6 carries block 7 forward, and occasions movement of the carri age 12 and transparency 13 in the opposite direction by way of cable 41 23. As the transparency passes little by little beneath the beam emitted by lamp 15, the obtic fibres 42 below project the image line by line onto the top side of transfer cylinder 46, whose outer surface 48 is already invested with a uniform positive electric charge produced by the coronet phenomenon generated by filament 49. The clear areas of the transparency allow passage to the light which, as a result, cancel out the corresponding positively charged areas on 48 of the cylinder passing beneath.Thus,the positively charged area, or pattern remaining on surface 48 will correspond to the tansparency s dark parts, whilst the boundary of the transparency either matches, or is proportioned to, that of the tile 2 itself Crosspiece 32 forming part of the timing block 7 now comes up against the recess 35 offered by longitudinal 25 and, thanks to the incline 34 iicorporated thereinto, top end 36 is freed from tooth 6 of the carrier belt 3, and the carriage 12 and timing block 7 make their respective returns to originai position, at the same time triggering electromagnet 57 whose excitation permits light emission from lamp 51 so as to render the transparency 13 without influence during its return1 With the formed image now round at the meeting point of the two cylinders 62 and 46 48 clearance at point S narrowing to some few tents of a millimetre a dusting of negative y charged glaze is carried into the narrowed area by the feedcylinder 62 itself this by virtue of the fact that strips 65 aforementioned are positively charged by sectorial conductor denoted 66, and thus attract the negatively charged dry glaze particles.Passing from thence into the negatively charged sector denoted 67, strips 65 reverse polarity so as to throw the powdered glaze toward area S and onto the facing surface offered by image transfer cylinder 46 48, still retaining the pattern received from the t nsparency 13. The dry glaze adheres to the dark parts of surface 48, being positively charged, though not to those areas already discharged, A remnant will return toward the hopper held by the positively charged areas of feed cylinder 62, whilst the particles 59 held by positive charge on surface 48 continue toward ts second narrowed area, S , where a tile will be moving forward, in receipt of a positive charge from the conductors 71 beneath1 At this point, glaze 59 adhering to the dark areas of cylinder surface 48 are attracted by the positively charged tile, to whose surface they immediately take , according to the image imparted, since the light emitted by lamp 72 earths out the positive charge carried by surface 48, and in addition, the base coat already applied to the tile itself incorporates a bonding agent, as mentioned at the outset, Once the final colour has been thus copied onto the tile, a fix provided by frits or a transparent glaze compound will wovide the protective final coat1 Referring now to figs 7 11, funcion comes about thus havig started up the motorvariator 99 and supplied electrical power to all parts of the machines making up the line e1g1 three such units as described herein, in the case of a glaze decoration involving three distinct colours and mounted the transparencies 111 into their three respective glass cylinders 107, the tiles 2, already moistened and given their neutral glaze base coat, can be fed onto the pair of carrier cog blets 91.The tiles will in fact be appropriately spaced apart by stop 105 via triggering of a microswitch timed with the detent 102 offered by chain 101, such that the detent travelling at a lesser speed than that of the belts 91 themselves is enabled to position the single tiles correctly with respect to said glass cylinder 107 transparency 111 mounted within the latter being synchronised with said stop 105 so as to pass over the slot 115 in baffle 114, the result 6 which is that the beam emitted from lamp 113 passes through the optic fibres 42 so as to project the image line by line onto surface 48 of the transfer cylinder 46, this retaining a formed image which will correspond to the transparency s dark area1 Once the border of the transparency passes over slot 115, any further image therefrom will be cancelled out automatically from cylinder 46 48 by light emitted from lamp 51 which projects through the aperture 53 at that point opened up by excitation of electromagnet 57, this operated by a cam timed by glass cylinder 107 itself1 The actual image transfer stages are similar in all respects to that described in the case of the embodiment in figs 1 6. Synchronous movement of cylinders 107 and 46 48 with tile 2 is obtained by the transmission system which associates chain 101, glasscylinder 107 and image transfer cylinder 46 48 by way of a single drive belt 118 looped around the self same motor variator output shaft 99 turning belts 91. Pulley diameters are such that the speed travelled by belts 91 matches the surface speeds of both cylinders 107 and 46 48 also, the speed travelled by chain 101. hence of detent 102 is less than that of belts 91, thus permitting correct alignment ae the single tile 2 with respect to the image revolving on cyli nder 48. Fine adjustment of the tile position thus obtained, giving perfect alignment both with the image on surface 48 and with the transparency 111 itself, is then had by working the screw operated stretcher 122, so as to advance or retard pulley 120 that driving chain 101 with respect to the two cylinders which bring about image transfer glass cylinder 107, and transfer cylinder 46 48. When carrying the invention into effect, materials, dimensions, constructional and design details such as the shape of hopper 58, the method of bringing about traverse of carriage 12 and timing block 7 substituting pulley drive for sheath 24, for instance , may all differ from those disclosed, whilst remaining equivalent in terms of the art, and by no means straying from within the bounds of protection afforded to the invention by claims as appended, With this in mind, the microswitch which operates stop 105 might well be cam controlled from the end 108 of glass cylinder 107, or from the shaft 47 of image transfer cylinder 46 48, or from the chain s 101 drive sprocket 103, or even from the detent 102 offered by said chain, or, indeed, from any other moving part of the machine whose operation is sychronised with said cylinders 107 and 46 48.
