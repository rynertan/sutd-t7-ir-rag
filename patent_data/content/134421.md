# BONDING METHOD FOR PRODUCING VERY THIN BOND LINES

## Abstract
A bonding method which uses two solutions, one being anionic and the other being cationic, to lay down alternating layers of particles of accurate dimension onto members which are to be bonded. Thereafter, the layers are placed in contact, and the members are bonded together by diffusion bonding techniques.
