# Hot melt adhesive system.

## Abstract
A hot melt foam adhesive system including a gear pump 10 wherein gas is mixed under pressure into the molten adhesive and is driven into solution with the adhesive. The adhesive gas solution is supplied at a relatively high press ure to a valved dispenser 26 or gun from whence it is dispensed onto a substrate. As the adhesive gas solution emerges from the dispenser 26 , the gas comes out of solution but remains entrapped in the adhesive, thereby forming an adhesive foam. The system includes a recycle flow line or hose 26a for returning adhesive gas solution from the dispenser 26 to the pump 10 . Within this recycle flow line 26a there is a pressure regulator 28 responsive to flow changes or viscosity changes of the adhesive gas solution for maintaining a fixed back pressure in the system, thereby enabling the system to maintain a fixed and uniform flow rate from the dispenser 26 during all operating conditions of the dispenser 26 .
