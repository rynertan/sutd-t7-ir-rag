# Byte to bit synchronizing circuitry.

## Abstract
The circuitry synchronizes byte boundaries in a serial bit stream from a communications processor 10 with a byte timing signal BYTE from a device 26, the signal BYTE being in synchronism with bit timing pulses CLK but not byte boundaries. The bit stream starts with two all 1 s bytes and an all 0 s byte. The number of 1 s in the second all 1 s pulse following the BYTE signal is counted by a counter 200 the data bit stream is fed into a shift register 202 and the appropriate output is selected by a multiplexer 204 control led by the stored count in counter 200, to achieve synchroni zation. The unit 10 may be coupled to several devices 20, 22, 26 having differently timed BYTE signals, with the count from the counter in the active adapter 12, 14, 20 being fed to unit 10 to identify the active one of the devices.
