# Bis crown ether derivatives and their use.

## Abstract
Bis crown ether derivatives having such configuration that the two crown rings may easily overlap spatially, holding a potassium or the like ion between them, and ion selective membranes used for said bis crown ether derivatives as neutral carrier, which are useful as an ion sensor and are superior to the ion selective membrane containing valinomycin.
