# FIBER REINFORCED MOULDABLE SHEET AND PROCESS FOR PREPARATION THEREOF

## Abstract
A carbon fiber reinforced mouldable sheet is pro vided. The mouldable sheet comprises a thermoplastics resin and at least two reinforcing agents differing in the length diameter ratio, which are incorporated with the thermoplastics resin. One reinforcing agent A contained in the composite sheet is a carbon fiber hav ing a length diameter ratio of 200 to 30,000 and the other reinforcing agent B is a fibrous and or powdery reinforcer having a length diameter ratio of less than 50, and the contents of the reinforcers A and B in the mouldable sheet are 5 to 30 by volume and at least 5 by volume, respectively, the sum of the con tents of the reinforcing agents A and B being in the range of from 20 to 50 by volume. The reinforcing effect of the carbon reinforcing fiber A is enhanced by the fibrous and or powdery reinforcing agent B filled among spaces of reinforcing fibers A . Therefore, mouldable articles made therefrom are excellent in mechanical properties, appearance and light weight characteristic.
