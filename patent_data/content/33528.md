# Fluid flow control device for use with an evacuated blood collection container.

## Abstract
A fluid flow control device 10 for use with an evacuated blood collection container 12 comprises a substantially rigid body 14 . Two needle cannulae 19,22 are connected to the body 14 with a space 15 therebetween. A resilient collaps ible passage 35 member lies in the space and connects the two cannulae 19,22 in fluid communication with each other. The passage member 35 contacts the body 14 only at its ends with its central portion positioned to remain free of contact with the body 14 during use. This passage member is accessible to finger grip from at least two different direc tions to allow an operator of the device to apply pressure with the fingers to control fluid flow through the passage member. Another embodiment of the present invention substan tially as described above includes an operable collapsing element connected to the body for collapsing the passage member 44 during use to control fluid flow therethrough.
