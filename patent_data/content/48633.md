# PURIFICATION OF PROTEIN EXTRACTED FROM LEAVES

## Abstract
Fraction I protein ribulose 1,5 biphosphate carboxylase oxygenase extracted from plant leaves is purified by crystallisation from a mixed solution having a pH of 6.6 to 7.0 formed by mixing a solution of the extracted protein with a precipitant solution of a pH which is higher than that of the latter solution and is in the range 4.8 to 7.2, preferably 5.0 to 6.0. For certain leaf species, such as potato and tobacco, the protein solution preferably includes a salt, such as NaCl, capable of increasing the solubility of the protein in water, to avoid precipitation of fraction I protein before conditions are appropriate for crystallisation.
