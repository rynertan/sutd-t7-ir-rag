# Automatic slack adjuster.

## Abstract
A single acting, clearance sensing slack adjuster for brakes is provided. The slack adjuster includes a displaceable brake actuation means 28 , a rotatable driving membre 52 , a rotatable intermediate member 60 and a rotatable driven member 56 . The driven member is in driving relationship with a rotatable ad justement member 50 which is rotatable in a given direction to advance a brake friction member 32 to maintain the running clearance 38 within predeter mined limits. Means 76 80 are provided to rotate the driving member in the slack decreasing direction of rotation in response to greater than predetermined mo vement 82 of the brake actuation means A first coil clutch 20 couples the driving and intermediate mem bers while a second coil cluth 72 couples the in termediate and driven members. One clutch 72 deli vers torque in the given direction in its low torque trans mitting capacity direction of rotation and that torque capacity is less than is required to rotate the rotatable actuation members when the brake friction members are engaged.
