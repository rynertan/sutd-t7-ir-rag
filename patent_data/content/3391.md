## Description
APPARATUS FOR BENDING AflD TEMPERING GLASS TECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to apparatus for bending and tempering sheet glass. BACKGROUND ART Bent and tempered glass is used extensively for vehicle side and rear windows to provide good resistance to breakage as well as an aesthetically appealing shape that complements the design of the vehicle.In order to perform the bending and tempering, sheet glass must be heated to its deformation point of about 12000 to 13000 F and then bent to the required shape before being rapidly cooled by an air spray in order to temper the glass Tempering greatly increases the mechanical strength of the glass and its resistance to breakage as well as causing the glass to break into small relatively dull pieces when broken instead of into large sharp slivers as is the case with untempered glass. One manner in which glass is bent and tempered is with press benders having shaped surfaces between which heated glass is clamped to shape it prior to being air cooled by a quench unit to provide tempering.United States Patents 3,454,389 3,476,52 3,488,178 3,600,150 and 3,951,634 disclose press bending and tempering apparatus for sheet glass. Sheet glass is also bent and tempered by heating of planar glass sheets while supported on bending molds including movable sections. Prior to softening of the glass during heating, the sections of the mold are oriented to accommodate for the glass sheet planarity.Upon softening of the glass sheet as it is heated, the mold sections move relative to each other under the force of gravity acting on the sheet and the mold sections in order to provide bending of the sheet prior to rapid cooling thereof which provides its tempering. Thin glass, i.e. on the order of 1 8 , cannot be bent by this apparatus since it does not have sufficient weight to actuate the pivoting of the mold sections until the glass becomes so soft that it overbends. UnitedStates Patents 3,269,822 3,278,287 3,307,930 and 3,365,285 disclose this type of bending and tempering apparatus. Heating of glass sheets prior to bending and tempering thereof has also been performed on fluid support beds as the glass is conveyed through a furnace.Normally the support bed is inclined slightly with respect to the horizontal so that gravity engages an edge of the glass with a movable frame that provides the impetus for glass movement along the bed. There is no contact between the bed and the oppositely facing surfaces of the glass during the conveyance as the glass is heated. This lack of contact prevents marring and scratching of the soft surfaces of the glass as the glass reaches its deformation temperature. However, there normally is mechanical contact with the glass during the bending after the heating in preparation for a cooling quench that tempers the glass in its bent condition.United States Patents 3,497,340 3,607,187 and 3,60720G disclose glass bending and tempering apparatus of this type with a fluid support bed. Vacuum forming of heated glass sheets is disclosed by United States Patent 3,778,244 wherein the sheet glass is first heated during conveyance along a roller hearth conveyor. After heating, a lifter with a curved downwardly facing surface has a vacuum applied thereto about the surface to shape the glass. After shaping against the curved surface of the lifter, the vacuum is terminated to drop the glass onto a mold for conveyance to a waiting operator who removes the glass from the mould. Further vacuum forming of the glass to a curved surface of the mold is also disclosed. Other bending and tempering apparatus for sheet glass is disclosed by United States Patents 2,223,124 2,348,887 2,646,647 and 2,085,520. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide improved apparatus capable of bending and tempering thin sheet glass, i.e. on the order of 1 8 thick, at relatively high production rates while providing accurate control of the shape to which the glass is bent. In carrying out the above object, apparatus of the invention includes a furnace with a housing that defines a heating chamber in which glass is heated during conveyance along a roller hearth conveyor. An upwardly opening lower housing portion and a fixed roof of the furnace housing cooperate with vertically movable side doors to define the heating chamber. Lower ends of the doors cooperate with the upper ends of side walls on the lower housing portion to define side slots through which ends of elongated conveyor rolls project outwardly from the heating chamber. Heat seals at the slots limit the loss of heat froze the heating chamber to the environment.Continuous drive loops in the form of either chains or solid steel belts support the ends of the conveyor rolls and are slidably driven over external support surfaces extending alongside the slots to support and frictionally drive the rolls. Upward movement of the side doors perrits access to the furnace heating chamber for maintenance and repair. A vacuum holder of the apparatus is positioned within the heating chamber above the conveyor rolls and in one embodiment has a downwardly facing planar surface with restricted openings spaced thereover. A vacuum is drawn within the restricted openings to receive the heated sheet of glass from the conveyor and support the glass above the conveyor in preparation for bending. A greater vacuum is drawn to initially support the glass, while a lesser vacuum is subsequently drawn so as to support the glass without deforming it at the openings in the holder surface. Marring of the glass against the surface is prevented by providing it with a porous cover made of ceramic fibers. The porous cover also distributes the vacuum between the holder openings.Auxiliary lifters positioned between the conveyor rolls are movable upwardly to lift the sheet of glass toward the vacuum holder so as to aid in picking it up off the conveyor. Vertical movement of the vacuum holder is also provided for the same purpose,downward movement of the holder locating its planar surface in proximity to a heated sheet of glass to be picked up, and upward movement of the holder liftIng the glass upwardly in a spaced relationship to the conveyor rolls. Sensing of the glass positio along the conveyor and operation of a lateral locator accurately position the glass on the holder surface without requiring t e conveyor to be stopped prior to the holder operation. One locator disclosed operates during the conveyance upstream from the holder and includes one sensor upstream from the locator and another sensor between the locator and the holder for sensin the longitudinal position of the glass. Both sensors are coupled to the conveyor drive mechanism and the vacuum holder to coordinate their operation. Another lateral locater disclosed operates after the glass has been lifted by the auxiliary lifters but before it has been initially supported on the holder. A single sensor upstream from this locator is coupled with the conveyor drive mechanism and the auxiliary lifters as well as the vacuum holder to coordinate their operation. After the sheet of glass is supported on the vacuum holder, a carrier mold preferably in the form of a ring is moved under the glass. Termination of the vacuum then drops the sheet of glass onto the mold ring so that the glass sags within the furnace heating chamber under the bias of gravity from its planar condition to a curved shape of the ring.Maintaining the carrier ring within the heating chamber of the furnace for a predetermined period of time, on the order of one to ten seconds, allows the glass to be bent to the required shape. Only the mold ring has to be changed to bend different size glass to different shapes due to the planarity of the hclder surface.Such is not the case with press benders whose curved surfaces can only bend glass to a single curvature. It is also possible for the center of the holder surface to be slightly raised relative to its perimeter, on the order of 1 4 for a 4 foot surface1 to reversely bend the glass prior to the gravity bending so as to prevent overbending on the mold ring. To make deep bends, another embodiment of the holder has a curved surface against which the auxiliary lifters form the glass. Further bending by gravity subsequently takes place on the mold ring. A quench unit of the apparatus is positioned adjacent an end of the furnace housing in which the vacuum holder is received. Movement of the mold ring with the bent glass thereon into the quench unit between upper and lower blastheads thereof provides tempering of the glass. Air flow through nozzles of the blastheads cools the heated glass rapidly as the tempering takes place to increase its resistance to breakage. One embodiment disclosed includes a damper which, after completion of the tempering, diverts air flow from the upper blasthead to the lower blasthead so that the glass sheet is picked up off the mold ring.The mold ring then moves back to the furnace and the air is diverted back to the upper blasthead to drop the glass onto a delivery conveyor. Glass movement on the delivery conveyor from between the blastheads delivers the glass fram the quench unit to an operator. In another embodiment disclosed, the mold ring carries the glass from the heating chamber to the quench unit for tempering and then to the operator who removes the glass. Subsequently, the mold ring is driven back through the quench unit to the heating chamber ready to begin another cycle The auxiliary lifters preferably are T shaped, each including an upper crossbar and a stem that projects downwardly from the crossbar between the conveyor rolls. This T shaped lifter construction is strong and operable even when the rolls are closely spaced. Each lifter crossbar includes a woven ceramic cloth cover that engages a heated sheet of glass as the lifter moves upwardly to pick the glass off the conveyor rolls. The objects, features, and advantages of the present invention are readily apparent from the following description of the best mode for carrying out the invention taken in connection with the accompanying drawings.

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION Referring to FIGURES 1 and 2 of the drawings, one embodiment of the glass bending and tempering apparatus constructed according to the present invention is indicated generally by 20 and includes a furnace 22 as well as a quench unit 24. One end 26 of the furnace 22 receives discrete sheets of glass to be bent and tempered while the other end 28 of the furnace has provisions for bending the glass once it is heated in a manner that is hereinafter described. Quench unit 24 is shown by solid line representation positioned laterally adjacent one side of the furnace end 28 and receives the heated and bent glass to provide tendering thereof in a manner that is likewise hereinafter described.It is also possible for the quench unit 24 to be positioned at the other side of the furnace end 28 or at its longitudinal end as shown by phantom line representation. Quench units can also be provided at any t or all three of these positions to receive heated and bent qlass for temperinq and thereby increase the system output. The quench unit 24 aliqned with the longitudinal direction of the furnace can also be used to temper sheet glass that is not bent With reference to rIGURD 8b, the furnace 22 in which shee glass is heated includes a housing composed of lower and upper portions 30 and 32, respectively. Lower housing portion 30 is made from refractory blocks 34 mounted on a ramework of horizontal and vertical beams 36 defining an upwardly opening U shape. A bottom wall 38 of the lower housing portion 30 is made from a larger refractory block and includes T shaped retainers 40 for securing heater elements 42 Side walls 44 o the lower housing portion 30 are defined by the refractory blocks 34 extending upwardly from the bottom wall 38 to support upper refractory end blocks 46, Upper housing portion 32 includes a fixed roof 47 and a pair of vertically movable side doors 48 that extend downwardly from the roof in a U shape to cooperate with the upwardly opening U shape of the lower housing portion in defining a heating chamber 50. Fixed roof 47 also has T shaped retainers 40 and heater elements 42 secured thereby like the bottom wall 38 of the lower housing portion.A horizontal beam 52 is supported at its opposite ends by vertical beams 54 only one shown in FIGURE 8a and itself supports horizontal beams 56 that mount nut and bolt connectors 57 for securing the roof 47. A pulley system collectively indicated by 58 counterbalances the weight of each door 48 during movement thereof between its lower closed position shown by solid line representation and its upper open position shown by phantom line representation. Pulley system 58 includes a counterweight 60 FIGURE 82 associated with each side door 48 as well as a nur,ber of pulleys 62 over which cables 64 are trained so that the counterweight moves up and down with the door upon manual effort applied to the door independently of the other door.In the open positions of the side doors, the heating chamber 50 is accessible for maintenance and repair.In the lower closed positions, the side doors prevent the escape of heat from the heating chamber 50. A conveyor of the apparatus is indicated collectively by reference nv .eral 66 in FIGURE 8b and includes a plurality of conveyor rolls 68 see alsoFIGURE 9 of fused silica particles that are sinter bonded to each other. Ends of each conveyor roll 68 project outwardly through sice slots 70 defined between the upper end blocks 46 of the lower housing portion and the lower ends 72 of the vertically movable side doors 48. Heat seals 73 on the blocks 46 and lower door ends 72 seal the slots 70 to prevent the loss of heat from the furnace to the environment and cooperatively define circular openings not shown through which the roll ends project.Continuous drive loops 74 in the form of chains or solid steel belts are slidably driven over upwardly facing support surfaces of members 76 that extend alongside the side slots 70 as best seen in FIGURE 9. Each roll end is positioned between upwardly extending projections 78 which have idler rollers 80 FIGURE 8b for preventing movement of the rolls along with the drive loops. Nut and bolt supports 82 mount the support surface members 76 on the horizontal beams 36 in a vertically adjustable manner to maintain planarity of the upper sides of all of the rolls 68. Each end of the horizontal beams 36 mounting the support surface members 76 rotatably mounts a pulley 84 FIGURE 9 over which the associated drive loops 74 are trained.At one end of the conveyor, a cross shaft 85 FIGURE 12 connects the pulleys 84 and a drive mechanisn 86 drives these pulleys by a digital drive motor such as the electric stepper motor 88 which drives a chain 90 to pull the drive loops 74 over the support surfaces and thereby frictionally drive the adjacent roll ends. United States Patents 3,806,312 3,934,970 3,947,242 and 3,994,711 disclose this type of frictional roll drive mechanism and the entire disclosure thereof is hereby incorporated by reference. As seen in FIGURES 3, 7, and 8b, a vacuum holder 92 of the apparatus is positioned within the furnace heating chamber 50 at the end of the furnace adjacent the quench unit 24 and has a downwardly facing planar surface 94. Vacuum holder 92 is seen in FIGURE 8b as including an upper portion 96 of a do mwardl,z opening U shape and a lower portion 98 of a relatively thick plate like construction with edge projections 100 received within associated grooves in the upper portion 96 so as to be secure thereto and cooperate therewith in defining a cavity 102. A sheet like cover 104 made of ceramic fibers, preferably silica, is compressed in a mat that has a porous construction. Such a silica fiber mat is commercially available and, as such, no further description thereof will be given.Any suitable high temperature adhesive is used to secure cover 104 on the downwardly facing planar surface 94 of the lower holder portion 98. Aligned openings or holes 106 and 108 through the holder portion 98 and the cover 104 communicate with the cavity 102. A vacuum drawn within the cavity 102 through a duct 110 by a vacuum blower 112 FIGURE 3 is thereby drawn in the holes 106 and 108 in order to support a heated sheet of glass on the holder above the conveyor rolls 68 shown in FIGURE 8b. Cover 104 prevents marring or scratching of the soft glass surface as the glass shft is engaged vith the holder and, due to its porous cons unction, distributes the vacuum between the holes. As the glass sheet is conveyed under the vacuum holder 92, a control or damper 114 of duct 110 is located in its solid line indicated position of FIGURE 3 by an actuator embodied as a cylinder 116. One end of cylinder 116 is pivotally fixed by a pin 118 to a stationary support while a piston rod 119 of the cylinder is secured by a pin 120 to the damper 114.No vacuum reaches the lower holder surface 94 with the damper in this position so that the glass is free to move under the holder. Once the glass is positioned under the holder, the cylinder 116 is supplied pressurized fluid to retract its rod 119 and to move the damper to its position shown by phantom line,represen tation and indicated at 114 . An opening 121 to the environmental atmosphere through duct 110 is open with the damper in its solid line 114 position and closed by the damper in its phantom line position 114 . Vacuum is supplied to the lower holder surface 94 to pick up the sheet of glass with the damper in position 114 . Once the heated glass has been picked up by the vacuum holder, the cylinder 116 is supplied pressurized fluid to extend its connecting rod 119 and position the damper in the partially open position with respect to duct opening 121 as shown by phantom line representation and indicated by 114 . Only a partial vacuum is drawn in the holder by the blower 112 with the damper in this partially opened position as a result of the atmospheric pressure that can enter the holder openings through the duct opening 121. This reduction in the drain vacuum prevents the heated glass which is softened from being deformed in a dimple like manner at the restricted holes or openings 108 that are spaced over the holder surface 94 as best seen in FIGURE 7.The vacuum which is drawn in the partially opened damper position 114 shown in FIGURE 3 is about 10 in inches of mercury of the vacuum which is drawn with the damper in its position indicated by 114 where the duct opening is closed. When the vacuum holder 92 is ready to release the lifted sheet of glass, as is hereinafter described, the cylinder 116 is supplied pressurized fluid to extend its piston rod 119 in order to locate the damper 114 in its solid line indicated position so that the vacuum draam at the lower holder surface 94 is terminated in order to let the glass drop under the force of gravity. Two modes of operation are provided for facilitating the vacuum holder pickup of sheet glass from the conveyor. As seen in FIGURE 8b, vacuum holder 92 is supported below the housing roof 47 by vertical rods 122 whose lower ends are threaded to receive nuts 123. Holes 124 in the roof 47 receive intermediate portions of the rods 122 to allow vertical movement thereof and upper ends of the rods are interconnected by a bar 126 and secured to cables 128 of a support or pulley system 130.Brackets 132 rotatably support pulleys 134 of this system on the horizontal beam 52 shown in both FIGURES 8a and 8b and the cables 128 are trained over these pulleys. As seen in FIGURE 8a, a common plate 136 of a cylinder actuator 138 is connected to the cables 128. Actuator 138 includes a cylinder 140 mounted on the vertical beam 54 and having a piston connecting rod 142 connected to the plate 136 by a pin 144.Guide 146 is mounted by a bracket on the vertical beam 54 and guides the rod 142 during upward and downward extending movement by the cylinder 5140 upon being supplied a suitable pressurized flid Upward movement of the rod 142 allows the cables 128 to lower the holder 92 shown in FIGURE 8b toward the conveyor rolls 68 in order to facilitate pickup of the glass by a vacuum supplied in the manner previously discussed. After the pickup, the vacuum holder 92 is raised by downward movement of the rod 142 shown inFIGURE 8a so as to move the supported sheet of glass on the holder upwardly away rom the conveyor. Auxiliary lifters 148 shown in FIGURE 11 are positioned between the conveyor rolls 68 and provide another mode of operation for facilitating the vacuum sheet glass pickup by the holder 92. Auxiliary lifters 148 have T shaped cross sections and extend parallel to the conveyor rolls 68 and transversely with respect to the direction of sheet glass conveyance within the furnace. Opposite ends of the lifters 148 extend outwardly through the furnace housing side slots and are supported by elongated bars 150 at the sides of the furnace, these bars being notched to receive the lower ends of the lifters. A pair of cylinders 152 mounted on the vertical beams 36 as shown in FIGURE 8b have connecting rods 154 with upper ends connected to the bar 150 by pins 155 seen by reference back to FIGURE 11. Pressurized fluid is supplied to cylinders 152 in order to extend their rods 154 and raise the associated bar 150 as well as the auxiliary lifters 148 from the solid line indicated position of FIGURE 11 to its phantom line indicated position in order to lift the heated sheet of glass upwardly toward the vacuum holder 92. This upward movement of the glass positions it in proximity to the lower surface 94 of the vacuum holder so as to facilitate the glass pickup. After the vacuum holder is supporting the glass, cylinders 152 are supplied pressurized fluid to retract their piston connecting rods 154 so as to lower the auxiliary lifters 148 back between the conveyor rolls 68. Rather than using a pair of cylinders for moving each bar 150, it is possible to use a single cylinder and interconnected linkages operated by the cylinder. Such a single cylinder linkage support of the auxiliary lifter bars 150 ensures coordinated movement of the bars. As seen by combined reference to FIGURES 8a, 8b, and 10, spaced rails 156 of the quench unit 24 mount a pair of carriers 158 and 160 for movement perpendicular to the direction of glass conveyance within the furnace. Carrier 158 includes crossing straps 162 FIGURE 10 on which a mold in the form of a carrier ring 164 hereinafter more fully described is supported for movement between the furnace 22 and the quench unit 24. Carrier 160 likewise includes crossing streps 166 on which a delivery ring 168 is supported for movement between the quench unit and an operator who stands adjacent the apparatus at the leXt hand side of FIGURE 8a. Carrier 158 extends into the furnace heating chamber in a cantilevered manner upon movement to the right to position ring 164 below the vacuum holder 92.In this position, the carrier extends through the housing side slot 70 at the adjacent side of the furnace. Movement of the carrier 158 to the left pulls the ring 164 out of the furnace through this side slot 70 and moves it into the quench unit 24. During use, carrier 158 shown in FIGURE 10 moves the mold ring 164 beneath the vacuum holder 92 with a heated sheet of glass supported on its lower planar surface 94. Vacuum supplied to the holder 92 is then terminated so that the heated glass drops down onto the mold ring 164 within the furnace heating chamber 50. A helical spring 170, see FIGURES 4 6, is wrapped about ring 164 in a helical shape and engages the periphery of the glass with point contact so as to minimize any cooling effect that the ring will have on the glass. Due to its heated condition, the planar sheet of glass begins to sag under the bias of gravity so as to assume the curved shape of the ring as seen inFIGURE 5.Carrier 158 continues to position the mold ring 164 within the heating chamber for a momentary dwell period so that the glass sags a sufficient extent without oversagging, this period of time depending upon the particular configuration to which the glass is to be bent. After this dwell within the furnace, normally for one to ten seconds, the carrier 158 moves from the furnace heating chamber 50 shown in FIGURE 8b to the quench unit 24 shown in FIGURE 8a and positions the bent sheet of glass between lower and upper blastheads 172 and 174 of the quench unit. Each of these blastheads is preferably of the type disclosed inUnited States Patent 3,936,291, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. A blower 176 shown in FIGURES 3 and 9 supplies a duct 178 with air that acts as a cooling fluid.Branch ducts 180 and 182 from duct 178 respectively feed the lower and upper blastheads 172 and 174 so that the air is sprayed from the blastheads through nozzles thereof onto the opposite surfaces of the bent glass carried by the mold ring 164. This air supply rapidly cools the glass surfaces to temper the glass and thereby increases its mechanical strength as well as causing the glass to break into small dull pieces.Carrier 158 preferably oscillates back and forth between the blastheads to uniformly distribute the impingement of cooling air with the glass. A control in the form of a cylinder 184 is then supplied pressurized fluid to extend its piston connecting rod 186 and to move the damper 188 of duct 182 from the solid line position to the phantom line position shown inFIGURE 3. This damper movement closes the branch 182 to the air flow from the bloWer 176 and diverts the air supply from the upper blasthead 172 through the duct 180.Air thus supplied through the lower blasthead 172 impinges with the lower surface of the bent and tempered glass sheet and lifts this glass sheet upwardly off of the mold ring 164 into suspended engagement with suitable bumpers 190 FIGURE 9 on upper blasthead 174 so that the mold ring carrier 158 shown in FIGURE 10 can move toward the right back into the furnace ready to pick up another piece of glass for another cycle. Subsequently, the carrier 160 also zones te the right to position its delivery ring 168 below t suspended sheet of glass engaged with the upper blasthead. When the delivery rir.g 163 shown in FIGURE 10 is positioned below the upper blasthead 17 against which the bent and tempered sheet of glass is suspended, the cylinder 184 of FIGURE 3 is supplied a pressurized fluid to retract its rod 136 and pivot the damper 188 fro its phantom line closed position to its solid line open. position. Air from the blower 175 is then again supplied to the upper blasthead 174 as well as to the lower blasthead 172 so that the lifted sheet of glass drops down onto the delivery ring. Prior to the next sheet of glass being moved from the furnace to the quench unit by the carrier 158 shown in FiGURE 10, the carrier 160 moves the delivery ring to the left side of the apparatus as viewed in FIGURE Sa where a waiting operator can pick the glass off of the ring. Delivery ring 168 thus functions as a delivery conveyor for the tempered glass,Suitable after cooling blastheads may follow the quench blastheads and thereafter cool the glass to room temperature before conveyance to the operator. As seen in FIGURE 10, actuators for moving the carriers 158 and 160 are embodied as continuous drive chains 192 and 194, respectively. Drive chains 192 are located at the opposite sides of the quench unit and secured by connectors 196 to the carrier 158. Chain sprockets 198 and 200 have the chains 192 trained over them with the sprockets 198 interconnected by a hollow cross shaft sleeve 202 that couples the chains 192 for operation with each other. Likewise, chains 194 are secured to the carrier 160 by connectors 204 and are trained over sprockets 206 and 208 which are respectively aligned with the sprockets 198 and 200. A cross shaft 209 extends through sleeve 202 and interconnects the sprockets 206 with each other.Drive chains 210 and 211 shown in FIGURE 10 drive respective sprockets 212 and 213 from digital drives such as the electric stepper motors 214 and 215 in order to move the carriers 158 and 160 by the actuator chains 192 and 194 independently of each o her.Stepper motor 214 provides rapid movement of the carrier 160 on which the mold ring 164 is thereby moved from the furnace into the quench unit without significant heat loss. Accurate control of the acceleration and deceleration involved is also possible with the stepper motor drive of the carrier ring to prevent the glass from being marred by sliding on the ring as it starts and stops. The manner in which the vacuum holder picks up the heated glass from the conveyor and maintains the glass planar prior to dropping the glass onto the mold ring for bending under gravity gives great production flexibility for bending and tempering glass of different sizes and shapes. Any size and shape of glass can be bent and tempered on the apparatus without changing the vacuum holder due to the planar shape of its surface 94. Only the shape and size of the mold ring 164 FIGURES 4 6 must be charged in order to accommodate for bending and tempering of different size and shape glass sheets.Also, locating the quench unit 24 laterally with respect to the direction of glass conveyance through the furnace 22 from its end 26 to end 28 see the solid line position of the quench unit in FIGURE 2 allows the glass to also pass straight out the furnace end 28 through a door opening 216 FIGURE 9 where a quench unit for tempering planar sheet glass can be located. As previously mentioned, another quench unit can also be located on the opposite side of the furnace end 28 shown in FIGURE 2 from the quench unit 24 so that glass sheets can be received from the furnace and transferred to the quench units on both sides of the furnace for tempering after first being bent in order to increase production output. Planar surface 94 of the vacuum holder may have its center slightly raised with respect to its periphery, i.e about one quarter of an inch higher on a surface of a 4 foot dimension so that the surface is not completely planar although it is generally planar. Such a slightly concave downward but generally planar surface reversely bends the glass prior to the bending on the ring to prevent overbending under the force of gravity With reference to FIGURE 12, a control panel 216 of the glass bending and tempering apparatus 20 is coupled to a lateral locator 218 by electrical or hydraulic lines 220 and 220a.and b. Locator 218 includes a pair of cylinders 222a and 222b which have associated piston connecting rods 224a and 224b that extend into the housing of furnace 22 through the side slots from which the conveycr rolls 68 project outwardly to be driven by the continuous drive loops 74.As the sheets of glass G ate conveyed from the right to the left over the conveyor rolls, a first photoelectric sensor 225 coupled to panel 216 by a line 225 senses the glass to thereby actuate locator cylinders 222a and b so as to extend their piston connecting rods 224a and b. Engagement of the rods with the sheets of glass G properly locates the glass at the correct lateral location on the rolls with respect to the vacuum holder in the proper angular orientation. Any improper angularity or lateral positioning of the sheets of glass G on the rolls is thus corrected by this locator 218. A second photoelectric sensor 226 positioned within the furnace 22 and coupled to control panel 216 by a line 228 senses the leading edge of the located glass sheet G as it is conveyed toward the left past the locator 218.It will be noted that the glass sheetsG are triangular in shape as shown, being designed as control vent windows for vehicles. Two sensors are necessary since the location of the leading glass edge can change as the glass slides along the rolls during operation of the locator 218. The exact position of the sheet glass with respect to the vacuum holder 92 is known at all times since the electric motor 88 of drive mechanism 86 is coupled by a line 230 to a counter 231 of the control panel 216 as is the sensor 226 by line 228. Control lines 232 and 234 connect the vacuumholder cylinder actuator 140 and the auxiliary lifter cylinder actuators 152, respectively, to the control panel 216 and counter 231 thereof so that operation of these components is coupled with the sensing of the glass position by counting each motor revolution.Glass can thus be picked up off of the conveyor without first stopping its movement while always properly locating the glass longitudinally along the direction of conveyance with respect to the mold ring 164 that has a corresponding triangular shape with a required curvature for bending of the glass. The chain actuators 192 and 194 for moving the mold and delivery rings 164 and 168 are also coupled by lines 236 and 238 to the control panel 216 in order to coordinate the movement of the sheet glass to the quench unit 24 from the furnace 22 and from the quench unit to the operator. FIGURE 13 is a schematic view similar to a portion of FIGURE 12 of another embodiment of the apparatus. Mold ring 164 is moved by its stepper motor driven chain actuator 192 from the furnace end 28 to and through the quench unit 24 in this embodiment. There is no transfer of the glass to another delivery ring by diverting air flow to the lower blasthead from the upper blasthead as with the previous embodiment of FIGURES 1 12. After removal of the glass from ring 164 by the operator, the ring is driven back to the furnace ready to begin another cycle. With both embodiments of the apparatus, the mold ring 164 is preferably reciprocated by its carrier drive within the quench unit 24 to distribute the flow of air sprayed onto the glass. This distribution provides uniformity to the tempering of the glass. A modified version of the apparatus is shown in FIGURE 14 and indicated by 20 . Except as will be noted, many of the components of this modified apparatus are the same as the previously described apparatus and as such bear like reference numerals.Hoever, the locator 218 is located adjacent the vacuum holder 92 rather than upstream from the single sensor 226. The longitudinal position of the sheet of glass G is sensed by sensor 226 to control operation of the vacuum holder 92. After cylinders 152 raise the bars 150 and the auxiliary lifters 148, the sheet of glass G supported on the auxiliary lifters is engaged by extension of the rods 224a and b of the locator cylinders 22a and b and slid along the auxiliary lifters to the proper angular orientation and lateral position.Vacuum subsequently supplied to the holder 92 in the same manner previously described then engages the sheet of glass with its downwardly facing lower surface so that the auxiliary lifters can subseuently be lowered prior to the mold ring moving under the vacuum holder.Control panel 216 and its counter 231 coupled to the electric motor 88, the vacuum holder cylinders 140 and 152, the locator 218, and the sensor 226 provide sequenced operation of the apparatus. Auxiliary lifters 148 each have the T shape shown in FIGURE 15 and include an upper crossbar 236 and a lower stem 238 that projects downwardly from the crossbar. This T shape provides a rigid auxiliary lifter than can be positioned between the conveyor rolls 68, even when the rolls are closely spaced, and nevertheless function as required. Crossbar 236 can have a width greater than the spacing between the rolls 68 and still be located below the upper sides of the rolls in the lower position so that the glass G can be conveyed on the rolls prior to being picked up as shown by the phantom line indicated position. A cover 240 of woven ceramic cloth, i.e. fiber glass cloth, over the upper side of the crossbar 236 is secured by clips 242 and engages the glass G as it is picked up and slid along the auxiliary lifter by the locator 218 previously described in connection withFIGURE 14.Two L shaped steel members 244 are secured to each other in a suitable manner such as by welding or rivets to provide the T shape of the lifter 148.Of course, it is also possible to utilize a unitary member of a T shape to provide the auxiliary lifter.Likewise, it is possible for the cover 240 to have a tubular shape through which the auxiliary lifter stems rather than providing the securement clips 242. With reference to FIGURES 16 and 17, a modified embodiment 92 of the vacuum holder is shown as having a downwardly facing surface 94 which is of a curved shape. A heated sheet of glass is conveyed under the vacuum holder 92 by the conveyor 66 and then lifted upwardly by the auxiliary lifters 148 which move from the solid line position of FIGURE 16 to the phantom line position thereof to engage the sheet of glass G as shown against the curved surface 94 . Ends of the auxiliary lifters 148 are supported by a suitable poweroperated actuator which is capable cf lifting auxiliary lifters at the left and right extre s a greater distance than the ones in the center to conform the sheet of glass with the downwardly convexed shape of the curved surface on the vacuum holder.A vacuum drawn within the holder 92 then supports the sheet of glass against the surface 94 and the auxiliary lifters 148 are moved downwardly. Carrier 158 then moves the mold ring 164 beneath the holder 92 and the vacuum being drawn is terminated so that the sheet of glass G drops onto the mold ring. It will be noted that the mold ring 164 has a greater curvature than the vacuum holder surface 94 . Further bending of the sheet of glass G thus takes place on the mold ring 164 under the bias of gravity. Carrier 158 then moves the mold ring 164 from below the vacuum holder 92l out of the furnace heating chamber and into the quench unit in the same manner previously described. Relatively deep bends can be made by the prebending on the holder surface and the subsequent gravity bending on the ring as described in connection with FIGURES 16 and 17.
