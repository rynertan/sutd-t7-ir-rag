# SHEAR SEAL ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
A shear seal assembly 65 has an inner sleeve 66 and an outer sleeve 68 with an elastomeric material bonded there between. One sleeve 68 has a circumferential groove 74 formed in the exposed wall 76 thereof in which groove 74 an O ring 78 nests. The assenbly is mounted between two telescoping members 28,38 that have limited relative rota tion. The sleeve without the groove 74 is press fit on or in one member 38 and the sleeve 68 with the groove 74 will be spaced from the other member 28 so that the O ring 78 will extend from the groove 74 into sealing contact with said other member 28 . Clips or retainers 82 are provided for seating the grooved sleeve 68 to said other member 28 whereby limited reiative rotation or oscillation between the members takes place without rupturing the elastomeric mat erial. The shear seal can be removed without destroying the shear seal structure so that it can be reused.
