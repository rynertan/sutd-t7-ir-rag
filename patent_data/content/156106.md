# PRETREATMENT OF PLASTIC MATERIALS FOR METAL PLATING

## Abstract
This invention relates to a process for conditioning the surfaces of natural and synthetic plastic materials for electro less plating of a metal coating thereon by exposing such materials to an atmosphere comprising ozone, contacting said exposed materials with a conditioning solvent, such as an aqueous solution of sodium, potassium or lithium hydrox ide, and thereafter rinsing said contacted materials with an aqueous solution of one or more surfactants.
