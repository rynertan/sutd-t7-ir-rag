# Receptor based histamine assay.

## Abstract
A receptor based clinical or research competitive inhibi tion assay method for determining histamine in body or labora tory fluids is disclosed. A kit for carrying out the method is also described comprising an amount of histamine receptors suffi cient to provide an excess of receptors for bindung with the amount of histamine in the sample to be assayed, and an amount of a histamine indicator conjugate sufficient to react with the resulting unbound histamine receptors present after reaction of the histamine sample with the histamine receptors.
