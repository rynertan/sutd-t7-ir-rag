## Description
This invention relates to a phenoxyalkane derivative and processes for preparing same. More particularly, it relates to a phenoxyalkane derivative of the formula EMI1.1 wherein R1 is methoxy, n is zero, A is alkylene of 2 to 4 carbon atoms and Y is a group of the formula EMI1.2 orEMI1.3 wherein X is hydrogen or halogen orR1 is hydrogen or methoxy, n is an integer of 1, A is alkylene of 2 to 3 carbon atoms and Y is a group of the formula EMI1.4 orR1 is methoxy, n is zero, Y is a group of the formula EMI1.5 and A is a branched alkylene of the formula EMI1.6 wherein either one of R2, R3 and R is methyl and the remaining two groups of R2 R3 and R4 are hydrogen, or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof. Cerebral edema, which is a well known complication of various cerebral diseases e.g., cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, cerebral thrombosis, cerebral embolism, head injury, cerebral tumor and encephalomyelitis , induces an increase in intracranial pressure due to compression of neighbouring brain tissues. Moreover, such increased intracranial pressure is known to adversely affect cerebral metabolism, result in disturbances of cerebral circulation and further aggravate cerebral edema. Therefore, increased intracranial pressure exerts serious damaging effects on patients or is sometimes fatal to them. As a result of various investigations, we have now found that the phenoxyalkane derivative I of the present invention shows a significant decrease in intracranial pressure. For example, when a solution of a test compound in an aqueous 5 w v mannitol solution was infused via the femoral vein of rats at a rate of 0.2 ml kg minute for 20 minutes, 1 4 acetamidobenzyloxy 3 4 phenylpiperaz ino n propane dose 1 mg kg showed about 23 decrease in the intracranial pressure 40 minutes after administration of the test compound. In view of the effect of the phenoxyalkane derivative I on intracranial pressure, said compound of the present invention is useful for treating a warm blooded animal, including human, suffering from increased intracranial pressure due to various cerebral diseases such as cerebral infarction, cerebral thrombosis, cerebral embolism, cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, head injury, cerebral tumor, cerebral edema, encephalomyelitis and the like. Moreover, since the phenoxyalkane derivative I of the present invention shows a potent depressing effect of central nervous system, said compound is also useful as a tranquilizer, an analgesic or an anti vommitting agent. Examples of the phenoxyalkane derivative include those of the formula I in which R1 is methoxy, n is zero,A is alkylene such as ethylene, trimethylene or tetramethylene,Y is a group of the formula EMI3.1 and X is hydrogen or halogen such as chlorine or R1 is hydrogen or methoxy, n is an integer of 1, A is alkylene such as ethylene or trimethylene, and Y is a group of the formula EMI3.2 or R1 is methoxy, n is zero, A is branched alkylene such as a group of the formula CH2CH CH3 CH2 , CH CH3 CH2CH2or CH2CH2CH CH3 , and Y is a group of the formula EMI3.3 Among them, a preferred subgenus includes the compound of the formula I in which R1 is methoxy, n is zero, A is trimethylene and Y is a group of the formula EMI3.4 or R1 is hydrogen or methoxy, n is an integer of 1, A is, trimethylene and Y is a group of the formula EMI3.5 or R1 is methoxy, n is zero, A is a group of the formula CH2CH CH3 CH2 or CH2CH2CH CH3 , and Y is a group of the formula EMI4.1 Further preferred subgenus includes the compound of the formula I in which R is hydrogen or methoxy, n is an integer of 1, A is trimethylene and Y is a group of the formula EMI4.2 or R is methoxy, n is zero, A is a group of the formula CH2CH CH3 CH2 , and Y is a group of the formula EMI4.3 The compound I of the present invention can be used for pharmaceutical use either as the free base or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof.pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compound I include, for example, inorganic acid addition salts e.g., hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulfate, nitrate, phosphate and organic acid addition salts e.g., acetate, lactate, oxalate, citrate, tartrate, fumdrate, maleate, methanesulfonate, benzoate . The compound I of the present invention can be administered either orally or parenterally. A daily dose of the compound I maybe about 0 05 to 50 mg in terms of free base , especially 0.1 to 10 mg in terms of free base , per kilogram of body weight. Further, the compound I may be used in the form of a pharmaceutical preparation containing the same compound in conjunction or admixture with a pharmaceutical excipient suitable for enteral or parenteral administration.Suitable excipients include, for example, gelatin, lactose, glucose, sodium chloride, starch, magnesium stearate, talcum, vegetable oil and other known excipients. The pharmaceutical preparation may be in solid form such as powder, tablets or capsules or in liquid form such as solutions, suspensions or emulsions.The compound I may also be used in the form of an injection for drip infusion. According to the present invention, the compound I in which is methoxy, n is zero, A is alkylene of 2 to 4 carbon atoms and Y is a group of the formula EMI5.1 orEMI5.2 X is the same as defined above or R1 is hydrogen or methoxy, n is an integer of 1, A is alkylene of 2 to 3 carbon atoms and Y is a group of the formula EMI5.3 can be prepared by condensing a compound of the formula EMI5.4 wherein Z is a reactive group or atom and R1, A and n are the same as defined above, with a compound of the formula EMI5.5 wherein Y is the same as defined above.On the other hand, the compound I in which R1 is methoxy, n is zero, Y is a group of the formula EMI5.6 and A is a branched alkylene of the formula EMI5.7 R2, R3 and R4 are the same as defined above can be prepared by condensing a compound of the formula EMI6.1 wherein R1 and n are the same as defined above, with a compound of the formula EMI6.2 wherein either one of R2 , R3 and R41 is methyl and the remaining two groups of R211 R31 and R41 are hydrogen, Z is a reactive group or atom and Y is the same as defined above.

It is preferred to carry out the reaction at a temperature of 200 to 1000C. The condensation reaction of the compound IV and V is accomplished in the presence of an acid acceptor in a solvent Alkanol e.g., methanol, ethanol, propanol , dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide and the like are suitable as the solvent. Examples of the acid acceptor include inorganic bases such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide and the like. It is preferred to carry out the reaction at a temperature of 20 to 1000C. It is also preferred to carry it out in an inert gas e.g., nitrogen gas atmosphere. In carrying out this condensation reaction, a compound of the formula EMI7.1 wherein R1, n and Y are the same as defined above, is obtained by the use of a compound of the formula EMI7.2 V wherein Z and Y are the same as defined above as the starting compound.On the other hand, the condensation reactioniof the compound IV with, for example, a compound of the formula EMI7.3 V gives the compounds of the formulae EMI7.4 wherein R1, n and Y are the same as defined above. This may be probably due to a fact that the compound V used as the satrting compound reacts with the compound IV via a spiro compound of the formula EMI8.1 wherein Y is the same as defined above. These two compounds I and I thus obtained may be readily separated from one to another in a conventional manner, for example, by fractional recrystallization thereof.
