# Thermal imaging apparatus.

## Abstract
The narcissus effect in thermal imaging apparatus employing scanned arrays of cooled infra red radiation detectors 5 is produced, in part, by the detectors seeing themselves by reflection in the surfaces of optical elements 4, 6, 7 during the middle part of the scan, resulting in a darkened centre in the displayed picture 12, 19. To compensate for this effect, a signal 43 is formed of the sum of the detector outputs and applied in negative feedback 40 to each detector output. Extended bright or dark areas are suppressed but picture detail special to individual detectors is largely unaffected.
