# Conveyor.

## Abstract
A conveyor is provided with a carriage 3 moving back and forth between two end positions. At the end positions there are vertically moving support means 7, 8 to fix the object 42 to be conveyed in a starting position and in an end position, respectively. The carriage 3 and the support means 7, 8 are driven by a common motor 9 , the synchronization between the movements of the carriage and the support means being such that the carriage interrupts its movement while the support means carry out their movement.
