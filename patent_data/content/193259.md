## Description
This invention is concerned with the use of genetic engineering techniques in the modification of plants. The invention provides chimeric genes, plasmid vectors, plants, plant seeds, plant tissue, cell cultures and plasmids arising in and from the use of such genetic engineering techniques in the modification of plants, and methods and compositions for controlling or combating insects in agriculture or horticulture. The invention is particularly directed towards introduction and integration of a chimeric gene coding for a polypeptide toxin produced by Recombinant DNA technology is currently used to genetically engineer certain microorganisms such as bacteria and yeast to synthesize specific proteins. Genetic engineering of higher organisms within the present state of technology requires that one or a few cells be genetically engineered from which the entire organisms can develop. Among higher organisms, the cells of certain plants exhibit excellent regeneration capability and therefore are considered potentially good material for the genetic engineering of such plants. Furthermore, in higher plants, a known system is available to introduce foreign DNA into the plant genome. This system is provided by the tumor inducing plasmid from the gram negative soil bacterium Another major advance in the development of plant engineering technique is the use of plant regulatory sequences to express chimeric genes in plants. In general, these chimeric genes contain a promoter region derived from a gene which is naturally expressed in plant cells, the sequence to be expressed, and preferentially a 3 non translated region containing a polyadenylation site of a gene which is naturally expressed in plant cells. For example, using the nopaline synthase promoter and bacterial antibiotic resistance genes, dominant selectable markers for plant cells have been constructed. Although certain chimeric genes have now successfully been expressed in transformed plant cells, such expression is by no means straightforward. Various lines of evidence indicate that the level of expression of the foreign genes of non plant origin not only varies greatly in different transformed tissues but are in general very low. Such low levels of gene expression could be due to several reasons first, incomplete transcription of the gene resulting from inadvertent transcription termination signals second, inefficient processing of the messenger RNA third, impaired transport of the messenger RNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm fourth, instability of the cytoplasm messenger RNA fifth, inefficient translation of the cytoplasm messenger RNA and sixth, instability of the protein due to its susceptibility to plant specific proteins. Consequently, the successful transformation of plant cells using vectors such as those described above is not necessarily predictable prior to attempting a desired transformation. Engineering of differentiated plant cells and their progeny to express the Bt2 polypeptide and or a truncated version thereof and or a polypeptide having substantial sequence homology thereto is far more difficult than other genes such as antibiotic resistance genes or other plant genes such as thaumatin due to one or more of the following 1 the large size of the Bt2 toxin, even in its truncated form 2 the particular properties of the Bt2 polypeptide such as, but not limited to, solubility of the polypeptide 3 the potential toxicity of the Bt2 polypeptide toward the plant cells or 4 the Bt2 polypeptide synthesized in plant cells and their progeny must retain substantially the same properties as the crystal protein synthesized in bacteria. The toxic activity of the crystal polypeptide produced by Preparations containing the crystals are used commercially as a biological insecticide. For example Bactospeine, distributed by Biochem Products Ltd., Dipel Abbott Laboratories and Thuricide, Sandoz AG. The efficacy of preparations obtained from bacterial hosts is, however, limited as adequate control of pests requires repeated and precisely timed applications. In addition, costs associated with the production of such preparations have made it difficult for them to compete effectively with other commercially available products, such as pyrethroid derivatives. Molecular genetics studies have demonstrated that at least some polypeptide toxins produced by EP A 0 142 924 discloses the transformation of plants with full length Bt genes encoding toxic crystal polypeptides. Considering the major importance of plants both for consumption and for production of valuable products, it would be highly desirable to genetically modify plants such that plant cells could synthesize polypeptide toxins substantially similar to those toxins produced by It is one object of this invention to provide novel chimeric genes coding for the polypeptide toxin produced by Another object of present invention is to provide novel hybrid plasmid vectors containing said chimeric genes that allow the introduction and integration and expression of said chimeric genes in a plant cell genome. A further object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing genetically transformed plant cells comprising the transformation of plant cells with said hybrid plasmid vectors containing said chimeric genes. Other objectives, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. In accordance with the present invention, there are provided chimeric genes capable of being expressed in differentiated plant cells comprising Said chimeric genes include those where DNA fragment b codes for a Bt2 protein, an insecticidally active truncated Bt2 protein, a DNA fragment having substantial sequence homology to Bt2 or the truncated Bt2, or where DNA fragment b is fused to a DNA fragment c coding for an enzyme capable of being expressed in differentiated plant cells and permitting identification of plant cells expressing DNA fragment b where said DNA fragments b and c encode a fusion polypeptide. Also in accordance with the present invention there are provided hybrid plasmid vectors comprising Said chimeric genes include those where DNA fragment b codes for a Bt2 protein, an insecticidally active truncated Bt2 protein, a DNA fragment having substantial sequence homology to Bt2 or the truncated Bt2, or where DNA fragment b is fused to a DNA fragment c coding for an enzyme capable of being expressed in differentiated plant cells and permitting identification of plant cells expressing DNA fragment b where said DNA fragments b and c express a fusion polypeptide. Further, in accordance with the present invention, there are provided intermediate plasmid vectors containing at least one chimeric gene, said chimeric gene comprising Said chimeric genes include those where DNA fragment b codes for a Bt2 protein, an insecticidally active truncated Bt2 protein, a DNA fragment having substantial sequence homology to Bt2 or the truncated Bt2, or where DNA fragment b is fused to a DNA fragment c coding for an enzyme capable of being expressed in differentiated plant cells and permitting identification of plant cells expressing DNA fragment b where said DNA fragments b and c express a fusion polypeptide. Further, in accordance with the present invention, there are provided insecticidal compositions and methods of using transformed plant cells and their progeny. Still further in accordance with the present invention are provided a transformed plant cell containing a chimeric gene which is stably integrated in the genome of the cell, is capable of being expressed in differentiated cells of a plant derived from the cell, and comprises Transformed plant cells and their progeny intracellularly express a polypeptide toxin substantially similar to the polypeptide toxins produced by In the latter 3 sequences, only those amino acids are represented that differ from those present in the Bt2 sequence at the homologous position. Eventually, gaps were introduced marked by in order to align the sequences. B BamHI, Hp HpaI, H HindIII, E EcoRI, Bg BglII. The HindIII fragment present in pGV700 was subcloned into pGV600 Leemans et al., Numbers 1 to 14 are transformed calli. The optical density O.D. corresponding to a level of 4 ng Bt2 protein per gram of tissue, determined in a reconstruction experiment, is indicated in the figure. Numbers 1 to 21 are transformed calli. The O.D. value corresponding to a level of 4 ng Bt2 protein per gram of tissue, determined in a reconstruction experiment, is indicated in the figure. As used herein, the term polypeptide should be understood as meaning an intact protein or fragment s thereof. Plant should be understood as referring to a multicellular differentiated organism capable of photosynthesis including angiosperms monocots and dicots and gymnosperms. Plant cells should be understood as referring to one or more cells derived from a plant. Plant cell progeny should be understood as referring to any cell or tissue derived from plant cells including callus plant parts such as stems, roots, fruits, leaves or flowers plants plant seed pollen and plant embryos. Chimeric gene should be understood as a hybrid DNA segment comprising a regulatory signal essential for transcription referred to as a promotor, fused to at least one structural gene sequence coding for a specific polypeptide. Substantial sequence homology should be understood as referring to either a DNA fragment having a nucleotide sequence sufficiently similar to another DNA fragment to produce a protein having similar properties or a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence sufficiently similar to another polypeptide to exhibit similar properties. Identification should be understood as referring to selection or scoring of cells harboring and expressing the desired gene. Selectable markers permit growth selection under otherwise lethal conditions such as kanamycin resistance Km A chimeric gene may also include a nontranslated DNA fragment positioned on the 3 side downstream of the structural gene sequence, which in turn may include a regulatory signal referred to as a polyadenylation signal preferably derived from a gene which is naturally expressed in plants. A naturally expressed gene includes a 3 non translated region which in turn includes a polyadenylation signal, both of which code for the corresponding messenger RNA mRNA regions. These corresponding mRNA regions are located on the 3 side of a stop codon in a monocistronic mRNA. The 3 non translated region of mRNA is believed to be involved in the processing, stability and or transport of the mRNA. This 3 non translated region of mRNA is also believed to contain a sequence of bases, polyadenylation signal, which is recognized by an enzyme in the cell. This enzyme adds a substantial number of adenosine residues to the mRNA molecule to form a poly A tail on the mRNA. Generally, the process used to arrive at the present invention is described in European Patent Application Publication No. 0116718 entitled Process for the Introduction of Expressible Genes into Plant Cell Genomes and It is contemplated that cloning vectors and bacterial host strains other than those described below in the Examples can be used. Ti based vectors like pGV3850 into which recombinant plasmids integrate before transfer to plant cells are known as cis type vectors. There are also Ti based vector systems in which the recombinant plasmids do not integrate into the resident Ti plasmid or in which large portions of the naturally occurring Ti plasmid are deleted. These binary type systems, Hoekema et al., Further, plasmid vectors containing plant regulatory sequences other than those described below in the Examples can be used. For example, enhancers can be included before, or after, or in such proximity to the chimeric gene to exert their function. Plant cells transformed with the novel plasmid vectors of the present invention may then be cultured on suitable medium, preferably selectable growth medium, and plants which express the polypeptide toxin may be regenerated from the resulting callus. Subsequent generations of plant cells and their progeny should also exhibit expression of the polypeptide toxin. Transformed plant cells and their progeny should express a polypeptide toxin substantially similar to polypeptide toxins being produced by The present invention contemplates that the hybrid plasmid transformation vectors may be used to develop plant cells and their progeny exhibiting insect resistant properties. It is contemplated that plants, particularly dicotyledonous plants, other than those described below in the examples can be transformed such as cotton, sugarbeet, soybean, rape and vegetables such as cabbage, lettuce and beans. Transformed plant cells and their progeny are protected against certain insect pests by expressing an insect controlling amount of polypeptide toxin. By controlling amount is meant a toxic lethal or combative sublethal amount of polypeptide toxin. In general in this description the words controlling and combating are used inter changeably and no distinction is intended except where, from the context, it is clear that a differentiation between a lethal and non lethal dose is intended to be drawn. The transformed plants should be morphologically normal and may be cultivated in their usual manner for consumption and or production of products. Further, said transformed plants should substantially reduce the need for chemical or biological insecticides directed toward combatting Lepidoptera and Coleoptera larvae. Since the genes coding for the polypeptide toxin are stably integrated in the plant cell genome and are thus heritable, seed obtained from said transformed plants should also produce plants expressing the polypeptide toxin at substantially the same level and thereby also be protected against certain insect pests. In addition, it is contemplated that transformed plant cells and their progeny could be used to control certain insect pests by applying to the pests and or the habitat of said pests i.e., the locus to be protected, for example, to a growing crop or to an area where a crop is to be grown an effective controlling amount of transformed plant matter alone or together with other components. By way of example, but not limitation, transformed plant cells and their progeny could be used alone or as one component in a formulation or composition. For practical applications, plant cells and their progeny could be used as the active material or as a solid carrier in conventional pesticide compositions and formulations. Such compositions and formulations may also contain adjuvants such as surfactants and stabilizers. Examples of such composition and formulations include pastes, dusting powders, wettable powders, granules, baits and aerosol compositions. Compositions and formulations are prepared in a known manner. The amount of transformed plant matter to be used depends on a variety of factors, for example, the kind of pest, the formulation or composition used, the state of the crop infected with the pest and the prevailing weather conditions. In general, transformed plant cells and their progeny may constitute from about 0.1 to about 100 by weight of the composition or formulation and preferably from about 1.0 to about 99 by weight. Known insecticidal, fungicidal, biocidal, herbicidal and fertilizer compounds and compositions compatible with the polypeptide toxins may be included as components in the above described compositions and formulations to provide additional benefits and advantages. In practice, certain Lepidoptera or Coleoptera larvae attempt to feed on transformed plants. A small amount of transformed plant matter is ingested. The ingested matter is processed in the insect midgut yielding the active polypeptide toxin which acts on the midgut cell membrane to kill or inhibit growth of the pest. Also in practice, when used alone or as one component in a formulation or composition, certain Lepidoptera and or Coleoptera larva attempt to feed on plants treated with said formulations or compositions. A small amount of treated plant matter is ingested. The ingested matter containing the formulation or composition is processed in the insect midgut yielding the polypeptide toxin which acts on the midgut cell membrane to kill or inhibit growth of the pest. Engineering of the present invention was generally accomplished as follows Different types of chimeric genes promotor gene fusions , have been used to genetically transform plant cells, and basically 3 different types of plant specific promotors can be distinguished Examples pGS1110, pGS1151, pGS1152, pGS1171, pGS1251, pGS1253, pGS1281. Alternative constructions of the desired transformation vectors described herein are also contemplated. For example, plant specific exogenous promotors other than those disclosed herein may be used. The use of a different exogenous promotor sequence may be useful for directing expression of the inserted exogenous DNA in a regulated fashion. Examples of other types of regulation which may be used include tissue specific expression leaves, roots, stems or flowers and inducible expression temperature, light or chemical factors . Additionally, given the DNA sequence data coding for the polypeptide endotoxins produced by The following examples are offered by way of illustration and should not be construed as limiting the scope of the present invention. Crystals were isolated and purified from spore preparations of strains B.t. berliner 1715 received from Dr. A. Klier, These solubilized crystal proteins exhibited a strong toxic activity towards third instar larvae of the cabbage butterfly Antisera against B.t. crystal proteins berliner 1715 and kurstaki were prepared separately in rabbits and mice. Antiserum against B.t. crystal proteins kurstaki prepared in goat was received courtesy of Dr. L. Bulla, University of Idaho. To the best of applicant s knowledge and belief, the antiserum was prepared by known procedures substantially similar to those described for rabbit and mouse. Rabbits were injected subcutaneously with 0.5 mg of a solubilized crystal protein preparation .25 ml dialysed qagainst PBS pH 7.4 mixed with an equal volume of complete Freund s adjuvant CFA . After three months, the rabbits received another injection of the same type of preparation, and three weeks later blood samples were taken. BALBc mice were injected intraperitoneally with 100 ug of crystal protein solution, mixed with CFA 1 1 vol. . Four to six weeks later they received a booster injection of 50 ug crystal protein PBS, and four days later blood samples were taken. Antigen reactivity of the sera was confirmed by immunodiffusion tests Ouchterlony assay . A strong crossreaction between berliner 1715 and kurstaki crystal protein preparations was observed, indicating that they contained antigenically related components. Some of the mice were sacrificed and the spleens removed asceptically for cell fusion experiments see 2.2 . Although not essential for the identification of toxin expressing clones as described herein, hybridomas producing monoclonal antibodies against B.t. crystal proteins were generated following the procedure originally described by Koehler and Milstein Spleen cells from immunized BALBc mice see 2.1 were fused with the SP2 0 myeloma cell line Shulman, M. et al., Kronstad et al., Several gene banks were constructed each containing between 600 and 1500 recombinant clones. Analysis of the recombinant plasmids present in 12 randomly chosen clones confirmed that in each gene bank at least 10 out of the 12 clones contained inserted fragments with sizes ranging from 5 to 15 Kb. The colonies of the gene bank were screened for bacteria producing crystal proteins using a rabbit serum raised against purified B.t. berliner crystal proteins see Section 2.1 above . The procedures used are slightly modified from Helfman et al., The Total cell protein extracts of These results demonstrate that the cloned Bt2 gene codes for one of the crystal proteins of B.t. berliner which is immunologically related to the 130Kd crystal protein of B.t. kurstaki. The amount of positively reacting material in bacterial extracts was quantitated using an ELISA assay. Using purified crystal protein as a standard, the amount of crystal protein produced in These semi purified protein preparations were used for further studies. Antisera were raised against Bt2 protein in rabbits and mice using a similar immunization protocol as described in Section 2.1. These antisera reacted equally well with solubilized crystal proteins from B.t. berliner and kurstaki as with Bt2 itself, in the ELISA assay described above Figure 8 shows results with the mouse serum . A similar positive reaction was observed using antibodies purified, from anti Bt crystal serum, by affinity chromatography on an immunoadsorbent of Bt2 Bt2 protein coupled onto CNBr activated Sepharose 4B, Pharmacia . These antibodies also reacted in Western blotting with a 130Kd protein present in both B.t. berliner and kurstaki crystals. Finally, in the ELISA, 9 out of the 17 monoclonal antibodies raised against total B.t. berliner crystal proteins, were also reactive with the Bt2 protein. Code numbers 1F6, 167, 4D6, 4F3, 8G10, 10E3, 1.7, 4.8, C73 Figure 9 . The same 9 antibodies were also reactive with B.t. kurstaki crystal proteins. In general both the Bt2 protein and the major 130 Kd crystal proteins from B.t. require alkaline pH and the presence of reducing reagents for complete solubilization. Also they both precipitate at pH 4 5. Thus, the cloned gene product Bt2 exhibits biochemical properties similar to those of the major 130 Kd crystal protein from B.t. berliner and B.t. kurstaki and is immunologically related to these crystal proteins. The Bt2 protein was purified further by DEAE ion exchange chromatography and by Sephacryl gel filtration. The amino terminal sequence of this purified protein was determined with the use of a gas phase sequencer Applied Biosystems , operated according to Hewick et al., The sequence of the first 20 N terminal amino acids was found to be substantially identical to the N terminal sequence deduced from the DNA sequence of a cloned B.t. kurstaki gene, Wong et al., Crystals from B.t. are known to be particularly toxic against larvae of certain Lepidoptera species. In order to test whether Bt2 protein exhibited a similar toxic activity, toxicity tests were performed on larvae of the cabbage butterfly To test the effect of sublethal doses of Bt2 toxin on the growth of These results indicate which levels of Bt2 protein synthesis must be reached in transformed plant cells in order to express insect resistance against To locate the Bt2 toxin gene on the 7.2 Kb BamHI PstI fragment of the pBt200 plasmid a series of deletions were made in the 7.2 Kb DNA fragment with respectively HpaI, KpnI and IbaI. The proteins encoded by these deletion plasmids were analyzed immunologically, using the ELISA technique and Western blotting also referred herein to as immunoblotting Towbin et al., The results diagrammed in Figure 11 can be summarized as follows 1 Deletion of the HpaI fragment results in the synthesis of an intact Bt2 protein at a lower level. This finding indicates that the deletion only affects the regulatory region but not the structural part of the gene. 2 Deletion of the Kpn fragment results in a approximately 70 Kd protein fragment still detectable by immunoblotting. 3 The Xba deletions closer to the 5 end do not give rise to protein fragments detectable by Western blotting procedure. These results show that the intact gene encoding the 130 Kd protein is located on a 4.3 Kb HpaI PstI fragment see Figure 11 . To determine the precise structure of the Bt2 gene, the complete nucleotide sequence of the 4,060 base pairs bp HpaI NdeI fragment was determined by the Maxam and Gilbert sequencing method. The sequencing strategy used is diagrammed in Figure 12. The proposed nucleotide sequence was confirmed primarily by sequencing the complementary strand. Examination of the sequence revealed the presence of a single large open reading frame starting at position 141 and ending at position 3605, which could code for a protein of 1,155 amino acids with a molecular weight of 127 Kd. This is in agreement with the molecular weight of 130 Kd of the Bt2 protein as determined by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Furthermore, the amino terminal amino acid sequence predicted from the nucleotide sequences agrees with the amino acid sequence determined on the purified Bt2 protein see Figures 10 and 13 . The complete amino acid sequence of the Bt2 toxin shows extensive homology with the deduced amino acid sequences from 3 other B.t. crystal proteins from which the genes were cloned and sequenced B.t. kurstaki HDl Dipel Schnepf et al., Comparison of these other B.t. sequences with our Bt2 at the amino acid level Figure 14 reveals that they encode similar but distinct proteins, showing regions of striking homology but also stretches which diverge significantly. Inspection of the DNA sequence of the Bt2 gene revealed that the 160 bp region immediately upstream of the ATG translation initiation codon contains 5 ATG triplets. Translation of eucaryotic genes usually starts at the first AUG in the message In RNA U replaces T . These AUG triplets might act as initiator AUG s and could be recognized preferentially over the genuine Bt2 initiation codon and could thus reduce the level of expression in transformed plant cells. Moreover, these AUG s are in other reading frames and would give rise to nonsense polypeptides. To prevent initiation of translation at these AUG triplets, the sequences upstream of the Bt2 gene were removed by exonucleolytic treatment, prior to insertion of the pBt2 gene in the Ti expression vectors. To this end, deletion derivatives of the pBT200 plasmid in which upstream sequences were deleted up to the initiator ATG were constructed. Thirty five ug of pBt200 DNA was digested with HpaI and treated with 6 units of Bal31 exonuclease Biolabs, New England for 1, 1.30, 2, 2.30 and 3 minutes in 300 ul of 12 mM MgCl₂, 12 mM CaCl₂, 0.6 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 20 mM tris HCl pH 8.0, at 30 C. One ug of Bal31 treated molecules of each reaction were ligated at 4 C to 0.13 ug phosphorylated BamHI linkers Biolabs, New England with 2 units T4 DNA ligase in a total volume of 20 ul. After the T4 ligase was inactivated at 68 C for 10 minutes, each ligation mix was digested with 20 units BamHI for 1 h at 37 C. Subsequently, 50 ng DNA was recircularized with 0.1 unit T4 DNA ligase in a total volume of 100 ul for 20 h at 4 C. One fifth of this ligation mixture was transformed into competent The deletion end points in the plasmids were first analyzed by measuring the size of the newly generated EcoRI fragments of the recombinant plasmids on a 2 agarose gel. The nucleotide sequences of the exact deletion end points in plasmids with deletions ending just before the start of the Bt2 gene were determined. Clone pHD100 has a deletion ending 8 bp before the initiator ATG and removes all upstream non initiator ATG s. Clone pBa3.3 contains the BamHI linker fused to the 4th bp of the coding sequence and clone pBa23 3 contains the Bam linker fused to bp 33. In a second engineering step, the non coding sequences at the 3 end of the toxin gene were deleted using Bal31 exonuclease Biolabs, New England . Thirty ug of pHD100 plasmid DNA were digested with NdeI and treated with Bal31 exonuclease for 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 minutes at 30 C in buffer. At each time interval, 60 ul aliquots each containing 6 ug of Bal31 treated DNA molecules were removed. After addition of phosphorylated BglII linkers Biolabs, New England to the Bal31 treated DNA molecules, the DNA molecules were recircularized with 0.1 U T4 ligase overnight at 4 C. The ligation mixture was transformed into competent In order to create plasmid pDC3 Figure 16 , plasmid pHD164 was digested with DraI, ligated to BglII linkers, and the fragment containing the Bt2 gene was cloned in the BglII site of pLK57 Figure 17 . In this way, the BglII site of the BamHI BglII cassette was placed in close proximity of the TAA stop codon of Bt2. Results from basic research on the functional properties of B.t. crystal proteins indicate that the large approximately 130 Kd crystal proteins are relatively insoluble and, in addition, are protoxins which need processing in the insect midgut towards lower molecular weight active toxins, able to exert their toxic effects on the insects Bulla, L. A., Jr., D. B. Bechtel, K. J. Kramer, Y. I. Shetna, A. I. Aronson and P. C. Fitz James, 1980, A gene coding for a 130 Kd crystal protein toxin of B.t. berliner 1715 has been cloned into pUC8 Viera and Messing, In order to assure a regulatable, high level expression in The resulting plasmids were assessed for the production of Bt2 protein and one of those producing the highest levels of Bt2, termed pLB10 was selected for further experiments. Plasmid pLB10 originated from pBa23 3 Figure 17, Section 7.1 . From the internal deletions previously made in pBt200 with XbaI and KpnI, only the KpnI deletion gave rise to immunologically detectable Bt2 derived protein see Section 6 . Deletions were made in pLB10 using restriction enzymes KpnI and HindIII. Western blotting analysis and ELISA showed that only the KpnI deletion mutant, containing the largest fragment extending from the start towards position 2167 of the Bt2 gene, produced a stable approximately 80 Kd polypeptide. The polypeptide encoded by the HindIII deletion derivative probably is highly sensitive to Interestingly, the KpnI deletion mutant encoded polypeptide exhibited an insecticidal activity that was equivalent to that of the intact Bt2 protein in one experiment the LD₅₀ value on 3rd instar The previous data suggests that the smallest gene fragment of Bt2, encoding an active toxin is contained within the KpnI deletion fragment but extends further than the HindIII site. To map the exact endpoint of the minimal fragment coding for the active toxin, deletion mutants were constructed which contained N terminal fragments of decreasing size. To achieve this, we used a strategy which allowed us to construct simultaneously deletion mutants and translational fusions to the NPTII gene see Section 7.2.2 . The construction of the intermediate plasmid pLBKm25 is outlined in Figure 18. As shown in Figure 18, pLBKm25 is derived from pLB10 see previous section and pLKm91 which will be described in Section 7.2.2.2. As shown, this plasmid is provided with a DNA sequence with stopcodons in the three reading frames behind an unique SalI site. This construct was cut with KpnI, digested with Bal31, cut with SalI, treated with Klenow polymerase and religated Figure 19 . In this way, the deleted coding region is fused to a stopcodon with a minimum of nonsense coding sequence. An overview of the deletion clones is given in Figure 20. Total cellular extracts were made of the clones after induction and analyzed in Western blotting and ELISA for the quantitative detection of Bt2 like polypeptides and in an insect toxicity assay to screen for active toxin. The results are presented in Figure 21 and indicate that detection of a stable polypeptide decreases gradually when the endpoint of the coding region is coming closer to the HindIII site. From a certain position on still downstream of HindIII , almost no Bt2 like protein was detectable anymore. Furthermore, toxicity of the extracted material from these clones, drops abruptly when the 3 endpoint is passing a particular position between HindIII and KpnI. The two clones characterizing the smallest toxic pLB879 and the largest nontoxic pLB834 polypeptide were verified by DNA sequence analysis. This analysis showed that the critical endpoint for a stable active toxin maps between positions 1797 and 1820 on the Bt2 gene Figure 22 . Therefore all N terminal gene fragments of Bt2, ending downstream of position 1820 bp comprise a gene fragment encoding an active toxin. Interestingly, total cellular extract of one clone pLB820 showed a much stronger reaction with a polyclonal antiserum and a monoclonal antibody in Western blotting. Moreover, the protein produced by this clone was more soluble in It is known that amino terminal fusions at the NPTII gene can generate fusion proteins that still confer kanamycin resistance in bacteria Reiss et al., Since NPTII is a most suitable selection marker in plant engineering, such gene fusions could have very promising applications. Indeed when using such NPTII fusion proteins to transform plants, a selection for high kanamycin resistance would allow direct selection for a high expression of the fusion product. Therefore, toxin gene fusions with NPTII might be used to transform plants and select for transformed plants expressing high levels of toxin, by selection for kanamycin resistance. Different fragments of the Bt2 gene were fused to the N terminus of NPTII. One of the fusion proteins termed Bt NPT2 is described in more detail below. The construction of the Bt NPT2 gene is shown in Figure 23. pLK54 is a pBR322 derivative containing the P A 1141 bp gene fragment of pKm109 90 containing the NPTII gene was cloned in pLK54 giving rise to pLKm90. In order to create a BglII site behind the NPTII gene, BglII linkers were ligated at the XbalI and the SalI site after Klenow polymerase treatment. This gives rise to pLKm91. pHD159 is a derivative of pBt200 Section 7.1 whereby a BamHI linker has been fused to the 4th bp and a BglII linker to bp 3342 after Bal31 treatment . The BamHI BglII fragment of this plasmid containing the deleted Bt2 gene was inserted in the BamHI site of pLKm91, in one orientation, giving rise to a Bt2 NPTII fusion gene on pLBKm10. To construct pLBKm13 an Asp 728, Klenow treated BglII fragment was inserted between the BamHI site after filling in and the BglII site of pLKm91. In order to produce the Bt NPTII fusion proteins in For the expression of the fusion protein Bt NPT2 behind the Pnos promotor and the 35S promotor, the BamHI SacI fragment of pHD160 described in Section 7.1 was cloned between the same sites in pLBKm13 giving pLBKm33. Finally for the construction with the Petunia ssu promotor see Section 8 we used a modified Bt NPTII cassette wherein the 3 non coding region was removed up to the stopcodon of NPTII. To achieve this the NCo1 BglII fragment of pLBKm13 containing the 3 end of the NPTII gene was replaced by a NCo1 BglII fragment generated from pLKm91 Figure 23 . This plasmid was cut with Ddel, treated with Klenow polymerase, and ligated to a BglII linker, whereafter the resulting DNA was cut by NCo1 and BglII. Figure 23 also shows the 5 Bt2 sequences in the different constructs. In summary, the Bt NPT2 gene contains Figure 24 The fusion gene Bt NPT2, placed behind the P An The protein could also be visualized in Western blotting using either anti Bt2 serum or anti NPTIII serum. Again the positively reacting band showed the expected size of the fusion protein. The protein is quite stable in The NPTII activity of the Bt NPT2 fusion protein was evaluated using an NPTII assay as described elsewhere Reiss et al., The results in the previous section indicate that specific NPTII enzyme activities of intact NPTII enzyme and of the fusion protein were substantially equivalent. This seems somewhat incompatible with the It is known, however, that proteins produced in Analysis of a bacterial extract of the Bt NPT2 clone using a Western blotting indicated that indeed nearly all the protein was present in an insoluble form. After lysis of the cells and centrifugation, most of detectable Bt NPT2 was found in the pellet this in contrast to the NPTII wild type protein which is mostly present in the supernatant fraction . Only a minor fraction of the Bt NPT2 protein was present in the supernatant. To solubilize the fusion protein, present in the pellet fraction, 8 M urea 2 ME mercapto ethanol was required. After dialysis, to renature the solubilized protein an enriched Bt NPT2 protein preparation was obtained which could be tested in insect toxicity assays see 2.4 . Previous toxicity assays have shown that the polypeptide encoded by the KpnI deletion fragment of Bt2 has still 100 of the toxic activity of the intact Bt2 protein Section 7.2.1.2 . In addition, our studies on the identification of minimal active toxic fragments have shown that this Kpn fragment comprises a approximately 60 Kd active toxin which exhibits the complete toxic activity of the Bt2 molecule. In the following, we wanted to determine whether the Bt NPT2 fusion protein had still the same degree of toxicity. To this end, toxicity levels towards insect larvae, of enriched Bt NPT2 and purified Bt2 protein were compared. The exact amount of fusion protein in the samples was determined using ELISA with a monoclonal antibody specific for the N terminal region of Bt2 4D6 and Western blotting comparison of band intensity of dilutions of the fusion protein and purified Bt2 . The results showed that the specific toxic activity on Taken together the above data indicate that the Bt NPT2 protein has NPTII activity both The results obtained with the previously constructed Bt NPTII gene were very promising since this fusion protein conferred kanamycin resistance, showed normal levels of toxicity and was relatively stable. However, the kanamycin resistance conferred by the Bt NPT2 fusion was relatively low as compared to the wild type cells. Since the isolated purified Pnos Bt NPT2 protein had a specific NPTII activity comparable to the wild type NPTII protein, we concluded that the low kanamycin resistance was due to the low solubility of the fusion protein in We used plasmid pLBKm25 Figure 18 containing the following elements of interest a P 145 kanamycin resistant transformants were screened for their ability to grow on higher kanamycin concentrations. 8 transformants proved more resistant and were able to grow on concentrations higher than 200 ug ml of kanamycin. The fusion point in all 8 clones was determined by restriction enzyme mapping with an accuracy of 20 bp. Surprisingly 7 out of 8 clones had their fusion point around the HindIII site at position 1680 of the Bt gene. One clone pLBKm860 mapped at position approximately 2050. Although the majority of the deletions were fused around position 1800, none of these conferred a higher kanamycin resistant phenotype. The 7 clones which have their fusion point positioned around the HindIII site are too short to encode an active toxin. However, one of the clones pLBKm860 was More stable, since more protein per amount of total cellular extract was detected in Western blot analysis and More soluble since more truncated Bt protein was detected in the supernatant. The positions of the 3 end points in the Bt2 coding sequences in clones 860 and 865 are represented in Figure 26. Toxicity of the fusion proteins and truncated Bt2 gene products is illustrated in Table 6. Plasmids pLBKm860 and 865 were modified as described in Figure 27 to generated plasmids pLBKm1860 and pLBKm1865 respectively. pLBKm2860 was derived from Figure 27 pLBKm860. By replacing the BamHI SacI fragment from pLB820 and 884 for the BamHI SacI fragment of pLBKm14, the new plasmids called pLB1820 and 1884 respectively, were generated. pLB2820 was derived from pLB1820. As an example, the final constructs pLBKm1860, pLBKm1865 and pLBKm2860 are shown in Figure 24. Table 7 gives an overview of the engineered plasmids which have been constructed and used in the plant tranformation experiments. Each engineered Ti plasmid is the result of a cointegration of a receptor Ti plasmid with an intermediate vector. Each intermediate vector contains a chimeric toxin gene comprising a plant promotor sequence derived from the indicated expression vector and a Bt gene cassette. Table 7 gives the plasmids from which the Bt gene cassettes are isolated. The construction of these plasmids has been described in previous parts. The detailed maps of the expression vectors mentioned in Table 7 are given in Figure 33 A J . The detailed construction of the two chimeric genes present in pHD205 and pHD208 are described as an example. The experimental procedure uses standard recombinant DNA techniques and experimental protocols have been followed, according to Maniatis Cold Spring Harbor, 1982 . The different plant promotors which have been used are Table 7 Pnos a constitutive and relatively weak promotor derived from the T DNA encoded nopaline synthase gene. Pssu pea derived from a weakly expressed member of the family of small Subunit of Ribulose biphosphatecarboxylase genes of pea. Expression is light inducible in green tissues. PTR2 A constitutive promotor derived from the T Cloning into the BamHI site thus leaves the 5 untranslated region of the 2 gene intact and fuses the Bt gene cassette at the initiation ATG of the 2 gene. The importance of an intact 5 untranslated region for obtaining high levels of expression of chimeric genes has been demonstrated Jones et al., created a BglII site. As a result, the coding region of the ssu 301 gene could be precisely removed by NcoI BglII digest and substituted by the Bt gene cassettes described under 7.2. Isolation and characterization of the promotor fragment Pssu PET and 3 end ssu PET is described in Dean et al., P35S is a strong constitutive promotor derived from cauliflower mosaic virus CAMV . The P35S 1 promotor fragment is derived from CAMV isolate Cm4 184. It contains a fragment nt6492 7454 of the CAMV genome Gardner et al., 1981, P35S 2 contains CAMV sequences from 6492 to 7466 followed by a ClaI site. P35S 1 and P35S 2 thus only differ in the length of the 5 untranslated sequences of the 35S CAMV transcript. Figure 28 gives the DNA sequences at the junction between the promotor regions and the coding sequence of the Bt gene cassettes as they are present in the different engineered Ti plasmids. Sequences derived from the original promotor regions and from the coding sequence of the Bt2 gene are underlined. Some relevant restriction enzyme sites which have been involved in the assembly of the chimeric genes are indicated. The ATG initiation codon is boxed. All chimeric genes are provided at the 3 end with a sequence which contains the 3 untranslated region, including the polyadenylation site, of a gene which is naturally expressed in plant cells. The following sequences have been used A 706 bp PvuII fragment containing the 3 untranslated region of the octopine synthase gene pos 11939 11233 according to Gielen et al., A 212 bp EcoRV ClaI fragment containing the 3 untranslated region of T DNA gene 7, cloned into the SmaI site of pUC8 and reisolated as a EcoRI SalI fragment pos 2317 2105 according to Gielen et al., A 182 bp Ta9I ClaI fragment, containing the 3 untranslated region of the nopaline synthase gene pos 1290 1472 according to Depicker et al., A approximately 1.2 Kb BglII BamHI fragment derived from the 3 end of the ssu301 gene was constructed by site directed mutagenesis as follows This example describes the construction of pHD205, an intermediate vector containing a chimeric Bt2 toxin gene comprising the nopaline synthase promotor, the Bt2 toxin gene cassette from pHD160 and a DNA fragment containing the 3 untranslated region of the nopaline synthase gene including the polyadenylation site. In the chimeric gene the Bt2 gene cassette is oriented such that the expression of the Bt2 protein can be obtained from the nopaline synthase promotor. The Bt2 gene cassette was excised from pHD160 with BamHI and BglII and inserted in the BamHI site of pLGV2382 Herrera Estrella et al., This example describes the construction of pHD208. The intermediate vector pHD208 contains a chimeric Bt2 toxin gene comprising the promotor from a pea gene encoding a small subunit of ribulose biphosphate carboxylase Pssu , the Bt2 toxin gene cassette from pHD160 and the 3 untranslated region of the octopine synthase gene including the polyadenylation site. The fragments of the chimeric gene were assembled in the cloning vector pGV831 as described in this example and as diagrammed in Figure 29. The construction of pGV831 is summarized in Figure 30. Five ug of pGV831 DNA was totally digested with 5u HpaI at 37 C for 1 h, using the incubation buffer described by Maniatis et al., The resulting DNA fragments were separated by electrophoresis on a horizontal agarose gel 0.8 agarose in TBE buffer . The agarose band containing the 706 bp PvuII fragment was cut out and the DNA was recovered by electroelution. After phenolisation and ether extraction, DNA was precipitated with ethanol by centrifugation in an Eppendorf centrifuge for 10 minutes, washed with 70 ethanol, dried and resuspended in 20 ul H₂O. 0.03 ug HpaI digested and CIP treated pGV831 was ligated to 0.1 ug of the purified 706 bp fragment with 1U of T4 ligase in a final volume of 10 ul. The ligation mixture was transformed into competent A BamHI site was positioned immediately downstream of the Pssu promotor by inserting the HindIII BamHI polylinker from pUC8 Vierra and Messing, Five ug of pGV858 were digested with 5 units of BamHI for 1 h at 37 C in a final volume of 20 ul, using the incubation buffer described by Maniatis et al., 0.2 ug BamHI digested and CIP treated pGV858 was ligated to 0.05 ug BamHI BglII PvuI digested pGV861 with 0.01 units of T4 DNA ligase Boehringer Mannheim in a final volume of 20 ul. The ligation mixture was transformed into competent In one of the recombinant plasmids, pHD503, the BglII BamHI fragment including the pea ssu promotor is inserted in the correct orientation in front of the 3 end of the octopine synthase gene. pHD503 contains a unique BamHI site, located between the Pssu promotor and the 3 end of the octopine synthase gene. The ligation mixture was transformed into competent This example describes the construction of pGSH151. The intermediate vector pGSH151 contains a chimeric Bt NPTII fusion gene comprising the promotor of transcript 2 of the TR DNA of the octopine Ti plasmid PTR2 Velten et al., 1984, The fragments of the chimeric gene were assembled as described in this example. All the techniques were performed as described in Maniatis et al., This plasmid contains the TR promotor PTR2 with a completely intact 5 untranslated region, followed by an ATG initiation codon, followed by a unique BamHI site, and the 3 untranslated end of the transcript 7 gene. pOP443 Velten et al., 1984 contains a ClaI HdIII fragment comprising the PTR2 and the PTR1 of the octopine Ti plasmid. To eliminate the BamHI site, pOP443 was totally digested with BamHI and SalI, the sticky ends treated with the Klenow fragment of After transformation, ampicillin resistant colonies were selected and their plasmids were screened for the absence of BamHI and SalI sites, yielding pOP4433SF. In order to create a ClaI site in front of the 3 untranslated end of transcript 7 in pAP2034 Velten et al., 1984 , pAP2034 was totally digested with BamHI, treated with the Klenow fragment of From pOP443BSF, the ClaI HindIII fragment containing the TR promotors was cloned between the corresponding sites of pAP2034C giving rise to pGSH50. pGV825 is described in Deblaere et al., pGSH50 was digested with EcoRI, treated with the klenow fragment of The BamHI BglII fragment of pLBKm13 containing the Bt2 gene was cloned in the BamHI site of pGSH150 creating an in frame fusion of the Bt2 gene starting at the 2nd codon to an ATG initiation codon behind the PTR2. The introduction of intermediate expression vectors into acceptor Ti plasmids of As an example, the cointegration of pHD205 with pGV3850 and of pHD208 with pGV2260 is described. Intermediate vectors and receptor Ti plasmids used are listed in Table 7 and represented in Figures 31 33. The intermediate expression vector pHD205 was inserted into the acceptor Ti plasmid pGV3850 to yield the hybrid Ti plasmid pHD1050. As diagrammed in Figure 31, pHD1050 contains the chimeric Bt2 gene under the control of the Pnos promotor, as well as the nopaline synthase gene positioned between T DNA border fragments. The plasmid pHD205 was introduced into competent Liquid LB medium was innoculated with one of the pHD205 transformed The intermediate expression vector pHD208 was inserted into the acceptor Ti plasmid pGV2260 to yield the hybrid Ti plasmid pHD1076. As diagrammed in Figure 32 pHD1076 contains the chimeric Bt2 gene under the control of the Pssu promotor as well as a chimeric gene containing the neomycin phosphotransferase gene under the control of the Pnos promotor, positioned between T DNA border fragments. The Ti plasmid pGV2260 is described in European Patent Application Number 83112985.3 Publication Number 0116718 . The plasmid pHD208 was introduced into competent Liquid LB medium was inoculated by one of the transformed Transconjugants were purified on LB medium Miller, The intermediate expression vector pGSH151 was inserted into the acceptor Ti plasmid pGV2260 to yield the hybrid Ti plasmid pGS1151. The method used was a triparental cross according to Dittag et al. 1980 , Liquid LB medium was inoculated with one of the pGSH151 transformed The cells were collected from the LB plates and dilutions were plated on minimal A. medium Miller, Two different protocols are described here for the transformation of tobacco plant cells with transformation vectors such as those described in Section 9 and for the generation of callus tissue and or differentiated plants from these transformed cells. This procedure describes the cocultivation of tobacco protoplasts with The leaf disc also at times referred to herein as leaf segments assay for testing Km resistance of a plant is performed as follows. Small discs are cut out from After three weeks incubation in a plant tissue culture room, callus growth on the leaf discs is monitored. The Km resistance level of the plant is determined as the highest concentration of Km on which the leaf discs still give rise to callus tissue. Screening for the presence of nopaline nopaline assay is performed according to the procedures described in Aerts M., Jacobs M., Hernalsteens J P., Van Montagu M. and Schell J. 1979 Medium 56 is the same as medium 55 except for the addition of naphthalene acetic acid at 0.2 mg l and glutamine 1 mM. This procedure describes the infection of leaf segments with C58Cl Rif Sterile Approximately 250 calli have been screened for nopaline and 19 were Nos , which represents a high efficiency of transformation. In total 180 different callus lines, both nos and nos , generated from these transformation experiments have been screened for the presence of Bt2 using the sensitive ELISA described above Section 5.1 . Most of the clones were tested early after transformation during the initial phase of propagation when only 5 mm diameter and some were retested after a period of subculturing 3 months later . On the basis of the immunoassay results, a number 25 of callus lines were selected for plant regeneration. From each callus several plants were regenerated, and each of them received a distinct number total of 149 plants . The 149 plants were propagated T DNA Following procedure 1, kanamycin resistant protoplast clones were obtained and grown as calli. Calli were selected at random and were put in generation medium for shoot formation. Shoots developed and isolated from these kanamycin resistant clones were propagated as plants Following procedure 2, kanamycin resistant callus tissue and shoots were induced. Uncloned callus tissue was kept in continuous culture Using conditions described in procedure 2 either callus transformation of shoot induction was performed on the infected leaf discs. Using the callus induction protocol, a number of calli were obtained by partial purification and maintained as separated semi clones. On the basis of positive immunoassay results 5 of these lines were selected for further propogation 1076 4, 10, 11, 12, 13 . From the shoot induction protocol used in the initial stage of leaf disc infection a number 72 of kanamycin resistant plants were regenerated selection on 50 ug ml Km . When retested by leaf disc assay 65 of these proved to be truly resistant to 50 ug ml Km. From leaves of some Kanamycin resistant calli and shoot were induced following procedure 2. Approximately 20 kanamycin resistant callus lines were analyzed for nopaline expression and all were found positive. 86 kanamycin resistant shoots were selected, propagated 52 plants 60 were both kanamycin resistant and nopaline positive, and these were further propagated Leaf discs from About 70 shoots were rescued from the pGS1110 transformation experiment. Screening among 35 of these shoots showed that 28 of these 85 were real transformants since they produced nopaline. This important observation suggests that, although the shoots have not been maintained for a long period on Km containing medium, phenotypical selection for the expression of the fusion protein had occurred. The obtained shoots were propagated For a number of plants, copies were transferred into vermiculite pots. When reaching 10 15 cm height a first insect toxicity test was performed on leaves of these plants see section 13 . Leaf discs from Leaf discs from Shoot formation and development of shoots on medium containing 50 mg l kanamycin sulphate was slightly slower on discs treated with pGS1151 than in control discs pGS1160 . After three weeks discs were transferred to fresh selective medium and after another four weeks the best growing shoots were transferred to kanamycin free medium. The shoots were propagated Copies of the plants were transferred to pots and grown in the greenhouse. On a selected set of plants, those showing high Km resistance, detailed insect toxicity tests were performed see Section 13 . The level of Km Leaf discs obtained from Leaf discs obtained from Expression of Bt2 in engineered plants either callus tissue or differentiated plants was monitored using the ELISA described in Section 5 and adapted for assaying plant extracts. Conditions for preparing and assaying plant extracts were established in reconstruction experiments in which purified Bt2 protein was mixed with plant extracts. In reconstruction experiments we observed no significant loss in antigenic activity of Bt2 protein less than 20 due to the presence of plant extracts. In the ELISA assay, as little as 0.1 mg ml purified Bt2 protein was still detectable. However, in reconstruction experiments a certain variability in background occurs, probably caused by plant proteins present in extracts. Therefore, reliable detection limit in these conditions was of the order of 1 ng g tissue, which corresponds to a level of 2 ng Bt2 protein per g of plant tissue. For the immunological screening of individual calli, the following experimental procedure was established Two hundred mg of callus tissue was mixed with 150 200 ul of extraction buffer. Extraction buffer had the following composition 50 of a solution of Na₂ CO₃ 500 mM and DIT 100 mM and 50 fetal calf serum. The tissue was homogenized by crunching with a spatula whereafter the cell debris were centrifuged. Fifty ul of supernatants was added to 50 ul of PBS pH 7.4 10 fetal calf serum in wells of a microtiter plate coated with goat antibodies against B.t. crystal protein as described. During the entire procedure the samples were kept in ice and the microtiter plates were incubated at 4 C for 1.5 2 hours. Thereafter the ELISA procedure was continued as described in 5.1 for detection of Bt2 protein with either rabbit anti Bt2 serum or with a mixture of monoclonal anti Bt2 antibodies 4D6, 10E3, 1.7, and 4.8 under the form of culture supernatants . Transformed callus clones were obtained through the protoplast cocultivation method as described in Section 10 Example 10.1. Since 19 of the clones were found to express nopaline Nos , at least 19 of them were transformed. However, due to an additional border sequence in the intermediate expression vector pLGV2382 the nos gene and the Bt2 gene can be inserted independently as well as tandemly. Therefore both Nos and Nos clones were screened in the ELISA assay. A total of 180 callus clones 130 nos , 50 nos were tested. Some of the clones were retested once or twice at different time intervals after the initial propagation from protoplast culture. In none of the cases could a clear positive signal be recorded. When the substrate reaction times of the assay were prolonged overnight incubation at 4 C some of the clones both nos and nos produced a very weak signal above the background background being control callus without Bt2 gene . However, since the obtained values were clearly below the reliable detection limit of the test system, no firm conclusions could be drawn concerning the expression of Bt2 protein in these calli. Transformed callus tissue obtained from leaf segment infections using Agrobacterium strain C58Cl Rif After initial propagation calli were transferred for a second time after 20 days. When they reached optimal growth, 200 mg was used from each callus line for immunological screening in the ELISA. In a first experiment 9 out of 14 transformed calli showed a positive signal clearly above the background obtained with the 4 control calli untransformed SR 1 callus , when reacted with a specific rabbit anti Bt2 serum. see Figure 34 . Three transformed calli generated a signal corresponding to approximately 5 ng Bt2 protein per gram tissue, as determined by comparison with a positive control control SR 1 mixed with a known amount of Bt2 protein . All samples gave signals equal to background level signals obtained with SR 1 control callus when reacted with normal rabbit serum as a negative control. In a second experiment 13 out of 21 transformed calli yielded a signal significantly above background Figure 35 . One of the calli generated a signal corresponding to 4 ng of Bt2 per gram tissue. These results indicate that Bt2 protein is produced at a detectable level in a fraction of the calli transformed with pHD1076. About 5 weeks after the first ELISA experiments, 4 selected lines 1076 10, 11, 12 and 13 which in the initial screening gave high positive values, were retested in ELISA. From each line several subclones were tested the original callus had been divided in pieces which were propagated independently in the next growth cycle each new piece is referred herein to as a subclone . From 1076 10, one subclone was positive, one negative, from 1076 12, 2 subclones were positive, from 1076 13, 3 subclones were positive, 2 were negative. These results indicate that callus tissue originally scored as B.t. positive might, when further propagated, give rise to B.t. negative callus. In order to perform detailed immunoassay screenings with an increased sensitivity of detection, concentrated extracts from larger amounts of transformed callus tissues were prepared. The procedure developed here for obtaining an extract enriched in Bt2 protein, is based on the property of Bt2 to precipitate at pH 4 5. Transformed calli using pHD1076 were grown on medium containing 0.05 mg ml kanamycin sulfate and 140 g of uncloned transformed calli were collected a pool of callus lines 1076 4, 10, 11, 12, 13 and a number of unscreened lines . An extract was made by homogenizing the calli in the presence of 70 ml extraction buffer Na₂CO₃ 500 mM, pH 10, DIT 5 mM, PMFS 170 ug ml . The supernatant obtained after centrifugation at 15,000 rpm was diluted by adding 50 ml phosphate buffered saline pH 7.5. Subsequently the pH of the diluted extract was brought to pH 6 with 1 M HCl and it was incubated for 20 minutes at 0 C and the supernatant isolated by centrifugation and stored at 0 C fraction pH 6 . When pH was brought down to 4.5 a new precipitate was isolated fraction pH 4.5 in the same way. The pellets were washed once with H₂O and subsequently incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature in the following buffer Na₂CO₃ 500 mM pH 10, DTT 50 mM, PMSF 170 ug ml pellet pH 6 in 1.5 ml and pellet pH 4.5 in 2 ml . The material solubilizing in these conditions was isolated after centrifugation at 15,000 rpm and these samples were called 1076 pH 6 and 1076 pH 4.5 respectively. A completely identical procedure was used to prepare extracts from normal SR 1 callus material used here as a negative control and resulted in two preparations called SR 1 pH 4.5. Total protein content in these samples was In order to evalaute the efficiency of the procedure a reconstruction experiment was done in which 1 ug of purified Bt2 was added to 20 g of SR 1 control callus tissue at the initiation of the sample homogenization. Presence of Bt2 protein in these extracts was determined using the ELISA with goat anti Bt crystal serum and rabbit anti Bt2, 6002 . A strong reaction was recorded in fraction 1076 pH 4.5 as compared to the negative control SR 1 . Fraction 1076 pH 6 gave a signal which was only slightly higher than SR 1 pH 6, indicating that this fraction only contained a minor part of the Bt2 protein content. In the ELISA, fraction 1076 pH 4.5 also gave a significant reaction with five different monoclonal antibodies, specific for Bt2 protein, namely 1.7, 4D6, 4.8, 10E3 and 1F6 see Figure 36 . This strongly indicates that fraction 1076 pH 4.5 contains Bt2 protein which is in the same configuration as the bacterial Bt2. In the following we attempted to remove Bt2 protein from the extract using a procedure of immunoprecipitation. A 5 volume of rabbit anti Bt2 serum was added to the extract which was incubated at 4 C for 1 hour. Subsequently a 5 volume of goat anti rabbit Ig serum was added, followed by 1.5 hours incubation at 4 C. The precipitate was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant was tested in the ELISA. This supernatant contained at least 10 times less Bt2 activity than the original 1076 pH 4.5 fraction, indicating that the material which generated the positive signals in ELISA could be specifically removed by anti Bt2 antibodies, again confirming the Bt2 nature of the positively reacting substance in ELISA. In a next experiment the above samples were dialysed against carbonate buffer pH 10. A quantitative determination of the Bt2 content of extract 1076 pH 4.5 was performed by testing dilutions of the extract and a solution of purified Bt2 protein as a standard in the ELISA. The value determined was 122 ng Bt2 ml extract total volume 2 ml . Reconstruction experiments Bt2 added to SR 1 control callus at the beginning of the extraction , indicated that only 20 of Bt2 protein is lost during the extraction procedure and that 80 is contained in the pH 4.5 fraction. Based on these results, one could calculate that the total amount of Bt2 protein originally present in 140 g callus was 305 ng, which is 2.2 ng g, a result that agrees well with the original estimates made for the screening of individual calli see Figures 34 and 35 . These data show that Bt2 protein present in extracts from transformed calli can be specifically concentrated using a precipitation procedure at pH 4.5 as described above, allowing us to quantify more accurately the amount of Bt2 protein produced in these plant tissues. A 500 g pool of selected callus clones on the basis of previous ELISA tests on individual calli, approximately 25 callus lines, which gave values above background, were selected and homogenized in the presence of 1000 ml extraction buffer using the same procedure as described in Example 1. Material which remained soluble at pH 6, but precipitated at pH 4.5 was isolated by centrifugation and subsequently redissolved in a small volume of carbonate buffer pH 10 see Example 11.2.1 . Analysis of the material in ELISA revealed positive signals corresponding to 60 ng ml Bt2 or 1.2 ng g callus tissue Table 8 . In this example a slightly different and more extensive extraction protocol was used for the isolation of Bt2 protein from the engineered plant material. A protocol was developed to recover eventual residual Bt2 protein that would not be solubilized in a single extraction step as used in the procedures of Examples 11.2.1 and 11.2.2. Such could be the case, since Bt2 protein contains some highly hydrophobic regions which possibly interact with plant cell membrane structures and therefore would be difficult to solubilize in the absence of detergents. The step by step procedure used here would allow the recovery of additional proteins associated with insoluble plant cell structure. A schematic representative of the protocol is given in Figure 37. A first protein fraction is obtained by extraction in carbonate buffer pH 10 DTT and concentration through acid precipitation pH 4.5 fraction I . This fraction corresponds to the pH 4.5 extract obtained using the procedure in Examples 11.2.1 and 11.2.2. Material not solubilized in this first extraction step and remaining in the pellet is then treated with the same extraction buffer containing 1 Triton X 100. Proteins, solubilizing in these conditions and precipitating at pH 4.5 are contained in fraction II. The last step involves solubilization in 2 SDS followed by acetone precipitation, yielding fraction III. Fractions I and II are analysed in ELISA and Western blotting fraction III, which contains SDS, is only analysed in Western blotting. ELISA results are given in Table 8 positive signals were detected in fractions I and II of both constructions 1060 and 1080, corresponding to Bt2 levels of respectively 1.9 and 1.4 ng g original tissue fr. I and 0.27 and 0.29 ng g fr. II . Western blotting of the SDS solubilized material fraction III revealed the presence of a faint approximately 130 Kd band for both 1060 and 1080 callus material using rabbit anti Bt2 serum . Detection limit of the Western blotting was 10 ng lane, therefore these fractions contained at least 0.39 ng g for 1060 and 0.5 ng g for 1080. Western blotting of fractions I of 1050, 1060 and 1080 did not reveal the presence of a 130 Kd band probably because the concentration of Bt2 protein is too low in these fractions. The present results indicate that low levels of Bt2 protein are indeed expressed in calli transformed with pHD1060 and pHD1080. Although small scale analysis of individual calli might not allow detection of immunopositive clones in these constructions, a more rigorous extraction and concentration procedure on a pool of selected calli clearly results in reliable and quantitative detection of Bt2 protein. A substantial fraction of the Bt2 was strongly bound to insoluble plant material and could only be released upon use of detergents such as Triton and SDS. For the routine testing of leaf samples the following procedure was established Green leaf tissue 200 400 mg was taken from Leaves from the From 70 plants tested, 5 gave a clear positive reaction above background obtained with leaves of untransformed SR 1 corresponding to Bt2 levels ranging from 6 to 25 ng per gram wet tissue see Table 9 . One of the plants with the highest value plant no 161 9 25 ng was studied in more detail. Leaf extract reacted positively with a rabbit anti Bt2 serum and with a mixture of monoclonal antibodies specific for the Bt2 molecule undiluted culture supernatants from clones 1.7, 4.8, 4D6, 10E3 . Furthermore it did not react with a pool of monoclonals displaying an irrelevant specificity. The plant extract was retested at least twice after freezing at 20 C and thawing, using the same reagents. Identical results were obtained each time, however, the level of Bt2 declines gradually with each cycle of freezing thawing, probably as a result of Bt2 protein degradation. Plant 161 9 was retested after it had been propagated in greenhouse conditions at a stage when it was about to flower. Again a clear positive signal was obtained, this time corresponding to a level of approximately 5 ng Bt2 gram tissue. This result indicates that the levels of Bt2 protein detected in engineered plant leaves might vary considerably depending on the plants age, growth conditions, etc. Screening of 76 Leaf extracts from About 30 The data outlined in Section 11.1, Example 11.1.2, 11.3, Example 11.3.3 suggests that the Pssu promotor constructions used here pHD1076 are less active in differentiated plant leaves than in callus. To investigate this further, new callus tissue was generated from leaves of the same plants used in the previous assays. Leaf discs were cultured on callus inducing medium and a few weeks later the callus material was collected and analyzed in a similar procedure the only difference being that a Tris pH 7.5 buffer was used in the Step I extraction instead of a Na₂ CO₃ pH 10 DTT buffer . Callus, induced simultaneously from untransformed SR 1 leaves, was used as negative control. ELISA analysis of the pHD1076 transformed calli revealed detectable amounts of Bt2 protein Table 10 . These results show that a chimeric gene with the Pssu promotor from pea in the construction used herein is functional and induces expression of Bt2 protein in tobacco callus tissue derived from leaves, that did not express detectable amounts of the same protein. Thus a chimeric gene that directs expression in undifferentiated callus tissue may not necessarily be active to the same extent if at all in differentiated plant leaves. Toxicity assays were performed on first instar larvae of Manduca sexta, fed on artificial diet. Three to four ml of liquid artificial diet Bell, R.A. Joachim, F.G. 1976 A concentrated extract from a pool of calli, transformed with pHD1076 was prepared as described in Section 11.2 Example 11.2.1. Extract dilutions were applied onto the surface of the diet and its toxicity was evaluated. The extracted material 1076 pH 4.5 clearly had a toxic effect on the Manduca sexta larvae at 12.5 ul cm² all larvae showed growth inhibition and at 50 ul cm² 100 died Table 11 . Toxic activity of this material was significantly diminished after immunoprecipitation 100 normal growth at 12.5 and 25 ul cm² and only 37 death at 50 ul cm² , indicating that the toxic activity can be depleted by anti Bt2 antibodies. Extract from untransformed SR 1 callus tissue, the negative control, was completely nontoxic. Since the presence of Bt2 protein in the extracts was quantified immonologically, we could correlate the observed toxicity with the determined Bt2 conce ntration. The immunoassay values indicated that 1076 pH 4 contained 122 ng ml Bt2. Thus, 50 ul extract per cm² corresponds to 6.1 ng Bt2 protein cm². Previous toxicity assays with Bt2 on Manduca Section 5.2, Table 3 indicated that Bt2 at 12 ng cm² is 100 lethal while 2.5 ng cm² induces growth inhibition. Together these results indicate that the Bt2, expressed in engineered callus tissue, is a functional toxin and displays toxicity which is in the same range of potency as the bacterial Bt2 gene product. In order to evaluate the insecticidal activity expressed in leaves of transformed tobacco plants the growth rate and mortality of Manduca sexta larvae feeding on these leaves was recorded and compared with the growth rate of larvae feeding on untransformed SR 1 leaves. The following procedures were used Subsequent experiments were carried out on leaf discs placed in Petri dishes. Four leaf discs of 4 cm diameter were punched out, placed on wet filter paper on a Petri dish together with 4 x 10 first instar larvae of In order to estimate the toxin levels required to have a notable effect on growth rate and viability of Manduca sexta larvae in the present experiment, a series of reconstruction experiments had to be included. To this end purified solubilized Bt2 protein Section 5.1 was serially diluted in PBS containing 0.5 Triton X 100. Standard volumes of Bt2 solution were mechanically sprayed to obtain a very homogenous coating on tobacco leaf discs. Ten L1 first instar larvae were placed on each leaf disc, and 3 discs were used per Bt2 concentration. Growth rate and mortality of the larvae were followed over a 100 hour period. A procedure essentially similar to the previous one was also used. This experimental protocol was however somewhat more extensive in order to be more effective in reliably detecting very small effects on larval growth rate. The set up was different from the previous one in the following aspects The plants used in this set up were grown in the greenhouse until they reached a height of 60 80 cm, but were not flowering yet. Leaf discs were cut out, placed on wet filter paper in Petri dishes and 10 first instar larvae were placed on each disc. Per plant, five groups of 10 larvae were used 5 leaf discs . Growth rate and mortality were followed over a 7 day period at this time nearly 100 of the controls were in the L₃ stage . Plants transformed with pHD1050, 1060, 1076 and 1080 were screened in the insect assay following procedure 1. No significant effect on growth rate and viability of the larvae could be recorded using this procedure. Results of a reconstruction experiment with purified bacterial Bt2 protein were as follows Growth inhibition but no mortalilty was observed at 25 ng g and approximately 50 mortality at 50 ng g. An extensive toxicity test using procedure 2 was done on a number of transformed plants that were previously scored as Bt in immunoassays. These plants were 161 9 Pnos Bt2, nos pHD1050 Example 1 Section 10 147 Pnos Bt2, nos pHD1050 Example 1 Section 10 174 Pssu Tp Bt2, Km , nos pHD1080 Example 4 Section 10 As controls a Bt plant 161 6 and an untransformed SR 1 were used. Results are presented in Table 12. Below are the weight values calculated for the 5 largest larvae from each group of 10. These results are compatible with the kinetics of the L3 L4 transition control larvae are somewhat larger than larvae feeding on Bt plants. Insect toxicity assays were done on leaves of plants obtained from the transformation procedure with pGS1110 Section 10, Example 10.5 . Plants were 10 20 cm and tests were performed following procedure 1. L1 L2 transition was monitored and 2 groups of 10 larvae were used per plant. A significant growth inhibition effect, exhibited by some of the plants on The same plants were also screened for the presence of nopaline and for resistance against kanamycin, in order to determine whether they were real transformants. The results of the screening data on the plants used in the present insect tests are compiled in Table 14. All four plants that showed an effect on larval growth are among the positive transformants, since they are Kanamycin resistant Km Insect toxicity assays were performed on leaves of plants generated through transformation with pGS1151 Section 10, Example 10.7 . Plants were 15 30 cm high at the time of testing and had been grown in greenhouse conditions. Two independent experiments are described below some of the plants tested in the first experiment were retested in Experiment II, in order to confirm the observed toxicity effects. The test was performed as described in Procedure 2 this section except that only two groups of ten larvae were used per plant newly hatched Growth rate and mortality of the larvae were followed over a 7 day period and the larval weight at the end of this period was determined. Detailed results from Experiment I are represented in Table 15 and indicate that larvae feeding on several plants transformed with pGS1151 show significant growth inhibition in the initial stage of the experiment, as compared to larvae feeding on a control plant. For example, after 71 h, 60 of the larvae feeding on control plant N21 107 have gone to the L2 stage, while the number of L2 larvae is only 15 or less on plants N21 18, 43, 53, 50 and 11. When followed over a longer period, significant mortality was recorded in the larvae feeding on pGS1151 transformed plants. On one of the plants N21 11 , mortality reached 100 after less than 7 days. Mortality on the control plant only reached 15 on day 7 and 45 of the larvae had already gone to the L3 stage this in contrast to the other plants having substantially no L3 larvae on day 7 . Results from a second insect test II involving newly hatched Tobacco plants transformed with pGS1151 and selected for high Km resistance clearly induce severe toxic effects on larvae feeding on these plants. The effects on insect larvae observed here, are the same as those induced by the B.t. toxin of bacterial origin see Section 5.2, Tables 2 and 3 that is, growth inhibition in the initial stage retardation in the transition from one instar to the next followed by death. It is apparent from Table 17 that the plants exhibiting the highest levels of Km resistance 500 ug ml Km also induce the highest mortality rates. Thus, using the fusion protein construction, we were able to select for efficient expression of toxicity by selecting for Km resistance. It should be noted that the use of a fusion protein, as described herein, may represent a particular advantage, not only because direct selection for transformants of interest can be done, but also because the fusion protein itself might have some intrinsic useful properties. For example, Bt2 NPTII fusion proteins might be more stable in plant cells than intact Bt2 protein and or the messenger RNA derived from the fusion genes might be more stable than intact Bt2 RNA. A substantial fraction of the plants transformed with the transformation vectors described herein will contain, stably inserted into their genome, a fragment of newly acquired DNA containing both a chimeric Bt toxin gene and a marker gene nos, NPTII . This was confirmed by the results of southern blotting experiments. The new phenotypic traits acquired through this transformation method expression of Bt Toxin, antibiotic resistance, nopaline production will be inherited according to classic Mendelian genetics. To verify stable inheritance of the new traits, F₁ descendants from transformed plants were analysed for the expression of Bt toxin and synthesis of nopaline. Transformed tobacco plants were allowed to flower and give seed. Cure was taken that no cross pollination occured. From 4 plants previously identified as Bt 161 9, 10 ¹, 147 ⁸, 174 , seeds were germinated in agar medium and F₁ plants were analysed for the presence of nopaline nopaline synthase being present as marker gene in the parental plants . Plants were tested 3 weeks after germination approximately 1 cm in height or later at 6 7 weeks 2 4 cm . The results are depicted in Table 18. From plants 10 1 and 147 8 about 3 4 of the F₁ were nos , which is expected from Mendelian inheritance of a single locus 1 2 1 . For F₁ plants from 161 9, the nopaline signal was very weak when plantlets were tested at approximately 3 weeks after germination. Due to this weak expression the nopaline signals were not clearly visible and therefore the number of positives might be underestimated at this stage. However at 7 weeks a clear positive signal was detected in a 3 4 of the plants. The reason for the low expression in the early age of the plants is not known. In the F₁ from plant 174, of the 45 plants analysed, 43 were nos . This high percentage 95 of no s indicates that the nos gene is inserted in the genome on more than one independent locus. F₁ plants were also analysed for the expression of Bt2 toxin using the ELISA. Data from ELISA assays on leaf tissue indicated that Bt2 phenotype was correlated with nos . Therefore the Bt2 trait is stably inherited.
