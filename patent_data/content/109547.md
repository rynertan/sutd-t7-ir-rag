# Method of applying a coating to heat sensitive materials.

## Abstract
A method and means for drying a thin aqueous based coating on heat sensitive materials without boiling and without distortion or damage to the heat sensitive material or delicate surface thereof. Solvent based adhesives are used in the production of articles of manufacture because of the ability to assemble the separate pieces immediately after the spray adhesive is applied. However, certain solvent based adhesives attack the surface of the item to be covered, and in the case of videodiscs, the solvent in the adhesive may well contaminate the plastic surfaces or even the aluminum reflective layer of a laser disc. According to the present invention, a water based coating applied to a sensitive material is subjected to alternate sources of radiant heat energy and relatively cool air. The time of exposure to each source and the amounts of heating and cooling of the respective sources are maintained at levels sufficient to significantly decrease the time needed to dry the coating while limiting the temperature increase of the material to a level insufficient to deform or distort the material or surfaces thereof.
