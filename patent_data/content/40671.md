# Drive apparatus.

## Abstract
Drive apparatus especially useful for controllably displacing the carrier of a printer, the drive apparatus including a lead screw 25 having laterally spaced apart and floating threaded followers 35, 36 thereon. Inter mediate the threaded followers 35, 36 are a first pair of preloaded springs 50 which press the followers 35, 36 against the opposite flanks of the threads on the lead screw 25 to thereby inhibit backlash intermediate the followers 35, 36 . A second pair of springs 70 are mounted inter mediate a bracket 30 , which is fastened to the carrier, and at least one of the followers for effecting coupling be tween the carrier and the follower while controlling backlash therebetween. A pair of arms 37a, 38a extend from the followers 35, 36 and are coupled to a restraining shaft 100 in such a manner as to inhibit rotational movement of the arms 37, 38 and thus the followers while per mitting motion of the followers in the direction parallel and perpendicular to the lead screw 25 to accommodate runnout or eccentricity.
