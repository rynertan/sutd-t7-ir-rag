# IMMOBILISATION SUPPORTS FOR CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL PROCESSES AND METHODS OF THEIR MANUFACTURE

## Abstract
New immobilisation supports for use in physical and chemical processes are produced from bird, animal or fish bone by cleaning the bone of all tissue and finely dividing it to an appropriate particle size. Bone consists of a mineral matrix of calcium phosphate with organic connective collagen tissue material, principally the protein oseine, uniformly distributed therethrough. The oseine provides an ideal distributed site for the chemical attachment of bacteria, cells and organic enzyme catalysts, so that they are securely immobilised. It also con stitutes a suitable medium, for example, for affinity chromato graphy in which complex molecules, such as antigens, form specific couples with support materials from which they can be washed out and decoupled for assay. The attachment may be by absorbtion, or by charge attraction, or may require a cross linking agent attachable between the oseine and the supported material. The particular material to be attached may require the use of a chelating agent or a buffering agent to shield it from the action of the ionic calcium of the bone. A particularly economical source for the bone is the boney frac tion obtained from the mechanical separation of meat and bone that is employed to recover meat from otherwise waste product, e.g. chicken necks and backs unwanted by the chicken fast food industry. Chicken bone is more porous than animal bone and thus particularly suitable for the purpose.
