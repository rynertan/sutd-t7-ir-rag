# OPTICAL BEAM ANALYZER

## Abstract
A system for analyzing the characteristics of a light beam is disclosed. Functionally, the system includes an optical sys tem for collecting the light beam to be analyzed. An array of light sensitive elements is positioned at the focal plane of the optical system. A digital system sequentially samples the out put signals of the light sensors and processes the resulting data to generate signals indicative of the characteristics of the light beam.
