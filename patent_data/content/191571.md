# Alternator regulator protection circuit.

## Abstract
The circuit prevents damage to the regulator 24 or to the battery 12 of an automotive ignition system due to the igni tion being turned on but the engine alternator not rotating. A fixed duty cycle control signal is added to the control signal for the excitation current only when non rotation is detected, thus limiting battery drain and excessive temperature in the regulator module.
