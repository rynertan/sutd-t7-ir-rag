## Description
ANALOG FADING MEMORYBACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to infrared imagers. It is highly desirable to have an infrared area array imager which will provide a detailed image at wavelengths own to the limits of the available long wavelength atmospheric window, i.e. at wavelengths of 8 12 microns. The detection of such long wavelengths, if it is to be done at moderate cryogenic temperatures e.g. at liquid nitroqen rather than liquid helium tem eratures , is preferably done sing a very narrow bandgap semiconductor, such as CdxTe. Such alloys, where x ranges from 0 to 1 inclusive, are referred to generically herein as HgCdTe . This seudo binary allov, if it has a composition such as x .2, wiRl have a handgap small enouah 0.1 ev to be bridged by 12 micron photons Conventional approaches using HgCdTe area arrays have tvpicallv used HgCdTe photodiodes as optical detectors, and have interconnected these photodiodes with silicon processing stages. A difficulty in long wavelength imaqing is that the background flux is verv high. That is, the peak black bodv wavelength at rnom temperature is very close to 12 microns, so that stray near field long wavelength radiation is likely to be generated by the infrared imaging optics of the imaging system. Moreover, verv little of a field of view wil usuallv be trulv dark. That is, in thermal imaging the brightness variation within an image will be due to typicallv small variation in temperature and to variation in the black bodv coefficients. These effects produce a dynamic range within a scene which is relatively small. Little of the photon flux carries information since most of the flux merelv corresponds to the high average temperature of the scene.This is frequentlv handled, in conventional long wavelength imaging systems by a skimming operation in which the signal from each pixel is thresholded to eliminate the effect of the background flux. However, this thresholding operation does not improve the signal to noise ratio, and may worsen it, since the noise component due to fluctuation in the background flux remains. hus it is an object of the present invention to provide a long wavelength detector which provides a very good siqnal to noise ratio, even in the face of substantial long wavelength background flus. The nresent invention teaches an MIS detector. An infrared imager, wherein the signal sensed is repeatedly averaged in a capacitor. The output of the imager is thus sensed as an exponential average over a large number of read cycles, which provides a qreatly improved signal to noise ratio. Recursive averaging is thus optinally accomplished without a large software load. The circuit which performs this analog Processing is very simple. According to the present invention there is provided A memory comprising a first capacitor sampling switch means, connected to said first capacitor, for eriodicallv setting the voltage on said first capacitor in accordance with an input signal a second capacitor averaging switch means, connected to said first and second capacitors, for periodically equalizing the voltages on saiH first and second capacitors means for providing the voltage on said second capacitor as an output whereaby said output provides a voltage corresponding to a exponential average of inputs sucessivelv applied through said sampling switch to said first capacitors.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The present invention will first be discussed with referencing to a whole family of embodiments using a hybrid structure, wherein the averaging capacitor sites are vertically interrated with the detector sites. Next, an additional range of embodiments, wherein the averaging sites are physically separated from the detector sites will be discussed. The entire imager chip of the present invention is generally shown in FIGURE 6. In the center is shown a HgCdTe area 106, which contains, in this embodiment, a 32. X 32 array 56 of detector sites 50. Directly heneath each HgCdTe detector site 50 is a silicon averaging capacitor site 54. The sequence of signals read from each HgCdTe detector site 50 is recursivelv averaged in its corresponding silicon averaging capacitor site 54, and the output from the silicon averaging capacitor is then provided to one of the output circuits shown on the left and right sides of the drawing. The fabrication and structure of the HgCdTe detector sites 50 will first be described. The preferred architecture of the silicon underneath the HgCdTe, and the preferred operation of the array, will be described subsequently. A plan view of the presently preferred embodiment each of of the HgCdTe detector sites is shown in FIGURE 2. With the geometrics shown, about 35 of the total area is optically accumulative, and about 558 of the total stores charge. TheHgCdTe substrate 106 comprises long wavelength material, e.g. HG.gCd 2Te. A storage gate 14 of semi transoarent metal e.g. nickel or chromium is provided for each pixel. Note that the storage gates for adjacent pixels are separate, and there is no electrical contact whatsoever between adjacent pixels in the HqCdTe. The storage gate 14 is preferably thin, e.g. 100 anqstroms, to promote transparency. This storage gate overlies an insulator 15, such as zinc sulphide. A main via 16 connects the HgCdTe sensor portion to the corresponding silicon averaging capacitor site. In order to make contact to the extremely thin storage gate, a via stop 18 is placed on the storage gate, and a metal film interconnect e.g. 1 micron of indium is used to connect the via stop 18 to the contact 22 on the silicon at the bottom of the via. The formation of this device structure will now be described. Massive amounts of processing detail are included, to provide a fully enabling description of the invention, but these processing details do not define limitations of the invention. First, a monocrystalline HgCdTe slice is lapped to be parallel. At least one side is polished smooth, using one half percent bromine in methanol. The polished side is anodically oxidized to about 700 angstroms of oxide 58 in potassium hydroxide, using, e.g. 300 microamps current for CdHgTe slice measuring about 0.2 X 0.9 inches. Preferably the HgCdTe used is n type, with a carrier concentration of 5E14 per cubic cm. Of course, lower carrier concentrations could be used. Next, the HgCdTe is mounted on the silicon processors.For convenience, the HgCdTe mounting is preferablv done before the silicon wafer has been completely diced up into chips, so that a HqCdTe bar can be mounted to, e.g., 4 scribed silicon chips simultaneously, before the chips are actually separated.The silicon substrates chips or groups of chips are preferably flat, and must he cleaned thoroughlv on both sides. W.ach siIicon substrate is heated to a controlled temperature of lOOC, and a very low viscosity and low surface tension glue 60 is then applied to the center detector pattern i.e. to the averaging capacitor area on each of the silicon chips on the silicon bar. The HgCdTe bar is then placed on the silicon substrate, oxide down. The alignment marks in the silicon are used to obtain rough alignment of the H9Cdve bar at this time.A press is used to hold the HgCdTe in place while the glue sets, using, e.g., three to four ounces of pressure over the 3 X 32 array. The gluing step is required to produce a thin and uniform glue bond, and a low viscosity epoxy glue such asEpotek 301 is preferably used. After the gluing operation, the excess HgCdTe which hangs over the edges of the silicon bar is then scribed and broken off. The silicon substrate, having the HqCdTe bar glued to it, is now waxed to a glass lapping plug. These plugs are commercially available parts, formed, e.g., as cylinders one inch in diameter and 1 3 4 inches tall, having flat and parallel ends. The flatness of the substrate on the lapping plug is preferably within two microns. If it is not flat within two microns, the waxing step is preferably performed over. The thinning steps can then begin. Preferably the alignment marks on the silicon are protected, e.g. by painting them with resist and curing, prior to the fitting operation.The remainder of the silicon processor bar should he adequatelv protected by its thick preferably one micron nitride protective overcoat. It may also be desirable to protect the contact pads on the silicon bar during the polishing step.Alternatively, exposed resist is applied over the whole structure prior to polishing. The resist on the HgCdTe will be polished off. The HgCdTe is then lapped, e.g. with three micron grit on glass down to about 75 microns thick, followed by lapping with 0.3 micron grit on a polishing cloth e.g., Buehler Texmet TM until the scratches left from the three micron lap are gone. The HgCdTe is then polished, with half percent bromine meth nol on a peilon pad, down to 20 to 25 microns. A final polishing step, using one eighth percent bromine methanol solution, takes the Mgcdve down to L9 microns above the silicon surface. The silicon substrate is then wax mounted to a silicon secondary substrate, which is used simply as a carrier for processing. Alternatively, sapphire or other rigid material can be used for this carrier. At this point, the structure in hand is a long thinned strip of HgCdTe, g ued across several connected Si chips. The first patterning step is now performed, to reduce the area 106 required for the imaging array 6 on each chip. In addition, a small strip of HgCdTe is also preferably left in place connecting each of the arrays together. This provides electrical connection between the HgCdTe areas, and is useful to pass current during anodic oxidation. It will be removed later during processing. Preferably this step is done, e.g. by spinning on a resist such as l80CP available from Hunt at 4,000 RPM for 20 seconds. The resist is dried for three minutes at 60 C, exposed, developed for thirty seconds, rinsed for 15 seconds, and ashed at 200 watts for 30 seconds. At this point, it is again desirable to apply special protection to any exposed aluminum, such as the alignment marks, since aluminum is attacked by bromine methanol. A spray etch with fresh 1 88 bromine methanol is then applied until the pattern clears, i.e.until the separation trenches have etched down to the epoxy.The remaining thin epoxy is then ashed off on a plasma asher, and the photoresist is then removed. The second patterning step patterns the via 16 through the HgCdTe. This is a crucial step, since the via 16 geometry must satisfy several constraints. If the via 16 is etched too small, the device can short out at the bottom of the via. If the via is etched too large, so that it intrudes into the active area of the device, the dark current will be qreatly increased. Third, the walls of the via 16 must be very smooth to provide good step coverage. For example, simple ion milling leaves rough walls. Thus, the presently preferred embodiment uses ion milling to make a small via hoZe e.g. 0.4 mils , then uses spray etching to enlarge the via to get to the right diameter. After the resist is patterned, the ion milling is preferably done with argon ions, using e.g., 600 milliamps beam current at 600 volts at about 1 4 micron of pressure. The stage is preferably angled ten degrees to the beam and is rotated. This stage must be cooled. In the presently preferred embodiment the stage is cooled to about 5 C during milling. Preferably the ion milling is performed intermittently, to assure that the device does not heat up locally. Heating is most undesirable because the dis sociation of HgCdTe occurs at relatively low temperatures.Such dissociation can alter the bandgap, degrade interface stability, increase the carrier concentration, or have other undesirable effects. After ion milling has cut all the way through the HgCdTe, the device, with its photoresist still intact, is spray etched in fresh 1 8 bromine methanol in ten second stages until the via has been undercut to a total diameter of in the presently preferred embodiment 0.7 mils.After the photoresist is removed, the whole device is then static etched in one eighth percent bromine methanol for fifteen seconds, to remove any damaged layer which may have been generated during the ion milling step. The next step is growth of an anodic oxide layer 62 on the HgCdTe. After a preliminary ashing step for cleanup, oxide is grown to first blue around 700 angstroms thickness in potassium hydroxide, using a current of, e.g., 23 microamps for a device substrate. This provides a mixture of cadmium oxides, Te oxides, and tellurites. This layer plus the zinc sulfide layer 15 form the insulator of the MIS capacitor.Resist is now patterned to define the areas where the first zinc sulfide layer 15 is to be deposited. The zinc sulfide is deposited everywhere except on the silicon. Preferably 2500 angstroms of zinc sulfide is deposited by evaporation off axis e.g. 30 degrees off axis onto a rotating table. The zinc sulfide lifted off, e.g by immersion and spray in tetrachloroethyl ene. ZnS over anodic oxide is the preferred insulator, but many others preferably of high permittivity can be used, e.g. Nub205, Ta205, Ti02, Ti02 Al203 composites, etc. The transparent MIS gate 14 can now be deposited. A thin resist layer e.g. 4000 or 5000 angstroms is formed over areas outside of the storage gate 14. A short ion milling step is applied for adhesion before the gate is actually deposited. One hundred twenty five angstroms of nickel is then deposited, and lifted off from undesired areas. The via stop 18 is then formed, again by lift off.Preferably 800 angstroms of aluminum are used. Again, an adhesion milling step is preferably used before the metal is deposited. A second zinc sulfide layer 64 is then deposited in the same locations as the first zinc sulfide layer. Preferably 9000 angstroms are deposited in the second layer. Preferably in adhesion milling step is used before the zinc sulfide is deposited. Again, the zinc sulfide is patterned by liftoff. Next, the MIS via 66 is cut. This will cut the opening for connection of the metal interconnect 20 to the via stop 18 on the storage gate 14. This is preferably done using a 1 8 bromine methanol wet etch. Next, the substrate via is preferably cut. The substrate via is not shown in FIGURE 2, but provides the bias connection for the HgCdTe barlog, and thus for the MIS capacitor. preferably the HgCdTe bar is biased at about 5V with respect to the silicon substrate. This etch is preferably done using 1 8 bromine methanol. The main via 16 is then opened again, using the same mask as in the original via etch step the second mask . In this case, a 1 8 bromine methanol etch is preferably used. This etch is used to open up contact to the aluminum bond pads 22 in the underlying silicon, as shown in FIGURE 1. Note that, at the bottom of via 16, a substantial width of the first insulator layer 15, 14 and the second insulator layer 64 separates theHgCdTe substrate 106 from the interconnect 20 and band pad 22.This is due to the overetch applied during initial cutting of the via 16. One effect of the anodic oxidation process which is used in the presently pereferred embodiment as described above is that a substantial amount of positive trapped charge remains in the oxide. This is actually advantageous, since this trapped charge in effect acts as a channel stop. That is, outside of the region covered by the MIS storage gate 14, a space charge of electrons will be found at the surface of the HgCdTe material 106. Thus, the well created underneath the storage gate, using n type HgCdTe as in the presently preferred embodiment, will collect substantially only photo generated holes, which provide the desired signal. However, an alternative embodiment of the present invention uses p type rather than n type HgCdTe material, again at a carrier concentration of, e.g., 5E14 per cubic centimeter although the actual carrier concentration may, in p type as in n type embodiments, be anywhere from 5El6 down to of.13 or less . In this case, positive trapped charge in the oxide does not have a channel stop effect, but has precisely the opposite effect. That is, the space charge of electrons which is found all over the surface of the HgCdTe 106 will immediately flow into the depletion wells underneath the storage gates 14, swamping the desired signal provided by photoelectrons.Thus, in the embodiment of the present invention which uses p type material and anodic oxide, one additional masking step is used to deposit a field plate over the whole surface of the HgCdTe except for the storage gates 4 are found. The mask used for the field plate is preferably the complement of the mask used for the MIS gates 4, or is slightly larger. That is, a small degree of overlap can be provided between the field plate and the storage gates 14. Note that use of the field plate is not restricted to embodiments using p type material, but can also be used in many other embodiments, and, in particular, desirable in any embodiment where the insulating laver does not contain a sufficient amount of trapped charge of the proper sign. Figure 15 shows an embodiment using a field plate 70. A further embodiment of the present invention, in which bump bonding rather than via connections is used to connect the narrow bandgap semiconductor to the silicon substrate, is shown in Figures 4 and 5. In this embodiment, there is still exactly one averaging capacitor sight located in the silicon underneath each detector sight in the HgCdTe, but bump bonding is used rather than via methods to form a connection. That is, as shown in Figure 5, each storage gate 14 would be connected through a bonding strap 108 to a tall indium post 104. The respective indium posts 104 are then pressed onto a pattern of the contact pads 22 on the silicon, and, preferably with slight heat applied to assist fusion, the indium posts 104 are cold welded onto the contact pads in the substrate. A low viscocity epoxv glue is preferablv used to fill the void in the remaining spaces above the substrate. In this case, since no via needs to be formed, thinning of the HgCdTe is removed from the constraint imposed by via geometry. However, since in this configuration the collection is at the backside and not at the exposed surface of the device, it is desirable to thin theHgCdTe so that location where the photo carriers are generated will not be too far away from the collection sights. Although the diffusion length of carriers in HgCdTe is normally extremely long, collection is still most efficient when the location where photogeneration of the carriers occurs is not too far removed from the location where collection occurs. Alternatively, this structure can be fabricated epitaxially. That is, using a cadmium telluride CdTe substrate, a thin epitaxial layer of HgCdTe is used for the active device structure. Where bump bonding is used to connect such a structure, the CdTe substrate can be as thick as is desirable for mechanical handling properties, since CdTe is transparent to wavelengths from about 1 micron to about 30 microns. In a further embodiment of the invention, a photodiode structure rather than an MIS capacitor can be used as the detector sight. That is, a device structure such as shown inFigure 16 would be used at the HgCdTe level. In this case, the material used is preferably p type material having a carrier concentration of, e.g., lie15 per cubic centimeter. Atop this p type material 112 would be formed an n type layer 114, which is preferably less than 1 micron thick again, it is desirable to have the sight of photogeneratin of carriers be close to or coincident with the sight of their collection. Even long wavelength photons are normally absorbed in a semiconductor very close to the surface, e.g. within F micron. This structure can be formed, for example, after the HgCdTe material has been bonded to the silicon and thinned as described above, by cutting the via hole 16 down to the aluminum contact patterns 22 and silicon s described before. At this point processing diverges. To form the n type layer 114, almost any species of ion can be implanted, since the implant damage, rather than the particular species implanted, tends strongly to produce n type material in HgCdTe. Thus, a species which is not a dangerous impurity in silicon is preferably implanted, and the species implanted need not even be a dopant impurity in HgCdTe. For example, argon ions can be implanted to produce n type layer 114.Since this is done after the via hole has been patterned, the walls of the via hole 16 are also implanted, so that formation of an ohmic contact from the n type layer 114 to the contact pad 22 on the silicon can be very easily performed, simply by depositing a small amount of metal 118 such as indium over nickel at the bottom of the via hole l6. Of course, it is preferable to use metals which are not as dangerous to silicon as nickel The same mask which is used to cut the via hole 16 can be used to pattern the metal 118.Since it is very easy to form ohmic contacts to HgCdTe, and particularly n type HgCdTe, the choice of the metal 118 is very easy. To achieve channel stops, preferably the HgCdTe is etched away to form mesas 120, as shown in Figure 17. Again, it is necessary to have some ground connection for the p type EgCdTe substrate. An alternative way of connecting the n tvpe regions 114 to the aluminum pad 22 on the silicon is through a via which is not located within the active device mesa 120, but is adjacent to it, as shown by the vias 122 in Figure 17. In operation of a photodiode embodiment of the present invention, the chief difference is that, in effect, the photodetector site represents a depletion capacitance, instead of the series combination of a depletion capacitance with anMIS gate insulator. Thus, the general mode of operation of the photodiode embodiment is fairly similar to that of the MIS embodiment.That is, a bias voltage is applied to the photodiode which opens up a wide depletion region at the junction boundary. As photocarriers are generated, this depletion region will be rwrr wed, thus modifying the capacitance. If the capacitance is sampled after a fixed time interval, its value wi1.7 indicate the photon flux received. Thus, in operation, a bias voltage vb is first applied to both the photodiode and the averaging capacitor Ch. After the photodiode has had time to collect flux, it is connected toCb for integration, and then isolated and biased to begin another collection period. It should be noted that this mode of operation is substantially different from the mode of operation used in the prior art of photodiode device. That is, the prior art applies a constant bias to a photodiode, and often includes much complicated circuitry to achieve the constant bias. In effect, the prior art senses changes in current caused bv changes in flux, and the bias voltage is therefore carefully selected to achieve a locally maximum value of the derivative of current with respect to flux. By contrast, in this embodiment of the present invention the key criterion for sensitivity is the partial derivative of capacitance with respect to flux, across the band of voltages to which the photodiode is exposed during its integration time.That is, as flux generates Photocarrier in the photodiode, the width of the depletion region will gradually narrow, and therefore the capacitance across the dioie will increase and the voltage will decrease. In this embodiment, the maximum flux collection time in the photodiode is limited not merely by the considerations of number of integrate cycles per read cycle and the desired timing of the read cycles, as discussed above with reference to the principle preferred embodiment, but is also limited by the self debiasing behavior of the photodiode as discussed above. Finally, the metal interconnects 20 are patterned. Preferably these two are patterned bv liftoff. Preferably a double adhesion mill is performed and 100 angstroms of nickel is deposited first, and then about 1 microns of indium are deposited using angle sputtering . At this stage also are formed the ground connection for the HqCdTe bar 10s, through the substrate via. The architecture of the respective silicon averaging capacitor sites 54 which underlie each MIS detector site so will now briefly be described. As shown in Figure 3, the bond pad area 22 within the metallization layer 68 is defined by the absence of the protective nitride overcoat, which otherwise protects all of the silicon chip. Bond pad 22 is aligned with via 16 in the CdHgTe cell overhead, so that the metal interconnect 20 connects bond pad 22 to storage gate 14. The metal bond pad 22 is connected to a moat 36 at contact 42, and transistors 38 and 40 provide selective connection to the bond pad. When the clock line phii 28 is raised, the bond pad 22 is connected to the bottom plate 32 of the poly to poly capacitor 30.The poly to poly capacitor 30 has a capacitance which is typically at least comparable to storage gate 14, and thus, when transistor 38 is activated, the signal which has been generated between storage gate 14 and the CdHgTe substrate can be averaged with the signal which has been stored in capacitor 30, as will be discussed below. The transistor 40 is controlled by another clock line phimux, and this transistor selectively connects the bond pad 22 and therefore the storage gate 14 to a read line 24.Thus, to accumulate the wells and reset the storage gate for a new integration time, the read line 24 is used to apply these two signals to all cells. Similarly, when the recursively averaged signal stored in capacitor 30 is to be read out, both lines phii and phimux are raised, to connect bottom plate 32 to word line 24. The fabrication of the silicon is preferably done using a 3 micron double poly MOS process, which is standard except in one point the dielectric of capacitor 30 is preferably formed as an oxide nitride oxide composite. This particular composite dielectric provides a precisely controlled high specific capacitance together with a low defect density.Briefly, an oxide is formed over first poly either grown or deposited , nitride is partially oxidized at the same time as the second gate oxide is grown. This process is described in greater detail in U.S. Patent Application 468,420 TI 9335 , which is hereby incorporated by reference. The operation of this imager will now be described in somewhat greater detail, to provide more explanation of the noise reduction advantages gained. FIGURE 1.2 shows a hypothetical schematic which wil be used to discuss the effect of recursive averaging. The switches Si and S2 are opened alternately, with no overlap. The output voltage will be referred to as a time series Xn, and the input voltage will be referred to as a time series Yn. When switchS2 is closed, the output voltage Xn equals a weighted average of the previous output voltage with the current input voltage VOUt Xn alpha Xn 1 1 alpha Yn, where alpha is a factor which is defined as EMI17.1 In the low frequency limit, Xn is equal to Yn EMI17.2 For variances associated with Ynr i.e. for noise which is due to noise contained in the input signal,EMI17.3 The signal to noise ratio is thenEMI17.4 Thus, recursive filtering enhances the signal to noise ratio by an amount which depends on the factor alpha, i.e. on the ratio of the input capacitor Ca to the averaging capacitor b. Ca in this example corresponds generally to the MIS capacitor defined by the gate 14, and Cb corresponds generally to the averaging capacitor 30 which is located in the silicon. That is, the recursive averaging can substantially reduce the noise power which is due to the background flux. FIGURE 9 shows the layout and timing of a first simplified embodiment of the present invention. Note that the vias shown at every pixel location connect vertically to theHgCdTe MIS detector site which is not shown. This simplified embodiment depicts only a 3 X 3 array, but much larger array sizes are preferable, and array sizes of 128 X 128 and larger are expected to be the best mode of practicing the present invention in the future. In this simplified embodiment, the M1 switches are used both to reset the MIS array and to multiplex the signals during readout. The M2 switches perform the recursive integration onto the silicon averaging capacitors.In this embodiment, the phii Phiintegrate signals are operated in unison for all pixels in order to simplifv clocking. Separate voltages are supplied for resetting the read line Vr and for emptying the MIS wells Ve . A typical clocking sequence for such an array is as follows 1 Ve is impressed onto all MIS capacitors via transistor ME and all transistors Ml. This collapses all wells, and the storage charge is recombined. 2 Vr is impressed onto all MIS capacitors via transistor MR and all transistors Ml. This allows optically generated charge to collect in all of the MIS wells.Next, all of the lines Phimux which are also designated in various drawings as phim2r whim3, etc. are turned off, and all wells continue to collect signal charge.This sequence of steps is repeated until it is desired to begin readout operations. That is, each pixel site can go through a number of collect and integrate cycles at a verv high duty cycle before a readout cvcle for the array is begun. When readout begins, the row that is to be addressed is addressed through the approporiate transistor Ml. This should be done after an integrate phase, to gain advantage of the noise reduction effects of recursive filtering as discussed above. In an alternative embodiment, the well of a row being read can be collapsed. That is, if the wells are not collapsed before readout, the incident flux will be changing the voltage across the MIS. capacitor, and therefore the output voltage, while the read operation is in progress. It is conceivably possible that, under some flux conditions, such a changing output signal might trigger an instability in some sense amplifier design. However, this mode of operation is believed not to be a necessary precaution in the preferred embodiment. After the preamplifiers, the preferred additional circuitry uses a correlated double sampler. This correlated double sampler is clamped just after the reset voltage has been applied, and is released before the row ine is activated.After the read output has been provided to the read line, the second sample is taken. The signal information is found by comparison of the empty well potential which is equal to Vr and the actual potential which is right out from a particular storage gate 14. The timing chart of FIGURE 33 shows the timing of the read operation in slightly more detail. In this simplified electronically scanned mode of operation of the invention, the duty cycle and sensitivity are not optimal, but explanation of this embodiment will clarify the operation of the preferred recursive read mode of operation which will be described next.Note that the signal which appears on any one row line Phin is the logical sum of a common row line signal phiCom with a component phetan which is peculiar to that row line. At event number 1, which is the start of the nth cycle, all detector elements are first reset to Ver which puts them in accumulation. Next, the thetan signal selects the nth row. All detectors are connected to their respective integration capacitors 30 by a phii signal. After the rise of both thetan and therefore phin and phii, the nth detector s capacitor 14 and the nth averaging capacitor 30 Cb are both reset to Vr. The reset voltage Vr is chosen so that the storage capacitor 14 will be depleted. During event 3, photogenerated carriers are collected in the nth row detector. At event 4, the collected charge in the nth row detector is sensed. The output signal is the difference between the detector voltage at the end of event 2, which is the emptv well potential Vr, and the detector voltage at event 4. The recursive read operation, which is the presently preferred embodiment, will now be described in more detail, with reference to an embodiment in which the averaging capacitor 30 has a capacitance which is at least twice that of t he MIS capacitor. This translates to a value of 2 3 for the parameter alpha, and a maximum signal to noise improvement of the square root of 5. For best use of recursive filtering, the number of rows which needs to be integrated during each active integrating time is at least one plus alpha over 1 minus alpha, or in this case five rows. After a row has been read, it can be left idle until it can usefully begin collect and integrate cycles preparatory to the next read phase.That is, in this embodiment the row which has just been read remains in standby accumulation until five integration periods before that row is next to be read again. It would be possible to put a row through more collect and integrate cvcles before each read than strictly necessary, or even to keep all rows not being read in collect and integrate cycles, but this not preferred, due to the substantial additional load on the peripheral circuits. The varied steps in the recursive read process wil now be described with reference to the timing chart in FIGURE 14. At event l, all detectors are reset in accumulation, to empty all wells. This is done while the detectors are isolated from their respective integration capacitors 30, via open phii switches. At event 2, all detectors other than rows N throughN 4 are disconnected from the read line. Detectors N throughN 4 are reset to Vr, via signals phir and thetan through thetan 4. Again each row line signal phin is defined as Phicom theta n Thus the photo capacitors in rows N through N 4 are biased in depletion, where they are free to collect optically generated charge. At event 3, detector N remains addressed through signal thetaN, while rows N 1 through N 4 are isolated from the read line.After N 1 throughN 4 have been isolated from the read line, signal phii connects all capacitors 30 to their respective detectors 14.Those that are connected to active detectors again recursively integrate the latest photo generated signal with the stored averaged signal. The cells in which this Phii clock connects storage capacitors to inactive detectors i.e. to detectors in accumulation , eventually seek Ve. At event 4, charge continues to collect and integrate until the MIS detector is reset to Vr by the clock phase phir. Note that, in two rows, the integration capacitors 30 are reset to the reset voltage xJr. The capacitor in row N 5 is reset to Vr to initialize it for recursive integration of further signals. The integration capacitor in row N is also reset to Vr at this point, but that is unimportant and optional. The output signal is again defined by the difference between full and empty well potentials. A five frame recursive average of the nth row is found on the read line just prior to the phir clock at event 4. Several more cycles of timing are illustrated to show the standby integrate and readout progression throughout the array. Figure 11 shows a sample preamplifier circuit, used to amplify the signal from one detector pixel. Mg is used to isolate preamp from detector array during Det. probe. M1 and M2 are source followers. M2 and M4 are enhancement inverting gain stages. Capacitor C bandlimits the system. M5 and M6 are output buffer source followers. Vb biases M3 M6 as current sources. It should be noted that the present invention can tolerate low quality HgCdTe device material, since it is less sensitive to the noise figure degradation of dark currents than most prior art devices are. For example, the present invention can be embodied using HgCdve having intrinsic carrier concentrations of 5X 014 or higher, although this is not preferred. That is, as is well known in the art, there are a number of parameters which can be traded off in optimizing an infrared imager for a particular application. These include sensitivity, duty cycle, data rate, and array size. An example of the calculated performance of an MIS imaging array according to the present invention will now be discussed, to indicate the resulting performance. Suppose that the HgCdTe device aualitv is such that a 1500 angstroms zinc sulphide MIS gate can sustain a voltage differential of V Vth of 1 volt, and a 3000 angstrom layer of zinc sulphide can withstand 2 volts.Assume dark current to be 300 microamps per square centimeter for the storage area. This generally corresponds to HgCdTe having a intrinsic carrier concentration in the neighborhood of 5El4. Assume that the 8 10 micron spectral band is received. Assume that the processor input preferred noise specification is set at 10 microvolts, and that the load capacitance added bv the silicon input circuit is 2 picofarads. Assume that the net transmission through the optics is 0.7, and that the maximum flux in the focal Plane assuming a 3500 K farfield seen through f 3.2 optics having 8 focal length is 1.6 E6 photons per centimeter squared per second. It should also be noted that the dielectric constant of zinc sulphide is 8.R. From these data, the performances calculated as follows the load capacitance is 9.3 picofarads at the pixel. thus, the pixel integration time must be 12 microseconds. The fullweli. charge capacity is 3.3E6 carriers.The duty cycle is 9.2 , assuming currently used frame rates typical of a 64x64 infrared area imager. The sensitivity is then 538 microvolts per degree centigrade at the pixel site, and 237 microvolts per degree C at the output node. The noise at the read node is calculated as 14 microvolts, and the noise equivalent temperature figure for 1 frame is 0.0590 C. The system equivalent noise temperature at a 60 Hz framerate is then 0.0170C. This provides a substantially improved svstem noise equivalent temperature, which permits various other parameters to be separatelv pushed as follows the maximum data rate on one silicon column is equal to the length of the arrav, divided by the number of recursive integration times plus 1, divided by the integration time.If 9 recursive integrations are used, the integration time is 12 microseconds, and each column contains 64 pixels, then the maximum data rate is seen to be 530 kHz. Maximum system sensitivity can be acquired by summing frames for a relatively long period of time, e.g. 5 msecs.That is, one frame can be read in N 1 ti ta , where N is the number of recursive integration cycles, and ti and ta are the integration and addressing required times respectively. For example, if 9 recursive integrations are applied, and 12 microsecond integration is possible, and 4 microseconds are required for addressing, then one frame can be read in 160 microseconds. Therefore, in 16 msecs 100 frames can be read, and the system equivalent noise temperature is further improved by a factor of the square root of 100.This results in an estimated svstem equivalent noise temperature of 0.00590C, Thus the present invention advantageously provides an infrared area imager which will provide a detailed image at wavelengths down to the limits of the available atmospheric window, i.e. at wavelengths as long as about 12 microns. while there are advantages to having the averaging sites located directly underneath the detector sites in a hybrid structure, as discussed above, this configuration is not by any means necessary for practice of the present invention. That is, it is perfectly possible to take the raw detector signals from the infrared imager off chip and then feed those into a recursive averaging processor. Various forms of signal smoothing have been attempted in the prior art, to solve the noise problems of infrared images.The general principal behind these is that, when successive samples are summed together, if the initial sampling rate is much higher than the rate at which data changes in the scene, the signal corresponding to the scene will be summed directly and therefore will not be reduced by an averaging operation, whereas the noise will be summed in quadrature, and therefore will be reduced in expected value by approximately the square root of the number of samples being averaged together. Improving the signal to noise ratio of large data sets, particularly video information, is a desired effect. Most video integration systems use either a summation of successive frames an ideal discrete time integrator or a recursive integrator an exponential discrete time integrator . The ultimate result is that correlated video information is summed arithmetically and uncorrelated i.e., random video noise is summed in quadrature. The trade off is, of course, loss in dynamic scene response. That is, changing scenes tend to smear. Although this function is very simple conceptually, the large mass of data and often high data rates makes the implementation of the function very difficult. In order to perform the integration8, a memory location for each pixel is required. A multiply and add is, most often, also required for each pixel operation. These functions can be accomplished digitally. The analog video is digitized to the required resolution and the digital word describing each pixel is operated on successively to perform the integration. This invention performs the required integration recursively exponential integration in the analog domain. In doing such, the necessity of high speed analog to digital conversion is eliminated. In fact, if the integrated analog information needs to be digitized for another system related reason, the data rate can be reduced according to the degree of integration performed in the analog domain. Figure 12 shows a simplified schematic diagram of the recursive action of the memory cell. The continuous voltage and continuous time signal is sampled and held on Ca by SI.When S2 closes, the charge stored on Ca and Cb is shared. vhe resulting voltage after several cycles can be stated EMI25.1 where YN output XN a corresponding input, and alpha isMoreover,EMI25.2 where Y variance on YN associated with random noise.The signal to noise ratio improvement can be expressed EMI25.3 The steady state transfer converges to Y X t. This signal processing function is not unique. Some prior art systems have used recursive averaginq in software.However, this function requires many multiply steps, and ts very time consuming. What is unique about the present invention is that it offers a clever solution to the integration problem while offering a very low component count.In an integrated architecture Ca is a simple sample and hold capacitor. S1 is the sample switch. Cb would be an array of capacitors that would be commutated to Ca via the demultiplexing action of S2 one for each Cb . Another unique feature is the common input output of the memorv. Whenever the memory is updated, valid and most current data appears at theVout node. It should be noted that care has to be taken in design such that stray capacities associated with S2 and theInterconnects are accounted for. A solution to insure alpha being as designed is to make alpha externally adjustable. Such a scheme is shown in Figure 26.It should be clear that a Cb exists for each pixel however, since the video is usually serial in time from pixel to pixel, Ca can be time division multiplexed to the appropriate Cb, i.e., one Ca could run the whole NxM memory or, say, N Cas could run the NxM memory. In either event, Ca is repeated much fewer times than Ch. Therefore, it is feasible to make Ca adjustable by closing Sx and or By and or Sz. In doing such, the value of Ca can be trimmed to suit the requirement. This proposition holds true if one desires to make alpha adjustable for system related requirements. Fig. 19 shows a proposed architecture for implementing this invention. Two circuits as shown perform frame integration on the output from a 64 by 64 focal plane imager.In this application, the operating temperature is 770K. this benefits operation in that leakage currents drop to near zero and need not be considered during the design. Room temperature 300K or thermo cooled 200K operation are alternative embodiments, but increased leakage currents will result. This analog memory can easily be constructed using MOSLSI technology. The switches are simple MOS transistors while the capacitors are realized using two level polvsilicon parallel plates. This method of construction uses significantly less gate area than a comparable CCD structure. Unlike a CCD analog memory, it also is highly forgiving of processing tolerances.The processor was designed to operate with the 64x64 HgCdTe CID described in U.S. Patent 4,360,732, which is hereby incorporated by reference. However, this processor can also be used in conjunction with many other kinds of infrared imagers.The architecture consists of 32 channels of preamplification followed by individual correlated double samplers CDS and synchronous clamps. The outputs of the CDS and synchronous clamps each have buffers consisting of a source follower configuration. This is then followed by a 32x64 analog memorv array. This is followed hy a memory buffer and a multiplexer that has a common load. The output is multiplexed 32 1 so there is only one output video line. This output video is then buffered source follower and taken off chip. The architecture is shown in Figure 1. Thus the present invention advantageously provides a long wavelength detector which provides a very good signal to noise ratio, even in the face of substantial long wavelength background flux. The preamp Figure 20 used was of a cascode configuration. The design parameters are given in Table 1 below. Table 1 Cin 7.5 pF Av 25 BW 1.8 MHz Pd 0.65 mWAll devices in Pigure 20 are n channel enhancement mode transistors. The gain of the cascode is approximately equal to the square root of the W L ratios of the driver M1 and the load M3 . Since the voltage gain of M1 from gate to drain is about 2.3, the Miller multiplier is held to 3.3. This fact, along with the self aligned gate structure of M1, allowed low input capacitance to be achieved, for a standard 800 ANMOS process. M4 and MS form an output buffer Av approximately .9 for the gain stage. M6 is used to reset the read line. Cinj is the inject capacitor.The bandwidth of the amplifier is determined by the gm of the load transistor M3 and the rolloff capacitor, Crolloff. The correlated double sampler CDS is used to eliminateKTC Reset noise and output offsets. The CDS attenuates l f preamp noise, due to the zero at the origin w o in the CDS transfer function. Figure 21 is a schematic of the CDS.Clamp is the clamp capacitor and Cs h is the sample capacitor. M1 is the clamp switch, M2 is the sample switch, and M3 is the switch which sets the bias for the output buffer, consisting of M4 and M5. The tradeoffs here are 1 the attenuation of the signal through the voltage divider,Cclamp and Cs h 2 Cs h has to be sized such thatKTC noise is negligible compared to the preamp output noise. The synchronous clamp is shown in Figure 22. Its purpose is to remove column correlated offsets and to set the bias of its output buffer, comprised of transistors M2 and M3. The synchronous clamp operation degrades the SNR by a factor of root 2 i.e., the output noise out of the CDS is increased by 1.4. This extra noise can be virtually eliminated by bandlimiting the synchronous clamp. The analog memory uses switched capacitors to perform a first order recursive filter action on video samples. The ratio Cb Ca Cb determines the integration feedback coefficient, alpha. There are 64 memory locations in each of the 32 channels. The locations within each channel are addresed by a row and column address of an 8x8 matrix. Fiqure 73 shows one column of eight For an individual preamp channel.R1 through R8 as well as Cl through C8 are generated by on chin memory control logic. There are 2048 memory locations on the chip. The memory has a common input output line buss for each channel. The data stored in memory is an analog voltage in discrete time. The first order recursive filter improves SNR by a factor ofEMI29.1 where a is the integration feedback coefficient.The noise gain throuqh the memory is 1 a , while signal gain is 1. l a The memory output buffer serves two functions. TheS H circuit serves as a temporary analog memory that stores data thus the output data rate can be reduced. Secondly, Cd is used to take out effects due to Vt variations in Ml, shown in Figure 24, and also shifts the quiescent output of M6. M6 is the driver for the output multiplexer. The multiplexer, shown in Figure 25, is a common load type multiplexer, where M5 is the common load for all 32 channels. Video data, out of the memory output buffer, are commutated onto the gate of the output driver M10, by switchesM1, M2, M3, . . . , M3 . she switches are controlled by a two phase ratioless shift register. Phase 3 is used to reset the analog switches and to establish a reference for the output buffer. The Fading Memory Processor was manufactured using a modified NMOS process which consisted of a 600 angstrom gate oxide and a 400 angstrom interlevel oxide poly 1 poly 2 .It was necessary to use a 400 angstrom interlevel to achieve a suitable alpha integration feedback coefficient for a SNR improvement, in the analog memory, of approximately 2.25. The 600 angstrom gate oxide was used so that lXf noise in the cascode preamp driver could be reduced, i.e.,EMI30.1 where Cox is the gate oxide capacitance and tox is the thickness of the gate oxide. The results of 77 0K testing of one slice are shoen below in Table 2.

The power dissipation was excessive, being approximately 65 mW.Thus, VDD and VHI were reduced to 8 V to bring the power dissipation under the spec and goal parameters of 50 mW. The only loss In doing this was a decrease in input dynamic range 200 mV to 150 mV . Preamp Dynamic Range was designed for approximately 250 mV input referred . Because of the decrease in input dynamic range due to power dissipation requirements and the slightly larger preamp gain 29 as opposed to 25 , the input dynamic range was decreased to 150 mV. However, since the input referred noise was 6.5 uV, the preamp dynamic range approached the goal of 90 dB. Processor gain was slightly reduced, owing to the extra buffer Av approximately .9 needed in the Fading MemoryProcessor. It was mentioned earlier that for the device characterized, 400 angstrom interlevel oxide was grown. The ramifications of such a move, meant that all poly 1 poly 2 capacitors essentially doubled. This aided our efforts to achieve an alpha of approximately .7. However, it also meant that the preamp rolloff capacitor doubled and the bandwidth was cut in half. The advantage gained by the modified process is expected to outweigh any decrease in bandwidth. Inject transient recover y far exceeds specifications, thus indicating the bandwidth specification was not appropriate for noise performance. Initially, the total input capacitance was approximately 17 pF. It was determined that this capacitance was too large, so, in a further embodiment, the first poly mask was chanqed, making Cinj 4 pF for the 400 angstrom interlevel process. Processor noise was determined to be 6.5 uV RMS. This number was arrived at using a noise equivalent bandwidth of 1.26 MHz, Delta T time between clamp and sample 15 uS, and by bandlimiting the synchronous clamp VREF . This input referred noise can all he attributed to the preamplifier alone. The low noise was a result of decreasing the gate oxide thickness of the transistors to 600 angstrom, as opposed to 800 angstrom. Since the noise power should have decreased by a factor of 1.3. If Delta T is reduced to 3.5 uS, the correlated double sampler reduces the noise further, and the input referred noise becomes approximately 5.5 uV. Thus the present invention advantageously provides a long wavelenqth detector which provides a very good signal to noise, even in the face of substantial long wavelength background flux. As it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the present invention provides a major novelty in the art of infrared imagers. In view of the very broad novelty set forth in the present patent application, the present invention can be embodied in a wide variety of modifications and variations, and the present invention is not limited except as may be defined in the claims. All claims should be interpreted broadly, in accordance with the pioneering status of the present invention.
