# Water borne coating compositions containing metallic pigment having reduced tendency to gas generation on storage.

## Abstract
The tendency of metallic pigments, especially of alumi nium flake pigments, to react with the aqueous medium of a water borne paint composition with the generation of gaseous material is prevented or reduced by incorporating in the composition an agent containing in the molecule at least one P OH group, or a salt derivative thereof, which is obtained by reacting a compound containing the grouping O PO OHâ‚‚ with one or more epoxide group containing compounds at least one of which also contains at least one aromatic or alicyclic group.
