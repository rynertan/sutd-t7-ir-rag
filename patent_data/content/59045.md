# Electrostatic powder spray gun nozzle.

## Abstract
The invention is concerned with a nozzle assembly for a powder spray gun which may be an electrostatic gun and which includes an electrically non conductive barrel through which a high voltage electrical path passes. The nozzle assem bly is mounted in the open forward end of the barrel and in cludes a sleeve 45 located on the centre axis of the barrel for directing a flow of a pressurised gas, e.g. air, through the cen tre of the nozzle assembly, a nozzle 58 surrounding the sleeve defining an annular flow path for powder spray coating material encircling the flow of pressurised air and an air deflec tor cap 64 for directing the pressurised air radially outwardly and into the flow of powder spray coating material being emit ted from the nozzle. The air impacts the powder coating mate rial to form a conical spray pattern of coating material. The gun may also include an electrode 37 extending out of the nozzle assembly for electrostatically charging the powder. The nozzle assembly eliminates mechanical powder deflectors and the problems attendant therewith.
