# Coil insertion apparatus.

## Abstract
A coil insertion apparatus F for inserting coils 8 , for example into stator cores 6 of electrical rotary machines, in which blades 5 and a coil pusher 9 of this apparatus F are arranged to be movable at optimum timing and speed suitable for various winding specifications of stators so as to make it possible to efficiently insert coils 8 having low coil ends and short circumferential lengths into stator cores, with simultaneous reduction of coil inserting resistance. The blades 5 are divided into bladegroups 10,11 each secured to a corresponding blade holder 12,13 . The blade holders 12,13 abd the coil pusher 9 are respectively provided with driving sections 15,16,29 which are independent of each other.
