## Description
The present invention relates to a process for the production of a composite material based on a polymer matrix. More particularly, the invention relates to a process for the preparation of a composite material based on a polymer matrix comprising, homogeneously dispersed therein, an organic and or inorganic filler charge . As is known, in many applications there are used materials comprising a polymer matrix in which are dispersed organic and or inorganic fillers which impart to the composite material particular properties such as colour or mechanical resistance. These composite materials in general are produced by mixing the organic and or inorganic filler in the form of a powder with the polymer likewise in the form of a powder, usually in the presence of a dispersing medium, for example oil. This type of process requires that the polymer be processable on special machines, and that, moreover, the materials used as fillers possess specific dispersability characteristics. In the case of thermoplastic polymers, there are required both high temperatures as well as a high quantity of energy for the mixing of the filler with the polymer in the molten state. It is also known to produce composite materials by using a process comprising mixing with an aqueous dispersion of the polymer latex the filler in the form of a powder, and by then coagulating the resulting dispersion and then separating the coagulated composite material. Even if this process of mixing requires small quantities of energy, the composite material thus obtained does not exhibit a satisfactory homogeneity as required in certain applications. Moreover, the addition of the organic and or inorganic filler to the latex may lead to the coagulation of the polymer before complete homogenization is achieved. GB A 2071112 discloses a method of producing filler containing PTFE powder, in which aqueous dispersions of PTFE particles and filler particles are mixed and coagulated. A substance containing a polyvalent cation is added to the mixture to ensure that the filler particles have a positive charge. A water immiscible organic liquid is required to coagulate the particles. The present invention aims to provide a process for the preparation of a composite material based on a polymer matrix having homogeneously dispersed therein an organic and or inorganic filler, which process overcomes or at least mitigates the above described disadvantages. More particularly, the invention aims to provide a composite material based on a polymer matrix, comprising dispersed therein an organic and or inorganic filler, having a high grade of uniformity, prepared by a quite simple process and with the use of only small quantities of energy. It has now been surprisingly found that these aims may be achieved if the following conditions are satisfied According to the present invention, such conditions are satisfied by a process for the production of a composite material based on a polymer matrix, comprising homogeneously dispersed therein an organic and or inorganic filler, the said process comprising mixing together the single components in the form of aqueous dispersions in which the particles have a surface charge of the same sign and a zeta potential in absolute value of from 10 mV to 100 mV and the ratio in absolute value between the zeta potentials of the particles of each dispersion is from 0.2 to 5, and then by coagulating the mixed dispersion thus obtained. It is preferred that the zeta potential in absolute value of the particles of each dispersion is from 15 to 70 mV and that the ratio in absolute value between the zeta potentials is from 0,5 to 2, in the process of the present invention. In the preparation of the composite material, any polymer matrix can be used, but the matrix is preferably in the form of a latex, more preferably a matrix obtained by emulsion polymerization. Examples of polymers that may be used in the process of the present invention are fluorinated polymers and elastomers such as polytetrafluoroethylene copolymers of vinylidene fluoride and hexafluoropropylene terpolymers of vinylidene fluoride, hexafluoropropylene and tetrafluoroethylene terpolymers of vinylidene fluoride, tetrafluoroethylene and perfluoroalkyl vinyl ethers copolymers of tetrafluoroethylene and perfluoroalkyl vinyl ethers copolymers of tetrafluoroethylene and propylene copolymers of vinylidene fluoride and chloro trifluoro ethylene copolymers of vinylidene fluoride and hydropentafluoropropylene terpolymers of vinylidene fluoride, hydropentafluoropropylene and tetrafluoroethylene, and the corresponding products having in the chain small quantities of trifluoro bromo ethylene chlorinated co polymers such as polyvinylchloride and polyvinylidenechloride polymers and copolymers such as polyacrylonitrile polymethacrylates and polymethylmethacrylates polybutadiene and polyisoprene polycarbonates acrylonitrile butadiene styrene polymers, known as ABS resins vinyl co polymers such as polyvinylacetate, ethylene vinylacetate EVA copolymers, and polyvinyl alcohol PVA and in general any polymer and copolymer obtained by an emulsion polymerization process. Examples of inorganic fillers that may be used in the preparation of the composite material are pigments. graphite, bronze in powder form, ground glass in the form of spheres or fibres, molybdenum sulphide, silica, steel powder, metal oxides, carbonates, and silicates. Examples of organic fillers that can be used are organic pigments, stabilizers, and any polymer or resin different from that which forms the polymer matrix. According to the present invention, composite materials in which the filler or charge is homogeneously dispersed in the matrix, are obtained if the single components are mixed together starting from preformed dispersions in which the particles are completely wetted by the dispersing medium and have a surface charge of the same sign and comparable stabilities. By the term stability there is meant the capacity of the particles to remain in the dispersed state. The stability of a dispersed system may be measured by the zeta potential, defined as the electric potential at the particle solution plane of slippage. The zeta potential of particles in a dispersion may be determined by an electrokinetic means, such as electrophoresis, electro osmosis, or potential current flow, as described for example in Colloid Science , vol. 1, by H.R. Kruyt, published by Elsevier Publishing Co., of 1952. The adjusting of the zeta potential value of the components of each dispersion may be carried out by acting on the mechanisms which control the formation of the surface charge. A suitable method for varying the zeta potential is that of varying the pH of the dispersion or otherwise by adding surfactants, polyelectrolytes or ions specifically adsorbed, such as sodium laurylsulphate, ammonium perfluoro octanoate, sodium polyacrylate, sodium hexametaphosphate, or sodium phosphate. After the mixing of the dispersions of the single components, the resulting dispersion is coagulated. The coagulation phase is preferably carried out in a fast way in order to avoid the selective coagulation of the single components of the dispersion, with a consequential dishomogeneity of the coagulate. Any technique for coagulating the dispersion may be used, such as vigorous stirring, the addition of electrolytes or the addition of a liquid in which the dispersions are not stable, or a combination of said techniques. The preferred method in the process of the present invention is the addition of electrolytes such as sulphuric acid, magnesium nitrate, or aluminium sulphate, at a concentration at least sufficient to coagulate the dispersion, combined, if necessary, with a vigorous stirring. The separation of the coagulate from the dispersing medium may be obtained by using conventional techniques such as floatation, filtration, centrifugation, decantation or a combination of said techniques. The use of the various separation techniques depends on the polymeric matrix used. More particularly, when the polymer phase is polytetrafluoroethylene, a preferred method may be the floatation of the coagulate by using vigorous stirring, while for composite materials based on polyvinylchloride or on tetrafluoroethylene vinylidene fluoride copolymer, it is advisable to effect the separation by filtration. In order to avoid possible adverse effects due to the presence of electrolytes in the coagulate, after the separation there may be carried out one or more washings of the coagulate. The composite material thus obtained according to the process of the invention, under examination by a microscope, is found to be substantially perfectly uniform. The invention will be further described with reference to the following illustrative Examples. In the Examples, all parts and percentages are by weight, unless otherwise stated. A dispersion of a red pigment based on iron oxide Bayer 110M was prepared in distilled water, at a concentration of 10 g l, by means of ultrasounds. The particles of dispersed pigment showed a zeta potential equal to 25 mV. Thereupon, 20 ml of the dispersion were added, under mild stirring 50 r.p.m. to a polytetrafluoroethylene latex PTFE containing 40 g of polymer the thus obtained dispersion was then diluted with distilled water until there was obtained a concentration of the PTFE equal to 100 g l. In the latex the PTFE particles showed a zeta potential of 30 mV, measured by microelectrophoresis. To this mixed dispersion thus obtained there were added 10 ml of H₂SO₄ 30 by weight , while the stirring was rapidly increased to 700 r.p.m. The dispersion coagulated completely in a time less than 5 minutes. The stirring was maintained for another 10 minutes in order to float the coagulate. The powder, separated from the liquid by filtration on a nylon net, was then dried for 12 hours at 140 C. A thin ribbon prepared with the pigmented product exhibited a perfectly uniform colour, mechanical and dielectric properties similar to those of a non pigmented ribbon, and the absence of pigment coagulates under microscopic analysis. A pigment based on cadmium sulphoselenide CP 2400, Ferro Co.. USA was dispersed, at a concentration of 10 g l, in an aqueous solution containing 1 g l of sodium hexametaphosphate, by using a ball mill of the Red Devil type. The pigment particles had a zeta potential of 46 mV, measured by electro osmosis. 20 ml of the dispersion were then added, under mild stirring 50 r.p.m. , to a PTFE latex containing 40 g of polymer the dispersion was thereupon diluted with distilled water to a concentration of 100 g l. In the latex the PTFE particles showed a zeta potential of 30 mV, measured by electrophoresis. To the mixed dispersion were then rapidly added, under constant stirring, 20 ml of a Mg NO₃ ₂ 1 M solution, thereby causing bulk coagulation of the particles. The coagulate was then separated by floating, increasing the stirring to 700 r.p.m. The powder had a uniform colour and was dried at 140 C for 12 hours. A ribbon prepared with the pigmented powder exhibited a uniform colour, dielectric and mechanical properties similar to those of a non pigmented ribbon, and the absence of pigment coagulates under microscopic analysis. A sample of graphite FOLIAC X6236 was dispersed at a concentration of 10 g l, in an aqueous solution containing 1 g l of sodium polyacrylate, by using a Red Devil ball mill. 60 ml of the dispersion were thereupon added to 120 ml of a PTFE latex containing 40 g of polymer. The zeta potential of the graphite particles, measured by electro osmosis, was 15 mV, while the zeta potential of the PTFE, measured by electrophoresis, was 30 mV. The dispersion thus obtained was then diluted, under mild stirring 50 r.p.m. , to a volume of 400 ml. Still under mild stirring, there were then added 20 ml of a Mg NO₃ ₂ 1 M solution, causing complete coagulation of the slurry. The thus coagulated polymer was then floated under stirring at about 700 r.p.m. The obtained powder, dried at 140 C for 12 hours, was seen to be perfectly uniform under microscopic analysis. A thin ribbon prepared with the dried powder had a uniform colour. 40 ml of a slurry, obtained by dispersing 25 g of glass fibre in 100 ml of an aqueous solution containing 1 g l of sodium hexametaphosphate, were added to 120 ml of a PTFE latex containing 40 g of the polymer. The zeta potential of the glass fibre, measured by electro osmosis, was 51 mV, while the zeta potential of the PTFE, measured by electrophoresis, was 30 mV. The obtained slurry, diluted to a volume of 400 ml, was then additioned with 20 ml of a Mg NO₃ ₂ 1 M solution, under a mild stirring 100 r.p.m. . The addition of the electrolyte caused complete coagulation of the dispersion. The coagulate was thereupon floated, under vigorous stirring 700 r.p.m. , for a period of 15 minutes. The powder thus obtained, dried for 12 hours at 140 C, under microscopic analysis, was showed to be formed of glass fibres singularly dispersed in the polymer matrix. A PTFE latex was added, in an amount of 10 by weight, to a latex made of a Tecnoflon fluoroelastomer Tecnoflon is a registered trade mark . The zeta potential of the PTFE latex was 30 mV, while the zeta potential of the fluoroelastomer was 50 mV, both measured by electrophoresis. Then 200 ml of the mixed latex were slowly added to an equal volume of an aqueous solution containing 8 g l of Al₂ SO₄ ₃, maintained under vigorous stirring 500 r.p.m. . The slurry coagulated instantly. The coagulate, after separation by filtration and drying for 12 hours at 60 C, appeared under microscopic analysis to be perfectly uniform. A PTFE latex, containing 40 g of polymer, was additioned with a dispersion of red pigment CP2400 by Ferro Co., USA and a TiO₂ dispersion. The total of added pigments was equal to 3.5 on the PTFE. The zeta potentials of the particles were There were prepared various dispersions, with ratios by weight of red pigment TiO₂ pigment of 10 1, 2.5 1, 1 1, 1 2.5, 1 5, 1 10 and 1 20. The dispersions were coagulated as described in Example 2. The powders, dried for 12 hours at 140 C, were uniformly coloured. The colour of tablets, obtained by sintering of the powders at 400 C, ranged uniformly from red to pink as the red pigment TiO₂ pigment ratio decreased. 66.7 ml of a polyvinylchloride latex at a 300 g l concentration and 10 ml of a dispersion of a yellow F 897 pigment Ferro Co.. USA at a concentration of 10 g l were mixed with an aqueous solution containing 0.1 g l of sodium hexametaphosphate and 83.4 ml of distilled water. Thereupon, under a mild stirring, there were admixed 20 ml of a 1 M solution of Mg NO₃ ₂, thereby causing complete coagulation of the slurry. The coloured coagulate was then separated by filtration and dried for 48 hours at 50 C. The resulting powder was uniformly coloured.
