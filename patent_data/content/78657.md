# Numnah.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a numnah comprising two generally separate elements 10, 11 each of which may be disposed in use on a respective side of a horse s spine. Use of the numnah exerts no pressure on a horse s spine, reducing strain during prolonged use and improving ventilation of the horse s spine. Padding in the numnah may be adopted to suit any particular horse.

## Description
NUMNAH This invention relates generally to saddlery for horses and in particular relates to numnahs. Conventional numnahs take the form of quilted or padded cloths which may be draped over a horse s back. A saddle may be placed upon the numnah and secured to the latter. The numnah serves to cushion the horse s back and the saddle prevents the numnah from slipping during use. According to the present invention a numnah characterised in comprising two generally separate elements each of which may be disposed in use on a respective side of a horse s spine. Preferably the numnah is provided with means by which it may be secured to a saddle. The means may comprise tapes which may be tied to rings provided upon the saddle or upon the stirrup bar or any other convenient support. The elements may be entirely separate or may be joined together by one or more linkages such as tapes, cords or any other convenient means including buckles, press studs, hooks, hook and pile fastenings such asVelcro Registered Trade Mark fastenings. A preferred numnah comprises two elements joined at the rear or at any location along the length by a single tape, cord or tapes or cords or other linkage or linkages. The numnah may be provided with pockets located on the exterior of each element, the panels of a saddle being disposed in the pockets in use or tied by tapes or by use of Velcro Registered Trade Mark . The inner surface of each element which in use bears against the hide of a horse, may preferably comprise towelling, terry towelling or other absorbent textile material or non absorbent material such as that manufactured by Glentona Textiles Ltd., fur, sheepskin, leather or synthetic fur material, such as woollen synthetic fur, or any other convenient textile, or rubber or plastics material. The latter material may serve to absorb sweat and thereby reduce the likelihood of the horse catching a chill. The outer surface of each element which in use either bears against the saddle or is exposed to the atmosphere, is preferably composed of a durable but water or vapour permeable material, for example nylon, cotton drill, polyester cotton fabric or sheepskin.Impermeable materials provided with perforations may be used. This serves to facilitate the escape of water from the horse s skin. Padding may be provided between the inner and outer surfaces of each element. Suitable padding may incorporate foamed plastics or rubber material for example PLASTAZOTE foam, which may be suitably moulded, or felt, a thick layer thereof being disposed upon the upper portions of each element which bear the weight of a rider, and thinner portions or no padding being disposed at the lower portions of each element so that there may be close contact between a rider s legs and the horse. Alternatively, the padding may incorporate leather, fur or sheepskin. The said thick layer may be 2.5 cm thick or any thickness to accommodate the requirements of a particular horse and the said thin layer may be up to 1 cm thick. A numnah in accordance with the invention and composed of sheepskin or synthetic fur material may incorporate a double layer of sheepskin or synthetic fur material in the upper surfaces thereof and a single layer in the lower surfaces to provide good contact between a rider s legs and the horse. Alternatively, single and double layers of foamed plastics material or moulded plastics or rubber material may be used. The outer coverings of elements of a numnah in accordance with the invention may be provided with openings through which the padding may be removed. The openings are preferably closeable by interlocking textile strips or by any other convenient means. Removal of the padding facilitates both cleaning of the outer coverings and rearrangement of the padding to accommodate individual horse s physique. Use of a numnah constructed in accordance with this invention has the advantage that no pressure is exerted on the horse s spine. A further advantage is that the horse s spine remains ventilated and cool.The padding may also be rearranged in use as may be convenient. The invention will now be further described by way of example with reference to Figures 1 to 9 of the accompanying drawings, of which Figure 1 shows a first stage in manufacture of a numnah in accordance with the invention Figure 2 shows a second stage in the said manufacture Figure 3 shows a third stage in the said manufacture Figure 4 shows a completed numnah Figure 5 shows an alternative numnah Figure 6 shows the numnah of Figure 5 secured to a saddle Figures 7 and 8 show construction of an alternative numnah and Figure 9 shows use of a numnah in accordance with the invention. Two elements are required for each numnah, these being mirror images of each other. Figure 1 shows the outline of an element 2 cut out from a sheet of material. One edge of the outline is reinforced with tape 3. A pocket 4 is cut from cotton or other material and one edge of the pocket is hemmed as shown. Figure 2 shows the element 2 with a nylon tape 5 sewn into position. Two pairs of D shaped metal rings 6, 7 are secured to the tape 5 near the edges of the element 2. The tape 5 serves to prevent the element of the numnah from stretching during use. Figure 3 shows the element folded with the furry side inwards with the pocket 4 placed into position and stitched along one edge 8. The stitching is reinforced in the region of the tape 5. Figure 4 shows a completed element of a numnah formed by turning the element shown in Figure 3 inside out. The pocket 4 is adapted in use to receive a panel of a saddle. The upper half of the numnah 9 incorporates a double layer of furry material and therefore provides efficient cushioning in use between a saddle and a horse s back. Additional cushioning material may be incorporated into the numnahs for example, disposed between the double layer, if required. The lower part of the element which is generally covered by the pocket 4 incorporates only a single thickness of furry material and therefore provides close contact between the horse and a rider s leg. Figure 5 shows a numnah comprising two elements 10, 11 composed of textile material padded with foamed plastics, or rubber material. the inner surface of the element 11 is shown and is composed of towelling material. The outer surface of the element 10 is shown and comprises a nylon, cotton or polyester cotton outer layer and a pocket 13. The elements are secured in use to D shaped rings provided on a saddle by means of tapes 14. Alternatively rings and tapes may be provided upon each element. Any convenient method of securing the elements may be used. The elements shown in Figure 5 are shown secured to a saddle 15 in Figure 6. It can be seen that the numnah is disposed on either side of the median line of the saddle and, in use, does not bear against the horse s spine. The numnah illustrated in Figure 4 may be secured to a saddle in a similar manner to that shown in Figures 6 and 7. Figure 7 illustrates construction of an alternative numnah. Figure 7 shows the complete numnah and Figure 8 is a diagram illustrating the construction of an element of the numnah. The numnah comprises pockets 16 disposed in each element 17. The upper portions 18 of each element are provided with padding comprising Plastisort foamed plastics material. The fabric covering the inner surface 19 of each element is folded over the top 20 of the exterior of the element. The two elements are secured together by means of a tape 21 of the rear of the numnah.D rings 22 and tapes 23 serve to secure the numnah to a saddle not shown . Figure 8 shows an exploded diagrammatic view of the assembly of a numnah in accordance with the invention. The inner fabric 23 and outer fabric 24 are arranged to form a pocket for the padding 25. The inner fabric is folded upon the exterior surface of the element at 27. The mouth of the pocket is provided with strips 26, 28 of a self adhesive textile material such as Velcro Registered Trade Mark .A pocket 29 is provided to engage the panels of a saddle when in use. Edging tape 30 is provided along the lower and side edges of the element. Figure 9 shows a rear view of a numnah in use.The numnah 31 is disposed below a saddle 32. The space between the two elements 31 serves to remove the weight of the saddle from the horse s spine 33. The horse s spine may also be ventilated by passage of air between the elements 31. A tape connecting the two elements is shown at 34.
