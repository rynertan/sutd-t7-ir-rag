# Acrylic emulsion copolymers for thickening aqueous systems and copolymerizable surfactant monomers for use therein.

## Abstract
Acrylic emulsion copolymers are prepared by emulsion polymerization of A a surfactant monomer, B an α, β ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid monomer, C a nonionic α, β ethyenically unsaturated monomer and D optionally a polyethylenically unsaturated cross linking monomer. The surfactant monomer is prepared by conden sing an alcohol or primary amine containing nonionic surfac tant with a monoethylenically unsaturated monoisocyanate. At a low pH the copolymer may be in the form of an aqueous dispersion or latex, but thickens upon neutralization of at least some of the carboxyl groups.
