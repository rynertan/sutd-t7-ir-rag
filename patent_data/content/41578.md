# DEVICE FOR MONITORING ABNORMALITY IN SAMPLED SIGNALS.

## Abstract
Device for detecting an abnormal condition in an apparatus on the basis of sampled signals obtained by sampl ing a periodic AC signal at a predetermined time interval. The device includes a memory circuit 3 for storing n n 3 con secutive items of data obtained by digitally converting a periodic AC signal which has been sampled at predetermined time intervals, and a coincidence detection circuit 4 for checking whether the stored content of the memory circuit is the same for each sampling, thereby to detect an abnormality in the sampled signals. The device is therefore suitable for monitoring malfunctions in the analogue data input section of a digital processing unit.
