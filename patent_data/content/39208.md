# A cable stranding machine.

## Abstract
A cable stranding machine has an elongate rotor 1 com prising at least one pair of longitudinal beams 9,10 and pairs of bobbin bearing devices 16,17 mounted on the beams in spaced relationship along the rotor length. The bearing devices have pintles 19 supporting thread bobbins 29 for rotation about parallel horizontal axes perpendicular to the rotor axis. Each pintle 19 is rotatable relative to a pintle support 18, 27 which in turn is secured to the respective rotor beam 10,9 . One or preferably both pintle supports in each pair of bearing devices are formed with means 32 34 permit ting them to be secured to the respective beam in a finite number of different axial positions, whereby the rotor can readily be adjusted to receive bobbins of correspondingly different nominal width. Additionally, at least one pintle 19 in each pair of opposed bobbin bearing devices is axially displaceable relative to its pintle support 27 between an advanced position in which a bobbin is held securely between the opposed pintles for rotation therewith, and a retracted position utilized for loading and unloading the rotor.
