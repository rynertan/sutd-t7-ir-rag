# Method of filling a container and filling nozzle.

## Abstract
In a method for the filling of a container with a potable liquid, such as fruit juice, and using a filler nozzle for practicing the method, the potable liquid to be dispensed into a container is directed to the interior surface of the container at a point above its intended fill level. By virtue of this method, foaming and splashing are minimized. Further, a plurality of annularly spaced passageways are provided in the head of the dispensing nozzle, wherein the ratio of the length to the diameter of each of the passageways is not less than a certain minimum value. With this minimum value, found for many liquids to be four, when the valve to which the nozzle is attached is shut off, capillary attraction of the liquid remaining in the nozzle and within the passageways thereof inhibits further flow of the liquid downwardly into the container, thereby inhibiting problems caused by dripping and drooling.
