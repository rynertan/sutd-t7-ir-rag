# Gallium arsenide VLSI chip.

## Abstract
A gallium arsenide VLSI circuit chip which can be manu factured by known methos provides improved power output from the devices and greater packing density. A signal source 12 is connected through a voltage level shifting network comprising diodes 47, 48 and a pull down transistor T1 to the gate electrode of a transistor T2 con nected to act as a source follower amplifier. This transistor is of a novel type comprising a uniform depth implant region hav ing a concentration of about 10ยนโธ atoms per cubic centimeter and extending through the source, gate, and drain regions. A second similar transistor T3 may be connected in series with the transistor T2 to provide the impedance for the source follower amplifier stage.
