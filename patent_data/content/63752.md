# FLUSHABLE MANIFOLD FOR DIAPHRAGM PROTECTED COMPONENTS

## Abstract
A flushable manifold for diaphragm protected com ponents of a pressure transducer for sensing a flow of fluid comprises a housing having a recess, a diaphragm of flexible material over and closing the recess and fluid inlet and outlet passages on opposite sides of the recess. To facilitate cleaning the manifold of fluid, at least one channel is formed in the housing within the recess in communication with the inlet and extending toward peripheral side areas of the recess to direct flushing media introduced at the inlet across all of the surfaces of the manifold to thoroughly clean the same.
