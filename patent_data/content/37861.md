This addition reaction is accomplished by introducing one of such latter compounds dropwise to the polyamine or a solution of the polyamine in water or in an inert organic solvent at temperatures within the range of from 0 C to 1000C, preferably from 200C to 600C. Generally, the reaction is exothermic. The evolution of heat in this reaction can easily be controlled by adjusting the speed of dropwise addition of the reactant or by cooling the reaction solution. The polyamine produced can easily be purified by distillation under a vacuum, for example. Where the reaction produces two or more polyamines, they can be separated by purificattion. Optionally, the two or more polyamines produced simultaneously can be used in their unseparated form as the raw material. Desired polyamines can otherwise be easily produced by subjecting corresponding polyamines to a substitution reaction using halogenated benzyl derivatives and halogenated alkyl derivatives.This last reaction is readily carried out by introducing the halogenated alkyl derivative dropwise into the given polyamine at temperatures within the range of from to 1000C, preferably from 200 to 600C. From the reaction solution, the polyamine desired is produced.by treating the solution with an equivalent weight of an alkali to neutralize the by product hydrogen halide and subjecting the solution to a treatment for purification. This reaction is generally carried out in the presence of an excess of thepolyamine, A polyamine having two or more identical substituents introduced therein can be produced by adjusting the amount of the polyamine used in the reaction.Then, the product obtained by the reaction in solution preferably in water and less preferably in another solvent such as an alcohol or dimethylformamide of CS2 and the N substituted polyamine is subjected to reaction with abase to form the desired salt. The CS2 reaction product is usually a free alkylenebisdithiocarbamic acid but it could be an amine salt if an excess of polyamine is used.The above two reactions areusaually carried out at temperatures within the range of 0 to 80 C.The preferred metal salts, i.e. those of metal s having a valency greater than one, can be produced by subjecting a water soluble salt of an appropriate N substituted alkylenebisdithiocarbamate to double decomposition with an appropriate water soluble metal salt. For example, the preparation may be effected by preparing a solution of a water soluble salt of an alkylenebisdithiocarbamate of Formula I and adding a water soluble metal salt capable of inducing double decomposition and allowing the reaction to proceed to its completion thereby causing formation of the desired precipitate. It may otherwise be effected by adding the two compounds at the same time into a reaction tank or even reversing the sequence of addition of the two compounds.As concerns the solvent, although the reactants are generally used in the form of aqueous solutions, any solvent may be effectively used insofar as solubility of the solutes involved is offered.Examples of the solvents advantageously used for the reaction include water, pyridine, methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, N methyl 2 pyrrolidone, dimethyl formamide, dimethylacetamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, dioxane, acetone and tetrahydrofuran. These solvents may be used in the form of mixtures. The reaction is carried out at temperatures within the range of from 0 to 70 C or even higher such as 80 C. The metal salt produced by this reaction is isolated generally in the form of a solid. This fact holds good even when the reaction solution contains water of crystallization and or a solvent. The by product inorganic salts can easily be removed by washing the precipitate with water. Where the presence of such by product inorganic salts is not deleterious, the washing treatment may be omitted.Examples of the soluble metal salt used for the double decomposition reaction include those of zinc, manganese, iron, copper, nickel, tin, cobalt, calcium and magnesium.These metal salts are quite effective when they are used in the form of a mixture of two or more members.Specifically, there may be used zinc chloride, zinc sulfate, zinc nitrate, zinc acetate, manganese chloride, manganese sulfate, manganese nitrate, manganese acetate, copper chloride, copper sulfate, copper nitrate, copper acetate, iron chloride, iron sulfate, iron nitrate, nickel chloride, nickel sulfate, tin chloride, tin sulfate, tin nitrate, cobalt chloride, cobalt sulfate, cobalt nitrate, calcium chloride, calcium nitrate, magnesium chloride and magnesium nitrate. Other soluble metal salts may also be used.The N substituted alkylenebisdithiocarbamates provided by the present invention are generally stable at room temperature. They nevertheless tend to undergo gradual decomposition when exposed to high temperatures or stored for a long time. Incorporation of a stabilizer imparts enhanced stability to these products. The stabilizer may be added either in the course of manufacture of the salts or during the formulation of fungicidal compositions. Examples of stabilizers are para formaldehyde and hexamethylenetetramine.The following Examples 1 3 illustrate the preparation of the metal salts provided by the invention. After these examples, there follows in Table I the identification of the metal salts of Examples 1 3 as well as the identification of many other additional metal salts within the scope of the invention. Example 1 In 200 ml of water, 47 g of an aqueous 40 by weight sodium N 2 hydroxy 3 isopropoxypropyl ethylenebis dithiocarbamate solution containing 0.05 moleof the sodium salt was stirred at room temperature. To the resultant aqueous solution, 13.6 g of an aqueous 50 zinc chloride solution containing 0.05 mole ZnC12 was gradually added dropwise. After the dropwise addition, the reaction solution was stirred continuously for three hours at room temperature and there were formed crystals which were separated by filtration and washed with water to remove impurities. The washed crystals were dried at 50 to 60 C under a vacuum. Thus was obtained a zinc salt of N 2 hydroxy 3 isopropoxypropyl ethylenebisdithiocarbamic acid Compound 6, Table I .Compounds 1 5 and 7 60 in Table I were prepared in a similar manner using the appropriate starting materials.Example 2 In 50 ml of water, 13 g of an aqueous 48 by weight sodium N 2 mercaptoethyl ethylenebisdithiocarbamate solution containing 0.02 mole of the sodium salt was stirred at 450 to 50 C. The remaining part of the procedure was performed under a current of nitrogen gas.To the resultant sodium salt solution, 9.5 g of an aqueous 26.5 manganous chloride solution containing 0.02 mole MnC12 was gradually added dropwise at temperatures of 400 to 500C. After the dropwise introduction, the resultant mixture was stirred at 450C for one hour and there were formed crystals which were separated by filtration and washed with water to remove impurities. The washed crystals were dried under a vacuum to produce a manganese salt of N 2 mercaptoethyl ethylenebisdithiocarbamic acid compound 61,Table I .Example 3 There was prepared an aqueous solution of the compoundEMI13.1 This solution was formed by adding to 300 ml of water, with stirring and at room temperature, 24 g of an aqueous 50 by weight solution of the sodium salt 0.03 mole .To the solution thus prepared, 13 g of an aqueous 50 zinc chloride solution containing 0.045 mole ZnC12 was gradually added dropwise at room temperature. After the dropwise addition, the resultant mixture was stirred at 45 C for one hour and there were formed crystals which were separated by filtration and washed with water to remove impurities. The washed crystals were dried at 500 to 600C under vacuum. Thus was obtained the zinc salt identified as Compound 63 in Table I. Compounds 62 and 64 67 in Table I were prepared in a similar manner using the appropriate starting materials.

and every single member of the group consisting of Zn Cu , Fe , Ni , Ca , Mg Co and Mn Mn being the preferred replacement metal , thus providing a total number of 7 x 67 469 additional specific compounds within the scope of the present invention. The compounds listed in Table I above could also be represented by formulae corresponding to that of Formula III so that, for example, Compound No. 1 could be represented as EMI28.1 Compound 36 could be represented as EMI28.2 Compound 62 could be represented as EMI28.3 and so on for the rest of the compounds in Table I.Infrared absorption data for each of Compounds 1 31, 33 39, 41 44 and 47 67 of Table I are set out on the accompanying drawings in which Figures 1 31 show, respectively, infrared absorption spectra for Compounds 1 31 Figures 32 38 show, respectively, the data for Compounds 33 39 Figures 39 42 show, respectively, the data for Compounds 41 44 andFigures 43 63 show, respectively, the data for Compounds 4767. The infrared data were obtained using the KBr disc method. Although attempts have been made to assign precise and accurate chemical formulae to the above described etal salts in accordance with the invention i.e. salts of metals having a valency greater than 1 , this has not proved entirely feasible because these salts have a complex structure and they may even be polymeric as is thought to be the case with maneb, mancozeb and zineb vide, for example, ThePesticide Manual, The British Crop Protection Council, 6thEdition 1979 . In general these complex metal salts are not water soluble.Some or all of Compounds 1 67 were evaluated as fungicides as described in the following two tests.Test 1 To cucumbers species Tokiwa hikari Sango grown in a greenhouse to the three leaf stage, there were applied aqueous suspensions each containing 1500 ppm of active ingredient, of Compounds 1 67 identified in Table I which were used in the form of 75 wt wettable powders. The suspensions were applied with the aid of a small glass spray. On the second day after this spraying, a suspension of spores of scab Cladosporium cucumerinum was sprayed on the treated cucumbers. The cucumbers were kept in a hot house with humidity of not less than 90 to promote the infection of cucumbers by the fungal spores. On the 10th day after this infection with the spores, the two uppermost of the leaves which were open at the time of the spraying were examined and rated for degree of disease on the 0 4 scale to calculate the control index.In the 0 4 scale , 0 no disease, 1 5 per cent or less of leaf area diseased, 2 5 20 per cent of leaf area diseased, 3 20 50 percent of leaf area diseased and 4 more than 50 percent of leaf area diseased. The results obtained are set forth in Table II below.

The suspensions were applied with the aid of a small powdered spray. On the second day after this spraying, a suspension of spores of Phytopthora infestans were sprayed uniformly on the treated tomatoes to infect them. On the 10th day after this infection, five main leaves per stock and seven small leaves per main leaf were examined to take count of disease spots on the scale of 0, 1 and 2 to calculate the control index.In the 0, 1 and 2 scale, 0 no disease, 1 less than 20 percent of leaf area diseased and 2 20 percent or more of leaf area diseased.

Examples of substituted ammonium groups are methylammonium, dimethylammonium, benzyltrimethylammonium and dibenzyldiethylammonium.Typical salts of Formula IV are alkali metal, ammonium and substituted ammonium salts of each of the N substituted alkylenebisdithiocarbamic acid for which the N substituted diamines and polyethylenepolyamines listed earlier in this specification are precursors.Salts of Formula IV may be prepared by the reaction of an acid of Formula I with an appropriate base or by a metathesis reaction involving a salt of an acid of Formula I. An example of such a metathesis, reaction would be when CS2 is reacted with an excess of a diamine, eg an N substituted ethylenediamine, thereby producing an amine salt of an acid of FormulaI, the amine salt being then reacted with an alkali metal hydroxide to form the corresponding alkali metal salt. These reactions are preferably carried out in solution in a solvent such as water and alcohol, dimethylformamide or other inert solvent.The reaction temperature used may, in general, be from OOC to 1000C, preferably 200C to 500C, 700C or 800C and more preferably 300C to 400C. The acid of Formula I may be produced in situ by the reaction of carbon do sulfide and an appropriate diamine or other polyamine in the presence of a base which then reacts with the acid formed to produce the desired salt of Formula IV. The reaction between CS2 and the diamine or other polyamine is exothermic to some extent and generally proceedsoreadily at temperatures of 300 to 400C. The reaction temperature can be adjusted by controlling the speed of the dropwise addition of CS2 or by cooling the reaction system externally.For example, the reaction may be carried out by adding CS2 dropwise to a solution containing diamine or other polyamine and a base which give rises to the desired salt. For salts wherein Y and or Y is a CHR CHR, O C M M , group there can be used a diamine or other polyamine reactant containing one or two N substituents of the formula CHR CHR3 OH which also react with CS2 to give the aforementioned salt group. Desirably this reaction is carried out in a solvent such as water, dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, alcohols such as ethanol or N methyl pyrrolidone and at a temperature of 350 to 450C. Examples of bases advantageously used for the production of the water soluble salts of Formula IV are alkalis such as lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, lithium carbonate, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate and potassium bicarbonate ammonia and aqua ammonia alkylamines such as methylamine, dimethyl amine, ethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, propylamine, dipropylamine, butylamine, ethylenediamine, diethylenetriamine, triethylenetetramine, propylenediamine, monethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, N 2 hydroxyethyl ethylenediamine, N 2 hydroxyethyl hydrazine and hydrazine aryl amines and aralkyl amines such as aniline, phenylenediamine, xylylenediamine and benzylamine and heterocyclic amines such as morpholine, piperazine, pyridine and quinoline. The following Examples 4 9 illustrate the preparation of salts of Formula IV. After these examples, there follows inTable IV the identification of the metal salts of Examples 4 9 as well as the identification of many other additional salts of Formula IV.Example 4While 20 g 0.114 mol of N 3 isopropoxy 2 hydroxy propyl ethylenediamine and 30 g of water were stirred at room temperature 200C , 17 g 0.228 mol of carbon disulfide was gradually added dropwise thereto. The reaction temperature was kept just below 380C. After the dropwise addition of CS2, the resultant mixture was stirred at 350 to 38 0C for one hour.Then, 19 g of an aqueous 48 by weight caustic soda solution 0.228 mole NaOH was gradually added dropwise to neutralize the solution. The reaction tempererature was again kept just below 38 C. After the dropwise of NaOH, the mixture was again stirred at 380 to 42 0C for two hours and there resulted a light yellow, transparent aqueous solution of sodium N 3 isopropoxy 2 hydroxypropyl ethylenebisdithio carbamate Compound 72, Table IV . Compounds 68 71 and 73 79 in Table IV were prepared in a similar manner using the appropriate polyamine precursor and caustic soda, aqua ammonia or dimethylamine. Each of Compounds 68 79 was freed of water by evaporation of water from the solution followed by drying under vacuum.Example 5While 42 g 0.55mol of carbon disulfite and 50 g of water were stirred at room temperature 20 C , 44 g 0.275 mol of N 2 ethoxycarbonylethyl ethylenediamine was gradually added dropwise. With the reaction temperature being kept just below 38 0C, the mixture was stirred for one hour. To the solution, 46 g of an aqueous 48 caustic soda solution 0.55 mol NaOH was added dropwise with the temperature again being kept below 38 0C. After the dropwise addition of the NaOH solution, the stirring was continued for three hours at 38 0C and there resulted a yellow, transparent aqueous solution of sodium N 2 ethoxycarbonylethyl ethylenebis dithiocarbamate Compound 81, Table IV .Compounds 80 and 82 99 in Table IV were prepared in a similar manner using the appropriate polyamine precursor and caustic soda, caustic potash or aqua ammonia.

After the dropwaise addition of CS2, the mixture was stirred at 350 to 38 0C for three hours and there resulted a uniform, clear aqueous solution of sodium N 2,4,5 trimethylbenzyl ethylenebisdithiocarbamate Compound 104, Table IV .Compounds 100 103 and 105 110 in Table IV were prepared in a similar manner using the appropriate polyamine precursor and caustic soda. Each of Compounds 100 110 was freed of water by evaporation of water from the solution followed by drying under vacuum.Example 7While 31 g 0.4 mol of carbon disulfide and 40 g of water were stirred, 24 g 0.2 mol of N e2 mercaptoethyl ethylene diamine was gradually added dropwise with the temperature being kept just below 38 C. After the dropwise addition of the diamine, the mixture was stirred at 35 C to 38 C for one hour. Thereafter, 34 g of an aqueous 48 caustic soda solution 0.4 mole NaOH was gradually added dropwise to achieve neturalization, the reaction temperature again being kept below 380C. After the dropwise addition of the caustic soda solution, the mixture was stirred at 380C for two hours and, thereafter, cooled to room temperature. There resulted a uniform clear aqueous solution of sodium N 2 mercapto ethyl ethylenebisdithiocarbamate Compound 111, Table IV .Compounds 112 116 were prepared in a similar fashion using the appropriate polyamine precursor and caustic soda, aqua ammonia or methylamine. Each of Compounds 112 116 was freed of water by evaporation of water from the solution followed by drying under vacuum.Example 8In 55 g of water, 60 g 0.25 mol of N dodecylethylenediamine and 85 ml of ethanol were stirred at room temperature 200C until the diamine was dissolved. To the solution thus obtained, 40 g 0.5 mol of carbon disulfite was added dropwise, with the temperature being kept just below 35 C. After the dropwise addition of CS2, the mixture was stirred atroom temperature for two hours. Then, 42 g of an aqueous 48 caustic soda solution 0.5 mol NaOH was gradually added dropwise, with the temperature again being kept just below 38 C thereafter stirring was carried out 42 C for one hour and there resulted a uniform clear aqueous solution of sodium.N dodecylethylenebisdithiocarbamate Compound 119, Table IV .Compounds 117, 118 and 120 124 were prepared in a similar manner using the appropriate polyamine precursor and caustic soda, caustic potash or aqua ammonia. Each ofCompounds 117 124 was freed of liquid by evaporation thereof from the solution followed by drying under vacuum.Example 9While 55 g 0.72 mol of carbon disulfide and 100 ml of dimethylformamide were stirred at room temperature, 25 g 0.24 mol of N 2 hydroxyethyl ethylenediamine was gradually added dropwise with the temperature kept below the level of 35 0C. The mixture was stirred at 35 0C for one hour. Thereafter, 31 g of solid 93 caustic soda 0.72 mole NaOH was added with the temperature kept below the level of 45 C. After the addition of the caustic soda, the mixture was stirred at a temperature between 420 and 450C for one hour and there resulted a uniform clear aqueous solution of a compound Compound 125, Table IV which was the starting compound of the foregoing Example 3 in which the formula of the compound in question is given.
