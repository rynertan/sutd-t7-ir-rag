## Description
The present invention relates to a data processing device which is provided with a liquid crystal display having electroluminescent backlighting. Normally, manufactures are required to design displays as small as possible so that data processing machines themselves may be made more compact. Liquid crystal display devices are available to help realize this goal, but since they cannot illuminate themselves, such displays are usually dark and often indiscernible. There has been proposed a device equipped with an electroluminescent panel to provide the necessary backlighting. However, use at a high level of luminosity considerably shortens the service life of electroluminescent panels. The primary aim of the present invention is to provide a novel data processing device which allows the operator manually to change the luminosity of the electro luminescent panel in accordance with the lighting conditions under which the data processing device is operated. Other objects and further scope of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description given hereinafter. It should be understood, however, that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention, are given by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed description. Briefly described, the present invention pertains to a data processing device which is provided with a liquid crystal display unit having electroluminescent backlighting. The backlighting panel is provided with several degrees of luminosity and the means for selecting a specific degree of luminosity in order to allow the electroluminescent panel to emit light of a specific luminosity. The present invention will become more fully understood from the detailed description given hereinbelow and the accompanying drawings which are given by way of illustration only, and thus are not limitative of the present invention and wherein Referring now to the accompanying drawings, one of the preferred embodiments of the present invention is described below. FIG. 1 is an external view of a data processing device reflecting one of the preferred embodiments of the present invention. in FIG. 1, a liquid crystal display unit 3 is provided at the front of a data processing device 1. A keyboard 2 is connected electrically to the data processing device 1. As shown in FIG. 2, the keyboard 2 is provided with a number of data input keys 2a and function keys 2b for generating control commands. The function keys 2b include a SET UP key 27, which displays a set up menu for setting the initial data processing mode of the device, and cursor keys 28a, 28b, 28c, and 28d. The set up menu depicted in FIG. 3 is displayed by operating the set up key 27. In FIG. 1, the reference numeral 4 denotes a lamp which is described below. FIG. 4 is a simplified block diagram of the data processing device embodied by the present invention. This is a detailed representation of the electro luminescent panel drive controller. The block surrounded by the broken line denotes the controller. A main controller CPU 10 executes control operations in accordance with system programs stored in a read only memory ROM 11, which stores the message data needed to display the set up menu data in addition to the system programs. A random access memory RAM 12 stores the various data being input or processed and also contains a variety of buffers, counters and flags. In this embodiment, the RAM 12 is provided with at least a cursor counter and a B counter storing the luminosity level code of the electroluminescent panel. A timer 13, which counts a predetermined period of time, serves to turn off the electroluminescent panel light so that it will not incur damage when the user operates the key input or other processes for more than the predetermined period of time. A data latch 20 latches either the luminosity level code or the automatic OFF code of the B1 counter and drives an electroluminescent panel 24 in accordance with either of these code data. Code data stored in the data latch 20 is decoded by a decoder 21, which then outputs one of the four data signals shown below. In accordance with the data signal output from the decoder 21, a D A converter 22 converts the digital data signal into an analog data signal and controls the electroluminescent panel driver circuit before generating the appropriate drive voltage OV OFF , about 5V dim , about 6V standard , or about 8.5V bright in the electroluminescent panel 24. The D A converter 22 also drives a lamp driver 25 to illuminate a warning lamp 26 when the decoder 21 outputs an OFF SIGNAL. Referring now to the operation flowchart shown in FIG. 5, the luminosity modification operation of the electro luminescent panel 24 is described below. When, following automatic shut off of the electro luminescent panel 24, the user again activates the panel, its luminosity will be set according to the B1 counter. It should be noted that the luminosity settings of the electroluminescent panel in the set up menu used in the data processing device related to the present invention are not limitative of the preferred embodiments described above. Furthermore, the degrees of luminosity are not limited to the four levels specified using keyboards, as mentioned above. As is clear from the foregoing description, according to the present invention related to a data processing device provided with a liquid crystal display incorporating electroluminescent backlighting, the preferred embodiment provides for several degrees of luminosity and means for specifying luminosity levels. This enables the operator manually to adjust the luminosity ideally suited to the lighting environment in which the data processing device is used. At the same time, the system ensures a longer service life for the electroluminescent backlight, thereby reducing maintenance and replacement costs. While only certain embodiments of the present invention have been described, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as claimed.
