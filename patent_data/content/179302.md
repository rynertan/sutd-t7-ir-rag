# Gripping device for ropes and wires.

## Abstract
A device for gripping or locking a rope or wire 20 com prises a pair of rope engaging members or jaw members 16, 17 defining a pair of oppositely arranged wire engaging sur faces 18, 19 forming a passageway for the rope. The jaw members 16, 17 are mounted in the frame 10 of the grip ping device by means of a swinging link suspension including a pair of swinging links 22,23 . The jaw members 16,17 are suspended so that the frictional forces acting between the rope and the jaw members cause displacement of the rope engaging surfaces thereon in mutual parallel relationship to wards each other, when a pulling force is applied to the rope in a first direction, while the rope engaging surfaces are dis placed away from each other, when a pulling force is applied to the rope or wire in a second opposite direction. This means that the rope 20 is pinched between the rope engaging surfaces 18,19 , when the rope is pulled in the said first direction, and released, when pulled in said second direction. The jaw members may comprise a first jaw member 16 having a U shaped cross section with an inner bottom sur face defining a first rope engaging surface 18 , and a second jaw member 17 displaceably received within the first jaw member 16 . Corresponding swinging links 22,23 sus pending said first and second jaw members may be mounted pivotally about a common axis 24,25 and define an angle V therebetween, and these swinging members 22,23 are preferably formed as an integral part. The jaw members may be moved to a rope releasing position by means of an op erating handle 31 .
