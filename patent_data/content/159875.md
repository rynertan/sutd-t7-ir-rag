# Polyester and process for preparation thereof.

## Abstract
A polyester formed by adding compounds of the following formulae I and II to a reaction product of terephthalic acid or a dicarboxylic acid mixture mainly composed of therephthalic acid or an ester forming derivative thereof with at least one glycol or an ester forming derivative thereof, having a melt electrical resistance of not higher than 1600 10⁶ Ω and a softening point higher than the softening point derived from Flory s equation for the melting temperature of random copoly mers but lower than the softening point of a polyester obtained by adding a compound of formula I alone
