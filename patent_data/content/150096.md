# Method and apparatus for continuous on line monitoring of power distribution in a nuclear reactor core.

## Abstract
On line, real time monitoring of core wide and local power in an advanced pressurized water reactor is provided by a system having four channel sets of fixed incore nuclear detector strings distributed in fuel assemblies across the core in a pattern which produces a uniquely identifiable detector response to rod movement even with one channel set out of service. Separate signal processors for each channel generate totally independent core wide overpower protection signals and exchange detector responses through fiber optic data links for local power monitoring. Misalign ment of rods from the positions indicated by the position indicators is detected by a pattern recognition procedure for finding a fit between the effects of successive assumptions of misaligned rods and the detector responses adjusted for known rod movement.
