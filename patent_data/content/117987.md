# Two part handle assembly for electrical appliance.

## Abstract
In order to provide a more compact package for economical storage and shipment, of a vacuum cleaner, or the like, the handle is manufactured in two portions 300, 400 . The two portions are configured to fit together in a predetermined manner with a telescoping relationship and to concomitantly complete electrical connections through connectors 403 which are affixed to and internal to respective handle portions. At least one of the electrical connectors is allowed some longitudinal and rotational motion relative to its handle portion to facilitate electrical connector engagement and alignment. The assembly is held together by a fastener 610 passing through the telescoped handle portions and one of the connectors. A portion of one of the connector assemblies also serves to limit the excur sion of a compression spring 320 surrounding a portion of the associated handle portion.
