# Explosive composition and a method for the preparation thereof.

## Abstract
A powder explosive composition comprising particu late inorganic oxidising salt, finely divided metal sensitiser and, optionally additional fuel consisting of discrete granu les containing oxidising salt and sensitising metal coated with a tough, cohesive, resilient gelled solution of the oxidising salt, the amount of the coating being insufficient to form a continous gelled phase. The composition is more water resistant, less dusty and less sensitive to friction and impact than the metal sensitised powder compositions of the prior art.
