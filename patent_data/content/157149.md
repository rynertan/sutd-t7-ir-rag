# Fast breeder reactor.

## Abstract
In the fast breeder reactor according to this invention, a medium pressure plenum 47 and a high pressure plenum 48 are disposed, in the mentioned order from above in a reactor core 1 . Sodium is filled in the medium 47 and high pressure 48 plenums. The pressure in the medium pressure plenum 47 is lower than that in the high pressure plenum 48 . The lower ends of the entrance noz zles 29 of a multiplicity of fuel essemblies 2A, 2B loaded in the reactor core 1 are supported by a supporting plate 4 which forms a boundary between the medium 47 and a high pressure 48 plenums. The entrance nozzles 41 of control rod guide pipes 39 disposed among the multiplicity of fuel assemblies 2A, 2B are also supported by said supporting plate 4 . The sodium in the medium pressure plenum 47 is supplied into each control rod guide pipe 39 through a first opening 44 provided in the lateral surface of the entrance nozzle 41 of each control rod guide pipe 39 . The sodium in the high pressure plenum 48 is sup plied into each fuel assembly 2A from the lower end of the entrance nozzle 29 of each fuel assembly 2A through a second opening 32 provided piercing through the support ing plate 4 . The sodium in the high pressure plenum 48 is supplied to the medium pressure plenum 47 through a pressure reducing orifice 54 .
