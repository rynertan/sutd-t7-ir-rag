# Lead frame and electronic device employing the same.

## Abstract
A lead frame of an electronic device has a plurality of leads arranged in proximity to a tab 2 , wherein fore end sections 3a are once extended toward the tab 2 and are subsequently bent in a sense away from the tab 2 . The thus formed inner lead portions 3d , which are connected to bonding areas 8 of a chip 1 fixed on the tab 2 are disposed at sufficient depth within a sealing member, so that the invasion path for moisture is long and the resistance to moisture is enhanced. The resin material of the sealing member can be sufficiently packed in spaces corresponding to the bent parts, with the result that the strength of the package against mechanical and thermal stresses is raised. When the shape and length of the bent part are contrived, its wire bonding area 9 can be enlarged, and a large margin for positional deviations in wire bonding can be allowed.
