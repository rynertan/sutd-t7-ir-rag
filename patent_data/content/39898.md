# Apparatus for separating blood.

## Abstract
An apparatus for separating blood provided with a closed end and a thixotropic gel like sealant 2 with a specific gravity intermediate between the gravities of serum and clot phases comprising a cavity 3 formed on the upper surface of said sealant 2 . The sealant 2 consists essentially of an Î± olefin dimaleate copolymer having a viscosity from 10,000 to 120,000 c.p. 25 C , to which a viscosity specific gravity adjusting agent is added to adjust the specific gravity to 1.035 1.055. The cavity 3 is formed in such a size that diameter of the upper surface is from 0.15 to 0.7 times the inner diameter of the apparatus and its depth is from 0.13 to 0.65 times the thickness of said sealant.
