# Flame control system for heat exchanger.

## Abstract
Control circuits are provided for a heat exchange unit including environment responsive means placed in the general area of the heat exchange unit s heat exchanger or of the associated heat distribution network or return system. The environment responsive means is connected in series between the heat exchange unit s main control switch, such as a thermostat, and the fuel valve which controls the flow of fuel to the unit s burner. The environment responsive means may be either independent of, or connected in parallel with a heat circulator if any, associated with the unit s heat exchanger. The control circuits of the present invention control the action of the heat exchange units fuel valve to create an intermittent heating flame in response to environ mental changes at the heat exchanger, heat distribution network or return system during each heat demand cycle. This conserves fuel and energy by intermittently terminating the flow of fuel, and thus the burning of fuel, during each heat demand cycle while continuing to utilize and distribute heat stored in the heat exchanger during non fuel burning periods of each heat demand cycle.
