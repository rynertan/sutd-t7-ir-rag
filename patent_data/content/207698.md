# Cam actuated self locking hinge.

## Abstract
Concentric tubes 12, 14 , mounted for relative rotation about their common axis, each include radially extending hinge plates. The tubes carry contra rotational cam slots 20, 32 through which project the ends of a cross shaft 16 . Bear ings on the ends of the cross shaft engage the milled cam slots. A cylindrical cross roller bearing block 18 mounting the cross shaft is axially, slidably positioned within the inner tube and is under a basing force exerted by a compression spring 21 abutting one end of the block. The cam profiles of the slots includes portions at the ends of the slots extending parallel to the rotational axis to lock the inner and outer tubes together at the beginning and end of the stroke with the cam profile controlling hinge plate acceleration, deceleration, and velocity, in addition to ensuring positive locking of the hinge in plate open and closed position.
