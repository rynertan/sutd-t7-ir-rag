## Description
HEAT SENSITIVE FILM SHUTTER The present radiant invention relates to novel material for detecting applied heat energy, and more particularly to such a medium adapted as a film for detecting heat levels. INTRODUCTION, BACKGROUND This disclosure relates to optical media and associated techniques and apparatus which are adapted to detect a prescribed level of heat or prescribed radiation energy, especially with low power laser equipment. As workers know, success in designing and operating such a system depends greatly on the sensing medium.Workers in the art would be pleased to find a simple inexpensive film medium which could function as a light shutter to pass or block a monitor beam depending on whether the film shutter had experienced the test level of heat, etc. or not. This invention teaches a practical film shutter for this purpose, one adapted for long service life and for use with available simple low cost low power laser monitoring equipment. This shutter and various applications will be detailed below e.g., see FIG. 9 and related description but first a related optical recording medium and its associated applications is described. Recording media for radiation beams, generally Requirements for such ODD media are stringent e.g., involving high bit density and cost effective information storage at satisfactory write read rates preferably using low power lasers. Workers recognize the simplicity, speed and power of such laser implementation, where one need only modulate and deflect a laser beam for read write operations . In related applications e.g., video disk recording workers have used lasers and, for certain aspects thereof, have suggested media using a metal film as an information layers this layer to be softened, melted or vaporized e.g., thermally ablated by a write laserbeam so as to form a void a pit, hole, bubble, etc., or other deformation in the layer as the bit . Such a film may be coated on the surface of a rotating disk. Some workers have felt that such laser recording would be promising for computer records of various kinds e.g., the mentioned ODD media. They have predicted that practical systems await archival media which is responsive to lowpower laser writing and that this in turn depends on whether one can find such an information layer material able to be melted tor vaporized, etc. at current practical low power levels. This may also depend on the radiation efficiency of the associated system. Thus, workers have for some time been looking for such laser recording materials which exhibit high thermal efficiency a measure of how much of the heat generated at the recording site remains sufficiently localized to allow pit formation . For thus they have considered recording materials with a low melting point and low thermal diffusivity tellurium, lead, bismuth and indium are examples . The low melting point presumably facilitates a write pulse of minimum energy thus minimizing system cost or increasing bandwidth. And, since workers feel one must use a low power laser for such recording e.g., to enhance the operating life of a laser and minimize its cost and size , it has seemed even more desirable that the metal chosen for such an information absorber film have an outstandingly low melting point adequately high sensitivity 1 so that the desired bit void may be formed with minimal laser power. Te absorber films Now, many workers have contemplated using tellurium lie absorber films for this, or related, laser recording.There are several reasons. Tellurium has an attractively low bulk melting point about 450 C , conducts heat poorly and appears able to provide good sensitivity and SIN ratio also, it is relatively convenient to deposit as a thin film. Bismuth is also commonly suggested for similar reasons. And related alloys e.g., as Te Ge, Te As Se and Bi Se have been suggested as of interest. Tellurium has been thought to exhibit a low write threshold energy e.g., when compared withAluminum as well as having a relatively low thermal diffusivity e.g., see U.S. 4,222,071 to Bell, et al also see 11Review of Optical Storage Media by Zech, SPIEVol. 177, Optical Information Storage, 1979, page 56 et sequ. and also see Optical Recording Media Review by Bartolini, page 2 et sequ. of 1977 SPIE Vol. 123, Optical Storage Materials and Methods . For instance, this Bartolini article discusses such absorber films Ablative Thin Films along with ten other optical recording means including Photopolymers , that is organic compounds known to undergo photochemical changes which involve a shift in refractive index. The Zech article discusses absorber films arranged and used so that with laser writing a pit is developed in the absorber layer, this information being detected according to differential reflectivity similarly for Bell patent . For such known deformational recording , it appears that the thermal energy delivered by a high intensity radiation beam Write Beam of a Laser is such that the write site will soften, melt or ablate, in at least part of the beam cross section. Many believe that surface tension then causes a transverse cavitation see article by Zech cited above , leading in turn to the formation of a pit or hole, usually slightly elliptical. See Melting Holes in Metal Films forReal Time, High Density Data Storage by Cochran andFerrier, SPIE Proceedings, August 1977, pages 17 31 . Absorber films As one feature hereof, I have discovered that a related kind of laser recording can be done at temperatures well below the melting point of such an absorber i.e., without heating the bit site to its bulk melting point . And, as a result I have also discovered that materials like gold, having a relatively high melting point and rather high thermal conductivity characteristics heretofore stunned by workers for the instant purposes can yield a surprisingly good absorber film one comparable in sensitivity to hitherto preferred absorbers like Tellurium. Of course, some have vaguely speculated that high melting point materials like Titanium and Cold also platinum, rhodium, nickel, chrom um, manganese and vanadium e.g., cf. U.S. 4,285,056 to Bell or IBM, TD Bulletin, March 71, page 3001 might be suitable for such deformation absorber layers. However, such speculations have paid no heed to the practical problem of sensitivity or to how a lower power laser can record on them as mentioned above. Or they have ignored the associated problem of high conductivity where heat is readily conducted away from the recording site, writeenergy is wasted, and sensitivity degraded note a metal like gold has a high thermal conductivity whereas Ti and Te do not . Observers have heretofore generally acknowledged that high melting point metals are quite unlikely as absorber candidates e.g., as expressed in cited U.S.4,222,071 where tho low melting poir.t and poor co lduWtixity of Te was heartily endorsed as yielding superior sensitivity and enabling one to record with a low power laser. Thus, metals such as Au, which are the REVERSE i.e., good heat conductors with high melting point, should, in theory, be the worst absorbers . Yet, the present invention teÅaches that just such metal as gold can be so used and can function at least as well as known absorbers e.g., having a sensitivity somewhat equivalent to Te, among with much superior archival life. This invention, further, teaches that such absorber films contrary to what is tal gh in the . rut evidently need not heat the bit site to tht classic bulk metal melting point tr recording. Extended archival life A major attraction of optical data storage technology is the increased storage capacity it promises e.g., the order of 100 X that of magnetic tape. An optical data disk as here contemplated will berassumed to store non erasable information thereon for an extended archival life on the order of 10 years cr more. Such extended life is a goal as yet unattained in the art, though workers would dearly love to do so.The present invention promises media exhibiting such archival life, being especially adapted for optical mass memory and like applications. By contrast, commonly suggested absorber metals like bismuth and tellurium are known to oxidize all too quickly and to otherwise readily degrade in the typical user environment hence, they are poor candidates for such archival records e.g., see cited article by Ash, et al. 1981 and Zech article also demonstrated byExample I below . Workers acknowledge that Tellurium has particularly poor archival stability i.e., its read out signal quickly degrades with time. This degradation is accelerated in a high humidity environment and is typically characterized by a rapid increase in overall optical transmission presumably caused by a general oxidation of the metal , as well as by severe attack on selected bit sites, beginning at defect sites in the metal film. And bismuth is similar. Extended archival stability is addressed by this invention which teaches the analogous use of absorber films of gold, etc. materials which are quite archival and are stable for extended use as computer information storage media, especially as for such optical data disk records for as in Table I computers. Thus, as a feature of novelty, I contemplate the use of such materials for records exhibiting extended archival life, i.e., being extremely resistant to oxidation or like environmental degradation, during typical EDP storage and use thus, no loss of recorded information occurring over extended, storage life, with reflectivity remaining stable enough to ready something no practical storage medium or associated system can yet provide especially where good sensitivity is also required. The invention teaches just this step forward. The novel recording media and associated deposition techniques taught herein will be generally assumed as meeting the foregoing criteria and, where possible, as also meeting one or more of the target performance criteria presented in Table I below. See also OpticalProperties of Tellurium Films Used for Data Recording by Ash and Allen, SPIE Proceedings, Vol. 222, 1980i Design and Production of Tellurium Optical Data Disks by Rancourt, SPIE Proceedings, 299, 1981 . TABLE I Target Criteria for Media 1. High Sensitivity allow recording by low power laser means. Sensitivity will be understood as minimum laser power needed for bit formation change in spot reflectivity, akin to that resulting from formation of a hole, or other void or like change in medium, giving adequate read out at contemplated recording rate . With the invention, one may typically write with the order of 5 15 mW laser power for approximately 40 60 n.sec. pulse duration , yet not degraded by read out i.e., on repeated playback . 1 A. High SIN adequate read out Signal to noise ratio for adequate read out on the order of about 3040 dB Min. peak signal to RMS noise. 2. Archival Stability 10 years life Able to be used or stored in normal computer environment without dropping below min. read out for about 10 years maintaining min. SIN . 3. Computer records Assume capability to operate with present day high speed digital computers e.g., with at least the same capabilities as today s magnetic disk storage equipment e.R., bit density of about 106 bits cm2 or etter Raw Bit Erroy Rate less than 10 6. 4. Deposit able suitable fiTm s can be deposited on commercial scale and give repeatable, controlled characteristics. 5. Overcoat ability absorber film can be super coated e.g., up to a few mils to mechanically protect it and defocus surface dirt without sacrificing above features,e.g., still give adequate read out preferably overcoat can also impede heat and contaminant gases, etc. from absorber film . Thus, it is an object hereof to provide the foregoing, and other related, features and advantages.A more particular object is to do so, teaching the deposition of gold and like absorber information films in island or like discontinuous form.Another object is to teach such films exhibiting good sensitivity, adequate for low power lasers as well as extended archival life. A further object is to teach preparation of such records which are suitable for recording without need td melt the information layer i.e., developing altered reflectivity bits pits while keeping the site well below its bulk melting temperature. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS These and other features and advantages of the present invention will be appreciated by workers as they become better understood by reference to the following detailed description of the present preferred embodiments, these being considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference symbols denote like elements FIG. 1 provides a cross sectional view of an idealized portion of a prior art recording medium, FIG. 2 provides a similar view of a novel preferred recording medium embodiment exhibiting a construction in accordance with principles of the present invention FIG. 3 is a similar view of a preferred disk record embodiment FIG. 4 is a plan idealized view of a certain recorded bit site FIG. 5 is a sectional view of another preferred embodiment FIG. 6 is a greatly enlarged plan schematic of a portion of another bit site written upon according to the invention FIG. 7 is a plot of Reflectance vs X for two emboliments, FIG. 8 is a plan schematic view, greatly enlarged of a portion of an alternate embodiment, FIG. 9 is a mechanical schematic of an alternate application of the invention and FIGS. 10, 11, 12 and 13 are TE micrographs of various embodiment films.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION 1,Te Example Tellurium absorber, Control FIG. 1 is a schematic illustration of an idealized cross sectional view of an optical recording medium 1, understood as fabricated and operated generally along the lines of what is presently taught in the literature for tellurium e.g., see Ash article . Medium 1 comprises a support 2 on which is provided an anti reflective baseAR and, on AR, an information layer absorber 5. Preferably base AR comprises a reflector layer 3, on which a transmissive spacer layer 4 is laid.Layers 3 and 4 may be characterized as, respectively, primarily reflective and primarily transmissive at the contemplated read write wavelengths. Layers 3, 4, 5 will be understood as providing a multi layer, lowreflecting anti reflection design over most of the visible spectrum as known in the art see Ash article . Preferably, reflector 3 is an opaque layer e.g., approx. 600 A found satisfactory of aluminum or the like, while spacer 4 is transparent fused silica, or a like transparent dielectric, approximately one quarter wavelength thick. i.e., N x X where N l,3,5,etc. . Support 2 preferably comprises a polished aluminum disk of the type presently used in digital magnetic recording for computer disk drives, coated with an organic smoothing subbing layer 2 S adapted to render a satisfactorily smooth, flat surface for deposition of reflector layer 3. This will be understood as preferably comprising a 14 disk to be operated at about 1800 to several thousand rpm with good surface smoothness e.g., order of less than 4 micro inches peak to peak . A radiation laser beam of prescribed energy and wavelength may be understood as applied to medium 1 from a laser source L, so as to establish a pit or like deformation on layer 5 as writing takes place e.g., at site v shown in phantom . More particularly, it will be desired to use a 10 mW µrussian beam with O diameter of 0.8 Um i.e., 8000 A or lI and scanning at 45 mlsec., to form a pit with a certain minimum length and width of 0.8 ijm though not necessarily circular or other prescribed shape, this requirement is too stringent for conventional means however . Prior art record 1 in FIG. 1 will be understood as undertaken and described principally to provide a means of comparison and distinction for the invention embodiments in the following examples. And, except as otherwise specified, all materials, methods and devices and apparatus herein will be understood as implemented by known expedients according to present good practice. Here, the metallic recording film 5 will be understood as deposited on the transparent dielectric spacer 4, with both thicknesses selected to yield a known low reflectivity structure e.g., in Bartolini article, less than 37. reflectivity obtained with 5 nm Ti on 80 nm SiO2 spacer recording at A 488 nm . Then, where each pit bit is recorded, this anti reflective background will be disrupted such as to yield bits adapted for high contrast read back. And, where the recording wavelength is shifted, the spacer thickness is readily altered to give like results.In this tri layer or Dark Mirror configuration surface reflectance on absorber 5 can be made zero or a selected value by adjusting absorber thickness and spacer thickness. A tri layer being here understood as comprising a transparent spacer with absorber on one face and reflectorson the other . Workers will recognize that in certain cases the reflector film may be eliminated e.g., in favor of a dielectric mirror and that spacer 4 may comprise other materialslstructures e.g., several layers of like material that is also more insulative thermally . Thus, the coating parameters here will be understood as selected to preferably provide an anti reflective condition for the so coated disk at the contemplated recording frequency when the write beam is focused on this absorber layer. Regarding such see Anti Reflection Structures for Optical Recording by Bell and Spong,Journal of Quantum Electronics, Vol. QE 14, No. 7, July, 1978 and for general prior art, see exemplary articles Optical Disk Systems Emerge , IEEE Spectrum by Bartolini, et al, August 1978, page 20 and Optical Recording MediaReview by Bartolini, SPIE Proceedings, Vol. 123, 1977, page 2 Optical Storage Materials and Methods , SPIEProceedings, Vol. 177, Optical Information Storage, 1979, page 56 . Preferably, deposition proceeds by thermal evaporation until the reflectance of layer 5 reaches a predetermined reflectance level. As workers know, this may be done empirically, or by continually monitoring the reflectance of the absorber film e.g., on a witness chip as layer 5 is. deposited see deposition techniques describe a by Zech in his cited article or by like suitable optical techniques for deposition monitoring or by other known methods, such as monitoring deposited mass or by electrical properties. Thus, one may vapor deposit an opaque layer 3 of aluminum onto coated disk 2 all optical characteristics taken relative to contemplated RIW laser spectrum of o 4000 9000 A . Then, a layer 4 of SiO2 fused silica or like transparent dielectric is vapor deposited on layer 5 to a prescribed thickness, this thickness related to B0, the operating wavelength here, may be slightly less than either k or 314 A0 . Atop layer 4 is vapordeposited the absorber film 5 to a thickness which produces the prescribed reflectance see below . The reflectivity of the record medium 1 will be understood as modified at each bit site v by the radiation beam from write laser L, so that, upon detection with a suitable means, the void areas v i.e., pits may be distinguished as relatively high reflectance spots from the low reflectance non void background surrounding them, as known in the art. For instance, U.S. 4,285,056 to Bell describes a like medium where information is recorded as openings in both the absorber and transmissive spacer layers, with the lengths of the openings and of the unexposed intervening areas being varied along a specific information track to convey frequency information. This patent also calls out various materials e.g., among them titanium, rhodium, platinum, gold, nickel, chromium, manganese and vanadium to be deposited using standard evaporation or electron beam evaporation techniques. By comparison, U.S. 4,183,094 to Keezer et al. calls for laser recording on Te Ge Se S materials to yield interference changes without creating such pits. However, Bell diverges from what is contemplated here in requiring that his spacer layer be heated by the write beam heated sufficiently to either be itself ablated away i.e., to otherwise develop a void within itself or else to be decomposed or sublimed and then out gas sufficient to cause a bubble lifting the super layer e.g., of gold in the present case, essentially no beam energy s to be absorbed by the analogous spacer layer. Tellurium is a low melting point poor conductivity metal commonly preferred by workers because it is felt to exhibit superior sensitivity, thus minimizing required threshold laser write power. For instance, this feeling is expressed in U.S.4,222,071 to Bell and Bartolini, where similar tellurium films were characterized as requiring laser power on the order of 15 mW for writing thereon to achieve adequate read out, about 20 optical efficiency being assumed the goal being to permit recovery of recorded video signals with about 40 50 dB SIN, or broadcast quality read back . They also specified a solid state Ga AL As injection laser, apparently applying a continuous beam about one 1 micron in diameter at the record surface, which is thewhile kept moving past this beam . U.S. 4,222,071 stresses that the absorber must be a low melting point metal like Te as well as being deposited in a continuous film , and not as microscopic agglomerates i.e., evidently not as islands or in insular form as below . Preparation of absorber layer 5 FIG. 1 Absorber layer 5 preferably comprises a relatively thin layer of tellurium which is vapor deposited thermally evaporated onto spacer layer 4 on a relatively flat lI2O A record surface thereof.The Te is so evaporated in a high vacuum preferably using a large batch coating chamber with corresponding large coating distances and double rotation of substrate, etc.to better ensure uniformity e.g., using a refractory metal boat for a source 1.2 m box type coating chamber used in Ash article3. All dust and stains on parts should be reduced to a strict minimum, using the most rigorous Clean Room techniques. Substrate 2 comprises a flat, aluminum plate polished to desirable flatness and coated with subbing 2 S to appropriate flatness to accommodate deposition of thin reflector layer 3 high reflectivity over at least the working portion of the contemplated radiation spectrum . About 600 900 A of aluminum prefer about o 600 A, vapor deposited has been found satisfactory.Since aluminum is not a perfect reflector, workers will recognize that in some cases one will substitute a multi layer dielectric stack or the like. The spacer 4 is likewise deposited atop reflector 3.Spacer 4 is a dielectric material which is relatively transparent to the working portion of the laser spectrum. oAbout 1583 A of vapor deposited SiO2 silicon dioxide has been found satisfactory for the subject purposes e.g., for writelread at A 6328 A . The tellurium absorber layer 5 will be understood as highly absorptive of the contemplated recording laser spectrum e.g., typically 25 absorptive 30 reflective with about 45 of the beam energy transmitted for trilayer cancellation, must transmit more than reflect . The thickness of absorptive layer 5 depends on that of spacer 4. Where transmitted light should be reduced, one may wish to increase spacer thickness in N x I4 periods also reducing heat loss possibly . Workers would view the Te absorber 5, with its low melting point and a relatively short thermal diffusion length poor conductivity as a good, high sensitivity material which helps conserve incident laser energy. When a write beam from laser source L falls upon site v of layer 5, a small portion of its energy will be reflected, a small portion absorbed and a large portion transmitted the transmitted portion being reflected back by layer 3 to be principally absorbed in layer 5.Hence both incident and reflected energy will heat film 5, minimizing transmission losses note deposition of 5 yielded a tri layer . Variations in absorber thickness or uniformity should be scrupulously avoided since this can reduce the write energy coupled into the absorbing film and degrade sensitivity. Results For present purposes, Sensitivity will be understood as characterizing the write energy Ew necessary to change reflectivity or a like read out characteristic sufficient to give the specified minimum read out. The intensity and time exposure of the focusedWrite Beam will be understood as sufficient to so elevate the temperature of absorber layer 5 as to cause the indicated change in reflectivity at v sites giving the desired read out quality, etc. e.g., so that adequate contrast, SIN ratio may be realized, as understood by workers in the art, cf. an exemplary SIN ratio of 40 50 dB peak to peak signal vs. RMS noise for a bandwidth of about 15 MHz. Here, test recording is to be performed with a gas He Ne laser beam operating at 6328 A, with recording exposure from 30 470 n.sec. usually 10 mW, 40 n.sec. or about 400 p.J. this intended to yield minimum adequate read out, or about 40 dB SIN, when read at lower power, e.g., viz 150 500 pJ cm2 pJ 10 12 watt sec. or Joules , with the same or similar laser equipment. Note for this contemplated setup, assume laser focused on bit site of 8 1 micron diameter, i.e., 5000 10000 A and thus a write pulse about 40 n.sec. long 60 n.sec. from rise to fall this also accommodating disk rpm of 1800 and associated galvo mirror focus characteristics . The subject record 1 is so recorded upon. It is found relating to comparable situations in the literature, etc. that relatively low power laser pulses can melt theTe film sufficient to yield the well known pits or craters and give good read out e.g., bit reflectance of 50 vs. background of 1 3Z at X 6328 A however with quite a bit of noise too. Such bit pits will be seen to constitute actual voids e.g., see photos in Ash article where 2 10 mW, 100 n.sec. laser pulse recorded such craters in like Te C films there, it was assumed that a 250 A film of Te used in the reflective mode produced 57 reflectance, 0 6 transmittance, 37Z absorptance at 4500 A . However, despite the fact that such Te films are deposited as a continuous layer, the formation of the bit pits v is described in the literature as accompanied by a surrounding rim and it is thought that this rim is responsible for much of the mentioned noise . Evidently one needs a certain MIN. Write Energy Ew within a certain minimum rise time e.g., with this laser etc. about 10 mW within 40 n.sec. to render adequate holes e.g., higher power delivered too slowly can allow heat at absorber to leak away thus no bit is written . Such holes or pits are suggested by the hole site at v in FIG. 1. At least some of the absorber material 5 is then evidently softened and displaced at that bit site, sufficient to reduce its thickness there and so give increased reflectivity at least that is what the art conventionally teaches, e.g., see Ash article and cited U.S. 4,222,071 . Such a spot may be read out with means known in the art e.g., with a similar laser at low power e.g., above described laser at 3 mW , the increase in reflected energy received at a suitable photo detector is observed to yield an output signal representing the recorded bits, these being readily distinguishable from background this read energy being insufficient to erase or disturb the so recorded bits, of course. Note read out at a frequency fR, where pit depth introduces a phase change vs. light reflected at surface of Te such as to maximize contrast therewith . Archival stability I found that the archival stability of this Te record was extremely poor, as the literature has noted e.g., see Ash article re oxidation, etc. . For instance, under known temperature humidity cycling, record 1 will be found using no overcoat on layer 5 to gain 50 of its reflectivity in about 2 3 weeks, evidently mostly via oxidation, etc. cf. a hole should have high relative reflectance oxide increases background reflectance between holes washing out necessary SIN . The Te film of Example I will be found characterized by a rapid increase in overall optical transmission after such aging . This is presumably caused by a general oxidation of the metal as well as severe selected site attack beginning at defect sites in the metal film, cf. analogous test per MIL SPEC 810 B . This is grossly inadequate for the mentioned archival memory requirements about 10 years exposure to normal computer operating storage conditions seeTable I . EMBODIMENT EXAMPLES The following Examples are given by way of teaching some exemplary uses and advantages of low temperature absorbers in island film form according to the invention. Advantages and features thereof will be better appreciated by comparing them with the TeExample described above. Example I absorber of gold material FIG. 2 The operations, materials, methods and structure of the Te Example FIG. 1 described above are repeated here, except as otherwise specified, in a novel record 10 FIG. 2 having a gold absorber film 15 replacing the tellurium film 5. Record 10 will be understood as comprising a support 12 on which an anti reflective base 1 AR is laid like AR in FIG. 1, preferably comprising a reflective layer 13, with a transmissive spacer layer 14 laid upon 13 , with absorber film 15 placed atop substrate 1 AR spacer 14 thereof . Here, and according to a feature hereof, absorber 15 comprises a film of gold material comprising an island layer deposited to function as an absorber film somewhat like the Te film in the Te Example , e.g. in a somewhat similar process and by similar means . Here, very close attention is paid, during deposition, to controlling absorber thickness so that it yields a prescribed minimal Dark Mirror reflectance Rm e.g., here 10 was chosen as further described below.Importantly, film 15 is formed to be discontinuous, being formed in an island configuration for optimal results, as shown in FIG. 11 100,000 x Te micrograph and as described below. The underlying spacer layer 14, reflector layer 13 and substrate 12 are at least functionally otherwise the same as in Te Example , and thus will be understood as functioning as a tri layer , with absorber 13, as understood in the art e.g., see cited references . Thus, gold absorber film 15 is preferably formed by vapor depositing a gold material on the surface ofSiO2 spacer 4 until monitoring the well known tri layer effect surface reflectivity of 5 first drops to preselected value Am 10X reflectance here , taking care to render the insular configuration. Reflectance Rm m may, conveniently, be set at any desired value consistant with adequate writing and read out. Here, about 10 was arbitrarily selected minimum for proper focusing, etc.of this laser and , somewhat surprising to discover, writing with the mentioned laser beam as in Te Ex. shifted reflectance enough to give adequate read out in the described manner i.e., a written spot may be seen to exhibit 25 5S reflectance, yielding the desired SIN in the 25 40 dB range in some cases a 30 50 increase is satisfactory . Workers will appreciate how other minimum reflectance values may be chosen for the virgin absorber film. Preparation of absorber layer 15, FIG. 2 Absorber layer 15 thus comprises an extremely thin island deposit of gold which is vaporrdeposited thermally evaporated onto spacer layer 14 i.e., on a relatively flat e.g., 0.5 A record surface thereof .Somewhat unexpectedly I found that if gold is so deposited on this tri layer coating only until such a minimum reflectance Rm as 10 , the islands are formed such that, when subjected to the described laser write beam 6338 A, 10 mW for 40 n.sec. etc. , reflectance quite desirably, yet wholly unexpectedly changes significantly quite enough for adequate read out e.g.. going from about 10 to about 25 55 see below for detailed discussion of Results . The absorber film 15 is thus preferably vacuum deposited on spacer layer 14 using present preferred techniques e.g., pure gold has been so deposited in large vacuum chamber at 10 6 10 7 Torr., from a molybdenum boat which was resistance heated deposition rate was about 5 10 A sec. . Preferably, the silica layer 14 was, itself, likewise vapor deposited before receiving the gold film 15. All substrates were cleaned according to present good practice for optical thin films. It is important that this deposition by thermal evaporation proceeds only until the reflectance of film 15 first attains the predetermined minimumreflectance level Rm yielding the desired islands otherwise the subject results may not occur. As workers know, this may be done empirically, or by continually monitoring the surface reflectance of a witness chip while absorber film 15 is deposited until satisfactory islands appear and see deposition techniques described by Zech in his cited article, or by other known methods, such as monitoring deposited mass or electrical properties during deposition . Results The results are most surprising, especially in light of expected properties and as compared with conventional media like the Te absorber prepared as abovedescribed in the Te Example . That is, record 10 was recorded upon, read out and evaluated, with its sensitivity, etc., measured, as in the Te Example e.g., using anHe Ne laser system of the type mentioned . The so written bit sites appear to be agglomerate holes where absorber has been made to agglomerate and where absorber material may also be caused to migrate toward the holeperiphery, or beyond this across a hole diameter comparable to that of the read beam e.g., X 3 4 thereof to exhibit a like increase in reflectance and higher output signal. FIG. 6 is an artistic rendering showing such an agglomerate hole or quasi pit as seen in photomicrographs of such records. Here an agglomerate hole 15p will be understood as a somewhat circular written spot, or physical optical discontinuity in the virgin unwritten absorber film 15v Spot 15p will be on the order of laser beam diameter te g , 40 120 thereof and may include a rim or partial rim about its periphery, Within the rim, relatively less absorber material is usually present, what there is will be seen as consolidated into absorber globs gL, most of which are relatively large e.g., usually fewer, many being larger than the tiny islands of virgin film 15v and FIG. 1, and lie relatively farther apart .In effect, spots 15 will be understood as constituting an p optical void or discontinuity at the selected readwavelength Xw whereas the virgin island film 15v appears as a relatively continuous partial reflector. Thus, workers will appreciate how such agglomerate holes 15 can be the functional equivalent of conventional p pits like those known with tellurium see Te Ex. and references cited . As detailed below, one finds that such an insular absorber film can yield a superior record one giving considerable archival stability, unexpectedly high sensitivity and high S N while requiring surprisingly low write energy, and low write temperature evidently and also apparently having good tolerance to an overcoat. E.g., where a useful overcoat doesn t degrade operational performance beyond practical usefulness as it presently does with Te absorbers, perhaps because these evidently require a relatively massive translation of absorber material in contradistinction, workers will be pleasantly surprised to note that the invention can record , i.e., open a bit hole to pass the Read beam, without necessarily so translating most or all of the absorber out of the bit site instead the invention can operate by merely agglomerating , and thus redistributing absorber within the bit site, with little or no material necessarily moved outside the site, or ablation ejected therebeyond, etc. . Details are given below. Island form of absorber film FIG. 11 is a microscopic plan view 100,000 x TE micrograph of the original,virgin i.e., unrecorded upon reflecting surface of an Au absorber film like that above described. It will be evident that this surface appears as a physically discontinuous, or partly discontinuous, insular configuration, exhibiting a fairly regular pattern semi islands on the 5i02 spacer .For this Ex. I, the islands will be understood as having diameters on the order of a few hundred A e.g., 100 300 A typical , separated by intervals of comparable dimension 0 0 e.g., 50 200 A apart vs. laser beam 5000 10,000 A wide 0 cf 6328 A wavelength . The virgin film 15 will thus exhibit a certain void range e.g., a few to 10 voids . Now, subjecting a portion of this virgin film to a laser recording beam as described acts to agglomerate these islands , increasing the percent void in the site larger island spacing and ejecting some island mass out to the site periphery and beyond, see ejecta e forming a small, not necessarily continuous rim there in some cases thus forming an agglomerate hole as in FIG. 6 this process is, here, loosely characterized as agglomeration . This island configuration was not expected yet more surprising were the unusual recording properties realized and effects which were quite different from what the properties of bulk gold would indicates As mentioned above, forming ODD absorber films into an island configuration is unmentioned in the literature moreover this is contrary to present good practice e.g., as U.S. 4,222,071 makes clear see above discussion . At least some of the first order factors controlling such island formation are absorber material, deposition rate, adhesion substrate material and condition e.g., cleaning, roughness, etc., and temperature presence of nucleation layer , presence of vapor contaminants vacuum pressure and like factors as will be appreciated by workers. For example, too cool a substrate will render a continuous film, but too hot will leave no film at all. In this regard workers may compare FIGS. 12 and 13 with referenced FIG. 11. InFIG. 12, a similar film was prepared like Ex. I except that the silica substrate was coated with a bismuth oxide layer for nucleation as known in the art.FIG. 13 was similar, with a chromium nucleation layer instead. Compared with FIG, 11, FIG. 12 seemed to exhibit thinner islands farther apart, while FIG. 13 is a continuous gold film no islands . The cited laser apparatus could not write at all on the film of FIG. 13 at cited power level , while the film of FIG. 12 wrote like that of FIG. 11 Ex. I except for a bit lower sensitivity. Workers will appreciate that such 1island pattern can render certain desired results taking into account such factors as read write conditions e.g., write energy, beam width, A, etc. . Thus. in Fx. I satisfactory bit holes about 4000 to 10,000 A diameter were formed with the specified write beam, etc. gave satisfactory SIN, etc. . One infers that island diameters which are either too large or too small will not be satisfactory. More particularly, it seems that the virgin size and spacing of the islands should be such as to accommodate the described agglomeration, upon recording, with average island diameter well below anything approaching a continuous film i.e., sufficient spacing percent void to thermally isolate individual islands yet large enough void low enough so that absorber film 15 appears like a relatively continuous optical reflector at selected x RIW lasers .And spacing is presumably large enough so that when a spot is laser heated written upon it will so agglomerate as to form the indicated agglomerate hole causing the film 15 to optically switch and exhibit a significant shift in detected reflectance consistent with required S N, etc. i.e., so the spot becomes relatively transparent now and appears relatively open transparent to the optical system concerned, as with a conventional pit . Stated otherwise, the write beam is assumed, here, to so affect the islands in a bit site as to cause agglomeration and the usually attendant increase in average island size and spacing increased 7o void area . One infers that the initial virgin void will be sufficient to aceommodate a prescribed minimal heat loss, radially, yet not so large that initial reflectance Ro exceeds the desired near zero value required for a Dark Mirror . Of course, where a tri layer is formed with its optical substrate, this will make the absorber spacerreflector effectively increase in reflectivity e.g., as here, from about 10 to about 30Z . In general, one may describe this writing operation as so energizing the absorber film as to, in effect, significantly separate absorber mass at the bit site.Thus where an unwritten spot may exhibit 25 absorption 45Z transmission 30 reflection, a so written spot may shift these values to about 30 10 60 , respectively, for the subject write wavelength tri layer . As this writing so increases the percent void area , one infers that the write beam evidently so energizes the islands at the write spot that their average size increases and their average spacing increases i.e., they agglomerate fewer islands . Island films as such Now, thin metallic films in island form have received some attention in the literature as a general proposition e.g., see article with this title by Doremus in J. App. Physics June 66, Vol. 37, 7, pp 2775 et sequ.where gold films were described also see OpticalConstants of Aggregated Gold Film by Truong, et al. inJournal of Optical Society Am. Vol. 66, 2, February 1976, pp 124 et sequ. where such films were formed by evaporating onto hot glass substrates at 3000 C, and wherein the authors opine it is reasonable to assume that the particles themselves have the bulk optical constants also see Structural and Electrical Properties of DiscontinuousGold Films on Glass by Andersson and Norman in Vacuum ,Vol. 27, 4, 1977, Pergamon Press, Great Britain studying electrical resistance of such films, indicating that this resistance exceeds that of the bulk gold . Yet no worker appears to have discovered that there is any advantage to using any such island films as anODD laser recording medium, whether of gold or any other metal. Indeed workers appear to have contemplated only continuous absorber films e.g., see cited U.S. 4,222,071 specifying that the absorber should not be agglomerated but should be a continuous film or see IBM TDB ofMarch 71, pp 3001 teaching a continuous metal layer such as gold plus an amorphous sub layer like amorphous silicon these layers to be heated to form a mixture of gold, crystalline silicon and amorphous silicon , etc. . It was quite accidental and fortuitous that I should so render such a minimum reflectance deposition onto a tri layer structure yielding such an insular absorber film. Otherwise I would have found no way to provide such ODD records exhibiting satisfactory sensitivity and SIN over a long service life see below . Now, as mentioned, such island absorber films seem rather strangely and unusually affected by a relatively low energy write pulse so that, without evidently being heated to gold s published melting point, the islands nevertheless spread and re agglomerate.This is not predicted by the literature Many workers have assumed that thin metal films would exhibit the properties of the bulk metal. A few have differed, opining that some properties none related to OD disk recording though may differ. Thus, a worker just could not be sure how such an island absorber film would perform in an OD disk context like that described . Workers will recognize how surprising it was that such island films could be laser written so as to generate such agglomerate holes . One might rather expectothat absorber film continuity was needed to so spread the softened material at the write site e.g., pull apart the pit site as the cited Zech article postulates surface tension causing a transverse cavitation , etc. . Archival stability resistance to environmental degradation was found to be superior to that of the tellurium record in the Te Example and to that of any known tellurium records . For instance, monitoring changes in optical reflectivity under aging tests under a cycled elevated temperature high humidity environment will indicate that this Au film is considerably more stable than closely similar tellurium films. Workers are well aware that gold films will be preferable to meet the stringent archival conditions specified here. ected ood sensitivit It was a great surprise that such a gold absorber could be reasonably sensitive as an absorber. That is, information can be satisfactorily written on the gold tri layer here in the power regime of 5 15 mW 10 100 n.sec. or 100 1000 p.J. . This is really astonishing it is many times the sensitivity level that theory predicted and is really contrary to what the literature teaches one to expect. That is, compared with known accepted good absorbers like Te, gold has such a relatively high bulk melting point about 10630C vs. about 4500C for Te and such superior heat conductivity that of Te is notoriously poor Au is among the best , that one would likely expect a gold absorber to exhibit practically no sensitivity at all, and to be far inferior to that of tellurium. For instance, the literature extols tellurium as having sensitivity which is vastly superior to titanium, and titanium has a high melting point like gold but is as poor a heat conductor as Te thus how can gold compare as an absorber e.g., Te has the lowest thermal conductivity of any metal, while gold s is about 100 x that of Te only Cu and Ag are more conductive . One reason see below may be that a different write mechanism for such bit formation or writing is involved a related reason may be the island form of the gold film as mentioned evidently requiring considerably less write energy than otherwise expected, or than the properties of bulk gold would indicate, to alter film reflectivity. Low temperature recording A major surprise is that the indicated reflectance transition occurs at such low write power levels and evidently at such low temperatures indications are that this occurs at about 300 C, well below gold s published melting point of 1063 C and corroborated by instances where the gold islands are deposited in a polymer and so recorded upon the polymer melting at well below this 1063 C see below Ex.s . This can allow workers to turn to a high melt material like gold for the absorber i.e., to a material which has superior archival properties, thus alleviating the risk of corrosion and like degradation over extended life. Of course, the island configuration of the film may account for this apparently reduced melting point, or it may trigger a write mechanism other than gross melting one is not yet sure. One theory is that such islands possess such high internal energy that relatively little write beam energy can trigger their bursting and so agglomerating, yet without necessarily melting them as such . In any event, workers will certainly welcome the availability of such novel gold absorbers because of their evident ease of manufacture, deposition and handling by well known methods plus their evident superior archival stability and aptness for use in computer disk records e.g., per Table I as well as because writing the usual transitions on gold brings special unique advantages e.g., evidently dispensing with need to heat the absorber bit site to the classic melt temperature . Also prized will be the associated reduction in write energy and record temperature all these promising the ability to laser write with much less energy and to write in smaller bit domains. For this reason, it is believed best if the spacer and any overcoat be a good thermal insulator with relatively low heat capacitance as further discussed below. Workers will welcome a system whereby bits are evidently recorded without the intense heat and macroscopic changes inherent in the weli known gross melting ablating of the absorber film, as with a Te absorber in the above described Te Example e.g., without any such massive translation of absorber material . Overcoating effects The Te Example was also run with a thin o overcoating of SiO 100 A, vapor deposited on the Te absorber film. This simulated an overcoat, but did not afford a true, functional overcoat of the kind workers would prefer like several mils of a transparent polymer to permit record handling without scratching, to defocus surface dust, grime, etc. to impede vapor entry, e.g. of water, oxygen to further conserve writing heat, etc. .But this SiO coat did affect pit formatiqn , raising required write energy to about double. Possibly because it so squeezed the Te film at the pit site as to impede associated displacement of Te material there . Workers have expected that such deformation recording as with pits in Te, bubbles in other metals, etc. would be resisted by any overcoat e.g., read out signal destroyed sensitivity raised the overcoat impeding, if not prohibiting absorber expulsion from the bit site and barring any eject of course . Significantly however, when a gold film like that of Example I was similarly over coated, little or no such resistance was evident and sensitivity was only slightly degraded further evidence that a different type of bit forming mechanism is at work. As workers will agree, this reinforces the theory that the instant recording mechanism is quite novel evidently whatever deformation and or movement of the island mass accompanies such low power writing of a bit , it is better tolerated by an overcoat, i.e., the overcoat presents less resistance to the writing mechanism this being consistent with the described agglomeration .This amplifies the attractiveness of such absorbers, since tolerance to overcoating is very, very important. Absence of Bulk Au properties As another feature hereof, and based on the foregoing Example I and others, one would infer that such an island film absorber of gold is not behaving as would be predicted from its reported Bulk gold properties e.g., radial conduction of heat. is not likely to be significant . The discovery of such insular film properties is significant and is further discussed below. It would appear that these agglomerate holes reflectivity switching are formed at temperatures well below the absorber s melting temperature of gold , that they involve little or no absorber expulsion and that so writing requires much less write energy. In general, workers may expect that such insular absorber films can be used to make OD disks as contemplated e.g., satisfying all or most of the requirements of Table I . Ex II as I, use Au Sn Ex. I is replicated except that instead of pure gold, the evaporo deposited absorber constitutes gold plus a minor concentration of tin. This is laid down as a laminate for convenience of deposition first gold, then tin, then gold alternatively, one can add other dual layers of tin and gold too . Upon heating, this laminate should inter diffuse to form mostly aAu Sn alloy mostly gold, so gold characteristics should predominate . This Au Sn film is substituted as the islandfilm of Ex. I for 15 in FIG. 2 and is similarly written upon. Effects were qualitatively similar to Ex. I, while exhibiting greatly superior archivability and somewhat inferior sensitivity. Adhesion of Au It was also observed that the gold islands adhered quite poorly to the cited silica e.g., easily wiped off .And, when a clear polymer spacer was substituted for better thermal isolation, etc. , the gold deposit would not really adhere at all zero sticking coefficient . Accordingly, a thin tin strike predeposit in island form see Ex III was conceived and applied as a nucleation film , and this was rendered on the glass followed by Au island deposit . Later a polymer spacer was used. As Ex. III shows the results were highly promising especially with the polymer substrate with the adhesion of gold vastly improved, but its island configuration not compromised apparently. EX. III Au on Sn flashlpolvmer FIG. 5 FIG. 5 depicts a replication of Ex. I, FIG. 2 , except that a clear polymer is used as spacer e.g.,Teflon and a tin flash strike , as adhesion promotor, etc. is interposed under the pure gold absorber. Thus, as before, we have a disk 212, a subbing layer 212 S on the disk, then a tri layer 2 AR consisting of reflector 213, clear Teflon or like polymer spacer 214 and absorber 15 pure Au, in island form, deposited however on Sn layer ST of islands . This was similarly written upon. RESULTS Like Ex. I but much improved gold adhesion, sensitivity, read out and archivability. That is, the gold islands adhered tightly to the substrate Sn islands on clear polymer spacer . Sensitivity and read out were much improved accordingly it is believed that this Sn strike not only improves adhesion to polymer but also cooperates to enhance the optical read out something very surprising. One such surprising optical effect is indicated inFIG. 7, a plot of wavelength vs. reflectance and index of refraction of virginal island films. A pure gold island absorber like that of Ex. I might exhibit a shift in refractive index as portrayed by curve A and a reflectancelX characteristic as in curve B. This obviously inhibits operating well above or below the oHe Ne laser spectrum 6338 A e.g., desired formatting of OD disks is not feasible at 4400 A, etc. alternate use ofGa As laser not feasible either . Quite surprisingly, adding the Sn island strike served to flatten the absorber s reflectivity curve as indicated at curve C.Workers will appreciate how significant such an increased radiation bandwidth can be. The archivability of Ex. I pure Au on Six2 leaves something to be desired e.g., in resisting intrusion of water vapor perhaps because of its very poor adhesion3 whereas this Au Sn island array was much better. Of course, the polymer is quite heat degradable accordingly the deposition steps for Sn, then Au will keep within its temperature limits 100 C Such gold films should be equal to the archival conditions specified here. It is projected that such gold records can maintain adequate read out 30 dB for the order of ten 10 years under typical contemplated storage and use conditions. EX IV as III with overcoat Ex. III is replicated, however adding a clear polymer supercoat on the absorber layer 15 as a protective overcoat. Results similar to Ex. III except that sensitivity is degraded a little, though is still passable. Such tolerance to overcoating is a noteworthy property much desired in the art. EX V as III, alloy co deposited Ex. III is replicated except that the tin is co deposited in same minor with the gold rather than as a preliminary strike . Results quite similar to Ex III. Ex. VI as III, SiO2 on polymer Ex. III is replicated except that a thin layer of SiO2 is superposed on the polymer spacer 214 FIG. 5 , with the Sn strike deposited on the 5i02 then the gold. Results comparable to Ex. III, but sensitivity reduced considerably. It will come as a surprise to workers that such polymer spacers are feasible and that silica is disfavored silica is widely reported as preferable . Ex. VII Au Sb Ex. VI is replicated except that antimony replaces the tin strike on SiO2 on polymer . Results superior sensitivity to foregoingExamples yet with very inferior archivability and, surprisingly more apt to form intra hole agglomerates and ring agglomerates see FIG. 4, elements i, r respectively than ejected globs see e, FIG. 4 relatively few ejecta e here e.g., vs. prior Examples FIG. 4 is an idealized showing of a typical agglomerate hole written on such an Au Sb absorber, the virgin island configuration v not shown here. The latter property tendency to favor ring and localized agglomerates rather than ejecta is striking it suggests a susceptibility for controlling the extent of agglomerate migration, and also suggests a hole forming mechanism likely to be minimally affected by overcoatings which can be expected to block all eject e . Co depositing such an AuJSb alloy same conc. will give comparable results. Ex. VIII AuISblSn Ex. III is replicated Sn striVe on polymer , except that an antimony strike follows the Sn strike, with gold deposited thereafter. Results quite similar to Ex. VII, with sensitivity a bit worse, archivability a bit better and the same general tendency toward minimal eject as in FIG. 4, but a bit more than Ex. VII .Co depositing the Au Sn Sb will yield the same kind of results. Ex. IX Pd Ex. I is replicated except that palladium replaces the gold and a clear polymer spacer is the substrate. Results quite similar to Ex I, and the same general dearth of ejects as in Examples VII and VIII with greater likelihood of rim agglomerates . Ex. X Pd Sn Ex III is replicated, with Pd replacing the gold however Pd deposited onto Sn strike on polymer . Results vs. Ex. IX, similar except superior archivability. Otherwise similar to Ex. III e.g., increased bandwidth, resist vapor intrusion and related dislocation of virginal Au islands, etc. . Ex. XI Au Pb laminate Ex II is replicated, except that tin is replaced by lead so the absorber film 15 FIG. 2 comprises successive island layers of gold lead gold lead gold, each in proper island configuration. when heated, these island layers will readily inter diffuse distances so short to form Au Pb alloy islands Au major constituent, so ignore Pb properties as a first approximation, i.e.thus alloy will exhibit gold characteristics predominantly . While film 15 is so deposited as a laminate for testing convenience, other methods will occur to workers. Note this laminar form of alloy is selected only for convenience of preparation and investigation however, once all alloy constraints are settled upon and optimized, workers will likely prefer to deposit by co evaporation , sputtering or other known reliable methods of high volume production, i.e., by a method yielding a more truly homogeneous alloy to the extent feasible. Such a laminar film may be somewhat suspect as to homogeneity, etc., and thus is non optimal for most applications. However, it is considerably quicker, cheaper and more convenient to set up on a first approximation basis e.g., vs. a co evaporation arrangement . Results generally like Ex. II, except that, rather than islands as described and shown in FIG. 11, etc. , a more filament like , semi discontinuous form is deposited this is shown in the 100 000 x TEM,FIG. 10 and, idealized, in FIG. 8 with a pair of spaced electrodes also shown. This quasi island insular or peninsular form seems to agglomerate in the described manner, forming globs which are more discontinuous uasi pits in the above described manner of Ex. I, etc., and thus is assumed functionally similar. However, these filamentary peninsulae exhibit a much lower electrical resistance laterally still quite high though than the islands of Ex. I, etc. yet since they function similarly to write an agglomerate hole it is assumed they retain much of the thermal isolation of the aforementioned islands .in common with the islands , such a filamentary configuratiof may also be characterized as insular . It records like the other insular films forming agglomerate holes . Sensitivity here was maximal better than with pure gold Ex. I e.g., approximately as sensitive as a tellurium absorber often better, e.g., about 4 the sensitivity of Te Example has been measured .That is, information can be satisfactorily written on the gold lead tri layer here in the power regime of 5 15 mW l0 l0O n.sec. or 100 1000 p.J. . More specifically, about 5 mW for as little as 40 n.sec. is seen to switch reflectivity . Some samples even switch in about 10 15 n.sec. at 1 2 mW others in less time at 10 mW all yielding satisfactory read out e.g., 30 40 dB S N, etc. . This is really astonishing it is many times the sensitivity level that theory predicted and is really contrary to what the literature teaches one to expect. However, archivability was very poor unacceptable for most purposes, as with pure Au and Au Sb . And, as with Au Sb relatively little ejecta is observed. Recapitulation Some results of Ex.s I XI are compared, rather loosely and qualitatively in Table II below here assume like structure and operating test conditions plus overcoating note S,y is sensitivity, A y is archivability Rim vs. eject denotes likelihood e.g., high, low of forming rims or ejecta 1 , 2 , etc. denotes best , second best , etc. relatively XX indicates not acceptable . TABLE II Au Au Sn Au Pb Au Sb AuISn sb Pd SnS y 40 50 10 20 30 40 A y 40 10 50 40 30 3o xx xx xx Rim Lo Lo Hi Hi Mod. Hi ejecta Hi Hi Lo Mod. Mod. Lo Thus, for instance, one general teaching hereof is that, in fashioning OD disks with an absorber film in tri layer configuration as described, one can achieve surprisingly good sensitivity by laying down the absorber material in island form. Beyond that, one is taught that noble metals like gold, palladium, etc. or their alloys may be so deposited as the absorber e.g., to enhance archival life while securing good sensitivity. Even more, one is taught that an island film absorber like gold can be combined with a co constituent like lead or antimony e.g., in a minor to enhance sensitivity, andlor with a co constituent like tin to enhance archivability and optical characteristics e.g., increased bandwidth . Further, one may to some degree control the hole forming agglomeration mechanism, e.g., to favor rim nodules on the one hand, or ejecta on the other by combining the gold or palladium, etc. with a co constituent e.g., Au plus Pb or Pd plus Sn minimizes likelihood of ejecta Au plus Sn and Sb to enhance S y, Aty, bandpass and reduce ejecta . Also, combining gold with lead, tin or antimony seems to improve its adhesion to substrate and help resist moisture intrusion at the absorberspacer interface, thus enhancing archivability. Other recording applications for such absorber films will occur to workers, such as for electron beam or IR recording. Heat opened shutter film FIG. 9 FIG. 9 schematically illustrates another application of the subject radiation agglomerated island films. Here an island film ab. is understood as deposited on a suitable substrate e.g., Au or Au alloy on glass, with clear polymer overcoat, similar to above Examples within a frame member f. A radiant energy source LS e.g., He Ne laser at 6338 A, suitable mW is understood as constantly or periodically directing an incident beam bi onto film ab. Initially, film ab is adapted to reflect most of beam bi e.g., as reflect beam br, toward a first detect unit D1 . However, when film ab beam impacted portion thereof is heated to pre set level by LS e.g., to agglomerate temperature such as by a fire, flames nearby, etc. it will agglomerate and clarify relative to Bi of bi so film ab now looks relatively transparent to i . Now ab will pass beam bi, as transmitted beam bt apt for detection at an associated second detect unit D2. Alternatively, source LS could be normally inactive, but upon first emitting energy, direct a portion as beam bi to unit D2 and thereby melt an aperture in film ab. Again, alternatively, beam b. could be scanned once across film ab to write a pattern therein whereupon, with b. inactivated, a source of backlighting illumination could be projected at the entire mask so etched e.g., to generate a display or an optical printing plate . Workers will contemplate other like applications. Variations Workers will appreciate that such island or YnsulaH films may comprise other metals or their alloys in certain cases e.g., other binary alloys of Au or Pd, ternary alloys, etc. or other metals such as Pt, Cu, Ag,Rh . In many instances, the absorber film will be advantageously combined in an anti reflection or like optical background array. Such island films may, in certain instances, be otherwise deposited, e.g., by other vapor deposition techniques vapor deposition is very practical where, as in Ex. I, etc., it may also be used to deposit other related layers such as the reflector, spacer, etc. .Vapor co deposition will usually be preferred for alloys . Other methods may be feasible for depositing the absorber, such as sputtering. In any event, it will usually be preferred to monitor the film during deposition to closely control the deposited island configuration.
