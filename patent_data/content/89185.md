# Dissolution of Pu02 or Np02 using electrolytically regenerated reagents.

## Abstract
A process is disclosed for dissolving PuO2, or nuclear reactor fuel containing PuO2 and or NpO2, in an aqueous medium containing nitric acid. The process comprises diectrolytically continuously maintaining and regenerating an oxidizing reagent, being at least one compound of Ce, Ag, Co or Am which is soluble in the said medium. The regenerable reagent may be added to the mixture of oxide s and nitric acid, or may already be present in situ as a fission product or other nuclear reaction product in irradiated nuclear reactor fuel.
