# Solvate of amoxicillin, process for the preparation thereof and process for the preparation of injectable preparations from this solvate.

## Abstract
The invention provides as a new substance the solvate of sodium amoxicillin with N methyl 2 pyrrolidone, which is a stable product from which injectable solutions can conve niently be produced. The invention also includes the preparation of the solvate by reacting amoxicillin with a solution of a source of sodium ions and subsequently causing the solvate to precipitate by addition of one or more organic solvents in the presence of N methyl 2 pyrrolidone. The invention further includes the preparation of inject able solutions from the solvate by generally known methods.
