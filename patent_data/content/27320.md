# Method for lower rate operation of blast furnace.

## Abstract
A blast furnace is operated by adding a prescribed vol ume of blast furnace gas to blast air before it is preheated in a hot stove. In the hot stove, CO and H₂ contained in the blast furnace gas are respectively oxidized to CO₂ and H₂O, and the blast is additionally heated by the above mentioned oxida tion. Blowing the resultant blast containing CO₂ and H₂O into a blast furnace through tuyeres thereof controls the heat output around the tuyere exits by the endothermic effect of the reac tions of CO₂ and H₂O in the blast with red hot coke in the blast furnace. By operating in this way it is possible to operate a blast furnace at a lower production rate than is usual, without bring ing about a deterioration in conditions inside the furnace, or to operate a furnace with a decreased, or even completely elimi nated, consumption of auxiliary fuel, such as heavy oil, also without deterioration in the furnace conditions.
