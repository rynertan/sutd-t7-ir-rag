# Stereophonic sound synthesizer.

## Abstract
A system is provided which synthesizes stereophonic sound by developing two separate sound channels from a single monophonic sound source. The system may be advantageously utilized in combination with a visual display such as a television receiver. A monaural signal M is applied as the input signal for a transfer function circuit of the form H s , which modulates the intensity of the monaural signal as a function of frequency. The intensity modulated H s signal is coupled to a reproducing loud speaker, and comprises one channel B of the synthetic stereo system. The H s signal is also coupled to one input of a differential amplifier 40 . The monaural signal M is coupled to the other input of the differential amplifier 40 to produce a difference signal M H s which is the comple ment of the H s signal. The difference signal is coupled to a second reproducing loudspeaker, which comprises the se cond channel C of the synthetic stereo system. When the stereo synthesizer is utilized as the sound reproducing system of a television receiver, the reproducing loudspea kers are located at oposite sides of the kinescope. The amplitude vs frequency response curves of the two output channels B, C are selected to have crossover points at which the amplitudes of the two response curves are equal, which effectively centers sounds at these frequencies be tween the loudspeakers. One crossover frequency is chosen to occur at approximately the frequency of peak intensity of the human voice, another to occur at the center frequency of the second articulation formant frequencies of the human voice so as to effectively center voices on the kine scope while preserving the ambience effect of other, more randomly distributed sound signals. Centering the second formant frequencies also provides increased quality in the reproduction of speech sounds.
