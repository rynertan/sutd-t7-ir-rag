# Restrictor apparatus for electrolyte recirculation flow.

## Abstract
In an electrolytic filter press cell having an electrolyte fluid circulated through anode and cathode frames, a cell frame at least partially supporting an anolyte disengager and a catholyte disengager, the disengagers having at least a first flow conduit and a second flow conduit in fluid flow communication with each electrode, there is provided a variable flow restrictor in the first flow conduit from the disengagers to each electrode frame to selectively vary the flow rate of electrolyte through the disengagers to thereby control the level of foaming of the electrolyte within the disengagers to optimize the amount of gas separated out therein.
