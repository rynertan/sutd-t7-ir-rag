# Centrifugation.

## Abstract
Centrifugation apparatus comprising a sample chamber, a deposit receiving surface such as a slide 3 and a filter card 1 having an aperture 4 adapted to define on that surface a deposition area communicating with the sample chamber is characterised by the feature that liquid flow paths in the filter card from the perimeter of the aperture 4 are selectively restricted in cross section so as to promote constant velocity flow of liquid, from the sample chamber into the card, in directions substantially normal to all points on the periphery of the aperture. This promotes uniform deposition of solids on the deposit receiving surface throughout the deposition area, to facilitate inspection of the deposit and, particularly, auto mated optical scanning of the deposit. The cross sectional restrictions may be accomplished by local removal of filter card material by local compression of the filter card or by local impregnation of the card material with an occlusive agent.
