## Description
The present invention concerns novel derivatives of thiadiazole compounds and their use as functional additives for oil based and water based lubricating compositions. More particularly the new thiadiazoles are derived from 2,5 dimercapto 1,3,4 thiadiazole and epoxy compounds. Additives known as antiwear agents are employed to increase the load carrying capacity of lubricants. The antiwear agents promote the formation of a surface film and thereby prevent wear of the contacting surfaces. During the course of use, lubricants are susceptible to deterioration due to oxidation. The oxidative process leads to the loss of lubricating properties and inadequate protection of the device to be lubricated. Antioxidants are added to inhibit the oxidative process. Thus, it is desirable that antiwear agents possess antioxidant properties. Prior art has disclosed certain thiadiazole type compounds and their use as lubricating additives. However, due to stricter environmental controls, there is a need to develop new and effective ashless type additives, preferably possessing multifunctional properties. No art is known that teaches or suggests the present compounds or their use as multifunctional lubricating additives. In accordance with the invention, there are provided novel reaction products of 2,5 dimercapto 1,3,4 thiadiazole and a substituted epoxy compound. The reaction products may be characterized by the structural formula wherein and groups Another aspect of the invention concerns oil based and water based compositions containing the novel reaction products in an amount sufficient to impart antiwear and antioxidant properties. US A 3 980 573 and EP A 0 166 696 disclose compounds presenting a close structural similarity and exhibiting an utility as multifunctional additives for oil based lubricants. The reaction products of the invention may be prepared by reacting 2,5 dimercapto 1,3,4 thiadiazole with two molar equivalents of an epoxy compound to form the corresponding alcohol derivative. Further novel reaction products may be formed from the alcohol derivative by reacting with an alcohol reactive functional group. Thus, esters may be formed by esterification with an organic acid or an equivalent thereof as for example organic acid halide or organic acid anhydride. Other products may be formed by reacting the alcohol derivative with an isocyanate compound. All of the hereinabove described products may be oxidized by known methods to form the corresponding sulfonyl and sulfinyl derivatives. The general reaction scheme is illustrated by the following equation wherein 2,5 dimercapto 1,3,4 thiadiazole is reacted with 2 moles of propylene oxide, as simple epoxide with A1 or A2 being hydrogen not covered to form the corresponding alcohol and then esterified with acetic anhydride. Preferably, the reaction with epoxides may be conducted in the presence of an inert solvent such as alcohols, toluene and benzene and a reaction promoter as for example tertiary amines. The reaction temperature will depend upon the specific reactants and solvent media employed. Typically reaction temperatures range from about 80 to 140 The reaction illustrated by the equation is the preferred method. Other methods of synthesis may be used. The groups A¹ and A² and R¹ and R² in formula I represent groups with 1 to 100 carbon atoms and a straight or branched chain. These include, among others, methyl, ethyl, n propyl, iso propyl, n butyl, iso butyl, sec butyl, pentyl, octyl, dodecyl, octadecyl, polymeric alkyl, 2 ethoxyethyl, dodecyloxymethyl and butoxymethyl. The alkyl groups A¹ and A² may bethe same or different. Similarly the alkyl groups R¹ and R² may be the same or different. The thiadiazole derivatives of the invention are useful as lubricating additives. The compounds possess multifunctional properties with respect to antiwear and oxidation inhibition. Although no particular theory is hereby relied on, the mercaptothiadiazoles are expected to be oxidized in performing the antioxidant role. These oxidized analogs still retain antiwear properties. Thus, the compounds are truly bifunctional. The thiadiazoles may be incorporated into lubricating compositions. Preferred are thiadiazole reaction products of formula I wherein the radicals contain from 1 to 75 carbon atoms and preferably from 1 to 50 carbon atoms. The lubricating compositions contemplated herein include lubricating oils and lubricating greases containing a major amount of petroleum hydrocabon and synthetic sources. The hydrocarbon base oil may be selected from naphthenic, aromatic, and paraffinic mineral oils. The synthetic oils may be selected from, among others, alkylene polymers, polysiloxanes, carboxylic acid esters and polyglycol ethers. Another lubricating composition useful herein includes waterbased systems. Typically the aqueous systems comprise at least 40 percent of water and zero to less than 15 percent of base oil. Oil soluble additives are incorporated in the system with the aid of solubilizer stabilizer systems. The water based systems are useful not only as lubricants, but also as functional fluids such as cutting oils, hydraulic fluids, and transmission fluids. The amount of the thiadiazole additive required to be effective for imparting antiwear and antioxidant characteristics in lubricating compositions may range from about 0.01 to 10 percent of the lubricating composition. The preferred range is about 0.1 to 5.0 percent of the additive of the total lubricating composition. The lubricating compositions may contain the necessary ingredients to prepare the composition as for example dispersing agents, emulsifiers and viscosity improvers. Greases may be prepared by addition of thickeners as for example salts and complexes of fatty acids, polyurea compounds, clays and quaternary ammonium bentonite. Depending on the intended use of the lubricant, other functional additives may be added to enhance a particular property of the lubricant. The lubricating compositions may further contain known antioxidants, extreme pressure agents, metal passivators, rust inhibitors and other antiwear agents.
