# Process for preparing substituted formamides.

## Abstract
Substituted formamides such as dimethyl formamide prepared by the catalytic oxidation of tertiary methyl amines, in which the catalyst is cupric chloride or other metal halide used in conjunction with an alkali metal halide or ammonium halide adjunct. The use of the adjunct increases the solubility of the corrosive catalyst in the reaction medium, reducing the corrosion effects of the process on reaction equipment, and can also enhance selectivity.
