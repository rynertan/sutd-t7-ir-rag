# Process for polymerization of butene 1.

## Abstract
An improved process for polymerizing butene 1 in the presence of a polymerization catalyst composed of a a catalyst component containing titanium and halogen as essential constituents and b an organometallic compound, wherein the improvement comprises bringing said catalyst component into contact with an activity inhibitor before said catalyst component is activated or after said catalyst compo nent has been activated with said organometallic compound, and subsequently polymerizing butene 1.
