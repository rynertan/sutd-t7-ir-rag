# Composite materials.

## Abstract
A method is described for the production of composite materials from layers of wood veneer and fibres bonded together and impregnated with resin. The method includes the steps of a impregnating at least one layer of reinforce ment fibres with a first resin, b coating surfaces of at least one layer of wood veneer with a second resin, c stacking the at least one resin impregnated reinforcement fibre layer with the at least one layer of resin coated wood veneer and d bonding the layers together under conditions of pressure and temperature appropriate to the resins employed in step a and step b to produce a laminate. Examples of composites are given using carbon fibres and hard wood veneers together with properties thereof.
