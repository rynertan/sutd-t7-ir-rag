# Method for preparing a low caloric spread having a relatively high content of milk fat.

## Abstract
A method for preparing a margarine having a fat content of a least 50 or preferably about 60 and having a high content of butter fat without admixing butter oil, whereby cream having a fat content of about 40 is cooled to a temperature of between 5 and 15 C and is stored at said temperature for a period of between 6 and 24 hours, whereafter the cream is subjected to a pressure of such strength that the cream emulsion is broken. The broken emulsion is heated to a temperature above the melting point of the butter fat and is mixed with margarine conventional ingredients and with cured and or uncured oils and or fats in such amount that the total fat content of the margarine to be prepared is 50 70 or preferably about 60 , whereby the amount of butter fat from the cream is between 42 and 100 of the total fat content of the margarine. The mixture is emulsified while maintaining the raised temperature by a vigorous mechanical working, for instance stirring, whereby a water in oil emulsion is formed. The emulsion is pasteur ized and is thereafter cooled and worked in a margarine and is packed for distribution or storing.

## Description
Method for Preparing a Low Caloric Spread Having a Relatively High Content of Milk Fat. The present invention generally relates to a method for preparing a low caloric spread in the meaning of a margarine prepared from milk fats and possible non milk fats and having a fat content substantially lower than the normal fat content for butter and margarine which is about 80 . More particularly the invention is directed to such a method for preparing a margarine or spread having about 60b fat content, and the process is special in that the low caloric spread can be prepared without the use of butter oil. In previously known methods for preparing low caloric spreads comprising butter fats butter oil usually is emulsified with proteins and different other additives. The preparation of butter oil is a relatively expensive and complicated process necessitating a special and complicated equipment which is often not available in many dairies. From manufacturina view point it should therefor be substantially advantageous if the low caloric spread could be prepared without the use of butter oil. since in such case there is no need for providing an expensive and complicated equipment. the relatively complicated process for preparing, handling, storing and packing butter oil is avoided.and at the same time the otherwise appearing problems in handling and taking care of by products from the butter oil preparation like butter milk are avoided. The object of the invention therefor is to solve the problem of providing a process for preparing a butter fat containing margarine or spread having a substantially lower fat content than the otherwise normal fat content of about 80 , preferably a margarine having between 50 and 70 or preferably about 60 fat content. whereby the process is run without the use of butter oil by utilizing such ordinary equipment which normally is available in the dairies. According to the invention the process is started by using ordinary cream having 40 fat content which cream after a certain temperature treatment is treated so that the cream emulsion is broken, whereupon the broken emulsion is heated to a certain temperature and is mixed with different ingredients and is emulsified to a water in oil emulsion having the intended final fat content, whereupon the emulsion thereby formed is pasteurized and is finally cooled and worked as conventional in a margarine machine and is packed. The method may be considered including 4 different preparation steps 1. The process is started using sweet cream having about 40S fat content. The cream is temperature treated by being cooled to about 50C and being stored at said temperature for a period of between 6 and 24 hours. During said storing time fat crystals are formed which make the subsequent breaking of the emulsion possible. 2. The temperature treated and stored cream is subjected to mechanical working giving the cream such a pressure that the emulsion is broken up. This can be made in that the cream. is forced through a pump subjecting the cream to such energy that the emulsion is broken up. The pump may for instance be a liquid ring pump of such type which is useful for foodstuff production.The breaking up of the cream emulsion is of critical importance for the subsequent preparation of the water in oil emulsion. It is of importance that a substantially exact amount of energy is supplied. A too little amount of energy does not give the intended breaking up of the emulsion and therefor does not give the intended result a too large amount of energy gives a product of butterlike character having about 40 fat, but which does not coincide with the type of product which is intended to be prepared. It is not possible to specifically state the amount of energy which has to be supplied, since the energy may vary from time to time, and since different types of pumps give different pressures and thereby different relative amount of energy. Generally it may, however, be mentioned that the cream ought to be subjected to a pressure of between 1.5 and 3 bar or preferably between 2.0 and 2.5 bar.Instead of using one liquid ring pump it is possible to use a liquid ring pump, for instance a MR pump manufactured by Alfa Laval AB, in combination with an emulsifying pump of the type having a choke valve or two MR pumps having choke valves. 3. In this step the cream with the now broken emulsion is worked. Most of the milk in the fat milk mixture is allowed to become drained to a water phase tank. The remaining part of the fat milk mixture is filled in a mantled tank having hot water heating. whereby the fat milk mixture is heated to a temperature above the melting point of the fat, for instance a temperature of between 35 and 400C. After the fat has melted the milk fat mixture is allowed to separate in a tank for 30 minutes, whereupon the milkpart is pumped over to the water phase tank. Salt, melting salts and possible water soluble aroma substances etc. are added to the water phase, and the water phase is tempered to 40 500C. It is also possible to heat the broken cream to 40 500C and to add salt and other water soluble substances. Also a slight amount of emulsifier and preferably colour substances and aroma substances are added to the fat. The separated butter fat is mixed with milk strange oils and or fats in such amount that the final fat content of the spread will be 50 70 or preferably about 60 . The milk strange oils and or fats may be palm oil, soy oil, colza oil, coconut oil and other cured and or non cured oils or mixtures thereof. Also fat soluble substances are added, for instance conventional colouring substances and possible aroma substances and emulsifiers. The fat phase is heated to 50 600C. The butter fat emanating from the original cream may be present in an amount of between 25 and 60 and the other oils and or fats added in this step may be present in amounts of from 35 to 0 when the total fat of the low caloric spread is 60 or a corresponding anount in spreads having fat contents down to 50 and up to 701 respectively. In a fat content emanating from the cream of less than about 252 for a 60 dairy spread there may be difficulties in breaking the cream emulsion and 25 animal fat content may in practice be considered the lowest limit possible for preparing the spread. The mixture of butter fat and oils and fats and other ingredients are emulsified as conventional together with a suitable amount of water phase by a vigorous mechanical working or in that the fat and water phases are forced through a dozing equipment and is thereafter subjected to a vigorous mechanical working, whereby directly a water in oil emulsion is obtained having a fat content of about 60 and whereby no by products in the form of butter milk or other products appear. 4. The water in oil emulsion now prepared is pasteurized on a scraper pasteurizing unit or on a tube heat exchanger or a plate heat exchanger at a temperature of 720C for 15 seconds or at a lower or higher temperature and corresponding longer and shorter time respectively. The pasteurized emulsion is then cooled and worked as conventional in a margarine machine for providing a smooth, soft product, and finally the ready product is packed and stored or is immediately distributed for sale. Now the invention will be described more closely in connection to a number of different forms of execution. For each example the real percentage of butter fat in relation to other fat and the relative content of butter fat in relation to other fat is stated within brackets. EXAMPLE I 42 182 1 70 30 1 butterfat other fat 100 kg cream having a fat content of 427 was cooled to 50C and was stored at said temperature for 18 hours thereby providing a crystallization of the fat. For breaking the emulsion of the stored cream the cream was pressed through a liquid ring pump giving the cream a pressure of about 2.5 bar. This pressure provided a breaking of the cream emulsion to the effect that the milk fat of the cream was released in the form of small fat balls. The milk the butter milk released from the fat balls was drained to a water phase tank. The total fat amount now was 42 kg. The cream was heated to 370C in a mantled tank by means of water having a temperature of about 600C. After the fat had melted it was allowed to stand for about 30 minutes whereby the fat separated from the milk. The milk was pumped over to the water phase tank. The melted animal fat was mixed both with an emulsifier of ordinary type in an amount of 0,7 kg and with a slight amount of a colouring substance betakaroten and also with 14 kg uncured soy oil and 3 kg uncured coconut oil, whereby the total fat content of the mixture was calculated to 60 .Parallelly therewith an amount of the water phase corresponding to 40 of the total weight of margarine to be prepared was taken out. 1 kg salt and a neglectable amount of butter aroma was solved in the water phase for giving the spread the expected taste, and the water phase was heated to about 450C. The water phase was addmixed in the liquid fat and the mixture was subjected to a vigorous mechanical working with maintained temperature of 370C, whereby the water phase and the fat directly was emulsified to a water in oil emulsion. The said wate in oil emulsion was pasteurized at 720C for 15 seconds, and with conventional working in a margarine machine it was cooled to 100C and was finally packed and stored for subsequent distribution. The ready spread had a fat content of 60 , 42 of which was butter fat from the original cream and 18 of which was milk strange fats. The spread had a good spreadability at refrigeration temperature and had a pleasent, butterlike taste and an attractive structure and consistency. The appearance and lustre of the product was similar to those of butter, and the product was juged to be of good quality. The spread was stored for at least two months after which no precipitation of liquid or proteins could be noted, and further no other change of character, appearance or taste and no bacterial affects could be observed. Depending on the high content of butter fat in the process there was an excess of 18 kg water phase which had to be drained as unuseful material. EXAMPLE II 50 10 1 83 17 1 butterfat other fat The process according to example 1 was repeated in that 125 kg cream having a fat content of 40 was cooled to 50C and was kept at this temperature for 12 hours thereby crystallizing the butter fat, whereupon the cream was pumped through a liquid ring pump having a choke means, whereby the cream obtained a pressure of about 2.5 bar. Thereby a mixture of fat balls in liquid was obtained. Slight difficulties in breaking the emulsion could be noted, the reason of which was thought to be that the storing time for the cream was too short. The liquid was drained to a water phase tank, whereas the cream from the broken emulsion was heated to 370C and was mixed with 0,7 kg emulsifier of the monoglycerid type and with 9,3 kg soy oil and a slight amount of butter aroma.40 kg of the water phase was used, and 1 kg salt was added to give the low caloric spread the intended taste. The mixture was emulsified, pasteurized and cooled and worked and was packed like in example 1. The ready margarine had a total fat content of 60 , 50 of which was milk fat emanating from the cream and 10 of which was milk strange fats. The margarine had a slightly harder consistency than the margarine according to example 1, but also in the present case the margarine was well spreadable at refrigeration temperature. As compared with the margarine according to example 1 it had a slightly more typical, good butter taste, and it had a good consistency, structure, colour and appearance and it had a good storability. About 30 kg of the water phase was unuseful material which was drained. EXAMPLE III 60 0 1 100 0 1 butterfat other fat The same method was repeated as in example 1 but with the difference that no milk strange fats were added. Thus the fat was received from 141 kg cream having a fat content of 42 which was stored at 50C for 20 hours whereupon the cream was pumped through a liquid ring pump like in example 1. The liquid was drained to a water phase tank for later use. The collected butter fat which gave a total fat amount of 59.2 Icg was mixed with 0,7 kg emulsifier and was heated like in example 1.The fat was emulsified with 40 kg of the previously drained butter milk in which 1 kg salt and a slight amount of colouring substance had been solved The low caloric spread thereby obtained and having 60 fat content had a good taste, aroma and structure, and the example illustrates that it is quite possible to prepare the margarine without the addition of milk strange fats. In order to obtain light butter having 60 fat an excess of 43 kg of the water phase, however, was obtained which had to be drained as useless material. EXAMPLE IV 30 30 1 50 50 1 butterfat other fat The same method was repeated as in example 1 in that 67 kg cream having a fat content of 45 corresponding to 30.1 of the total fat content was cooled to 150C and was kept at this temperature for 24 hours. After pressure treatment in a liquid ring pump the butter milk was drained and the butter fat was mixed with 4.2 kg palm oil, 10 kg coconut oil and 15 kg soy oil and 0.7 kg emulsifier. The mixture was heat treated like in example 1. It proved that the cream emulsion had not become broken and no water in oil emulsion was obtained. The reason was that the cooling temperature for the cream was too high and possibly that the storing time was to short. A storing time of more than 24 hours, however, is unsuitable for practical reasons, and the problems therefor are related only to the cooling temperature. Therefor it could be established that the cooling temperature had to be lower than 150C. EXAMPLE V 30 30 1 50 50 1 butterfat other fat For comparative reasons the test of example 4 was repeated with the same amount of cream having the same fat content. In this case the cream was cooled to 50C and was kept at this temperature for 24 hours, whereupon the cream was pressure treated and the milk part was drained to a water phase tank. The separated cream was mixed with 0.7 kg emulsifier of monoglycerid type, 4.2 kg palm oil, 10 kg coconut oil and 15 kg soy oil and was treated like in example 4. In order to obtain the intended fat content of 60 it was necessary, like in example 4, to use all of the drained milk, and in addition thereto 1.3 kg water had to be added. The water phase was given an addition of 1 kg salt and a slight amount of colouring substance in the form of betakaroten. The cream emulsion was easily broken in a single type liquid ring pump, and the margarine obtained had a good taste, consistency and structure. EXAMPLE VI 30 30 1 50 50 1 butterfat other fat In order to judge the influence of the storing time at the cooling treatment of the cream the following test were made with the same composition as in examples IV and V. The only difference was that the cream was cooled to 50C and was kept at this temperature for only 2 hours. It was shown that it was not possible to break the cream emulsion and this was depending on the fact that the storing time during the cooling treatment step was too short. EXAMPLE VII 32 28 1 53 36 1 butterfat other fat In order to investigate the lowest limit for the butter fat part when preparing the margarine according to the invention the following examples VII, VIII, IX and X were made. In the present example VII 69 kg cream having a fat content of 46 was cooled to 50C and was kept at this temperature for 24 hours, whereafter the cream was pressed through a liquid ring pump having a choke means in order to break the emulsion. The milk portion was transmitted to a water phase tank and was heated to about 450C.The separated milk fat was mixed with 0.75 kg emulsifier of monoglycerid type, 4.3 kg palm oil, 5 kg coconut oil and 19 kg soy oil and was heated to about 450C. All milk which had previously been drained was mixed in the fat portion, and in order to give the composition the intended fat content of 60 also 0.95 kg water was added. The ingredients were emulsified, pasteurized and cooled whereby a margarin was obtained which had a good taste, consistency and structure. In this case the milk fat amounted to 32 and the milk strange fats to 28 of the ready margarine. In this case there was no excess of butter milk. EXAMPLE VIII 26 34 1 43 57 milk fat other fat Example VII was repeated but for the difference that the process started with 65 kg cream having a fat content of 40 equivalent to 26 fat of the ready margarine, and in this case the milk fat was mixed with 0.7 kg emulsifier, 8.3 kg palm oil, 10 kg coconut oil and 15 kg soy oil. Also in this case a margarine was obtained which had a pleasant taste and a fine consistency, and no difficulties with breaking of the emulsion were noted. EXAMPLE IX 23 37 1 38 62 1 milk fat other fat In this example the process started with 60 kg cream having a fat content of 38 equivalent to 22.85 fat of the ready margarine, and the milk fat was mixed with 0.75 kg emulsifier, 12 kg palm oil, 10 kg coconut oil and 15.2 kg soy oil. Otherwise the process in this example was made like in example YIII. A slight difficulty in breaking the cream emulsion could be noted, but still the emulsion was broken as wanted and a margarine was obtained which had a good taste and consistency. Also in this case the cream did not give any excess of butter milk, on the contrary 0.95 kg water had to be added for controlling the fat content of the ready margarine to the intended fat content of 60 . EXAMPLE X 19 41t 1 32 68 1 milk fat other fat The same procedu as in example VII was repeated but for the difference that the process started with 55 kg cream having a fat content of 35 equivalent to 19 fat content of the ready margarine. The milk fat was mixed with 0.8 kg emulsifier, 12 kg palm oil, 10 kg coconut oil and 18 kg soy oil. In this case there were obvious difficulties in breaking the cream emulsion depending on the low fat content of the cream and the ready margarine got a low amount of milk fat. In this example it should have been necessary to add 3.1 kg water for controlling the fat content to the intended amount of 60 . EXAMPLE XI 30 30 ss 50 50 g butterfat other fat For judging the influence of the pressure when breaking the cream emulsion the following examples XI and XII were made. In both examples the procedure was the same as in example V and in both cases the cream was pressed through a liquid ring pump having a choke means. In the present example XI the choke means was adjusted so that the cream got a pressure of about 1.25 bar.It was shown that it was not possible at such low pressure to obtain the necessary breaking of the emulsion for preparing the margarine according to the invention. EXAMPLE XII 30 30 t 50 50 1 butterfat other fat In this example the choke means of the liquid ring pump was adjusted so that the cream obtained a pressure of about 3.5 bar. It was shown that a butter like mass having a soft, smeary consistency was obtained at this relatively high pressure, which mass was not useful for the subsequent manufacturing process according to the invention. In previous examples it had been observed that a pressure of about 2 2.5 bar gave a very good result, and now it could consequently be concluded that the pressure of the cream should be between 1.5 and 3.0 or preferably between 2 and 2.5 bar for breaking the cream emulsion. For determining whether or not the process is useful for other fat contents then the fat content of 60X as illustrated in the above examples two further examples XIII and IX were executed in which the total fat content of the margarine was 70 and 50 respectively. In example XIII, the 70 embodiment, the result was very good as expected and no difficulties whatsoever appeared in the process. On the contrary a slight difficulty in the emulsification step could be noted when executing the example XIV the 50 embodiment and it can be established that the method is not suited for use in industrial scale for fat contents less than 50 of the margarine. The above examples consequently show, that there are four different factors which are of importance, to give a good margarine, having more than 50 60 fat Content according to the described method, viz. the storing temperature and the storing period during the cooling treatment of the cream, the amount of butter fat in relation to other fats, and the pressure at the mechanical working causing the breaking of the cream emulsion. The above examples are listed in the following table TABLE 1 2Ex.
