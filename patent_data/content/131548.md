It consists of an engine casing picture j a with its relative tool box and a vane to store the electric wire V patent request n.31620 B83 6th June 1983 a cup picture 5 f , patent request n. 42006 A 83 6th June 1983,attachable to the engine casing a rotating clockwise and anticlokwise a lid picture 6 , patent request n. 42008 A 83, 6th June 1983, which rises when you open t,. and lowers sealing when you cloce it. At the sa me time it controls, through a can through an articulated Joi nt device, the switcher placed inside the engine casing blocoking at the same time the cup to the engine casing through a little cylinder made of steal. It consists of a series of attachment s 4ch allow different utilization of the applian ce The appliance is characterized by the fact that even if an induction engine is used, which has a single speed, it is possible to work every kind of food without changing speed and to obtain excellent results because it works at low speed without oxidi e the enzymes of proteins and vitamines contained in the foods This is possible through two peculiar devices that are the adjustable knife or blade picture 4 pa tent request n. 42005 J 83 6th June 3983, and the appliance for juices and pulp, picture 33 3 patent request n. 42009A 84 ist June 1984. The appliance is so charaterized by the adjustable knife through notches picture 4 j by the appliance for juices and pulp which works both with centrifugal force and with mechanic pressure effect picture 7 p and by the use of an induction engine long duration and great reliability which does not need different or variable speeds because the aims of this change of speed are obtained through the peculiar attachments used. 2 We can that to graduate the height of knife is, encreasing or decreasing the friction between knife and cup, to impress a more or less whiroling motion to the food minute parts. The device is charaterized by obtaining this result both through variation of the knife height, through motches, or through a screw regulation system O other devices such as different thiknesses which make it possible to place the knife at different heights or through the usage of different knives which have different heights between the cutting surface and the bottom of the cup. In fact the regulation and the followingEMI13.1 work at different heights might be obtained whith two or different knives, also made of different materials for example some of plastic , some of steal using that or those in the lower position to homogenize food or to whip cream, custard, white of eggs and those in the upper position to mince, cut, knead and mix 3 Appliance, as in claims 1 or 2 , whose device to elaborate juices and pulp is charaterized by a basket 1 with conic soaped walls upside down, that is a basket with conic sexton having the lower base larger than the upper one. 4 Appliance as in claims 1 2 3 charaterized by a device p on the lid z hand driven or with pneumatic or a electrical mechanic driving replaceable by a jet of air which allows through the continuous pressure against the basket walls 1 and the shaking of the mash which is being elaborated, to obtain, despite the low speed, the full exploitation of the juice and the pulp, owing to the combined action of the centrifugal and mechanic force. 5 Claims as in points 1 2 3 4 also in the case in which the appliance is made with expulsion devices for slags, juice and pulp, working continually or in an alternate way, both in the case in which the appliance is realized as an attachment of food processor and in the case which it is realized as a single electric or hand driven pppliance to squeeze juice out of various vegetables and fruits or as tomatoes strainer. 6 While usually the disk to grate or cut vegetables only worksEMI14.1 from one side, or if they from both sides they are blocked to the extension by screws or bolts, the disks of our new appliance are characterized by the possibility of being used from both sides through a quick coupling C which allows the disk to remain attached to the axle, owing to the blocking, both while appliance is running and while the electronical brake is used. The disks have same hubs y of different height in a way which the cutting surfaces are always at the same height compared to the lower rim of the feed box 1 the quick coupling made on an extension picture 3 ending with a polygonal staple, to make the disk rotate, has some couplers or on the outer wall of the extension in the innet side, or on the central peg of the extension. The quick coupling of the extension to the disk, is characterized by the different segments forming the central peg, which can expand and thighten, allowing the coupling on the hub of the disk. 7 The attachment of the food processor to make candy flow consists of a plate which produces by friction or a plate and a little resistance at low voltage. Both of therm are post sibily controlled by a thermostat. this attachment trasforms the food processor in a appliance to make candy flow. 8 The deviceto make spaghetti, doughs, bisquists ec. is characterized and consists of a drawing machine which works, that is coaxially to the gravity force. To allow this production, the appliance is to be inclined of 90 degrees and to be put the supporting base of the drawing machine T so as allow the part from which the drawn comes out, protrude from the supporting plane. 9 The attachment to clean ad polish kitchen tools and other tools is characterized by the possibility to attach to the engine casing a a flexible arm V also working in immersion. To its end are attached different tools such as brushes, disks, flannels, sponges, grinding wheels, which can rotate or work with alternating movement. 10 The device to be attached to be food processor to transform it in a grinding machine, to grind coffee, spices, dried fruits, sugar, corn, mais, other cereals ad vegetables is characterized by the absence of an engine because it works connected to the food processor one, and by its introduction inside the same food processor instead of the blade or the disks.

## Description
DESCRIPTIONElectric household appliance Food Processor to help the housewife to elaborate fooifflkakes, creams ect.The invention concerns a food processor to elaborate food.It consists of an engine , a tool box, a cup, a lid, a pestle with its lid and some attachments and tools, which are to be assembled inside the cup for different utilizationS such as 1 a rotary blade or knife 2 extensions to assemble the disks with the axle of the en gine 3 some disks to insert on the extensions 4 a basket and a different lid, with a peculiar device named appliance to squeeze juice and pulp out of food or fruit 5 an attachment to grind coffee, spices, sugar, corn, mais, dried fruits and any dried food which is to be ground and not minced 6 a device to make candy flow, melted through an electric resistance or through heath produced by friction.It consi sts of a central body to elaborate the sugar and a large container to be insert instead of the cup 7 a device to squeeze citrus fruits, consisting of a flange to be inserted in the place of the lid and of a central body turning very slowly owing to a speed reducer between the flange and the axle of the engine 8 a device to draw doughs. It consists of a cylinder with a suitable feed Box, within which a screw turn,, moved, throu gh, gears, by the axle of the engine and by a series of screw cutting dishes, placed to obstruct the end of the cy under toward which the screw works 9 a device to clean and polish kitchen tools, consisting of a flange to insert instead of the cup,and of a flexible tube, joined to the axle of the engine , ending with rotating tools such as flannel disks, brushes and tools wich have a different movement but always useful to clean, polish or dust.At present there are on the market some appliances, to help the housewife in the kitchen, ch use a single engine to put in action different devices, which have a single utilization and help the housewife to elaborate food. These appliances old fashion kitchen robots are for example mincer, grater, mixer, strainer ect.... everything put action by the same engine which is interchangeable. There are also some new robots food processor whose aim is that to have utilizations using a single engine and a single cup, changing the tools inside it.These food processorS use, at present, induction engines long duration and reliability at low speed and wi th one, maximum two speeds or charcoal engines which have the peculiarity of a high speed with the possibility of varin g it continually although the power is limited and they have short duration and low reliability. The present utilization of an induction motor, does not allow a food processor to use all the possible attachments , which need different speeds.On the other side the charcoal motor does not allow to exploit to the utmost all the attachments and it needs gears or belv ts or pulleys which endager its duration and its efficiency further on. Prom this we can say that a sudden rise isn technology would be a food processor with an induction engine, whits can elaborate any food and acts as a grater or a cream whipper indifferently , and fitted to exploit to the utmost every attachment,The aim of the present invention is that of eliminating the disavantages mentioned before, to improve the utilization of the existing attachments and create new ones which, at present, exist only as single machines.The advantage of the present invention is its need of a single speed this owing to the peculiarity of the rotary blade see patent request N.42005 A 83 6th June 1983 adjustable in a upper or lower position. In this way with a single speed, it is possible to knead blade in upper position or whip cream, mayonnese, eggs blade in lover position . in this way we can use an induction motor, varing the height of the blade instead ofEMI3.1 the speed. As far as the elaboration of any in general, it is not exposed to oxidation, because of the low speed. Now we are gong to analyze the various components also referring to the patents By which they protected in Italy. We also indi cate the numbers the patent requests.1 Engine casii3 and tool boa patent request n. 31620 83 6th June 1983 . At present there are an the market various kind of electtic household appliances which operate in a as settled way, but most of them have not got particular devices such as the vane to store the cable, inside the engine casing, and a tpOl box to store the tools, which is attached to the casing. The advantage of the vane is the possibility to store the whole live wire while the appliance. is not in use, or, during its usage , only part of it. The advantage of the tool box is a better harmony of shape of the appliance and the pos sibility to store, whithin reach the most used tools.2 Apparatus to squeeze juice and pulp or only entirely out of fruit and vegetables with separation of the slags patent request n. 42009 A 84ist June 1894 . At present we know various kind of little electric household appliances.whi ch squeeze out juice and pulp. These use different shapes of baskets at different speeds, for example a conic basket and 10.000 20.000 revs per minute or a cylindric one 1400 revs per minute, but they squeeze only some and not all the available juice from fruit and vegetables. In fact, as far as the centrifuge at high speed is concerned, owing to the sloping basket and the high speed, the pulp will stay on the basket for a relativelylshort time. So, even if the holes will not be filled with pap, only little juice and very little pulp will be squeezed out.Further more, owing to the high speed, the enzymes of the vitamines and proteins contained in the food to be elaborated will be oxidated. As far as machine with cylindric basket, working at low speed, is concerned, even in this case the juice and the pulp will not be squeezed out entirely, owing to the low speed and the long presence of the pup on the lateral sides of the basket The pap will infact fill the holes from which the juice should come out.In both cases the slags will be soaked with juice. The advar ntage of our apparatus to squeeze out juice and pulp is the particular device which allows to exploit the food entirely, leaving the slags completely dried. All this performed at low speea, which does not oxify the enzymes 4 the proteins and vitamines, leaving them integral Further more our appliance is so versatile as to be used as a strainer for tomatoes. 3 Cup patent request n. 42006 A 63 6th June 1983 and lid Patent request n. 42008 Ag83 6th June 1983 3.The dY ntage of our machine is that its cup can be connected or disconnected, turning both right or left. The cup and its lid remain hermetically sealed even if, owing to special dea vices, they can turn At present the other cups on the market are connected to the engine casing in various ways, such as bayonet joint or screw joint, but they can turn only in one ways Their lids can rotate and act as starters, but they can not seal hermetically, or they can seal, but just because they can not rotate they do not act as starters.We also add that, at the ignition, obtained through a cane which moves a plastic stick, carrying at its end a little metal cylinder, this cylinder moves the relay which starts the engine 4 System to clutch disks and extensions patent request n.42007 A 83 6th June 1983 . At present the disks on the market may have an extension which form a single body with them, and may be used for a single operation. One of the advantages of our quick clutching, as the title says, is that it becomes easier to change the disk because there is no need to useScrews, threadings,Bts ect. In this way, you need not put the disk on the extension with no blocking, which if it is possible in some food processor without istanteneous brake, would be impossible in our machine, which has an istantaneous electronic brakes Moving the brake, in fact, the not blocked disk would come off, Our device represents a great advantage in space and cost compared with the other disks with incorposated extensions, usable from one side only.We also remind the adavantage of a special device which is just in the cen ter of the disk and makes it possible to have at the same hei ght the cutting surface of the disk, when t is used from the opposit side, while a different thickness of the hub in every disk makes it possible to have the cutting surfaces of eves ry disk all at the same leyel. This makes it possible to work the food with the least waste.At present there is nothing similar on the market in fact even if there are disks usa ble from both sides, which present no different height between the cutting surfaces of the sides owing to a peculiar device, there is no device which makes it possible to have the cutting surfaces qt same height when you change disk. At present, in fact food processors leave, changing the disks , different distances between every disk and the endinq part of the fee d box, so if for example we assemble a disk to obtain 8mm thick potatoes and then we assemble a disk to grate cheese, there are 8mm of not grated cheese left.5 Apparatus to grind cereals, vegetables,coffee, dried fruits and any other dried food. There are different appliances to grind on the market. They consist of different patts and have small chances to diversify grinding. On the electrical household appliances market there are instruments to grind with little engines. The advantages of our attacHment are a greater power and a greater diameter of the grinding wheels, which allow to grind any vegetable or cereal in considerable quantity and in a relatively short time, using the same feed box of the food processor to put the food in and the same cup of the food processor as container, trasformiXng in thins way the food processor in a grinder of great capacity.6 Device to make candy flow. At present we only know quite beg machines difficult to be used and quite expansive. There is no electrical household appliance to make candy flow on the market. The self evident newness is that of using a food processor to make candy flow through melting the sugar with a resistance working at low voltage and so without any danger, or melting the sugar by friction and through. an electrical rasistance having in a little electrical hausehold appliance ce what is only possible with a specific industrial machines 7 The citrus fruits squeezing apparatus does not offer any advantage compared with the other appliances on the market and we quote it only to show the versatility of our applian ce.8 Attachments to draw. As far as the drawing machines on the market are concerned the household appliances can only make a horizontal drawn daugh. The great advantage of our attachment is that of working industrially, making a vertical drawn daugh, without the deformation due to the force of gravity which is unovoidable in the horizontal drawn daugh. In our apparatus the drawn daugh comes out coaxially to the force of gravity, it is not subject to any deformation and allows to work softer doughs such as daughs with vegetables etc. With our device it is not only possible to have very long drawn doughs but also it is possible to draw doughs which need not to be very hard it is so possible to obtaw very thin spaghetti.9 Attachment to polish and clean kitchen tools and other tools. At present even it there are polishing machines forshoes, industrial machines to polish with emery and vacuum cleaners they are not household appliances. In fact there is not any little polishing machine which can be used various ways at home. Our device consists of a flange to be put in the place of the cups In the middle of the flange there is a rotating and flexible arm to which it is possible to attav ch different tools. The advantage of our attachment is that it is possible both to drysclean polishing furniture, shoes ect. and to clean with detergent foams. It is possible to work in immersione to clean cookery, dishes, pottery etc. Another tmportant advantage is the interchangeability of the tools in fact to the end of the flexible arm it is possible to attach both disks made of brushes or flannel and tools which move with an alternate movement, The food processor is in this way transformed in a new and different appliance,Now we will follow a progressive order to indicate at least one of the different ways of using the various inventions, referring to the pictures.1 We will explain the operating directions of a little hou sehold appliance see picture 1 . composed of an outer casi ng the engine a with its axle sloping to the supporting base. In the casing there is vane to store the electric cable and a tool box k , which can be attached or disattached to it, where the tools are to be stored an eletrical induction engine powerful enough to fulfill every function it is useld for our disks b made of non toxic material, each of them usable from both sides owing to the particular kind of coupler c male femalert with suitable shapings and dimensions as you can see in picture 2 and 3 a knife ox rotary blade d as described in picture 4. It can be placed in two or th e positions through the notoches j which are within its suE port, corrisponing to the one on the motor axle c a cup f see picture 5, in plastic material, with the suitable shape of a conic section and possibly constructed with little lip alpha if you want dotated of a gate valve or similar device which allow when you use the cup to squeeze out juice and pulp, as it will be described later, the continual pouring of the worked product between the handle y and the cup there is a suitable device J which is both to block the cup, and to start the engine Xt blocks the cup penetrating with q suitable stake, made of steal for example , into a cor risponding clutch made in the upper side of the casing of the food processor It starts the engine switching a suitable cos trol g j which is on the lid see picture 6 to be put on the cups The cup may be attached disattached indifferently from the right or from the left owing to the pecuMat kind of attach h corrisponding to the one existing on the base 1 of the food processor, in the casing a of the engine furthermore the cup has shape, in the upper lip, which follows the developing of a single ellixis, or more tracts of elli xis ,ss , which starting from O level reach the hemicir cunference at X ii level to pass quickly at O level again and gradually reach X level at 1 80 degrees. On these hemi circunferences some supporting planes gamma ss having different heights and placed along the lid arm see picture 6 3 to al low the lid to go down, if moved in one sense, and go up if moved the other way round.At the same time they allow the lid to remain during its rotation 3 parallel to the cup ba se in picture 5 on which it is attached . On this lid the re is a feed box 1 through which the food is introduced, and a funnel m through which fluids are poured. In the fee dbox 1 there is, if you need to press the food to be worked into the cup, a dosing pestle n 2 Now we are going to describe the appliance to squeeze juice or pulp or only juice fully out, with separation of the fully exploited slags. It consists of a cup F see picture 13 and 5 , the same used for the normal operations of the food processor to knead, to mince, to grate ect. 3 and a lid see picture 3 containing a real new device p 3 which if moved by a suitable notch q 3 in a way by which it re sults tangent to the sense of movement, obtains the machanic pressure of the mash previously crumbled by the disk r which is metallic or not, attached to lateral sides of the gasket s 3 in Picture 8 .Further more the lid see pic EMI9.1 ture 7 3 has the same sealing closure between itsel the cup in picture 5 13 obtained through the suitable supporting planes at different heights and through the development of a hemicircunference moved of 180 degrees, on the rim of the cup.From the holes in the lateral sides of the basket come out both juice and pulp, this obtained thanks to a powerful pyxes sure made by the p device. If it is driven in the opposi te sense that is incident to the sense of movement, owing to its peculiar, helicoidal shape, it makes the mash convey to the center of the basket and toward the bottom instead of toward the top. Moving the p device with repeated and alternated movements, you will obtain the coming cut of all the juice and pulp. Through one or more springs made of material which has an elastic strain, you can assure yourself about the rest position of the device , when it is not moved. At last on this lid there is a feed box z to introduce the food with its pestle to press the food on the disk r at the bottom of the basket see picture 8 .Now we are going to describe an appliance to grind cereals, vegetables, coffee, dried fruits and any dried food see picture 9 . It is composed of a cup compare 5 and a device divided in various parts 1 grinding wheel A attached to a support B to insert in the motor axle e i 2 Nut c with a stop device which takes place in the cy linder, in which the support b 3 of the grinding wheel A turns The support has Been attached to the motor axle and has a threading on the outer surface.3 tunnel E with, in the inside base, a grinding wheel F opposit to the rotating wheel A It is possible to regular te the distance between them through the thraading existing between C vnd E . In the funnel there are same fissu EMI10.1 res possibly , which make the grinder product pour in the cup. Now we are going tb describe an appliance to make candy flow picture 30 It consists of a support H where the re are two electric poles, if you want to use the electric resistance L , controlled by a thermo ewitch to melt sugar, and of a friction disk attached to the container N which alone, by thermo switch, or with elettric resistance L makes sugar melt in the suitable rotating basket with fissures and at the same time it ejects the sugar making it flow. Now we are going to describe the appliance to draw doughs see picture 11 . It consists of the engine casing a on which is attached the device P which allows to use the motor in a position inclinad 90 degrees compared to a normal position. The movement is trasmitted to the reducer Q which trasmits it to the Archimedean screw R which conveys the dough, introduced in the feed box S towards the screw cutting dies T . Now we are going to describe the appliance to cleam and polish see picture 12 . This device consists of the engine casing a of a flange U which is attached in the place of the cup and which carries in the middle, a fle bible arm V to whose end are attached the tools , such as a flannel disk Z .
