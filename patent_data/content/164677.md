# Speech synthesis system.

## Abstract
A speech synthesis system comprising input means for receiving frames of speech data, said frames of speech data comprising binary representations of speech determinative data. Interpolation means are coupled to said input means for interpolating between adjacent frames of said speech data. Further synthesizer means are coupled to said input means and to said interpolation means for selectively con verting said speech data and interpolated values thereof into signals representative of human speech. Means are coupled to said synthesizer means for producing audible sound. The frames of speech data as received by said input means in clude coded frame rate data. Decoding means are coupled to said input means for decoding said frame rate data. The interpolation means are also coupled to said decoding means for providing a variable number of interpolation calculations between adjacent frames of speech data. The variable num ber of interpolation calculations being directly related to said frame rate data. The speech synthesis system may be con structed by employing metal insulator semiconductor tech nology so as to provide circuits capable of low voltage operation.
