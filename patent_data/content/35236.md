# Tracking servo control device.

## Abstract
A single laser beam emitted from a laser generator 12 driven by a laser driver 14 in a record mode is alter nately switched between a recording beam with large pow er and a tracking beam with small power. The beam switched is focused onto an optical disc 42 through a laser beam transmitting section 30 and then is reflected from the optical disc 42 . The reflected laser beam from the optical disc is received by a pair of photo detecting elements 72, 74 in a two divided way. Pulsate signal com ponents with peaks corresponding to the recording beam contained in the output signals produced from the photo detecting elements 72, 74 are removed by sample hold circuits 88, 90 in a wave shaping section 80 . A level dif ference between the output signals from the wave shaping section 80 is detected by a differential amplifier 130 . The output signal TC from a differential amplifier 130 , that is, a tracking control signal, drives a drive section 132 to move an optical head 82 .
