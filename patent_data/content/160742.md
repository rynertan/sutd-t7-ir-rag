# Slope etch of polyimide.

## Abstract
A slope via through polyimide 13 between metal layers 111 is achieved by first sloping a hard mask 14 which overlies the polyimide. Sloped photoresist 15 overlying the hard mask 14 transfers the slope to the hard mask 14 . The slope hard mask 14 is used to slope the polyimide 13 . Oxide 12 underlying the polyimide 13 is also etched to expose the metal 11 . The underlying oxide layer 12 can be subsequently slope etched.
