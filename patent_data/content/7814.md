# Manufacture of extruded products.

## Abstract
A molecularly oriented two part extrusion is made by extruding a second part 7 into thermal and mechanical engagement with a first part 3 already extruded, cooled and advanced at a speed restricted by a gripping device 5 . The product is taken up at a higher speed, to effect elongation. At least one of the parts is of a crystallisable polymeric material, and elongation takes place at a point between the extruder 6 and the take up where, as a result of cooling of the second part and or the concurrent heating of the first, it is at a tempera ture between its glass transistion temperature between its crystalline melting point. Both parts may be of crystallisable polymeric material and at such a temperature when elonga tion takes place. They may be inner and outer layers drawn down during elongation onto a wire or other core.
