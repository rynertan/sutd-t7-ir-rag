## Description
PICTURE TRANSMITTING INTERCOM APPARATUS FOR WALL MOUNTED INSTALLATIONS, HAVING IMPROVED FASTENING MEANS ANDA CIRCUITRY LAID ON COMPACT SIZE MOULDED SUPPORTS This invention relates to picture transmitting intercom apparatus, and more precisely to an apparatus it tended for wall mounted installations, of the type corn prising a container with a visual monitor, a handset and related hooking contacts, and at least one. door opener Push button. Current intercom apparatus of the type indicated are provided with a support intended for attachment to a wall, which simultaneously serves as a bottom for the contained and a support for the circuitry and monitor kinescope. This known arrangement of parts has many disadvantages, and primarily considerable laboriousity of installation, difficulty of intervention for replacement and or maintenance purposes, and larger overall dimensions of the apparatus. This invention is directed to remove these drawbacks, and is essentially aimed at providing an apparatus equipped with improved fastening means adapted to significantly facilitate the installation operations for which, in particular, dismantling of the apparatus is no longer required, nor is the prior installation of bushings or walled boxes of special design. Another object of the invention is to significantly simplify the composition and arrangement of the supports for the circuit components that simplification being directed to facilitate the interventions of replacement and or maintenance of the apparatus and reduce the space requirements with self evident aesthetic advantages as well as improved functionality and convenience of use. To achieve these objects, as well as others which will be apparent from the detailed description that follows, this invention has for its subject matter a picture transmitting intercom apparatus characterized by the following combination and arrangement of parts a container box incorporating the visual monitor and a support for the circuitry, said box being completed by a cover forming a removable bottom intended to cooperate, for supporting the apparatus, with a plate.previously secured to the wall a plate support, advantageously made of metal, which may be permanently secured to the wall and carries a multipole connector adapted to cooperate, in mutual connection relationship, with a similar complementary connector carried on the circuitry support and passed through a window in the removable bottom removable fastening means for quick connection between said box bottom and support plate the distribution of the system wiring being accomplished by means of an embedded box of a known standard type as mployed for embedding switches and the like in common domestic electrical supply systems. According to the invention moreover, the support for the circuitry of the apparatus is composed of a single printed circuit board configured as a right dihedral, which is arranged with one face parallel to one side of the box and the other parallel to the bottom. On the parallel face to the side, there is formed a connector intended for cooperation, in mutual connection relationship, with the mating connector of the support plate. Formed through the bottom face is a window for allowing the base of the kinescope therethrough, which is supported on the front face of the box. That base is protected by a deep drawn housing provided on the box removable bottom and protruding inwards of the embedded box. Further features and advantages will become apparent from the following detailed description, with reference to the accompanying drawings, where Figure 1 is an exploded perspective view of the front side of the intercom apparatus aooordig to this invention Figure 2 is a similar exploded perspective view of the rear side of the apparatus Figure 3 is a perspective view showing in detail the support plate attachable to the wall, and its related embedded box for distributing the wiring of the intercom apparatus. In the drawings, 10 designates the parallelepipedal container box on the front face whereof there is formed a center window 11 for the kinescope 12 of the visual monitor the box is provided laterally with seats 1314 for holding the handset 15, with which a finger 16 actuating the hook contacts cooperates, in a manner known per se. The box, which carries the kinescope 12 fixedly secured thereto, is closed rearwardly by a cover forming a removable bottom 17 which is held fast by means of screws engaging with corresponding threaded seats in the box, thereby the bottom cannot be separated from the box by acting on the front side of the latter. Formed in the removable bottom 17 is a deep drawn seat 18 for containing the base of the kinescope a side window 19, a series of five locating slots 20, of which four are located at the vertices of the bottom and one centrally, a center retaining latch rod 21, and a rear groove 22, the functions whereof will be discussed hereinafter. The removable bottom 17 is intended to cooperate for holding the apparatus with a support plate 23 wherewith the whole apparatus, including the box 10 and bottom 17, is removably mounted. The support plate 23 is intended for permanent connection to the wall, advantageously by means of expansion plugs, and has a center opening 24 wherethrough the space is accessible for an embedded box 25 of a known type employed in electric supply systems for domestic networks. Led to the embedded box 25 are the cables of the intercom system the terminals whereof are soldered to a female connector 26 carried on the support plate 23 and located beside the opening 24. Also formed on the plate 24 are four retaining and centering fins 27 intended for cooperation with the corresponding locating slots 20 in the bottom 17 a center lug 28 formed with a throughgoing slot adapted to reeeive the latch rod 21, and a locating rib 29 mating with the groove 22 in the bottom 17. As clearly shown in the figure, the components of the apparatus s circuitry is carried on a printed circuit board 30 configured as a right dihedral, which accomodates on its interior the box 10 with one face parallel to one side of the box itself and the other parallel to the bottom 17. Formed on the side face of said dihedral plate is a male connector 31 which, being passed through the side window 19 in the bottom 17, is brought into mutual connection engagement with the connector 26 of the support plate 23 on securing the apparatus to the latter. An opening is formed in the bottom face of the printed circuit wherethrough the base of the kinescope 12 is passed to fit in the deep drawn seat 18 of the bottom 17. The apparatus is preliminarily fully assembled, and the installation provides for connection of the support plate 23 to the wall and connection of the system leads to the connector 26 of said plate. Then, the pre assembled apparatus is connected to the plate by interconnecting the conneotore 31 26 fitting the finns 27 and lug 28 into the seats 20 of the bottom, and the latch rod 21 into the slot of the center lug 28. Of course, the effects of the present model extend to those models which can achieve comparable utility on the basis of the same inventive concept.
