# Apparatus for determining the degree of variation of a feature in a region of an image that is divided into discrete picture elements.

## Abstract
The invention concerns an apparatus for determining the degree of variation of a feature in a region of an image that is divided into discrete picture elements, said feature being rep resented by complex valued signals, one for each picture element, the signal phase representing the feature type and the signal amplitude representing the certainty in the feature asssertion. The apparatus includes a unit 3 for providing the complex valued signals 8 within the region and complex valued multiplication factor signals 9 corresponding to said signals. In a first summation unit 4 , a first sum signal is generated by the magnitude products of the signals 8 and corresponding multiplication factor signals 9 , and a second sum signal is generated by the complex valued scalar pro ducts of the signals 8 and corresponding complex conjugate multiplication factor signals. In a second summation unit 5 , a third sum signal is generated by the signals 8 that are weighted with the magnitude of corresponding multiplication factor signals 9 , and a fourth sum signal is generated by the complex conjugate multiplication factor signals 9 weighted with a magnitude of corresponding signals 8 . A norming unit 6 is provided for norming the output signals from the sum mation units in a predetermined way.
