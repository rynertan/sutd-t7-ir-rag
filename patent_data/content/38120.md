# MAGNETIC ROTARY PRIME MOVER

## Abstract
A magnetic rotary prime mover has a flange shaped rotary plate 25 securely fixed to an output shaft 23 rotatably supported on a frame. Planetary gears 29 are rotors consisting of magnets 41 are securely fixed to a number of planetary shafts arranged in a circle and mu tually engage and rotate while engaging with a statio nary gear 27 securely fixed on the frame, and a plura lity of pairs of magnetic stators 43a, 43b, 45a, 45b for providing rotational torque are disposed around the re spective rotors so that the total rotational torque of the respective rotors is applied to the output shaft through the rotary plate.
