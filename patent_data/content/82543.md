# Phonorecord cleaner.

## Abstract
A phonorecord cleaner 10 is comprised of a handle member 24 journalled for relative rotational movement with a phonorecord contact member 26 , the latter including a phonorecord contact face having a wiping surface 76 which is substantially equal to the radial dimension of the grooved recording band of a phonorecord 12 , wherein movement of the cleaner 10 in an arcuate path corresponding generally to the orientation of the spiral groove pattern maintains uniform contact of the wiping surface 76 across the recording band of the phonorecord 12 . A positioning member 28 is preferably included to center the cleaner 10 over the recording band and maintain proper orientation of the wiping surface 76 with respect thereto during the cleaning operation.
