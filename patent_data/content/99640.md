## Description
CROSS LINKED POLYETHYLENE INSULATED CABLES FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to electric wires or cables. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Electric wires or cables having dielectric layers of polyolefins such as polyethylene, cross linked polyethylene and the like are in wide use. Such polymers have in recent years been improved so that they are able to withstandftigh applied voltages. One important problem at present with such electric wires and cables is that they undergo a gradual degradation with time under continuous applied voltages, resulting in a reduction in their capability to withstand applied voltages.Since the service life of electric wires or cables per se is as long as thirty years, the initial thickness of such dielectric layers thus must be increased over their initial requirements to compensate for the above reduction in their ability to withstand applied voltages with the passage of time. On the other hand, recent urban developments have required increased power transmission capacity for electric wires or cables while keeping the volume thereof as small as possible. This has led to the problem, with electric wires or cables having a dielectric layer consisting essentially of a polyolefin, of increasing transmission voltage without increasing the thickness of the dielectric layer. It is generally believed that the degradation referred to above results from the formation of water trees in a cross linked polyolefin insulation. Various approaches to overcome the above problem have been considered, including preventing the occurrence of the above degradation, whereby the decrease in capability to withstand applied voltages during a thirty year service life need not be taken into account, and the requirements of urban areas regarding high transmission capability and low volume can be met. For example, improved cables or cable joints are described in Japanese Patent Publication No.89322 74, Japanese Utility Model Publication No.29008 74, and Japanese Patent Publication No. 51180 81.In these cables or joints a polyethylene composition with an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer compounded therewith is used as an insulating material, whereby resistance against degradation has been improved to a certain extent. Recently, however, it has been discovered that whencross linked polyethylene cables, particularly those cables covered with an insulating material, are used at high temperatures e.g., 900C for long periods of time, they are seriously degraded. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The inventors, taking note of the above points, performed extensive research on the aging of electric wires or cables of the foregoing type, and found that aging is primarily caused by trees or electrochemical trees, as they are sometimes termed generated in the polyolefin dielectric from voids which develop in the polyolefin dielectric material, that many trees from voids generate especially at high temperature such as 9O0C, and that the degradation described above can be avoided by preventing the generation of trees from the voids in dielectric polyolefin material, and one can significantly decrease the thickness of the dielectric layer. A primary object o the present invention is thus to provide electric wires or cables in which the development of trees especially at high temperature is prevented and longer service life is obtained. Another object of the present invention is to provide a cross linked polyethylene insulated cable which is prepared by extruding a polyethylene composition onto a conductor, the polyethylene composition comprising polyethylene, more than 10 to less than 30 by weight of an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer hereinafter referred to as EVA having a vinyl acetate hereinafter ref erred to as VA content of more than 25 to less than 35 by weight and an organic peroxide, and thereafter corss linking the thus extruded polyethylene composition. The percentage showing the amount of theEVA is based on the total amount of the polyethylene and the EVA. By the use of the electric wires or cables of the present invention, the disadvantages of the prior art are overcome in that the development of trees is prevented, to thereby provide a service life several to several tens times as long as that of a conventional polyolefin dielectric insulated wire or cable. As a result, we succeeded in significantly decreasing the initial thickness required of the polyolefin dielectric layer in such wires or cables. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING The Figure is a cross sectional view of a cross linked polyethylene cable. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Preferred range of melt index of the polyethylene used in the present invention is about 0.5 to about 10, and that of the EVA is about 0.3 to about 100. The VA content of the ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer as used herein is preferably from 28 to 33 by. weight, more preferably 30 by weight. Organic peroxides which can be employed in the present invention include conventional organic peroxide cross linking agents for a polyethylene. Preferable examples of the organic peroxides are dicumyl peroxide, di tert butyl peroxide and 2,5 dimethyl 2,5 dittert butyl peroxy hexane. The amount of the organic peroxide is not limited, but is preferably about 1 to about 7 by weight based on the total amount of the polyethylene and the EVA. The polyethylene composition used in the present invention may further contain antioxidant such as 4,4 thiobis 3 methyl 6 tert butylphenol In the cross linked polyethylene insulated cables of the present invention, the degree of crosslinking is not limited but is preferably about 60 to about 95 . The present invention will hereinafter be explained in detail by reference to the following examples and comparative examples. Cross linked polyethylene insulated cables 140 mm2, 60 kV class were produced using the compositions shown in Table 1. The Figure shows a cross sectional view of each cross linked polyethylene cable comprising a conductor I, an insulating layer 2, an inner semiconductive layer 3 and an outer semiconductive layer 4. The insulating layer 2 is formed from a polyethylene EVA composition of Table 1 and the semiconductive layers 3 and 4 are each made ofNUC 0580 trade name, produced by Nippon Unicar Co.,Ltd. . NUC 0580 comprises EVA containing carbon, dicumyl peroxide and antioxidant. The thickness of the insulating layer 2 is llmm, that of the inner semiconductive layer 3 is 0.8mm and that of the outer semiconductive layer is 0.8mm. A current was circulated which makes the temperature of the conductor to 90 C and the voltage of 160 kV was applied.The time to breakdown the cable of application of voltage was measured to evaluate degradation of the cable at high temperature. These times are hereinafter referred to as the breakdown time , and are shown inTable I with the breakdown time 334 hours ofComparative Example 1 as a base 1 .The following can be seen from Table 1.With cables produced using compositions in which 20 EVA having a VA content of 15 or 25 , respectively, were compounded with polyethylene Comparative Examples 1 and 2 , the resistance to degradation at high temperatures was slightly improved as compared with the cable of Comparative Example 1, but it was not satisfactorily improved to the extent that a long service life e.g., 30 years could be guaranteed. On the other hand, when EVA having a VA content of more than 25 was used Example 1 , degradation at high temperature was greatly improved. In particular, when the VA content was 30 Example 2 , the cable showed a very high resistance against degradation.Also, at a VA content of 33 , excellent characteristics were obtained. However, when the VA content was further increased, e.g., EVA having a VA content of 35 was used Comparative Examples 4 and 5 , the characteristics of the resulting cables were slightly improved as compared with the cable of Comparative Example 1, but they were not satisfactory.

The above densities were all measured at a temperature of 20 C.M.I. was measured at a temperature of 190 C under a weight of 2,160 g. The amount of EVA having a VA content falling within the above described range which is compounded with the polyethylene is critical in the present inven tion With a cable produced using a composition in which the same EVA as was used in Example 3 is used, but the amount of the EVA. compounded is 40 or higher as inComparative Example 5, the resistance to degradation is slightly superior to that of Comparative Example 1, but the same is not improved satisfactorily. The same is the case with Comparative Example 7. Conversely, when the same EVA as was used in Example 3 is used, but the amount of the EVA compounded is 10 or less, as can be seen from Comparative Example 6, the resistance against degradation is not satisfactory. On the other hand, cables produced using compositions in which EVA having a VA content falling within the above described range, i.e., EVA having a VA content of 15 Example 4 and EVA having a VA content of 25 Example 5 , is compounded with polyethylene, show excellent resistance against degradation. As can be seen from the results shown inTable 1, only when the compositions of the invention comprising polyethylene and EVA are used as insulating materials, are there obtained cables having excellent characteristics. While the invention has been described in detail and with reference to specific embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope thereof.
