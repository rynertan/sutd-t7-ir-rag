# Conveying and like structures.

## Abstract
A link conveyor is proposed which includes a first set of helical coils or spirals 5 connected together in interdi gitated parallel disposition to define a base structure pro viding adequate strength and dimensional stability in the conveyor and a second set of interdigitated helical coils or spirals 6 connected together and to the base structure and forming a supplementary structure for protecting the said base structure against damage or undue wear. The base and supplementary structures may be arranged to form a single layer conveyor of may comprise two separate piles connected together by support coils 7 to define a Duplex structure. The conveyor is of particular application to papermachine clothing suitable for dryer fabrics, forming fabrics and base structures for press felts.
