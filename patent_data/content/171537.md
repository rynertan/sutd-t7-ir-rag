# Method for producing glass preform for optical fiber.

## Abstract
A method for producing a glass preform 1 comprising flame hydrolyzing a glass raw material in an oxyhydrogen flame to form glass fine particles of quartz, depositing the glass fine particles on a seed member to produce a solid or hollow cylindrical soot preform 1 at least of a part of which contains GeOâ‚‚, and heating and sintering the soot preform 1 by introducing it in an atmosphere comprising an inert gas 6 at least a part of which is kept at a temperate not lower than 1,600 C at an introducing rate not smaller than 3 mm min, from the glass preform produced by which method, an optical fiber having longitudinally homogeneous composition and low attenuation of light transmission can be fabricated.
