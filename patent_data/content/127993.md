# Soldering fluxes and their production processes.

## Abstract
The soldering flux of this invention containing a chemical reaction product precipitated when at least one member selected from normally liquid brominated aliphatic hydrocar bons is mixed with a least one member selected from the group consisting of normally liquid amino group containing aromatic hydrocarbons and normally liquid amino group containing aliphatic hydrocarbons can not only solder stain less steel or nickel chromium alloys whose soldering has heretofore been thought impossible, but also does not cor rode the soldered metallic material after soldering, has a higher electric insulation resistivity necessary for the soldered areas of parts of electronic and electric devices and appliances, markedly reduces defects due to poor soldering, and can secure a high reliability of soldered joints as com pared with conventional fluxes.
