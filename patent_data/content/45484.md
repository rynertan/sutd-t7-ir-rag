# An electric sewing machine driving apparatus.

## Abstract
An electric sewing machine driving apparatus includes a clutch coil 3 of an electromagnetic clutch for transmitting a driving motor torque to a sewing machine, a brake coil 4 of an electromagnetic brake for braking the sewing machine, a needle position signal generator 13 for generating a signal indicative of a position where a needle of the sewing machine is to stop, a DC power supply 1, 2, D₁ D₄, C₁ for energizing the clutch coil and the brake coil, voltage generating means 7, Q₅, D₁₁ for generating a DC voltage higher than the supply voltage of the DC power supply and a capacitor C₂ disposed to be charged by the voltage generated by the voltage generating means, whereby an electric charge stored in the capacitor C₂ discharges through the brake coil 4 in response to the needle position signal from the needle position signal generator 13 , thereby improving the needle positioning accuracy of the sewing machine.
