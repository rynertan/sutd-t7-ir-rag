## Description
The present invention relates to a multiple output type stabilizing power source apparatus for generating stabilized AC and DC voltages. A typical conventional multiple output type stabilizing power source apparatus as shown in Fig. 4 supplies a stabilized DC voltage to a DC load such as electronic equipment and a stabilized AC voltage to an AC load such as a fluorescent lamp. Referring to Fig. 4, the stabilizing power source apparatus has inverters at the primary and secondary winding sides. A reference symbol V₀ denotes a DC voltage Q₁, a switching transistor and T₁, an inverter transformer. The inverter transformer T₁ has a primary winding N A reference symbol A₁ denotes a differential amplifier for comparing a reference voltage V A reference symbol INV denotes an inverter for receiving the DC voltage V₁ from the secondary winding N It should be noted that a resistor R In the conventional stabilizing power source apparatus having the structure described above, a rectangular wave current obtained upon switching of the transistor Q₁ is rectified by the diodes D₁ and D₂ connected to the secondary winding N The DC output V₁ is supplied to the differential amplifier A₁ and is compared with the reference input voltage V In the pulse width modulator PM , the triangular wave from the oscillator OSC is converted to the pulses of the same frequency as that of the triangular wave. In this case, the pulse width is varied in accordance with the crossing point between the leading ramp of the triangular wave and the output from the differential amplifier A₁. The pulse is amplified by the driver DR, and the amplified pulse is supplied to the base of the transistor Q₁. The duty factor of the transistor Q₁ is thus controlled in response to the output from the differential amplifier A₁. Therefore, the DC voltage V₁ is kept constant. On the other hand, the stabilized DC output V₁ is supplied to the inverter INV and is converted to the AC voltage upon its switching. The AC voltage is boosted by the transformer T₂. The boosted voltage is then smoothed by the capacitor C When the AC load R In the conventional stabilizing power source apparatus, however, since the switching circuits are arranged at the primary and secondary sides of the transformer, the circuit arrangement is complicated. Furthermore, since the rectangular wave voltage is supplied to the primary winding N In the conventional apparatus of this type, a large line filter must be inserted at the input side to reduce such noise. It is also known from Radio Fernsehen Electronik vol 30, No 6, 1981, page 403, to provide a stabilizing power source apparatus having first and second DC output voltages. This stabilizing power source apparatus has a transformer having a primary winding, a direct current being input to the primary winding via a switching device, the transformer having first and second secondary windings. A first rectification smoothing circuit is connected across the first secondary winding and provides the first DC output voltage and second rectification smoothing circuit is connected across the second secondary winding and provides the second DC output voltage. A first differential amplifier compares a first reference voltage with the first DC output voltage and generates a first differential signal according to a difference between the first DC output voltage and that first reference signal. A second differential amplifier compares a second reference voltage with the second DC output voltage and generates a second differential signal according to the difference between the second DC output voltage and the second reference voltage. The second differential signal is used to control the frequency of an oscillator, the output of which is supplied to a pulse width modulator. The output width of the pulse is the pulse width modulator is controlled by the first differential signal. The output of the pulse width modulator is applied, via a driver, to the switching device. It is another object of the present invention to provide a stabilizing power source apparatus which has a simple circuit structure and low manufacturing cost. According to the present invention, there is provided a stabilizing power source apparatus having a DC output voltage and an AC output voltage comprising a transformer having a primary winding, a direct current being input to said primary winding via a switching device, said transformer having first and second secondary windings, a rectification smoothing circuit connected across said first secondary winding and providing said DC output voltage, a resonance circuit which connects said second secondary winding to an AC load and outputs said AC output voltage to said AC load, a first differential amplifier for comparing a first reference voltage with said DC output voltage and for generating a first differential signal according to a difference between said DC output voltage and said first reference voltage, a resistor for providing an output voltage representative of the current flowing through said AC load, a second differential amplifier for comparing a second reference voltage with the output voltage of said resistor and for generating a second differential signal according to the difference between said output voltage of said resistor and said second reference voltage, a pulse modulator which is connected to the outputs of the first and second differential amplifiers and which produces a pulse train whose pulse width and frequency are varied in accordance with said first differential signal and said second differential signal, the duty factor of the pulse train being varied to maintain the DC output voltage constant and the frequency of the pulse train being varied to maintain the AC load current constant, and a driver for controlling said switching element in accordance with the output signal of said pulse modulator. Embodiments of this invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings Fig. 1 is a circuit diagram of a stabilizing power source apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention. The same reference numerals as in Fig. 4 denote the same parts in Fig. 1. Referring to Fig. 1, a reference symbol V₀ denotes an input DC voltage Q₁, a switching element and T₃, an inverter transformer. The inverter transformer T₃ has a primary winding N Reference symbols D₁ and D₂ denote rectifying diodes for the secondary winding N A reference symbol A₁ denotes a differential amplifier for comparing a reference input voltage V In the stabilizing power source apparatus having the arrangement described above, the duty factor of the transistor Q₁ is controlled to keep the DC output voltage V₁ constant. At the same time, the switching frequency of the transistor Q₁ is controlled to keep the AC load current constant. The operation of the stabilizing power source apparatus will be described in detail hereinafter. Fig. 2 is a graph showing the relationship between input impedance Z and frequency When the AC load R However, when the AC load R The input impedance Z is given by Fig. 3 is a circuit diagram of the oscillator OSC in the apparatus in Fig. 1. Referring to Fig. 3, reference symbols R₁₁ to R₁₇ denote resistors C₁₁ and C₁₂, capacitors Q₁₁ to Q₁₃, transistors IC₁, an integrated circuit element as a timer circuit and IC₂, an integrated circuit element as a NAND gate. In the oscillator OSC described above, the timer circuit IC₁ generates a clock signal with a period T at an output terminal OUT thereof so as to charge the capacitor C₁₁ in accordance with a time constant determined by the resistance of the resistor R₁₅ and the capacitance of the capacitor C₁₁, and at the same time, discharge the capacitor C₁₁ in accordance with a time constant determined by the resistance of the resistor R₁₇ and the capacitance of the capacitor C₁₁. The clock signal is supplied to the base of the transistor Q₁₃ through the NAND gate IC₂, so that the triangular wave voltage appears across the capacitor C₁₂ upon ON OFF operation of the transistor Q₁₃. The triangular wave voltage signal is supplied from the collector of the transistor Q₁₃ to the pulse modulator PM. When the AC voltage V₂ is constant and the signal from the differential amplifier A₂ is the reference voltage value, the transistor Q₁₁ is turned off. The timer circuit IC₁ generates the clock signal of a predetermined frequency. However, when the AC output V₂ is decreased and then the signal voltage from the differential amplifier A₂ is decreased, the internal resistance of the transistor Q₁₁ is decreased and the charge rate of the capacitor C₁₁ is increased. As a result, the period T of the clock signal is shortened. Upon shortening of the period T, the internal resistance of the transistor Q₁₂ is decreased to increase the charge rate of the capacitor C₁₂. The leading ramp of the triangular wave becomes steep. However, when the AC output V₂ is increased, the leading ramp of the triangular wave becomes moderate in the reverse process. The frequency of the oscillator OSC varies in accordance with variations in the output signal from the differential amplifier A₂ which, in turn, varies in accordance with variations in that AC output load current. In the pulse modulator PM, the width and frequency of the pulse supplied to the base of the switching transistor Q₁ vary in accordance with the variations in the voltage from the differential amplifier A₁ and the frequency of the triangular wave from the oscillator OSC . The duty factor and the switching frequency of the transistor Q₁ are controlled to keep the DC voltage V₁ and the AC voltage V₂ constant. In the above embodiment, the inverter at the primary winding comprises a forward type inverter. However, the present invention is not limited to this arrangement. A half bridge type inverter or a full bridge type inverter can be used in place of the forward type inverter. The pulse width and frequency control circuit is exemplified by a PUM consisting of a variable frequency triangular wave oscillator and a comparator in the above description. Alternatively, the output signals from the two amplifiers can be supplied to an astable multivibrator to control the ON time intervals of transistors constituting the astable multivibrator. Therefore, the switching frequency and the ON time intervals can be simultaneously controlled. According to the present invention, the stabilizing power source apparatus has a single switching circuit, so that the number of components is decreased and the manufacturing cost is decreased. In addition, the apparatus is made small as a whole, and its reliability is improved.
