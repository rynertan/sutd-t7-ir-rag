# Molding composition.

## Abstract
Interpolymers resulting from the polymerisation of a vinyl aromatic monomer such as styrene, an olefinic nitrile such as acrylonitrile and a maleimide in the presence of both an ethylene propylene diene terpolymer EPDM and an ethylene acrylate copolymer and molded products produced therefrom.
