# Electrostatic deflection type cathode ray tubes.

## Abstract
A vertical and horizontal deflection electrode system for an electrostatic deflection type cathode ray tube comprises vertical V , V and horizontal H H deflection elec trodes formed in patterns on the inner surface of a glass envelope of the tube. The ratio of the area of the vertical deflection electrodes V , V to the area of the horizontal deflection electrodes H , H is selected to be approximate ly equal to the deflection aspect ratio of an electron beam of the tube in the vertical and horizontal directions, which results in the voltage required for deflection being substan tially decreased.
