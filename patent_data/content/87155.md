## Description
This invention relates to a semiconductor device provided with a means for preventing the breakdown of an insulation layer. In an MOS Metal Oxide Semiconductor device, for example, in which a gate electrode is provided, through an insulation layer, onto a silicon substrate portion between a source region and drain region and in which the potential of a silicon substrate portion beneath the insulation layer is controlled through said gate electrode, the input impedance is extremely high and the thickness of the insulation layer for example, oxide layer is very thin such as 40 to 100nm and the insulation withstand voltage thereof is as very low as 20 to 100V. For this reason, when static electricity of a relatively high potential produced, for example, due to friction or the like, is applied to an input terminal of the gate electrode of the MOS device, the oxide layer gate oxide layer is easily brokendown. Accordingly, a protective circuit, including a semiconductor element for clamping a high voltage from the input terminal to a specified value by the forward characteristic of the pn junction or the breakdown characteristic of the pn junction, so as to prevent the breakdown of the gate oxide layer of the MOS device to be protected is necessarily connected to the input terminal of the gate electrode of the MOS device. An example of this protective circuit is explained below with reference to Fig. 1. In Fig. 1, numeral 1 denotes an MOS transistor which is to be protected and numeral 2 denotes a signal input terminal to a gate electrode of that MOS transistor 1. Between the gate electrode of the MOS transistor 1 and the signal input terminal 2, there is connected a protective circuit 3. The protective circuit 3 includes a resistor R connected between the signal input terminal 2 and the gate electrode of the MOS transistor to be protected, and an MOS transistor 4 whose source drain path is connected between the output end of this resistor R and a voltage source Vss which is usually set at a level of OV and in which the gate electrode and source are connected. Since the gate electrode of the MOS transistor 4 is connected to the voltage source Vss, it is possible to increase the protection of the gate oxide layer of the MOS transistor 1 for example, an input MOS transistor of the MOS integrated circuit by utilizing the fact that the breakdown voltage of the pn junction of the MOS transistor 4 on the drain side decreases in level. In the above mentioned protective circuit 3, the high voltage applied to the signal input terminal 2, at the time of passing through the resistor R, varies from its sharp waveform to a relatively gentle waveform, and this voltage of gentle waveform is inputted to the pn junction of the MOS transistor 4 and is thus clamped to a specified voltage. Accordingly, the MOS transistor 1 is protected from being brokendown. Fig. 2 shows a plan pattern of the protective circuit 3 shown in Fig. 1. In Fig. 2, an aluminium wire 6 is led out from a bonding pad 5, and is connected at one end to a first end 8 of the resistor R through a contact hole 7. This resistor R is formed of a diffusion layer or polycrystalline silicon layer and, after it is wired over a relatively large length, is connected to a drain diffusion layer 4a of the MOS transistor 4, and is also connected to a gate electrode 11 of the MOS transistor 1 through contact holes 9 and 10. Note here that a drain diffusion layer of the MOS transistor 1 is designated by the reference numeral 1a, while a source diffusion layer thereof is designated by the reference numeral 1b. In addition, a drain diffusion layer of the MOS transistor 4 is designated by the reference numeral 4a, a source diffusion layer thereof by the reference numeral 4b and a gate electrode thereof by the reference numeral 12. The power source Vss has its line 13 connected to the source diffusion layer 4b through a contact hole 14 and connected to the gate electrode 12 through a contact hole 15. The resistor R usually has a resistance value of 500 to several kilo ohms and a time constant of 1 to 5nS. That is, this time constant causes a decrease in level of the peak voltage of a pulse having a sharp rise applied to the first end 8 of the resistor R and is so adjusted as to permit a forward or backward response at the diffusion layer of the MOS transistor 4. Conventionally, the protection of the gate oxide layer of the MOS transistor 1 was effected solely by the use of the above mentioned protective circuit 3. With the progress of the techniques concerned, however, the gate oxide layer of the MOS transistor 1 has become thinner than in the prior art. This makes it very difficult to design the protective circuit 3 accordingly. Because the use of the protective circuit 3 alone is insufficient to protect the thin gate oxide layer of the MOS transistor 1, the breakdown of the MOS transistor 1 occurs very often. In an effort to prevent the breakdown of the MOS transistor 1 to sufficient degree, the inventor of the present application has made various investigations into the causes of this type of breakdown and, as a result, has found that the breakdown of the insulation layer occurs at specified portions. Reference will now be made to the said result of investigations by the use of Figs. 3 and 4. As shown in Fig. 3, the regions where the breakdown of the gate insulation layer occurs are the side edge portions 11a and 11b the portions having small radii of curvature and being represented by dotted lines a and b of the gate electrode polycrystalline silicon 11. The side edge portions are located in the directions of the source and drain regions. And it has been confirmed that breakdown does not occur at a central portion 11c of the gate electrode 11. To explain more in detail by the use of a sectional view shown in Fig. 4, the portion of the insulation layer 16 which is located beneath the central portion 11c has a uniform distribution of electric lines of force 17 and is therefore kept from breaking down. However, the electric lines of force from the side edge portion 11a are concentrated, as shown in Fig. 4, since the radius of curvature thereof is small. Accordingly, the portion of the insulation layer beneath this side edge portion 11a receives an extremely high electric field and it has thus been proved that this insulation layer portion is brokendown owing to discharge attributable to the application of this electric field. For the purpose of decreasing the degree of concentration of the electric lines of force at the side edge portion 11a, it is contemplated to form the polycrystalline silicon gate electrode 11 by patterning based on the use of etching techniques, and thereafter to perform what is called after oxidation directed to oxidizing the surface of the electrode 11, thereby enlarging both the radius of curvature of the side edge portion 11a and the thickness of the gate oxide layer including this side edge portion. However, it is not possible to make the radius of curvature of the side edge portion 11a larger than the thickness of the gate electrode. When the said after oxidation is excessively performed, the thickness of the gate electrode 11 is decreased and this will decrease the radius of curvature of the side edge portion 11a. This undesirably affects the width of the gate electrode and the depth of the diffusion layer. This means that a limitation is imposed upon the degree of the after oxidation . It is therefore impossible to greatly increase the insulation withstand voltage of the MOS transistor 1. On the other hand, the protective circuit shown in Fig. 2 is in some cases so constructed as to have a plan pattern as shown in Fig. 9. The protective circuit shown in Fig. 9 is different from that shown in Fig. 2 in that a second terminal of the resistor R and diffusion layer 4a of the MOS transistor 4 are connected by means of an aluminium lead 19 through contact holes 9 and 18. In Fig. 9, the same parts are denoted by the same reference notations as in Fig. 2. Referring to Fig. 9, as previously mentioned in connection with Fig. 2, the resistor R has a resistance value of, for example, 500 to several kilo ohms and a time constant of, for example, 1 to 5ns. Note here that an insulation layer is interposed, though not shown, between this resistor R and the semiconductor substrate. Consider a case where this resistor R is formed of a diffusion layer. In this case, upon application of a high voltage to the bonding pad 5, this high voltage is applied to the first end 8 of the resistor R through the aluminium lead 6 and contact hole 7. This gives rise to a breakdown at the first end 8 to cause a local current to pass through the same. In a CMOS Complementary MOS transistor, not shown a latch up phenomenon this indicates the phenomenon wherein a large current flows due to input noises and the like is liable to occur. Therefore, it is preferable to use the polycrystalline silicon as the material of the resistor R. Even in this case, however, the protective circuit for the transistor to be protected is brokendown according to a circuit condition. Preventing the dielectric breakdown of the protective circuit of the transistor to be protected for example, the transistor 1 of Fig. 1 has the same significance as directly preventing the dielectric breakdown of the transistor to be protected. With this in mind, the inventor of this application has made investigations of the dielectric breakdown of the resistor R, the results being explained with reference to Figs. 9 to 11. That is, the electric lines of force are concentrated to a remarkable extent in the regions beneath the side edge portions 20a and 20b of the resistor R of Fig. 10, with the result that the insulation layer falling under these regions is broken down. On the other hand, the region located beneath the central portion 20c of the resistor R has a uniform electric line of force distribution, with the result that the insulation layer falling under this region is freed from breakdown. Fig. 11 shows a distribution of electric lines of force in a sectional area taken along the line XI XI of Fig. 10. It is seen from Fig. 11 that the electric lines of force are remarkably concentrated particularly in the side edge portion 20a. It has thus been proved from the said results of investigation that it will be possible to prevent the breakdown of the gate insulation layer of the MOS transistor 1 to be protected by decreasing the degree of concentration of electric lines of force at the side edge portions of the gate electrode 11. It has also been proved that the breakdown of the insulation layer portion beneath the resistor R of the protective circuit can be prevented by decreasing the degree of concentration of electric lines of force at the side edge portions of the resistor R. Prior art document GB A 2 045 525 describes a field effect transistor construction in which a breakdown voltage is increased by providing shield electrodes which surround conductive connections to source and drain regions. These shield electrodes lie in an insulating layer over a semiconductor body, closer to the conductive connections and further from the surface of the semiconductor body than a gate electrode. In this way, electric fields produced in a silicon region are mitigated. In this field effect transistor construction a conductor insulatively disposed over a gate electrode is applied with a potential different from that applied to the gate electrode. Further, prior art document US A 4 288 829 describes a protective circuit on an insulating substrate for protecting MOS integrated circuits. A bonding pad overlies an end portion of a resistor which is arranged on an oxide layer and covered by an oxide layer. The resistor is connected at its first end to the bonding pad and at its other end to a junction of a drain region. However, the bonding pad covers only the end portion of the resistor. The object of the invention is to provide a semiconductor device which is provided with a means for preventing the concentration of electric lines of force at the side edge portions of a conductive layer provided within a semiconductor substrate. The present invention provides a semiconductor device having features as stated in claim 1. Further, claims 2 to 6 describe preferred embodiments of the present invention. This invention can be more fully understood from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Description will now be given of a semiconductor device with reference to Figs. 5 and 6. In Figs. 2 and 3, a diffusion region 4c constituting an extended portion of the drain diffusion region 4a of the MOS transistor 4 is connected, by means of the aluminium lead 21, to the gate electrode 11 of the MOS transistor 1 to be protected through the contact holes 9 and 10. In the semiconductor device shown in Fig. 5, an aluminum conductive layer 25 is provided so as to cover the upper surface of the gate electrode 11. As shown in Fig. 6, this aluminium conductive layer 25 is held at the same potential as the gate electrode 11 by having part of it contact the gate electrode 11, and its side edge portion 25a is extended beyond a side edge portion 11a of the gate electrode 11. For this reason, the concentration of electric lines of force at the side edge portion 11a of the gate electrode 11 is mitigated. Accordingly, the gate insulation layer is not brokendown at the area falling beneath this side edge portion 11a. Although there is a likelihood that a concentrated electric field is produced at the side portion 25a of the aluminum conductive layer 25, still, the portion of the insulation layer beneath the side edge portion 25a is not brokendown because the thickness of the insulation layer between the side edge portion 25a and the substrate is greater than the thickness of the gate oxide layer. In a semiconductor device shown in Fig. 7, a polycrystalline silicon layer 26 allowed to contact the gate electrode 11 is used as the conductive layer for covering the gate electrode 11. Also in this case, it is possible to mitigate the concentration of electric lines of force 17 at the side edge portion 11a of the gate electrode since the insulation layer beneath the silicon layer 26 is made thinner than that beneath the aluminium conductive layer shown in Fig. 6. However, it is possible that the electric lines of force are concentrated at the side edge portion 26a of the conductive layer 26 to cause the breakdown of the insulation layer portion falling below the side edge portion 26a. In a semiconductor device shown in Fig. 8, the region above the gate electrode 11 is covered by the polycrystalline silicon layer 26 having the same potential as the gate electrode 11, said layer 26 being further covered by an aluminium conductive layer 27 having the same potential as the layer 26. A side edge portion 27a of this aluminium conductive layer 27 is extended beyond the side edge portion 26a of the layer 26. According to this semiconductor device, it is possible to largely mitigate the concentration of electric lines of force at the side edge portion 11a of the gate electrode 11 and at the side edge portion 26a of the conductive layer 26. It is to be noted here that in the sectional views of Figs. 4, 6, 7 and 8 the insulation layer exists in the interspace between the line 28 and the substrate, but an illustration thereof is omitted for the sake of simplicity. The gate electrode 11 is not limited to a one formed of polycrystalline silicon alone but may be formed of Mo, Mo silicon or W. In addition, the provision of the conductive layers 25, 26 and 27 does not necessitate the modification of steps for the process of manufacturing the semiconductor device, nor the addition of steps for this process, nor the enlargement of chip size. Reference will now be made to an embodiment of the invention with the use of Figs. 12 and 13. In Fig. 12, the resistor R formed of polycrystalline silicon is provided within the insulation layer on the substrate and has its one end 8 connected to the aluminium lead wire 6 extended from the bonding pad 5 through the contact hole 7. The second end of this resistor R is connected to the drain diffusion layer 4a of the MOS transistor 4 through contact holes 9, 18 and the aluminum wire 19. The relationship between each of the portions of the MOS transistor 4 will not be described here in detail since it was explained above in connection with Fig. 9. Substantially all of the upper surface of the resistor R, including its first end 8, is covered by the aluminium conductive layer 29. As shown in Fig. 13 a sectional view taken along the line XIII XIII of Fig. 12 , the aluminium conductive layer 29 is held at the same potential as the resistor R by being brought into electric contact with the resistor R through a contact hole 30, and is connected to the aluminium wire 6. A side edge portion 29a of the aluminium conductive layer 29 is extended beyond the side edge portion 20a of the resistor R. Fig. 13 indicates that the concentration of electric lines of force at the side edge portion 20a of the resistor R is largely mitigated See Fig. 11 . Fig. 13 also indicates that the electric lines of force 17 are concentrated, to some extent, at the side edge portion 29a of the conductive layer 29. Since, however, the thickness of the insulation layer between this side edge portion 29a and the substrate SUB is, for example, twice or three times as large as the thickness of the insulation layer between the side edge portion 20a of the resistor R and the substrate SUB, the insulation layer located beneath the side edge portion 29a is not brokendown. The inventor of the present invention performed breakdown tests with respect to the protective circuits shown in Fig. 9 and Fig. 12. As a result, the protective circuit shown in Fig. 9 was broken down by the application of a voltage of 200V while the protective circuit shown in Fig. 12 withstood an applied potential of more than 350V. As shown in Fig. 14 directed to a second embodiment of the invention, this invention can be reduced so that the aluminum conductive layer 29 may cover the upper surface of the first end 8 of the resistor R and a part of the resistor R directly behind this first end. In a third embodiment shown in Fig. 15, only a small portion extending from the first end 8 of the resistor R is covered by the aluminium conductive layer 29. The protective circuits according to the embodiments shown in Figs. 14 and 15 have a slightly smaller protecting ability than the protective circuit according to the first embodiment shown in Fig. 12. However, they still produce the effect of the present invention. This is because it is the first end 8 of the resistor R near the contact hole 7 closest to the bonding pad 5 that receives a high voltage having a sharp peak value. In more detail, in the portion of the resistor R extending from this first end 8 to the contact hole 9, an excessive voltage waveform is allowed to decrease by degrees by the function of the resistor R. And when the pn junction of the MOS transistor 4 is forwardly rendered conductive, or when this pn junction is rendered conductive due to breakdown, the excessive voltage value is allowed to decrease by degrees, from the first terminal 8, due to the voltage drop in the resistor R. Thus, the structures shown in Figs. 14 and 15 also produce the effect of the present invention. In a fourth embodiment, shown in Fig. 16, a polycrystalline silicon resistor R₁ having a relatively low resistance is connected between the contact holes 7 and 31, contact holes 31 and 32 are connected by means of the aluminium wire 19, and the contact hole 32 and the drain diffusion layer 4a of the MOS transistor 4 are connected by a resistor R₂ constituted by a diffusion layer. In this embodiment, the whole upper surface of the polycrystalline silicon resistor R₁ is covered by the aluminium conductive layer 29. Also in the structure of Fig. 16, however, the resistor R₁ may be covered by the aluminium conductive layer 29, the first end 8 and the part of the resistor R₁ directly behind the first end 8 may be covered by the aluminium conductive layer 29, as shown in Fig. 14, or only the small portion extending from the first end of the resistor R₁ may be covered by the aluminium conductive layer 29, as shown in Fig. 15. The resistors R of Figs. 12, 14 and 15 and the resistor R₁ of Fig. 16 have been described as being formed of polycrystalline silicon. Instead of these resistors, however, a resistor formed of MoSi₂, Mo, or W may be provided within the insulation layer. Further, the kind of semiconductor device which can be protected in the above mentioned way is not limited to MOS integrated circuits, but may be bipolar integrated circuits, or an MOS transistor as a single unit. The above mentioned embodiments of Figs. 12 to 16 can be reduced without modifying the process steps for manufacturing the body of a semiconductor device, adding a process step or steps to such process steps, or enlarging the chip size.
