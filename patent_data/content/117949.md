# Packing for packed towers inter fluid contact.

## Abstract
A packing material for a packed tower through which fluids to be processed are adapted to flow in contact with each other. The packaging material comprises a packing block of honeycomb structure comprising partition walls defining a multiplicity of channels which are formed in parallel to each other as fluid passages through the packing block. The packing block includes plural plane sides in which said channels are open at opposite ends thereof. At least one of these plane sides is non orthogonal or inclined to a line of extension of the channels. This at least one non orthogonal plane side may have a larger surface area than the rest of the plane, sides of the packing block. The packing block is preferably a polyhedron having not less than eight planes sides each as viewed in elevation, so that said channels are open in non orthogonal relation with at least two of the plane sides of the polyhedron.
