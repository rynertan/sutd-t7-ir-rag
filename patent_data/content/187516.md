## Description
The present invention relates to a prosthetic alignment device comprising at least two co operating members having opposing curved surfaces. Alignment devices are known which comprise a number of co operating members having curved spherical surfaces which are movable relative to one another to adjust the alignment of a prosthesis. The co operating members may have slots within which the central bolt of the device can travel and other may have abrasive surfaces to aid locking of the members together. The known devices are complicated to adjust and the set alignment is difficult to determine. According to the present invention there is provided a prosthetic alignment device comprising at least two co operating members having opposing curved faces, characterized in that the faces include means for defining a direction of relative movement of the co operating members and for calibrating that movement, the said means for defining and calibrating comprising a row of teeth on the said face a of one member and a corresponding row of indentation s on the said face b of the opposing member, the said faces being curved in the said direction of movement. The rows of engaging teeth and indentations define the direction one member is to move relative to the other. The pitch of the teeth gives a pre determined angle of adjustment of the two co operating members, and by counting the number of teeth or indentations visible the adjustment of the two members and consequently the alignment of the prosthesis can be immediately calculated. The device preferably comprises three cooperating members having opposing spherically curved surfaces. The opposing faces of the first and second members have a row of teeth and a row of indentations and the opposing faces of the second and third members have a row of teeth and a row of indentations, these latter rows being perpendicular to the former rows. Thus, Posterior Anterior Lateral Medial P.A.L.M. adjustment is provided for. Preferably, the indentations are formed as a row of grooves extending perpendicular to the direction of relative movement and the teeth are in the form of a row of ribs again extending perpendicular to that direction. The rows of ribs and grooves form parallel sided tracks which together define the direction of movement. An embodiment of the present invention is described in detail below, by example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein Fig. 1 is partly sectional and partly elevational view of a device according to the invention fixed in a prosthesis and Fig. 2 is a view from below of one of the cooperating members of the device of Fig. 1. The alignment device illustrated comprises three cooperating members 1,2 and 3 having opposing spherical faces a, b, c and d. A row of teeth, e.g. 4 on one member is engageable with a row of indentations 15, seen best at 5 on another member. The individual parts of the device and the other prosthetic elements shown in Fig. 1 are discussed below. Locking Unit 1 first cooperating member The spherical alignment mounting of the invention may consist of a number of injection moulded components and stainless steel tensioning units that give all the requirements of alignment and this, together with the low cost of production and corrosion resistance, provides a considerable improvement of any previously designed alignment device and overcomes the following disadvantages of known devices
