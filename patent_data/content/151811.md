# Method for maskless ion implantation.

## Abstract
This invention relates to an ion implantation apparatus and method for maskless processing of substrate 12 , and more particularly, to form ion implanted pattern by selective ly scanning a focused ion beam on the surface of a processing substrate 12 . The timing of the apparatus is controlled by a variable frequency clock pulse. By using the variable frequency oscillator 25 , a clock frequency can be controlled continuously. So, the ion implantation pattern is easily controlled by the clock frequency and scanning number with high accuracy compared to prior art.
