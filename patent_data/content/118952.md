# Mowing device having improved drive and or a crop separating drum.

## Abstract
A mowing device comprises a frame 1 movable across a field and a cutter bar 2 carried by said frame and having a plurality of cutting members 6 rotatably driven about standing shafts 5 through a transmission 15 housed in said bar, said frame being adapted to accomodate crop crushing means 3 at a higher level than the cutter bar, wherein a common main drive 7 rotates one of the outermost cutting members and, if necessary, the crushing means through an intermediate drive arranged in a rotating drum on top of said outermost cutting member. In order to limit the disadvantage of crop winding around the drum at low numbers of revolution and to minimize the imbalance of fast rotating cutting members the drum of the mowing device is constructed in the form of two coaxial, aligned drum parts 18, 18 , between which a gap shaped space 5 is left free.
