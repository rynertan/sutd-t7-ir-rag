# Dental jacket crown, coping and method of construction.

## Abstract
The dental jacket crown of the present invention is prepared from a thin metal foil substrate which is coated with a noble based metal composition having a low fusing temperature and folded in a predetermined manner to form multiple folds in the form of triangular like flaps or pleats 22 . The folded foil represents the coping 16 of the present invention. The coping 16 is mounted over a die of the prepared tooth and the flaps 22 wrapped in overlapping formation and then adapted to the die. The die is removed and the structure heated preferably under a bunsen burner. A bonding material may be coated over the free standing structure if desired. A veneering material such as procelain is then coated over the structure to form the crown.
