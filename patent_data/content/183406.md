# Fail safe output switching circuit.

## Abstract
A dynamic output, of the type used in railway signalling and railway control, in which a vital state represented by an alternating signal is provided by an output transformer device 1 driven by two opposing anti phase current switch ing circuits 14,17 15,16 . The circuits 14,17 15,16 are designed to operate in a fail safe manner an original vital signal is employed to modulate a higher frequency which is rectified to provide a source of current 10, 11 resp. which is, in turn, connected to an output device 1 through self commutating switching means 14,17 15,16 to supply current in one direction and to provide a return path for current in an opposite direction. The two switching circuits 14,17 15,16 are operated by anti phase modulated signals so that both must function normally to achieve a full output.
