# Sheet material conveying device.

## Abstract
A sheet material conveying device 60 having a feed roller assembly 62 and a temporary hampering means 64 disposed downstream thereof. The sheet material conveying device includes a driven shaft 134 to be roitated by a driving source and a driven roller 70 mounted thereon. The driven roller has an inside diameter larger than the outside diameter of the driven shaft and is mounted rotatably on the driven shaft. When the forward movement of the sheet material fed by the feed roller assembly is hampered by the temporary hampering means, the rotation of the driven roller is stopped by the resistance of the sheet material exerted on the driven roller in spite of the rotation of the driven shaft.
