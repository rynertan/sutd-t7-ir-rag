# A method of rolling metal.

## Abstract
In a method of rolling metal 1 in a roll stand 21 24 for producing a metal date or a metal sheet having a desired range of thickness through a sequence of rolling passes, variations in the deformation resistance F n of the metal along the longitudinal direction of the metal are detected by a load cell 4 , variations in deformation resistance and the resulting variations in rolling force in the finishing pass are estimated by a computer 7 and the rolling for obtaining the necessary thickness of the metal at the entrance of the finishing pass is carried out under a combination of feedback automatic gauge control by a circuit 5 and a feed forward automatic gauge control process effected by a controller 6 , whereby variations in the rolling force are cancelled even if the metal which is to be rolled has skid marks thereon.
