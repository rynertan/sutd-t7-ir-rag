## Description
PROCESS FOR THE HYDRATION AND OLIGOMERISATION OF OLEFINS This invention relates to a process for the preparation of a composition suitable for addition to a motor gasoline which process comprises the hydration and oligomerisation of C3 to C6 alkenes. It has been previously proposed to incorporate oxygen containing compounds into motor gasoline for a variety of different purposes. For example, to increase the amount of useful fuel, methanol has been described. To improve octane number, methyl tertiary butyl ether has been proposed. Oxygen containing compounds have also been described for other.purposes, for example, FrenchPatent No 2149113 discloses the use of aliphatic ethers, optionally in combination with an alcohol, as a gasoline additive for reducing carbon monoxide emissions and isopropanol has been described as a carburettor deicing additive. French Patent 2 149 113 discloses the use of aliphatic ethers, including diisopropyl ether, optionally in combination with an alcohol, as a gasoline additive for reducing carbon monoxide emissions. British Patent No 950 147 discloses a fuel composition which comprises a a major proportion of a hydrocarbon base boiling in the gasoline range and having a Research Octane Number of at least 90, b an octane improving amount of an organic metal containing anti knock agent e.g. tetra alkyl lead, c a co anti knock agent which is a monoester and d a co anti knock extender which is an alcohol or an ether. A suitable co anti knock extender is diisopropyl ether containing a minor proportion of isopropanol. The organic metal containing anti knock agent is an essential component of the compositions since it is stated in the patent that in the absence of the organic metal containing anti knock agent substantially no octane number benefit is obtained by the addition of the co anti knock agents to the gasoline. It is important that oxygen containing compounds or mixtures added to gasoline should have high Blending Octane Numbers BRON when blended to typical gasoline basestocks. A process has now been invented to which alkenes are converted to a product mixture of oligomers and ethers which has high BRON when blended in typical gasoline basestocks. According to the present invention a process for the hydration and oligomerisation of one or more C3 to C6 olefins to produce a reaction product containing oligomers of the alkenes, ethers and optionally alcohols comprises passing a feed containing C3 to C6 alkenes and water in a amour ratio of water to alkene of fron 1 3 to 1 90 over an acid hydration catalyst under hydration conditions. The alkene for the feed can conveniently be provided by refinery process streams a substantial proportion of which compriseC3 to Cg, more preferably C3 and or C4, alkenes such as, for example, C3 C4 streams from catalytic cracking. Any conventional acid hydration catalyst may be used. Suitable catalysts include A cation exchangeable layered clay in which there is a metal cation, B hydrogen ion exchanged layered clays, C stabilised pillared interlayered clay and D cation exchanged organic resins. Catalysts of the type A , B and C are known and are described, for example, in published European PatentApplications 0031687, 0031252, 0083970 and 0116469. Catalysts of type D are also known and some are coinerciafly available. Preferably the acid hydration catalyst is a cation exchange organic resin. Preferably the molar ratio of water to alkene in the feed is from 1 4 to 1 50 and more preferably in the case of a butene from 1 20 to 1 50 and in the case of a propene 1 5 to 1 20. It has been found that the process has unexpected advantages in that it can be controlled so as i to produce a liquid reaction product which contains at least 40 by weight of oligomers but less than 5 by wt of products of carbon number 12 and higher and also ii to produce a liquid reaction product containing less than 0.5Z by weight of water, preferably less than 0.2Z. This latter advantage is particularly significant in that the product can be added direct to a gasoline basestock without any intermediate drying step. The molar proportions of reactants and reaction conditions can be selected so as i to produce a liquid reaction product containing from 70 to 99X by weight of oligomers, from 1 to 30 by weight of ethers and up to 10 by weight of alcohols or ii to produce a liquid reaction product containing from 40 to 70t by weight of oligomers, from 20 to 50 by weight of ethers and from 10 to 40 by weight of alcohols. The ethers are typical dialkyl ethers and at least one of the alkyl group is usually branched. The liquid product can be added to any gasoline for example a straight run gasoline, a cat cracked spirit or mixtures thereof.Preferably the gasoline has, before the addition of the additive composition a Research Octane Number RON of from 80 to 105, more preferably 90 to 98, and a Motor Octane Number MON of from 75 to 95, more preferably from 80 to 88. The gasoline may contain the following proportions of olefins, aromatics and saturates Aromatics 20 to 60 volume Saturates 20 to 70 volume Olefins 0 to 30X volume The octane improving additive possesses high Blending ResearchOctane Number and Blending Motor Octane Number which generally increase with increasing amounts of oxygenated components. Typical values are in the range 100 to 116 for Research Octane Number and 95 to 106 for Motor Octane Number in one gasoline basestock. TheBlending Octane Numbers obtained will vary with the composition of the gasoline used as basestock. Conventional organic metal containing anti knock agents such as tetra ethyl lead are not required in gasoline incorporating products according to the present invention. However, other conventional gasoline additives such as, for example, scavengers and anti oxidants may be included in the fuel compositions. Other oxygenated compounds may also be included in the fuel compositions according to the present invention. The present invention is illustrated by the following examples.Example 1 not according to the invention. A mixture of propene and n heptane was hydrated. The amount of propene in the mixture was 46Z by weight and the molar ratio of propene to water was 1.5 1. The feedstock was passed in a continuous upward flow through a hydrogen exchanged WyomingBentonite catalyst. The process was carried out at a temperature of 158 C, and a liquid hourly space velocity EHSV of 2. The catalyst was prepared by adding sodium bentonite a WyomingBentonite supplied as a fine powder for use in drilling muds to a solution of concentrated sulphuric acid 40owl in water 1100my and allowing the mixture to stand at room temperature approximately 20 C for 48 hours with occasional stirring. The clay was separated from the solution and washed with water by repeated centrifuging and re suspending in water until the pE of the supernatant solution was the same as the distilled water used in the washing. The clay was dried at 800C in air and ground into granules. A liquid sample produced by the process over a 16 hour period comprised 97Z by weight of an organic phase and 3 by weight of an aqueous phase. The organic phase comprised 66.3X by weight heptane, 2.4 by weight isopropanol, 9.0X by weight diisopropyl ether and 22.3 by weight propene oligomers. The aqueous phase comprised approximately 18.4 by weight isopropanol. The conversion of propene was calculated to be 56 and the conversion of water was calculated to be 72 .Example 2 An octane improving additive composition was prepared by hydrating a mixture of propene and propane. The molar ratio of propene to propane in the feedstock was 1 1 and the molar ratio of propene to water was 8 1. The feedstock was passed in a continuous downward flow over a catalyst bed of a commercially available catalyst sold by Dow under the trade name DOWEX 50 W X8 H which is a hydrogen ion exchanged cation exchanged organic resin catalyst in which the active group is a sulphonic acid group. The hydration was carried out at a temperature of 147 C and a pressure of 60 bar. The liquid hourly space velocity LHSV was 1.5. Propene conversion was approximately 5 . The single phase liquid product obtained comprised 76 by weight ispropanol and 17 by weight diisopropyl ether.The product was combined with the product of other runs carried out under similar reaction conditions. This bulk mixture was partially dried using anhydrous magnesium sulphate. The octane improving additive composition produced comprised 70 by weight isopropanol, 22X by weight diisopropyl ether, 3 by weight propene oligomers and 5X water. The octane improving additive was blended with an unleaded gasoline having a Research Octane Number of 90 and a Motor Octane Number of 82. The concentration of the additive in the gasoline was 10 by volume.Using this pure composition, theBlending Research Octane Number of the octane improving additive composition was determined to be 110 and the Blending Motor OctaneNumber was 97. Example 3 An octane improving additive composition suitable for use in fuel compositions was prepared by reacting water and a mixture comprising 43.8 by weight butene, 20.9 by weight n butene, 8.2Z by weight isobutene and 26.92 by weight propene over the same ion exchanged resin catalyst as used in Example 2. The molar ratio of alkene to water was 4.5 1. The hydration reaction was carried out at a temperature of 1500C and a pressure of 80 bar. The liquid hourly space velocity was 2. The conversion of alkenes was 15 and the conversion of water was 36 .The liquid product comprised 51 by weight of alcohols, 8.4 ethers, 13 by weight oligomers, 5 dissolved gases and 22X water. This product was combined with the product obtained in other runs under similar conditions. After partial drying over anhydrous magnesium sulphate, the product comprised 58.5 by weight alcohols, 18 by weight ethers, 18.2Z by weight oligomers and 4X by weight water. The octane improving additive composition was blended with an unleaded gasoline having aResearch Octane Number of 90 and a Motor Octane Number of 82. The concentration of the additive in gasolinewas 10X by volume.Using this fuel composition, the Blending Research Octane Number and theBlending Motor Octane Number of the octane improving additive composition were found to be 112 and 100 respectively.Example 4 Example 3 was repeated except that the molar ratio of alkene to water was 4 1 and the catalyst used was a commercially available hydrogen ion exchanged catalyst sold under the trade nameNAFION 811. The conversion of alkene was 18 and the conversion of water was 92 . The liquid product comprised 27.3Z by weight alcohols, 26.1 by weight ethers, 35.3 by weight oligomers, 8.9Z dissolved gases and 2.3Z by weight water. Using a 10 by volume blend of the composition in an unleaded gasoline having a ResearchOctane Number of 90 and a Motor Octane Number of 82, the BlendingResearch Octane Number and Blending Motor Octane Number of the octane improving additive composition were found to be 110 and 102 respectively.Example 5 not according to the invention Propene 40g was charged into a stainless steel autoclave volume 200ml containing 10 grams of the same commercial ion exchanged organic resin catalyst as used in Example 2. The catalyst contained 50Z by weight of water to give a molar ratio of alkene to water of about 1 1. A further 10 grams of water were charged into the autoclave. The autoclave was sealed and stirred, by means of a sealed magnetic stirrer, at a reaction temperature of 1600C for a reaction period of 2.5 hours. After cooling, the gaseous products were vented off, and the liquid products removed.The yield and composition of the product are given in Table 5.Example 6 not according to the invention Example 5 was repeated except that only 2.5 grams of additional water were added to the autoclave instead of 10 grams to give a molar ratio of alkene to water of 2 1. The yield and composition of the liquid product are given in Table 5.Example 7 Example 5 was repeated except that no additional water was added to the autoclave the molar ratio of alkene to water being 3.6 1.

Under these conditions, 34X of the propene was converted to liquid products containing 2 w w dissolved unchanged feedstock, 44 low molecular weight oligomers of propene 40.3 Cs to Cg alkenes and 3.7 C10 to C12 alkenes and no hydrocarbons with a carbon number higher than 12 were detected , 54 oxygenates 5.6 isopropanol, 48.2X diisopropyl ether and 0.2 isopropyl propyl ether and 0.5X water. The octane improving liquid was blended as a 10 volume additive in an unleaded gasoline having a Research Octane Number of 90 and a Motor Octane Number of 82. Using this fuel composition, the Blending Research Octane Number and the Blending Motor OctaneNumber was determined as 106.4 and 99.2 respectively. Example 21 The alkene containing feedstock for this example was a C4 hydrocarbon stream produced by a steam cracker after butadiene and the bulk of the isobutene has been consumed by other processes. It has been analysed by gas chromatography as having the composition shown in Table 8. A feedstock comprising the composition shown in Table 8 and water in an alkene to water mole ratio of 42 1 was passed in a downward flow over a catayst bed consisting of XE 386 ion exchange resin. The reaction temperature was 1260C rising to 1460C at the end of the catalyst bed. The reaction pressure was 80 bar and theLHSV was 2. Under these conditions, 54X of the alkenes were converted to liquid products containing 33X w w dissolved unchangedC4 feedstock, 63 low molecular weight oligomers of butenes with a Cg C12 alkene weight ratio of 20 1 and no higher oligomers than C12 were detected , and 2.1X oxygenates 0.6Z secondary butanol and 1.5 di secondary butyl ether and no water was detected.
