# The preparation of certain diphenyl ethers especially 5 4 trifluoromethylphenoxy and 5 2 halo 4 trifluoromethylphenoxy 2 nitrobenzoic acid and salts and esters and amides.

## Abstract
Certain trifluoromethyl substituted diphenyl ethers can be prepared three of herbicidally inactive impurities by a process which comprises A reacting Compounds III , which are herbicidally active may be converted to other herbicidally active compounds by hydrolysis whereby R becomes alkali metal cation and, further reaction to form the free acid.
