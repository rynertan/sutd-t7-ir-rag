## Description
DATA INPUT APPARATUS The present invention is directed to apparatus for providing data input to an electrical device such as a data processing device. The present invention is designed to facilitate and render more transparent the interface between the operator and the electrical device, and provides a novel alternative to such data input devices as are presently encountered in the marketplace, such as joystick devices, track ball devices, electronic mouse input devices and the like. Data input apparatus, in accordance with the present invention, comprises transducer means for converting a physical displacement applied to actuator means into an electrical parameter and transmission means for communicating the physical displacement from the actuator means to the transducer means, characterised in that the actuator means has a substantially part spherical surface. Preferably the substantially part spherical surface is accessible to an operator s finger the actuator means is a body shaped as a segment of a sphere and thus has a substantially planar surface as well as the substantially part spherical surface the substantially planar surface is affixed to the transmission means and the physical displacement is applied by an operator s finger to the substantially part spherical surface. In a preferred embodiment, the actuator means responds to the physical displacement in a tilting motion about a point and the transmission means communicates with the transducer means to indicate the physical displacement in two dimensions, the transducer means is substantially planar and the point about which the actuator means is tiltable is displaced from the transducer means. The actuator means, the transmission means and the transducer means may all be carried by a hand holdable housing with at least a portion of the substantially part spherical surface of the actuator means protruding through an opening in the hdusing. The substantially part sphericalsurface of the actuator means may be constructed of material having a coefficient of friction appropriate to limit slip between the actuator means and an operator s finger. In a preferred embodiment, the conversion of the physical displacement to the electrical parameter is achieved in the manner disclosed in our UK patent publication GB 2 124 777 A claiming priority from US patent application 404 266 of 2 August 1982 or ourEuropean patent publication EP 0 119 673 Al claiming priority from US patent application 455 443 of 3 January 1983 . The reader is instructed to refer to those publications for further information. Briefly, in the present invention, the transmission means is responsive to the physical displacement to move towards the transducer means and couple electrically with the transducer means, the electrically coupled electrical properties of the transmission means and the transducer means varying progressively and increasingly as the transmission means is moved progressively and increasingly towards the transducer means.The transducer means may be connected within an electrical circuit so that an electrical potential difference is connected across the transducer means regardless of whether or not the transducer means is electrically coupled with the transmission means. Data input apparatus in accordance with the present invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 shows the data input apparatus in top plan view Figure 2 shows a side view taken as indicated from 2 2 of Figure 1 and Figure 3 shows a front view, in partial section, taken as indicated from 3 3 of Figure 1. Data input apparatus 10 is shown in Figure 1 in top plan view. The apparatus 10 includes a housing 12.Extending from the housing 12 are control buttons 14, actuator means 16 and a connection cord not shown for connection of the apparatus 10 to an electrical device such as a data processing device. As is best seen inFigures 2 and 3, also extending from the housing 12 are a plurality of supporting structures 18 in order that the apparatus 10 may be alternatively hand held or placed in a stable position upon a planar surface during operation. Referring now to Figure 3, it may be seen that the actuator means 16 is secured to transmission means 20.The actuator means 16 is a body shaped as a segment of a sphere, quite possibly being hemispherical, and includes a substantially part spherical surfce 22 and a substantially planar surface 24. The actuator means 16 is affixed to the transmission means 20 by its planar surface 24. The transmission means 20 includes a substantially planar transmission plate 26 with a plurality of protuberances 28 attached to the transmission plate 26.The transmission plate 26 communicates through the protuberances 28 with transducer means 30 and the transducer means 30 is electrically attached not shown to an electrical device in order that the electrical signals produced by the transducer means 30 in response to physical displacement of the actuator means 16, and communication of that physical displacement via the transmission plate 26 and the protuberances 28 to the transducer means 30, may be provided as an input to the electrical device not shown . Of course, it will be immediately apparent to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be incorporated in environments other than the housing 12 as shown. For example, the present invention may be incorporated in a keyboard as a cursor control input apparatus for an electrical device such as a data processing device, or as an input device for an electronic game, or the like. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention it is contemplated that at least the surface 22 of the actuator means 16, and quite possibly the entire actuator means 16, will be constructed of material having a coefficient of friction appropriate to limit slip between the actuator means 16 and the means employed to impart physical displacement to the actuator 16, such as a human operator s finger or the like. The actuator means 16 may respond to the physical displacement in a tilting motion about a point and the transmission means 20 communicates with the transducer means 30 to indicate the physical displacement in two dimensions, such as the x and y axes of a cartesian coordinate system, and the transducer means 30 may be substantially planar, with the point about which the actuator means 16 is tiltable being displaced from the transducer means 30.
