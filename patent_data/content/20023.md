# Method and apparatus for the de aeration of pulp stock.

## Abstract
A deaerator for removing gases from complex liquids such as pulp slurries in accordance with one aspect of the invention includes an elongated tubular body 10 adapted to be disposed in a generally horizontal position and having an inlet end 12 and an exit end 14 for the flow of liquid therethrough. A chamber 20 adjacent the exit end is provided for accumulating gases therein and a gas removal vent 21 is associated with such chamber. A set of longitudinally extending vertical baffles 24 are disposed in a lower portion of the tubular body 10 , between which baffles a main portion of the liquid flows. A set of lateral baffles 30 extend across the interior of the tubular body 10 , such lateral baffles projecting above the longitudinal baffles 24 and being spaced apart along the tubular body. The lateral baffles are also spaced from the top wall 18 of the tubular body 10 to define therebetween a flow channel 32 along which bubble containing liquid is guided toward the chamber. The longitudinal baffles 24 serve to create low velocity regions in the liquid adjacent the upper portions of such baffles thus promoting the rise of gas bubbles upwardly. The lateral baffles 30 assist in catching or skimming off the rising bubbles and also direct same into the flow channel 32 .
