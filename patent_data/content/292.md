# Production of chloro s triazine triones and their use in cleansing or bleaching compositions.

## Abstract
Chloro s triazine triones are used as a source of chlorine in cleansing and bleaching compositions. The usual method for the production of chloro s triazine triones comprises reacting cyanuric acid, an alkali metal hydroxide and chlorine in an aqueous reaction mixture from which the chloro s triazine trione crystallizes forming a slurry which is then filtered. The filtration characteristics of the slurry and the storage stability of the product are both affected by the form in which the chloro s triazine trione crystallizes from the aqueous reaction mixture, and improvements on prior art procedures are desirable. According to the present invention the reaction is carried out in the presence of a crystal modifier which is a disulfonic acid of an alkylated diphenyloxide wherein the alkyl group contains from 8 to 14 carbon atoms or a corresponding alkali metal disulfonate. A product having enhanced crystal properties and improved storage stability is obtained.
