# Splicer device to disassemble and recompose yarn mechanically.

## Abstract
The invention consists of a splicer device to dis assemble and recompose yarn mechanically, whereby said splicer device comprises facing disk means 20 120 to untwist aid retwist mechanically two yarns 46 126 posi tioned between said disk means 20 120 and also com prises means 49 149 to eliminate excessive tail ends of yarn pretruding from said disk means 20 120 , where by there are envisaged means to set said dick means 20 120 in rotation and means to actuate said means 49 149 that eliminate the excessive tail ends, said splicer device coniprising in coordinated cooperation means 50 providing variable, elastic thrust which can be defined momentarily between said disk means 20 120 adjustable means 51 to set said disk means 20 120 in rotation, and actuation means 32 50 51 which cooperate at least partly with one single programmed actuation means, phereby means 45 145 to position the two yarns 46 146 are included advantageously.
