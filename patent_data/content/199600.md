# A PEDAL MECHANISM FOR A BICYCLE HAVING THE PEDAL CRANK RADIALLY MOVABLE THEREON

## Abstract
A pedal mechanism for a bicycle has a radially movable pedal crank 6 provided thereon. There are also provided guide pulleys 1 which are each fixedly mounted on the frame of the bicycle and constituted by two members 9, 10 relatively rotatable one with the other. The bicycle frame further supports an arrangement formed of a sprocket 4 , a plate 5 , pins 7 engageable in a slot 2 in sprocket 4 and the pedal cranks 6 so that the length of the crank varies between minimum and maximum values during rotation. The member 10 has a pin hole 13 for receiving the pin 7 which is itself retained in a threaded pin hole 14 in the pedal crank. The mechanism according to the invention preferably has a sprocket 4 with fifty two teeth, a free wheel sprocket with eighteen teeth, and a drive ratio of 2.88. Owing to the variation the length of the driving arm of a crank, the power consumption can be lowered or operational speed can be increased up to 20 compared with the conventional pedal mechanism for a given input power.
