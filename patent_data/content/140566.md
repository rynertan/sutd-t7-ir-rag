# Rotor apparatus.

## Abstract
A rotor apparatus for producing power from the rotation thereof comprising a support 31 and a central core 1 having a spherical triangular cross section mounted on the support for rotation about a central axis through the core. Support arms 11, 11 13, 13 15, 15 fixed to the central core and extending radially outward therefrom at the ver ticies of the spherical triangle have airfoils 5, 7, 9 fixed to radially extended portions such that a gap 23, 25, 27 is formed between the surface of the central core and the surface of each airfoil, with the airfoils aligned on an axis parallel to the axis of the central core. During rotation, fluid flow, such as air flow, having at least a component in the direction perpendicular to the axis of the central core, flows through the gaps producing a venturi effect which enhances the movement of the airfoils about the axis of the central core.
