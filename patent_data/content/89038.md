# Process for preparing high molecular weight compounds.

## Abstract
A process for preparing polyoxyalkylene high molecular weight compounds having an average molecular weight of more than 20,000 and being soluble in solvents and mold able by addition polymerizing ethylene oxide alone or a mixture of alkylene oxides containing ethylene oxide to an organic compound having at least 2 active hydrogen groups to produce a polyhydroxyl compound having an average molecular weight of not less than 1,000, and esterifying the polyhydroxyl compound with a polycarboxylic acid, its anhydride or its lower alkyl ester.
