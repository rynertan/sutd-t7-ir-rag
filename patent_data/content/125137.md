# Measurement of enzyme catalysed reactions.

## Abstract
This invention related to equipment and methods for detecting the presence of, measuring the amount of, and or monitoring the level of, one or more selected components in a liquid mixture, employing an electrode sensing system. We have discovered that a class of mediating compounds has extremely useful properties for mediating the transfer of charge between enzyme catalysed reactions and electrode surfaces 15 in electrode sensing systems. Specifically, the specification discloses as electrode sen sor mediators, organometallic compounds composed of at least two organic rings, each of which has at least two double bonds in a conjugated relationship a metal atom is in electron sharing contact with those rings. An enzyme capable of catalyzing a reaction at a rate representative of the selected compound concentration is in contact with an assay mixture, and the mediator compound transfers charge between the enzyme and the conductive surface of the electrode at a rate representative of the enzyme catalyzed reaction rate.
