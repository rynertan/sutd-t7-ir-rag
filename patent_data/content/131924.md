# Method for producing hydrocarbons.

## Abstract
Contacting a mixture of hydrogen, carbon monoxide and or carbon dioxide with an intimate mixture of a carbon monoxide and or carbon dioxide reducing catalyst such as a Fischer Tropsch catalyst, and a catalyst carrier comprising a metal oxide having a very narrow pore size distribution in the micropores within the range of between 10 and 100 Angstr oms, to produce hydrocarbon mixtures useful in the manufac ture of gasoline, kerosene and light oil.
