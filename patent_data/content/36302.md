# Electromagnetic stirring apparatus.

## Abstract
Windings 14 of electromagnetic stirring apparatus sur round a longitudinal chamber 10 and are so connected and energised in use as to create a magnetic field rotating about the axis of the chamber. The windings 14 may be mounted on a non magnetic sleeve 12. Magnetically permeable material 22 is only located outside the windings, rather than between or inside the windings. The chamber 10 may be a mould for continuous casting of steel, the steel being stirred in the mol ten state as it passes longitudinally along the mould, at least the exterior skin cooling to the solid phase as it leaves the mould. Cooling may be assisted by a water jacket between the mould and the sleeve.
