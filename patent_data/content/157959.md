# Deceleration warning device for a vehicle.

## Abstract
A conductor wheel 21 is moved, upon release of the accelerator pedal, into contact with a conductor wheel 41 to close a motor circuit 52 and energise a motor 31 . The motor drives the conductor wheel 42 and operates a dis continuous switch 44 which thus discontinuously energises an indicator circuit 50 causing a lamp 51 to flash for a limited period.

## Description
DECELERATION WARNING DEVICE FOR A VEHICLE The invention relates to a device for giving a visible warning, particularly to the driver of a following vehicle, when a vehicle to which the device is fitted is about to decelerate. Traditionally such devices consist of brake warning lights which are energised when the brake pedal is depressed. What happens in practice is that, after the driver of the vehicle has made a conscious decision to brake his vehicle, he removes his foot from the accelerator pedal, transfers it to the brake pedal, and depresses the brake pedal. Our analysis has shown that this takes between one and one and a half seconds. This delays by a corresponding time the warning which a following driver will receive that the vehicle ahead is about to decelerate. If the delay could be reduced, there would be a reduced risk of accident, particularly when vehicles are driving fast on a motorway or when following closely behind one another at Ã  slower speed in city traffic. In accordance with one aspect of the invention, a vehicle deceleration warning device comprising a lamp which is energised to give a warning when a control pedal of a vehicle to which the device is fitted, is operated to cause potential deceleration of the vehicle is characterised by means which is arranged to respond to release of an accelerator pedal and thereupon and for a limited time periodically causes energisation of a warning lamp so that the lamp flashes for the limited period. Such a device responds immediately after the vehicle driver lifts his foot from the accelerator pedal and thus gives a following driver an earlier warning than in the case of conventional brake lights. The flashing of the warning lamp only occurs for a limited period, at the initiation of the deceleration thus saving energy and avoiding the unnecessary continuing flashing of the lamp when the accelerator pedal is not depressed, for example when the vehicle is coasting, or even stationary. The periodic operation may be provided electrically. For example, there may be a microswitch which is operated by the accelerator pedal and which switches a solid state pulsing circuit that energises the lamp with pulsed energy. Alternatively, the periodic operation may be provided mechanically, and, in accordance with a second aspect of the invention, a vehicle deceleration warning device of the kind comprising a lamp which is energised to give a warning when a control pedal of a vehicle, to which the device is fitted, in operated to cause potential deceleration of the vehicle, is characterised by means which is arranged to respond to release of an accelerator pedal and thereupon enables closure of an electrical motor circuit containing a motor so that the motor is energised a part which is rotated by the motor when the motor is energised means which, after the part has rotated through a certain angle, opens the motor circuit so that the motor is de energised an electrical indicator circuit containing a lamp and means responsive to the motor when energised for periodically closing the indicator circuit and causing the lamp to flash. Since the motor is de energised after the rotatable part has been rotated through a certain angle, for example up to one revolution, the flashing of the warning lamp only occurs for a limited period. The rotary part may be, for example, a cam, which operates a switch in the motor circuit. In a particularly convenient construction, however, the rotatable part is formed by a movable conductor wheel which is movable bodily into contact with a second conductor wheel to close the motor circuit and is thereupon rotated by the second wheel, which is itself rotated by the motor. The reopening of the motor circuit, after the first wheel has been rotated through a certain angle, may then be provided by an insulating portion at the periphery of the first wheel so that the motor circuit is opened when the first wheel has been rotated until the insulating portion engages the second wheel. To ensure that a conducting portion at the periphery of the first wheel will engage the second wheel during the next cycle, a ratchet wheel may be fixed coaxially with the first wheel for engagement with a pawl whereby the pawl turns the ratchet wheel and first wheel through a small angle during movement of the first wheel away from and back to the second wheel between successive cycles. The first wheel may be mounted on a carriage which is arranged to be coupled mechanically to the accelerator pedal. For example, there may be a tension element which, when the accelerator pedal is depressed, pulls the carriage, to move the first wheel away from the second wheel, against the action of a spring, the spring urging the carriage to move to carry the first wheel back into contact with the second wheel when the pedal is released. The means for periodically closing the indicator circuit may comprise a conductor member which is rotated by the motor when energised and has around its axis of rotation alternating conducting and insulating portions and a contact which bears against the member and alternately engages these portions. In a particularly compact construction, the conductor member is the second conductor wheel and the insulating portions are provided at a face of the wheel. An example of a device constructed in accordance with the present invention is illustrated disgratsaically in the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a perspective view Figure 2 is a side elevation, partially in section and, Figure 3 is a plan. As shown in the drawings, the device is installed on a base board 5. A carriage 23, carrying a coaxial assembly of conductor wheel 21 and ratchet wheel 22, is movable to and fro along an upstanding longitudinally slotted guide 231 and is urged to the left, as shown in Figure 2, by a spring 25. A tension element 10, in this case a wire, couples a base part 24, carried by the carriage beneath the base plate 5, to a control rod 11 of an accelerator pedal of a vehicle to which the device is fitted.When the accelerator pedal is depressed, the wire 10 pulls the carriage to the right against the action of the spring 25, and when the accelerator pedal is released, the carriage moves to the left under the action of the spring 25. Towards the end of this movement of the carriage towards the left, the teeth of the ratchet wheel 22 are engaged by a spring strip 45 forming a pawl, so that the ratchet wheel 22 and with it the conductor wheel 21, are rotated through a small angle until the movement of the carriage to the left is completed when the periphery of the wheel 21 cones into contact with the periphery of a second conductor wheel 41. The wheel 41 is mounted on the output shaft of a reduction gearbox 32, the input gear of which is mounted on the driven shaft of an electric motor 31. As illustrated diagrammatically in Figure 3, the motor 31 is connected in an electrical circuit 52, containing the conductor wheels 21 and 41, and also a power source 60. The engagement and disengagement of the wheels 21 and 41 effectively forms a switch which closes and opens the circuit 52, to energise and de energise the motor 31, respectively. Inset in one face of the conductor wheel 41 are a number of equiangularly spaced insulating disc portions 411,412,413. At a corresponding radius this face of the wheel 41 is engaged by a spring loaded contact 44 carried by a fixed tubular conductor 43, which is mounted on an insulating support 42. As the wheel 41 is rotated, via the gearbox 32, when the motor 31 is energised, a circuit 50, containing a lamp 51, is alternately opened and closed as the contact 44 runs alternately over conducting portions of the wheel 41 and the insulating discs 411 etc. It will be appreciated that the motor 31 and the lamp 51 are. in parallel with one another, that the switch formed by the wheels 21 and 41 is in the motor circuit 52 that the switch formed by the contact 44 and the wheel 41 is in the indicator circuit 50 but that the indicator circuit 50 also includes the switch formed by the wheels 21 and 41, in series with the switch formed by the contact 44 and the wheel 41. With this construction, when the car is being driven normally, i.e. the accelerator pedal is depressed, the wire 10 draws the carriage 23 to the right in Figure 2, so that both circuits are de energised, owing to the disengagement of the conductor wheels 21 and 41. Whenever the driver starts to decelerate, by releasing the accelerator pedal, the wire 10 is slackened by movement of the control rod 11 so that the carriage 23 is free to move to the left in Figure 2 under the action of the spring 25 until the conductor wheel 21 comes into engagement with the wheel 41 and closes the motor circuit 52. The motor then starts running and rotates the wheel 41 which in turn, via the contact 44, intermittently closes the indicator circuit 50 and intermittently energises the lamp 51 which flashes to give the warning of the intending deceleration.At the same time the wheel 41 rotates the wheel 21, owing to meshing teeth or other frictional engagement at their peripheries. This rotation of the wheel 21 continues until an insulating insert 211 in a recess in the periphery of the wheel 21 comes into engagement with the wheel 41, thereby opening the circuits and de energising both the motor and the lamp. When the driver accelerates again, the control rod pulls on the wire 10 which draws the carriage 23 to the right, as seen in Figure 2, again, bringing the wheels 21 and 41 out of engagement with one another. When the accelerator pedal is next released, upon the next impending deceleration, the carriage 23 moves back to the left, as shown in Figure 2, and as it does so the pawl 45 rotates the ratchet wheel 22 and hence the conductor wheel 21 so that the insulating insert 211 is no longer in alignment with the adjacent peripheral portion of the wheel 41. when the wheel 21 then moves into engagement with the wheel 41, the motor circuit is reclosed, and hence the wheel 41 rotated and the lamp 51 energised intermittently. The device is therefore simple in structure and economic in application, and provides the excellent effect of a prompt flashing signal in response to impending deceleration of a vehicle to which the device is fitted, thereby warning the drivers of other cars to take effective safety measures.
