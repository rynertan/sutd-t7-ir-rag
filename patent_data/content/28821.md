# Method of improving the ductility of the coating of an aluminum zinc alloy coated ferrous product.

## Abstract
This invention relates to an aluminum zinc alloy coated ferrous product whose coating is highly ductile, and to the method whereby such improved coating ductility may be realized. The process is characterized by the steps of ther mally treating the aluminum zinc alloy coated product by heating to a temperature between about 200 F 93 C and 800 F 427 C and holding for a period of time to effect metal lurgical structure changes, among them being the precipita tion of a second phase incoherent with the matrix, followed by slow cooling to at least 400 F 205 C . The resulting product is characterized by an aluminum zinc alloy coating with a hard ness no greater than about 115 VHN, and preferably no grea ter than about 110 VHN.
