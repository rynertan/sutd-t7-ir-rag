## Description
RANDOM 1 BUTENE COPOLYMER This invention relates to a novel random l butene copolymer having excellent utility. More specifically, it relates to a l butene random copolymer having excellent transparency, surface non tackiness, tensile properties and other properties, which is suitable for the production of packaging films or sheets or other melt molded articles having excellent transparency, antiblocking property, etc. Heretofore, vinyl chloride resins have predominantly been used in the field of molding flexible or semirigid resins, but because of the evolution of corrosive gases during their incineration after discharging and the suspected safety of residual monomers or plasticizers therein, it has been desired to replace them by olefinic flexible or semirigid resins. Olefinic copolymers such as ethylene copolymers, propylene copolymers, and l butene copolymers have recently been utilized in the field of molding such flexible or semirigid resins. Many proposals have been made on flexible l butene random copolymers composed of l butene as a main component and propylene. U. S. Patents Nos. 3278504, 3332921 and 4168361, British Patents Nos. 1,018,341 and 1,084,953 and Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No.38787 1975 corresponding to U. S. Patent No. 3,923,758 disclose l butene random copolymers produced by using titanium trichloride or titanium tetrachloride catalysts. The above cited U. S. Patent No. 3,278,504 describes that a proDvlene l butene copolymer having a 1butene content of 30 to 70 mole is produced by using titanium tetrachoride found or titanium trichloride. The present inventors have found, however, that the copolymer produced with such a catalyst system is a flexible resin which has a boiling methyl acetate soluble content of more than 2 by weight and a high acetone n decane mixture 1 1 by volume soluble content, surface tackiness, and inferior transparency. The above cited U. S. Patent No. 3,332,921 andBritish Patent No. 1,084,953 propose various l butene Co polymers having varying l butene contents which are produced by using a titanium trichloride catalyst. The present inventors, however, have found that among these l butene copolymers, those having a l butene content of 60 to 99 mole have the same disadvantages as the l butene copolymer described in the above cited U. S. Patent No. 3,278,504. In the above cited British Patent No. 1,018,341, copolymers having a l butene content of 25 to 90 mole are prepared by using a catalyst comprising a transition metal halide such as titanium trichloride and a derivative of phosphoric acid. The present inventors, however, have found that among the copolymers specifically disclosed in this British Patent, those having a 1 butene content of 50 to 90 mole have an acetone soluble content of at least 1.5 by weight. Investigations of the present inventors have shown that these copolymers have a boiling methyl acetatesoluble content of more than 2 by weight and an acetone n decane mixed solvent 1 1 by volume soluble content of more than 5 x ri 1 2 and that these l butene copolymers give molded articles having high surface tackiness and inferior transparency. The above cited U. S. Patent No. 4ref68,361 discloses propylene l butene copolymers having a propylene content of 40 to 90 mole . Investigations of the present inventors, however, have shown that among these copolymers, those having a l butene content of 50 to 60 mole have a high acetone n decane mixed solvent soluble content, and only give molded articles having high surface tackiness and inferior transparency. The above cited Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 38787 1975 proposes a process for producing an amorphous random l butene propylene copolymer by per form ing polymerization at high temperatures using a titanium trichloride type catalyst. The present inventors, howevver, have found that these copolymers have a methyl acetatesoluble content of more than 2 by weight, and inferior tensile properties. Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 85293 1979 describes a random l butene propylene copolymer containing l butene as a main component which has a narrow composition distribution, a low boiling methyl acetatesoluble content and low surface tackiness. The content of low molecular weight components in this l butene propylene copolymer, particularly the content of a low molecularweight polymer represented by the boiling methyl acetatesoluble content, and the surface tackiness of a molded article prepared from this copolymer are considerably improved over those of l butene copolymer obtained by a catalyst system comprising titanium trichloride or titanium tetrachloride.The present inventors, however, have found that the content of the low molecular weight polymer in the l butene random copolymer, especially the content of the low molecular weight polymer represented by the acetone n decane mixed solvent 1 1 by volume soluble content, is still high, and that a molded article, such as a film, of a resin composition obtained by incorporating the above random l butene propylene copolymer in a polypropylene resin for improved impact strength, tends to increase in surface tackiness with time, and is still unsatisfactory in applications which require high levels of transparency and surface non tackiness. The present inventors recognized that conventional random l butene type copolymers have a high low molecularweight polymer content and molded articles obtained from these copolymers have inferior surface non tackiness, transparency and dynamical properties such as rigidity. On the basis of this recognition, the present inventors have conducted a research and development work in order to provide a random l butene copolymer improved in these properties over the conventional random l butene copolymer. Consequently, the present inventors succeeded in synthesizing a novel random 1 butene copolymer composed of l butene as a main component and an alpha olefin having 2 to 20 carbon atoms and having the characteristic values A to I defined below. It has also been found that this novel 1 butene random copolymer has a low content of a low molecular weight polymer component, particularly that represented by both its boiling methyl acetate soluble content and an acetone ndecane mixed solvent 1 1 by volume soluble content, and that a molded article obtained from this random 1 butene copolymer is particularly superior in surface non tackiness, transparency and dynamical properties such as rigidity. It is an object of this invention to provide a novel random l butene copolymer composed of a major proportion of l butene and a minor proportion of an alpha olefin having 5 to 20 carbon atoms. According to this invention, there is provided a random l butene copolymer composed of l butene and an alpha olefin having 5 to 20 carbon atoms, said random 1butene copolymer being characterized by the following characteristics A to F , A it comprises 50 to 99 mole of l butene component and 1 to 50 mole of the alpha olefin component, B it has an intrinsic viscosity n , measured in decalin at 135 C, of from 0.5 to 6 dl g, C it has a melting point Tm , measured by a differential scanning calorimeter, of from 30 to 120 C, D it has a crystallinity, measured by X ray diffractometry, of from 5 to 60 , E the amount lWl in by weight of that portion of it which is soluble in boiling methyl acetate is not more than 2t, and F the amount W2 in by weight of that portion of it which is soluble in a 1 1 by volume mixture of acetone and n decane at 100C is less than 5 x n 1.2 In the random l butene copolymer of this invention, the composition A of the copolymer is such that the proportion of the l butene component is in the range of 50 to 99 mole , preferably 60 to 98 mole , more preferably 70 to 98 mole , and the proportion of the alpha olefin component having 5 to 20 carbon atoms is in the range of 1 to 50 mole , preferably 2 to 40 mole , more preferably 2 to 30 mole . If the content of the l butene component in the copolymer is less than 50 mole , the surface non tackiness and tensile properites of the copolymer are reduced. If it exceeds 99 mole , the transparfency of the copolymer is reduced. Examples of the alpha olefin component having 5 to 20 carbon atoms include l pentene, l hexene, 4 methyl 1 pentene, 3 methyl 1 pentene, l octene, l decene, l dodecene, l tetradecene, l hexadecene, l octadecene and l eicosene. In the present invention, the l butene content of the copolymer is measured by 13C NMR. The random l butene copolymer of this invention has an intrinsic viscosity ri B , determined in decalin at 135 0C, of 0.5 to 6 dl g, preferably 1 to 5 dl g, especially preferably 1.5 to 3.5 dl g. The intrinsic viscosity is a meausure of the molecular weight of the copolymer of the invention. The melting point C , measured by a differential scanning calorimeter, of the copolymer of this invention to be sometimes abbreviated as the DSC melting point is 30 to 1200C, preferably 40 to 115 C. The DSC melting point in the above specific range, in combination with the other characteristic values, serves to provide the copolymer having the aforesaid excellent properties. The DSC melting point is measured as follows A 0.1 mm thick press sheet taken 20 hours after its molding is subjected to differential scanning calorimetry at a temperature raising rate of 10 0C min. over a range of 0 to 200 0C, and the maximum endothermic peak is determined and defined as Tm. The crytallinity D of the l butene random copolymer measured by X ray diffractometry is in the range of 5 to 60 , preferably 10 to 55 . This characteristic value is a measure of the excellency of the tensile properties of the copolymer of the invention, and in combination with the other characteristic values, serves to provide the random copolymer having the aforesaid excellent properties. The crystallinity is determined by X ray diffractometry using a 1.5 mm thick press sheet taken 20 hours after its molding. The amount iW1 in by weight E of that portion of the l butene random copolymer soluble in boiling methyl acetate is not more than 2 by weight, for example 0.01 to 2 by weight, preferably 0.02 to 1 by weight. The amount W1 is preferably within the range represented by the following formulae. 0.01 W1 0.02a 1.0 more preferably 0.02 W1 0.015a 0.7 especially preferably 0.03 W1 0.01a 0.5 In the above formulae a represents the content in mole of the alpha olefin component in the l butene copolymer. This characteristic value represents the content of a low molecular weight polymer component in the random l butene copolymer of this invention, and is a measure of the breadths of the composition distribution and molecular weight distribution of the copolymer. In combination with the other characteristic values, it serves to provide the copolymer having the aforesaid excellent properties. The w1 is measured by the following method. A polymer sample having a size of about 1 mm x 1 mm x lmm is put in a cylindrical glass filter, and extracted for 7 hours by a Soxhlet extractor at a reflux frequency of about 1 per 5 minutes. The extraction residue is dried in a vacuum dryer degree of vacuum less than 10 mmHg and its weight is measured. The weight of that portion which dissolves in boiling methyl acetate is determined from a weight difference from the original sample. W1 is the percentage of the weight of the boiling methyl acetate soluble portion based on the weight of the original sample. The amount W2 in by weight F of that portion of the 1 butene type copolymer which dissolves at 10 C in a mixture of acetone and n decane is less than 5 x 1.2 by weight, for example, 0.1 x ln 1.2 to 5 x ln 1.2 by weight, preferably 0.2 x 1.2 to 4 x 1.2 by weight, especially preferably 0.3 x 1.2 to 3 x 1.2 by weight, based on the weight of the copolymer. 9 used herein means the intrinsic viscosity value of the copolymer. This characteristic value represents the content of a low molecularweight polymer component in the random l butene copolymer of this invention and is a measure of the breadths of the composition distribution and molecular weight distribution of the copolymer. In combination with the other characteristic values, this characteristic value serves to provide the copolymer having the aforesaid excellent properties.The W2 value is determined as follows One gram of a copolymer sample, 0.05 g of 2,6 ditert butyl 4 methylphenol and 50 ml of n decane are put in a 150 ml flask equipped with stirring vanes and dissolved on an oil bath at 120 0C. After the dissolving, the solution is allowed to cool spontaneously at room temperature for 30 minutes. Then, 50 ml of acetone is added over 30 seconds, and the solution is cooled on a water bath at 10 0C for 60 minutes. The precipitated copolymer was separated from the solution containing a low molecular weight polymer component by filtration on a glass filter. The solution is dried at 150 0C and 10 mmHg until its weight becomes constant. The weight of the dried product is measured.The amount of the copolymer which dissolved in the mixed solvent is calculated as the percentage of the weight of the original sample copolymer. In the above method, the stirring is continuously effected from the time of dissolution until immediately before the filtration. Further, the random l butene copolymer of this invention preferably may be a yield strength G , measured by the method of JIS K 7113, of 10 to 200 kg cm2, more preferably 20 to 150 kg cm2, a tensile strength at break H , measured by the method of JIS K 7113, of 100 to 1000 kg cm2, more preferably 120 to 600 kg cm2, and an elongation at break I , measured by the method of JIS K 7113, of at least 300 , more preferably 500 to 15008, The yield strength G , the tensile strength at break z and the elongation at break I are measured by the testing methods of JIS K 7113. Specifically, a 1 mm thick press sheet is molded by the method of JIS K 6758, and 19 hours after the molding, a test sample No. 2 in accordance with JIS K 7113 is punched out from the press sheet. The above properties of the test sample were measured at a stretching speed of 50 mm min. in an atmosphere kept at 25 0C 20 hours after the molding of the press sheet. When no clear yield point appears, a stress at 20 elongation is taken as the yield strength. The random l butene copolymer of this invention preferably also satisfies the characteristic values J to L below. The random l butene copolymer has a torsional rigidity J , measured by the method of JIS K 6745, of, for example, 100 to 2000 kg cm2, preferably 150 to 1500 kg cm2.The torsional rigidity is measured as follows A 1 mm thick press sheet is molded in accordance with JIS R6758, and 9 days after the molding, a rectangular test sample, 64 mm long and 635 mm wide, is punched out from the press sheet. Ten days after the molding of the press sheet, a load is applied to the test sample in an atmosphere kept at 25 0C at a torsion angle of 50 to 60 degrees, and 5 seconds later, the rigidity of the sample is measured. The random l butene copolymer has a Young s modulus K , measured in accordance with the method of JISK 7113, of, for example, 200 to 4000 kg cmê, preferably 300 to 3000 kg cmê. Preferably, the Young s modulus K of the l butene random copolymer is expressed by the following formula in relation to the alpha olefin content b mole of the copolymer. 3000 30b K 1000 15b The Young s modulus is measured by the same tensile test as in the testing of G , H and I . The standard deviation ç L of the l butene content of the random l butene copolymer is usually not more than 0.4a mole , preferably not more than 0.3a mole a represents the C5 C20 alpha olefin content in mole of the random l butene copolymer . The standard deviation a is a measure of the randomness of the l butene random copolymer.A copolymer of this invention which may satisfy the characteristic value L as well as the characteristic values A to F shows better properties. The standard deviation value o of the l butene random copolymer of this invention is determined by the following equation based on the composition distribution of the copolymer. The composition distribution of the copolymer is measured by an extraction type column fractionation method in which p xylene is used as a solvent and the extraction temperature is changed stepwise from 0 to 1300C at 50C intervals. Extraction at a given temperature is carried out for 4 hours by using 2 liters of p xylene per 10 g of the copolymer sample.EMI9.1 wherein x represents the average content in mole of l butene in the copolymer, x represents the l butene content mole , and f x represents the differential weight fraction of a component having the l butene content of x mole , The random l butene copolymer of this invention is characterized by undergoing little changes in physical properties with time because its crystal type is fixed atII. It is known on the other hand that a bomopolymer of l butene has three crystal types and crystal transition among them occurs with variations in temperature or time.In particular, since transition from a quasi stable II type crystal form to a stable I type crystal form at room temperature is slow, its molding encounters with various difficulties such as deformation of molded articles, and changes of their properties with time. The random l butene copolymer of this invention may have other minor amounts of alpha olefins such as ethylene or propylene, copolymerized therewith so long as the additional comonomers do not impair the various properties of the copolymer. The random l butene random copolymer can be prepared, for example, by copolymerizing l butene and the C5 C20 alpha olefin at a temperature of about 20 to about 0 200 C in the presence of a catalyst prepared, for example, from a a highly active titanium catalyst component containing magnesium, tianium, halogen and a diester component as essential ingredients and prepared by reacting a magnesium compound, a titanium compound and a diester and optionally a halogen compound not always necessary when the magnesium or titanium compound contains a halogen atom , b an organoaluminum compound, and c an organic silicon compound catalyst component having an Si O C bond. In the production of the l butene random copolymer, the catalyst and the polymerization conditions may be selected by preliminary experiments so that it satisfies the characteristics A to F . Since the existence of the novel random l butene copolymer having the specific characteristic values not described in the prior literature has been clarified by the present invention, the conditions for producing the random l butene copolymer of this invention can be experimentally set easily and properly chosen by using the characteritic values A to I and the auxiliary characteristic values J to L as a measure. The titanium catalyst component a is prepared preferably by contacting a magnesium compound or magnesium metal , a titanium compound and a diester or a diesterforming compound with or without other reagents. The preparation can be effected in the same way as in the preparation of known highly active titanium catalyst components containing magnesium, titanium, halogen and an electron donor as essential ingredients. For example, it can be produced in accordance with the methods disclosed in BritishPatent Specifications Nos. 1492618, 1554340 and 1554248,U. S. Patents Nos. 4157435, 4076924, 4085276, 4250285, 4232139, 4143223, 4315874, 4330649, 4401589 and 4335015, andEuropean Patent Specification No. 22675.

Copolymerization of l butene with the C5 C20 alpha olefin can be carried out either in the liquid phase or in the vapor phase. Preferably, it is carried out in the liquid phase under such conditions that the copolymer dissolves in the liquid phase. When the copolymeriztion is to be carried out in the liquid phase, an inert solvent such as hexane, heptane or kerosene may be used as a reaction medium, but the olefins themselves may be used as the reaction medium. The amount of the catalyst used is such that per liter of the volume of the reaction zone, the proportion of component a is about 0.0001 to about 1.0 millimole as titanium atom, the proportion of component b is about 1 to about 2000 moles, preferably about 5 to about 500 moles, as the metal atom per mole of the titanium atom in component a , and the proportion of component c , as the Si atom in component c , is about 0.001 to about 10 moles, preferably about 0.01 to about 2 moles, especially preferably about 0.05 to about 1 mole, per mole of the metal atom in component b .

To produce a random l butene copolymer having a l butene content of 99 to 50 mole , the ratios of l butene and the alpha olefin to be fed may be properly selected depending, for example, upon the polymerization pressure.For example, the mole ratio of l butene alpha olefin is from about 0.01 to about 100. The molecular weight may be controlled to some extent by varying such polymerization conditions as the polymerization temperature and the proportions of the catalyst components used.
