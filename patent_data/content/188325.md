## Description
This invention is concerned with polymer particles made by sequential emulsion polymerisation and containing acid core polymer at least partially encapsulated in sheath polymer that is permeable to base to swell the core. Polymer particles so formed are useful as opacifying agents in coating, impregnating, and molding compositions. In our European Patent No. 0022633 we disclose a process for making polymer particles by a sequentially emulsion polymerizing a core monomer system comprising at least one carboxylic acid monomer to form a core polymer dispersion and at least partially encapsulating each core particle with a sheath by b polymerizing in the presence of the core polymer dispersion a sheath monomer system, said sheath being permeable to aqueous volatile base selected from ammonia and amines and c swelling said core with ammonia or amine so as to form particles which, when dried, contain a single void. Compositions in which such polymer particles are contained may be opaque. The composition of the sheath polymer is such as to render it permeable at room temperature or at moderately elevated temperature, to a volatile neutralizing base, such as ammonia, or a lower aliphatic amine, e.g. triethylamine or triethanolamine. When the polymer particle is subsequently dried, the volatile base is at least partially removed by volatilization. In certain applications the presence of such volatile bases is undesirable because of odor problems when the neutralizing base volatilises off. Furthermore, sheath compositions referred to in our European Patent No. 0022633 are either impermeable or of very low permeability to fixed or permanent bases. For this reason it was believed that the use of fixed or permanent bases as swelling agents for the acid core polymer was undesirable. However, we have now found polymer particles which do not suffer from such undesirable odor problems and have improved permeability to fixed or permanent bases. In accordance with the present invention we provide a process for making void containing polymer particles useful as opacifiers comprising In another aspect, the invention comprises compositions comprising core sheath polymer particles prepared by said process, and articles which are coated with, impregnated with, or molded with the compositions. The core polymer may be the product of aqueous emulsion polymerization of one or more monoethylenically unsaturated monomers containing a group of the formula HC C and a carboxylic acid group. Suitable ethylenically unsaturated monomers containing acid functionality include acrylic acid and methacrylic acid hereafter the expression meth acrylic acid is intended to serve as a generic expression embracing both acrylic acid and methacrylic acid , which are preferred, and meth acryloxypropionic acid, itaconic acid, aconitic acid, maleic acid or anhydride, fumaric acid, crotonic acid, monomethyl maleate, monomethyl fumarate, and monomethyl itaconate. The core polymer may be obtained by the emulsion homopolymerization of such an acid monomer or by copolymerization of two or more acid monomers. However, in preferred embodiments, an acid monomer or a mixture of acid monomers is copolymerized with one or more ethylenically unsaturated monomers of non ionic character that is, having no ionizable group having one or more ethylenic unsaturated groups of the formula H Examples of non ionic monoethylenically unsaturated monomers include styrene, vinyltoluene, ethylene, vinyl acetate, vinyl chloride, vinylidene chloride, acrylonitrile, meth acrylamide, various C The core polymer may comprise as one component thereof a small amount of a polyethylenically unsaturated monomer, such as ethylene glycol di meth acrylate, allyl meth acrylate, 1,3 butane diol di meth acrylate, diethylene glycol di meth acrylate, trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate, or divinylbenzene, the proportion thereof being in the range of 0.1 to 20 , preferably 0.1 to 3 , by weight, based on the total monomer weight of the core, the amount used generally being approximately directly proportional to the amount of acid monomer used. Butadiene is exceptional in that it often functions as a mono ethylenically unsaturated monomer especially in mixtures with styrene so the amount of butadiene, if used, may be as much as 30 to 60 percent by weight of the total core monomer weight. While the core may be made in a single stage or step of the sequential polymerization and the sheath may be the product of a single sequential stage or step following the core stage, nevertheless, the making of the core component may involve a plurality of steps in sequence followed by the making of the sheath which may involve a series of sequential steps as well. Thus, the first stage of emulsion polymerization in the process of the present invention may be the preparation of a seed polymer consisting of small dispersed polymer particles insoluble in the aqueous emulsion polymerization medium. This seed polymer may contain any acid component but provides particles of minute size which form the nuclei on which the core polymer of acid monomer, with or without non ionic comonomer s , is formed. As is common to aqueous emulsion polymers, there is used a water soluble free radical initiator, such as hydrogen peroxide, tert butyl peroxide, or an alkali metal e.g. sodium, potassium or lithium or ammonium persulfate or a mixture of such an initiator with a reducing agent, such as a sulfite, more specifically an alkali metal metabisulfite, hydrosulfite, or hyposulfite, or sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate, to form a redox system. The amount of initiator may be from 0.01 to 2 by weight of the monomer charged in a redox system, a corresponding range 0.01 to 2 of reducing agent may be used. The temperature may be in the range of 10 C. to 100 C. In the case of the persulfate systems, the temperature is preferably in the range of 60 to 90 C. In the redox system, the temperature is preferably in the range of 30 to 70 C., preferably below 60 C., more preferably in the range of 30 45 C. The proportion of emulsifier may be zero, in the situation wherein a persulfate initiator is used, to 0.3 weight percent, based on the weight of monomer charged to the first stage of polymerization. By carrying out the emulsion polymerization while maintaining low levels of emulsifier, the subsequent stages of polymer formation deposit the most recently formed polymer on the existing dispersed polymer particles resulting from the preceding step or stage. As a general rule, the amount of emulsifier should be kept below that corresponding to the critical micelle concentration for a particular monomer system, but while this limitation is preferable and produces a unimodal product, it has been found that in some systems the critical micelle concentration of the emulsifier may be exceeded somewhat without the formation of an objectionable or excessive number of disperse micelles or particles. Any non ionic or anionic emulsifier may be used, either alone or together. Examples of the non ionic type of emulsifier include tert octylphenoxyethylpoly 39 ethoxyethanol, and nonylphenoxyethylpoly 40 ethoxyethanol. Examples of anionic emulsifiers include sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate, and tert octylphenoxyethylpoly 39 ethoxyethyl sulfate, sodium salt. The viscosity average molecular weight of the polymer formed in a given stage may range from 100,000, or lower if a chain transfer agent is used, to several million. When 0.1 to 20 weight of a polyethylenically unsaturated monomer mentioned hereinbefore is used in making the acid polymer, the molecular weight is increased whether or not crosslinking occurs. The use of the polyethylenically unsaturated monomer reduces the tendency of the core polymer to dissolve when the multistage polymer is treated with a swellant for the core. If it is desired to produce an acid polymer having a molecular weight in the lower part of the range, such as from 500,000 down to as low as about 20,000, it is frequently most practical to do so by avoiding the polyethylenically unsaturated monomers and using a chain transfer agent instead, such as 0.05 to 2 or more thereof, examples being a lower alkyl mercaptan, such as sec butyl mercaptan. The acid containing core polymer, whether obtained by a single stage process or a process involving several stages, has an average size of 0.05 to 1.0, preferably 0.1 to 0.5, more preferably 0.1 to 0.3 µm diameter in unswollen condition. If the core is obtained from a seed polymer, whether or not the latter contains acid groups or mers, the seed polymer may have an average size in the range of 0.03 to 0.2 µm diameter. After the acid core is obtained, a subsequent stage or stages of emulsion polymerization is effected to form a sheath polymer on the acid core polymer particles or micelles. This may be performed in the same reaction vessel in which the formation of the core was accomplished or the reaction medium containing the dispersed core particles may be transferred to another reaction container. It is generally unnecessary to add emulsifier unless a polymodal product is desired, but in certain monomer emulsifier systems for forming the sheath the tendency to produce gum or coagulum in the reaction medium may be reduced or prevented by the addition of 0.05 to 0.5 by weight, based on sheath forming monomer weight, of emulsifier without detriment to the deposition of the polymer formed on the previously formed core particles. The swelling of the particle is performed with fixed or permanent base at a temperature of 50 to 100 C and or in the presence of a solvent when the content of acid monomer in the sheath is up to 2 by weight solvent is used, but when the content of acid monomer is 5 to 10 by weight solvent is not used. Our European Patent No. 0022633 did not mention use of a solvent for swelling. Furthermore the presence of acid functional monomer in said sheath monomer system enables the resultant hard sheath to be penetrated by fixed or permanent bases especially at elevated temperature. It is preferred that the sheath monomer system be all acrylic, and in one particularly preferred embodiment the sheath monomer system comprises butyl methacrylate and methyl methacrylate and 1 to 10 by weight methacrylic acid. The temperature range at which the sheath is permeable to the fixed or permanent base and swelling the core with said base takes place is 50 C. to 100 C., preferably 80 to 90 C. The amount of acid functional monomer in said sheath monomer system is 5 to 10 by weight when solvent is not used, and up to 2 by weight when solvent is used. The solvent, when used, assists in penetration of the shell by the fixed or permanent base. Suitable amounts of solvent are 1 to 100 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight core sheath polymer, preferably 5 10 parts by weight. Suitable solvents are any which will plasticize the shell, for example, hexanol, ethanol, 3 hydroxy 2,2,4 trimethylpentyl isobutyrate, toluene and mixtures of solvents. The solvent can be added either before, after, or with the addition of the base. In certain cases the sheath monomer system itself can function as the solvent for the sheath monomer system. Suitable fixed or permanent bases are potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, zinc, copper, or silver ammonium complexes, or strontium and barium hydroxides. It is preferred that at least one additional sheath is polymerized subsequent to the swelling step, and a preferred monomer system for said additional sheath is styrene. The amount of polymer deposited to form sheath polymer is generally such as to provide an overall size of the multistage polymer particle of about 0.07 to about 4.5 µm, preferably about 0.1 to about 3.5 µm, more preferably about 0.2 to about 2.0 µm, in unswollen condition that is, before any neutralization to raise the pH to about 6 or higher whether the sheath polymer is formed in a single stage or in a plurality of stages. In unswollen state, the ratio of core weight to the total weight on average is from 1 4 to 1 100, preferably 1 8 to 1 50. After volatilization of the water from the enlarged, swollen particle, to produce a microvoid therein, the ratio of void volume to total volume of the particle on average should be from 5 to 95 and preferably is at least 15 . Generally, a single void is formed in each particle. The multistage heterogeneous particulate polymer containing the acid core is swollen when the particles are subjected to an aqueous basic swellant that permeates the sheath and expands the core, which expansion may involve partial merging of the outer periphery of the core into the pores of the inner periphery of the sheath and also partial enlargement or bulging of the sheath and the entire particle overall. When the swellant is removed by drying, the shrinkage of the core tends to develop a microvoid, the extent of which depends on the resistance of the sheath to restoration to its previous size. The monomer or monomers of the sheath may be selected to produce a sheath polymer having a relatively moderate to high glass transition temperature or inflection temperature which is found by plotting the modulus of rigidity against temperature. A convenient method for determining modulus of rigidity and transition temperature is described by I. Williamson, British Plastics 23, 87 90, 102 September 1950 . The T The core is preferably relatively hard, as indicated by calculated or measured core T It is preferred, for formation of microvoids, to select the monomer or monomers and the relative proportions thereof in the sheath producing stage to produce a sheath polymer having a T In another preferred embodiment the sheath is crosslinked by including in the monomer mixture used for forming the sheath 1 to 50 by weight, based on the total monomer weight in the mixture, of a polyethylenically unsaturated monomer such as one of those mentioned hereinbefore for making the core polymer. The crosslinking of the sheath serves to render it more stable structurally so that on drying the swollen particles to remove swellant, the shrinkage of the swollen core produces microvoids therein but the sheath resists collapse so that the mocrovoids formed are essentially retained within the particle which also remains essentially in spherical shape. One method involving the formation of a crosslinked sheath is to swell the dispersed polymer particles by neutralization of the acid containing core just before the stage of polymerizing the crosslinked phase of the sheath, or before completion of this stage when the content of polyethylenically unsaturated monomer therein is over 5 weight percent of the monomer mixture used therein, so that the last mentioned stage is carried out on the swollen particles and favors retention of the structure when voids are produced on subsequent removal of swellant. In this last mentioned embodiment wherein the sheath is crosslinked, this may be effected in a single sheath forming stage or it may be effected by using a multistage sheath forming procedure in which the polyethylenically unsaturated crosslinking monomer is omitted from the first sheath forming monomer mixture but is included in the monomer mixture used in a later stage, such as the second or third stage. It is remarkable that even in this multistage procedure, the crosslinking frequently occurs at the interface between the acid core and the surrounding sheath so that the expanded structure of the sheath tends to be maintained, thereby favoring the development of microvoids in the core. The multi stage core sheath polymer dispersions of the present invention are useful for aqueous coating and impregnating compositions as opacifying agents in such compositions either as a supplement to, or replacement of pigmentary matter and or extenders therefor. For these purposes, the aqueous dispersions of the core sheath polymer may be added directly to the coating and or impregnating compositions. Alternatively, the core sheath polymers may be isolated from the dispersions, after swelling of their cores, by filtration or decantation, and then the swellant may be removed, as by drying or volatilization, under conditions such that microvoids are formed and retained in the individual polymer particles or granules, the latter being more or less free flowing in character so that they con be packaged, sold and shipped or stored before use. The dry powder thus obtained can also be used in coatings based on organic solvents provided the sheath component of the core sheath particles is not soluble in the organic solvent. In one modification, the acidic core sheath polymer particles having a T Besides being useful in water based paints based on vinyl or acrylic polymer latices or aqueous solutions of vinyl or acrylic polymers, to replace all or part of opacifying pigments heretofore used, especially those of titanium dioxide, the microvoid containing particulate polymers of the present invention may be used for similar purposes in other coating systems including resin forming condensation products of thermosetting type, such as phenoplasts and aminoplasts, including urea formaldehyde and melamine formaldehyde, and other condensates, e.g., water dispersible alkyd resins. In addition, polymodal heteropolymers of the present invention having a predominant proportion of the microvoid containing large mode and a relatively minor proportion of a small mode can serve not only the opacifying function of the main large mode but also provide an adhesion promoting action by way of the small mode or modes. In the following examples which are illustrative of the invention, the parts and percentages are by weight and temperatures are in degrees Celsius, unless otherwise stated. A 5 liter round bottomed flask was equipped with paddle stirrer, thermometer, nitrogen inlet and reflux condenser. To 2080 g. of deionized water heated to 80 C was added 5.5 g. of sodium persulfate followed by 345 g. of an acrylic polymer dispersion 40 solids with an average particle size of 0.06 µm as the seed polymer. A monomer emulsion consisting of 55.5 g. of butyl acrylate, 610.5 g. of methyl methacrylate and 444 g. of methacrylic acid in 406 g. of water and 20 g. of sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate 23 was added over a 2 hour period. This resulting alkali swellable core is used as the seed polymer for the following reactions Table 1 shows the results of titrating all three samples Example 1 A C with 0.5N KOH at room temperature RT and the titration results with 0.5N HCl after all three samples had been heated at 85 C for 30 minutes with sufficient KOH to swell the core polymer inside the sheath. Table 1 illustrates the role that increasing the sheath acid plays in hard base e.g., KOH neutralization of the encapsulated core. The effect of added solvent is seen if sample A B 2 and 5 acid are treated with 50 on solids hexanol heated to 85 C then colled to RT and then titrated with 0.5 KOH. Both samples show complete uptake or titration of the core acid by the KOH. Additionally, both samples readily swell in the presence of KOH hexanol at 85 C. Example 1A was repeated except the ratio of core weight to sheath weight was 1 to 20 and the level of methacrylic acid was 3 . In a series of five experiments, A through E, 1.0 equivalent of 3 sodium hydroxide were used as the neutralizing agent in combination with, in the case of B, C, D, and E respectively, 10 of Texanol 3 hydroxy 2,2,4 trimethylyl pentyl isobutyrate , 1 hexanol, 1 pentanol or ethanol, based on weight of core shell polymer. Each of the mixtures in turn was heated to 90 C. for one hour. Scattering coefficients as in Example 2 were measured, with the results as shown in the following Table 3. Example 3 was repeated except that no methacrylic acid was present in the sheath and the ratio of BMA to MMA was 20 to 80. Using the same neutralization agent and solvent as in Examples 3A through E, respectively, the scattering coefficients were as shown in the following.
