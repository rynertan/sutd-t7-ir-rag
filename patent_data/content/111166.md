# Gate turn off thyristor.

## Abstract
A plurality of strip shaped emitter layers 5 on the cathode side are radially arranged on one main surface of the semiconductor substrate while forming a plurality of rings. A gate electrode 8 is in ohmic contact with a part of a base layer 4 which surrounds and is adjacent to each of said emitter layers on the cathode side. Between rings formed by said emitter layers on the cathode side, a ring shaped gate collecting electrode 80 is provided to be connected to said gate electrode. At this time, said gate collecting electrode is provided at such a position as to balance the potential differences produced by gate currents respectively corres ponding to side and outside of said gate collecting electrode.
