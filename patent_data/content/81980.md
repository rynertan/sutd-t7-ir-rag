## Description
SYSTEMS FOR DETERMINING THE EFFICIENCY OF FOSSIL FUEL FIRED VAPOUR GENERATORS This invention relates to systems for determining the efficiency of fossil fuel fired vapour generators. One technique for determining the efficiency of a fossil fuel fired steam generator, as set forth in the ASME ANSI Power Test Codes, is the so called Heat Loss Method which is based on the calculation of heat losses per unit weight e.g. pound of fuel. The generator efficiency is then the difference between the higher heating value of the fuel minus the total of the calculated heat losses, expressed in percent, for given feedwater conditions. A complete efficiency test of a fossil fuel fired steam generator as presently conducted requires many man hours of labour to record the required data at stipulated increments of time over an extended period of time and then to make the necessary calculations at each of several loads.Furthermore, to obtain meaningful results during the period of time in which the tests are conducted, the generator must be held in a steady state condition. For these reasons efficiency tests are usually conducted only when required to meet performance guarantees. With the foregoing in mind, this invention provides a system whereby the efficiency of a fossil fuel fired vapour generator may be automatically and continuously monitored. According to the present invention there is provided a system for the automatic and continuous determination of the efficiency of a fossil fuelfired vapour generator, the system comprising means for generating a first signal proportional to the weight units of dry exit flue gas per unit weight of fuel, means for generating a second signal corresponding to the temperature difference between the exit flue gas and air supplied for combustion, means for generating a third signal proportional to the specific heat of the dry exit flue gases, and means for generating a fourth signal proportional to the product of the first, second and third signals and to the heat loss in the dry flue gas in thermal units per unit weight of fuel. The invention will now be further described, by way of illustrative and non limiting example, with reference to the accompanying drawing, the sole figure of which is a logic diagram of a system embodying this invention. In the drawing, conventional logic symbols have been used. It will be recognised that the components, or hardware, as it is sometimes called, which such symbols represent are commercially available and their operation well understood by those familiar with the art. Further, conventional logic symbols have been used to avoid specific indentification of this invention with any particular type of components such as analog or digital, as this invention comprehends either one or a combination of such types. Referring now to the drawing, excess air in flue gas of a fossil fuelfired vapour generator is determined by means of an oxygen transducer 1 generating a signal transmitted to a function generator 2, an output signal from which is proportional to the total air supplied for combustion in percent by weight. There is a substantially constant relationship between oxygen content in the flue gas and total air regardless of the fuel being burned, particularly as in modern steam generators the excess air can be maintained at low values in the region of 20 percent or less. If required, however, the output signal from the function generator 2 may be adjusted to compensate for changes in the proportionality between oxygen content and total air occasioned by a change in fuel. A signal proportional to the weight units pounds of air supplied for combustion per unit weight pound of fuel is obtained by multiplying, in a multiplying unit 8, the signal from the function generator 2, by a signal prnpoftional to the theoretical air required in weight units pounds per unit weight pound of fuel, generated in a manually adjustable unit 10. Oxygen analysers of the so called electro chemical type using aZirconium oxide sensor operate at approximately 8150C 15000F . At this temperature unburned combustibles, such as CO and H2, react with the oxygen present in the flue gas. As a result, the signal generated by the oxygen transducer 1 is proportional to the excess oxygen remaining in the flue gas based on complete combustion. If such an oxygen transmitter is incorporated in the system, a correction to the output signal from the function generator 2 is made by dividing in half, by means of a divider unit 11 and a signal generator 15, the output signal from a function generator 13 responsive to the signal generated in a combustibles transducer 62. The output signal from the divider unit 11 is then summed in a summing unit 17 with a constant value signal generated in a signal generator 19.The output signal from the function generator 2 is then multiplied in a multiplier unit 21 producing an output signal proportional to the weight in pounds of dry air in weight units pounds per unit weight pound of fuel. If the oxygen transducer is of a type having an operating temperature below the temperature at which the unburned combustibles react with the oxygen present in the flue gas, such as the so called catalytic combustion or paramagnetic types, then no such correction is required. The weight units pounds of dry exit flue gas per unit weight pound of fuel is obtained by adding, in an adder unit 25, to the output signal from multiplier unit 8, a signal proportional to the weight of combustibles in a weight unit pound of fuel generated in a signal generator 27. Having thus obtained the weight units pounds of dry air and weight units pounds of dry flue gas per unit weight pound of fuel, the individual losses due to heat in the exit flue gas, moisture in the air supplied for combustion, sensible and latent heat in the H2O in the fuel and combustibles in the flue gas if any are determined as follows HEAT LOSS IN DRY FLUE GAS BTU lb OF FUEL 1 L1 Pounds Dry Flue Gas Pound Of Fuel x 0.247 x T t Where L1 Heat Loss in dry flue gas in BTU lb Fuel T Flue Gas Temperature OF t Ambient Temperature OF 0.247 Specific Heat of dry air in Btu lb OF at 14.7 lbf in2 absolute.It has been assumed that the specific heat of the dry flue mass is very nearly equal to the specific heat of dry air. A signal proportional to the difference in ambient and exit flue gas temperatures is generated in a difference unit 12 responsive to the output signal from an ambient temperature transducer 14 and a flue gas exit temperature transducer 16. The signal generated in the difference unit 12 is then multiplied in a multiplying unit 18 by the output signal from a signal generator 20 proportional to the specific heat of the dry flue gas. To obtain a signal proportional to the hat loss in the exit dry flue gas per unit weight pound of fuel the output signal from the multiplying unit 18 is multiplied in a multiplying unit 22 by the output signal from the multiplying unit 18. The output signal from the multiplying unit 22 forms one input to a loss summing unit 24.SENSIBLE HEAT LOSS DUE TO MOISTUREIN THE COMBUSTION AIR AND FUEL 2 L2 1bus dry air lb fuel x y Ibs Moist. in lb of fuel x Specific Heat of H20 x T t Where L2 Sensible heat loss due to moisture in air and fuel Moisture in combustion air lbs lb of combustion air Conveniently, L2 can be determined by first determining the total moisture in the combustion air and fuel, then determining the heat loss per unit weight pound of moisture, the product of the two determinations being the sensible heat loss L2. The amount of moisture in the combustion air is often taken as y 0.013 weight units pounds per unit weight pound of dry air, corresponding to conditions of 27 0C 800F ambient temperature and 60 percent relative humidity or X can be calculated from measurements of ambient air temperature and relative humidity for varying weather conditions. When the moisture content y is assumed to be 0.013 weight units pounds per unit weight pound of dry air, a signal proportional thereto is generated in a signal generator 26 and transmitted through a selector switch 28 to a multiplying unit 30 for multiplication by the output signal from the multiplier unit 8 to produce a signal proportional to the weight units pounds of moisture in the weight units pounds of combustion air per unit weight pound of fuel. When moisture is calculated from measurements of ambient air temperature and relative humidity, a signal proportional to the vapour pressure of H2O at ambient temperature is first generated by means of a function generator 32 responsive to the signal generated in the ambient temperature transducer 14, which is multiplied in a multiplier unit 34 by a signal proportional to the relative humidity of the ambient air supplied for combustion, generated in a relative humidity transducer 36.The output signal from the multiplier unit 34 is then modified in accordance with changes in atmospheric pressure by means of a signal generator 38 generating a signal corresponding to ambient pressure which is subtracted from the output signal a from the multiplying unit 34 in a difference unit 40, producing an output signal b by which the output signal a is divided in a divider unit 42. The output signal from the divider unit 42 is then multiplied, in a multiplier unit 44, by a signal corresponding to the ratio between the molecular weight of water vapour and air, generated in a signal generator 46, to produce a signal proportional to the weight units pounds of water vapour per pound of air supplied for combustion.This signal may then be transmitted through the selector switch 28 to the multiplier unit 30 to produce the signal proportional to the weight units pounds of moisture in the weight units pounds of combustion air per unit weight pound of fuel. A signal proportional to the weight units pounds of moisture in a unit weight pound of fuel is generated in a signal generator 47 and transmitted to a summing unit 48 wherein it is added to the signal from the multiplying unit 30 to produce an output signal proportional to the total moisture in the combustion air and fuel per unit weight pound of fuel. This output signal is then multiplied in a multiplier unit 50 by a signal proportional to the heat in thermal units BTU wasted in the flue gases per unit weight pound of moisture to produce a signal proportional to the total loss per unit weight pound of fuel which is transmitted to the loss summing unit 24.The heat wasted in the flue gases per unit weight pound of moisture is obtained by multiplying the signal from difference unit 12 in a multiplier unit 52 by a signal proportional to the specific heat of water vapour, usually taken as 0.475 BTU per pound per degree Fahrenheit, generated in a signal generator 54. HEAT LOSS DUE TO VAPOURISATION OF WATER IN THE FUEL 3 L3 Ibs water in fueljlb of fuel x 1049Where L3 Heat loss due to vapourisation of water in the fuel 1049 latent heat of vapourisation in BTU 1b of waterThe signal proportional to the moisture in the fuel, generated in the signal generator 47, is multiplied, in a multiplier unit 58, by a signal proportional to the heat of vapourisation assumed to be 1049 BTU lb of water generated in a second generator 59. The output signal from the multiplier unit 58 is transmitted to a loss summing unit 60.HEAT LOSS DUE TO UNBURNED COMBUSTIBLES IN THE FLUE GAS 4 L4 combustibles in the flue gas x 1b dry products of combustion lb fuel x 9,746 Where L4 Loss due to Unburned Combustibles 9,746 Heat of Combustion in BTU lb of CO. While by good design and careful operation no unburned gaseous combustibles will be found in the flue gases, under certain conditions they may be unavoidable. The usual gaseous combustible is CO which, if present, materially reduces steam generator efficiency. The loss in thermal units BTU per unit weight pound of fuel is determined by means of the transducer 62 and the function generator 13 generating a signal proportional to the percent combustibles present in the flue gas which is multiplied, in a multiplier unit 64, by the output signal from the adder unit 25 to obtain a signal proportional to the weight units pounds of CO per unit weight pound of fuel. The output signal from the multiplier 64 is then multiplied, in a multiplier unit 66, by the output signal from a signal generator 68 proportional to the heat of combustion of CO, which is 9,746 BTU per pound of CO.The signal from a multiplier unit 66, proportional to the BTU loss per pound of fuel, forms one input signal to the loss summing unit 24.HEAT LOSS DUE TO UNBURNED CARBON IN THE ASH 5 EMI7.1 tb lbs SEP carbon 1b SEP ash tb L5 SEP SEP Ibs SEP ash lb SEP fuel SEP x SEP 1 SEP SEP 1bs SEP carbon 1b SEP ash SEP x SEP 14,500 tb Where L5 Loss in BTU lb of fuel due to carbon in the ash 14,500 heat of combustion, carbon to carbon dioxide This calculation requires an analysis of the ash to determine the weight units pounds fo carbon in the ash per unit weight pound of ash. The loss of BTU per pound of fuel is then determined by means of equation 5 .As shown in the drawing, a signal proportional to the loss is generated in a signal generator 70 which is transmitted to the loss summing unit 24.HEAT LOSS DUE TO HEAT RADIATION 6 L6 A Constant X Fractional Load 0 95 Where L 6 Radiation loss in percent of heat inputThe heat loss due to radiation varies inversely in non linear functional relationship to generator load as expression in equation 6 . As shown in the drawing, a signal proportional to the fractional boiler load is generated in a steam flow transducer 72 and a signal proportional to the non linear functional relationship between fractional load and radiation loss is generated in a function generator 74. UNACCOUNTED FOR LOSSES In addition to the loss due to heat radiation, there are certain other losses due, for example, to heat leaks and blow down. These losses are based on experiences reported in the literature and are expressed as percent losses and accordingly may be added to the signal output of the function generator 74 by means of a summing unit 76. A signal generated in a signal generator 78 is connected to an input of the summing unit 76 to produce an output signal proportional to the total of radiation and unaccounted for losses in percent which is transmitted to a summing unit 80. DETERMINATION OF VAPOUR GENERATOR EFFICIENCY The losses summed in the summing unit 60, expressed in thermal units BTU per unit weight pound of fuel, are converted to losses in percent by dividing the output signal from the summing unit 60, in a divider unit 81, by a signal proportional to the higher heating value of the fuel generated in a signal generator 82, to produce a signal proportional to the losses summed in the summing unit 60 expressed in percent. The output signal from the divider unit 81 is then summed in the summing unit 80 with the signal from the summing unit 76 to obtain an output signal proportional to the total percent losses, which is converted to a signal proportional to boiler efficiency by subtracting the output signal, in a difference unit 86, from a signal having a constant value of 100, generated in a signal generator 84. The output signal from the difference unit 86 is transmitted to such read out devices, schematically illustrated at 88, as are required to meet the exigencies of a particular application.
