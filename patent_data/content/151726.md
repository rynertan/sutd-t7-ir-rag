# A shield for decoupling RF and gradient coils in an NMR apparatus.

## Abstract
A shield for decoupling radio frequency RF and magne tic field gradient coils in an NMR apparatus is made up of first and second arrays of electrically conductive regions separated from one another by relatively narrow non conductive regions. The arrays are disposed on opposite surfaces of a member formed of a high dielectric material. The conductive regions of one array are offset relative to the conductive regions of the other array such that the conduc tive regions of the one array bridge the non conductive regions of the other array to form a plurality of capacitive elements. In operation, the capacitive elements acts essen tially as electrical short circuits at radio frequencies, but transmit substantially unaffected the homogeneous magne tic field and audio frequencies associated with pulsed magnetic field gradients.
