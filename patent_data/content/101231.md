# Motion detectors.

## Abstract
A constant range ultrasonic motion detector 10 has an ambient atmospheric condition sensor 38 which senses the temperature, pressure, and percent relative humidity of the ambient atmosphere and produces therefrom a range com pensation signal to adjust the sensitivity of the ultrasonic motion 10 for stabilizing the range. The range compensa tion signal is applied to adapt detector amplifier gain and or threshold level to the variation between design and ambient conditions. In one embodiment, an analog summing network at the ambient atmospheric sensor 38 outputs provides the range compensation signal and in a second embodiment a microprocessor is operative to provide the range compensa tion signal.
