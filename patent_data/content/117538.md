# POLYESTER POLYOLS AND A PROCESS FOR THEIR PRODUCTION

## Abstract
Described herein are polyester polyols having a mole cular weight of less than about 3000 and produced from the ring opening reaction of a lactone with a polyfunctional in tiator. These polyester polyols have increased reactivity with curing agents such as melamines, epoxides, and iso cyanates.
