# Adjustable automotive steering column with adjustable tilt and top position lock.

## Abstract
A pivotable steering column is adjustable to any of a number of angular positions defined by the teeth 106, 110 of two elements 104, 108 of a first locking device. A manual lever 102 can be raised to disable the first lock and allow selection of a different steering wheel inclination. The steering wheel 12 can be moved to its uppermost position by lowering the manual lever once. In this case, the first lock maintains engagement of the teeth 106, 110 of the aforementioned two element, and a powerful spring 144 pulls the steering column upward to the uppermost position irrespective of the first lock. A second lock 204, 210 then becomes wedged between the pivotable and stationary parts of the steering column, thus holding the former in the uppermost position. Lowering the manual lever 102 a second time disengages the second lock, allowing the steering column tilt down from the uppermost position. Thus, the steering column returns to an originally set driving position defined by locking engagement of the first lock.
