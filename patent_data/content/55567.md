## Claims

## Description
Improvements in and relating to the installation of packing materialsThis invention relates to a method of introducing packing material into a sealing gland on a shaft which may be rotable and or axially slidable relative to the gland. Such glands are found in pumps and valves for example and usually comprise an annular gland chamber surrounding the shaft, together with a gland nut or follower, which is itself a clearance fit on the shaft.The gland nut or follower is movable axially of the shaft to apply progressively greater pressure to a textile packing material wrapped around the shaft, inside the gland chamber.The textile packing material is usually. based on a textile fabric, often heavily impregnated with sealant lubricant materials such as graphite, grease and or fluorocarbon polymer. Braids are commonly used as textile packings for glands. When the gland starts to leak, the nut or follower is tightened down to stop the leak. Eventually, further tightening has little or no effect and the gland must be re packed by removing the gland nut or follower, so as to get access to the chamber. After clearing out the old packing, new packing is wrapped around the shaft and pushed axially of the shaft into the chamber to re fill it. The gland nut or follower is replaced and tightened sufficiently to effect a seal. Whilst the foregoing is a relatively simple procedure when the leaking fluid can be stopped at source for the duration of the re packing operation, serious problems may arise when stopping the fluid at source also requires a temporary cessation of production.In many instances, such a cessation is commercially unacceptable, except at planned maintenance periods.Problems also arise when the fluid is corrosive or potentially explosive, because unless stopped at source, large volumes of it will escape when the gland nut or follower is released, thereby creating a considerable hazard.The traditional solution to this sort of problem has been to immobilise the shaft by drilling into the gland chamber and injecting a self curing sealant composition which sets in situ. If successful, this stops the leak, but it also prevents any further rotation of the shaft, since the sealant must stick to the shaft to be really effective. Apart from immobilising the shaft, which is in itself not always acceptable, the eventual re packing operation when the plant can be safely shut down is not very easy, because the cured sealant has to be bored or broken out of the chamber.Another solution to the problem has been to inject a fibrous composition as a substitute replacement for t e original textile packing. However, such compositions lack the integrity needed to give a really satisfactory seal, whilst allowing normal movement or operation Qf the shaft. tAccording to the present invention, a method of re packing a gland chamber comprises the step of injecting a length of a textile packing material into the chamber through an aperture formed in Ã…a wall thereof. The textile packing may be a braided, woven or knitted textile braids have proved particularly satisfactory. The method may also include the step of forming, e.g. drilling, the aperture in the chamber, where no such aperture yet exists, but if the method has been used to treat the same gland on a previous occasion, the necessary aperture will already be present, albeit with a blanking plug or set screw in it to prevent leakage.Preferably, the aperture is aligned generally tangentially of a shaft passing through the gland, so that the injected material will tend to encircle the shaft. Preferably, the aperture is also slightly inclined with respect to a plane normal to the shaft, so that the injected material will tend to encircle around the shaft in a spiral. The method may therefore include the step of drilling the aperture so as to exhibit the two desired characteristics just mentioned.It has been found that a textile packing material and in particular, a braid, can be very satisfactorily injected through quite a small aperture say half of its as supplied diameter if it is first loaded into a tube in which it is relatively tightly confined. One end of the tube should be or should have an adaptor engageable with the hole through which injection is to be made. The other end should be provided with means for forcing the textile packing lengthwise from the tube through the hole. In practice a piston which is a sliding fit in the tube has proved suitable. Such a piston could perhaps be operated manually in some circumstances, but more typically, a fairly high pressure will be needed, For this, a modified grease gun tool has proved suitable.A conventional grease gun can be used as a source of hydraulic pressure for a piston in a barrel, the piston being connected to a rod which itself constitutes the piston for the tube containing the textile packing. It will be appreciated that drilling into the gland chamber may be hazardous, if the chamber contains fluid under pressure. Accordingly, it is particularly preferred that a blind aperture is drilled and then tapped, without breaking into the gland chamber. A adaptor including a valve is screwed into the blind aperture and the final drilling step is carried out through the adaptor. As soon as a clean aperture into the chamber has been made, the drill is withdrawn and the adaptor valve is shut to prevent further fluid blow off. The apparatus for injecting the textile packing can then be screwed into the adaptor and put under pressure before opening the adaptor valve.Injection of the textile packing follows as described earlier.Contrary to expectations, such severe treatment applied to a textile packing does not destroy its integrity.Even though injected through a relatively small aperture, the material is not torn apart. In fact, it tends to return to its original state.Obviously, in order to inject textile packing material into a gland chamber, the gland nut or follower must be partially released to create a space for the new packing material. However, the almost inevitable resultant leakage will normally be very much less than if the nut or follower were to be completely released or removed.Using the angled, tangential aperture described earlier, it is observed that a gland chamber can often be substantially completely re packed without actually removing the gland nut or follower. Successive lengths of textile packing will spiral around the shaft in the chamber and take up the position of a conventionally fitted packing. After injecting enough new textile packing material the gland nut or follower can be re tightened in the usual way. Because the method of the invention can be carried out live without completely dismantling the gland assembly and without interrupting the process involved, in many cases, at least , the method may be carried out as an adjunct to routine on line maintenance, instead of during periodic shut downs. This is especially useful, because it enables shut down maintenance to concentrate on major plant overhaul rather than on minor leakage problems.
