## Description
DIANEMYCIN DERIVATIVE MID PROCESS THEREFOR This invention relates to a novel polyether anti biotic, to a microbiological process for its production and a process for its recovery. More particularly, it relates to 19 epi dianemycin, its production by aerobically fermenting a new strain of Stretomyces hygroscopicus, its recovery from fermentation broth, and its use as an anticoccidial agent and antibacterial agent. Coccidiosis, a common and widespread infection in poultry, is caused by one or more of several species of protozoan parasites of the genus Eimeria. Two types of coccidiosis, cecal and intestinal, are known. The first type is caused by E. tenella and is characterized by severe hemorrhage. The second type is caused by various species of Eimeri a such as E. acervulina, E.necatrix, E. maxima E. hagani, E. mitis, E. praecox and E. brunetti. In turkeys, E. adenoides and E. maleaqrimitis are causative organisms of coccidiosis. The economic effects of coccidiosis are far reaching and elimination or control of the disease is, therefore, of great importance to the poultry industry. A wide variety of structural types of compounds have been described as anticoccidials including polyether antibiotics such as monensin J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 89, 5737 1967 nigericin Biochem. Biophys.

Microbiol., 22, 177 1977 , and by Shumard et.al., Antimicrob. Accents Chemother. 369 377 1967 . Swine dysentery, one of the most common swine diseases diagnosed in the United States, is also prevalent in many other countries and annually causes great economic loss. It has recently been discovered that a large spirochete, Treponema hyodvsenteriae, is, at the least, a primary source of the infection Earris, D. L. et al. Swine Dysentery l Inoculation of Pigs with Treponema hyodysenteriae New Species and Reproduction of theDisease, Vet. Med SAC, 67, 61 64 1372 J. Performance enhancement increased rate of growth and or increased efficiency of feed utilization in ruminants, such as cattle, is another economically desirable objective of veterinary science. Of particular interest is growth promotion achieved by increasing feoa utilization efficiency. The mechanism for utilization of The major nutritive portion carbohydrates of ruminant feds is well known. Microorganisms in the rumen of the animals degrade carbohydrates to monosaccharides which are then converted to pyruvates.Pyruvates are metabolized by microbiological processes to form acetates, butyrates or propionates, collectively known as volatile fatty, acids A . For a more detailed discussion, seeLeng in t Physiology of Digestion and Metabolism in theRuminant, Phillipson et al., Eds., Oriel Press,Newcastle upon Tyne, England, 1970, pp. 408 410. The relative efficiency of VFA utilization is discussed by McCullough in Feedstuffs, June 19, 1971, page 19 Eskeland et al. in J. An. Sci. 33, 282 a271 and Church et al. in Digestive Physiology and Nutrition of Ruminants, Vol. 2, 1971, pp. 622 and 625. Although acetates and butyrates are utilized, propionates are utilized wtth greater efficiency. Furthermore, when too little propionata is. available, animals may develop ketosis.A beneficial compound, therefore, stimulates animals to produced a higher proportion of propionates from carbohydrates, thereby increasing carbohydrate utilization efficiency and also reducing the incidence of ketosis. It has now been found that a new strain ofStreptomyces hvgroscopicus, isolated from a soil sample collected in Washington, D.C., elaborates a new and valuable antibiotic having anticoccidial properties.This new product was isolated and identified as 19 epi dianemycin. The antibiotic producing microorganism of this invention was isolated from a soil sample collected inWashington, D.C., U.S.A. It was designated as cultureN 483 29. Taxonomic studies of this microorganism were conducted by L. H. Huang who provided the following description. On the basis of his studies he concluded it is a strain of Streptomyces hygroscopicus Jensen Waksman and Henrici. The new culture possesses the narrow hyphae of the Actinomycetales, produces spore chains on the aerial mycelium and an unfragmented substrate myceliumThe results of whole cell analysis further establish that it belongs to the genus Streptomyces The culture N 483 29 is planted from a slant intoATCC 5172 broth and grown for three days at 280 C. on a shaker. It is then centrifuged for 20 minutes, washed three times with sterile distilled water and planted on media commonly used for identification of members of the Actinomycetales The culture is incubated at 280 C. The results, which may be read at varying times, are most commonly taken at 14 days.The colors are described in common terminology, but exact colors are determined by comparisons with color chips from the Color Harmony Manual, fourth edition. The methods of whole cell amino acid and sugar analyses are those described in Becker, B. et al., Accl. Microbiol., 12, 421 423, 1964 , and in Lechevalier, M. P., J. Lab. Clin.

Except for positive utilization of sucrose and raffinose, the isolate fis into the description of the neotype strain of S. hygroscopicus published in at. J Syst. Bact., 22, 265 394, 1972. The utilization of carbon sources differs among strains according to H. D. Tresner andE. J. Backus, who proposed a broadened concept of the species published in Applied Microbiology, 4, 243 250, 1956. The culture is thus considered as a strain ofStreptomyces hygroscopicus Jensen Waksman and Henrici.It has been deposited in the American Type CultureCollection, Rockville,.Maryland, a recognized depository affording permanence of the deposit and ready accessibility thereto by the public if a patent is granted on this application. This microorganism was given the designation Streptomyces hygroscopicus ATCC 39205 and was deposited on 6th October, 1982. It is to be understood that the present invention is not limited to use of the aforesaid organism which fully fits the above description, and which is given only for illustrative purposes. It is especially desired and intended to include the use of naturally occurring or artificially induced mutants and or variants, such as those which can be produced from the described organism, by various means, including x radiation, ultraviolet radiation, treatment with nitrogen mustards, and the like. We wish also to include any organism, regardless of its appearance or physiological behavior, that may be developed by means of transformation, transduction, genetic recombination or some other genetical procedure, using a nucleic acid or an equivalent material from the herein described species, whereby it has.acquired the ability to produce the elaboration product here described or to carry on the biochemical change here described. Cultivation of culture S. hvgroscopicus ATCC 39205 is conducted under submerged aerobic conditions at 21 to 370 C. with agitation in aqueous nutrient media.Typical nutrient media useful for cultivation include a source of assimilable carbon such as sugars, searches and glycerol a source of organic nitrogen such as casein, enzymatic digest of casein, casamino acids, soybean meal, cotton seed meal, peanut meal, wheat gluten, soy flour, yeast extract, meat meal and fish meal a source of growth substances such as grain soluble, fish meal, cotton seed meal and yeast extract as well as mineral salts such as sodium chloride and calcium carbonate and trace elements such as iron, magnesium, zinc, cobalt and manganese and calcium carbonate or phosphates as buffering agents. If excessive foaming is encountered during fermenta tion, antifoam agents such as vegetable oils or silicones are generally added to the fermentation medium. Aeration of the medium in tanks for submerged growth is preferably maintained at the rate of about 1 2 to 2 volumes of sterile free air per volume of fermentation broth per minute forced into the broth through a sparger. Agitation is matntarned b means of agitators generally familiar to those skilled in the fermentation art. The rate of agitation depends on the type of agitator employed. A shake flask is usually run at 150 to 200 cycles per minute whereas a fermentor is usually run at 300 to 1700 revolutions per minute. Aseptic conditions must, of course, be maintained through the transfer of the organism and throughout its growth. Inoculum is prepared by scraping vegetative cells from slants or Roux bottles inoculated with the N 483 29 culture. A solid medium suitable for initial growth on slants and Roux bottles is ATCC medium i172. ATCC 172 Grams literGlucose 10Soluble Starch 20Yeast Extract 5NZ Amine A 5Calcium Carbonate 1Distilled Water to 1000 ml pH to 7.0 with KOH Add Agar 20 Vegetative cells from slants are used to inoculate either shake flasks or inoculum tanks or alternately the inoculum tanks are inoculated from shake flasks. In shake flasks growth will generally have reached its maximum in 96 to 120 hours whereas in the inoculum tanks growth will usually be at the most favorable period in 72 to 96 hours. A fermenter is inoculated with vegetative brcth from the incculum flasks or tank under completely aseptic conditions and fermented for a period of 96 to 168 hours.Aeration is maintained in the shake flask by agitation of a shaker or in tanks by forcing sterile air through a sparger at the rate of 1 2 to 2 volumes of air per volume of broth per minute The speed of agitation stirring depends upon the type of agitator employed as noted above. The temperature is regulated between 24 C. and 36 C. Upon.completion of the fermentation, the antibiotic is recovered by extracting the whole broth with a water omnScible solvent such as n butanol, methylisobutyl ketone, ethyl acetate or chloroform at pE from 4.0 to 8.0.Alternatively, the mycelium is separated and extracted with one of the above enumerated solvents to isolate the antibiotic. The extract is concentra.ed, the concentrate taken up in heptane and chromatographed on silica gel. The progress of antibiotic production during fermentation and the bioactivity of the fe entation broth can be monitored by biological assay of the broth employing a sensitive strain of StahvIococcus aureus or Bacillus subtilis. S. aureus ATCC 6538 and B. subtilis ATCC 6633 are stable strains for this purpose.Standard plate assay technique is employed in which the zone of inhibi ion surrounding a filter paper disc saturated with the broth is used as a measure of antibiotic potency. Also, thin layer chromatography employing silica gel is a useful tool for analyzing the antibiotic produced in fe entation media and the composition of crude and purified materials extracted from the fermentation broths The Analtech silica gelGF chromatograms are developed with ethyl acetate methanol 9 1 or chloroforn methanol 9 1 .The antibiotic compound is visualized by spraying with vanillin reagent 3 g vanillin in 75 ml ethanol and 25 ml 85 phosphoric acid and heating the TLC plate at 80 C. The antibiotic appears as apurple spot.The plate can also be overlayed with agar seeded with either S. aureus or 3. subtilis to which 2,3,4 tri phenyl 2H tetrazolium chloride monohydrate has been added and incubated at 370 C. for 16 hours to visualize the antibiotic white against a pink background . Antibiotic 19 epi dianemycin exhibits inhibitory action against a variety of gram positive microorganisms. For this test each organism is inoculated in a series of test tubes containing nutrient medium and varying concentrations of 19 epi dianemycin to determine the minimal concentration of the antibiotic in mcg ml which inhibits the growth of the organism over a period at 24 hours MIC . 19 Epi dianemycin and its cationic salts exhibit excellent activity against coccidial infections in poultry. When incorporated into the diet of chickens at levels of 50 to 200 ppm, these compounds are efrec tive in controlling infections caused by Eimeria tenella,E. acervulina, E. maxima, E. brunetti and E. necatrix. Efficacy data for 19 epi dianemycin and its salts against coccidial infections in chickens was obtained in the following fashion Groups of 3 to 5 ten day oldSPF white leghorn cockerel chicks were fed a mash diet containing 19 epi dianemvcin or its sodium and or potassium salt uniformly dispersed therein. After being on this ration for 24 hours each chick was inoculated per os with oocysts of the particular species of Eimeria being tested. Other groups of 3 to 5 ten day chicks were fed a similar mash diet fre of 19 epidianemycin and were not infected with coccidia. These served as normal controls The results of treatment were evaluated after five days in the case of E.acervulina, and six days for all other chalienges. The criteria used to measure anticoccidial activity consisted of lesion scores of 0 to 4 for E. tenella after J. E. Lynch, A New Method for the Primary Evaluation of Anticoccidial Activity , Am. J. Vet. Res. 22, 324 326 1961 and 0 to 3 for the other species based on modification of the scoring system devised by J.Johnson and W. H. Reid, Anticoccidial Drugs. LesionScoring Techniques in Battery and Floor Pen Experiments in Chicks s, Exn. Parasit. 28, 30 36 1970 . A constant ratio was established by dividing the lesion score of each treated group by the lesion score of the infected control. The value of animal feeds generally has been determined directly by feeding the animal. BritishPatent Specification No. 1,197,826 details an in vitro rumen technique whereby the changes occurring in feeds brought about by microorganisms are measured more readily and with great accuracy in the evaluation of animal feeds.This technique involves the use of an apparatus in which the digestive processes of the animals are conducted and studied in vitro. The animal feeds, rumen inoculum and various growth promotants are introduced into and withdrawn from a laboratory unit under carefully controlled conditions and the changes taken place are studied critically and progressively during the consumption of the feed by the microorganisms. An increase in the propionic acid content in the rumen fluid indicates that a desirable response in overall ruminant performance has been brought about by the growth promotant in the feed composition The change in propicnic acid.content is expressed as percent of the propionic acid content found in the control rumen fluid.Long term in vivo feeding studies are used to show a reliable correlation between propionic acid increase in the rumen fluid and improved animal performance. Runen fluid is collected from a fistulated cow which is fed on a commercial fattening ration plus hay.The rumen fluid is Lmmediately filtered through cheese cloth, and 10 ml added to a 50 ml conical flask containing 400 mg of standard substrate 68 corn starch 17 cellulose 15 extracted soybean meal , 10 ml of a pH 6.8 buffer and the test compounds. The flasks are gassed with oxygen free nitrogen for about two minutes, and incubated in a shaking water bath at 390 C. for about 16 hours. All tests are conducted in triplicate. After incubation, 5 ml of the sample is mixed with 1 ml of 25 metaphosphoric acid After 10 minutes 0.25 ml of formic acid is added and the mixture centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 10 minutes. Samples are then analyzed.by gas liquid chromatography by the method of D. W.Kellog, J. Dairy Science 52, 1690 1969 . Peak heights for acetic, propionic and butyric acids are determined for samples from untreated and treated incubation flasks. In order to improve feed utilization by ruminants such as cattle and sheep and by monogastric animals such as pigs and rabbits, 19 epi disnemycin can be incorpo rated in feed compositions as the free acid, sodium salt, potassium salt or mixtures thereof. Crude forms of 19 epi dianemycin or dried fermentation broth containing the antibiotic can, of course, be incorporated in feed compositions at the desired potency concentrations. The following examples more fully Illustrate the present invention. They are, however, not to be con struted as limiting the scope of the invention. EXAMPLE 1 Shake flasks were prepared using the following medium CL13M Grams liter Cerelose 20.0 Soy Flour 10.0 Distiller Solubles 5.0 Sodium Sulfate 0.5 Cobalt Chloride 0.002 Calcium Carbonate 2. One hundred ml of medium was distributed into 300 ml shake flasks and sterilized at 1200 C and 15 psi for 30 minutes. After cooling, the medium was inoculated with a vegetative cell suspension from Streptomyces hygroscooicus ATCC 39205 grown on ATCC 172 agar medium.The flasks were shaken at 280 C. on a rotary shaker having a displacement of 1 1 2 to 2 1 2 inches and 150 to 200 cycles per minute CPM for three to four days.One flask was used to inoculate a five liter fermentation vessel containing three liters of the following media CL13M Grams liter Cerelose 20.0 Soy Flour 10.0 Distiller Solubles 5.0 Sodium Sulfate 0.5 Calcium Carbonate 2.0 Cobalt Chloride 0.002 Water to I liter pH 6.9 7.0 One milliliter of L61 silicone was added as an antifoaming agent, then the vessels were sealed and sterilized at 1200 C. and 15 psi for 45 minutes.The pots were inoculated with one tca. 3 inoculum flask, fermented for 96 to 168 hours at 3Qe C., stirred at 1700 revolutions per minute QRPMl with an air rate of one volume of air per volume of liquid per minute. When the fermantation was completed chased on an antibiotic dlse assay versus B. subtilis ATCC 66331 the. fermenters were stopped, filtered at the natural pE with the aid of dtatomaceous earth. The filtered cake was slurried in methanol, filtered, the solvent concen trated in vacuo, diluted with 2 3 volumes of water, then extracted 2x with 1 3 to 1 2 volume of a solvent such as methylisobutyl ketone. The solvent layer was separated from the aqueous phase by aspiration or centrifugation, sparkled and concentrated in vacuo to a viscous oil. Alternatively the antibiotic was isolated by extraction of the whole broth at natural pH with methylisobutyl ketone and concentration of the solvent to a viscous oil. The oil was suspended in heptane and batch treated with silica gel 60. The silica gel cake was eluted with chloroform, chloroform ethyl acetate and ethyl acetate. After concentration, the ethyl acetate fraction yielded a crude product from which 19 epidianemycin crystallized as the mixed sodium potassium salt. Thin layer chromatography of the crude product in the following systems, each of which separates a mixture of dianemycin and 19 epi dianemycin, detected only 19 epi dianemycin .

Approximately one liter 0.05 of inoculum was used in the tank. The fermenter, after fermenting 4 days, was harvested ca. 1100 gallons, 4164 liters . The whole broth was extracted with 1 5 volume or methylisobutyl ketone at natural pH, separated on a Podbielniack extractor and the solvent concentrated in vacuo to an oil 30.3 liters, 8 gallons . These oil was further concentrated on a cyclone evaporatcr to a syrup. After concentration, the oil was suspended in heptane, stirred with silica gel Merck silica gel 60 , then filtered through a bed of silica gel and washed repeatedly with heptane. The antibiotic was eluted stepwise with chloroform, chloroform ethyl acetate, ethyl acetate and finally 50 acetone in ethyl acetate. The elation was followed by thin layer chromatography and bioassay of the fractions. The active cuts were combined, concentrated and rechromatographed to isolate the antibiotic.During the workup, problems were encountered with the active cuts from the silica gel batch treatment. Passage of the active eluates down ,granular Darco carbon removed the interferring materials and improved the recovery. Ca. 40 grams of crystalline 19 epi dianemycin was recovered. EXAMPLE 3 An approximately ll0Q gallon C4164 liter fermenta tion of S. hyqroscopicus ATCC 3920.5 was prepared accord ing to Example 2. The whole broth was extracted with 1 5 volume of methylisobutyl ketone and the extract concentrated in vacuo to a brown oil Capproximately 1 gallon, 3.79 liters . The concentrate was poured into 3 gallons 11.4 liters of stirring heptane and the resultant slurry was filtered through a bed of diatomaceous earth. The filtrate was batch treated with 3 kg of Merck column grade silica gel 60 C70 230 mesh . The silica gel was washed with 3 gallons 11.4 liters each of heptane, chloroform, acetone and methanol. These fractions were examined by thin layer chromatography and the 19 epi dianemycin was found to be prImarily in the acetone and chloroform fractions. The acetone fraction 180 gl was chromatographed on an 8 x 100 cm column packed with Merck column grade silica gel 60 230 400 mesh in ethyl acetate. Ethyl acetate was used as the eluting solvent. The flow rate was 70 ml minute and fractions of approximately 1 liter each were taken. The cuts were examined by thin layer chromatography on Analtech GF silica gel plates developed in ethyl acetate. The plates were visualized by spraying with vanillin reagent C3 g vanillin in 75 ml ethanol and 25 ml 85 phosphoric acid and heating to 800 C. 19 Epi dianemycin appears as a purple spot under these conditions. The fractions containing 19 epi dianemycin were combined and evaporated. The concentrate was dissolved in 1 liter of chloroform, washed with 1 liter of acid water pH 41, then 1 liter of 5 dibasic sodium phosphate buffer pH 91, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and evaporated. The concentrate was taken up in acetone and a small amount Capproximately 10 of water added, whereupon 19 epi dianemycin crystallized as the sodium salt. The crystals were collected by filtration and dried in vacuo at rcom temperature.The yield was 23 g of sodium salt The chloroform fraction from the silica gel batch treatment C280 gm was redissolved in 1 liter of chloroform and passed down a 7 x 12Q cm column packed with granular activated charcoal in chloroform. It was eluted with chloroform at 20 ml minute and fractions of 300 ml collected. The antibiotic containing fractions were combined and concentrated. The concentrate was crystallized as the sodium salt form as described above for the acetone fraction. Vield was 14 grams. An additional 10 grams of crude material was obtained as a second crop. The sodium salt of 19 epi dianemycin melted at l93 205 C.
