# Air fuel ratio detector.

## Abstract
An A F ratio detector capable of accurately and unambi guously detecting the operating A F ratio of a burner such as an internal combustion engine whether the engine is operat ing in the fuel rich region, fuel lean region or at the theoretical A F ratio. The detector includes a solid electrolyte oxygen pump element 6 having a porous electrode 4,5 formed on both sides of an oxygen ion conductive solid electrolyte 3 , and a solid electrolyte oxygen concentration difference actuated electrochemical cell sensor element 12 disposed to face the pump element 6 with a small gap a therebetween and which has two pairs of porous electrodes 8, 9 10, 11 formed on opposite sides of an oxygen ion conductive solid electrolyte. An air compartment b open to the atmosphere is formed on a side of the electrochemical cell sensor element 12 opposite the small gap a . The electromotive force e generated by one pair of the porous electrodes on the electrochemical cell sensor element 12 , the pump current flowing through the other pair of porous electrodes on the sensor element 12 , or the pump current flowing thorugh the porous electrodes on the pump element provides an output signal for A F ratio direction.
