# HERMETICALLY SEALED CERAMIC CASED SURFACE MOUNT CAPACITOR

## Abstract
A planar terminated capacitor and a method for fabricat ing planar terminated capacitors is disclosed wherein a capacitor element 12 is inserted in a nonconductive ceramic case 14 . The case 14 extends outwardly beyond the ends of the capacitor element 12 forming cavities at each end of the case. Metal end caps 18a,b are positioned at the ends of the case substantially enclosing the cavities. The end caps are electrically coupled to the ends 24,26 of the capacitor element 12 .
