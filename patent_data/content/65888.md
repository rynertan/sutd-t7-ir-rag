# Backup arrangement for a fuel control apparatus for a gas turbine engine.

## Abstract
A backup arrangement for a fuel control apparatus 34 metering fuel flow Wf to a gas turbine engine in response to an electrical signal E indicative of a desired fuel air ratio for operation of the engine, said control apparatus comprising a metering valve 180 positioned by a hydraulic control pressure Pf for regulating the fuel flow therethrough, and means 192, 194, 195, 199 for modulating said hydraulic control pressure by means of either an electrical control 197, 198 or a manual control 38, 201 According to this invention, the modulating means is positioned either by said electrical control 197, 198 over a predetermined first range or by said manual control 38, 201 over a predetermined second range, and said first and second ranges are related to each other such that upon failure of the electrical control the modulating means automatically fails to a position within the second range For use in fuel control systems for gas turbine engines.
