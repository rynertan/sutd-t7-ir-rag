# Cyclic monomers from trifluoropyruvate esters.

## Abstract
Perhalogenated dioxolanes, and their preparation from fluorinated keto acids or esters and ethylene oxide, 2 chloroethanol or 2 bromoethanol are described. The perha logenated dioxolanes can be used to prepare unsaturated dioxolanes or dioxoles from which useful polymers can be prepared.
