# Fuel injection pump.

## Abstract
A sintered cam ring 1a is secured to the inner surface of a cylindrical body by means of a bolt 10 . A fuel injection pump has a rotor which supports a roller rotating along the inner surface of the sintered cam ring and is driven by an engine. The sintered cam ring is provided in the outer surface thereof with a groove 11 extending along the central axis thereof. A positioning member 13 for fixing the position of the groove 11 and that of a pin hole 12 formed in the body for receiving a bolt 10 is inserted such as to stretch between the groove 11 and the pin hole 12 . Further, a bolt 10 is employed to secure and tighten the positioning member 13 fitted in both the pin hole 12 and the groove 11 from the outside of the body.
