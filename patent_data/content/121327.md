# Impact resistant polymer with improved flow characteristics.

## Abstract
An olefin copolymer rubber graft composition having a viscoelastic performance index of not greater than 100 as defined by the expression PI DS MV i.v. where DS is the die swell of the composition, MV is the melt viscosity of the composition and i.v. is the intrinsic viscosity of a resinous portion extracted from the composition.
