## Description
This invention relates to an improvement in a process for producing aromatic polyesters. Wholly aromatic polyesters have been known, and, for example, homo and copolymers of p hydroxy benzoic acid have already been manufactured and marketed. These polymers have the defect that they have a low molecular weight, and because of their relatively high melting points or their lower decomposition temperatures than their melting points, they are difficult to process or fabricate. Furthermore, these polymers cannot be formed into practical fibers by a melt extrusion method. For example, fibers obtained by melt extrusion at very high temperatures generally have an empty internal structure and a low tensile strength. To overcome these defects, various new wholly aromatic polyesters have been proposed heretofore. They include, for example, polyesters derived from aromatic dicarboxylic acids and aromatic diols, and polyesters derived from aromatic dicarboxylic acids, aromatic hydroxycarboxylic acids and aromatic diols. These wholly aromatic polyesters have not proved to be entirely satisfactory, and have the disadvantage that they have a low molecular weight and tend to undergo decomposition rather than melting, and because of non uniformity in the polymerization reactions, polymers having fixed properties are difficult to obtain. From EP A 0 049 617 there was known a polyester of 6 hydroxy 2 naphthoic acid, p hydroxy benzoic acid terephthalic acid and resorcinol for melt processing to form shaped articles having increased impact strength. It is an object of this invention to provide a process for preparing wholly aromatic polyesters which at high temperatures have a high dimensional stability and do not tend to decompose in the molten state. That problem is solved according to the invention by a process for producing a melt processable wholly aromatic polyester which consists essentially of the recurring moieties I, II, III and IV wherein In the process according to the invention, the viscosity of the system decreases and the reaction proceeds smoothly, and as a result, the arrangement of the repeating units of the polymer becomes steady and the resulting polyester has improved properties. The raw material or raw material mixture capable of forming an aromatic polyester in this invention may be any one of the following materials a , b and c . The amount of 2 hydroxynaphthalene 6 carboxylic acid or its derivative used differs for the above materials a , b and c . For the materials a and b , it is not more than 10 mole , preferably 2 to 10 mole , especially preferably 5 to 10 mole , based on the total amount of the starting materials including 2 hydroxynaphthalene 6 carboxylic acid or its derivative . In the case of the material c , the amount is 2 to 15 mole , based on the total amount of the starting materials including 2 hydroxynaphthalene 6 carboxylic acid or its derivative . Amounts exceeding these limits are economically undesirable since 2 hydroxynaphthalene 6 carboxylic acid or its derivative is relatively expensive. In addition, they rather result in a reduction in the effect of carrying out the reaction smoothly. Such excessive amounts should therefore be avoided. Needless to say, in any of the above cases, the amounts of the individual starting materials should be selected such that the total amount of the alcohol component becomes equivalent to the total amount of the acid component. An example of the aromatic hydrocarboxylic acid other than 2 hydroxynaphthalene 6 carboxylic acid is p hydroxybenzoic acid. An examples of the aromatic dicarboxylic acid and its derivatives is terephthalic acid. Examples of the aromatic diol and its derivatives are 4,4 biphenol, hydroquinone, and naphthalene 2,6 diol. The polycondensation reaction of the starting materials is carried out by using a known ester interchange catalyst in an amount of about 0.001 to 1 by weight, preferably about 0.01 to about 0.2 by weight, based on the total weight of the starting materials. The ester interchange catalyst includes, for example, dialkyltin oxides, diaryltin oxides, titanium dioxide, titanium alkoxides, alkoxytitanium silicates, alkali metal or alkaline earth metal carboxylates, gaseous acid catalysts, Lewis acids such as BF The wholly aromatic polyester obtained by the method of this invention has an intrinsic viscosity, measured at 60 C for its solution in pentafluorophenol in a concentration of 0.01 by weight, of usually at least about 0.4, preferably at least about 1.0, for example 1.0 to 7.5, and a weight average molecular weight of about 2.000 to 200,000, preferably about 10,000 to about 50,000. The molecular weight of this wholly aromatic polyester can be increased by subjecting it to a solid state polymerization operation. For example, when the wholly aromatic polyester in the form of granules, fibers or a film is heated at a temperature below its melting point in an atmosphere of an inert gas such as nitrogen for several minutes to several days, if desired under reduced pressure, its molecular weight increases. Since the wholly aromatic polyester obtained by the process of this invention can form a thermotropic molten phase, it can be easily formed into various molded articles such as fibers, films and other three dimensional molded articles. Fibers are particularly advantageously used as tire cords, and also find applications as conveyor belts, hoses, cables and resin reinforcing materials. Films can be used as packaging tapes, cable wrappings, magnetic tapes, and electrically insulating films. Other three dimensional molded articles include, for example, machine parts, parts of electronic ovens, heating vessels.
