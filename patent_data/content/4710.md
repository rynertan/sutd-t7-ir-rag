## Description
PREPARATION OF AROMATIC FLUORO COMPOUNDS The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of 4,4 difluorobenzophenone. 4,4 difluorobenzophenone is a useful monomeric reactant for the production of aromatic polyketone polymers whose molecular chains comprise phenylene groups, oxygen atoms and ketone groups. For example, 4,4 difluorobenzophenone may be condensed with the di alkali metal salts of numerous aromatic bisphno1s to form different polyketones as described in BritishPatents 1 078 234 and 1 414 421. Alternatively 4,4 difluorobenzophenone may be condensed with aromatic bisphenols in the presence of alkali metal carbonates or bicarbonates to form polyketones, as in the process described in Canadian Patent 847 963. Known methods for the production of 4,4 difluorobenzophenone involve the use of Friedel Crafts acylations employing fluorobenzene as starting material.Such methods include reacting fluorobenzene with p fluoro benzoyl chloride or phosgene. However fluorobenzene is an expensive material and the reaction of fluorobenzene with phosgene produce an isomeric mixture which requires costly purification. Furthermore the handling and disposal of large amounts of spent catalysts as would be required on a production scale would also be costly. The present invention provides a cheaper, easily operable process for the production of 4,4 difluorobenzophenone without the production of unwanted isomers. We have found that 4,4 difluorobenzophenone may be prepared by diazotization of 4,4 diamino diphenylmethar.e in anhydrous or concentrated aqueous hydrogen fluoride, decomposition of the diazonium fluoride thus produced to yield 4,4 difluoro diphenylmethane and oxidation of 4,4 difluoro diphenylmethane to yield 4,4 difluorobenzophenone. The oxidation of 4,4 difluoro diphenylmethane may be carried out as a separate stage subsequently to the production thereof but we have found, surprisingly, that when the decomposition of the diazonium fluoride is carried out in the presence of nitrous acid or nitrite ions, oxidation of the methylene group to the carbonyl group of the desired product can be achieved directly, without the need for a subsequent oxidation stage. The reaction mechanism is not fully understood when the decomposition of the diazonium fluoride is carried out in the presence of nitrous acid or nitrite ions 4,4 difluoro diphenylmethane is not necessarily formed as an intermediate ie fluorination does not necessarily precede oxidation of the methylene group . Thus according to the present invention there is provided a process for the preparation of 4,4 difluorobenzophenone which comprises the following steps 1 diazotization of 4 ,4 diamino diphenylmethane in anhydrous or concentrated aqueous hydrogen fluoride to yield a solution of a corresponding diazonium fluoride and 2A i thermally decomposing the diazonium fluoride in the solution thus produced to yield 4,4 difluoro diphenylmethane and ii subsequently oxidising the 4,4 difluoro diphenylmethane to yield 4,4 difluorobenzophenone, or 2B thermally decomposing the diazonium fluoride in the solution produced in Step 1, in the presence of nitrous acid or nitrite ions as oxidising agent, to yield 4,4 difluorobenzo phenone. The nature of the ionic species present in anhydrous or concentrated aqueous hydrogen fluoride is not fully understood and the terms nitrous acid and nitrite , as used herein, include species derived from nitrous acid or nitrite ions in the reaction medium, for exampleHF complexes of N203. The process is most conveniently carried out by introducing nitrite ions in the form of an alkali metal nitrite, preferably sodium nitrite. The nitrite is preferably introduced in the form of a solution in anhydrous or concentrated aqueous hydrogen fluoride. In general, the yield of the desired product decreases as the proportion of water in the reaction mixture increases. If desired, anhydrous hydrogen fluoride may be used as the initial medium and as the solvent for the nitrous acid or nitrite introduced. It will be appreciated, however, that water is produced in the overall process leading from 4,4 diaminodiphenylmethane to 4,4 difluoro benzophenone.Accordingly, there is no point in rigorous exlusion of water from the reaction medium but if aqueous hydrogen fluoride is employed as the initial medium this preferably contains at least 60 , preferably at least 70 , by weight of HF. The proportion of water initially present is preferably chosen so that at the end of the process the proportion of. water including that produced in the process is less than 50 by weight of the total of HF and water preferably the final proportion of water is less than 40 , particularly less than 30 , on this basis. From stoichiometric considerations, there should be at least 4 moles of HF present per mole of 4,4 diaminodiphenylmethane. However since HF is also employed as solvent it is usually present in a large excess over stoichiometric, e.g. in a 5 30 fold excess over the stoichiometrically necessary quantity. A large amount of HF will also minimise by dilution the effect of the water produced in the diazotization reaction. In the process including Step 2A i , in which the diazonium fluoride is decomposed to yield 4,4 difluorodiphenylmethane, this decomposition is preferably carried out at a temperature of at least 400C since below this temperature the transformation of the diazonium fluoride may be unacceptably slow. It is especially preferred that the temperature at this stage should be at least 5O0C, for example in the range 500C to 1000C especially from 500C to 700C .The diazotization Step 1 and the thermal decomposition Step 2A i are preferably combined into a single stage by adding the nitrous acid or nitrite ions continuously or incrementally over at least part of the total reaction period to a solution of 4,4 diamino diphenylmethane in anhydrous or concentrated hydrogen fluoride maintained at a temperature of at least 400C, the preferred temperature ranges being as already specified in respect of Step 2A i . Consequently, as the diazotization reagent is added to the hot solution of 4,4 diamino diphenylmethane, there is a continuous or incremental conversion of aromatic amine to 4,4 difluoro diphenylmethane so that at no time is there an appreciable amount of the diazonium fluoride present in the reaction medium and therefore minimal risk of detonation or an uncontrollable reaction .Alternatively, diazotization may be effected at a relatively low temperature for example from 5 C to 50C and the diazonium fluoride solution then warmed up to the temperature required to effect the desired decomposition and fluorination. In the process including Step 2A i , when the reaction has been carried as far as the production of 4,4 difluoro diphenylmethane, this compound may be separated and purified using conventional work up techniques employing, for example, extraction with solvent, washing and distillation before being oxidised Step 2A ii to yield 4,4 difluorobenzophenone.Alternatively, the 4,4 difluoro diphenylamine may be oxidised without preliminary purification, any purification being delayed until completion of the oxidation. A wide range of oxidising agents may be used to effect the oxidation of 4,4 difluorodiphenylmethane to 4,4 difluorobenzophenone Step 2A ii . Examples of suitable oxidising agents include nitric acid optionally with acetic acid and air with cobalt or manganous bromides in acetic acid oxidation using these reagents may conveniently be carried out under reflux conditions. In the diazotization Step 1 , at least the stoichiometric proportion of diazotizing agent should be used, i.e. at least 2 moles of nitrous acid or nitrite ions per mole of 4,4 diamino diphenylmethane. When the diazotization Step 1 is to be followed by Step 2A i the diazotization is preferably carried out using substantially stoichiometric proportions, for example up to a 5 excess of nitrous acid or nitrite over the exact stoichiometric proportion. When Step 1 is to be followed by Step 2B i.e. when nitrous acid or nitrite is employed as the oxidising agent the overall process may be carried out in a variety of ways. If desired, the diazotization Step 1 and the decomDosition oxidation Step 2B may be combined into a single stage by carrying out the diazotization at a temperature of at least 400C, using an excess of nitrous acid or nitrite over and above the proportion required for the diazotization itself.The proportion of nitrous acid or nitrite employed is preferably at least 3 moles per mole of 4,4 diaminodiphenylmethane, for example from 4 to 6 moles of nitrous acid or nitrite per mole of 4,4 diaminodiphenylmethane. A greater excess may be used if desired but in general no benefit is secured by increasing the proportion of nitrous acid or nitrite beyond this range. Thus Step 1 and Step 2B may be combined by adding the nitrous acid or nitrite continuously or incrementally to a solution of 4,4 diamino diphenylmethane in anhydrous or concentrated aqueous hydrogen fluoride maintained at a temperature of at least 400C, the total proportion of nitrous acid and or nitrite introduced being at least 3 moles per mole of 4,4 diamino diphenylmethane the temperature of the react ion mixture may then be maintained at 40 C or above for such further period as may be necessary to effect conversion to 4,4 difluoro benzophenone.In this embodiment of the invention the temperature of the reaction mixture is preferably maintained at 500C or above for example from SO0C to 1000C, especially from 50 C to 700C both during the addition of the nitrous acid or nitrite and during any further period of heating. Alternatively, Step 1 may be followed by Step 2B as a separate stage. Thus the process of diazotization may be carried out at a relatively low temperature, for example at a temperature of 50C or below, the reaction mixture subsequently being heated to a temperature of at least 400C in the presence of excess nitrous acid or nitrite ions.In this embodiment, the proportion of nitrous acid or nitrite introduced at the relatively low temperature may simply be the stoichiometric proportion required for diazotization 2 moles of nitrous acid or nitrite per mole of 4,4 diamino diphenylmethane or a slight excess over this proportion for example a 5 excess the balance of the nitrous acid or nitrite required to provide the total of at least 3 moles per mole may then be introduced when the temperature of the reaction mixture has subsequently been raised to 400C or above. If desired, however, all or part of this balance of nitrous acid or nitrite required may be introduced at the relatively low temperature.In this embodiment also, the temperature of the reaction mixture is preferably maintained at 50 C or above during the heating stage and the total proportion of nitrous acid and or nitrite introduced is at least 4 moles per mole of 4,4 diamino diphenylmethane for example from 4 to 6 moles per mole . The time required at the heating stage Step 2A i or Step 2B will depend upon such factors as the concentration of hydrogen fluoride, the excess of nitrous acid or nitrite and the temperature employed.In general the temperature of the reaction mixture will be maintained at 40 C or above for a period ranging from about half an hour to several hours after addition of the nitrous acid or nitrite has been completed. The heating stage Step 2A i or 2B is conveniently carried out under reflux conditions. The proportion of water at this stage may be increased, if necessary, to allow the required temperature to be maintained under reflux conditions alternatively, superatmospheric pressure may be used. After completion of the reaction, 4,4 difluorobenzophenone may be separated from the reaction mixture by conventional methods, for example solvent extraction. The invention is illustrated by the followingExamples.EXAMPLE 1 This is an example in which Step 1 is followed byStep 2B. A solution of 4,4 diamino d,phenylmethane 79.2g, 0.4 mole in aqueous 85 w w hydrogen fluoride 300g was prepared in a reactor equipped witch a stirrer and condenser. A solution of sodium nitrite 112.6g, 1.63 mole in aqueous 85 w w hydrogen fluoride . 700g was prepared at 50C. The cold nitrite solution was continuously added dropwise over 15 minutes to the solution of 4,4 diamino diphenylamine which was initially at 160C.The reaction mixture was cooled so that the temperature did not rise above 20C during addition of the nitrite solution. After addition of the nitrite solution had been completed, the mixture was heated to reflux temperature 550C to 6O0C , maintained under reflux for 21 4 hours and then allowed to cool to room temperature. The reaction mixture was subjected to solvent extraction with diethyl ether, the extract washed with water and the ether removed. The product was recrystallised from an 80 20 weight weight mixture of industrial methylated spirits and water to yield 35.7g 41 of 4,4 difluorobenzophenone, melting point 1080cm The structure of the product was confirmed by infra red and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.EXAMPLE 2 This is an example in which Step 1 is combined withStep 2A i and followed by Step 2A ii . A solution of 4,4 diaminodiphenylmethane 39.6g , 0.2M in aqueous 80 HF 80 ml was prepared in a polyethylene bottle equipped with a stirrer and condenser.A solution of NaN02 28.15g, 0.408M in aqueous 80 HF 120 ml was prepared at 50C. The cold nitrite solution was continuously added dropwise over 30 minutes to the amine solution held at reflux the temperature of the refluxing medium being 700C at the start of the addition and 6O0C at the end of the addition . The total amount of water pesent after all of the amine had been diazotized was thus 25 by weight taking into account the water derived from the aqueous HF and the water produced in the diazotization reaction . After the addition of NaN02, the reaction medium was held at reflux for a further 1.5 hours and then allowed to cool. This was extracted into diethyl ether, washed with water thrice and vacuum distilled boiling point 900C at lmm . The distilled 4,4 difluorodiphenylmethane was a colourless liquid which crystallised on cooling. The yield was 28.4g or 69.68. The procedure was repeated usinq 85 HF and qave a yield of 68.2 . The 4,4 difluorodiphenylmethane 40g was refluxed with 35 w w nitric acid 300 ml for 18 hours the mixture being stirred . The crude oxidation product was collected, washed repeatedly with water and then dissolved without prior drying in industrial methylated spirits 160 ml and water 40 ml at reflux. After cooling, the product, in the form of colourless plates was collected and washed with a little 1 1 industrial methylated spirits water before drying under vacuum at 700C. The yield of 4,4 difluorobenzophenone was 38.18g or 89.3 its melting point was 106 1070C.EXAMPLE 3 The general procedure was similar to that described in Example 1. A solution of sodium nitrite 155g, 2.24 mole in aqueous 95 w w hydroqen fluoride 575 ml was prepared at 100C. A portion of this solution 210 ml, 0.815 mole of nitrite was added rapidly, with stirring, to a solution of 4,4 diamino diphenylmethane 79.2 g, 0.40 mole in aqueous 95 w w hydrogen fluoride 150 ml , the temperature being maintained between 200C and 100 C. This addition effected diazotization the rest of the nitrite solution was added over a period of 2 hours while the temperature was maintained at 100C or below.The mixture was then heated to reflux 550C to 570C over a period of 45 minutes and maintained under reflux for 3 hours. After coolinq to room temperature, the reaction mixture was extracted with three 200 ml portions of carbon tetrachloride. The combined extracts were washed with water and the solvent was removed by distillation.The product was recrystallized from an 80 20 w w mixture of industrial methylated spirits water to yield 68.5 g 78 of 4,4 difluorobenzophenone melting point 1080C . EXAMPLE 4 The general procedure was similar to that described inExample 1. Solid sodium nitrite 127 g, 1.84 mole was added slowly, with stirring, to a solution of 4,4 diaminodiphenylmethane 79.2 q, 0.40 mole in aqueous 90 w w hydroqen fluoride 590 g , the temperature being maintained between 200C and IOOC. The mixture was then heated to reflux 620C to 640C over a period of 1.5 hours and maintained under reflux for 1 hour. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was extracted with three 200 ml portions of carbon tetrachloride. The product was extracted and recrystallized as described in Example 3 to yield 53.5 g 61 of 4,4 difluorobenzophenone melting point 1090C .
