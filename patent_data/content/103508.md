# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR OBTAINING A DISPLAY OF A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE PERIPHERY OF A WELL

## Abstract
The apparatus and method of the present invention pertain to visual presentation systems employing scan lines, wherein each scan line is divisible into sets of points respectively corresponding to locations at which well measurements are mode. The resulting sets are shaded in accordance with the value of the respective measurements. Harsh transitions between adjacent sets are removed by having a parameter evaluated for each point of the scan line in accordance with a the spatial relationship of a subset of points which includes the point to adjacent sets of points and b the well measurement made at the location to which the point corresponds. The parameter value is compared with a randomly or pseudo randomly generated number, and the point is marked if the result of the comparison satisfies a preselected relationship. The parameter is evaluated and the comparison is made for all other points in the scan line.
