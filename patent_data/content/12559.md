# Polyvinyl chloride ethylene oxide polymer blends and methods of modifying the impact and melt flow properties of polyvinyl chloride.

## Abstract
In the modification of the properties of polyvinyl chloride PVC , such as impact resistance and melt flow, polymers de rived from monomer systems comprising at least 80 by weight ethylene oxide and free of pendant epoxy groups along the polymer chain are blended with PVC. The modifying ethylene oxide polymer may be crosslinked with a symmetri cal diepoxide.
