# Method and apparatus for sewing slide fasteners to pairs of fabric pieces.

## Abstract
A slide fastener 1 is sewn to a pair of fabric pieces 2, 2 in a sewing station 5 defined by a double needle sewing machine 4 with a pair of fastener stringers 32, 33 is twist ed around in mirror symmetry with respect to the longitudi nal centerline of the slide fastener. A slider 8 , which is slidable on and along the fastener stringers, is temporarily held by a slider holder 9 disposed downstream of and ad jacent to the sewing station 5 . As the sewing operation progresses and until after the engagement of the slider 8 with the bottom end portion of the slide fastener 1 , the pair of fastener stringers 32, 33 are automatically progressive ly uncoupled. The further movement of the slide fastener 1 causes the slider 8 to be forced by the bottom end portion of the slide fastener 1 past the slider holder 9 .
