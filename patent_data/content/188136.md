# Sonorous toy.

## Abstract
The present invention consists of a sonorous toy consisting of two symmetric bars 1,2 which are articulated with respect to each other in the manner of scissors and which are constantly forced away from each other by means of a spring 8 , one side 4,5 of the bars being in the form of handles to drive or activate the toy while the opposite side 6,7 is in the form of hands, both hands facing each other in an applause position.

## Claims
Claims 1. A sonorous toy, characterized by the fact that it has a pincer shape, made up of two symmetrical levers 1,2 joined together by means of an intermediate transverse axis of rotation 3 , from whose axis both levers are formed, towards one end, in the form of handles 4,5 , while towards the opposite end both have wider convex curved ends 6,7 , in the shape of extended hands facing each other and joinable by the observe side or palm, the assembly bearing a spring 8 mounted between the sections that define the handles, which constantly forces the levers towards their open position. 2. A toy in accordance with claim 1, characterized by the fact that said spring is made up of a V shaped bent steel sheet, mounted between the handles, with the vertex facing the joint axis and with the ends fastened to said handles.

## Description
Sonorous toy.The present invention relates to a sonorous toy, with a simple structure and which is easy to use, thought up to achieve a sound that reproduces or simulates a clap.The toy of the invention has a pincer type structure, made up of two levers that are jointed together by means of an intermediate transverse axis of rotation. The two levers are formed from this axis, towards one end, in the form of handles, while towards the opposite end both levers have wider convex curved ends, in the shape of extended hands facing each other and joinable by the observe side or palm.The described unit has a spring that constantly forces the levers towards their open position mounted between the sections that define the handle.The two levers may be made from a light plastics material which is resistent to deformation and to impact.A more detailed description of the structure and functioning of the toy of the invention is now going to be made, with reference to the appended drawings, where a possible form of construction is shown, as a non restrictive example.In the drawings Figure 1 is a side view of the toy.Figure 2 is a plan view of the same toy.As it can be observed in the drawings the toy is made up of two levers referenced by numbers 1 and 2, which are jointed together by means of an intermediate transverse axis 3. On both sides of this axis the two levers are divided into sections of a different length. The shortest sections, referenced by numbers 4 and 5,are in the form of handles, in such a way that they can be grasped and operated with one hand. The longest sections, referenced by numbers 6 and 7, both have wider convex curved ends, in the shape of extended hands facing each other and joinable by the observe side or palm.Between sections 4 and 5 that make up the handles there ls a spring 8 formed by V shaped bent steel sheet, with the vertex facing the joint axis 3 and with its ends fastened to the handles 4 and 5 by means of screws or rivets 9.The wider ends 6 and 7 have facing flat surfaces that coincide when the pincer shaped unit closes.With the described structure, spring 8 tends to keep the levers 1 and 2 constantly open, in the position shown in figure 1. By exerting pressure on the handles 4 and 5 the pincer is closed in such a way that sections 6 and 7 hit each other, producing a sound that simulates a clap by percussion. As soon as one stops pressing the handles 4 and 5, the unit recovers its initial open position. As can be seen in figure 1, the levers 1 and 2 have a slight bend or intermediate curvature to define the area of articulation. Besides, as can be seen in figure 2, the two levers may have complementary side recesses 10 that define a fitting area that the joint axis 3 passes through.The levers 1 and 2 are made out of a light resistant plastic material, so that a long lasting, appealing easy to use toy is achieved.The handles 4 and 5 are shaped and sized in such a way that the toy can be handled and operated with one hand.Having sufficiently described the nature of the invention, as well as the way to make it in practice, it must be stated that the features indicated above are susceptible to changes of detail as long as they do not alter its basic principle.
