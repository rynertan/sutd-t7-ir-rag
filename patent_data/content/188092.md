# Reaction system for a heat engine.

## Abstract
A fuel composition for a reaction chamber which when combined with a selected reactant produces heat energy and hydrogen gas. A reaction chamber structure, method of making and method of operating the reaction chamber are also disclosed. A reaction system for a Rankine cycle steam engine in which water is reacted with a two part fuel to produce heat and hydrogen. The starting part 38 of the fuel comprises lithium hydride, aluminum and magnesium and is the first to be contacted by the water. The heat of reaction liberated melts the main part 40 of the fuel, which comprises magnesium and aluminium which then also reacts with the water. The water is introduced through an inlet 14 , the drogen leaves via an outlet 16 and the heat is removed by a heat exchanger 20 .
