## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTIONISOQUINOLINE CARBOXYLIC ACID DERIVATIVES, PROCESS FORPREPARING AND PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION CONTAINING THE SAMEBACKGROUND OF INVENTION This invention relates to isoquinoline carboxylic acid derivatives and related compounds which are useful as converting enzyme inhibitors and as antihypertensives.The compounds of this invention are represented by the following formula EMI1.1 whereinR and R4 are independently hydrogen, loweralkyl, aralkyl R1 is alkyl of from 1 to 10 carbon atoms which include branched, cyclic and unsaturated alkyl groups substituted alkyl of from 1 to six carbon atoms and the substituent is amino, arylthio, aryloxy, hydroxy, arylamino and acylamino aralkyl and heteroaralkyl optionally substituted in the aryl and heteroaryl groups by halo, loweralkyl, hydroxy, alkoxy, amino, and aminoalkyl groups and optionally substituted in the C1 C6 alkyl groups by amino, acylamino or hydroxy groups R2 is hydrogen, alkyl of from 1 to six carbon atoms optionally substituted by amino, alkylamino, arylamino, acylamino, heteroaryl, or aryl groups R3 is hydrogen, halo, or alkoxy and, the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. The loweralkyl groups, except where noted otherwise, represented by any of the variables include straight and branched chain hydrocarbon radicals of from one to six carbon atoms such as, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, t butyl, pentyl, isopentyl, hexyl or vinyl, allyl, butenyl, and the like. The aralkyl groups represented by any of the above variables have from one to four carbon atoms in the alkyl portion thereof and include, for example, benzyl, phenethyl, and the like. Halo means chloro, bromo, iodo or fluoro.Aryl where it appears in any of the radicals, except where noted, represents ph enyl, or naphthyl and heteroaryl includes, for example, indolyl, thienyl, quinolinyl, isoquinolinyl, imidazolyl, furyl, pyridyl and benzothienyl. Heteroaralkyl indicates that these same residues are attached to 1 4 carbon atoms and include, for example, indolylethyl, l iso quinolinylmethyl, and the like. Acylamino refers to loweralkanoylamino and aroylamino groups. Preferred are those compounds of Formula I wherein R and R4 are independently hydrogen, loweralkyl, and aralkyl R1 is alkyl of from 1 to 6 carbon atoms optionally substituted by amino, hydroxyl, acylamino, aryloxy, arylthio, aralkyl and heteroaralkyl wherein the aryl and heteroaryl groups may optionally be substituted by halo, loweralkyl, hydroxy, alkoxy, amino and aminoalkyl groups R2 is alkyl of from 1 to 6 carbon atoms optionally substituted by amino, heteroaryl, or aminoloweralkylthio groups and,R3 is hydrogen. Still more preferred are those compounds ofFormula I wherein R is hydrogen, loweralkyl andR1, R2 and R3 are as defined in the preferred compounds above. Most preferred are compounds of Formula I wherein R and R4 are independently hydrogen or loweralkyl R1 is aralkyl or heteroaralkyl optionally substituted by halo or aminoalkyl groups R2 is alkyl of from 1 to 6 carbon atoms optionally substituted by amino or aminoloweralkythio groups and,R3 is hydrogen. The preferred, more preferred and most preferred compounds also include the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. The compounds of this invention can be synthesized by the methods described hereinbelow.Unless otherwise indicated, starting materials required for these syntheses are known in the literature or can be made by known methods using known starting materials. Interfering functionality in the starting materials such as, for example, hydroxy, carboxy or amino groups, can be masked by protecting groups which can then be subsequently removed to afford desired end products. Appropriate protecting groups are well known to those skilled in the art of peptide chemistry, some of which are illustrated in the processes described herein. In the following description of the invention processes, R, R1, R2, R3 and R4 are as defined above, unless otherwise indicated. REACTION SCHEMEEMI5.1 With reference to the foregoing ReactionScheme, dipeptide analog II is synthesized by coupling an a blocked amino acid for example,Z carbobenzyloxy or t butoxycarbonyl with an isoquinoline ester using appropriate reagents such as, for example, dicyclohexyl carbodiimide or diphenylphosphoryl azide. The Z protecting group is removed using standard methods and R can then be taken off of the isoquinoline carboxylate by saponification. The a keto acids or esters containing the R1 substituent are then reductively added to compound II.This can be conveniently accomplished using sodium cyanoborohydride in a mixed aqueous solvent at approximately neutral pH or by hydrogenation in an inert solvent in the presence ofPd C or Raney nickel. Removal of protecting groups, if present, affords the desired products of Formula I. The carbon atoms to which R1 and R2 are attached and the asymmetric.carbon in the isoquinoline ring of Formula I compounds are all preferably of the S absolute configuration. Other diastereomers in which an R configuration is present also exhibit activity and are, therefore, also included within the scope of this invention.Preferred Formula I diastereomers are isolated either by chromatography or fractional crystallization. The a ketocarboxylate derivatives used in the reductive alkylation can include such compounds as, for example, ethyl 2 oxo 4 phenylbutyrate, ethyl 4 chlorophenyl 2 oxobutyrate, ethyl 4 4imidazolyl 2 oxobutyrate, ethyl 2 oxo 4 2thienyl butyrate, ethyl 2 oxo 4 2 napthyl butyrate, ethyl 4 hydroxy phenyl 2 oxobutyrate, ethyl phenoxypyruvate, ethyl 2 oxo 5 phenylpentanoate, ethyl 4 p methoxyphenyl 2 oxobutyrate, ethyl 5 methyl 2 oxohexanoate, benzyl 2 oxo 6phthalimidohexanoate, and the like, and their respective free acids. The compounds of this invention form salts with various inorganic and organic acids and bases which are also within the scope of the invention.Such salts include ammonium salts, alkali metal salts like sodium and potassium salts, alkaline earth metal salts like the calcium and magnesium salts, salts with organic bases e.g., dicyclohexylamine salts,N methyl D glucamine, salts with amino acids like arginine, lysine, and the like. Also, salts with organic and inorganic acids may be prepared, e.g., HC1, HBr, H2SO4, H3PO4, methanesulfonic, toluenesulfonic, maleic, fumaric, camphorsulfonic. The non toxic physiologically acceptable salts are preferred, although other salts are also useful, e.g., in isolating or purifying the product. The salts may be formed by conventional means as by reacting the free acid or free base forms of the product with one or more equivalents of the appropriate base or acid in a solvent or medium in which the salt is insoluble, or in a solvent such as water which is then removed in vacuo or by freeze drying or by exchanging the cations of an existing salt for another cation on a suitable ion exchange resin. The compounds of this invention inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme and thus block conversion of the decapeptide angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II is a potent pressor substance. Thus blood pressure lowering can result from inhibition of its biosynthesis especially in animals and humans whose hypertension is angiotensinII related. Furthermore, converting enzyme degrades the vasodepressor substance, bradykinin. Therefore, inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme may lower blood pressure also by potentiation of bradykinin.Although the relative importance of these and other possible mechanisms remains to be established, inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme are effective antihypertensive agents in a variety of animal models and are useful clinically, for example, in many human patients with renovascular, malignant and essential hypertension. See, for example, D. W.Cushman et al., Biochemistry 16, 5484 1977 . The evaluation of converting enzyme inhibitors is guided by in vitro enzyme inhibition assays. For example, a useful method is that of Y. Piquilloud, A. Reinharz and M. Roth, Biochem.Biophys. Acta, 206, 136 1970 in which the hydrolysis of carbobenzyloxyphenylalanylhistidinylleucine is measured. In vivo evaluations may be made, for example, in normotensive rats challenged with angiotensin I by the technique of J. R. Weeks and J. A. Jones, Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med., 104, 646 1960 or in a high renin rat model such as that ofS. Koletsky et al., Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 125, 96 1967 . Thus, the compounds of this invention are useful as antihypertensives in treating hypertensive mammals, including humans, and they can be utilized to achieve the reduction of blood pressure by formulating in compositions such as tablets, capsules or elixirs for oral administration or in sterile solutions or suspensions for parenteral administration. The compounds of this invention can be administered to patients in need of such treatment in a dosage range of 1.0 to 200 mg per patient generally given several times, thus giving a total daily dose of from 1.0 to 800 mg per day. The dose will vary depending on severity of disease, weiqht of patient and other factors which a person skilled in the art will recognize. Also, the compounds of this invention may be given in combination with diuretics or other antihypertensives. Typically, these are combinations whose individual per day dosages range from one fifth of the minimally recommended clinical dosages to the maximum recommended levels for the entities when they are given singly.To illustrate these combinations, one of the antihypertensives of this invention, effective clinically in the range 15 200 milligrams per day, can be effectively combined at levels ranging from 3 200 milligrams per day with the following antihypertensives and diuretics in dose ranges per day as indicated hydrochlorothiazide 15 200 mg , timolol 5 60 mg , methyldopa 65 2000 mg , the pivalyloxyethyl ester of methyldopa 30 1000 mg , indacrinone and variable ratios of its enantiomers 25 125 mg , and 2 1 hydroxycyclohexyl ethyl 4 oxo 2 thiazolidinya propyl3 benzoic acid 10 100 mg . In addition, the triple drug combinations of hydrochlorothiazide 10 100 mg plus amiloride 5 20 mg plus converting enzyme inhibitor of this invention 3 200 mg or hydrochlorothiazide 10 100 mg plus timolol 5 60 mg plus the converting enzyme inhibitor of this invention 3 200 mg are effective combinations to control blood pressure in hypertensive patients. The above dose ranges will be adjusted on a unit basis as necessary to permit divided daily dosage. Also, the dose will vary depending on the severity of the disease, weight of patient and other factors which a person skilled in the art will recognize. Typically the combinations shown above are formulated into pharmaceutical compositions as discussed below. About 1.0 to 100 mg of a compound or mixture of compounds of Formula I or a physiologically acceptable salt is compounded with a physiologically acceptable vehicle, carrier, excipient, binder, preservative, stabilizer, flavor, etc., in a unit dosage form as called for by accepted pharmaceutical practice. The amount of active substance in these compositions or preparations is such that a suitable dosage in the range indicated is obtained. Illustrative of the adjuvants which may be incorporated in tablets, capsules and the like are the following a binder such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin an excipient such as microcrystalline cellulose a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, pregelatinized starch, alginic acid, and the like a lubricant such as magnesium stearate a sweetening agent such as sucrose, lactose or saccharin a flavoring agent such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen or cherry. When the dosage unit form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier such as fatty oil. Various other materials may be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical form of the dosage unit. For instance, tablets may be coated with shellac, sugar or both.A syrup or elixir may contain the active compound, sucrose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propyl parabens as preservatives, a dye and a flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor. Sterile compositions for injection can be formulated according to conventional pharmaceutical practice by dissolving or suspending the active substance in a vehicle such as water for injection, a naturally occurring vegetable oil like sesame oil, coconut oil, peanut oil, cottonseed oil, etc. or a synthetic fatty vehicle like ethyl oleate or the like. Buffers, preservatives, antioxidants and the like can be incorporated as required. The following examples are illustrative of the invention and constitute especially preferred embodiments. The preferred diastereomers of these examples are isolated by conventional column chromatography or fractional crystallization. Unless otherwise indicated, all temperatures are in degreesCelsius.

To this solution is added 1.6 g of 4A powdered molecular sieves. A solution of sodium cyanoborohydride 177 mg., 2.83 mmol, in 5 ml of EtOH is added to this suspension by syringe pump at the rate of 1 ml hr.After stirring at room temperature for several days, the reaction mixture is filtered to remove molecular sieves and stripped to a yellow viscous oil. The oil is stirred with Dowex 50 H in a mixture of water and ethanol for 1 hour. This mixture is then added to a Dowex 50 H 50 100 mesh column packed with 50 EtOH.
