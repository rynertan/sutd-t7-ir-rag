# Video display systems.

## Abstract
A video display system has a video signal source for supplying a video signal of odd fields and even fields interlaced each other, a first set of display cells for the odd fields, a second set of display for the even fields, the second set being arranged alternately with the first set of display cells in an interlaced fashion, a first circuit for supplying the video signal of the odd fields to the first set of display cells during first fields, and a second circuit for supplying the video signal of the even fields to the second set of display cells during other fields succeeding the one fields. The first circuit includes a latching circuit 131 for latching the video signal of the odd fields and supplying the latched signal to the first set of display cells during the other fields succeeding the one fields, and the second circuit includes a latching circuit 131 for latching the video signal of the even fields and supplying the latched signal to the second set of display cells during the one fields succeeding the other fields.
