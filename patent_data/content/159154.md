# Test equipment for simulating multipath interference.

## Abstract
Device for simulating multipath interference in order that the correction stages of a radio receiver can be tested. The device includes parallel paths 54, 55, simulating the multipath environment, and a pilot tone generator 60 for introducing pilot tone into the paths. A feed back loop continuously adjusts the phase and amplitude of a segment in one of the paths so as to cancel pilot tone from the output whereby the loop maintains the adjustment need for max ium attenuation at the frequency of the pilot tone.
