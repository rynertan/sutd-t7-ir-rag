# Conveyor for the stepwise advance of a vertically parted boxless mould through a pouring and cooling zone.

## Abstract
In a conveyor for the stepwise advance of a vertically parted boxless mould 3 along a pouring and cooling guideway 4 , the sides of this guideway are composed of reciprocable rods or rails 7, 7 , 8, 8 , at least some of which are operative to carry along the mould in its advance step and which during the advance movement as well as during the periods of standstill keep the mould 3 permanently compressed in its transverse direction to the benefit of the accuracy of the castings produced. For the purpose of limiting the effect of possible expansion forces on the castings before full hardening thereof, at least some of the guideway rods may comprise aligned sections 7 which in case of longitudinal expansion of the mould may be drawn apart against spring resistance 19 .
