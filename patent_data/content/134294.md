## Description
NEW USE OF TRIFLUOROMETHANESULFONANILIDES The present invention relates to a new use of trifluoromethanesulfonanilides. The said trifluoromethanesulfonanilides are representable by the formula EMI1.1 wherein X is a hydrogen atom or an acyl group, Y is a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl group or a halogen atom and R1 and R2, which may be the same or different, are each a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl group, a cyclo lower alkyl group, a lower alkenyl group, a lower alkynyl group, a lower alkoxy group or an acyl group, provided that R1 and R2 are not simultaneously a hydrogen atom or an acyl group. Particularly preferred are those of the formula wherein X is a hydrogen atom or an acyl group, Y is a fluorine atom or a chlorine atom and R1 is a hydrogen atom, a methyl group or an ethyl group and R2 is a methyl group, an ethyl l group or a 2 propynyl group In the above significances, the term lower is intended to mean any group having not more than 8 carbon atoms. Preferably, lower alkyl is alkyl having 1 to 5 carbon atoms, lower alkenyl is alkenyl having 2 to 5 carbon atoms and lower alkynyl is alkynyl having 2 to 5 carbon atoms. Cyclo lower alkyl is preferred to have 3 to 6 carbon atoms, and lower alkoxy is favored to have 1 to 5 carbon atoms. The term acyl represents preferably lower alkanoyl, lower alkenoyl, benzoyl, etc.Examples of the halogen atom includes fluorine, chlorine, etc. It is known that certain kinds of trifluoromethanesulfonanilides are effective as herbicides. For instance, the herbicidal use of 2 methyl 4 N methylsul famoyl trifluoromethanesulfonanilide and 3 N,N dimethyl suifamoyl trifluoromethanesulfonanilide U.S. patent 3,920,444 is known. However, their insecticidal activity has never been known. It has now been found that the trifluoromethanesulfonanilides I exert a remarkable insecticidal activity on a variety of insects belonging to Hemiptera, Lepidoptera,Coleoptera, Diptera, Acarina, etc in agricultural fields e.g. paddy field, crop field , orchards, forest lands, granaries, stored products, sanitary facilities, etc.Specific examples of the insects are as follows 1. herniptera brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens , smaller brown planthopper Laodelphax striatellus , green rice leafhopper Nephotettix cincticeps , green peach aphid Myzus persicae , cotton aphid Aphis gossypii , etc. 2. Lepidoptera rice stem borer Chilo suppressalis , tobacco cutworm Spodoptera litura , diamond back moth Plutella xylostella , egger Dendrolimus spectabilis , cotton leaf worm Spodoptera littoralis , etc. 3. Coleoptera varied carpet beetle Anthrenus verbasci , tobacco beetle Lasioderma serricorne , powder post beetle Lyctus brunneus , etc. 4. Diptera yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti , malaria mosquito Anopheles stephansi , common mosquito tCulex pipiens pallens , housefly Musca domestic etc. 5. Acarina carmine spider mite Tetranychus cinnabarinus , two spotted spider mite tTetranychus urticae , citrus red mite lpanonychus citri , cattle tick Boophllus microplus , etc. Accordingly, the trifluoromethanesultonanilides I are useful as insecticides against a wide variety of harmful insects as above menticned. The trifluoromethanesulfonanilides I are known and may be prepared in such conventional manners as disclosed in U.S. patent 3,920,444 and EP 0072253A.

The composition can be formulated in a per se conventional manner by mixing at least one of the trifluoromethanesulfonanilides I with an appropriate solid, liquid or gaseous carrier s or diluent s with or without an appropriate auxiliary agent s such as surfactants, adherents, dispersants and stabilizers for improving the dispersibility and other properties of the active ingredient. Examples of the solid carriers or diluents are clays e.g. kaolin, diatomaceous earth, synthetic hydrated silica, fubasami clay, bentonite, terra abla , talcs and other inorganic materials e.g. sericite, sulfur powder, active carbon, calcium carbonate, hydrated silica in fine powders or powdery form. Chemical fertilizers e.g.ammonium sulfate, ammonium phosphate, ammonium nitrate, urea, ammonium chloride may be also used as the solid carriers or diluents. Examples of the liquid carriers or diluents are water, alcchols e.g. methanol, ethanol , ketones e.g.acetone, methyl ethyl ketone , aromatic hydrocarbons e.g. benzene, toluene, xylene, ethylbenzene, methylnaphthalene , aliphatic hydrocarbons e.g. n hexane, cyclohexanone, kerosene, petroleum , esters, nitriles, ethers, acid amides e.g. methylformamide, dimethylacc tamide , halogenated hydrocarbons e.g. dichloroethane, trichloroethylene, carbon tetrachloride , etc. As the gaseous carriers or diluents, there may be exemplified treon gas, butane gas, carbon dioxide gas, etc. Examples ot the surfactants are alkylsulfates, alkylsulfonates, alkylarylsultonates, alkylaryl ethers and their condensates with polyoxyethylene, polyethylene glycol ethers, polyhydric alcohol esters, glycitol derivatives, etc. Examples of the adherents and dispersants may include casein, gelatin, polysaccharides e.g. starch powder, gurn arabic, cellulose derivative, alginic acid , lignin sulfate, bentonite, monosaccharides, synthetic watersoluble high polymer e.g. polyvlnyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyacrylic acid , etc.As the stabilizers, there may be used PAP isopropyl acid phosphates , BHT 2,6 di t butyl n methylphenol , BHA mixture of 2 t butyl 4 meth.oxyphencl and 3 t butyl 4 methoxyphenol , natural vegetable oil, mineral oil, the above mentioned surfactants, fatty acids e.g oleic acid, linolic acid, linolenic acid and their esters, etc. The trifluoromethanesulfnanilides I thus formulated into an appropriate composition may be applied as such or in dilution with water in conventional application mode such as spraying, smoking, soil treatment, soil surface treatment or in combination with animal feed. They may be also used together with or in admixture with other insecticides, acaricides, namatocides, fungicides, seed disinfectants, fertilizers, soil improvers. Some practical embodiments of the insecticidal composition according to the invention are illustratively shown in the following examples wherein part s and are by weight. Example 1 Each of Compound Nos. 1 to 49 50 parts and an emulsifier Sorpol 2495 G 1 a mixture of polyoxyethylene alkylaryl ether sulfate and alkylarylsulfonate 5 parts are mixed well, and the resultant mixture is admixed with diatornaceous earth 300 mesh 45 parts in a pulverizer to ae a wettable powder. Example 2 Each of Compound Nos. 1 to 49 10 parts and an emulsifier Sorpol 5029 O sodium laurylsulfate 5 parts are mixed well, and the resultant mixture is admixed with diatomaceous earth 300 mesh 85 parts in a pulverizer to make a wettable powder. Example 3 Each of Compound Nos. 1 to 49 10 parts , an emulsifier Sorpol 3005 X a mixture of polyoxyethylene styrylphenyl ether and alkylarylsulfate 10 parts , di methylformamide 4O parts and xylene 40 parts are mixed well to make an emulsifiable concentrate.

Example 5 Each of Compound Nos. 1 to 49 1 part is dissolved in an appropriate amount of acetone, and talc 300 mesh 99 parts is added thereto. The resultant mixture is stirred and mixed alkyl, followed by evaporation of acetone to wotan dusts. The dosage rate of the trifluoromethanesulfonanilide I as the active ingredient may be from 1 to 1000 grams, preferably from 5 to 200 grams per are, and in the insecticidal composition the content thereof may be from 0.005 to 3C by weight, although they may vary depending upon seasons, places to be applied, modes of application, kinds of insects, degree of damage and so forth.
