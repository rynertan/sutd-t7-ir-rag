# Dual stack power JFET.

## Abstract
A power JFET 2 has a common drift region 4 between a pair of spaced first and second stacks 6, 8 of alternating conductivity type layers 10 14 and 15 19 forming a plurality of channels 11, 13, 16 and 18 . The JFET has an ON state conducting bidirectional current horizontally through the common drift region and the channels. The channels are stacked vertically, and the JFET has an OFF state blocking current flow through the channels due to vertical depletion pinch off. Field shaping and high blocking voltage capability are provided. Particular main terminal and gate structure is disclosed.
