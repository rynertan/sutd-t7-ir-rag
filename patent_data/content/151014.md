# Radio transceiver including an antenna switching circuit.

## Abstract
A radio transceiver includes an antenna 17 , a trans mitter 3 , a receiver 4 , an antenna switching circuit 2a for selectively connecting the transmitter 3 and the receiver 4 to the antenna 17 , a filter 1 connected to the antenna 17 and a series connected first diode 22 and an inductor 23 connected between the end of the filter 1 and point of fixed potential, the junction between the first diode 22 and the inductor 23 being connected to an input of the receiver 4 , and a second diode 21 being connected between the other end of the filter 1 and an output of the transmitter 3 .
