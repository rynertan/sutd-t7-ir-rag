# Surgical staple remover.

## Abstract
A surgical staple remover 10 comprises a first handle element 16 and a second handle element 32 pivotally connected to each other. The front portion 20 of the first handle element 16 terminates in a pair of outwardly extending anvil sections 22,24 having outside surfaces 28,30 that diverge away from each other in the front to rear direction so that different size staples may be received thereon until the staples contact the diverging outside surfaces 28,30 thereof. A blade section 38 on the front portion 36 of the second handle element 32 is constructed and arranged for movement toward and away from the anvil sections 22,24 , and the blade section 38 has a lower concavely curved staple engaging edge 40 . The curved edge 40 engages a staple 12 on the anvil sections 22,24 with a downward and rearward force to produce a U shaped bend in the crown 44 of the staple 12 to thereby facilitate its removal.
