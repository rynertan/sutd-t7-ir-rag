# Method and apparatus for rotating an information storage disc.

## Abstract
Method and apparatus for controllably rotating an information storage disc 11 relative to a radially movable optical transducer 15 whereby information is recorded on the disc in a series of substantially circular and concentrically arranged information tracks. The angular velocity of the disc and the radial velocity of the transducer are controllably adjusted to be inversely proportional to the radius of the particular information track being recorded, whereby the track is moved at a constant linear velocity relative to the transducer 15 and the successive tracks are equally spaced with respect to each other, and whereby a uniform informa tion recording density over the surface of the disc is achieved.
