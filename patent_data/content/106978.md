# Scintillation liquid compatible with high performance liquid chromatography solvents.

## Abstract
A liquid scintillation composition especially useful for gradient elution chromatography comprising an aromatic liquid capable of capturing energy from radiation by radio tagged compositions, at least one fluor, at least one low molecular weight alcohol and a surfactant comprising a polyoxyalkylene unit and a straight chain alkyl unit. Prefer ably, the surfactant comprises an ethoxylated or propoxy lated fatty alcohol or fatty acid in which the moles of ethylene or propylene oxide range from 5 to 25 and the length of the alkyl chain is between 6 and 20 carbon atoms.
