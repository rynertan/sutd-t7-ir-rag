## Abstract
A microbiological culture test process for detecting the presence of nitrate reducing microorganism in an inoculum sample, which comprises a culturing a microorganism to be tested in the presence of adequately nitrite free nitrate, for a period sufficient to allow reduction of nitrate by any microorganism if present that has the capacity to reduce nitrate to nitrite, e.g. 1 6 hours b exposing the culture medium after culture to diazotis ing acid conditions in the presence of an amino containing fluorophor thereby to cause diazotisation of the fluorophor to the extent of any nitrite present in the medium to form a diazonium derivative or further reaction product thereof which is substantially less fluorescent or fluoresces at a substantially different wavelength than said amino containing fluorophor, and c assessing the fluorescence of the culture medium as treated by step b , thereby to show a reduction in fluorescence in the presence of a nitrate reducing microorganism.
