# RESILIENT ASSEMBLIES

## Abstract
A resilient assembly can be given extremely high stiffness and strength against compressive loads while allowing shear movement and shear torsion by reinforcing the resilient mass 5 of rubber with high tensile cords 6 lying parallel to each other in a direction to resist the tendency of extension of the rubber under compression.
