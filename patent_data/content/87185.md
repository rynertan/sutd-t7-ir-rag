# Manufacture of electrode with lead base.

## Abstract
An electrode having a lead base and a catalyst is manufactured by a compressing titanium sponge particles so as to consolidate them to a coherent porous layer, b applying the catalyst to the titanium sponge particles, and c fixing the layer of consolidated sponge particles to the lead base. The catalyst is formed on the titanium sponge particles before or after their consolidation to a coherent layer. This layer may be produced and fixed to the base in a single compressing and fixing step combining a and c . Oxygen is anodically evolved at a reduced, stable potential by means of this electrode, so that it can be usefully applied as an anode in processes for electrowinning metals from acid electro lytes.
