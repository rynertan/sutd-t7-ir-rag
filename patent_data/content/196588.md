# PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF COPOLYMERS OF N SUBSTITUTED SECONDARY MONOALLYLAMINES OR SALTS THEREOF

## Abstract
A water soluble radical initiator containing an azo group in the molecule is used as polymerization initiator in a polar solvent for enabling efficient copolymerization of N substituted secondary monoallylamines, which have been considered hard to polymerize, with other monomers.
