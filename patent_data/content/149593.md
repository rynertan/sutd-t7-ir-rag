# Novel thiopeptolide substrates for vertebrate collagenase.

## Abstract
The disclosure relates to novel synthetic thiopeptolide substrates having high activity for the enzyme collagenase. These substrates have the following amino acid sequences R Pro X Gly S Y Z Gly R₁ wherein R H or N protecting group, X Leu, Ile, Phe, Val, Gly, Ala, Y Leu, Ile, Phe, Val, Ala, Z Leu, Ile, Phe, Val, Gln, Ala, and R₁ terminal amide, carboxyl or ester group.
