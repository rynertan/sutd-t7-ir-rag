# Electrically photosensitive particles for electrophoretic migration imaging processes, dispersions of these particles, and processes using such dispersions.

## Abstract
Electrically photosensitive particles very suitable for use in electrophoretic migration imaging processes comprise a colorant, which may or may not itself be electrically photosensitive, dispersed in a binder polymer this polymer comprising units containing one or more of the structures i triarylamine, ii p aminotetraarylmethane, iii 4,4 bis p amino triarylmethane, iv 1,1 bis p aminoaryl isobutane, v 1,1 bis p aminoaryl cyclohexane, vi N alkyl N, N diarylamine vii N alkenyl N, N diarylamine, Viii N, N dialkyl N arylamine, and ix heterocyclic containing at least one nitrogen atom and from 3 to 12 carbon atoms in the ring structure which may include at least one fused ring. The particles are used for imaging as a dispersion in an electrically insulating carrier.
