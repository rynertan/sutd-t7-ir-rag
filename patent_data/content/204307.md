## Description
This invention relates to a film end holding device in which a photosensitive material such as sheet film taken up on a recording drum of a drum type image scanning and recording apparatus and drawn by vacuum suction is prevented from being released from a surface of the drum during rotation thereof. In the recording section of a conventional drum type image scanning and recording apparatus, it is known that a photosensitive material such as sheet film or photographic printing paper hereinafter referred to as film is detained at its initial end portion by engaging at least two slits formed near the film end at a certain distance with pins disposed on the periphery of each drum in parallel to the axis at the same distance and number as said slits, and or fixed by taping. Then such film are taken up on a recording drum being squeezed by a squeezing roller or under a certain tension, and the film end is either detained by terminal end pins or fixed to the drum by taping, etc. Further, the film is extensively fastened to the periphery of the recording drum being drawn by vacuum suction by way of a lot of small apertures formed on the periphery. By such film holding method, since the films are treated in a dark room, particularly the film end fixation to the drum surface by taping is difficult. Moreover, it is necessary for the terminal end of the film to be pasted up so as not to occur any distortion in the recording image linear distortion, desirable accuracy is less than 10 µm while keeping the appropriate tension to the film, but such paste up operation requires a certain level of skill and becomes more difficult when the film size is larger. This means that the results of pasting up operation are different depending on individual workers. A further problem exists in that surfaces of the drum and the film are stained by adhesive materials of tapes. Furthermore, when the initial end of a film is detained by two pins for example, a sagging may occur in the midle portion of the film due to the weight of the film itself eventually causing the linear distortion in the recording image. When it is tried that a film is fixed to the drum surface by using vacuum suction alone without pinning and taping, a still further problem arises that in the case of power failure or malfunction of a vacuum suction device, the film is unavoidably and unexpectedly released from the drum surface, which means a loss. It is also known to fix a film to the drum surface by using vacuum suction and to clamp the film with a single mechanical one piece unit of spring steel see IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin, Vol. 16, No 11, April 1974, pages 3627 3628 . Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide a film end holding device in which known manual operation of fixing initial and terminal ends of a film to a surface of a recording drum in a dark room is successfully replaced with a quite simple holding operation without requiring an operator to touch the film, fixation of the initial and terminal ends of the film to the drum surface can be performed on required conditions at any operating position so as not to butt against an objective lens of a recording unit without occurence of linear distortion in a recording image due to film setting. Such film end holding device will make a step forward to an automatic film setting and detaching device in the future whereby unexpected release of a film is completely prevented. In order to solve the above discussed problem, a film end holding device in accordance with the invention is arranged as follows. That is, in a drum 2 on the periphery of which a film 1 is mounted being taken up thereon, a portion of the drum near an end of the film 1 is provided with a film holding plate 15 , an operating plate 17 , a plurality of guide bushes 13 and a contact member 18 said holding plate 15 has a plurality of guide slots 14 in circumpherential direction of the drum 2 , an extending side of the holding plate 15 opposed to the end of the film 1 is formed into an angular portion with its front end bent to be a film contact portion 19 , while the opposite extending side is bent to be a turnup 20 said operating plate 4 has a plurality of guide slots 16 oblique to the axial direction of the drum 2 for sliding in the axial direction of the drum within bent portions of the holding plate 15 said contact member 18 of sufficient regidity is fixed to the drum 2 by engaging said guide slots 14 , 16 of the holding plate 15 and the operating plate 17 with said guide bushes 13 so that the holding plate 15 may slide in the circumpherential direction on the surface of the drum while holding the operating plate 17 inside by means of a plurality of set bolts 11 through said guide bushes 13 said operating plate 17 moves obliquely when pushed in the axial direction of the drum, whereby the holding plate 15 moves in the circumpherential direction of the drum 2 by a length of the guide slots 14 and the operating plate 17 runs on the angle portion of the holding plate 15 so that the end of the film 1 may be held by curving the contact portion 19 of the holding plate 15 toward the surface of the drum 2 . Further, a sheet plate 12 is fixed to the drum 2 by way of the bush 13 so that the holding plate 15 may be easy to slide in the curcumpherential direction on the surface of the drum 2 . In addition, the operating plate 17 is chamfered in such manner that the extending portion thereof contacting an upper inclined surface of the angle shaped portion of the holding plate 15 serves in cooperation with an upper inclined surface of the holding plate 15 so that the operating plate 17 may easily run on the holding plate 15 . When the operating plate 17 is pushed from outside along the axial direction of the drum 2 , since the slots 16 are formed in the operating plate 17 obliquely to the pushing direction and the guide bushes 13 fixed to the drum 2 are engaged with the guide slits 16 , the operating plate 17 moves obliquely. Further, the operating plate 17 superposed on the holding plates 15 15 between the upper inclined surface of the extending side opposed to the end of the film 1 and the turnup 20 , and the guide slits 14 of the holding plates 15 15 engaged with the guide bushes 13 are formed orthogonally to the pushing direction. Accordingly, the holding plates 15 15 are moved only in the direction orthogonal to the axial direction of the drum 2 by the operating plate 17 which moves obliquely. When the operating plate 17 being further pushed, since the holding plates 15 15 are detained by the contact of the guide bushes 13 with inner end face of the guide slits 14 , an extending side of the operating plate 17 runs on the upper inclined surface of the angular extending side of the holding plates 15 15 , thereby the holding plates 15 15 coming near the end of the film 1 are curved toward the drum 2 side and the film contact portion 19 holds the end portion of the film 1 . Being the aforementioned constitution and function, the film end holding device according to the invention can be simply attached to the drum, and particularly the delicate munual operation of fixing the initial and terminal ends of a film to the surface of the recording drum by taping, etc. in a dark room can be replaced with a simple pushing operation. Thus, the fixation of the initial and terminal ends of the film to the drum surface on required conditions can be easily performed even by an unskilled worker irrespective of one s skill. Since the film contact portion of the holding plate does not contact the film when moving, the film can be well prevented from being corrugated or damaged due to paste up at the time of fixing it to the drum. Since corrugation due to paste up does not occur and pinning of the film is omitted, the film is free from sagging. Furthermore, since it is not required for a worker to touch the film, any external force which may cause a distortion to the film is not applied to the film, and as a result a recording image is prevented from linear distortion due to film setting operation. In the drawings forming a part of this application, Referring now to the accompanying drawings, embodiments according to the invention are described hereinafter. In Fig. 1 film end holding devices B , E , one for initial end of a film and the other for terminal end thereof, are fitted on a recording drum of a drum type image recording apparatus, and Figs. 2 and 3 show a partial plan view and a sectional view of the device for initial end side of the film. The film 1 is taken up on the recording drum 2 being squeezed by a squeezing roller not shown so as not to occur sagging, after engaging a pair of film positioning pins 3 disposed on the peripheral surface of the recording drum 2 in parallel to the axial direction thereof with apertures usually one is round shaped, and the other elongated formed adaptable to said pins 3 near the initial end of the film 1 . The film 1 is then drawn by vacuum saction through lots of small apertures formed through from the peripheral surface of the drum 2 to a hollow portion 4 , and fixed to the drum 2 being held by the film end holding devices B and E on which the initial and terminal ends of the film 1 are respectively fitted. Described hereunder is a construction of the device B for initial end of the film referring to Fig. 4. The film end holding device B comprises a belt like sheet plate 12 fixed on the peripheral surface of the drum 2 by a bolt 11 with its longitudinal direction coincident to the axial direction of the drum, a holding plate 15 superposed on the sheet plate 12 with its longitudinal direction coincident to that of the sheet plate and on which a guide slot 14 is formed so that a guide bush 13 engaged with the bolt 11 with a hexagonal set hole may slide in the slot in the circumpherential direction of the drum, an operating plate 17 superposed on the holding plate 15 with its longitudinal direction coincident to that of the holding plate 15 and on which a guide slot 16 is formed so that said guide bush 13 may slide in the slot obliquely to the circumpherential direction of the drum, and a contact member 18 superposed on the operating plate 17 with its longitudinal direction coincident to that of the actuation plate and on which a stepped aperture for receiving a head of the bolt 11 is formed so that the sheet plate 12 may be held on the surface of the drum 2 through the guide bush 13 by the bottom face of the bolt 11 when the bolt is tightened. Thread portion of the bolt 11 with a hexagonal set hole is screwed in one of a plurality of tapped holes 11 for example, 8 holes formed on the peripheral surface of the drum 2 in the axial direction at a certain distance p for example, about 100 mm . Accordingly, the rectangular guide slots 14 formed on the holding plate 15 orthogonal to the longitudinal direction of the plate 15 i.e., rotational direction of the drum 2 and the guide slots 16 formed on the operating plate 17 oblique to the longitudinal direction of the plate 17 are arranged in the same number as the tapped holes 11 in the same axial direction. Since the length of the guide bush 13 is so designed as to be a little larger than the total thickness of the holding plate 15 and the operating plate 17 , when the bolt 11 with a hexagonal set hole is tightened and the contact member 18 brings the sheet plate 12 into contact with the surface of the drum 2 throught the guide bush 13 , this guide bush 13 serves also as a kind of spacer, so that the holding plate 15 and the operating plate 17 can slide between the sheet plate 12 and the contact member 18 , although the contact member 18 and the sheet plate 12 are fixed on the surface of the drum 2 . The sheet plate 12 is disposed for the purpose of forming a sliding surface on the drum 2 on which the holding plate 15 can slide smoothly without damaging the surface of the drum 2 in the direction of the arrow 50 see Fig. 4 , i.e., in the direction approaching to the initial end of the film 1 on the plane contacting the peripheral surface of the drum 2 . The setting hole on the sheet plate 12 for insertion of the bolt 11 is not located on the center line thereof but near the initial end side of the film 1 so that, when the holding plate 15 comes near the initial end of the film 1 , a sufficient overhang from the sheet plate 12 may be insured and that flexibility be easily produced in the holding plate 15 by the operation of the operating plate 17 . Width of the holding plate 15 is formed larger than that of the sheet plate 12 so that the greater part of the bottom face of the holding plate 15 may contact the sheet plate 12 and make parallel displacement with respect to the sheet plate 12 when moving toward the initial end side of the film 1 by the actuation of the operating plate 17 . An extending side of the holding plate opposed to the initial end of the film 1 is bent to form an angle, and the front end portion thereof is further bent to form a small turnup 19 which acts as a contact portion to the film 1 , while the opposite extending side is bent upward making a right angle to form a turnup 20 . The operating plate 17 is composed of a belt like plate a little thicker than the holding plate 15 . When the operating plate 17 is not operated, it is stored between the upwardly inclined surface of the angle portion of the holding plate 15 opposed to the initial end side of the film 1 and the turnup 20 as shown in Figs. 2 and 3, and therefore the extending side of the actuation plate 17 contacting the upwardly inclined surface of the angle portion of the holding plate 15 is chamfered to serve in cooperation with said inclined surface. Both end portions of the operating plate 17 are bent upward to form a turnup 21 , and as to the length, the operating plate 17 is longer than the holding plate 15 by an actuation stroke in the longitudinal direction. The contact member 18 is so designed that a section thereof may have rigidity sufficiently larger than those of the holding plate 15 and the operating plate 17 , and accordingly when centrifugal force produced respectively in the contact member 18 itself, the holding plate 15 and the operating plate 17 act on the contact member 18 , no flexibility occurs in the portion between the bolts 11 . Flexibility produced in the holding plate 15 and the operating plate 17 due to their centrifugal forces may be restrained by the contact member 18 . As for the length, the contact member 18 is a little shorter than the holding plate 15 to prevent the operating plate 17 from interference thereof. In addition, an objective lens of the recording head is distant from the surface of the film fixed to the drum 2 by only 7 mm or so, and therefore a head of the bolt 11 projecting highest from the surface of the drum 2 of all other members in this film end holding device B is designed so as not to butt against the objective lens. Then the film end holding device E for holding the terminal end of a film in this embodiment comprises almost the same components as the film end holding device B for holding the initial end described above. But in the case of the terminal end holding device E , since the terminal end of a film is not detained by positioning pins 3 at the pin holes being different form the initial end and there is the possibility that the terminal end floats lifting from the surface of the drum 2 due to the certrifugal force at the time of high speed rotation, it is necessary for the film 1 to be firmly held. Further, as shown in Fig. 6, in the case of the terminal end of the film, since a free end thereof from the small aperture 5 for drawing by vacuum suction is designed longer than a free end of the initial end from the positioning pin 3 , there arise following differences between the holding devices B and E in their constructions. In Fig. 6 showing a sectional side view of the film end holding devices B and E , the extending side of the holding plate 15 on the terminal end side of the film 1 is trapezoidally shaped with a plain portion on its top. In order to insure a sufficient overhang of the turnup 19 acting as a film holding section from the sheet plate 12 , and to curve the holding plate 15 sufficient for holding the rear end of the film 1 at the turnup 19 , the width of the actuation plate 17 is secured sufficiently large so as to be able to increase actuation strokes. Accordingly, in the holding plate 15 , a distance between the upwardly inclined surface of the angle portion on the extending side opposed to the rear end of the film 1 and the turnup 20 on the opposite side is enlarged. Operation of the film end holding device B for the initial end is now described. First, the film 1 is supposed to be taken up on the peripheral surface of the drum 2 and drawn by vacuum suction not to sag while the film positioning pin 3 being engaged with the pin hole on the initial end of the film 1 . Then in the state shown in Fig. 2, the operating plate 17 is pushed by the turnup 21 in the direction of the arrow 51 , i.e., in the axial direction. Since the guide bush 13 fixed to the drum 2 is engaged with the guide slot 16 formed right upward on the operating plate 17 , the operating plate pushed in the direction of the arrow moves to left downward in Fig. 2. Since the operating plate 17 is held between the turnup 20 and the upwardly inclined surface of the angle portion of the holding plate 15 , the holding plate 15 moves together with the operation of the operating plate 17 , but downward, i.e., in the direction of the arrow 52 as shown in Fig. 5 A . This is because the guide slot 14 of the holding plate 15 engaging with the guide bush 13 is formed orthogonally to the longitudinal direction. In this manner, the holding plate 15 is moved so that the turnup 19 on the front end thereof may be superposed on the initial end of the film 1 . Fig. 5 A shows such state, and wherein since the holding plate 15 is in contact with the guide bush 13 at the upper end face of the guide slot 14 , the holding plate cannot move downward any more. Accordingly, when further pushing the operating plate 17 in the direction of the arrow, the guide bush 13 comes to contact the upper end face of the guide slot 16 , and the operating plate 17 reaches the stroke end. Meanwhile, the operating plate 17 moves left downward over the holding plate 15 under the immovable state, and the obliquely chamfered extending side of the operating plate 17 runs on the upwardly inclined surface of the angle portion of the holding plate 15 . Since the holding plate 15 is formed of a flexible material as compared with the operating plate 17 , the front end portion thereof is curved on the drum 2 side so that the turnup 19 may hold the initial end of the film 1 on the surface of the drum 2 . When pushing the operating plate 17 at the left side turnup 21 in the opposite direction of the arrow 51 , the operation is performed in reverse order and the film end holding state is released. In the case of the film end holding device E for the terminal end of a film, as is shown in Fig. 5 B , a guide slot 16 is formed with its left side obliquely upward on the operating plate 17 . When pushing this operating plate 17 in the direction of the arrow 51 is pushed at the turnup 21 in the direction of the arrow 51 , the holding plate 15 moves upward, i.e., in the direction of the arrow 53 . The guide slot 16 is formed with its left side obliquely upward because in the film fixation in a dark room, it is preferable that both initial end E and terminal end B are treated to move in the same direction i.e., in the direction of the arrow 51 . The operation described above can be also performed automatically other than the manual operation. By fixing an actuator such as an air cylinder 31 at a certain height to left and right bearings 30 30 supporting a rotary shaft of the drum 2 , as shown in Fig. 7, the operating plate 17 can be pushed left and right by the turnup 21 through a roller rotatably fitted to a front end of the actuation rod. It is also preferable that the operating plates 17 17 are provided with click stops not shown so as not move during the rotation of the drum. Referring then to Fig. 8, operation of the film end holding device E for terminal end is described hereunder. Fig. 8 a shows a state that the holding plate 15 has begun to move toward the rear part of the film 1 by pushing the operating plate 17 in the longitudinal direction. Fig. 8 b shows a state that the guide slot 14 of the holding plate 15 has contacted the guide bush 13 and the holding plate 15 has been moved by the operating plate 17 to the position not movable any more. Under such state, the turnup 19 of the holding plate 15 is positioned near above the terminal end of the film 1 but not in contact with the film 1 . In Fig. 8 c , the operating plate 17 is further pushed in the longitudinal direction and, as a result, the operating plate 17 runs on the upwardly inclined surface of the angle portion of the holding plate 15 to the extent of curving the holding plate 15 downward, i.e., toward the drum 2 side. Since the side of the holding plate 15 opposed to the terminal end of the film is trapezoidally formed with a plain part on its top and a overhang of the turnup 19 acting as a holding section extending from the sheet plate 12 is secured as described above, even a small movement of the longer side of the angle portion attains a large displacement toward the drum 2 side at the turnup 19 . Further, since the holding plate 15 is composed of a flexible material, even when the angular side is excessively pushed by the operating plate 17 , the holding plate 15 bends over the overhand sufficiently extended to the turnup 19 so that the turnup 19 may hold the terminal end of the film 1 . As seen from Fig. 9 showing a partial plan view of the holding plate 15 and Fig. 10 showing a sectional side view taken along the line X X of Fig. 9, it is also preferred that the holding plate 15 is provided with several slit like apertures 22 in order to reduce the centrifugal force acting on the holding plate 15 during high speed rotation of the drum 2 and to produce easily the flexibility by the operation of the operating plate 17 . In addition, it is necessary for the actuation stroke of the actuator 31 for the operating plate 17 of the film end holding device B for the initial end to be adapted to the film end holding device E for the terminal end. Unbalance occured in the drum 2 due to attachment of this device should be appropriately corrected beforehand. As a matter of course, embodiment of the film end holding device B for the initial end alone is in the scope of the invention.
