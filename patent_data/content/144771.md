# ELECTROCHEMICAL CELL HAVING A PLURALITY OF BATTERY STACKS

## Abstract
Electrochemical cell having at least two battery stacks 20 each including an electrode assembly wound on a spool 21 . Each electrode assembly includes two elongated elec trode structures, an anode electrode structure 32 and a cathode current collector structure 31 and 32 . The electrode structures 31 and 32 are wound around the center post 25 of the spool 21 with the anode electrode structure 32 making contact with one of the conductive flanges 22 of the spool 21 and the cathode current collector structure 31 making electrical contact with the other conductive flange 23 of the spool 21 . The flanges 23 in contact with the anode structures 31 of the battery stacks 20 are connected to one external terminal 10 of the cell, and the flanges in contact with the cathode current collector structures of the battery stacks are connected to another external terminal of the cell.
