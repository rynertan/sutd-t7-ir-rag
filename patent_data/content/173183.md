# Radiation resistant optical conductor.

## Abstract
It is disclosed that a radiation resistant optical conductor, such as an optical fiber for telecommunication, a multiple fiber for an image scope, and a light guide for illumination, which comprises a core composed of a pure silica glass which is pre pared via an ultrahigh temperature of at least 3,000 C and has an OH group content of from 0.1 to 300 ppm, and a cladding layer formed on the core, and the cladding layer being com posed of a silica glass which contains boron element and fluo rine element as a dopant.
