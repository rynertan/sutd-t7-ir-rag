# A paging system, particularly for hotels.

## Abstract
In a paging system for hotel guests, use is made of the pigeonhouse like structure 18 , wherein keyholders 20 are deposited by the guests, for indicating to the telephone switchboard operator of the hotel whether a guest is available for an incoming call, rather than referring it to the reception desk 12 . Each compartment of the structure is provided with keyholder presence absence indicating means 24,26 which are coupled to the telephone switchboard 10 . The absence of a keyholder will indicate that the guest is in his room, or that he is elsewhere on the hotel premises. In the latter case, the operator will transmit a paging signal to a receiver installed in the respective keyholder. Special requirements of guests may be accommodated through the use of dummy keyholders, replacing the normal keyholders within the structure.

## Description
The present invention relates to a system for establishing communication between a central station and any individual out of a selected group of subjects present within a defined area. More particularly, the invention concerns a paging system wherein from a central station messages can be broadcast to a preselected holder of a receiver device which by a certain signal such as a beep can be alerted that his presence is required at a certain location or that he must reach for the nearest telephone. Still more specifically, the system according to the present invention is tailormade for use in hotels, as will be apparent from the description hereinbelow. Paging systems of the kind referred to above are commonly used in hospitals, industrial plants, airports, and the like, wherein key personnel members are equipped with a small, clip mounted receiver, which is responsive, within the range of the premises, to a radio signal transmitted by a central station. There are various degrees of sophistication of the receivers used, namely, for one way reception, whereby only a beep or an audio message can be produced, or two way transceivers which allow an asnwer back signal by the recipient or even a conversation to take place. Focusing now on the specific circumstances usually prevailing in hotels, certain particularities should be taken into account. Concerning a guest staying in the hotel, there are mainly three possibilities That he is in his room and willing to take outside calls that he is located in his room but must not be disturbed that he is outside his room but still within the hotel premises and again willing unwilling to answer calls and that he left the hotel and is therefore not available. Another characteristic fact, which this invention makes use of, is that every guest is provided with a key to his room which, customarily, goes together with a relatively large size and heavy keyholder. Now, as known, at the reception desk of all hotels there is provided a pigeonhouse like structure with numbers of the rooms thereon, each pigeon hole is adapted to accommodate a keyholder. Guests are requested to leave the keyholder with the receptionist when leaving the hotel. Therefore, the presence or absence of a keyholder within its pigeonhole is a first hand indication of the availability of the guest for outside telephone calls or visitors. The procedure, therefore, is such that when a guest is requested on the phone, the telephone operator situated as a rule remotely of the reception desk first dials the room number. If no answer is received, the operator will refer the call to the receptionist desk, where, by a glance at the keyholders depositing structure, the clerk can tell whether the guest presumably left the hotel, namely, when the keyholder was returned to its place. In the case that the keyholder has not been deposited, there may be the possibility that the guest is somewhere else in the hotel, say in the dining room or swimming pool, and the clerk would ask whether he should announce the guest s name on the loudspeaker. Then either the guest is located or not. From the foregoing description, it is evident that the locating or paging of guests in hotels is cumbersome, ineffective, and expensive in terms of time expended by the hotel s relevant personnel members, namely, the telephone switchboard operator and the receptionist. It is therefore a major object of the present invention to overcome the inherent deficiencies of the present guest paging procedures in hotels. It is a further object of the invention to provide telecommunication or transceiver based paging systems for hotels, but such that will be less sophisticated and therefore less expensive than the first above mentioned, general use paging system. It is a still further object of the invention to make use of the guest s keyholders as a receiving unit of the paging system. It is still further object of the present invention to utilize the presence absence of a keyholder, within any of the existing pigeonhouse structure chambers, as automatic indicating means for informing the telephone operator of the availability of the guest whose location is required. It is a still further object of the invention to make use of dummy keyholders as means of information satisfying specific requirements of the guests. By obtaining any and all of the above listed objects, a paging system is provided that will satisfy almost completely the requirements of most hotels without large investments in equipment, installation and specially trained personnel. According to a broad aspect of the invention, there is provided a paging system, particularly for hotels which include a reception station and a remotely located telephone switchboard station. The reception station is provided with a pigeonhouse like structure for storing the hotel room keyholders deposited by the hotel guests. The system is characterised by first indicating means associated with the said structure for indicating the presence absence of a keyholder in from any of the pigeonholes of the said structure and by second indicating means associated with the telephone switchboard station, and coupled to the said first indicating means, for reproducing the indication of the first indicating means. Transceiver means are provided, operable from the switchboard station for transmitting paging radio signals to receiver means installed in the keyholders. Audio signal emitting means are installed in the keyholders, responsive to the said radio signals for alerting the inquired guest. The first indicating means may comprise a normally open switch, adapted to be closed by the weight of the keyholder, thereby actuating a corresponding sign on a display board constituting the said second indicating means, or it may comprise a T.V. camera device coupled to a monitor that gives the telephone operator a reproduced picture of the pigeonhouse structure, or any selected pigeonhole thereof. According to a further, optional feature of the invention, dummy keyholders may be used, to be located within their respective chambers in special cases where a guest is, in fact, at the hotel but wishes not to be disturbed. These dummy keyholders will operate the switching means or be viewed by the T.V. camera giving thereby an indication as if the guest has left the hotel although the real keyholder is in his possession . For better understanding the essence of and the features as well as advantages of the present invention, reference shall be made to one out of many possible examples embodying the invention given in an unlimiting way, with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein In Fig. 1b, there is shown a telephone switchboard station generally indicated 10, and a remotely located reception station 12 comprising a counter 14, a telephone set 16 and the conventional pigeonhouse like structure 18 comprised of a plurality of numbered pigeonholes 20 wherein keyholders 22 Fig. 2 are left in the absence of the respective guest. All these form part and parcel of every conventional hotel and need not be described in further detail. According to the invention, however, there are introduced the following additions and changes in the conventional system. Next to the telephone operator desk there is provided a display board 24 divided into numbered display sections 26 corresponding to the pigeonholes 20 of the structure 18. The board 24 may be comprised of windows with LED devices positioned in each section and suitably coupled to their respective pigeonholes 20. Actuation of each device is controlled by a microswitch device 28 installed within each compartment 20, the arrangement being such that placing of a keyholder 22 within the compartment closes the microswitch 28, e.g. by means of a lever 30. When the keyholder 22 is withdrawn, the switch resumes its open position. Of course, other modes of operation may be utilized, such as photocells and the like proximity detector devices. Alternatively, rather than a separate display board, a digital or the like display system may be incorporated in the telephone switchboard, suitably coupled to the switches or equivalent devices 28, so that the operator may directly communicate with any preselcted compartment 20 and ascertain the status thereof in the above mentioned regard. The telephone operator s station 10 is further provided with a transceiver unit 32 which, again, may form part of the switchboard adapted to transmitt coded radio signals, e.g. by push button keyboard 34, which radio signals are adapted to be received and operate receiver devices installed within the keyholder 22 provided, of course, that the keyholder is located within the range of the transceiver 32. The keyholder receiver not shown may be the most simple type, namely, adapted to emit a beep type audio signal through openings 36 at the cap portion of the holder 22 upon receiving the coded radio signal, may enable the reception of a spoken message or allow a two way conversation. In an alternative form encompassed by the instant invention, there may be provided a T.V. camera 38 monitoring the structure 18 in a closed circuit, whereby the board 24 in form of a monitor screen will be an exact reproduction of the actual frontal view of the keyholder structure, readily observed by the telephone operator. If necessary, suitable control means may be provided for zooming the camera 38 to attain a better view of any selected portion of the keyholder housing 18. The operation of the system will now be briefly explained Should an incoming call be received by the operator, asking for a certain guest, the operator will be able, at a glance, to tell whether the guest is available or not, by ascertaining the keyholder presence within or absence from its pigeonhole. If the keyholder has been deposited, the operator will only have to ask whether to leave a message, and if the answer is in the affirmative, to refer the call to the reception desk 12 if no message is to be left, the receptionist will not have to be bothered at all. Should the respective pigeonhole of the required guest be vacant, the operator will assume that the guest is in his room and dial its number. If no answer is received, and the inquiring party insists upon, the operator will transmit a locating signal by its transmitter 32 whereby the guest, wherever he may be around the hotel premises, becomes advised that he is required to reach for the nearest telephone. This procedure will, of course, save the presently used inconvenient and disturbing loudspeaker announcing paging method through the reception personnel. The paging system as so far described can be used to satisfy special requests of guests, such as instructions not to be disturbed by incoming calls including visitors despite being around in their rooms or elsewhere on the hotel premises. This will be effectively achieved by one or the other of the following methods. First, the switch 28 may be externally unabled, i.e. as if a keyholder has been deposited, and thereby the telephone operator will receive a sign representing the guest is not available. Alternatively, there may be used dummy keyholders, say, a different color or shape, that will be placed within the respective pigeonholes 20 to operate the switches 28. This will indicate to the telephone operator and to the reception clerk that the guest is, in fact, at the hotel but wishes not to receive telephone calls and or visitors. It has thus been established that by most simple means, an especially suitable and effective paging system for hotels is achieved which, no doubt, will payback the costs of its investment very quickly in terms of saved manpower, time, and better service to the hotel guests. Having thus described the invention with particular reference to the preferred embodiments thereof, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art to which the invention pertains, that various changes and modifications may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, as defined by the claims appended hereto. Thus, for example, the novel paging system may be applied to industrial plants or offices as combined means for indicating and or recording the arrivals and leave of workmen for the manpower department purposes , and locating same when required. In those cases, a suitable article other than a keyholder say, a pen like object will be used. As will also be readily understood, battery charging means may be incorporated in each compartment of the pigeonhouse structure for maintaining the power of the receivers while the keyholders are stored.
