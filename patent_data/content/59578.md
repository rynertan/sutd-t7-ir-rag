# Valve assembly for glassware forming machines.

## Abstract
A valve assembly for controlling the application of suction and counterblow air to a blank mould of a glassware forming machine. The assembly comprises body 1, 2, 3, 4 in which are enclosed a first valve 5 for controlling the application of suction, a second valve 6 for controlling the flow of counterblow air, and a third valve 7 for venting the blank mould. The body 1, 2, 3, 4 has a central chamber 32 through which the suction is applied when the first valve 5 is open, through which the counterblow air passes when the second valve 6 is open, and through which the mould is vented when the third valve 7 is open.
