# Sonar arrangements.

## Abstract
A sonar beam steering arrangement in which a circular array of electroacoustic transducers 21 are sampled in sequence, the samples being digitised and stored serially in a shift register 27 . The register is several cycles long so that samples from all of the illuminated transducers 21 can be stored simultaneously. The various stages have resistance tappings R1, R2 etc of different values such that a linear broadside array is simulated for a particular transducer at a particular stage in the shift register cycle. As the samples progress through the register each transducer 21 in turn acquires this simulated broadside array and thus provides a narrow beam 360 scan. Interpolation between adjacent transducer dead ahead directions is obtained by e.g. triplicating the shift register and adjusting the weightings slightly from each register to the next.
