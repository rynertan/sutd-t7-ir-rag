# Pre expanded particle of polyolefin and process for preparing the same.

## Abstract
A pre expanded particle suitable for foaming in a mold comprising polyolefin which has a characteristic property that an inclination of slope line obtained on a graph when logarithmic values of melt tension of the polyolefin are plotted as ordinate and reciprocals of absolute temperature at which the melt tension is measured are plotted as ab scissa is less than 1,500 is provided. A foamed article produced from the pre expanded particles has an excellent appearance, a flat surface and good mechanical strength, and is useful for wrapping material, insulating material, a container or a fender of cars. A process for preparing the above mentioned pre expanded particles is also disclosed.
