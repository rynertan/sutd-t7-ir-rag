# Polyamides from MDI and aliphatic dicarboxylic acids.

## Abstract
Disclosed are injection moldable, rapidly crystallizable compositions comprising A a linear polyamide selected from the series poly 4, 4 methylenediphenylene azelamide to dodecanediamide and B an amount sufficient to prom ote the crystallization of the linear polyamide, of a material selected from the group of i talc, ii sodium benzenesulfon ate, iii a polyethylene ionomer, iv a methacrylated buta diene styrene, and v a multi phase composite inter polymer. The compositions crystallize rapidly from the molten state which allows for economically attractive molding procedures including fiber production and the production of aromatic aliphatic polyamides having a combination of excellent properties.
