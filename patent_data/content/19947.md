# Process for the manufacture of objects from thermosetting resin.

## Abstract
A process for applying a cover layer based on thermosetting resin to objects of thermosetting resin. The process is characterized in that a shape imparting support face is heated to a temperature of 90 200 C and then is provided with a cover layer of a thermosetting resin with catalyst. After hardening the cover layer and cooling below 90 C a basic layer thermosetting resin is applied and hardened.
