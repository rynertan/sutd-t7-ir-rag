# Improvements relating to rotary printing presses.

## Abstract
A rotary printing press includes a laser beam imaging device 5 to enable a rotary printing member 1 to be prepared whilst it is located in the printing press. This arrangement has particular advantages when it is used with a lithographic or a gravure printing press and especially when used as a proofing press for colour lithography or colour gravure.
