# Semiconducting compositions and wires and cables using the same.

## Abstract
A semiconducting composition comprising A a random copolymer of propylene and an alpha olefin having at least 4 carbon atoms as main constituents which contains 50 to 87 mole of the propylene units, B fine particles of carbon black, and as an optional com ponent, C at least one random copolymer selected from the group consisting of a random copolymer of ethylene and a vinyl ester having 4 or 5 caarbon atoms as main constituents, which contains at least about 5.4 mole of the vinyl ester units, and a random copolymer of ethylene and an unsatu rated carboxylic acid ester having 4 to 8 carbon atoms as main constituents, which contains at least 3 mole of the unsatu rated carboxyiic acid ester units. The semiconducting composition or its crosslinked pro duct is useful as an outside semiconducting layer in a power cable composed at least of a central conductor, a crosslinked polyethylene insulating layer surrounding the conductor and an outside semiconducting layer surrounding the insulating layer.
