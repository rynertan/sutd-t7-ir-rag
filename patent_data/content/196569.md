# Process for preparing polyalkylene oxide having unsaturated end groups.

## Abstract
Polypropylene oxide having unsaturated end groups is prepared by polymerizing alkylene oxide in the presence of a complex catalyst prepared by reacting an organoaluminum compound with a porphyrin compound and an active hydrogen containing compound and converting at least one hydroxyl end groups into an unsaturated end group s , the prepared polymer having a narrow distribution of molecular weight.
