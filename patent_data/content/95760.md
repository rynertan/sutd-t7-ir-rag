# PISTON STROKE RESPONSIVE VORTEX FLOW SHOCK ABSORBER

## Abstract
A vortex flow hydraulic shock absorber for damping rela tive displacement of two components comprising a piston pro vided with a fluid passage therethrough including a pair of vor tex chambers formed in a movable valve body disposed be tween a pair of resilient annular discs in a valve chamber in the piston. The valve body moves against the force of the resilient annular discs in response to an increase in the pressure differ ence of the working fluid on opposite sides of the piston to po sitions in which the fluid is permitted be bypass one or both of the vortex chambers as it traverses the piston, thereby varying the damping force of the shock absorber.
