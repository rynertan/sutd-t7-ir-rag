# FEED AND RECOVERY SYSTEM FOR AN ELECTROSTATIC POWDER SPRAY APPARATUS

## Abstract
A powder feed and overspray recovery system for an electrostatic powder spray apparatus is disclosed. The feed and overspray recovery system includes a hopper, providing a fluidised bed of powder material. Powder from the fluidised bed is pulled by a pump through a draft tube located in the hopper and directed to one or more electrosta tic spray guns. Overspray material is collected and directed by a second pump directly into the hopper without utilising a sieve to remove impurities from the overspray. The draft tube is preferably a two piece construction with a main body having a fine filter fitting into an extension tube. The extension tube includes a second coarser filter. Should the draft tube become clogged, it can be easily separated from the pump and replaced with a clean draft tube. The extension is separable from the main body to provide a means to easily clean the filters.
