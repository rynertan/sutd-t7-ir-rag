## Description
Ornamental transfers and indicia presenting heat activated decoratives are well known and are typically applied to cloth and other substrates, particularly clothing. These decoratives, particularly heat activated decoratives, are used to provide numbers on sports jerseys, names on shirts and company logos on uniforms. There are several types of heat activated decoratives. Many decoratives include a hot melt adhesive as a layer which is bonded to the cloth surface. The upper layer can be made from a variety of different materials. These are applied to a substrate by heat, pressure and time sufficient to melt the hot melt adhesive layer and permit penetration of the melted adhesive into the surface of the garment. Other decoratives are formed from thermosetting resins which are cured as they are applied to the substrate. In most applications, these decoratives do not need to be removed by solvent or heat. Therefore, thermoset decoratives are quite acceptable. Further in most applications the decoratives neeed only withstand temperatures up to about 140 F 60 C . These are the temperatures typically encountered in home dryers. Known decoratives generally hold up well when subjected to such temperatures as well as the alkaline condition of a normal washing. Prior art decoratives which can withstand the condition of home laundries are never suitable for application onto rental uniforms. Rental uniforms are washed in industrial laundry facilities or hospital laundry facilities. Industrial and hospital laundry facilities use high temperature dryers wherein the ambient temperature of the interior of the dryer reaches at least about 300 400 F 149 204 C and the wall of the dryer reaches about 500 F 260 C Commercial laundries also use extremely alkaline water which is heated to about 200 to about 212 F 93 to about 100 C Further, any indicia on a rental uniform must be removable or else that uniform is relegated to permanent use. For example, if a uniform is permanently marked with Bill it is relegated for permanent use by someone named Bill. This would require a prohibitive amount of inventory. Because of the extreme conditions which a garment is subjected to in an industrial laundry and because the indicia or transfer must be removable, uniform rental companies have resorted to embroidered patches to provide names and other logos for rental uniforms. The embroidered patches are sewn onto the garment or may be heat sealed using a hot melt adhesive. The outer surface of the patch of course is cloth that can withstand the high temperature of the dryer even the drum wall. The embroidered patch can be removed from the garment by either cutting the stitches or dissolving the hot melt adhesive in an appropriate solvent. Embroidered patches are attractive but are stiff and can cause discomfort to the wearer of the garment. Further, embroidered patches are substantially more expensive than laminated, heat activated decoratives. Heat activated decoratives and transfers commonly used in non commercial applications are not removable or cannot withstand the high temperatures of a commercial laundry or the high alkalinity of the commercial laundry. Many such heat activated transfers upon striking the drum of the dryer will partially melt and smear onto adjacent garments. Some transfers are dissolved by the activity of either the alkaline washing or of a dry cleaning fluid. Transfers with a polyvinyl chloride thermoplastic layer when subjected to a solvent will dissolve and migrate into the cloth itself thus permanently marring the garment. Such a transfer is disclosed by Liebe, Jr. U.S. Patent 3,660,212. Liebe discloses a heat activated transfer formed from a polyvinyl chloride lower layer and a surface layer of a cross linked polyvinyl chloride plastisol. The plastisol is highly pigmented and acts as an ink. This decorative transfer cannot be removed and cannot withstand the high temperatures of a commercial dryer. Another decorative is disclosed in Mahn U.S. Patent 4,390,387. This patent discloses a flocked decorative with a lower thermoplastic layer with an upper flock layer bonded to a thermoset layer. But the thermoplastic layer cannot withstand the high temperatures of a commercial dryer. Further, the thermoset layer is an acrylic and cannot withstand the strong alkaline condition of a commercial laundry. A heat activated decorative to be useful on clothing subjected to industrial or hospital laundries must be capable of withstanding washing under highly alkaline conditions, for example, with pH s of 10 or 11 and even higher, and must be capable of withstanding extremely high temperatures encountered in dryers. Industrial and hospital laundry facilities typically dry clothing at temperatures of 400 F 204 C with the surface of the drum reaching 500 F 260 C . A decorative transfer in accordance with one aspect of the invention comprises a lower layer adapted to be thermoplastically adhered to a cloth substrate, an upper indicia bearing layer overlying and bonded to the lower layer, the lower layer comprising a thermoplastic adhesive composition characterised in that the upper layer comprises a thermoset film containing the indicia, in that the upper layer has a film thickness effective to prevent separation of the thermoplastic layer from the cloth during laundering at a temperature of 200 F 93 C or above, in that the layers are substantially non hydrolyzable by an aqueous washing solution having a pH of at least 10, in that the thickness of the upper layer is between 25 microns 25 x 10 ⁶ m and 4 mils 1 x 10 ⁴ m and in that the thermoplastic adhesive has a melting point of at least 350oF 176 C . Such a transfer can withstand the high pH as well as the high temperatures of commercial laundry facilities and can further be removed with an appropriate solvent without marring the garment. The film preferably carries a thermoset ink. The decorative which can withstand harsh conditions found in industrial laundries discussed above is a two component system. The two component system includes an upper layer or film of a non hydrolyzable thermoset film bearing indicia and preferably a polymeric ink, A thermoset plastic is a resin which in its final state is substantially infusible and insoluble. Thermosetting resins, often liquids at some state in their manufacture or process, are cured by heat, catalysis or other chemical means. After being fully cured thermosets cannot be resoftened by heat. Thermosets include those plastics which are normally thermoplastic but which are made thermosetting by means of cross linking with other materials such as cross linked polyolefins. Thermosets do not include plastisols which are a suspension of finely divided vinyl chloride polymer or copolymer in a liquid plasticizer which dissolves the resin when heated. Plastisols by some definitions are considered to be thermosetting in that they harden when heated. However, these compounds remain thermoplastic once solidified and accordingly are not included within the term thermoset. The upper layer is a film of a non hydrolyzable thermoset resin containing indicia. It must be able to withstand a high temperature laundering. Specifically, it must not be hydrolyzed by aqueous alkaline solutions having a pH of about 10 and more preferably 11 at temperatures ranging from about 200 to about 212 F 93 to 100 C for 30 to 45 minutes. Hydrolysis specifically refers to a chemical reaction in which water reacts with another substance to form one or more new substances. Generally polymers which are not hydrolyzable under alkaline conditions are thermoset polymides, thermoset polyurethanes, thermoset polyolefins, thermoset polyepoxides, and thermoset polyesters. Other polymers, of course, can be formulated so that they are non hydrolyzable at high pHs by controlling the cross linking. To determine if a polymeric ink is substantially not hydrolyzed by an aqueous solution having a pH of at least about 10, a film of the polymeric ink is added to an aqueous solution having a pH of at least about 10 and agitated for 10 minutes at room temperature. If the solution is visibly discolored, the polymeric ink is hydrolyzable and unsuitable for use in the present invention. The upper layer also is characterised in that it is an ink. In accordance with another aspect of the invention a decorative transfer comprises a lower layer adapted to be thermoplastically adhered to a cloth substrate, an uppermost layer completely covering the lower layer, the lower layer comprising a thermoplastic characterised in that the uppermost layer comprises a clear cured thermoset resin film, in that the uppermost layer has a film thickness effective to prevent separation of the thermoplastic layer from the cloth during laundering at a temperature of 200 F 93 C or above, in that the thermoset resin comprises a resin which is substantially not hydrolyzed by an aqueous solution having a pH of 10, in that a polymeric ink is printed onto the lower layer to provide indicia, the uppermost layer also covering the polymeric ink, in that the thickness of the uppermost layer is between 25 microns 25 x 10 ⁶m and 4 mils 1 x 10 ⁴m and in that the thermoplastic has a melting point of at least 350 F 176 C . Ink as used herein refers to a resin including a sufficient concentration of pigment and a carrier to provide a stable dispersion of pigment and in an amount effective to provide a desired colour. Suitable pigments and carriers are well known to those of ordinary skill. in the art. Typically a carrier would be clay or an amorphous polymer and the pigment will vary depending on the color of the ink. Further, the thermoset non hydrolyzable ink should not decompose at tempertures below 500 F 260 C . In high temperature industrial laundry facilities the drying activity will frequently subject the upper surface momentarily to temperatures of about 500 F 260 C . Therefore it is important that the polymer not decompose at these temperatures. As stated there are many different types of polymers which would be suitable for use in the present invention. One particular polymer particularly useful as a thermoset non hydrolyzable ink is a moisture cured polyurethane ink. The moisture cured polyurethanes are isocyanate terminated polymers. Curing takes place by the reaction of free isocyanate with atmospheric moisture. Isocyanate terminated polymers can be prepared by the reaction of polyethers or polyesters with di isocyanate or the reaction of diols, triols, and tetraols with di isocyanate. With increasing cross linking density these polymers provide better chemical and solvent resistance of the cured film while decreasing flexibility. Accordingly, a balance of chemical and solvent resistance with flexibility is desired but is simply a matter of preference. These moisture cure polyurethanes are particularly suitable because they are not affected by aqueous solutions having a pH of 12 and are not affected by water when immersed at 25 C for 24 hours. Specific moisture cure polyurethane inks useful in the present invention are presented in the following examples. A white ink suitable for use in the present invention is prepared by simply mixing the following components A red ink was formulated from the following components A black ink was formulated from the following components A blue ink was formulated from the following components In the above examples the polyurethane catalyst is simply a moisture cure polyurethane with a high proportion of reactive isocyanate groups. The pigmented polyurethane is also a moisture cure polyurethane with a lower relative amount of the isocyanates. The lower thermoplastic layer is a thermoplastic polymer which does not flow at less than about 350 F 175 C and preferably 400 F 204 C . Further the thermoplastic is suitably one which can be easily removed from a garment either by heat or solvent. Suitable solvent removable thermoplastics include polyesters, polyamides, polyurethanes and polyethers. High melt polyurethanes are preferred and can be removed with dimethylformamide as well as cyclohexanol. Polymers such as polyvinyl chloride are not easily removed by solvent since they tend to totally dissolve in the solvent and sink into the garment permanently marring the garment. On particularly suitable adhesive is a polyurethane thermoplastic made by the K L Quinn company in Malten, MA product PS 27. This product has a Shore A hardness of 85 90, a Shore D hardness of 35 40, and a melting temperature of 400 420 F 204 215 C . The thermoplastic layer must be compatible with the thermoset layer so separating or delamination does not occur upon application. Therefore it may be preferable to employ the same class of polymer for the thermoplastic and thermoset layers. Preferably when the upper layer is a thermoset polyurethane ink the lower thermoplastic layer should be a high melt polyurethane thermoplastic adhesive. The thermoset ink layer must be thick enough to protect the thermoplastic layer from the heat of the dryer. To protect a thermoplastic layer having a melting or flowing point of 400 F 204 C , the thermoset layer is preferably at least 25 microns 25 x ,10 6m thick and more preferably at least about 40 microns 40 x 10 ⁶ m . This will protect a decorative which is subjected to an industrial dryer. In other words, when the upper thermoset ink layer contacts or rests on a surface which is about 500 F 260 C for 1 2 seconds the thermoplastic layer will not flow or melt. This presumes that the decorative is not pressed against the heated surface but simply rests on the heated surface. One preferred embodiment comprises an upper exposed layer of a thermoset polyurethane moisture cure ink having a film thickness of at least about 40 microns 40 x 10 ⁶ m to 4 mils 1 x 10 ⁴ m . The lower layer is a thermoplastic polyurethane having a melting point of at least about 400 F 204 C and being at least about 2 mils thick 2 x 10 ⁴ m . The thermoset ink provides the indicia and covers the lower thermoplastic layer so that there is little or no exposed surface of the thermoplastic layer once applied to a garment. There is no need for an upper protective layer since heat can be applied directly to the thermoset ink to mel the lower thermoplastic layer and adhere it to a cloth substrate.. This decorative can be transferred to a cloth articles by application of 385 F 195 C for 4 seconds with a minimum pressure of about 4 psi 3 x 10⁴ N m² . In accordance with a still further aspect of the invention a decorative transfer comprises a lower layer adapted to be thermoplastically adhered to a cloth substrate, an upper indicia bearing layer overlying and bonded to the lower layer, the lower layer comprising a thermoplastic adhesive composition characterised in that the upper layer comprises a thermoset film containing the indicia, in that the upper layer has a film thickness effective to prevent separation of the thermoplastic layer from the cloth during laundering at a temperature of 200 F 93 C or above, in that the layers are substantially non hydrolyzable by an aqueous washing solution having a pH of at least 10, in that the thermoplastic adhesive composition is a high melt polyurethane and in that the thermoset film is a thermoset polyurethane. The invention will now be further described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a perspective view partially broken away of a laminate in accordance with the present invention Fig. 1a is a perspective view partially broken away of a modification of the embodiment shown in Fig. 1 Fig. 1b is a perspective view of a modification of the embodiment shown in Figure 1 Fig. 1c is a perspective view of an alternate embodiment of the invention shown in Fig. 1 Fig. 2 is a perspective view partially broken away of an alternate embodiment of the present invention Fig. 3 is a perspective view partially broken away of an alternate embodiment of the present invention and Fig. 4 is a perspective view partially broken away of a decorative according to the present invention having indicia which is a machine readable bar code. With reference to Fig. 1, there is shown a three layer laminate. This laminate includes an upper layer 11 which is a continuous film of a thermoset ink, a second layer 12 which is a clear thermoplastic adhesive layer and a lowest layer 13 which is a removable release coated sheet. To manufacture this laminate the thermoplastic layer 12 is extruded onto the release coated sheet 13. The upper thermoset ink layer is then roll coated onto the thermoplastic layer 12. Prior to application to a substrate the lower release coated layer 13 is simply pulled from the thermoplastic layer 12. The laminate is applied to a garment with thermoplastic layer 12 facing the garment. Heat and pressure are applied directly to the thermoset layer 11. As shown in Fig. 1a, the two component system can be further modified by printing additional layers of thermoset ink onto the upper continuous layer 11. As shown in Fig. 1a there is a lower layer 12 of thermoplastic adhesive. The upper layer is a continuous layer 11 of a white thermoset ink as disclosed in Example 1. Once cured a second layer of red thermoset ink 14 as disclosed in Example 2 is printed or screened onto layer 11. Layer 14 is allowed to air cure and the laminate is applied to a cloth substrate by simply placing layer 12 upon the cloth substrate and applying heat and pressure against the upper layers I4 and 11. The heat transfers through the upper layers to thermoplastic layer 12 causing it to melt and permanently adhere to the garment without feathering. An alternate method of providing indicia is shown in Figure 1b. Figure 1b is a modification of the embodiment of Figure 1. In this embodiment the solid laminated sheet shown in Figure 1 is simply cut using a water knife or other suitable means to form the shape of indicia such as letters or logos. Fig. 1c shows an alternate embodiment providing indicia. The decorative shown in Fig. 1c includes release sheet 13 coated with extruded thermoplastic layer 12 and roll coated with upper layer 11 of a thermoset ink. The uppermost layer 11 is a 100 micron thick film of a white thermoset polyurethane ink of the formulation of Example 1. This is again simply roll coated onto layer 12 and allowed to dry and set. Once set layer 12 is printed with additional indicia. As shown in Fig. 1c, printed onto layer 11 is a black border 17 which is approximately 70 µm thick formed from the coating composition of Example 3. Within the black border area and again printed on layer 11 is a blue diamond 18 again screen printed onto layer 11. The blue diamond 18 is a thermoset polyurethane ink made in accordance with the formula disclosed in Example 4 and provided in a film thickness of about 90 µm . Finally in the center of the blue diamond 18 is indicia 19. The indicia is provided by a 70 µm thick coating of a red thermoset polyurethane ink having the formula disclosed in Example 5. Again this is screen printed onto the white layer 11. If need be butylcelluloseacetate can be used to thin the thermoset ink to obtain a desired viscosity. Figure 2 shows a substantially different method of providing a decorative heat activated transfer. In this application the decorative is provided on a release sheet 22 preferably formed from polyethyleneterepthalate having a very high melting point. The polyethyleneterepthalate has a silicone coating 23 which permits removal of the decorative from the release sheet. Screened onto the silicone layer 23 is a thermoset polymer ink layer 24 which is reversed printed showing indicia. This is allowed to air cure. Above this cured thermoset layer 24 is a thermoplastic layer 25 which is a high melt thermoplastic adhesive. The high melt thermoplastic adhesive is screen printed over the ink layer 24 from a solution of the thermoplastic dissolved in an appropriate solvent such as cyclohexanol. This is screened onto the indicia 24 and the cyclohexanol is allowed to evaporate providing a thermoplastic layer only over the indicia. This is applied to a cloth substrate by pressing the thermoplastic layer 25 against the cloth substrate and applying heat from above the polyethyleneterepthalate layer 22. Heat migrates through the polyethyleneterepthalate through the silicone and the thermoset layer 24 to the thermoplastic layer 25 causing it to melt and migrate into the cloth. Once cooled this provides a good bond for the indicia. Since the polyethyleneterepthalate is coated with a silicone layer it can be separated from the thermoset layer 24 by simply pulling it away from the thermoset layer 24 once the thermoplastic layer is adhered to the cloth. The embodiment shown in Fig. 3 includes a lower layer 27 which is an extruded high melt polyurethane thermoplastic adhesive. Printed on the thermoplastic adhesive 27 is indicia 28 provided by a polymeric ink. The polymeric ink useful in this embodiment is not critical. The indicia 28 is then coated with a clear layer of a thermoset polymer preferably a thermoset polyurethane. This clear layer 29 protects the indicia from the harsh action of the washing solution. The decorative described in the preceding examples are not effected by a dry cleaning fluid and have an indefinite shelf life. The decoratives shown in Figs. 1, 1a, 1b, 1c and 3 and Fig. 4 described later are all applied without the aid of a protective outer covering. Therefore the decorative can be viewed during application. The heat is applied directly to the upper thermoset layer. This provides for easier application with more accurate location of the decoratives. A further advantage of the present invention is that a hot iron can be directly applied to the decorative without effecting the decorative Thus, a garment can be easily ironed. Since the upper layer is cross linked when the decorative is manufactured, these decoratives are also extremely stable and have an indefinite shelf life. Any of the indicia as shown in Figs. 1 3 can be easily removed by activity of a solvent or by application of heat. Because the lower layer is a thermoplastic it can be reheated to soften the thermoplastic layer and the decorative can be removed. Preferably a heated blade having a temperature high enough to melt the thermoplastic layer but not so hot as to scorch the cloth layer is used to remove the decorative. More preferably the decorative and cloth are soaked in an appropriate solvent which will soften the thermoplastic layer and allow the thermoset and thermoplastic layer to simply be pulled off. Typically polyesters can be removed with methylenechloride. Polyamides are removable using chloroform. Polyurethanes can be removed by soaking the decorative in either dimethylformamide or cyclohexanol. Likewise polyethers can be removed by dimethylformamide. This high melt thermoplastic can be removed by these solvents without causing the thermoplastic to migrate into the cloth. The indicia accordingly can be thermoplastically adhered to a cloth substrate such as a garment, for example, a shirt. These can be washed under highly alkaline conditions wherein the pH is at least 10 or 11, and dried in industrial dryers and ironed, at least 50 times. The thermoplastic layer is protected from the momentary contacts with the drum surface of the dryer by the thermoset layer. This prevents the decorative from moving and coming off the garment in the dryer. The thermoset layer is not effected by the high temperature of the dryer. Further, the thermoplastic layer permits the entire decorative to be removed from a garment with a solvent. Thus, the garment is only temporarily marked with the decorative. This provides a unique method of marking garments used as rental uniforms and the like. A unique method of sorting garments for a uniform rental company is therefore provided. As shown in Figure 4 a decorative can be provided with a lower layer of high temperature, thermoplastic adhesive and an upper layer of a thermosetting ink wherein the indicia provided by the thermoset ink establishes a bar code. This is thermoplastically adhered to the surface of a garment. As shown in Fig. 4 the upper layer includes a solid background 11 of a white thermoset ink made according to Example 1 covering a thermoplastic layer 12. An uppermost ink layer in the form of a parallel bars 31 providing a machine readable bar code is printed onto layer 11 and provides a means to code each garment. The bar code is stored in a computer and is assigned a particular meaning. According to the system, an article of clothing would have a decorative as shown in Fig. 4 including a bar code thermoplastically adhered to the article of clothing. Normal laundering of the article would not cause the bar code to be removed. Thus, when the uniform rental company rented a garment marked with such a decorative it could be laundered and subsequently sorted solely by means of the bar code. The bar code with its computer assigned meaning could indicate the company renting the uniform and the individual using the uniform and any additional information necessary to get the garment to its assigned location. Since the decorative shown in article 4 is removable by solvent and or heat, the bar code indicia could be removed when that article of clothing was no longer being rented by the same company or was no longer being used by the same individual. Subsequently a new bar code could be provided which would be coded to indicate a different individual. Alternately, since bar codes are machine readable and their meaning is established in a computer, the old bar codes could be left on the article and simply have that bar code assigned a different meaning. Thus, the need to remove the bar code would be eliminated.
