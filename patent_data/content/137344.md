# SINGLE CABLE OPTICAL FIBRE SIGNALING SYSTEM SINGLE CABLE OPTICAL FIBRE SIGNALING SYSTEM

## Abstract
A single optical fibre cable signaling system is provided between a central station and a remote location wherein a shutter element 30 is movable between first and second positions at the remote location in response to e.g. a change in a measured variable. The shutter element 30 and the interior of a housing 36,38,40,42,60 surrounding the end of the cable 14 have cooperating light absorbing and light reflecting surfaces 62 70 which are effective in one position of the shutter element to absorb unmodulated light transmit ted from a source of the central station over the cable to the remote location and prevent the same from being transmit ted back over the cable and are effective in the other position of the shutter element to reflect unmodulated light transmit ted to the remote location back over the cable to the central station.
