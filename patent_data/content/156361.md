# Device for clamping end portion of optical fiber.

## Abstract
A device K for clamping an end portion of an optical fiber 10 , including a cylindrical sleeve 20 formed with an axially extending aperture 25 for receiving the end portion of the optical fiber 10 and at least one slit 21 extending both radially from its outer side face to the aperture 25 and axially through the sleeve 20 along a plane containing an axis of the sleeve 20 and an adaptor 30 . The outer side face of the sleeve 20 is at least partly tapered into a tapered outer side face 26 and the adaptor 30 is formed with a tapered bore 35 corresponding, in shape, to the tapered outer side face 26 .
