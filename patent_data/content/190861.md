# MARINE SEISMIC VIBRATOR

## Abstract
The invention relates to a marine seismic vibrator which differs from known vibrators in being adapted to use seawater as a hydraulic liquid for generating the seismic vibrations. Preferably the seawater is used to reciprocate a piston and cylinder arrangement in a vibration generating mechanism, preferably via a hydraulic servo valve which may be controlled by an electrically operated pilot valve. Two embodiments of vibrator are described, one of modified conventional form and the other of completely novel con struction. It is to be understood that the invention is applicable to any conventional marine seismic vibrator which can be modified to use seawater as its operating fluid.
