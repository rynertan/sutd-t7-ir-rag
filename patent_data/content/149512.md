# LENS GRINDING APPARATUS

## Abstract
An improved lens grinding apparatus of the type including a grinding wheel 5 , a wheel shaft 2 for mounting the grinding wheel 1 and two lens shafts 6 adapted to rotatably clamp lens blank 5 therebetween. The apparatus further includes a writing device 30 for scribing a band of magnetized zone 31 on the magnetic sheet 13 by means of a writing magnet 26 on the free end of the first arm 23 , a reading device 48 for reading the contour line 32 of the magnetized zone 31 by means of hole elements 44, 45 on the second arm 41 and a center distance changing device 47 for changing the center distance between the wheel shaft 2 and the lens shafts 6 in response to changing of the configuration of the contour line 32 . These devices 30, 48, 47 are operatively associated with one another and opera tions of each of them are controlled by a control system. The magnetic sheet 13 is first magnetized to first polarity by the demagnetizing magnet 28 of the third arm and the magne tized zone 31 is then magnetized to a second polarity by a writing magnet 26 on the first arm 23 which is located in alignment with the follower roller 25 adapted to contact with the V shaped groove 12 of a lens frame 11 . The center distance changing device 47 includes a moving block which is operatively connected to the lens shafts 6 .
