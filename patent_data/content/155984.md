# Automatic packaging system.

## Abstract
An automatic packaging system comprising a container fabricating mechanism 10 for forming a tubular structure from laminated paper 8 capable of heat sealing, marking folding guidelines for forming rectangular prism shaped con tainers 1 , cutting individual pouched containers 1 from the tubular structure, and shaping one end of each pouched con tainer 1 , and a packaging mechanism 11 for filling the shaped containers 1 with a filling material and sealing the openings of the containers 1 . The container fabricating mechanism 10 includes a rotating mandrel mechanism 25 formed of a plurality of radially arranged pairs of forming plates 27 to receive the cut pouched containers 1 . The packaging mechanism 11 includes an endless conveyor mechanism 35 for feeding the containers processed by the container fabricating mechanism 10 , and a deflating mechanism 40 for removing air from the top inside spaces of the containers 1 filled with the filling material, a lug folding heat sealing mechanism 37 for heat sealing the openings of the containers 1 immediately after deflation and then folding and heat sealing the heat sealed portions flat.
