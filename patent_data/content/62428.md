# Process for production of methylamines.

## Abstract
In the catalytic preparation of methylamines from metha nol or dimethyl ether and ammonia using a silica alumina cata lyst, catalyst coking and byproduct formation are reduced and reaction speed and catalyst thermal stability are enhanced when a catalyst containing a high level of alumina is used.
