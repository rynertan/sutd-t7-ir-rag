# Aqueous alkaline paint stripping compositions.

## Abstract
Alkaline compositions useful to form aqueous paint stripping solutions are disclose which comprise mixtures of an alkali metal hydroxide, a polyoxyalkylene polyamine accelerator and, optionally, a glycol or glycol ether accelera tor. The polyamine accelerator has the formula R₁ R₂ NXN R₁ R₂ wherein R₁ and R₂ are selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, lower alkyl and CH₂CH Y O
