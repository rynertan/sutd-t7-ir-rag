# Refractive index responsive light signal system.

## Abstract
A device for producing a light signal corresponding to the refractive index of a fluid medium comprises an elongated light conducting body consisting of an input section 51 and an output section 52 connected to each other by an intermediate curved section 53 adapt ed for immersion in said fluid. This curved section is provided with a plurality of curvatures arranged succes sively and bent alternately in opposite directions, whereby light passing by refraction into said fluid undergoes a notably greater variation, as a function of the refractive index of said fluid medium, than can be obtained with a curved section bent in a simple direction. A light signal is thus provided with a high sensitivity. The complex curved, preferably Î© shaped section can be enclosed in an envelope 54 composed in part of filter material.
