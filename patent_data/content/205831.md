## Description
Specification Axial plunger Pump with Double endface Oil distribution, This invention is related to axial plunger pump.Axial plunger pump is one of fairly ideal hydraulic pumps for high pressure and high speed applications. Various closed passage type axial plunger pumps used today have in common the hydraulic oil to be taken into cylinder chamber from one end of plunger, the reciprocating movement of plunger compresses low pressure oil in the chamber1 changes oil pressure from low to high at outlet. The performance features and high speed running of this kind of pumps are often affected by plunger heating and heat caused by friction between individual components, wear resulted from heating limits service life of the pump.In view of this, Northeast Heavy Machine Institute published a research report on axial plunger pump with double endface oil distribution in 1984. In the report it was proposed that original one intake of oil into chamber from a straight oil distributing plate be replaced with two intakes of oil into chamber from one straight oil distributing plate and another swashplate variable flow head . The scheme of having two intakes of oil not only increases the amount of oil entering chamber, but also features a self cooling effect on plunger and slide shoe due to the fact that oil flows into chamber from swashplate through ports in plunger and slide shoe.At the same time this oil flows through friction pairs, functions as a cooling and lubricating oil for various friction pairs This cooling and lubricating effect significantly improves the situation of heat and wear of parts and components, such as plunger, chamber, various friction pairs etc., as a result, greatly enhances the durability of iise of the pump, makes plunger pump more capable to run under higher pressure and higher speed. Present invention integrates the principle of double endface oil distribution together with such piston pump design as swashplate pump, through shaft pump etc. By cutting holes, slots, notches on pump body, casing, variable flow casing to induce an oil flow path, a new type axial plunger pump with extremely easy intake of oil from both ends of a straight oil distributing plate and a swashplate is formed.Experimental running shows that this pump produces less heat, decreases oil temperature, lowers the pump casing temperature by about 200C in comparison with previous plunger pumps, improves lubrication, makes less noise, decreases noise level by 5 dB, reduces wear greatly, prolongs service life by more than 10 times.In short, this pump shows good technical features, and by eliminating return pipe for leaked oil in construction, its installation and use become more convenient, thus a significant economical benifit can be obtained.Present invention includes two parts a main part which consists of pump body, casing, driving shaft, cylinder block, plunger slide shoe, straight oil distributing plate, and a variable flow mechanism which consists of, variable flow casing, swashplate variable flow head , variable flow part wherein the chamber which consists of oil distributing port on straight oil distributin gplate, intake port on swashplate, holes in slide shoe and plunger, and plunger hole in cylinder block, forms a double endface oil distribution system, characterized in that one or several small ports are machined on swashplate to form a ring shaped port in an area less than one half of a ring so that hydraulic oil from this port can enter into big holes in slide shoe and plunger.In order to obtain Ã…a free flow of oil, the diameter of plunger hole should be made as large as allowed for maintaining adequate strength. Hole in slide shoe is larger than hole in plunger so that oil flow is kept free when these tow parts are oblique to each other. The endface of slide shoe runs coordinately with swashplate as a sealing ring, one half of sum of inner and outer diameters of said sealing ring i.e. endface is equal or approximate to plunger diameter, thus in addition to ensured sealing feature, running wear of slide shoe and seashplate is also reduced. Hydraulic oil flows from a branch passage of the intake passage in pump body through slots and notches in casing, variable flow casing, reaches the other side of swashplate.This oil passage together with the original oil passage composed of intake passage and straight oil distributing plate realise double endface oil entry from,straight oil distributing plate and swashplate. When cylinder rotates with driving shaft, plunger makes a straight reciprocating movement in the cylinder, when plunger extends out, that is, to suck oil, hydraulic oil enters into cylinder chamber from two ports, i.e.from intake port of straight oil distributing plate on one hand and intake port of swashplate, hole in slide shoe.and plunger hole on the other hand, that is, hydraulic oil is sucked from both ends of the plunger simultaneously. To press the oil swashplate closes the bottom hole of slide shoe, low pressure oil port of straight oil distributing plate is blocked from cylinder outlet.As cylinder rotates, plunger is being pushed in with oil pressure increasing, when the pressure becomes higher than outlet pressure, high pressure oil port of straight oil distributing plate is communicated with outlet of cylinder block, oil is pressed out, thus the objective of deliver high pressurized liquid is achieved.Position of intake port of swashplate is preferable at a circle with a radius equal to one half of sum of the long and short axes of ellipse trajectory along which slide shoe runs on swashplate. Both ends of intake ports of swashplate can be appended with noise absorbing slots.The sealing ring at the endface of slide shoe may consists of one or several parts. A half ring shaped hole connected with intake port can be cut in pump body, said hole is preferably formed by casting. One or several small ports for oil passage can be cut in casing, variable flow casing, the total flow area of these ports is approximate to or large than flow area of branch passage. The intake passage of swashplate may also be set at any position on casing or variable flow casing, if intake port is cut in casing, oil enters into chamber intake port of casing with one part of oil passing through notches in casing, slots in pump body, oil distributing port of straight oil distributing plate and another part of oil passing through slots in casing and variable flow casing, oil distributing port of swashplate, hole in slide shoe, plunger hole if intake port is cUt in variable flow casing, oil enters into chamber from intake port with one part of oil passing through slots in variable flow casing, oil distributing port of swashplate and another part of oil passing through slots in variable flow casing, slots and notches in casing, slots in pump body, oil distributing port of straight oil distributing plate. If all intake ports of pump body, casing, variable flow casing are put in one and the same oil tank so that oil can enter simultaneously, the objective of distributing oil from said both endfaces can also be realized.From above it can be seen that present invention will greatly improve performance features of plunger pump in developing new series of axial plunger pump and reconstructing existing closed passage type axial plunger pump resulting in significant economic benifits.Description of attached drawings and examples Fig.. 1 General assembly of axial plunger pump with double endface oil distributionFig. 2.

Said ports locate at a circle with radius equal to one half of sum of long and short axes of ellipse trajectory along which slide shoe runs on swashplate, such arrangement results in a maximum contact area between slide shoe and swashplate and minimun wear. At both ends of ports on swashplate are provided noise absorbing slots 22 which reduce noise level by 5 dB. Said ports together with holes 23, 24 in slide shoe and plunger Fig. 5 form an oil intake passage which enables oil coming from both ends of swashplate to enter into the chamber formed by cylinder block5, straight oil distributing plate 3, swashplate 9, plunger 6 and slide shoe 7. Plunger 6 Fig. 5 is a cylindrical body with a ball shaped end, in the center of which is provided a stepped hole 24, it is most preferable that said ball shaped end s neck has a minimum diameter permissible for a maximum slant angle between slide shoe and plunger.In the center of slide shoe there is a hole 23 Fig.5 , diameter of which is larder than diameter of hole 24 of plunger.The endface 25 of slide shoe represents sealing ring, it runs coordinately with swashplate, when one half of sun of its inner and outer diameters is equal or approximate to plunger diameter, the wear between swashplate and sealing ring is minimized.Straight oil distributing plate 3 Fig. 4 has two ring shaped ports 26, 27 which are less than one half of a ring, each consists of two small ports. Port 27 is suck port for low pressure oil while port 26 is delivery port for high pressure oil. These ports are at one and the same circumference. Straight oil distributing plate 3 together with swashplate 9 control the process of sucking and delivering oil of the pump when cylinder block rotates, thus the objective of supplying high proessure liquid is achieved.In present example one of the two oil passages consists of intake port 29 of pump body 2 Fig.3 and oil sucking port 27 of oil distributing plate 3, while the other oil passage consists of branch passage 28 on intake port 29 of pump body Fig. 3 , notches and slots in casing 31 and 32 in Fig.6 , slots in variable flow casing 33 in fig. 7 , oil chamber 11 in Fig. 1 , and holes 23, 24 in slide shoe and plunger Fig. 5 . Brsnch passage 28 of intake port of pump body is a half ring shaped through hole connected with intake port 29 of pump body, said hole is preferably formed by casting. Notch 31 in casing is half circle shaped, which area is equal to or greater than area of half ring port 28 in pump body, when assembled, these two ports should be matched to form a through passage.The slot in casing 32 in fig. 6 is located at a position of big bearing. It may comprise one or several slots, its or their total area of passage is greater than or equal to area of notch 31 in casing.In variable flow casing there is one or several slots 33 in Fig. 7 , the number of which is equal to the number of slots ih casing, said slots are connected with those in casing, the area of slots in variable flow casing should be slightly greater than the area of slots in casing. From Fig. 1 it can be seen that these notches are linked with passage, slots are linked with each other, oil passage is linked with oil chamber, thus present invention eliminates original pipe for leaked oil in plunger pump, makes construction much simpler. From Fig.I it can be seen that big bearing 8 is at oil slot of casing 4, resulting in better lubrication. Moreover, when pump body and casing are made integrated, the performance features and benin it effectiveness of pump are equally good, because the working principle does not change.From above it can be seen that present invention is a new axial plunger pump with such features as self cooling, Plunger 6 Fig. 5 is a cylindrical body with a ball shaped end, in the center of which is provided a stepped hole 24, it is most preferable that said ball shaped end s neck has a minimum diameter permissible for a maximum slant angle between slide shoe and plunger. In the center of slide shoe there is a hole 23 Fig. 5 , diameter of which is larger than diameter of the hole 24 of plunger.The endface 25 of slide shoe represents sealing ring, it runs coordinately with swashplate, when one half of sum of its inner and outer diameters is equal or approximate to plunger diameter, the wear between swashplate and sealing ring is minimized.Straight oil distributing plate 3 Fig. 4 has two ring shaped ports 26, 27 which are less than one half of a ring, each consists of two small ports. Port 27 is suck port for low pressure oil while port 26 is delivery port
