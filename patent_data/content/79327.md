# FLUID TRANSFER ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
A fluid transfer assembly for transferring fluid from a container 84 wherein the container has a neck sealed by a resilient stopper 86 , the stopper having an external project ing portion 88 receiving a conduit 100 . The conduit is integral with a chamber 92 closed to atmosphere by an openable seal 94 . The conduit is closed within the stopper by a frangible wall 104 from which extends into the container an actuating portion 106 . The conduit can be moved transversely so that the actuating portion 106 presses against the resistance of the container to break the frangible wall 104 to open the conduit to the container.
