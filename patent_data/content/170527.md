# Aqueous drilling and packer fluids.

## Abstract
Sulphonated polymers and copolymers are used as thinners in aqueous drilling or packer fluids. The sulphon ated polymer has polydispersity below 2 and has a low solution viscosity. it is generally a copolymer of beta acrylamidoalkane sulphonate or allyl sulphonate or other aliphatic sulphonate with an ethylenically unsaturated car boxylic acid, generally acrylic acid.
