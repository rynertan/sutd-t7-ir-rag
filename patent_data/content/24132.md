# Fluid container.

## Abstract
A container for shipping, storing and mixing at least two fluids has a covered cylindrical outer container for containing a first fluid and a coaxial, smaller diameter inner container for the second fluid. The inner container is closed at the end adjacent the cover of the outer container by a piston and at the opposite end by a removable seal. A plurality of mixing blades are spaced around the inner container and are coupled to a drive plate in the cover of the outer container for rotation therewith. The drive plate has an axial opening for a pusher rod to enter and push the piston down the inner container to expel the second fluid into the first fluid in the outer container, the fluids then being mixed by rotation of the drive plate.
