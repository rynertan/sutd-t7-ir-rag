## Description
The present invention relates to a sectionable lamp holder supporting structure for floodlights.In particular, the present invention relates to a lamp holder supporting structure for floodlights for the lighting of open environments, in dust proof and humidity proof execution and utilizable for any type of lamp.As it is known, floodlights for the lighting of open environments are subjected to particularly severe environmental conditions and, therefore, the lamp holder supporting structure has to guarantee tightness to dusts and humidity as well as the physical resistance even under the most disadvantageous conditions.The most usual cases of use for the floodlights in open environments are lighting of areas intended for sport activities, where floodlights are subjected to atmospherical agents, namely to rain, snow, frost,and they undergo the thermal shock from summer season to winter season lighting of road tunnels where the floodlights are sub jected to the action of environmental humidity, to dripping water as well as to the action of the corrosive agents produced by the exhaust gas of motor vehicles in combination with the environmental humidity lighting of industrial factories, where the floodlights, besides being exposed to the action of the atmospherical agents as described hereinbefore, are subjected to the action of corrosive substances discharged to the atmosphere by the plants of said factories lighting of streets and monuments, where the floodlights, arranged also in proximity of the ground, besides being Cx posed to the atmospherical agents, are also subjected to water and mud sprays and to the action of mechanical impacts. A lamp holder supporting structure, by consequence, must withstand the physical chemical stressed above mentioned and prevent the penetration of dust, moisture, corrosive vapours and gases into the apparatus, which would irreparably lead to an even considerable efficiency loss of the optical appar atus along with a decrease in amount and intensity of the light emitted by the floodlight. The points which promote the penetration of these elements into the apparatus are substantially two the connection between the optical chamber case and the remaining part of the support ing structure and the connection between the cable, which feeds the electric current, and the floodlight. In addition to the foregoing, a lamp holder supporting structure must also withstand the inner heat generated by the lamp and keep in spite of the action of the external agents and of the inner heating, the electric insulation characteristics and a sufficient mechanical resistance. The lamp holder supporting structure has also to permit an easy removal without the use of tools of the lamp holder lamp group even after an operation of a few years, in order to keep low the ordinary maintenance costs. The Applicant has now found that all the above mentioned requirements and functions are fully met by a dust proof and humidity proof sectionable lamp holder supporting structure for floodlights, which consists of a supporting element, a lamp holder, an electric connection means between feed phase and lamp, an optic chamber case and means for fastening said components to one another, characterized in that a the supporting element is equipped, on the side turned to the optic chamber case, with a circumferential groove for receiving a toroidal sealing gasket which acts on said op tic chamber case b the fastening means comprise a plaque fixed to the lamp holder and provided with indents on its ends a disc shaped support,fixed to said supporting element by means of screws and small spacing columns, and equipped, on its outcr edge, with three teeth, olle of which having dimen sions aifferent from the ones of the other two identical teeth two small columns welded to the support, on which the plaque with the lamp holder is fixed by means of screws c the electric connection means between feed phase and lamp includes a sectioning complex consisting of two restrain ing elements, one of which being fixed to one of the two small columns supporting the lamp holder,while the other element is fixed to the optic chamber case, and d the optic chamber case exhibits a shaped hole with res traints suited to engage in the teeth of the lamp holder support. The supporting element has a flat shape, completely closed in the upper part, and on its outer edge it is provided with recesses and projections to facilitate the manual gripping. The lamp holder supporting structure forming the object of the present invention is simple,rugged,reliable, it utilizes a hollow seal gasket and can be installed on any floodlight and with any type of lamp. Furthermore, it is easy to produce and requires a very low maintenance it can be manufactured from commonly availagle and moderately expensive materials and guarantees a Class II isolation according to CEl standards. For a better understanding of the lamp holder supporing structure of the present invention,a detailed descriptiori is given hereinafter making reference to the figures of the t tached drawing, in which fig. 1 is a partially sectional view in side elevation of the lamp holder supporting structure of the present invention, before being connected with the optic chamber case fig. 2 is an exploded perspective view of the lamp holder supporting structure with sectioning element, lamp holder and electric connections according to the invention. With reference to the figures, the lamp holder supporting structure according to the invention includes a support 1 prov ided with a groove for housing a toroidal gasket 2 , which has to guarantee the tightness by acting on the optic chamber case 5 . A support 3 is fixed to support 1 by means of screws 12 and small spacing columns 19 . Columns 19 adjust the distance between support 3 and support 1 in such manner that the tightness provided by the gasket on the optic chamber case will be the best possible. A lamp holder 4 , equipped with a plaque 20 is fixed to support 3 by means of small columns 17 and 18 and by means of screws 13 . One of the two elements of the sectioning complex, for example the male element 6 , is fixed by means of a screw 14 to one of the columns, while the other element, the fem ale element cos , is fixed to the optic chamber case 5 by means of a square element 8 and of screws 15 and 16 both sectioning elements secure the electrical connection with lamp holder 4 and with the feed phase through cables 7 and 10 , respectively after having coupled the whole supporting structure with the optic chamber case and after a proper rotation, the two elements fit together,thereby allowing the electric connection to the lamp. To facilitate such connection, support 3 is equipped with three teeth, two of which being like 11 and one 11 being different, which enter into engagement in corresponding restraints shaped on the hole of the optic chamber case S . The operation of the lamp holder supporting structure com plex can be clearly understood from the preceding description making reference to figures 1 and 2 it is apparent that said complex, resulting from the combination of parts 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9 and 20, is engaged by the teeth of support 3 to case 5 and is locked to it through a proper rotation. Through this last operation, gasket 2 is pressed against the surface of case 5 , thereby providing the desired tightness to the penetration of dust and moisture.
