## Description
HIGH STRENGTH HYDRAULIC CEMENT COMPOSITION BACKGROUND AND FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a hydraulic cement composition. More particulary, the invention relates to a high strength hydraulic cement composition prepared by grinding a granulated blast furnace slag as a main raw material, pozzolanic materials as a sub main raw material and functianal additives such as slaked lime, aluminous sulfate and metal salts of fluorosilicate, and mixing them, without high temperature calcinating. Prior to the present invention, Portland cements were customarily prepared by calcinating a limestone, clay and iron ore at a temperature of 1,5000C to make a clinker, and thereafter grinding and mixing the clinker with a gypsum. But, said method involves consumption ofter times of a considerable amount of energy due to the mining, pretreating, calcinating and grinding of the raw materials, and requires large scaled facilities. Accordingly, various energy saving cements such as slag cements have been suggested, which apply a latent hydraulic properties of the granular slag byproduced from iron works. In general, such slag cements are classified into two kinds one is a granular slag 25 30wt. Portland cement system, and the other is a granular slag 70 85wt. calcium sulfate anhydrate system.The latter case is now standardized as BS 4,248 inEngland, NBN 132 in Belgium, Norme P.15 313 inFrance and DIN 4,210 in Germany. Such standardized slag gypsum system is a supersulfated cement and consists essentially of 80 85wt. of slag, 15 20 wt. of gypsum and 1 3wt. of Portland cement. The chemical and mineral composition of the slaggypsum system compared with an ordinary Portland cement are given in Table 1 below.

The system also contains large amount of SO3 component and little amount of CaO component, consists essentially of a solid solution of C2AS and C2MS2, and has little content of C3A and C3 S which are main raw materials of Portland cements. In this invention, the terms,A,C,S and M means A1203, CaO, SiO2 and MgO, respectively. Generally, the more the amount of Ca OH 2, namely, free lime, the inferior the chemical resistance of a hardened body of the cements because Ca OH 2 is formed inevitably when C3S is hydrated. Moreover, hydration product of C3A, namely, hydrates of the calcium aluminate series, has inferior chemical resistance, particulary sulfate resistance, which causes the chemical resistance, particulary sulfate resistance of the Portland cements to fall. Therefore, the Portland cements may not be applied to a place which contains an abundance of salt or saline component and requires chemicalresistance. But, the above slag gypsum system may be employed as a special cement which requires mainly a chemicalresistance properties, because the system containing little amount of C3A and C3 S components has excellent chemical resistance, particulary salt resistance properties. The glass component corresponding to the composition of a melilite which is a main component of the granular slag not undergoes always a hydration reaction immediately after on contacting with water like C3S, C3A and C2S components of the Portland cement, but undergoes a hydration reaction only in the presence of a strong alkaline solution though in contact with water.Generally, the rate of the hydration reaction is very slow. In the above slag gypsum system, a small quantity of the free lime, which is produced additionally when about 2wt. of the Portland cement contained in the system is hydrated particulary, when the C3 S component of the Portland cement is hydrated , acts as a hydration accelerator, namely, alkaline activator. However, only in the presence of an effective amount of water the alkaline activation of the free lime is generated, because a solubility of the free lime in water is not so high. That is to say, in case that the amount of water is insufficient, it is difficult to effect the alkaline activation of the free lime. In the initial stage of the hardening reaction of the slag gypsum system, a large quantity of ettringite crystal 3CaO.Al203CaS04.32H20 is formed because large quantity of SO3 component is contained in the system. Such ettringite crystal absorbs large quantity of water as a crystal water.Therefore, in case of water being lack, most of water will take part in forming an ettringite, water required for effecting an alkaline activation of the small quantity of the Portland cement with hydration rate very slow will be lack, and consequently the forming of the cementious matrix by the hydration of melilite will be more difficult. As described above, if complete hardening reaction by the hydration is not accomplished, most of the resultant hydrates will exist in the state of bukly, porous and acicular ettringite, and consequently bulk state hardened body will be formed because the matrix wrapping and binding the ettringite is not existing.Therefore, C02 gas in the air attacks the hardened body, and consequently the ettringite will be decomposed later as shown in formula 1 . 0.377 3CaO.A1203.3CaS04.32H20 1.13C02EMI6.1 If the ettringite decomposed as shown in formula 1 , the mechanical strength goes down and the deterioration arise. This phenomenon is called the deterioration by the carbonation. The exemplary disadvantages appeared in the slag gypsum system are enumerated as follows 1 An initial hardening strength develops very slowly, 2 Only underwater or underground the strength develops in a normal curing rate, but in the air the strength develops slowly and the curing may not be executed without taking a necessary step to prevent water dispersion, 3 When exposured on the air, the surface deteration will arise and the mechanical strength will go down, and 4 The hydration rate of the CaO.Al2O3.SiO2.H2O, CaO.SiO H 0 and CaO.A1203.H20 by the melilite which 2 2 2 3 2 b the melilite which is a main component of the slag is very slow, but setting rate, particulary initial setting rate is very rapid rather than Portland cements becauseCaS04.2H20 involving CaS04 is hydrated and the ettringite is formed very rapidly. Consequently, the use of the slag gypsum system is restricted to seawater work, underwater work or underground work, and has limited time for working.That is to say, the slag gypsum system is not an usual cement unlike the Portland cements. OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the invention to provide a novel high strength hydraulic cement having high initial hardening strength, excellent carbonationresistance and lengthened initial setting time. Another object of the present invention is to provide a high strength hydraulic cement which can be used commonly like Portland cements. A further object of the present invention is to provide a high strength hydraulic cement which will solve several disadvantages of the usual slaggypsum system. Other objects and further scope of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description given hereinafter. It should be understood, however, that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating prefered embodiments of the invention, are given by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed description. This invention relates to a high strength hydraulic cement composition having high initial hardening strength, excellent carbonation resistance and lengthened initial setting time, characterized in that comprises 60 85 wt. parts of granulated blast furnace slag, 5.0 15 wt. parts of calcium sulfate anhydrate and or calcium sulfate dihydrate, 6.0 12 wt. parts of pozzolanic materials, 2.0 10 wt.parts of slaked lime, 1.0 6.0 wt. parts of Portland cement or Portland cement clinker, 1.0 6.0 wt.parts of metal salts of fluorosilicates and 0.1 0.8 wt.parts of aluminous sulfate. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The process for producing the high strength cement composition of the present invention comprises grinding and mixing together granulated blast furnace slag, calcium sulfate anhydrate and or calcium sulfate dihydrate, pozzolanic materials, slaked lime, Portland cement or Portland cement clinker and metal salts of fluorosilicates without carrying out a high temperature calcinating to produce fine powder having Blaine value of about 2,500 4,600cm2 g. The granulated blast furnace slag which may be used in the practice of the present invention is that which is by produced in iron works. As calcium sulfate anhydrate and or calcium sulfate dihydrate, may be used purified waste gypsum by produced in fertilizer plants, if necessary, natural gypsum or chemical gypsum.And also as pozzolanic materials, may be used ash clinker or fly ash from steam generating stations, briquet cinders, coal cinders, or calcined aluminous silicate, white clay or earth. The detailed description of the hardening reaction mechanism of the cement according to this invention is as follows. At room temperature and under normal atmospheric pressure, Al2O3 .SiO2 series high reactive pozzolanic materials and Ca OH 2 produce a gel state cementious matrix gel state cementious hydrates of CaO.SiO2.H2O or CaO.Al2O3.H2O series as soon as hydration reaction is occured. The resultant cementious matrix prevents the ettringite from decomposing by CO2 gas because the matrix wraps the surface of the acicular ettringite particles crystallized at early stage of the hydration reaction. Furthermore, the A1203.SiO2 series andCa OH 2 make it possible for calcium sulfate anhydrate added in early stage of the hydration reaction to exist in an ettringite state or a solid solution state comprising both the ettringite and the gel state CaO.Al 203 .H20 while the calcium sulfate anhydrate is not hydrated into calcium sulfate dihydrate. Therefore, the pozzolanic materials and excess amount of Ca OH 2 prevents the problems such as a false setting by the hydration of CaSO4 Calcium sulfate anhydrate and a shortening of the early setting time from arising, and gives a carbonating resistance to the ettringite. However, the effect which results from the additives comprising pozzolanic materials, CaSO4 and excess amount of lime does not solve the problems, for example, such as an adjustment of hydration rate, a prevention of carbonating and a development of strength.In order to solve the problems, it is preferable that hydrate rapidly a glass phasegehelenite, C2AS of the melilite composition which is slag dust to form a matrix comprising cementious materials of CaO.SiO2H2O, CaO.A1203.H2O and CaO.Al203. SiO2.H20 series.Namely, it is preferable to accelerate an alkaline activation of the slag dust. But, in practice, the slag dust remains inactive because the hydration reaction by the alkaline activation of the slag dust is not accerelated, and the decomposition between the slag component and the additives, which is called to bleeding phenomenon, is occured though the hydration reaction by the additives is under way. Therefore, to enhance the alkaline activation and sulfate activation of the slag component, are added about 2.0 5.0wt. of Ca OH 2, about 0.5wt. Na2SiF6 and about 0.2 0.8wt. of aluminous sulfate in addition to about 2.0 3.0wt. of Portland cement. Ca OH 2 described above reacts with CaSO4 and pozzolanic material to form ettringite and cementious materials such as CaO.SiO2.H2O and CaO.A1203.H2O, and Al 2 2 . 203.H20, and to form simultaneously strong alkaline solution which acts also as an alkaline activator.But, if the amount of Ca OH 2 is more than 5.0wt. , there is the possibility that the chemical resistance way deteriorate and efflorescence phenomenon may arise because Ca OH 2 exists in free lime. Na2SiF6 itself is very stable in the air, but solved fast in water to develop alkaline property as followsEMI13.1 CaSiF6 2NaOH H2 2 insoluble alkaline As shown in the reaction formula 2 , insolubleCaSiF6 stable chemically is also precipitated besides developed alkaline property. The precipitated CaSiF6 densifies the structure of the hardened body of the cement according to this invention by existing in colloidal state in the hardened body, and consequently the strength of the hardened body is increased. Accordingly, as the precipitated CaSiF6 prevents the CO2 gas from entering, the characteristics of the alkaline activation and the carbonation resistance become more effective. But, an excess amount of Na2SiF6 causes an efflorescence phenomenon to hardened body of the cement because aqueous salt of alkali is formed.Preferably, the amount of Na2SiF6 is not more than O.5wt. based on the total weight of the cement according to this invention. On the other hand, in the practice of the present invention both MgSiF6 and ZnSiF6 which not cause an efflorescence phenomenon to hardened body of the cement may be employed together with Na2SiF6. The reaction formulas relating to MgSiF6 and ZnSiF6 are as follows EMI14.1 CaSiF6 Mg OH 2 H2O 3 insoluble Mg OH 2 CO2 MgCO3 4 insoluble EMI14.2 CaSiF6 Zn OH 2 H20 5 insoluble insoluble Both MgCO3 and Zn OH 2 produced in the reaction formula 4 and 5 respectively also contribute to a densification of the hardened body structure. The fluorosilicates which can be employed in the practice of the present invention are selected from the group consisting of sodium fluorosilicate Na2SiF6 , magnesium fluorosilicate MgSiF and zine fluorosilicate 6 ZnSiF6 . The mixed salt thereof also employed in this invention. The combined amount of the fluorosilicates employed can vary from 0.5 to 3.0wt. based on the weight of the hydraulic cement, and preferably the ratio of Na2SiF6 MgSiF6 ZnSiF6 is from 1 1 to 1 2 by weight . The aluminous sulfate employed in this invention reacts with Ca OH 2 and accelerates the fromation of a Ettringite rapidly. Therefore, over retardation of setting time due to the addition of a pozzolanic material can be prevented. The amount of the aluminous sulfate ranges from 0.1 to 0.8 wt. based on the weight of the hydraulic cement.An excess of the range causes the over acceleration of the initial setting time, and lower a concreteworkability. The other additives which can be employed in this invention are water receding dispersant for cements such as Melment F 10, and silica sand or silica stone. The prefered amount of the water receding dispersant, and the silica stone or silica sand are 0.1 1.0 wt. , and 0.1 5.0 wt. , respectively. As illustrated above, the early strength is developed due to the acceleration of hydration by the alkaline activation, the carbonation resistance is effected by the addition of pozzolanic materials, excess amount of lime and salts of fluorosilicates, and the adjustment of the setting time and the enhancement of the long term strength can be achieved due to the balanced hydration reaction of the slag, lime, gypsum and pozzolanic materials by the influence of the additives. The developed hydraulic cement of this invention, therefore, may be applied on a large scale like the Portland cements. Also, The hydraulic cement according to the present invention develops the same setting time and initial hardening strength as ordinary Portland cements, and has excellent long term strength, chemical resistance and carbonation resistance compared with existing Portland cements or slag gypsum system. Moreover, though the cement of this invention is subjected to carbonation, the structure of the hardened body of the cement will not be cracked and the mechanical strength will not be deteriorated unconditionally unlike existing slaggypsum system.The reason is that carbonation of the cement is occured after the hydration reaction of the cement is nearly finished and the reinforcement body originated from the resultant hydrates and cementious bonding matrix is already formed. The following table 2 shows that the characters of the cement of this invention are superior to that of the slag gypsum system and ordinary Portland cements.
