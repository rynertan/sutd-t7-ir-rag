As shown in Figure 1, the automatic plating apparatus is so designed that the assembly line is incorporated into a circuit assuming a rectangle in a plan view. In the drawings, the reference numeral 1 denotes the first plating line, 2 the second plating line, 3 and 4 the lateral conveyor lines, 5 and 6 an inlet end and an outlet end respectively of the first line, and 7 and 8 an inlet and an outlet end respectively of the second plating line. The first and second plating lines 1 and 2 are parallel to one another and a pair of rails 9a and 9b for each of the lines extend over the plating tanks. Reference numerals lOa and lOb denote rails for the lateral conveyor lines 3 and 4 respectively. There are located in succession on the first plating line 1, starting from the inlet end 5 towards the outlet end 6, a locationA for the step of supplying the objects to be plated, a tank B for a de greasing step, a water rinse tank C, an activation tank D, a water rinseE and a strike plating tank F while on the second plating line, also from the inlet end 7 to the outlet end 8, a water rinse tank G, a partial plating tank H, an exfoliation tank I, a water rinse tank J, a hot water rinse tank K and a location L for the step of removing objects that have been plated. Support carriages 11 for the objects to be plated are also provided on the rails 9a and 9b so as to be locatable above the plating tanks.Support carriages are also mounted on the lateral carriage 12a of the lateral conveyor line 3 and the lateral carriage 12b of the lateral conveyor line 4 respectively. At the inlet ends 5 and 7 of the first and the second plating lines 1 and 2, a forwarding means 13 is provided to push the support carriages 11 for objects to be plated a positioning means 14 for the support carriage 11 is also provided at the outlet ends 6 and 8 of the first and the second plating lines 1 and 2 respectively. A vacuum device 16 is provided at the inlet end 5 of the first plating line 1 and the outlet end 8 of the second plating line 2 respectively to supply and remove the objects. Referring now to Figures 3 and 4, the vacuum device comprises primarily a carrier 17 in the form of a frame and a tubular member 18 which is suspended from the carrier 17. The carrier 17 is made movable freely by a means not shown on the frame 19 Figure 2 to the right and the left in Figure 3. The tubular member 18 is connected to a suction device 18b by means of a flexible duct 18a at its upper end see Figure 2 supported in the middle by a supporting plate 22 which is attached to rods 21 of pressure cylinders 20 provided on the carriage 17. At its lower end, a suction and injection box 23 is attached.The box 23 is connected to a supply means for pressurised air not shown . At the upper outer circumference of the tubular member is provided a screw 24 to which a support ring 25 is screwed to adjust the lowermost position and which is supported by said supporting plate 22. The support ring 25 adjusts the lowermost position of said box. Pins 27 are provided on a table 26 on which a plurality of strips of objects 15 to be plated, for example a frame for IC leads obtained from a thin metal plate treated for press or etching treatment, are mounted. At the bottom of the box 23 are provided suction holes 28 and through holes 29 to receive said pins 27 and at its side are pins 30 suspended therefrom to determine descending position. As shown in Figure 4, the tubular member 18 will descend by means of the support plate 22 and the support ring 25 in accordance with the degree of the action of the pressure cylinder 20. The box 23 will come in direct contact with the objects 15 to be plated which are placed on the table 26, whereupon the objects 15 to be plated will be sucked towards the suction hole 28 of the box 23 as the tubular member 18 is placed under vacuum. The objectsl5 to be plated will then ascend as suction is applied and move towards the right in Figure 3, The box 23 will be lowered again by the pressure cylinder 20 to introduce the objects 15 into the support carriage 11. The objects 15 to be plated will be easily removed from the bottom of the box 23 by introducing pressurised air to said box 23 at this point, converting the suction hole 28 into an injection hole instead. The support carriage 11 for the objects to be plated will now be described with reference to Figures 5 and 6. The support carriage 11 mainly comprises a carrier base 31 in the form of a frame and a rack base 32 suspended therefrom.The carrier base 31 is provided with a slider 33 engaging at its bottom with the rail 9a and an upstanding rod 35 surrounded by a spring 34 is provided on the upper surface of the carrier base 31. The rack base 32 is suspended and retained within the frame of the carrier base 31 by means of a movable bush 36, a bush plate 37 and suspension rods 38. The rack base 32 will descend vertically under external pressure and ascend to its original position by the resilience of the springs 34 when released of the pressure. The rack base .32 is provided with holders 39 on the cross members of the rack base to align and support objects 15 to be plated and a guide hole 40 for determining the descending position. A pressure means 41 for determining the descending position is provided on the first plating line 1 in order to simultaneously force each of the rack bases 32 on the support carriages 11 and carrying objects 15 to be plated thereon into each of the plating tanks B to F to a predetermined depth. The pressure means 41 comprises, as shown in Figure 2, a pressure cylinder 43 provided on a frame 42, an elongated pressure frame 44 for the rod of the pressure cylinder 43 and pressure rods 45 extending downwardly from the pressure frame 44 at a position directly above each plating tank B to F . The pressure rods 45 are lowered by the pressure frame 44 by means of the pressure cylinder 43 to abut with the upper surface of the respective bush plates 37 for the support carriages 11 to eventually force each rack base 32 downwardly against the force of the respective springs 34. Figures 7 to 9 illustrate the water tank C for rinsing. A holding member 47 is fixed to the pressure frame 44 by means of suspension bars 46, and the holding member 47 is provided with pressure ribs 49 movably attached to the frame base 48. The pressure ribs 49 are non conductive and come in contact with the upper surface of the objects 15 to be plated as they descend. That is, as can be seen in Figure 8, when the pressure frame 44 descends, the pressure rod 45 and the holding member 47 will inevitably descend in correspondence with the movement of the pressure frame 44. The former presses down and positions the rack base 32 with the objects 15 to be plated into the plating tank C, while the latter prevents the objects 15 from falling off from the rack base 32 more precisely, the holder 39 as it presses the upper surface thereof.This description concerning Figures 7 to 9 is not limited only to the water tank C for rinsing but will apply to all of the plating tanks for dip pla ting wherein no electric charge is necessary. Referring to Figures 10 to 14, plating procedures requiring electric charges such as electrolytic de greasing or overall strike plating etc. will be described. A holding member 50 is attached to the lower end of suspension bars 46a provided on the pressure frame 44, and the holding member 50 is provided with weights 53 of conductive material which are inserted in through holes 52 formed in the frame base 51. A lead wire 54 extends over the weights 53. On the other hand, in the strike plating tank F is provided an anode 55.As shown in Figure 11, when the pressure frame 44 is pressed downwardly, the pressure rod 45 and the holding member 50 will be pressed downwardly in accordance with the pressure frame, the former pressing the rack base 32 together with the objects 15 to be plated into the plating tank F, and the latter rendering the lower surfaces of the weights 53 of the holding member 50 to abut with the upper surfaces of the objects 15 to be plated. The electric current is caused to flow in this position to perform the desired electrolysis.In order to allow the weights 53 and the objects 15 to come in secure contact, pins 56 are suspended from the side of the holding member 50, and these pins prevent errors in plan wise positioning by engaging with the guide holes 40 of the rack base 32. The plating processes in the apparatus of Figures 7 to 9 and 10 to 14 are conducted at the same time by lowering the common pressure frame 44. For this purpose, support carriage 11 for the objects 15 needs to move on the rail 9a and stop at an accurately predetermined position. A means to allow exact positioning and the movement of the support carriage 11 is shown in Figure 15 and Figure 16. Figure 15 illustrates the forwarding pressure means 13 which is provided at the inlet end 5 of the first plating line 1. A similar device is provided at the inlet end 7 of the second plating line 2, description thereof being omitted here. The forwarding pressure means 13 comprises pressure cylinders 57 with associated piston rods and a movable plate 58 attached to the ends of the rods, being guided by bars 60.The movable plate 58 is in contact with the end portion 59 of the carrier base 31 of the support carriage 11 for the objects to be plated which is located on the lateral carriage 12b and forces the support carriage 11 from the lateral carriage 12b onto the rail 9a on the first plating line. The length of the carrier base 31 is predetermined to correspond with the extent of the plating process and the length 9 of each plating tank see Figure 1 . Therefore, as a new carriage is forced into the line by means of the said movable plate 58 with each carriage 11 arranged above a respective plating tank B to F , the carriaggproceed to the next process by one pitch, namely by the length X, and the support carriage 11 at the outlet end of the plating line will be forced onto the lateral carriage 12a located there. Thus, the first plating line 1 will be filled with support carriages 11 for the distance of one block X cf Figure 1 , and a positioning means 14 is employed to accurately position each of the carriages with respect to each of the plating tanks B to F , as shown inFigure 16. A pressure cylinder with cushion is employed as the positioning means 14, so that the position will be adjusted minutely by receiving the tip 61 of the carrier base 31 of the first support carriage 11 on line, absorbing the forwarding pressure caused by the pressing and forwarding of the carriage by means of the movable plate 58 and at the same time pushing back all the carriages. Springs, air cushions and the like can be employed as the positioning means 14 instead of the pressure cylinder with cushion as used here. Figures 17 and 18 illustrate the lateral conveyor line 3. As the other lateral conveyor line 4 is substantially the same as the line 3, the description thereof is omitted. The conveyor line 3 is provided with a lateral rail 10a which carries the lateral carriage 12a and a conveyor means 62. The lateral carriage 12a comprises a pair of rails 63 for the support carriage 11 and the ends of a driving chain 64 are attached to the sides thereof. The conveyor means 62 comprise a pressure cylinder 65, a rod with a rack 66, a sprocket 67 co axial with the pinion, a tension sprocket 68 and a guide sprocket 69, and a driving chain 64 is extended about a group of sprockets.The sprocket 67 will rotate by the action of the pressure cylinder 65, to move the chain 64 so that the lateral carriage 12a carrying the support carriage 11 thereon will move from the outlet end 6 of the first plating line 1 to the inlet end 7 of the second plating line and from the outlet end 8 of the second plating line to the inlet end 5 of the first plating line 1.Conversely, in order to position the lateral carriage 12a at the outlet end 6 of the first plating line 1, the rod 66 of the pressure cylinder 65 is shifted from the point Ya to the point Yb of Figure 18 the sprocket 67 co axial with the pinion is rotated clockwise, the driving chain 64 is moved to the right in Figure 18 and the lateral carriage 12a locating at the inlet side 7 of the second plating line 2 is transferred to the left in the drawing, together with the movement of the driving chain 64.Thus, the carriage 12a will be positioned at the inlet side 6 of the first plating line 1. Because of the provision of the forwarding pressure means 13 shown in Figure 15, the support carriage 11 for the objects to be plated will be transferred to the line 2 in the manner described above at the inlet end 7 of the second plating line 2. The partial plating process on the second line 2 will now be described with reference toFigures 19 to 22. Other after treatment such as water rinsing, hot water rinsing and the like other than the partial plating can be performed in a manner similar to that described with respect to the drawings of Figures 7 to 14 and the description of the apparatus therefor is omitted. An aperture 70 for injection is provided on a first mask 71, which is provided on the upper surface of the partial plating tank H. Plating liquid can be injected at will from a nozzle 72 which acts also as an anode refer to Figure 22 .At the upper portion thereof, a pressure body 74 provided at the lower end of a pressure rod 73a of a pressure cylinder 73 is arranged together with a guide rod 73b. The pressure body 74 comprises a case 76 in the form of a band provided with lead wires 75 and a pressure main body 78 provided with a second mask 77 at its lower end. Positioning pins 79 project at the upper surface of the partial plating tank H, refer to Figure 22 while a positioning bush 80 is provided to the case 76.The pressure cylinder 73 pushes the pressure main body 78 and the case 76 downwardly so that the lead wire 75 comes in contact with the upper surface of the object 15 to be plated and, then, the whole area of the object will be masked by the second mask 77 while being pushed downwardly together with the rack base. Then, as shown in Figure 22 the lower surface of each of the objects 15 will be located in a position corresponding to the aperture 70 for the injection in the first mask. The plating liquid will be injected in this state to perform the partial plating. The support carriage 11 supporting the aligned objects that have been subjected to all the plating processes will now move toward the outlet end 8 of the second plating line 2, and prior to changing over to the lateral carriage 12a at the outlet end 8 by the forwarding pressure means 13 in a manner described above refer toFigure 15 , each object 15 will be sucked by the vacuum device refer to Figures 3 and 4 and removed onto a table 81. The emptied support carriage 11 will then be conveyed to the inlet end 5 of the first plating line 1 by the lateral carriage to resume continuous operation on the plating assembly line which is in the form of a closed circuit to perform the desired plating. As has been described above, the plating assembly line of the apparatus according to the present invention is in the form of a rectangular circuit and comprises different plating tanks successively provided thereupon. The support carriages for the objects to be plated are conveyed by a lateral carriage to change over to the other plating line by means of a forwarding pressure means from the inlet end of the first and the second plating lines. The objects having been plated will be sequentially removed from the support carriage by a vacuum device, and the support carriage devoid of objects will be loaded with a fresh batch of objects introduced by another vacuum device, thus enabling a continuous performance of batchwise plating operations, to effectively carry out a plating of a large number of strips of objects automatically. Thus, the present invention enables, by the employment of the lateral conveyor lines, the support carriages carrying a plurality of objects to be transferred to a second plating line running parallel to the first plating line by a laterally conveying line which forms a rectangular circuit of plating lines. The lateral carriage effectively conveys the support carriages by means of a group of sprockets including a driving sprocket and a chain which passes around the sprockets. On top of these advantageous effects of the present invention, the support carriage 11 for the objects to be plated can be freely brought into abutment with the upper surface of the plating tanks or to be dipped into the plating tanks so that the present apparatus can be broadly applicable to assembly lines with various combinations of plating tanks. Therefore, the present invention greatly contributes to design freedom of the plating line. Moreover, since the positions of the holders for the objects can be precisely and finely adjusted, the apparatus according to the invention becomes easier to handle. Still further, because of the vacuum device, the support carriage can move back and forth freely on the frame by means of the forwarding means and the tubular member is supported in a freely movable state against the support plate provided at the lower end of the rods of a pair of pressure cylinders attached to the carriage.The overall construction of the apparatus is thus simple, and even if the position of the object to be injected with the plating liquid and sucked by the vacuum device is changed, the injection and suction box attached to the lower end of the tubular member may well adjust the position thereof in correspondence to the change. The suction box which acts also as the injection box is provided with a pin which determines the lowermost position thereof, thereby enabling precise positioning. The suction and injection or introduction and setting of objects can be effectively conducted since the apertures bored for such purposes in the box can be adjusted to predetermined positions relative to that of the objects to be plated which have been aligned beforehand. A supply source of pressurised air may be connected to the suction injection box to cause the vacuum device to act not only as a vacuum device but also as a means to release the objects held by suction at the time of setting the same at the predetermined position for plating. In this way, an object can be easily removed from the suction box and set to a predetermined position even if it adheres to the suction box on account of a wet surface.
