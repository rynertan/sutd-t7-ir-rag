# BADDELEYITE SINTERABLE REFRACTORY COMPOSITIONS AND REFRACTORIES PRODUCED THEREFROM

## Abstract
A sinterable refractory composition characterised in that it comprises a major proportion, by weight, of unmelted baddeleyite a major proportion, by weight, of the unmelted bad deleyite being present in the form of particles having effective particle sizes of greater than 5 microns 0.005 mm and a composition thermally decomposable into an oxide of zirconium or hafnium at a temperature above 100 C, but below a sintering temperature of the sinterable refractory composition, in an amount effective to improve the thermal shock resistance of an article sintered from the refractory composition is disclosed. The present invention provides advantages over the prior art particularly in terms of reduced costs and improved resistance to thermal shock.
