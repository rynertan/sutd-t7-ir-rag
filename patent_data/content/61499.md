# CLAMP FOR ELECTRIC WIRE BUNDLE.

## Abstract
A clamp for an electric wire bundle for clamping electric wires arrayed on a chassis, a panel or the like, providing an easy clamping operation, difficulty in removing the engaging part and the ability to clamp electric wire bundles of various diameters. This clamp has a base plate 11 made of resilient plastic, a C shaped resilient band 12 having a clamping piece 13 projecting outwardly and formed integrally with the surface of the base plate, a guide piece 21 provided confronting the open end 14 of the C shaped resilient band at the periphery of a through hole 17 on the base plate 11 , an oblique surface 24 supported by a post 26 confronting the guide piece 21 through an inserting groove 22 , a pawl 25 formed integrally with the lower end of the oblique surface 24 , and an engaging piece 23 having an opening piece 27 projecting outwardly. A plurality of ratchet shaped teeth 16 are formed on the outer surface of the open end 14 of the C shaped resilient band 12 with both the edges 15 retained unchanged, the open end 14 is guided into the inserting groove 22 by the oblique wall 18 of the guide piece 21 and the oblique surface 24 of the engaging piece 23 , the pawl 25 of the engaging piece 23 is selectively engaged with any of the teeth 16 , and both edges 15 of the open end 14 are longitudinally and laterally held by the side walls 19 , 20 of the guide piece 21 .
