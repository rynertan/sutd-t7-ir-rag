## Description
POLYESTERCAR80NA.TE POLVETHERIMIDE BLENDS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention concerns novel polymer blends.More particularly, the invention concerns novel polyetherimide blends. Polyetheriides are unique thermoplastic polymers which exhibit superior physical and chemical properties, including high heat resistance, exceptional strength and excellent processability. These polymers can be used as wire coatings and are particularly suited for injection molding applications. Polyetherimides are conventionally made by reacting an aromatic bis ether anhydride with an organic diamine. Present manufacturing practices include solution polymerization or melt polymerization techniques or combinations of the two, as hereinafter described. It has been found that certain properties of polyetherimide polymers can be modified by blending them with other polymers which are compatible or which can form homogeneous blends. For example, Mellinger et al., U.S.Patent Application serial no. 365,584, filed April 5, 1982, describe polyetherimide polycarbonate blends which have advantageous thermal and physical properties. It is desirable to have a polymer system in which various physical properties, such as flexibility, can be controlled in a simple and convenient manner. The plastics fabricator can thereby tailor the properties of the plastic to the particular item being made. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with this invention, a polyetherimide blend comprises from about 1 to about 99 parts by weight of a polyetherimide and from about 99 to about 1 parts by weight of a polyestercarbonate. It has been found that the flexibility of these blends can be controlled over a wide range by altering the relative proportions of the polyetherimide and the polyes tercarbonate. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS In the present invention, homogeneous blends of polyestercarbonate and polyetherimide are produced. Such blends can be injection molded or compression molded into intricate shapes, and can be cast into films, which exhibit desirable physical properties. The individual polyestercarbonates and polyetherimides are prepared separately prior to the production of the blend. In general, the polyester carbonates contain structural units derived from dihydric phenols and or aliphatic dihydroxy compounds or glycols, and difunctional acids, the desired units occuring in various manners in the copolymer chain. The polymers, for example, may be of a random type, i.e., the structural units derived from the dihydric phenol, glycol and difunctional acids are propagated along the copolymer chain in a random fashion. Typical of such random copolymers are those resulting from the use of monomeric glycols, monomric dihydric phenols, and monomeric difunctional acids. Others may be of a random block type, i.e., the units making up the copolymer are randomly arranged, but at least one of the unit struc tures is polymeric in nature.Typical of random block copolymers are those in which either the glycol, dihydric phenol, or difunctional acid derived structural unit is polymeric. Still other copolymers are of the block block type in which the structural units derived from the various components are polymeric in and of themselves. In general, any aliphatic dihydroxy compound or glycol can be used. Included are the lower molecular weight, aliphatic dihydroxy compounds, such as ethylene glycol, propanediols, butanediols, pentanediols, hexanediols, including pinacol, heptanediols, octanediols, neopentyl glycol, aryl alkyl glycols, such as 4,4 dihydroxyethyldiphenyl, styrene glycol, xylylene glycols, dihydroxy alkyl ethers of dihydric phenols such as the dihydroxy ethyl ether of Bisphenol A, thiodiglycols and cycloaliphtic glycols such as 1 ,4 dihydroxycyclohexane, 3,2 bis 4 hydroxycyclohexyl propane, bis 4 hydroxycyclohexyl methane, among others.Among the useful higher molecular weight aliphatic dihydroxy compounds are the polyethylene glycols, polystyrene glycols, polypropylene glycols, polybutylene glycols, polythioglycols, polyarylalkyl ether glycols and copolymer glycols, the latter typified by polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol copolymers sold by Wyandotte Chemical Company and known as Pluronics, etc. Included also are dihydroxy compounds such as may be derived from dibasic acids and glycols, for example, the diethyleneglycol ester of adipic acid, or the diethyleneglycol ester of sebacic acid, the dineopentyl glycol ester of adipic acid or terephthalic acid, etc. Further glycols useful in connection with the invention are silanediols such as diphenylsilanediol, dimethylsilanediol, dimethylsilanediol dimer, methylphenylsilanediol, ethylphenylsilanediol, etc.Tertiary amino glycols are also useful, including among others Nphenyldiethanolamine, N methyldiethanolamine, N propyldiethanolamine and N phenyldi n propanolamine. Any polymeric aliphatic material having hydroxyl end groups is useful, including polyethers, polyesters, polyure thanes, polyacetals and polysiloxanes. Furthermore, polymers terminated with COC1 groups, for example, polyesters prepared from dibasic acid chlorides, are useful, as are polymers having OCOC1 end groups, such as polycarbonates prepared from phosgene. The aliphatic dihydroxy compounds or glycols can typically be represented by the formula EMI4.1 where R is a monovalent hydrocarbon radical, for example, alkyl radicals e.g., methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, decyl, etc. , aryl radicals e.g., phenyl, naphthyl, biphenyl, tolyl, xylyl, etc. , aralkyl radicals e.g., benzyl, ethylphenyl, etc. , cycloaliphatic radicals e.g., cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, etc. as well as monovalent hydrocarbon radicals containing inert substituents thereon, such as halogen chlorine, bromine, fluorine, etc. . It will be understood that where more than one R is used, they may be alike or different.R1 can be selected from the group consisting of alkylene and alkylidene residues such as methylene, ethylene, propylene, propylidene, isopropylidene, butylene, butylidene, isobutylidene, amylene, isoamylene, amylidene, isoamylidene, etc. R1 can also be a silane radical or can be polyalkyoxy such as polyethoxy, polypropoxy, polythioethoxy, polybutoxy, polyphenylethoxy, polydiphenylsiloxy, polymethylphenylsiloxy, etc. R1 can also consist of two or more alkylene or alkylidene groups as above separated by the residue of an aromatic nucleus, a teriary amino radical, an ether radical, a carbonyl radical, a silane radical, or by a sulfur containing radical such as sulfide, sulfoxide, sulfone, etc. R1 may also be a glycol dibasic acid ester residue derived from, for example, dibasic acids such as adipic, azelaic, sebacic, isophthalic, terephthalic and glycols such as have been disclosed above. Other groupings which can be represented by R1 will occur to those skilled in the art. The ester residue can be polymeric or monomeric. The subscript p is a whole number including zero to a maximum determined by the number of replaceable hydrogens on R1.The subscript q is an integer which may be varied as desired and R1, where q is more than 1, may be like or different radicals. It is understood, of course, that mixtures of different glycols may be used and where glycol is mentioned, such mixtures are considered to be included. Any dihydric phenol compound is useful in the practice of the invention. The dihydric phenol compounds used in connection with the invention can typically be represented by the general formula EMI5.1 where R is a monovalent hydrocarbon radical as defined above, R2 is selected from the group consisting of an alkylene and alkylidene residue in the same sense as R1 or an ether, a sulfur containing linkage such as sulfide, sulfoxide, sulfone, a carbonyl, a tertiary nitrogen or a silicon containing linkage such as silane or siloxy. R2 can also consist of two or more alkylene or alkylidene groups, such as above, separated by the residue of an aromatic nucleus, a tertiary amino radical, an ether radical or by a carbonyl radical, a silene radical or by a sulfur containing radical such as sulfide, sulfoxide, sulfone, etc.Other groupings which can be represented by R2 will occur to those skilled in the art. A is the residue of an aromatic nucleus, Y is a substituent selected from the group consisting of a inorganic atoms, b inorganic radicals, and c organic radicals, a , b and c being inert to and unaffected by the reactants and by the reaction conditions, m is a whole number including zero to a maximum equivalent to the number of replaceable nuclear hydrogens substituted on the aromatic hydrocarbon residue, n is a whole number including zero to a maximum determined by the number of replaceable hydrogens on R2, s ranges from zero to 1, t and u are whole numbers including zero. When s is zero, however, either t or u may be zero and not both. In the dihydric phenol compound, the substituents Y may be the same or different. When n is greater than one, the R s may be alike or different. Monovalent hydrocarbon radicals designated by R can be the same as those in reference to the aliphatic dihydroxy compounds described above, as may be those represented by R1.Among the substituents represented by Y are halogen e.g., chlorine, bromine, fluorine, etc. or oxy radicals of the formula O W, where W is a monovalent hydrocarbon radical similar to R. Other inert substituents such as a nitro group can be represented by Y. Where s is zero the aromatic nuclei are directly joined with no intervening alkylene or alkylidene or other bridge. The positions of the hydroxyl groups and Y on the aromatic nuclear residues A can be varied in the ortho, meta, or para positions and the groupings can be in a vicinal, asy n net rical or symmetrical relationship, where two or more of the nuclearly bonded hydrogens of the aromatic hydrocarbon residue are substituted with Y and the hydroxyl group.Examples of dihydric phenol compounds that may be employed in this invention include, 2,2 bis 4 hydroxy phenyl propane Bisphenol A 2,4 dihydroxydiphenyl methane bis 2 hydroxyphenyl methane bis 4 hydroxy phenyl methane bis 4 hydroxy 5 nitrophenyl methane bis 4 hydroxy 2,6 dimethyl 3 methoxyh ltl bis 4 hydroxyphenyl1 ethane 1,2 bis 4 hydroxy phenyl ethane 1,1 bis 4 hydroxy 2 chlorophenyl ethane 1,1 bis 2,5 dimethyl 4 hydroxyphenyl ethane 1,3 bis 3 methyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propane 2,2 bis 3 phenyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propane 2, 2 bis 3 isopropyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propane 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl pentane 3,3 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl pentane 2, 2 bis 4 hydroxy phenyl heptane bis 4 hydroxyphenyl phenyl methane bis 4 hydroxyphenyl cyclohexyl methane 1 ,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl 1 ,2 bis phenyl ethane 2,2 bis 4hydroxy phenyl 1,3 bis phenyl propane, 2,2 bis 4hydroxyphenyl 1 phenyl propane and the like.

Alternatively, the polyetherimides can be prepared by melt polymerization of any of the above dianhydrides with any of the above diamine compounds while heating the mixture of the ingredients at elevated temperatures with concurrent intermixing. Generally, melt polymerization temperatures between about 200 to 400 C. and preferably 230 to 300 C. can be employed.The conditions of the reaction and the proportions of ingredients can be varied widely depending on the desired molecular weight, intrinsic viscosity, and solvent resistance. In general, equimolar amounts of diamine and dianhydride are employed for high molecular weight polyetherimides, however, in certain instances, a slight molar excess about 1 to 5 mol percent of diamine can be employed resulting in the production of polyetherimides having terminal amine groups. Generally, useful poly etherimides have an intrinsic viscosity 1 greater than 0.2 deciliters per grass preferably 0.35 to 0.60, or 0.7 deciliters per gram or even higher when measured in mcresol at 25 C. Included among the many methods of making the polyetherimides are those disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos.Heath et al. 3,847,867, Williams 3,847,869, Takehoshi et al. 3,850,885, White 3,852,242 and 3,855,178, etc. These disclosures are incorported herein in their entirety by reference for the purpose of teaching, by way of illustration, general and specific methods for preparing polyetherimides suitable for the blends of this invention. The particular polyetherimide polyestercarbonate blends of the present invention have application in a wide variety of physical shapes and forms, including the use as films, molding compounds, coatings, etc. When used as films or when made into molded products, these blends, including laminated products prepared therefrom, not only possess good physical properties at room temperature but they retain their strength and excellent response to workloading at elevated temperatures for long periods of time. Films formed from the blends of this invention may be used in application where films have been used previously.Thus, the blends of the present invention can be used in automobile and aviation applications, for decorative and protective purposes, and as high temperature electrical capacitors, cable and coil wrappings form wound coil insulation for motors , and for containers and container linings. The blends can also be used in laminated structures where films or solutions of the blend are applied to various heat resistant or other type of materials such as asbestos, mica, glass fiber and the like, the sheets superimposed one upon the other, and thereafter subjecting the sheets to elevated temperatures and pressures to effect flow and cure of the resinous binder to yield cohesive laminated structures.Films made from the subject polyetherimide polyestercarbonate blends can also serve in printed circuit applications. Alternatively, solutions of the blends herein described can. be coated on electrical conductors such as copper, aluminum, and the like and thereafter the coated conductor can be heated at elevated temperatures to remove the solvent and to form a continuous coating of the resinous composition thereon. If desired, an additional overcoat may be applied to such insulated conductors including the use of polymeric coatings, such as polyamides, polyesters, silicones, polyvinylformal resins, epoxy resins, polyimides, polytetrafluorethylene, etc. The use of the blends of the present invention as overcoats on other types of insulation is not precluded. Other applications which are contemplated for these blends include their use as binders for asbestos fibers, carbon fibers, and other fibrous materials in making brake linings. In addition, molding compositions and molded articles may be formed from the polymeric blends of the invention such as by incorporating such fillers as asbestos, glass fibers, talc, quartz, powder, finely divided carbon, silica, and the like into the blends prior to molding. Shaped articles may be formed under heat, or under heat and pressure, in accordance with practices well known in the art. Homogeneous blends in accordance with this invention can vary widely in composition. Such blends contain from about 1 to about 99 parts by weight polyestercarbonate and from about 99 to about 1 parts by. weight polyetherimide. Preferred blends contain from about 1 to about 6 parts by weight polyestercarbonate and from about 6 to about 1 parts by weight polyetherimide. It has been found that by controlling the relative proportions of these components, the flexibility of the resulting blends can be tailored to the specifications dictated by the end use. Blends having higher concentrations of polyether imides are stiffer and those having higher concentrations of polyestercarbonates are more flexible. Generally, the blends of the invention exhibit improved impact strength over prior art polyetherimides. The following example illustrates specific polyetherimide polyestercarbonate blends in accordance with the present invention, It should be understood that the example is given for the purpose of illustration and does not limit the invention. In the example, all parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise specified. Example Several blends were prepared which contain a Commer cm ally available polyetherimide sold under the trademark ULTEMe by General Electric Company, Pittsfield, Massachusetts, USA, and a polyestercerbonate prepared from bisphenol A, isophthaloyl chloride, terephthaloyl chloride and phosgene. The weight ratio of bisphenolA isophthalyl chloride terephthaloyl chloride in the polyestercarbonte was 35 10 55. The polyetherimide used had the following structural formula EMI19.1 Ten percent solutions of the polyestercarbonte and polyetherimide were prepared in chloroform. These solutions were mixed to form 1 1, 1 3, 3 1, 1 6 and 6 1 weight ratios of polyestercarbonate to polyetherimide. Thin films of the blended polymers were deposited on Mylare sheets by spreading a small aliquot of the solution and evaporating the solvent. These films were then peeled from the Mylar sheets and observed for clarity and homogeneity. Each of the blends exhibited good homogeneity.The 1 6 polyestercarbonate polyetherimide blends were stiff and the 6 1 polyestercarbonate polyetherimide blends were flexible.
