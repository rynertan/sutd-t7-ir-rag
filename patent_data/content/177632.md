# Hot wire anemometer.

## Abstract
An electronic anemometer for measuring air mass flow in a conduit 12 having a straight length of temperature dependent resistive wire 14 a circuit board 28 for holding at least a portion of the electronic circuitry used when the anemometer is operating to maintain the wire at a substan tially constant temperature and generate an air mass flow indicating signal based upon the air mass flow in the conduit sampled by the wire, the circuit board being mountable on the exterior of the conduit a rigid support plate 16 having a pair of spaced apart openings 18 , the plate being fixedly attached to the circuit board a pair of electrically noncon ductive support inserts 20 each of the inserts being fixedly retained within one of the openings in the support plate and a pair of electrically conductive, resilient posts 22 capable of withstanding the elevated operating temperatures en countered when the anemometer is operating, each of the posts having a wire supporting end portion 24 fixedly con nected to the wire 14 , the end portions being spaced apart and positioned in a central portion of the conduit with the wire substantially transverse to the direction of airflow therein, the end portions being biased away from each other to hold the wire under tension, each of the posts further having a remote end portion extendable through an opening in the wall of the conduit and fixedly held by one of the support inserts, the remote end portions being electrically connected to the electronic circuitry.
