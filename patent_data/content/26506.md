# A process for the preparation of shaped, electrically conductive articles from silicon powder, as well as shaped articles obtained by using this process.

## Abstract
A process for the preparation of shaped, electrically conductive articles from silicon powder by means of sintering of the powder being pressed or sedimented in a mould at a temperature of 1150 1250 C in an inert atmosphere and in the presence of boron oxide, possibly followed by taking up a further amount of boron into the sintered shaped article. Boron oxide can be added from a solution in water. Boron oxide is used in an amount of 0.1 11 by weight, based on the silicon powder.
