# System for sensing spatial coordinates.

## Abstract
A system for sensing the spatial position of a moveable object 14 with respect to an energized conductive surface 10, 12 whereby the spatial coordinates x, y of the object are determined. The system provides a means of accurately measuring the coordinates of the object with respect to a two dimensional coordinate system independent of the third orthogonal dimension, thereby avoiding significant meas urement errors due to variations of the object s position in the third orthogonal dimension. The system also ascertains the coordinate z of the object in this third dimension, which can then be utilized as an independent control variable in the system. Further, the system can accommodate a number of energized conductive surfaces over which the object may be positioned and can determine the spatial coordinates of the object with respect to any such surface. In general, the system of the present invention can ascertain the generalized n tuple position vector of the object with respect to each of a plurality of generalized, energized conductive surfaces. In any of the foregoing forms, the energized conductive surfaces can be transparent.
