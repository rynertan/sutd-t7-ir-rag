# ORGANIC INORGANIC COMPOSITES CONTAINING SYNTHETIC MICA

## Abstract
Organic inorganic composite bodies demonstrating hydrophobic behaviour containing crystals of an organic polycation exchanged lithium and or sodium water swelling mica, the organic polycation being selected from aminosi lanes and organic chrome complexes are prepared by a process which includes the steps of a forming a glass ceramic body containing crystals selected from fluorhectorite, hydroxyl hectorite, boron fluorphlogopite, hydroxyl boron phlogopite, and solid solutions among those and between those and other structurally compatible species selected from the group of talc, fluortalc, polylithionite, fluorpolylithionite, phlogopite, and fluorphlogopite b contacting said body with a polar liquid for a time sufficient to cause swelling and disintegration there of accompanied with the formation of a gel and c contacting said gel with a source of organic polyca tions selected from aminosilanes and chrome com pexes to cause an ion exchange reaction to occur between said polycations and the Li and or Na ions from the interlayer of said crystals, whereby essentially all of said Li and or Na ions are replaced with said organic polycations. Paper, board, film, fiber, and coating can be formed from the exchanged gel, and dried powders thereof can be hot pressed to yield a body consisting of a cross linked organic polycation micra derivative.
