# Test medium and method for detecting phosphorus segregates in metallic material.

## Abstract
An aqueous solution containing 0.00005 to 0.2 mol 1 of copper ion and 0.0001 to 1.0 mol 1 of mitrate ion is effective to detect phosphorus segregates in a metallic material, particularly cast steel. Segregated phosphorus can be de tected by etching a surface of steel to be tested, attaching test paper onto the steel surface, applying the aqueous solution to the paper, maintaining the paper in contact with the steel surface for a sufficient time, and removing the paper from the steel surface. A red print is obtained when the solution is pH 6 or higher. A blue print is obtained by following the above steps, and further treating the paper with a colour reagent containing molybdate ion, and then with a reducing agent.
