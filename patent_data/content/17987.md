# Power tool apparatus.

## Abstract
The invention is directed to a power tool apparatus such as a table saw which includes a housing 20 having a table top 26 with an appropriate opening for a motor driven tool 42 . Pivotally mounted within the housing 20 is an assembly which in the disclosed embodiment includes a frame having a subassembly pivotally mounted therein. A subassembly includes the tool 42 , such as a saw blade, and the means for driving same. A first control includes a lever 44 connected to the subassembly for pivoting same. The pivotal movement effected by the lever allows for quick and coarse setting of the tool at a desired elevation with respect to the tabletop. The control lever further includes a locking arrangement disposed thereon which is manipulat able by the same hand used to coarsely set the tool eleva tion. The locking arrangement secures the lever to the frame at the desired coarse setting. A second control means likewise operable by the same hand of the operator, is connected to the subassembly, whereby the subassembly is pivoted independently of the first control. This second control provides a vernier adjust ment of the tool. The assembly can be pivoted about its pivot mount in the housing in order to change the relative angle of the tool top the tabletop so that bevel cuts can be made.
