# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR BLANKING NOISE PRESENT IN AN ALTERNATING ELECTRICAL SIGNAL

## Abstract
A noise blanking circuit for eliminating evidence of noise present in an incoming alternating electrical control signal, such as a shaft encoder or tachometer signal in a servo control circuit, is disclosed. The alternating electrical signal is input to a first input A of a shift register 44 having a plurality of outputs C, E, G, J . Clock signals having a preselected frequency are input to a second input B of the shift register 44 for digitally sampling the alternating electrical signal at the times of occurrence of the clock signals so as to produce digital samples shiftably stored in respective storage locations of the shift register 44 , which are connected to the plurality of outputs C, E, G, J of the shift register. The digital samples appearing at predeter mined ones of the plurality of outputs C, E, G, J of the shift register 44 are input to a logic circuit 50...60 for producing a first logic state low state as an output signal, when a first logic state appears at the predetermined ones of the plurality of outputs C, E, G, J of the shift register 44 , and a second logic state high state as the output signal, when a second logic state appears at the predetermined ones of the plurality of outputs C, E, G, J of the shift register 44 . The selectivity of the noise blanking circuit can be selected by adjusting the clock signal frequency and or the number of storage loca tions included in the shift register 44 and or changing the predetermined ones of the plurality of outputs C, E, G, J of the shift register 44 which are input to the logic circuit 50...60 .
