# Photographic image reversal process and photographic element for use therein.

## Abstract
A photographic reversal process is provided wherein a compound which reacts with oxidized electron transfer agent ETA to form a dye or other visible product or intermediate and which is associated with a negative working silver halide emulsion layer is prevented from reacting with the oxidized ETA formed on development of the, imagewise exposed, silver halide by a competing oxidizable substance with which the oxidized ETA preferentially reacts so that no dye or other visible product is formed by the reaction and wherein the concentration of the competing oxidizable substance is lowered and or additional oxidized ETA is formed at least in the areas of the remaining silver halide, so that on reversal development enough oxidized ETA becomes available in these areas to oxidise the remaining competing oxidizable substance and to react with said compound and form a dye image or other image. Preferably said dye diffuses into an image receiving layer to form a viewable image.
