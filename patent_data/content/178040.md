# Retractable knife handle.

## Abstract
A retractable knife handle 10 employs a blade carrier 20 mounting a blade 22 for longitudinally moving the blade 22 between retracted sheathed and extended unsheathed positions. A leaf spring 36 extends from the blade carrier 20 to engage an inwardly projecting cam surface 60 so that when the blade carrier 20 is shifted to the extended unsheathed position, the blade 22 is clamped between the blade carrier 20 and case 12, 14 .
