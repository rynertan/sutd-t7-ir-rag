## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to the polymerization of alpha olefins, and more particularly, to highly active alpha olefin polymerization catalysts comprising an organometallic promoter and a hydrocarbon insoluble component prepared from at least one compound of a metal of Groups IVB, VB, or VIB of the Periodic Table, at least one support material which is a divalent metal salt of an organic ester of a phosphorus acid, and at least one alkylaluminum halide. The Periodic Table referred to herein is that appearing in Handbook ofChemistry and Physics, 50th ed., Chemical Rubber Co. 1969 . In the polymerization of alpha olefins, both process efficiency and product characteristics can vary substantially depending on the choice of polymerization catalyst.For example, from the standpoint of process efficiency it is desirable to employ highly active catalysts which allow for preparation of polyalpha olefins in sufficiently high yields, relative to the amount of catalyst employed, that separation of catalyst residues from the polymeric product is unnecessary. From the standpoint of product characteristics, it is desirable to be able to produce a wide range of product grades using a single catalyst, and to this end, the catalyst to be employed should exhibit a relatively high sensitivity to agents, such as hydrogen, typically employed during polymerization to control polymer molecular weights.Further, the catalyst to be employed should be capable of producing polyalpha olefins having molecular weight distributions sufficient to ensure ease of processing. In an attempt to provide catalysts having one or more of the above properties, the prior art has proposed a variety of catalysts generally comprising an organometallic promoter and a supported transition metal containing component. Prior art that may be considered relevant to the present invention includes the following patents. U.S. Patent No. 3,901,863, to Berger et al., discloses highly active alpha olefin polymerization catalysts comprising an organometallic promoter and a supported component prepared by reacting a compound of aGroup IVB, VB, or VIB metal with a support material which is a compound of a Group IA, IIA, lIB, IIIA, IVA,VIIB, or VIII metal having at least one sequence of metal oxygen organic radical bonds per metal atom, and then reacting the resulting product with an alkylaluminum halide.The support material also may include other radicals, including to4 1 3, attached to the metal through oxygen. Additionally, the organic radicals attached to the metal through oxygen may contain hetero atoms such as O, N, P . . . in their chain. However, there is no suggestion to employ phosphorus acid ester salts as a support material. Similar proposals are found in U.S.Patent No. 3,718,636, toStevens et al., and British Patent No. 1,309,987, toSolvay, both of which disclose alpha olefin polymerization catalysts comprising an organometallic promoter and a component prepared by treatment of a support material which is a compound of a divalent metal such as calcium, zinc, manganese, cobalt, nickel, or magnesium, with an organometallic compound and reaction of the resulting product with a halide or oxohalide of a GroupIVB, VB, or VIB metal. It is disclosed that suitable support materials include salts of inorganic oxyacids, for example, sulfates, nitrates, phosphates, carbonates and silicates. A related proposal is found in U.S.Patent No. 3,214,417, to Bloyaert et al., which discloses alpha olefin polymerization catalysts comprising an organometallic promoter and a component prepared from a support material which is an inorganic phosphate salt, and a halide, alkoxide, or alkoxyhalide of a Group IVB,VB, or VIB metal. Hydrated metal orthophosphates and hydrated and anhydrous hydroxyphosphates are specifically disclosed as useful support materials. Stevens et al., Solvay, and Bloyaert et al. fail to suggest the use of phosphorus acid ester salts as support materials. Although certain of the above described catalysts exhibit one or more desirable properties, the majority fail to exhibit a suitable balance of high activity, sensitivity to molecular weight control agents, and capability to produce polyalpha olefins having suitable molecular weight distributions. Accordingly, there is a need for an improved alpha olefin polymerization catalyst having a suitable balance of properties. It is an object of this invention to provide an improved alphaolefin polymerization catalyst and a method for the preparation thereof.A further object of the invention is to provide alpha olefin polymerization catalysts having sufficiently high activities to eliminate the need for separation of catalyst residues from polymeric products, sufficiently high sensitivity to molecular weight control agents as to allow for the preparation of a wide range of product grades using a single catalyst, and the ability to produce polyalpha olefins which are easily processed. A further object of the invention is to provide for the polymerization of alpha olefins in the presence of such catalysts. Other objects of the invention will be apparent to persons of skill in the art from the following description and the appended claims. We have found that the objects of this invention can be achieved through the use of divalent metal salts of phosphorus acid esters having at least one phosphorus acid ester group bonded to metal through oxygen or sulfur as support materials in the preparation of supported, transition metal containing catalyst components.The invented supported catalyst components, when combined with an organometallic promoter and employed in the polymerization of alpha olefins, exhibit a relatively high sensitivity to molecular weight control agents and are capable of producing polyalpha olefins having molecular weight distributions sufficient to ensure ease of processing, and as such, are useful in the preparation of commercially useful polymeric products. Moreover, the catalysts exhibit extremely high activities, and accordingly, such commercially useful products can be produced without the need for separation of catalyst residues. Additionally, polymers produced in the presence of the invented catalysts contain advantageously low levels of fine particles such that handling and processing of the polymers is facilitated.Moreover, the invented catalysts offer advantages in terms of compatability with polymerization systems wherein temporarily and reversibly deactivated catalyst components are added to a polymerization zone in a flush stream containing polymerizable alpha olefin or otherwise contact polymerizable monomer prior to entry into the polymerization zone because the components can be temporarily and reversibly deactivated by contact with conventional deactivation agents prior to entry into the polymerization zone and then activated with an organometallic promoter within the polymerization zone. As noted above, a variety of alpha olefin polymerization catalysts containing supported components prepared from compounds of the Group IVB, VB, or VIB metals and support materials which are compounds of divalent metals have been reported and it is generally known that catalyst performance can vary substantially depending on the choice of support material. However, the highly desirable performance of the invented catalysts could not have been predicted from that of known catalysts. Thus, as illustrated in the examples appearing hereinafter, the use of divalent metal salts of organic esters of phosphorus acids as support materials leads to catalysts of unexpectedly high activities as compared with the activities of known catalysts containing supported components prepared from divalent metal salts of inorganic phosphates. The invented catalysts also allow for significantly greater control of polymer molecular weights than do such prior art catalysts. It also is surprising that phosphorus acid ester salts of not only magnesium, but also other divalent metals such as manganese and iron can be employed according to this invention to obtain highly desirable results. While the prior art has disclosed the use of salts of a wide variety of metals as support materials, persons of skill in the art are well aware that the use of salts of metals other than magnesium typically leads to catalysts of little practical value. Divalent metal salts of organic esters of phosphorus acids have been disclosed as being useful in the preparation of unsupported, vanadium and chromium organophosphates useful as alpha olefin polymerization catalyst components, and such prior art may be of interest to the present invention. For example, U.S. PatentNo. 3,910,976, to Fein, discloses hydrocarbon soluble halo or pseudo halo derivatives of vanadium organophosphates which are prepared by reaction, in aqueous solution, of divalent metal salts of halogen containing phosphorus acid esters, including salts of beryllium, magnesium, calcium, zinc, strontium, cadmium, and barium, with tetravalent vanadyl salts such as the sulfate, halides, oxalate, or acetate.The disclosed compositions are combined with an organoaluminum halide and employed in the polymerization of alpha olefins, and particularly in the preparation of EP and EPDM rubbers.U.S. Patent No. 3,669,945 to Nakaguchi et al., also discloses compositions useful as alpha olefin polymerization catalyst components and prepared by reacting, either neat or in the presence of water and or alcohol, a vanadium compound, such as an oxide, halide, oxohalide, sulfate, oxosulfate, or a salt or ester of vanadic acid, with a phosphoric acid or a salt thereof or an ester thereof with an alcohol, and treating the resulting product with an alcohol. It also is disclosed that the resulting catalyst component may be deposited on a carrier material such as a metal oxide. Catalyst components similar to those described above but containing chromium instead of vanadium are disclosed in U.S. Patents Nos. 3,901,825 and 4,008,359, both to Meyer et al., and U.S. Patents Nos. 3,969,272, and 4,041,226, both to Meyer. These catalyst components are hydrocarbon soluble chromium tris diorgano orthophosphates and are prepared by reacting, typically in the presence of water, metal salts of organic esters of phosphorus acid, including salts of divalent magnesium, with trivalent chromium compounds. The use of silica, talc, and other non reinforcing powdered fillers as carriers for such catalyst components also is disclosed. Although the above described patents may be of interest to the present invention in disclosing the use of divalent metal salts of organic esters of phosphorus acids in the preparation of alpha olefin polymerization catalyst components, the invented catalyst components are clearly distinguishable. In contrast to the disclosed, unsupported, vanadium and chromium organophosphates, which may be prepared by reaction of vanadium or chromium compounds with divalent metal salts of organic esters of phosphorus acids such that metathesis of the metals takes place, the invented catalyst components are supported, hydrocarbon insoluble materials prepared by bonding compounds of the Group IVB, VB, or VIB metals to divalent metal salts of organic esters of phosphorus acids. Moreover, the catalyst components of the aforesaid patents typically are prepared in the presence of water.In contrast, water acts as a poison to the invented catalyst components and is excluded during preparation. Further, the catalysts of such patents exhibit low activities as compared to the invented catalysts. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Briefly, the catalysts of this invention comprise A an organometallic promoter and B a solid, hydrocarbon insoluble reaction product of components comprising at least one compound of a metal of Groups IVB,VB, or VIB of the Periodic Table, at least one divalent metal salt of a phosphorus acid ester having at least one phosphorus acid ester group bonded to metal through oxygen or sulfur, and at least one alkylaluminum halide.

Certain of the alkoxides, alkoxyhalides, oxoalkoxides, and oxoalkoxyhalides are commonly available in the form of complexes with an alcohol. An example is Zr OC4H9 4.4H9OH.For purposes hereof, the terms alkoxide, alkoxyhalide, oxoalkoxide, and oxoalkoxyhalide and the specific examples set forth above are intended to include such complexes. From the standpoint of activity, titanium tetrachloride and titanium IV alkoxides, and alkoxychlorides having 1 to about 6 carbon atoms per alkoxy radical, and particularly the alkoxides, give best results. Titanium tetrabutoxide is most preferred in this regard. From the standpoint of maximizing polyalpha olefin molecular weight distributions while ensuring relatively high activities, best results are achieved through the use of mixtures of at least one titanium IV chloride, alkoxide, or alkoxychloride of 1 to about 6 carbon atoms per alkoxy radical with at least one zirconium IV chloride, alkoxide, or alkoxychloride of 1 to about 6 carbon atoms per alkoxy radical and or vanadium III , IV , or V compound selected from the group consisting of the chlorides, oxochlorides, alkoxides, oxoalkoxides, alkoxychlorides, and oxoalkoxychlorides having 1 to about 6 carbon atoms per alkoxy radical. Mixtures of titanium tetraalkoxides and zirconium tetraalkoxides, and particularly the butoxides, wherein the atomic ratio of zirconium to titanium ranges from about 0.1 1 to about 10 1 are most preferred from the standpoint of maximizing molecular weight distributions while maintaining high activities. Support materials useful in preparation of the solid, hydrocarbon insoluble, supported components of the invented catalysts are divalent metal salts of phosphorus acid esters having at least one phosphorus acid ester group bonded to metal through oxygen or sulfur. Preferably, the second group bonded to metal is the identical phosphorus acid ester group bonded through oxygen or sulfur, however, other groups such as different phosphorus acid ester groups bonded through oxygen or sulfur as well as alkyl, aryl, alkoxy, aryloxy, carboxylate, carbonate, inorganic phosphate, sulfate, halide, hydroxyl, or other suitable groups also can constitute the second group bonded to metal. For purposes hereof, a phosphorus acid ester group bonded to metal through oxygen or sulfur can be represented by the formula Y M Y P YR A In the formula, M is a divalent Group IIA, lIB,IVA, VIIB, or VIII metal such as beryllium, magnesium, calcium, zinc, cadmium, tin, manganese, iron, or cobalt, with magnesium, manganese, and iron being preferred and magnesium most preferred. Each Y in the formula is independently oxygen or sulfur, with oxygen being preferred.A in the formula is hydrogen, YH, R, or YR, and each R is independently an organic radical or a halo or amino substituted organic radical, said organic radical being an alkyl radical of 1 to about 12. carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, butyl, octyl, and dodecyl, an aryl radical of 6 to about 10 carbon atoms, such as phenyl and naphthyl, or an alkaryl or aralkyl radical of 7 to about 12 carbon atoms such as tolyl, cresyl, ethylphenyl, butylphenyl, hexylphenyl, phenylethyl, and phenylbutyl.

Among the above described phosphorus acid ester salts, the bis dialkyl orthophosphate salts of magnesium, manganese II , and iron II having 1 to about 6 carbon atoms per alkyl radical are most preferred. From the standpoint of catalytic activity, the bis dialkyl orthophosphate salts of magnesium and manganese II , and especially the former, give best results. Maximum activity is attained through the use of magnesium bis diethyl orthophosphate . The above described salts of phosphorus acid esters are known compounds and can be prepared according to known methods such as by reacting appropriate metal halides with appropriate phosphorus acid esters or thioesters as reported in Mikulski, C. M., et al.,Chem. Abs., vol. 80 p. 518 1974 and Mikulski, C. M., et al. Chem. Abs., vol. 75, pp. 485 6 1971 and by reacting phosphorous pentoxide, halides of appropriate metals, and hydroxyl group containing organic compounds as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,401,184, to Revukas.When such preparative methods are employed, care should be taken to dry the metal halides employed as starting materials, such as by heating or contacting with a chemical drying agent such as thionyl chloride. It also is advisable to carry out the preparation under anhydrous conditions and to substantially remove hydrogen halide and or organic halide reaction by products from the products prior to use thereof as support materials according to the present invention to ensure that oxygen, water, and halogen containing by products, which can adversely affect the activity of the invented catalysts, are excluded during preparation of catalyst components.Anhydrous conditions can be maintained during preparation of support materials by carrying out the preparation under an atmosphere of an inert gas such as nitrogen or by other suitable means. Reaction by products are suitably removed by washing with appropriate solvents such as hexane, heptane, octane, nonane, and benzene. A preferred method for preparing support materials useful according to this invention, and particularly the phosphorus acid ester salts wherein both groups bonded to metal are phosphorus acid ester groups bonded through oxygen or sulfur, is disclosed in our copending patent application, Serial No. 973,108, filed in the name ofGlen R. Hoff and Peter Fotis on the instant filing date. The method according to our copending application comprises reacting at least one metal salt of an organic acid with at least one phosphorus acid ester in amounts such that a phosphorus acid ester salt having at least one phosphorus acid ester group bonded to metal through oxygen or sulfur is produced, and at a temperature such that the metal acid salt and the phosphorus acid ester will react without substantial decomposition of the phosphorus acid ester. Advantageously, the metal acid salts employed as starting materials are easier to dry and maintain in anhydrous condition than the metal halides employed according to the above described preparations.Further the primary reaction by products produced according to this method are organic acid esters which are more easily removed than are the halogen containing by products produced according to the above described preparative methods. The method disclosed in our copending application is particularly advantageous in the preparation of phosphorus acid ester salts wherein the organic radicals are alkyl radicals of 1 to about 6 carbon atoms because the metal acid salts and phosphorus acid esters employed as starting materials are such that low boiling organic acid ester by products are formed.These by products can be conveniently and substantially removed during the preparation through the use of appropriate temperatures and as a result, support materials of high purity can be prepared at high production rates. The metal acid salts employed as starting materials according to the method of our copending application are selected on the basis of the phosphorus acid ester salt desired. Suitable metal acid salts include the divalentGroup IIA, IIB, IVA, VIIB, and VIII metal salts of aliphatic acids having 2 to about 20 carbon atoms, aromatic acids having. 7 to about 12 carbon atoms, and aliphatically substituted aromatic acids and aryl substituted aliphatic acids having 8 to about 20 carbon atoms. Salts of monocarboxylic acids are preferred although salts of di , tri , and tetracarboxylic acids also are suitable. Specific examples of divalent Group IIA, IIB, IVA, VIIB, and VIII metals include magnesium, calcium, zinc, cadmium, tin, manganese, iron, and cobalt. Specific examples of the organic acid groups bonded to the aforesaid metals include aliphatic acid groups of 2 to about 20 carbon atoms such as acetate, oxalate, propionate, malonate, acrylate, butyrate, succinate, crotonate, vinylacetate, maleate, hydrosorbate, octoate, suberate, laurate, palmitate, stearate, oleate, linoleate, arachidate, and arachidonate aromatic acid groups of 7 to about 12 carbon atoms such as benzoate, phthalate, trimellitate, naphthoate, and naphthalate and aliphaticallysubstituted aromatic acid groups and aryl substituted aliphatic acid groups of 8 to about 20 carbon atoms such as toluate, xylilate, ethylbenzoate, diethylbenzoate, butylbenzoate, hexylbenzoate, decylbenzoate, tetradecylbenzoate, phenacetate, phenylbutyrate, phenylvalerate, and phenyllaurate.Certain of the unsaturated acid salts, such as the acrylates and methacrylates, tend to polymerize on heating. To avoid polymerization, it is contemplated to employ a conventional polymerization inhibitor in conjunction with such salts and or to avoid exposure of the salts to polymerizing temperatures. Specific examples of useful metal salts include magnesium acetate, magnesium oxalate, magnesium butyrate, magnesium vinylacetate, magnesium octoate, magnesium laurate, magnesium oleate, magnesium benzoate, magnesium trimellitate, magnesium toluate, magnesium hexylbenzoate, magnesium phenacetate, calcium acetate, calcium malonate, calcium stearate, zinc acetate, zinc maleate, zinc stearate, zinc trimellitate, zinc phenacetate, manganous acetate, manganous propionate, manganous octoate, manganous succinate, manganous oleate, manganous benzoate, manganous toluate, manganous phenacetate, ferrous acetate, ferrous maleate, ferrous benzoate, and ferrous phenacetate. As can be appreciated, the particular metal salt to be employed as a starting material will vary depending upon the desired final product. Mixtures of salts of the same or different metals can be employed if desired.The preparation involves replacement of organic acid groups with phosphorus acid ester groups and formation of organic acid ester by products which can adversely affect catalytic activity. Accordingly, irrespective of the metal contained in the metal salt, it is preferred to employ materials wherein the organic acid groups bonded to the metal are such as to lead to formation of low boiling organic acid ester by products to facilitate removal thereof. Preferred metal salts are those of calcium, magnesium, manganese II and iron II wherein the organic acid groups are alkanoic acid groups of 2 to about 6 carbon atoms such as acetate, propionate, butyrate, valerate, and caproate. Most preferably, the metal salts employed as starting materials are metal acetates.Specific examples of useful metal acetates include magnesium acetate, calcium acetate, zinc acetate, manganous acetate and ferrous acetate. In order to avoid contamination of support materials with water and other catalyst poisons, the above described metal salts are employed in the anhydrous state and to this end, drying of the salts prior to use is desirable, particularly with respect to salts of the Group IIB and VIIB metals as these are commonly obtained in the hydrated form. Known drying techniques, such as heating or contacting with a chemical drying agent can be employed. When a chemical drying agent is employed it is preferred to use materials, such as carboxylic acid anhydrides, which give by products which are easily removed from the anhydrous metal salts.Acetic anhydride is particularly useful in this regard. Phosphorus acid esters useful according to the method of our copending application are compounds of the formula Y P YR 2A, wherein each Y is independently oxygen or sulfur A is hydrogen, YH, YR, or R and each R is independently an organic radical or an aminoor halo substituted organic radical, such organic radicals being selected from the group consisting of alkyl radicals of 1 to about 12 carbon atoms, aryl radicals of 6 to about 10 carbon atoms, and aralkyl and alkaryl radicals of 7 to about 12 carbon atoms.

The particular phosphorus acid ester to be employed according to the method of our copending application will vary depending on the desired final product. As noted above, preferred support materials are phosphorus acid ester salts wherein the organic radicals are alkyl radicals of 1 to about 6 carbon atoms. In preparation of these salts, phosphorus acid esters employed as starting materials are those wherein each R in the formulaY P YR 2A is an alkyl radical of 1 to about 6 carbon atoms.Specific examples of phosphorus acid esters wherein each R in the formula Y P YR 2A is an alkyl radical of 1 to about 6 carbon atoms include the dimethyl, diethyl, dipropyl, dibutyl, dipentyl, and di hexyl phosphites, mono and dithiophosphites, thionophosphites, mono and dithiothionophosphites, orthophosphates, mono , di , and trithiophosphates, thionophosphates, mono , di , and trithiothionophosphates, the trimethyl, triethyl, tripropyl, tributyl, tripentyl, and trihexyl orthophosphates, mono , di , and trithiophosphates, thionophosphates, and mono , di , and trithiothionophosphates, and the dimethyl, diethyl, dipropyl, dibutyl, dipentyl and dihexyl alkylphosphonates, monoand dithioalkylphosphonates, alkylthionophosphonates, and mono and dithioalkylthionophosphonates wherein the alkyl groups are methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, or hexyl.Also as described above, the phosphite, orthophosphate, and alkylphosphonate salts are preferred over the sulfur containing phosphorus acid ester salts.Phosphorus acid esters wherein each Y in the formulaY P YR 2A is oxygen are employed in preparation of such materials. The support materials which are most preferred according to this invention are the dialkyl orthophosphate salts, and particularly the diethyl orthophosphate salts, and accordingly, the phosphorus acid esters used in preparation of these materials are the trialkyl orthophosphates, and particularly, triethyl orthophosphate. The above described starting materials are employed in amounts sufficient to give a phosphorus acid ester salt having at least one phosphorus acid ester group bonded to metal through oxygen or sulfur. Preferably, this amount is such that the equivalent ratio of phosphorus acid ester to metal carboxylate bonds in the metal acid salt ranges from about 0.5 1 to about 10 1.At equivalent ratios below about 1 1, mixed organic acid phosphorus acid ester salts and or mixtures of organic acid salts and phosphorus acid ester salts are produced. While these mixed salts and mixtures of salts are useful as support materials, the preferred support materials are those wherein both groups bonded to metal are phosphorus acid ester groups bonded through oxygen or sulfur. Accordingly, equivalent ratios of phosphorus acid ester to metal carboxylate bonds which are more preferred range from about 1 1 to about 10 1. Advantageously, an excess of the phosphorus acid ester is employed because reaction rates are thereby increased.However, the excess should not be so great as to cause difficulties in removing unreacted phosphorus acid ester because the same can adversely affect catalyst activity.Accordingly, particularly preferred equivalent ratios of phosphorus acid ester to metal carboxylate bonds range from about 1.1 1 to about 6 1. Most preferably, this ratio ranges from about 1.1 1 to about 3 1. The preparative reaction is carried out at any convenient temperature at which the starting materials will react but not so high as to lead to decomposition of the phosphorus acid ester employed. Preferred reaction temperatures range from about 0 to about 1500C., with temperatures in the upper portion of the range being more preferred in order to increase reaction rates.Advantageously, in the preparation of support materials wherein the organic radicals are alkyl radicals of 1 to about 6 carbon atoms from metal acetates and phosphorus acid esters wherein each R in the formula Y P YR 2A is an alkyl radical of 1 to about 6 carbon atoms, the organic acid esters formed as reaction by products are materials which boil below about 1500C. Accordingly, such materials can be conveniently and substantially removed during preparation of the support material by conducting the preparation at temperatures ranging from that which is sufficient to distill the organic acid ester by product up to about 1500C. In preparation of the diethyl orthophosphate salts from metal acetates and triethyl orthophosphate, reaction temperatures most preferably range from about 70 to about 1500C. When the starting materials are selected such that low boiling organic acid ester by products are formed and such materials are removed during the preparation through the use of suitable temperatures, substantial completion of the preparative reaction will be indicated by the cessation of by product evolution. In general, reaction times range from several minutes to several hours, and preferably, from about 1 to about 20 hours. More preferably, the reaction is carried out over a period of about 1 to about 10 hours. The preparative reaction can be carried out neat or in the presence of a diluent which is liquid at reaction temperatures and substantially inert to the starting materials. Useful diluents include alkanes, such as hexane, heptane, octane, nonane, decane cycloalkanes, such as cyclohexane aromatics, such as benzene and ethylbenzene and hydrogenated and halogenated aromatics such as tetrahydronaphthalene, decahydronaphthalene, and o dichlorobenzene. The preparative reaction according to the method of our copending application is carried out under substantially anhydrous conditions to avoid contamination of the support materials with materials capable of adversely affecting catalyst activity. Conveniently, anhydrous conditions are maintained by carrying out the preparation under an atmosphere of an inert gas such as nitrogen. Drying of the metal salts of organic acids to be employed in the preparation is desirable in this regard as is purification of any diluent to be employed, such as by percolation through molecular sieves and or silica gel. As a result of the above described preparation, there are obtained divalent metal salts of phosphorus acid esters and by product organic acid esters. As noted above, when the starting materials have been selected such that low boiling organic acid ester byproducts are formed, the same are conveniently removed during the preparation through the use of suitable temperatures. By product removal also can be achieved by decantation, filtration, and through the use of reduced pressures. After removal of reaction byproducts, and prior to use as support materials according to this invention, the phosphorus acid ester salt preferably is washed with an inert hydrocarbon such as hexane or another alkane to remove incompletely reacted starting materials. Alkylaluminum halides useful in preparation of the solid, hydrocarbon insoluble, supported catalyst components of this invention are compounds of the empirical formula AlR mX3m wherein R is an alkyl radical of 1 to about 20 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, butyl, hexyl, decyl, and eicosyl, X is halogen and preferably chlorine or bromine, and m is greater than 0 and less than 3, preferably from about 1 to about 2. Mixtures also can be employed. Preferred alkylaluminum halides are those wherein each alkyl radical contains 2 to about 12 carbon atoms.Such compounds include alkylaluminum dihalides such as ethylaluminum dichloride, n hexylaluminum dichloride, and dodecylaluminum dibromide alkylaluminum sesquihalides such as ethylaluminum sesquichloride, and isooctylaluminum sesquichloride and dialkylaluminum halides such as diethylaluminum chloride, and di n hexylaluminum bromide. Alkylaluminum halides which are more preferred according to this invention are the alkylaluminum dichlorides. Most preferably, an alkylaluminum chloride wherein the alkyl radical contains 2 to about 6 carbon atoms is employed. Ethylaluminum dichloride is especially preferred. The supported catalyst components of this invention are prepared by reacting components comprising at least one compound of a Group IVB, VB, or VIB metal, at least one divalent metal salt of a phosphorus acid ester having at least one phosphorus acid ester group bonded to metal through oxygen or sulfur, and at least one alkylaluminum halide such that a solid, hydrocarbon insoluble catalyst component is formed. The sequence in which the above described components are combined is not critical except that theGroup IVB, VB, or VIB metal component should not be contacted with the alkylaluminum halide prior to addition of the support material because in some cases an undesirable reduction of the Group IVB, VB, or VIB metal takes place. Usefully, the Group IVB, VB, or VIB metal component, the support material, and the alkylaluminum halide are combined concurrently or the support material and one of the other components are combined and then the remaining component is added to the result.The preferred preparative sequence according to this invention is to first combine the Group IVB, VB, or VIB metal component and the support material and then add the alkylaluminum halide component to the result. Irrespective of the sequence in which the abovedescribed components are combined, reaction temperatures suitably range from about 30 to about 1800C. Preferably, temperatures range from about 15 to about 600C.Suitable reaction times range from several minutes to several hours, and preferably, from about 1 2 to about 10 hours. When the Group IVB, VB, or VIB metal component and the support material are combined in a first step followed by addition of thevalkylaluminum halide to the result according to the most preferred preparative sequence, it is most preferred to carry out the first step over a period of about 1 4 to about 5 hours and then combine and react the alkylaluminum halide with the resulting product over a period of about 1 4 to about 5 hours. The above described preparation can be carried out neat or in the presence of an inert diluent. In preparative steps involving the alkylaluminum halide component, the presence of a diluent is preferred to make the component non pyrophoric and to aid in conductance of heat evolved due to the preparative reaction away from the solid catalyst component which ultimately forms. In preparative steps not involving the alkylaluminum halide component, it often is convenient to employ a diluent to facilitate handling and mixing of the Group IVB, VB, orVIB metal component and the support material. However, when the Group IVB, VB, or VIB component comprises a liquid in which the support material is soluble, it also is convenient to combine and react such materials neat, that is, in the absence of a diluent. Diluents suitable for use according to this invention include hydrocarbons and halogenated derivatives thereof which are liquid at reaction temperatures and in which at least one of the materials employed in the preparation is soluble. Examples of useful diluents include alkanes such as hexane, heptane, octane, nonane, and so forth cycloalkanes such as cyclohexane and ethylcyclohexane aromatics such as ethylbenzene, and halogenated and hydrogenated aromatics such as chlorobenzene, o dichlorobenzene, tetrahydronaphthalene, and decahydronaphthalene. Preferred diluents are the alkanes and especially hexane. The preparation of the solid, hydrocarbon insoluble, supported catalyst components of this invention is carried out in the substantial absence of oxygen, water, carbon dioxide, and other catalyst poisons. These materials are conveniently excluded by carrying out the preparation under an atmosphere of nitrogen or other inert gas, although other suitable means also can be employed. It also is desirable to purify any diluent to be employed in the preparation, such as by percolation through molecular sieves and or silica gel, to remove traces of oxygen, water, carbon dioxide, polar compounds, and other contaminants which may be present in the diluent. In the preparation, the Group IVB, VB, or VIB metal component and the support material are employed in amounts such that the atomic ratio of metal contained in the Group IVB, VIB, or VIB metal component to divalent metal contained in the support material ranges from about 0.05 1 to about 10 1. Preferably, this ratio ranges from about 0.1 1 to about 4 1, and more preferably, from about 0.1 1 to about 1 1. Ratios ranging from about 0.1 1 to about 0.5 1 are most preferred from the standpoint of catalytic activity. The alkylaluminum halide component is employed in at least an amount which is effective to halide the metal contained in the Group IVB, VB, or VIB component and the metal contained in the support material. This amount varies depending not only on the amount of such components employed, but also, the halogen content thereof, the valence state of the Group IVB, VB, or VIB metal, and the choice of alkylaluminum halide. Broadly, the amount of alkylaluminum halide employed is such that total moles of halogen to metal bonds in the alkylaluminum halide component, the Group IVB, VB, or VIB metal component, and support material is at least equal to 1 the product of the molar amount of Group IVB, VB, or VIB metal employed and the valence of such metal plus 2 two times the molar amount of divalent metal employed.Of course, when combinations of compounds of differentGroup IVB, VB, and VIB metals having different valence states e.g., a combination of a titanium IV compound and a vanadium III compound are employed, 1 above will be the sum of the respective products of the individual molar amounts and valences. It is preferred to employ the alkylaluminum halide in an amount such that total halogen to metal bonds in the system ranges from about 1 to about 10 times the sum of 1 and 2 above.More preferably, the ratio of total halogen to the sum of 1 and 2 ranges from about 1.2 1 to about 8 1.Greater amounts of alkylaluminum halide also can be employed although gradual decreases in activity and difficulties in handling the final catalyst component due to agglomeration thereof often are observed with increasing amounts of alkylaluminum halide. As a result of the above described preparation there is obtained a solid, hydrocarbon insoluble, supported catalyst component which can be combined with an organometallic promoter and employed in the polymerization of alpha olefins. Useful organometallic promoters include any of the materials commonly employed as promoters for alpha olefin polymerization catalyst components containing compounds of the Group IVB, VB, orVIB metals. Examples of such promoters include theGroup IA, IIA, IIB, IIIA and IVA metal alkyls, hydrides, alkylhydrides, and alkylhalides, such as alkyllithium compounds, dialkylzinc compounds, trialkylboron compounds, trialkylaluminum compounds, alkylaluminum halides and hydrides. Mixtures also can be employed.Specific examples of useful promoters include n butyllithium, diethylzinc, di n propylzinc, triethylboron, triethylaluminum, triisobutylaluminum, tri n hexylaluminum, ethylaluminum dichloride, dibromide, and dihydride, isobutylaluminum dichloride, dibromide, and dihydride, diethylaluminum chloride, bromide, and hydride, din propylaluminum chloride, bromide, and hydride, and diisobutylaluminum chloride, bromide, and hydride.Organometallic promoters which are preferred for use according to this invention are the Group IIIA metal alkyls and dialkylhydrides having 1 to about 20 carbon atoms per alkyl radical. More preferably, the promoter is a trialkylaluminum compound having 1 to about 6 carbon atoms per alkyl radical such as trimethyl , triethyl , tri n propyl , triisobutyl , tri n pentyl , and tri n hexylaluminum. Most preferably, the organometallic promoter is triethylaluminum. The organometallic promoter is employed in at least an amount which is effective to promote the polymerization activity of the supported component. Preferably, at least about three parts, by weight, of promoter are employed per part, by weight, of solid component, although higher ratios, such as 10 1, 25 1, 100 1 or higher also are suitable and often give highly beneficial results. In solution polymerization processes, a portion of the promoter can be employed to pretreat the polymerization medium if desired. Prior to combining the supported catalyst components of this invention with an organometallic promoter, it also is contemplated to temporarily and reversibly deactivate the components by contacting the same with a suitable deactivating agent. In this manner, the invented catalyst components, which exhibit some polymerization activity even in the absence of a promoter, can be employed, without plugging of catalyst feed lines or inlet ports, in polymerization systems wherein catalyst components are conveyed to a polymerization zone in a stream containing polymerizable alphaolefin or wherein the component otherwise contacts polymerizable monomer prior to entry into the polymerization zone. Once inside the polymerization zone, the effects of the temporary deactivation can be undone and activity promoted by contacting the catalyst components with an organometallic promoter.Suitable deactivating agents, methods for using the same, and a method for introducing temporarily and reversibly deactivated catalyst component into a polymerization zone are disclosed in copending application Serial No. 854,831, filed November 25, 1977, in the name of Glen R. Hoff et al. which is incorporated herein by reference. Preferably, temporary deactivation of the invented catalyst components is effected by contacting the component with a suitable deactivating agent in an inert hydrocarbon or halogenated hydrocarbon liquid, such as that used as a diluent during catalyst component preparation, at a temperature ranging from about 10 to about 1000C. in amounts such that the molar ratio of deactivating agent to metalhydride and or metal alkyl bonds in the catalyst component ranges from about 0.1 1 to about 10 1.Examples of useful deactivating agents include aliphatic and aromatic alcohols, preferably those containing 1 to about 8 carbon atoms ethers containing 2 to about 10 carbons ketones containing 3 to about 10 carbons aldehydes containing 1 to about 10 carbons carboxylic acids and esters thereof hydrogen halides thiols mercaptans carbon oxides and sulfides and water.Mixtures also can be used if desired. Deactivating agents which are preferred for use with the supported catalyst components of this invention are lower aliphatic alcohols, and particularly ethanol. According to the invention the above described catalysts are employed in alpha olefin polymerization processes wherein at least one polymerizable alphaolefin is contacted with the catalyst under polymerizing conditions. Solution, bulk, and vapor phase processes are contemplated herein. Alpha olefins which can be polymerized in the presence of the invented catalysts include ethylene, propylene, butene l, pentene l, 4 methylpentene 1, hexene l, and mixtures thereof. Preferably, the invented catalysts are employed in the polymerization of ethylene or a mixture of ethylene with up to about 20 mole of a higher alpha olefin. Most preferably, the catalysts of this invention are employed in the homopolymerization of ethylene. The conditions under which the invented catalysts are employed in the polymerization of alpha olefins are referred to herein as polymerizing conditions and include catalyst concentration, polymerization temperature and time, monomer pressure, the use of diluents in solution processes, exclusion of catalyst poisons, the use of agents to regulate polymer molecular weights, and other conditions well known to persons of skill in the art. The amount of catalyst employed in polymerization is a catalytically effective amount and varies depending on a number of factors, such as reactor size, and choice of monomer and can be determined by persons of skill in the art from the examples appearing hereinafter. Polymerization temperatures will vary depending upon the type of process employed. In solution processes, wherein a solution of molten polyalpha olefin in an inert polymerization medium is formed, the temperature should be sufficiently high to avoid solidification of the polymer but not so high as to vaporize the diluent employed.In the solution polymerization of ethylene, suitable temperatures range from about 120 to about 2100C. In particle form polymerization processes, wherein a suspension of solid, particulate polymer in an inert polymerization medium is formed, and in vapor phase processes, wherein solid, particulate polymer is formed in the absence of liquid polymerization medium, temperatures should be maintained at levels sufficiently low to avoid melting of the polymer in the polymerization zone but high enough to achieve reasonable polymerization rates.Preferred temperatures in the particle form polymerization of ethylene range from about 40 to about 1100C. In the vapor phase polymerization of ethylene, temperatures preferably range from about 40 to about 1300C., and more preferably, from about 60 to about 1200C. In solution or particle form processes, the liquid employed as the polymerization medium can be an alkane or cycloalkane such as butane, isobutane, pentane, hexane, heptane or cyclohexane, or a hydrogenated aromatic compound such as tetrahydronaphthalene or decahydro naphthalene,.or a high molecular weight liquid paraffin or mixture of paraffins which are liquid at the polymerization temperature, or an aromatic hydrocarbon such as benzene, toluene or xylene or a halogenated aromatic compound such as chlorobenzene, chloronaphthalene or ortho dichlorobenzene. The nature of the medium is subject to considerable variation, although the medium employed should be liquid under polymerization conditions and relatively inert.Other media which can be used include ethylbenzene, isopropylbenzene, ethyltoluene, n propylbenzene, diethylbenzenes, mono and dialkylnaphthalenes, n octane, isooctane and methylcyclohexane. Preferably, a butane, pentane, or hexane is employed. Irrespective of the type of polymerization process employed, polymerization typically is carried out in the presence of agents which act as chain terminators and thereby allow for control of polyalpha olefin molecular weights. Most commonly, hydrogen is employed for this purpose. The amount of hydrogen to be employed will vary depending upon the molecular weight desired and can be determined by those of skill in the art based upon the examples appearing hereinafter. Also irrespective of polymerization technique, monomer pressures and total reactor pressures are maintained at levels sufficient to achieve reasonable polymerization rates and generally range from about 100 to about 1000 psig. 7 to about 70 kg cm2 , and more preferably, from about 200 to about 400 psig. 14 to about 30 kg cm2 . Polymerization time generally ranges from several minutes to several hours in batch processes. Contact times ranging from about 1 to about 4 hours are common when autoclave type reactors are employed. In continuous systems, wherein polymerization medium, if any, and excess monomer are recycled to a charging zone and additional catalyst and monomer introduced, contact times in the polymerization zone can be regulated as desired, and generally range from about 1 2 to several hours. Polymerization in the presence of the invented catalysts is carried out in the substantial absence of oxygen, water, carbon dioxide, and other materials capable of adversely affecting catalyst activity.Typically, special steps need not be taken to exclude such materials from the polymerization zone due to the positive pressure exerted by the alpha olefin to be polymerized. Purification of monomer and any diluent to be employed, such as by percolation through molecular sieves and or silica gel, or through the use of excess promoter to scavenge impurities also is helpful in excluding catalyst poisons. In polymerization processes wherein the invented supported catalyst components are contacted with a deactivating agent to facilitate addition of the component to a polymerization zone in an alpha olefin containing flush stream, it often is desirable to use excess promoter to scavenge the deactivator and thereby ensure the attainment of high activities. As a result of the above described polymerization in the presence of the invented catalysts there are obtained polyalpha olefins having molecular weights typically ranging from about 50,000 to about 3,000,000 in sufficiently high yields, relative to the amount of catalyst employed, that useful polymeric products are obtained without separation of catalyst residues. The polymers exhibit sufficiently broad molecular weight distributions as to be processable by a variety of techniques such as extrusion, mechanical melting, casting, and molding. The following examples illustrate the present invention and are not to be construed as limiting the scope thereof.

The titanium to magnesium to aluminum atomic ratio was 0.8 1.0 8.3. EXAMPLE 7 Into a flask equipped as in EXAMPLE 6 were added 13.7 g. anhydrous magnesium acetate and 60 ml. diethyl phosphite and the mixture was heated at the reflux temperature for about 1 2 hour. 15 ml. ethyl acetate distilled during this time. The liquid remaining in the flask was cooled to about 700C. and, on dilution with 100 ml. hexane, a solid formed. The solid was filtered, washed with hexane, and then dried in a vacuum oven.29.5 g of solid, containing magnesium bis ethyl phosphite and a minor amount of diethylphosphite due to incomplete washing and drying were obtained.

EXAMPLES 6 8 and TABLE 2 further illustrate preparation of support materials employed according to this invention, the use of such support materials in preparation of catalyst components, and the polymerization performance thereof. As can be seen from the table, with the exception of component 7A, catalytic activities were good, the components showed good response to hydrogen, and fines content was low. No polymer was produced in the run using catalyst component 7A due to incomplete removal of diethyl phosphite from the support material. The additional ethylaluminum dichloride employed in preparation of catalyst 7B was sufficient to scavenge the unremoved phosphite such that the catalyst was active. EXAMPLE 9 For comparative purposes, an inorganic phosphate salt, anhydrous magnesium phosphate Mg3 PO4 2 , was employed as a support material in preparation of a catalyst component. The component was prepared according to the procedure of EXAMPLE 2 using 7.25 g.anhydrous magnesium phosphate, 11.2 ml. titanium tetrabutoxide, and 73 ml. 3.37 M ethylaluminum dichloride in hexane. A sample of the result was removed and diluted with hexane and aliquots of the result, identified as 9A, were employed according to EXAMPLE 12. The titanium to magnesium to aluminum ratio was 0.4 1.0 3.0. To the remainder of the suspension were added another 50 ml. ethylaluminum dichloride solution, and a sample was removed. Aliquots of the sample, identified as 9B, were employed according to EXAMPLE 12. The titanium to magnesium to aluminum ratio was 0.4 1.0 5.0. To the remainder of the suspension were added another 50 ml. ethylaluminum dichloride solution and aliquots, identified as 9C, were employed according toEXAMPLE 12. The titanium to magnesium to aluminum ratio was 0.4 1.0 7.0. EXAMPLE 10 For comparative purposes, the catalyst component preparation of EXAMPLE 1 was repeated using 7.34 g.anhydrous magnesium phosphate, 5.0 ml. titanium tetrabutoxide, and 82 ml. 3.37 M ethylaluminum dichloride in hexane. Samples of the result, identified as 10A, were employed according to EXAMPLE 12. The titanium to magnesium to aluminum atomic ratio was 0.18 1.0 3.0.Additional ethylaluminum dichloride solution was added to the remaining suspension to give a titanium to magnesium to aluminum ratio of 0.18 1.0 5.0, and samples, identified as 10B, were employed according toEXAMPLE 12. EXAMPLE 11 For comparative purposes, a catalyst component was prepared using anhydrous magnesium acetate as the support material. Into a flask equipped as in EXAMPLE 2 were added 5.4 g. anhydrous magnesium acetate, 5.2 ml.titanium tetrabutoxide, and 100 ml. hexane. This mixture was stirred for a short time and then 35 ml.3.37 M ethylaluminum dichloride in hexane were added slowly with stirring. The result was stirred for an additional 2 hours. A sample of the resulting suspension was removed and diluted with hexane, and aliquots, identified as llA, were employed according toEXAMPLE 12. The titanium to magnesium to aluminum atomic ratio was 0.4 1.0 3.1. To the remaining suspension were added 20 ml.ethylaluminum dichloride solution, and a sample of the result was removed and diluted with hexane.

Polymer yield was too low to determine MI, MWD, or FINES. EXAMPLES 9, 10, and 12, and TABLE 3 illustrate the performance of catalyst components prepared using inorganic phosphate salts as support materials. Comparison of TABLES 1 and 2 with TABLE 3 illustrates that the use of divalent metal salts of organic esters of phosphorus acids as support materials gives catalyst components of superior performance as compared to catalyst components prepared from inorganic phosphate salts. EXAMPLE 11 illustrates a catalyst component prepared using magnesium acetate as the support material.While catalyst performance was relatively good seeTABLE 3 , comparison with TABLES 1 and 2 reveals that the invented catalysts are generally superior in terms of activity, hydrogen sensitivity, and fines content. EXAMPLE 13 Into a 500 ml. flask equipped as in EXAMPLE 2 were added 15.9 g. of the anhydrous magnesium bis diethyl orthophosphate prepared in EXAMPLE 1, 2.1 ml. titanium tetrachloride, and 300 ml. hexane. This mixture was stirred for about 2 hours at ambient temperature and then divided and used as follows A Into a 500 ml. flask equipped as in EXAMPLE 2 were added 145 ml. of the above mixture and 150 ml. hexane. 35 ml. of 1.12 M ethylaluminum dichloride in hexane then were added slowly at ambient temperature and with stirring. During the addition, the mixture turned brown and the solid agglomerated. Stirring was continued for about 40 minutes following completion of the ethylaluminum dichloride addition and a 4.4 ml. sample of the result was removed. This sample was diluted with 50 ml. hexane and aliquots, identified as A 1 , were employed according to EXAMPLE 15. The titanium to magnesium to aluminum ratio for this catalyst component was 0.4 1.0 1.6. To the remainder of the suspension were added 46 ml. of the ethylaluminum dichloride solution, and a 4.8 ml. sample of the result was diluted with 50 ml. hexane. Aliquots, identified as A 2 were employed according to EXAMPLE 15. The titanium to magnesium to aluminum ratio was 0.4 1.0 3.8. B Into a 500 ml. flask equipped as in EXAMPLE 2 were added 151 ml. of the titanium tetrachloride magnesium bis diethyl orthophosphate hexane mixture and 150 ml. hexane. 60 ml. of a 25 wt. solution of diethylaluminum chloride in hexane then were added slowly at ambient temperature and with stirring. After the addition was completed stirring was continued for a short time and a 4.2 ml. sample of the resulting suspension was removed. This sample was diluted with 50 ml. hexane and aliquots, identified as B 1 , were used according toEXAMPLE 15. The titanium to magnesium to aluminum ratio was 0.4 1.0 3.7. To the remainder of the suspension were added 35 ml. of the diethylaluminum chloride solution and a 4.4 ml. sample of the result was diluted with 50 ml. hexane. Aliquots, identified as B 2 were used according to EXAMPLE 15.The titanium to magnesium to aluminum ratio was 0.4 1.0 5.9. EXAMPLE 14 For comparative purposes, a catalyst component was prepared, without the use of an alkylaluminum halide component, as follows Into a 300 ml. flask equipped as in EXAMPLE 2 were added 2.6 g. anhydrous magnesium bis diethyl orthophosphate and 50 ml. titanium tetrachloride and the mixture was heated at about 1360C. for 3 hours. The resulting mixture then was cooled, the liquid decanted, and the solid washed with hexane several times to remove unreacted titanium tetrachloride. The washed solid then was suspended in 100 ml. hexane and a 12 ml. sample of this suspension was removed, diluted with 40 ml. hexane, and employed according to EXAMPLE 15.The atomic ratio of titanium to magnesium to aluminum employed in this preparation was 52 1.0 0, however, the final catalyst component contained a substantially lower proportion of titanium due to removal of incompletely reacted titanium compounds by washing. EXAMPLE 15 Aliquots of the catalyst component suspensions prepared in EXAMPLES 13 and 14 were employed in the polymerization of ethylene according to the procedure ofEXAMPLE 5 except that in some runs, the promoter was triisobutylaluminum TIBA instead of triethylaluminum TEA . In such runs, 66 mg. TIBA were charged to the reactor and 66 mg. were combined with the catalyst samples prior to addition of the samples to the reactor.Results are reported in TABLE 4.

Polymer yield was too low to determine MI, MWD, or FINES. In this run 60 mg. TEA were stirred with the catalyst component suspension prior to charging and 60 mg. TEA were separately charged to the reactor. EXAMPLES 13 and 15 and TABLE 4 illustrate the preparation and polymerization performance of catalyst components prepared using titanium tetrachloride as theGroup IVB, VB, or VIB component and various alkylaluminum halide components. As can be observed the use of diethylaluminum chloride as the alkylaluminum halide 13B gave a catalyst component comparable to that prepared using ethyl aluminum dichloride 13A but due to the lower halogen content of the former, a greater proportion of aluminum relative to titanium and magnesium was used to obtain such results. EXAMPLES 14 and 15 and the table illustrate the performance of a catalyst component prepared without an alkylaluminum halide component. Omission of this component led to insufficient bonding of titanium compounds to the support material, and as a result, activity was poor. EXAMPLE 16 Into a 500 ml. flask equipped as in EXAMPLE 2 were added 6.6 g. anhydrous magnesium bis diethyl orthophosphate and 11.3 ml. titanium tributoxychloride and the mixture was heated, with stirring, until the solid dissolved. The solution then was cooled, 270 ml. hexane were added and then 30 ml. 3.37 M ethylaluminum dichloride in hexane were added slowly with stirring. A finely divided solid began to form during the addition.Stirring was continued for a short time after completion of the ethylaluminum dichloride addition. A 2.8 ml.sample of the resulting suspension was removed and diluted with 50 ml. hexane, and aliquots, identified asA, were employed as described below. The titanium to magnesium to aluminum atomic ratio was 2.0 1.0 5. To the remainder of the suspension were added 18 ml. of the ethylaluminum dichloride solution and, after stirring for a short time, a 1.6 ml. sample was removed and diluted with 50 ml. hexane. Aliquots of the resulting suspension, identified as B, were employed as described below. The titanium to magnesium to aluminum atomic ratio was 2.0 1.0 8.0. Ethylene was polymerized according to the procedure of EXAMPLE 15 using aliquots of suspensions A and B.Results are reported in TABLE 5.

This example illustrates a preparation in which the support material and the Group IVB, VB, or VIB component were combined and reacted neat due to the solubility of the former in the latter. The neat, liquid reaction product of such components is easy to handle in subsequent preparative steps, and the use of large amounts of diluent as a suspending medium therefor is avoided. As can be seen from the table, catalyst performance was good. EXAMPLE 17 Into a 500 ml. flask equipped as in EXAMPLE 2 were added 2.8 g. anhydrous magnesium bis diethyl orthophosphate , 3.0 ml. zirconium tetrabutoxide Zr OC4Hg 4.C4H9OH and 25 ml. nonane. This mixture was heated, with stirring, at about 1450C. for about 2 hours and after cooling to about 250C., 100 ml. hexane were added. 9.0 ml. 3.37 M ethylaluminum dichloride in hexane then were added over a period of about 20 minutes during which time temperature increased from 20 to about 280C. A 20 ml. sample of the resulting suspension was removed, diluted with 50 ml. hexane, and aliquots, identified as A, were employed as described below. The zirconium to magnesium to aluminum atomic ratio was 0.82 1.0 3.6. To the remainder of the suspension were added 11.5 ml. of the ethyl aluminum dichloride solution over a 20 minute period.As a result of the addition, the suspension turned pale brown in color. After stirring of the suspension overnight, a straw brown color and some lumps were observed. A 22 ml. sample of the suspension was removed, diluted with 50 ml. hexane, and aliquots, identified as B, were employed as described below. Ethylene was polymerized using aliquots of suspensions A and B according to the procedure of EXAMPLE 1 except that the amount of TEA charged to the reactor was 40 mg. and the amount added to the catalyst suspension was 40 mg. Results are reported in TABLE 6.

This example illustrates catalyst components prepared from a zirconium compound as the Group IVB, VB, orVIB metal component. From the table, it can be seen that the use of a zirconium compound can lead to a broadening of polymer molecular weight distributions as compared with catalyst components prepared using titanium compounds as the Group IVB, VB, or VIB metal component. It also can be seen that activity was substantially below that of the titanium based catalysts of this invention see e.g. TABLES 1 and 5 . This decrease in activity was not unexpected, as it is well known that zirconium based catalysts typically are less active than titanium based catalysts. However, despite the general superiority of titanium based catalysts, it can be observed that the zirconium based catalyst component ofEXAMPLE 17 exhibited better performance than the inorganic phosphate salt supported titanium catalyst components of EXAMPLES 9 and 10. EXAMPLE 18 Into a 500 ml. flask equipped as in EXAMPLE 2 were added 10.4 g. anhydrous magnesium bis diethyl orthophosphate , 4.3 ml. titanium tetrabutoxide, and 11 ml.zirconium tetrabutoxide Zr OC4H9 4. C4H9OH . This mixture was heated, with stirring, for 2 hours and then cooled to about 900C. at which point 300 ml. hexane were added and the temperature decreased to about 500C. To the stirred solution were added 32 ml. of 50 wt. ethylaluminum dichloride in hexane over about 1 2 hour. A sample of the resulting suspension was removed from the suspension, diluted with 50 ml. hexane, and aliquots of the result, identified as A, were employed as described below. The titanium to zirconium to magnesium to aluminum atomic ratio for this catalyst component was 0.4 0.8 1.0 3.4. A series of additional catalyst components B D were prepared by addition of ethylaluminum dichloride solution and removal of samples. The ethylaluminum chloride solution was added in amounts corresponding to the following atomic ratios SAMPLE Ti Zr Mg Al B 0.4 0.8 1.0 6.5 C 0.4 0.8 1.0 10.0 D 0.4 0.8 1.0 15.0Samples of B, C, and D were each diluted with 50 ml.hexane and aliquots employed as described below. Ethylene was polymerized using aliquots of catalyst component suspensions A D according to the procedure ofEXAMPLE 1 except that 60 mg.

This example illustrates the preparation and performance of catalyst components prepared using a mixture of titanium and zirconium compounds as the Group.IVB, VB, or VIB metal component. From the table it can be seen that these catalyst components exhibited better activities than components prepared using only a zirconium compound as the Group IVB, VB, or VIB metal component, and polymer molecular weight distributions were broadened as compared with runs using catalyst components prepared using only titanium compounds as theGroup IVB, VB, or VIB metal component. EXAMPLE 19 Into a 500 ml. flask equipped as in EXAMPLE 2 were added 9.8 g. anhydrous manganous bis diethyl orthophosphate , 300 ml. hexane, and 3.7 ml. titanium tetrabutoxide and the mixture was heated, with stirring, at 680C. for about 6 hours. The mixture then was cooled to about 570C. and 45 ml. 1.12 M ethylaluminum dichloride in hexane were added, with stirring, over 1 2 hour.Stirring was continued overnight after which a 12 ml.sample of the resulting suspension was removed and diluted with 40 ml. hexane. Aliquots, identified as A, were employed as described below. The titanium to manganese to aluminum atQmic ratio was 0.4 1.0 1.9. To the remaining suspension were added 63 ml. ethylaluminum dichloride solution over 1 2 hour and a 9 ml. sample was removed and diluted with 40 ml. hexane. Aliquots, identified as B, were employed as described below. The titanium to manganese to aluminum atomic ratio was 0.4 1.0 4.5. To the remaining suspension were added 60 ml. ethylaluminum dichloride solution and a 0.8 ml. sample was removed and diluted with 50 ml. hexane.Aliquots, identified as C, were employed as described below. The titanium to manganese to aluminum atomic ratio was 0.4 1.0 7.1. Ethylene was polymerized according to the procedure of EXAMPLE 15 using aliquots of suspensions A C.

This example illustrates the preparation and performance of catalyst component wherein a divalent manganese salt of a phosphorus acid ester was used as the support material. As can be seen from the table, the performance of catalyst components B and C compares favorably with that of components prepared using magnesium salts as the support material. The activity of component A was low due to the use of insufficient ethylaluminum dichloride. EXAMPLE 20 The following procedure was followed in preparation of a catalyst component using an iron salt of a phosphorus acid ester as the support material A Preparation of Support Material Into a 300 ml. flask equipped as in EXAMPLE 6 were added 5.6 g. iron filings and 100 ml. acetic acid. The contents of the flask then were heated at the reflux temperature for 3 hours and a white solid formed.Excess iron was removed with a magnet and the mixture was centrifuged. The liquid was decanted and the remaining solid washed with 400 ml. hexane to give 16.3 g.white, solid ferrous acetate. 7.0 grams of the ferrous acetate were combined with 80 ml. nonane and 40 ml. triethyl orthophosphate in a 300 ml. flask equipped as in EXAMPLE 6. The mixture was heated at the reflux temperature for 2 hours during which 8 ml. ethyl acetate distilled. The contents of the flask then were cooled and filtered, and the solid washed with 400 ml. hexane.The solid then was dried in a vacuum oven at 500C. to give 13 g. anhydrous ferrous bis diethyl orthophosphate . B Preparation of Catalyst Component Into a 300 ml. flask equipped as in EXAMPLE 2 were added 13 g. anhydrous ferrous bis diethyl orthophosphate , 4.8 ml. titanium tetrabutoxide, and 100 ml. hexane.This mixture was stirred for a short time, and then 40 ml. 3.37 M ethylaluminum dichloride in hexane were added over 1 2 hour with continued stirring. A 2 ml.sample of the resulting suspension was removed and diluted with 48 ml. hexane. Aliquots of the result, identified as B 1 , were employed as described below.The atomic ratio of titanium to iron to aluminum was 0.4 1.0 3.8. To the remaining suspension were added 25 ml. of the ethylaluminum dichloride solution, and a 2 ml. sample was removed and diluted with 48 ml. hexane.Aliquots of the result were employed as described below.The titanium to iron to aluminum atomic ratio was 0.4 1.0 6.1. C Polymerization Ethylene was polymerized according to the procedure of EXAMPLE 15 using aliquots of catalyst component suspensions B 1 and B 2 . Results are reported inTABLE 9.

This example illustrates the use of an iron salt of a phosphorus acid ester as a support material and the performance of the resulting catalyst component. From the table it can be seen that the catalyst components, while less active than those prepared using divalent magnesium or manganese salts of phosphorus acid esters as support materials, gave good results. EXAMPLE 21 This example illustrates the preparation and performance of a temporarily and reversibly deactivated catalyst component. Into a 500 ml. round bottom flask equipped with mechanical stirrer and nitrogen purge were added 12.7 g.anhydrous magnesium bis diethyl orthophosphate , 5.2 ml.titanium tetrabutoxide, and 300 ml. hexane. This mixture was stirred one hour at room temperature and then allowed to stand overnight. Fifty fourml. of a 3.37 M ethylaluminum chloride solution in hexane then were added over about 1 2 hour. 43.4 ml. of the resulting catalyst component suspension were removed and aliquots of the result, identified as A, were employed as described below. The solid in the remainder of the suspension was allowed to settle and then 160 ml. of the clear supernatant were decanted and 200 ml. hexane were added. The catalyst component was stirred several minutes and again allowed to settle, after which 170 ml. clear supernatant was removed and 100 ml. hexane added. A mixture of 2.4 ml. anhydrous ethanol and 16 ml. hexane then were added slowly to the stirred suspension.A 42 ml. sample of the stirred suspension was removed and 2 ml. thereof were diluted with 50 ml. hexane. Aliquots of the result, identified as B, were employed as described below. To the remaining suspension were added 1 ml. ethanol and 6 ml. hexane. A sample of the result was removed, diluted with hexane, and aliquots thereof, identified asC, were employed as described below. Assuming uniform distribution of aluminum compounds throughout the supernatant removed from the original suspension, the molar ratios of ethanol to metal alkyl bonds contained in catalyst components B and C were 1 1 and 1 1.5 respectively. A series of ethylene polymerizations were conducted using samples of catalyst components A C. The polymerizations were carried out as in EXAMPLE 1 except that no promoter or hydrogen was used and the temperature was 270C. Results are reported in TABLE 10.

In the runs using 60 mg. TEA, 20 mg. were stirred with the catalyst component suspension prior to charging and 40 mg. were separately charged to the reactor. In runs using 100 mg. TEA, 40 mg. were stirred with the catalyst component suspension and 60 mg. were separately charged. Results are reported in TABLE 11.

From TABLE 10 it can be seen that the undeactivated catalyst component A exhibited some polymerization activity even in the absence of a promoter, while the deactivated components B and C were essentially inactive in the absence of a promoter. From TABLE 11 it can be seen that when combined with a promoter and employed in the polymerization of ethylene, the performance of the deactivated components B and C was comparable to that of the undeactivated component A . EXAMPLE 22 Manganous bis diethyl orthophosphate was prepared according to the following procedure A Drying of manganous acetate. Into a 500 ml. flask equipped as in EXAMPLE I and under nitrogen were added 30.4 g. manganous acetate tetrahydrate and 150 ml. acetic anhydride. The mixture was heated at the reflux temperature for one hour and then stirred for 3i days. The liquid contained in the flask then was decanted and the remaining solid was washed with hexane, collected on a filter, and dried in a vacuum oven at 970C. for several hours to give 20.6 g.of solid, slightly pink, anhydrous manganous acetate. B Preparation of the bis diethyl orthophosphate salt. The solid obtained in A was placed in a 500 ml.flask equipped as in EXAMPLE I and under nitrogen and 100 ml. triethyl orthophsophate and 100 ml. nonane were added thereto. The mixture then was heated and 24 ml.ethyl acetate distilled at about 750C. As the temperature was increased to 1100C. the solid completely dissolved but no more ethyl acetate was recovered.Heating at 1100C. was continued for about an hour and then the solution was allowed to cool resulting in formation of a slightly yellow precipitate. After the mixture had been cooled to OOC., the solid was collected on a filter, washed with cold hexane, and dried in a vacuum oven at 970C. for several hours. 37.1 g. of solid manganous bis diethyl orthophosphate were recovered. EXAMPLE 23 Calcium bis diethyl orthophosphate was prepared as follows A Drying of calcium acetate. Into a 500 ml. flask equipped as in EXAMPLE I and under nitrogen were added 47 g. hydrated calcium acetate and 200 ml. acetic anhydride. The mixture was stirred and heated at the reflux temperature for 1 hour. The resulting mixture then was filtered and the solid washed with hexane and dried in a vacuum oven at 760C. for several hours to give 48.0 g. dried, solid calcium acetate. B Preparation of the bis diethyl orthophosphate salt. Into a 500 ml. flask equipped as in EXAMPLE I and under nitrogen were added 19.65 g. of the dried calcium acetate from A , 150 ml. triethyl orthophsophate, and 100 ml. nonane. This mixture was heated to 1400C. to distill 75 ml. ethyl acetate. The resulting mixture was allowed to cool and then filtered and the solid product was washed with hexane. The solid then was dried at 1350C. in a vacuum oven and 37.3 g. solid calcium bis diethyl orthophosphate were obtained.
