# A multiple deck screening machine including a feed stream splitter.

## Abstract
A multiple deck screening machine in which particulate material to be screened falls into a series of chutes which divided it into fractions and direct the respective fractions onto screens 30 to 34 in a stack, in which the machine includes a feed splitter comprising, a series of vertically extending dividers 68a to 68i positioned in the path of the falling particulate material, the dividers defining channels A to J between them, the dividers dividing the falling material into separate fractions as it falls into the respective channels, each channel A to J leading downwardly to a separate chute 69a to 69i which directs the respective fraction from the channel onto a screen 30 to 34 of the stack, the chutes being at different vertical positions according to the vertical positions of the screens to which they lead, the lower chutes 69a, 69b, 69d, 69f, 69g and 69i includ ing portions extending laterally from their respective chan nels into the areas below upper chutes 69c and 69h , to provide flow areas which are wider than the respective chan nels which feed them, thereby providing wider entrances 70a, 70b, 70d, 79f, 70g and 70i onto the respective screens to provide better flow distribution onto the screens.
