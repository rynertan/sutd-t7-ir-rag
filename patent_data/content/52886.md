## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention pertains to a process and apparatus for blowing film of a normally solid thermoplastic resin and particularly to a technique for controlling the stability of the extruded molten tube. The technique of fabricating film from thermoplastic resins by extruding a molten tube of resin through a circular die and then blowing a bubble of said resin while simultaneously drawing the expanded tube onto a pickup roll means is old in the art. Orientation in the lateral and or transverse directions may be effected in the process. It is common to cool the extruded tube by blowing air or other inert gas on the external surface of said tube to cool and thus harden the resin to a point where it is manageable and strong enough to stand the tension of the take up roll and the gas pressure on the internal surface of the extruded tube.The solidified tube is normally directed through flattening means such as a collapsing frame and a pair of rollers, which may be driven, and flattens the extruded film tube. Between the point of extrusion and the terminus of the flattening means, the film tube is inflated via air or a like gas to form and maintain a bubble. Driven nip rolls can be regulated to withdraw the molten tube of resin from the annular extrusion die at a speed greater than the extrusion speed. This in conjunction with lateral expansion of the molten film bubble, decreases the film thickness and orients the film in two directions. With certain ethylene polymer resins having an extensional viscosity index equal to or less than about 4.5 weaknesses in the film wall may develop if the stability of the resin bubble is impaired, i.e. if the bubble shakes erratically. Cooling of the inflated molten tubing has been achieved by internal or external cooling of the film bubble or both. Regardless of the method of cooling, the point at which the molten film bubble solidifies is referred to in the art on the frost line . It is preferred to cool the molten bubble from the outside. U.S. Patent No, 3,548,042 discloses apparatus and. method for cooling an extruded film bubble, comprising an ann√πamshaped air ring having an annular insert mounted therein such that cooling air blown into the air ring is divided into three components l a lowermost component directed perpendicularly against the film bubble just above the die orifice 2 an intermediate component which arises helically clockwise around and in contact with the film bubble and 3 an uppermost component which flows in a counter clockwise direction in contact with the film bubble. U.S. Patent No, 3,568,252 discloses an annular device for cooling a film bubble which comprises separate cooling chambers, each provided with slits for blowing cooling air against the film bubble, and an inflating chamber between the slits maintained at a reduced pressure by virtue of the suction created by blowing cooling air from the upper slit. The reduced pressure may be controlled by means of valved air inlet tubes communicating between the open air and the inflation chamber. Alternatively, separate cooling rings may be provided, each having cooling air slits, the lower cooling ring being provided with an inflation chamber in which a reduced pressure is maintained by virtue of the suction created by the cooling air exiting from the slit in the upper cooling ring. The separate cooling rings are separated by another ring to prevent heat radiation. However, none of the prior art cooling devices and systems has given satisfactory bubble stability with polyethylene and other olefin polymer resins having an extensional viscosity index equal to or less than about 4.5. This is reflected in lower outputs of blown film since the throughput or takeup rate must be slowed down to preclude tearing or rupturing of the thermoplastic film being drawn from the extrusion die. This problem is delineated on page 112 of Modern Plastics,June 1980 incorporated herein by reference. It is therefor an object of this invention to provide a process for blowing film of a normally solid thermoplastic resin having an extensional viscosity index, 4.5. These are low strain hardening polymers.The extensional viscosity index is defined as the ratio of polymer extensional viscosity at a total Heneky strain of 2, to its viscosity at a total Hencky strain of 0.2, evaluated at a strain rate of 1.0 second 1. This index is a measure of the degree to which the polymer exhibits strain hardening i.e., increase of viscosity with increasing strain . The polymers which exhibit an extensional viscosity index of no more than about 4.5 include the low pressure, low density ethylene polymers described in commonly assigned copending U.S.Applications Serial No. 892,322 filed March 31, 1978 now abondoned and Serial No. 12,720, filed February 16, 1979 still pending a foreign filed application corresponding there has still been published as European Patent PublicationNo. 4647 . The above identified copending applications disclose a 10E pressure, gas phase process for producing low density ethylene copolymers having a wide density range of 0.91 to 0.94 g cc and a melt flow ratio of from 22 to 36 and which have a relatively low residual catalyst content and a relatively high bulk density. The process comprises copolymerizing ethylene with one or more C3 to C8 alpha olefin hydrocarbons in the presence of a high activity magnesiumtitanium complex catalyst prepared under specific activation conditions with an organo aluminum compound and impregnated in a porous inert carrier material.The copolymers as applied to these polymers, the teirm co polymers as used herein is also meant to include polymers of ethylene with 2 or more comonomers thus prepared are copolymers of predominantly at least about 90 thole percent ethylene and a minor portion not more than 10 mole percent of one or more C3 to C3 alphaolefin hydrocarbons which should not contain any branching on any of their carbon atoms which is closer than the fourth carbon atom. Examples of such alpha olefin hydrocarbons are propylene, butene l, hexene l, 4 methyl pentene l and octene l. The catalyst may be prepared by first preparing a precursor composition from a titanium compound .e.g, TiC14 , a magnesium compound e.g., MgCl2 and an electron donor compound e.g., tetrahydrofuran by, for example, dissolving the titanium and magnesium compounds in the electron donow compound and isolating the precursor by crystallization. A porous inert carrier such as silica is then impregnated with the precursor such as by dissolving the precursor in the electron donor compound, admixing the support with the dissolved precursor followed by drying to remove the solvent. The resulting impregnated support may be activated by treatment with an activator compound e.g., triethyl aluminum . The polymerization process may be conducted by contacting the monomers, in the gas phase, such as in a fluidized bed, with the activated catalyst at a temperature of about 30 to 105 C. and a low pressure of up to about 69 bar 10,35 24,15 bar 1000 psi e.g., from about 150 to 350 psi . The tubular blown film extrusion process may be employed to form a film from low pressure low density ethylene copolymers. For example, a process for forming film from one such low pressure low density ethylene copolymer is disclosed in commonly assigned, copending U.S. Applications Serial No, 892,324, filed March 31, 1978 now abondoned and Serial No, 12,795, filed Fe5tuary 16, 1979 issued as U.S. 4,243,619 on January 6, 1981 a foreignfiled application corresponding thereto has been published as European Patent Publication No. 5110 . However, it has been found that the film production rates obtained in tubular film processes with low pressure low density ethylene copolymers, utilizing conventional cooling devices and techniques are low compared to the rates achievable in commercial tubular blown film processes using conventional high pressure low density polyethylene. Specifically, the properties of low pressure low density ethylene copolymers are such that commercially desirable high film production rates have not been achieved without film bubble instability. Stated conversely, film bubble instability problems. prevent the commercially desirable high film production rates from being obtained in blown film extrusion processes with low pressure low density ethylene copolymers.The reason for such failures, it is believed, is the extensional behavior of low pressure low density ethylene copolymers.In comparison to conventional high pressure low density polyethylene, certain low pressure low density ethylene copolymers are softer and exhibit less melt strength in extension. As a result, when these low pressure low density copolymers are extruded from the die in a tubular blown film processes and are externally cooled by blowing air gainst the resin, the film bubble is unable to resist deformation caused by the increased cooling required by increased throughput rates. In other words, film bubble instability results at higher throughput rates since such rates require more heat transfer in the cooling process which is usually accomplished by increasing the amount and or velocity of cooling air which in turn deforms the film bubble due to the extensional behavior of low pressurelow density ethylene copolymers. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A process for blowing film of a normally solid thermoplastic resin having an extensional viscosity index t 4.5 has been found comprising extruding a molten tube of said resin through a circular die wherein the extruded molten tube is cooled with the aid of a cooling medium fed from one or more air rings, the improvement which comprises feeding the cooling medium from the lowest positioned air ring having an extended lip whereby said cooling medium exits from said ring at an angle of at least about 300 relative to the surface of the extruded molten tube upon which it impinges, wherein the tube is extruded at a rate of up to about 8.5 pounds of resin per inch of extruder die circumference per hour of extrusion time and whereby the molten tube is extruded and cooled in a stable manner free of erratic movements during extrusion.DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig. 1 is a cross sectional view of an extrusion die and conventional air ring Fig. la is a plan view and Fig. lb is a side view of the extended lip. Fig. 2 is a perspective view of an air ring. Fig. 2a is a side cross section view of the air ring. Fig 2a is a side cross section view of the air ring.DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The present invention by way of example is described by reference to low strain hardening polymers comprising low pressure polymerized low density ethylene polymers.In a broader sense it is applicable to low strain hardening polymers having an extensional viscosity index of no more than about 4.5. Low pressure polymerized low density ethylene copolymers are one example of such strain hardening polymers. In the tubular blown film extrusion process, a molten polymer is extruded through an annular die to form a molten tube which, when inflated with pressurized gas, is referred to in the art as a film bubble. The film bubble is cooled and flattened and then usually wound flat on rolls. Optionally, the film tube may be slit before rolling. Film made by such a process may have a wide range of thicknesses depending upon the particular polymer and end use requirements.In the case of low pressure polymerized low density ethylene copolymers, 2,54 um film thicknesses within the range of about 0.1 mil to 510 jum about 20 mils may be formed by tubular blown film extrusion although most film formed of these copolers 12,7 um 03 will be within the range of about 0.5 mil to about 8 I 1,7 us 51 1um mils, preferably about 0.5 mil to about 2 mils. As in conventional tubular blown film extrusion processes, the film bubble is formed and maintained by inflating and maintaining a positive pressure of gas e.g. air or nitrogen inside the tubular film. The gas pressure is controlled to give the desired degree of expansion of the extruded tubular film.The degree of expansion, or socalled blowup ratio, as measured by the ratio of the fully expanded tube circumference to the circumference of the die annulus, may be within a range of about 1 1 to about 6 1 and preferably from about 1 1 to about 4 1. As used herein, the language low pressure low density ethylene copolymers means copolymers of at least about 90 mole percent ethylene with no more than about 10 mole percent of at least one C3 to C8 alpha olefin hydrocarbon comonomer e.g., propylene, butene l, hexene l, 4 methyl pentene l and octene 1 which are copolymerized 10,35 24,15 bar under low pressure e.g., 150 to 350 psi . Such copolymers normally have a density no greater than about 0.94 g cc and typically their density is from about 0.91 to about 0.94 g cc. In addition, such copolymers generally have a narrow molecular weight distribution range Mw Mn of about 2.7 to 4.5 A specific example of one method for preparing such copolymers is more fully described in the aforementioned copending U.S. Application Ser. Nos. 892,322 now abandoned and 12,720, still pending and reference may be made to such applications for a more complete disclosure. Conventional extrusion apparatus and techniques, applicable to low pressure low density ethylene copolymers, may be employed in the present invention, e.g., commercially available extruders, dies, flattening means, nip rolls and windup rolls, etc., may be used. In addition, various conventional additives such as slip agents, antiblocking agents and antioxidants, may be incorporated into the film in accordance with conventional practice. Referring now to the drawings in Fig. l, air passes through air ring 2, and inpinges on the outer surface of an extruded tube 3, of polymer emerging upwardly from annular die 4. when extended lip, 6, is placed on orifice 8, of ring 2 it forms an extension of air ring lip, 9, changing the angle at which the emerging air strikes the surface of the emergin extruded tube 3 of polymer to one of about 300 relative to the film surface and the plane ring of 2. Fig. 2 shows the air ring 2, in greater detail fitted with an adjusting ring 10. The extended lip 6, can be positioned inside the air ring lip, 9. The invention is further described in the Example and Control which follows. All parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise specified. A conventional polymer extruder having three heating zones, 1, 2 and 3 was filled with an ethylene butene copolymer having a melt index of 3 and a density of 0.920 plus 57o of polyethylene having a melt index of 2 grams 10 minutes and a density of 0.918. The relative temperature, pressure and other data are shown in the Table below. From these data it is apparent that the extended lip modification of the air ring provided a higher yIeld of extruded film than did the Control. The 151,8 kg h.m relative amounts were 8.5 lbs. hr. inch of die circum 132,2 kg h.m ference for the Example versus 7.4 lbs. hr inch of die circumference for the Control. This is a significant improvement. TABLE CONTROL E1 LE EXTRUDER BASELINE WITH EXTENDED LIP Setpt. Actual Setpt.
