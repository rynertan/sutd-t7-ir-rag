# MACHINE TOOL WITH AUTOMATIC TOOL CHANGE FUNCTION

## Abstract
In a machine tool with an automatic tool change function, a rotatable tool spindle carries a key engageable with a key way formed on a tool. A tool change arm, serving as a tool support device, rotatably supports at least one tool to selectively insert and remove the same into and from said tool spindle. When a tool change operation is to be performed, the rotation of the spindle is changed into a predetermined speed suitable for the key engagement. An operating device is provided for causing relative movement between the tool change arm and the spindle to insert a tool into the spindle, however, the relative movement thereof is stopped by a stopping device just before the engagement of the key with the key way. Subsequently, when a first detecting device detects that the key reaches to a predeter mined angular position, the relative movement of the tool change arm is permitted to thereby make engagement of the key with the key way. A second detecting device detects the key engagement and then the tool is clamped in the spindle for a machining operation. After the machining operation, when a third detecting device detects that the key reaches to from the spindle.
