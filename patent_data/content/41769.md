# Transistor chopper circuits.

## Abstract
In a circuit for protecting the transistor 18 of a high current transistor chopper from damage due to inductive energy stored in the chopper circuit when the transistor is biased non conductive, the inductive energy charges a capacitor 34 connected in parallel with the transistor, and a return circuit 30 returns the energy stored in the capacitor to the source 16 while the transistor is non conductive and to the load 10 when the transistor is subsequently biased conductive.
