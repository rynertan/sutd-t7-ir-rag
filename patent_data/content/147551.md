# Electronic switching device.

## Abstract
An electronic switching device 6 for controlling an external load 22 comprising, input means 20 for accepting an external condition to generate an output signal, power switching means 11 in response to the output signal from the input means 20 for controlling a load current of the load, current limiting means 12 connected in series with the power switching means 11 for interrupting an abnormal large current flowing through the power switching means 11 , and short detecting means connected with the power switching means for detecting the abnormal large current to provide the current limiting means 12 with a stop signal so that the current limiting means 12 is activated by the stop signal.
