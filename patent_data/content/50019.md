VIII Compound B 27.8 Toximol R 3.0 Toximol S 9.0 Tenneco 500 100 60.2 Concentrate VIII was diluted in water and applied at the rate of 2.0 Ib. per acre to test specimens, in a areen house, of watergrass, green foxtail, shattercane, blue panicum, tallfescue, sprangletop, annual ryegrass, downy brome, wild oats, crabgrass, milo, corn, probred wheat and barley. The average herbicidal acitivity of two or more evaluations of each of the foregoing grass species was 80 or greater. Toximol R and S are surfactants of the Stepan ChemicalCorporation, Illinios. Atlox 8916F in a surfuctant ofICI Americas, Delaware. Tenneco 500 100 is an aromatic solvent of the Tenneco Corporation. EXAMPLE 24 Flowable formulations were prepared having the following compositions, percent by weight. XI A Compound B 3.00 Toximol 360A 3.00 Sun 7N oil 30.00 B water 60.85 Gelvatol 20 30 3.00 Relzan 0.15 Premix A was dispersed in high speed blender for about one minute and then Premix B was poured intoPremix A while stirring at high speed. After addition ofPremix B stirring was continued about 5 minutes. X A Compound C 3.00 Toximol 360A 3.00 Sun 7N 30.00 B Water 60.85 Gelvatol 20 30 3.00 Darvan No. 1 0.15 Premix A and B were combined as described for flowableIX above. Concentration of active ingredient 2.7 . Sun 7N is a non phytotoxic oil of the Sun ChemicalCompany. Gelvatol 20 30 is a polyvinyl alcohol, molecular weight about 1000Q of the Monsanto COmpany. Kelzan is a thickener agent xanthum gum . Darvan No. 1 is a dispersant of the RT Vanderbilt Company. Example 25 The compound, 2 4 4 trifluoromethylphenoxy phenoxy propionyl meldrum acid V W is oxyen, R is 4 trifluoromethylphenyl, and RÚ is methyl is reacted with the alcohol R OH using the procedure of Example 20 to prepare the respective ester under Table III. TABLE IIIEMI24.1 R CH2 CN CH2 CH CH2 CH2 CH C Cl2 CH2 C CH CH2 CH2 O CH3EMI24.2 EMI25.1 EXAMPLE 26 Following the procedure of Example 17, each of the 3 oxo esters under Table III is reduced using sodium borohydride to yield the respective 3 hydroxy esters of the following formula EMI25.2 EXAMPLE 27 Ethyl 4 4 4 trifluoromethylphenoxy phenoxy 3 hydro oxypentanoate is reacted with 1.1 equivalent of acetyl chloride and 1.0 equivalent of pyridine in benzene to yield ethyl 4 4 4 trifluoromethylphenoxy phenoxy 3 acetoxypentan oate. Similarly, using n propanoyl chloride and isopropanoyl chloride yield the respective 3 n propanoate and 3 isopro panoate. Carbonates of the 3 hydroxy compounds of formula C are prepared using the above procedure and 1.1 equivalents of, for example, ethyl chloroformate or methyl chloroformate.The 3 carbonates are useful herbicides for grass weeds also In the preparation of the 3 hydroxy compounds of formulaC , in addition to reduction of the respective 3 oxo compound of formula B , the 3 hydroxy compounds such as the esters can be prepared by the following outlined method.EMI26.1 The compounds of the present invention include the isomeric forms and mixtures thereof. Thus, the invention includes the optically active isomers and racemic mixtures.Unless otherwise specified herein, the compounds described in the examples are racemic mixtures, EXAMPLE 28 Each of the compounds methyl 4 4 3,5 dichloropyridyloxy phenoxy 3 oxopentanoate and methyl 4 4 5 trifluoromethylpyridyloxy phenoxy 3 oxopentanOate is reacted with NaBH4 by the procedure of Example 17 to yield methyl 4 4 3,5 dichloropyridyloxy phenoxy 3 hydroxypentanoate and methyl 4 4 5 triEluoromethyZpyridy loxy phenoxy 3 hydroxypentanoate, respectively. EXAMPLE 29 The process of Example 20 is repeated with the exception of using 2 4 6 chloro 2 quinolinyloxy phenoxy propionyl chloride as the starting material in place of 2 4 trifluoromethylphenoxy phenoxy propionyl chloride to yield as the final product, n butyl 4 4 6 chloro 2 guinolinyloxy phenoxy 3 oxopentanoate. By using 2 4 6 fluoro 2 quinolinyloxy phenoxy propionyl chloride as the starting material and ethyl alcohol in place of n butyl alcohol in the process of Example 20, there is obtained ethyl 4 4 6 fluoro 2 quinlinyloxy phenoxy 3 oxopentanoate which is reduced using NaBH4 in alcohol to yield ethyl 4 4 6 fluoro 2 quinolinyloxy phenoxy 3 hydroxypentanoate. EXAMPLE 30 The compound1 6 fluoro 2 4 hydroxyphenoxy quinoxaline, is used as the starting material in Example 1 in place of 4 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethylphenoxy phenol to yield ethyl 4 4 6 fluoro 2 quinoxalyloxy phenoxy 3 methoxy 2 pentenoate which is reacted with aqueous perchloric acid by the process of Example 3 to yield ethyl 4 4 6 fluoro 2 quinoxalyloxy phenoxy 3 oxopentanoate. The 3 oxo ester on reduction with NaBH4 yield the 4 hydroxy ester, ethyl 4 4 6 fluoro 2 quinoxalyloxy phenoxy 3 hydroxypentanoate.
