## Description
System and method for heatin a liquid by solar heatThis invention relates to a solar heating system for heating water for home and commercial hot water systems, recreational pools and the like.The basic reason for utilizing a solar heating system is to minimize the use of other power sources, such as electricity or gas, while still obtaining the desired heating. In most solar heating systems, however, it is necessary to provide a pump, which is generally driven by electricity, for pumping liquid up from a water heat exchange system, a swimming pool or the like to a solar array on the roof of a house, or, in any event, somewhat vertically above the fluid which is being heated. This is wasteful, and it is desirable to provide a solar heating system which would operate adequately without a separately powered pump.Some attempts have been made to utilize solar heat itself for pumping purposes in a solar heating system.For example, U.S. Patent 4,108,160 shows a thermosiphon type pump which intermittently pumps liquid downwardly in the daytime and draws up the liquid at night thus, continuous up and down circulation does not occur, and the solar collector and its support structure must be large enough and strong enough to hold substantially all of the liquid in the entire system, and the roof of a building upon which the solar collector is placed must be strong enough to support the collector. Alternatively, the solar collector must be periodically covered or shaded for the system to continuously pump water or other working fluid this pumping system does not operate continuously without external control thereof. Such control can require the user of the solar heating system to climb up on the roof of a house and periodically cover the solar collector, which is highly inconvenient.Thus, completely automatic continuous operation, during the daytime, is not attained unless some type of automatic shading system is designed and added and operation of such a shading system would inherently require energy expenditures.Solar heat has been used to lift liquid by means of pressure differentials controlled by float valves with the working liquid being vaporized by the sun s heatSuch systems are shown in U.S. Patents 2,20,17 and 4,061,131. However, in such systems t has been necessary to utilize a low boiling fluid as the heat transfer medium. Should any failure occur between the heat transfer system and the system to which heat is being transferred, potentially dangerous leakage can occur.Further, such systems are clearly not useful wherein the heat transfer liquid itself is discharged into a recreational pool such as a swimming pool and is also lifted therefrom to the solar collector.While the percolator pumping system using vapor to lift water is well known for extracting coffee beans, and has been used in air conditioning units with the use of external water for cooling the condenser, as disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent 2,761,656, such a system has not been adapted to solar heating, particularly since the solar oollector portion of a solar heating system is generally considerably above the fluid being heated thereby, and it is not really apparent that such a percolator system can be practically adapted for use with a solar heating system.It would be advantageous to provide a percolator pumping system as part of a solar heating system, wherein the solar heating system would not require an externally powered pump, could operate with relatively non volatile fluids such as water as a working fluid, could operate continuously during daytime, and did not require periodic attention such as covering or uncovering of the solar collector panel.The present invention is directed to overcoming one or more of said problems.According to the present invention, 1 provide a solar heating system having a a solar heat collector capable of containing a liquid, and conduits for connecting the collector to b a heat exchanger or a pool of liquid, whereby a liquid can be heated in the collector and circulated through the conduits so as to be cooled and thereby heating a liquid in said heat exchanger or pool of liquid, the collector beingplaced at a level above the structure b , characterised in that the system includes c means for keeping the interior of the collector at a reduced pressure such that the liquid therein boils when the collector is heated by the sun, said means comprising a conduit for containing a column of said first liquid, the top of said column being in communication with the interior of the collector, d a second heat exchanger arranged above the collector for condensation of vapor produced in the collector, and e at least one lift tll ae communicating at its lower end with the top of said conduit and with the top of the interior of the collector and at its upper end with the condensing heat exchanger whereby the vapor serves to lift cooled liquid from the structure b to the condenser.The solar heating system may, in different embodiments, be connected to heat a hot water system or a swimming pool. The system does not require the use of a separately powered pump, but instead makes use only of solar energy. The system also does not require constant adjustment such as by covering the collector, or by carefully selecting the location of the collector.Further, the system can utilize water as the working liquid rather than more volatile, and at times dangerous, low boiling iiquids , and so an open system can be utilized wherein the water from the solar collector passes directly into a swimming pool or the like and wherein the swimming pool water is pumped into the system and forms a part of the circulating loop.The system can of course be sold as a kit of the aforesaid parts a , c , d and e , and b where appropriate, with instructions for assembly and use. The invention will be illustrated by reference to some embodiments shown in the drawings, wherein like numbers denote like parts throughout, and wherein Figs. 1A and 1B illustrate, in schematic view in two different stages of operation, a first embodiment of solar heating system in accordance with the invention Fig. 2 illustrates, in similar view to Fig. IA, a second embodiment of the invention Fig. 3 shows part of a modification of the system of Fig andFig. 4 illustrates, partially in similar view to Fig. IA, and partially perspectively, a fifth embodiment of the invention.Referring to Figs. 1A and 1B, there is illustrated therein a solar heating system 40 having therein a working liquid 12 which is usually water, optionally containing an antifreeze additive such as ethylene glycol. The solar heating system 10 includes a solar heat collector 14 and a heat exchanger 16. eDaratelyr a fluid 17 e,g. water is flowed, as indicated t l arrows, through piping 18 within heat exchanger 16 wherein heat is transferred from the liquid 12 to the fluid in th piping 18. The heat exchanger 16 can be tubing within a large body of liquid, e.g. a recreational pool.A conduit 20 serves for conducting heated liquid 12 from the collector 14 to the heat exchanger 16, and a second conduit 22 serves for returning the liquid from the heat exchanger 16, after it has been cooled therein, to the heat collector 14.Means, as described below, are provided for maintaining the collector 14 at a pressure below atmospheric pressure, such that the liquid 12 therein boils therein and produces a vapor 24 at a temperature below the boiling point of the liquid 12 at atmospheric pressure. Bubbles 25 of hot vapor are shown within the boiling liquid.The second conduit 22 proceeds from a level 26 to a vertically higher level 28 in the system 10. A lift tube 30 is positioned in liquid flow communication with a column of liquid 34 within the second conduit 22 and thereby effectively serves as a continuation of the column 34. Means are provided for bubbling the vapor 24 upwardly through the lift tube 30 so as to produce a force which lifts the cooled liquid 12 from the heat exchanger 16 via a recycling conduit 36 te a position above the heat collector 14. As illustrated, the bubbling means includes a passage 58 from the heat collector 14 to a top end 39 of the column 30. As shown in Fig. 1A, bubbles of hot vapor e.g. steam alternate in the tube 30 with short columns of the liquid 12 e.g. water .The top end 39 of the column 34 is in gas flow communication, via a top portion 40 of a condenser 41, with the heat collector 14.Above the heat collector 14, a condenser 41 is arranged for receiving the cooled liquid 12 which passes upwardly through the liquid column 34 and for condensing the vapor 24 by requiring it to pass through condenser tubing 42 which is below the surface of the liquid 12 within the condenser 41. A dam 44 serves to retain sufficient of the liquid 12 in the condenser 41 so as to properly cover sufficient of the tubing 42 to accomplish the condensing function on the vapor 24. A conduit 46 serves to conduct the liquid 12, after it has passed over the dam 44, to the heat collector 14. A further dam 47 defines, with the condenser 41, a reservoir 48 into which passes the cooled liquid 12 from the lift tube 30.The heat exchange tubing 42 is within the reservoir 48 and is connected to receive the vapor 24 which leaves the lift tub 30 via en entrance 50 of the tubing 42. The condensate within the heat exchange tubing 42 is delivered via an exit 52 therefrom to the solar heat collector 14 via the conduit 46 as illustrated.The dam 44 serves to prevent the cooled liquid 12 from being conducted by the conduit 46 from the reservoir 48 to the solar heat collector 14 unless at least a selected amount of the cooled liquid 12, namely enough to go over the dam 44, is in the reservoir 48 to keep a normal level 45 .Fig. 1A shows the position of the liquid 12 when the liquid is being moved up the lift tube 30. Fig. 1B indicates the situation which exists when the fluid passing through the piping 18 in the heat exchanger 18 has been heated to its desired temperature. In such an instance, heat is not sufficiently dissipated into the fluid flowing through the piping 18, and so pressure is built up within the condenser 41. To dissipate this, there is optionally provided an overload cooling chamber 56 which can communicate via end 57 of a tube 54 from the condenser 41.In the overload cooling chamber 56, the Vapor 24 is cooled sufficiently to condense it, whereupon it flowr downwardly through another end tube 55 and then passes via the reservoir 48, over the dam 44 and through the conduit 46 and into the collector 14. A perforate tubular member 58 is positioned within tube 54 to prevent flow stoppage. Excess heat is thereby automatically dissipated from cooling fins 53.A lower end 59 of the second conduit 22 is beneath a surface 60 of a pool 61 of the liquid 12 and the surface 60 is exposed to the atmosphere e.g. via a passage 62.An expanded portion 63 of the conduit serv es to receive the liquid 12 in the overheated condition shown inFig. 1B. The pressure exerted on the surface 60 is atmospheric pressure, whereas the pressure exerted at the tcp 39 of the column of liquid 34 is reduced below atmospheric pressure due to the column 34. Thus, a reduced pressure is provided within the system 10. This reduced pressure allows the liquid 12 to be boiled at a temperature below the temperature at which it would normally boil at atmospheric pressure. This temperature can be the maximum desired temperature of the liquid 12.Generally, the length of the column 34 is adjusted to be about 7.25 metres if the liquid 12 is water. The water then boils at an absolute pressure of about 0.255 bars, corresponding to about 66 C. As the height of column 34 decreases during operation, the boiling temperature increases, providing a self adjusting feature. The rate of pumping likewise automatically adjusts dependent on the differential teA erature between piping 18 and collector 14. External controls are, thus, unnecessary. The fluid passing through the tubing 18 is heated to about the reduced pressure boiling teperature. The top end 39 of the column 34 within the second conduit 22 is in communication with the solar heat collector 14 via the condenser 41 and thus maintains a lowered pressure therein in the manner just disclosed.Referring now to Fig. 2, there is shown an embodiment in accordance with the present invention wherein a column 64 of the liquid 12 is located within a conduit 65 and extends from above the solar heat collector 14, namely from a top surface 66 thereof, downwardly to the heat exchanger 16 at a lower end 68 of the column 64.In this embodiment, a top end 70 of a lift tube 70 is in liquid flow communication with the top end 66 of the column 64 in the conduit 65. In particular, as liquid 12 flows out of the top end 70 of the lift tube 30 , it falls downwardly and becomes a part of the column 64.Meanwhile, a bottom end 72 of the lift tube 30 is in liquid flow communication with the solar heat collector 14 via a passage 74. Vapor 24, which is produced by boiling within the solar heat collector 14, passes via a passage 76 into a small chamber 78, wherein it lifts the warm liquid 12 which passes through the passage 74 upwardly through the lift tube 30 . This creates flow, as shown by the downward arrow in the column 64 this flow causes warm liquid to flow into the heat exchanger 16 wherein the piping 18, and thereby the fluid therein, is heated. Because of this percolation, flow proceeds downwardly via recycling conduit 36 and therefore upwardly through a conduit 80 and thence into a right hand chamber 82 in the condenser 41.From the right hand chamber 82 the liquid flows leftwardly into the reservoir 48 while the vapor flows through the tubing 42 and is condensed as in the embodiment of Fig. IA. The other portions of the embodiment of Fig. 2 work in substantially the same manner as the embodiment ofFig. IA. Fig. 3 shows a fragment of Figs. IA and 1B, wherein the opening 62 has been closed by a cap 67, after the system has been installed. This provides a closed system having a permanent internal vacuum in the spaces 24 and 62 and enables the liquid lZ2 to halve any desired compositIon, e.g comprising ethylene glycol. The columns 34 and 36 can thereby be made as short as desired, allowing the system to be more compact, whilst still providing selected reduced pressure within the collector 14.In setting up the system of any embodiment, almost all air must be removed from within the system before it is filled with the water or other liquid 12.The collector 14 can in all embodiments be simply constructed from two sheets of corrugated metal e.g.aluminium , sealed together at their edges, the corrugations running in directions differing by 900 in the two sheets, so that internal ribs are thereby provided which prevent collapse of the collector due to the external atmospheric pressure. A suitable internal volume of liquid 12 therein is 1 litre.Fig. 5 illustrates an embodiment wherein a classical heat exchanger is not part of the system, but wherein instead the liquid 12 in the system circulates through a liquid filled pool 100, which, in a sense, serves as a heat exchanger as well as an exchanger of the liquid 12.The pumping action is identical to that of the embodiment of Fig. 3. A lift tube 30 lifts warm liquid 12 from the solar heat collector 14 to a top end 66 of a liquid column 64 . Flow then occurs downwardly through a conduit 65 and enters the pool 100 below a surface 102 of the liquid 12 therein. A lift tube 30 lifts cold water from a different and distant position in the pool 100, via a column 34 to the condenser 41. Thus, double pumping action is attained.The length of the columns 74 and 64 will normally be approximately 7.25 m so that liquid water 12 will boil at about 660C, but the columns 34 and 64 could be made long enough to reduce the boiling temperature of the liquid 12 to precisely the temperature desired for the liquid 12 when it is in the pool 100. For example, the columns 34 and 64 can be made long enough to provide a temperature for the water 12 of 320C. This will then serve as the limit or upper temperature which the pool 100 can attain.While two lift tubes 30 and 30 are shown in Fig. 52 only one of these is absolutely necessary, although, of course, the pumping efficiency will be reduced if only one of the lift tubes DOt and 30 is utilized.In operating the apparatus of Fig. 1, water 17 at ambient temperature e.g. 15 C can be used to initially enter tubing 18 of the heat exchanger if this tubing is part of a domestic hot water supply, the temperature of that water will be raised until it is all hot, say at 700C. Then if no hot water is drawn off, the level 60 of the cool circulating liquid 12 rises from the level shown in Fig. 1A to that shown in Fig. 1B, since as the steam in the condenser piping 42 cannot condense, the degree of vacuum decreases. A maximum boiling temperature within the collector 14 of 680C is reached.The system operates most efficiently to heat a liquid over a temperature difference of 35 to 75 C degrees.If thought desirable, a safety valve or conduit can be provided to vent any dangerous excess vapor pressure with the system.The invention is particularly useful for providing a solar heating system for use in homes to provide hot water therefor through heat exchange to a hot water system, and for use in heating swimming pools or other recreational pools. The solar heating system is particularly advantageous in that it requires no external power to provide the pumping action and in that the working fluid can be non toxic, preferably simply pure water, thus preventing any problems created by leakage between the solar heating system and the fluid heated thereby generally also water . The solar heating system 10 is self adjusting and it is not necessary to cover or uncover any parts of it to control its proper operation. Cycling of the liquid in the system is continuous rather than intermittent. Further, the solar heating system can be made quite compact, particularly in the embodiment of Fig. 3.In the present invention the means c for keeping the reduced pressure inside the collector is a means which does not include a pump or otherwise require external energy but which purely relies on atmospheric pressure and or hydrostatic pressure,
