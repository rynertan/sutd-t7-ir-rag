# Microwave monolithic integrated circuit device.

## Abstract
A microwave monolithic integrated circuit MMIC device comprises a transistor E,B,C and a capacitor C3 which are respectively formed on the same semiconductor substrate 41 . The transistor has at least one high resistivity semicon ductor layer 42 which forms a heterojunction with the semiconductor substrate 41 . The capacitor C3 has a dielectric layer constituted by the high resistivity semicon ductor layer 42 of the transistor. The transistor and the capacitor can be built by the same production processes.
