# Derivatives of 4 desacetyl indole dihydroindole alkaloids.

## Abstract
Derivatives of a 3 carboxyhydrazide of a dimeric indoledihydroindole alkaloids are useful as anti tumor agents, or in the preparation of such agents. The 3 carboxyhydrazide has the formula V NH NH CO X CO Z I in which V is a dimeric indole dihydroindole alkaloid radical of formula II CHEM wherein R 2 is H, CH3 or CHO when R 4 and R 5 are taken singly, R 5 is H, and one of R 3 and R 4 is ethyl and the other is H or OH when R 4 and R 5 are taken together with the carbons to which they are attached, they form an oxirane ring in which case R 3 is ethyl and R 7 is H, C1 3 alkyl CO or chloro substituted C1 3 alkyl CO X is C1 4 straight chain alkylene, C2 8 branched chain alkylene, C2 4 alkenylene, C2 4 alkynylene, C3 6 cycloalkylene, phenylene, or a direct bond and Z is NH2, NH NH2, OH, O C1 3 alkyl, an activating group, or a carboxy protecting group or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Immunoglobulin conjugates derived from the above are also disclosed.
