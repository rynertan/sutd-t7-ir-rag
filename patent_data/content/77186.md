# APPARATUS FOR PRODUCING CORRUGATED BOARD

## Abstract
Apparatus 1 for bonding together ples 5 ,6 of corru gated board 4 during manufacture thereof has an upstream heating section 2 and a downstream traction section 3 . The upstream section 2 has means 8 e.g. steam chests for heating the board 4 during its passage through the upstream section 2 . The downstream section 3 has first and second endless belts 12, 13 which do not extend into the heating section 2 . The belts 12, 13 have facing runs between which the board 4 may be held and the downstream section 3 has means 12a, 13a e.g. air plenums for pressing the facing runs of the first and second belts 12, 13 towards each other to hold the board therebetween.
