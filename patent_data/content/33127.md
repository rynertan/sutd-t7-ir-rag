# Center tracking welder unit with floating reference.

## Abstract
A floating reference voltage is generated in response to the low frequency components of weld current and is utilized in the control of the width of travel of a welding arc back and forth across a gap to be filled with weld metal. The arc current is integrated during each traverse across the gap and this integral is compared with the floating reference so that as the wall of the gap is approached, the direction of travel of the arc will be reversed. Follow up control affords a start up phase comparing the integration product with a fixed reference vol tage and transferring the comparison to the floating reference voltage upon the latter obtaining a conditional given value. Provision is made for avoidance of the effects of the arc weld ing phenomenon of dip transfer .

## Description
CENTER TRACRIt1G WELDER UNIT WITH FLOATING REFERENCETECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to automatic welding and more particularly to the generation and utilization of a floating reference in the control of the width of travel of a welding arc back and forth across a gap to be filled with weld metal. BACKGROUND ART In Applicant s prior U.S. Patent 4,158,124, a system is disclosed in which a welding arc is caused to weave back and forth across a gap to be filled with weld metal.In that system the arc current is integrated during each traverse across the gap and the integral of the current is compared with a reference so that as the wall of the gap is approached on a given traverse, the direction of travel of the arc will be reversed before the arc encounters the sidewall. As the arc then moves back in the other direction across the gap, the arc current is again integrated and the direction of travel reversed as the arc reaches proximity to the other wall. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION The present invention represents an improvement over the system shown in U.S. Patent 4,158,124 in that means are provided for the generation of a floating reference dependent upon the current in the arc. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS FIGURE 1 is a schematic diagram illustrating the generation and utilization of a floating point reference for the system of U.S. Patent No. 4,158,124. DETAILED DESCRIPTION FIGURE 1 illustrates in circuit diagram form a system for the generation and utilization of a floating point reference to be applied in the system shown in FIGURE 3 of U.S. Patent 4,158,124. Generally, in these figures generator G is connected to terminal 19 which represents the arc. Shunt 122 is connected at one terminal to generator G and at the other terminal to ground, and thus the weld current flows through the shunt 122. In accordance with the present invention, the voltage across shunt 122, which varies in dependence upon the magnitude of the weld current, is utilized to supply a signal on line 20, FIGURE 1 hereof, which leads to integrator 123 of U.S. Patent 4,158,124, and to supply on line 21, FIGURE 1 hereof, either a fixed reference or a floating reference which is applied to one terminal of comparator 126 of U.S. Patent 4,158,124. In generating the signal applied to the integrator by way of line 20, provision is made for avoidance of the effects of a phenomenon known as the dip transfer effect . Thus, the system of the present invention performs new functions, including a avoiding dip transfer effects b providing the generation of a floating point reference and c interrelating the system for start up based upon a fixed reference. Referring now in detail to FIGURE 1 hereof, lines 22 and 23 are connected by way of a decoupling circuit comprised of resistor 24 and capacitor 25 through a gate 26 to a sample and hold circuit 27 which comprises a capacitor 28 and resistor 29. It will be noted that conductor 23 is at ground or a common reference point.The switch or gate 26 is operated in such a manner that the weld current input is applied to the sample and hold circuit when there is no dip transfer. Adore particularly, and characteristic of consumable arc welding, the tip of the consullable electrode periodically, at a rate of about 100 Hz, makes contact with the molten pool, thus placing an abrupt repeated or periodic load on generator G. rrnally, generator G will produce an output voltage of the order of 15 volts. However, when there is a contact of the welding tip with the molten batch, the added load causes the generator voltage to decrease down to around 3 to 5 volts. Switch gate 26 is operated as to be conductive only when the welding tip is not in contact with the molten pool. The dip transfer effects are eliminated by supplying a voltage from generator G through Zener diode 30 and resistor 31 to the input of a transistor 32. The collector of transistor 32 is connected by way of NAD gate 33, capacitor 34, inverter 35 and inverter 36 to the control input of gate 26. The circuit involving transistor 32 renders gate 26 conductive so long as the output voltage fro generator G is significantly above the 3 to 5 volt level. Gate 26 is rendered non conductive when the generator voltage drops to the 3 to 5 volt level.The emitter circuit of transistor 32 includes resistor 37 connected to the base, the parallel circuit 3 leading to reference line 23 and resistor 39 leading to a supply terminal. The circuit comprising resistor 24 and capacitor 25 serves to delay rendering gate 26 conductive by a time interval of about 0.6 milliseconds following recovery of the voltage from generator G to its high level. This avoids the effects of the current build up, which might otherwise affect the integration voltage if gate 26 were rendered conductive immediately upon change in the voltage level of generator G. The voltage from the sample and hold circuit 27 is applied to an isolating buffer amplifier 40. The output of buffer amplifier 40 is a function of the weld current minus the excursions caused by dip transfer, and is applied by way of conductor 20 to the integrator system 123 of U.S. Patent 4,158,124, more particularly through resistor 124a of FIGURE 3 of said patent. The output voltage from buffer amplifier 40 is also applied to a filter amplifier 41, providing filtering having a roll off at about 3 Hz and providing amplification of the signal level by a factor of about 200. The output of filter amplifier 41 is a function of weld current minus dip transfer mode components and high frequency components. The output of amplifier 41 is applied by way of conductor 42 to a transfer switch circuit 43 comprised of a Zener diode 44 and a transistor 45 having in its base circuit a resistor 46 connected between diode 44 and resistor 37. Resistor 47 is connected between diode 44 and resistor 46 to the base of transistor 45. Capacitor 48 is connected between the base and the emitter of transistor 45. The collector of transistor 45 is connected by way of line 49 and through inverter 50 to the control input of a gate 51, and is connected directly, without inversion, to the control input of a second gate 52. A fixed reference 53 is connected by way of resistor 54 to the input of gate 52. The output of amplifier 41 is connected to the input of gate 51. The output of amplifier 41 represents a filtered average of the weld current during such times as the voltage from generator G is at its high level, which, because of the operation of gate 26, is rendered free from the effect of operation of the welding unit in the dip transfer mode. The output of gate 51 is connected by way of conductor 55 to the output conductor 21 which leads to the level control for the integrator. rlore particularly, conductor 21 is connected directly to the upper end of the potentiometer resistor 128 in FIGURE 3 of U.S. Patent 4,158,124. By means of gates 51 and 52, the operation of the system is automatically switched from the start up condition where the fixed reference from source 53 is effective gate 52 conductive and gate 51 non conductive to the run condition with the floating reference from amplifier 41 effective gate 51 conductive and gate 52 non conductive . Once the system is started up and the conductivity of transistor 45 is switched by reason of a build up of a voltage across the capacitor 48, then during the remainder of the operation, gate 51 is conductive and gate 52 is nonconductive. It is recognized that various alternatives and modifications are possible within the scope of the invention.
