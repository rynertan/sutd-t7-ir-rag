# Vehicle transmission.

## Abstract
An off highway vehicle has a continuously variable ratio transmission 15 of the rolling traction type. In order to produce forward reverse and geared neutral, an epicyclic gear 12 sums the output of the transmission 10 , taken via epicyclic gear 13 which steps the output down, with the input 1 to the transmission. Depending on their relative speeds, the output 14 produces forward, reverse or geared neutral. Epicyclic gear 13 only acts as a step down when its carrier for the planets 13b is locked. The carrier can be released in order to declutch the transmission. The arrange ment offers the advantage of compactness and of a true neutral.

## Description
VEHICLE TRANSMISSIONThis invention relates to vehicle transmissions, and especially to vehicle transmissions of the continuously variable ratio kind.The invention provides a transmission system which comprises an input shaft for connection to any engine output shaft, a rolling traction toroidal race continuously variable ratio transmission driven by the input shaft, a first simple epicyclic gear comprising a sun gear planetary gears on a carrier and an annulus, for combining drives taken from the input shaft and the output of the continuously variable ratio transmission, and a second simple epicyclic gear comprising a sun gear planetary gears on a carrier and an annulus, one part of which can be locked relative to the transmission system casing, and which in connected so as to provide a step up or a step down for one of the drives before they are combined at the first simple epicyclic gear when the said part of the second epicyclic gear is locked, the transmission being declutched when the said part of the epicyclic gear is released. A simple epicyclic gear is used to combine the drive of the input with that of the continuouslyvariable ratio transmission to produce forward reverse and geared neutral. The engine to which the trsansmission is connected will have a preferred range of speeds, and the continuously variableratio transmission will also have a preferred range of speeds, and it may therefore be desired to combine them in a ratio which cannot be conveniently provided by a simple epicyclic gear.To permit the use of a simple epicyclic gear for such combination, a second epicyclic gear is used as a step up or step down as appropriate. In accordance with the invention, a part of the second epicyclic gear can be selectively released to declutch the transmission system. This can be done in certain circumstances as a safeguard to protect the transmission and or engine.Thus for example, the release could take place when the engine oil pressure falls below a certain value. This will ensure that the transmission system is declutched when the engine is switched off. Otherwise, damage could take place if the vehicle was towed since the engine would be stationary and the transmission would be driven by the wheels, and the continuously variable ratio transmission could not adjust ratio accordingly since the hydraulic pressure necessary for its operation is derived from the engine.The release may take place when brake fluid pressure rises above a certain value. Damage could otherwise occur if the brakes were locked, since this could happen in as little as l lOth second whereas the continuously variable ratio transmission could take something in the region of 1 4 or 1 2 second to adjust to geared neutral.A manual control for releasing the releasable part of the second epicyclic gear may also be provided.The said releasable part of the second epicyclic gear could be locked bs meant of a brake band, but is preferably locked by means of a multi plate clutch.Preferably, the first epicyclic gear is connected as follows sun driven by input shaft carrier driven from output of continuously variable ratio transmission via second epicyclic gear annulus forming output of transmission system. The second epicyclic is preferably connected as follows sun to output of continuously variable ratio transmission carrier capable of being locked annulus forming output to first epicyclic gear.A transmission system constructed in accordance with the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a schematic view of the transmission system andFigure 2 is a schematic view of a continuouslyvariable ratio transmission of the rolling traction type which forms a part of the transmission system of Figure 1.The transmission system is designed for an offhighway vehicle, in which forward and reverse speeds are expected o be silaL The venice is powered by a diesel engine.The transmission system includes a continuouslyvariable ratio transmission of the rolling traction type. Such transmissions are described, for example, in Paper No 80 C2 DET 59 of the AmericanSociety of Mechanical Engineers and the Applicants Patent Application Nos 81 32125. Referring toFigure 2, the transmission has a shaft 1 bearing two opposed toroidal races 1, 3 and a double sided toroidal race 4, 5 between which rollers 6 9 transmit torque. The output is taken by means of a sleeve 10 coupled to the double sided race 4, 5.The drawing is schematic in that race 2 can be displaced in an axial direction along shaft 1 although it rotates with it in order to alter the end load pressure that forces the rollers into contact with their races. Also, there are three rollers between each pair of races so only one would be visible in a true section through the transmission. Speed ratio is varied by displacing the rollers in such a way that they steer to different inclinations. The metal surfaces of the races and roller are completely separated by an oil film which transmits torque by the elasto hydrodynamic phenomenon.A zero transmission ratio is not possible with the transmission of Figure 2 alone, and so it is combined with another drive obtained from the same input by means of an epcyclic gear. The input shaft 11 connected to the diesel engine rotates at a maximum speed of 2000 rpm. Gears lla, llb step this speed up to about 3000 rpm maximum at the shaft 1. The output 10 from the continuouslyvariable ratio transmission, indicated by the numeral 15 in Figure 1, rotates faster or slower, depending on the inclination of the rollers.A first simple epicyclic gear 12 combines a direct input from the shaft 1 with the output of the continuously variable ratio transmission 10 which is stepped down by means of a second epicyclic gear 13, the carrier of which can be locked. The final output 14 from the first epicyclic gear rotates in either direction or is stationary, depending on the relative speeds of sleeve 10 and shaft 1.Shaft 1 is connected to the sun gear 12a of the first epicyclic gear, the stepped down output 10 is connected to the carrier of the planets 12b and the output 14 is taken from the annulus 12c. The output 10 is connected to the sun 13a of the second epicyclic gear 13, the carrier of the planets 13b is lockable to the transmission system casing, and the output to the first epicyclic gear 12 is taken from the annulus 13c.The carrier of the planets 13b is lockable by means of a multiplate clutch not shown which when locked holds the carrier stationary relative to the transmission system casing. When the clutch is off, the carrier can rotate freely, and the output 14 becomes decoupled from the input 1 The epicyclic gear 13 serves the dual purpose of stepping down the speed of the output sleeve 10 to such a value that a simple epicyclic gear 12 can be used to combine the output 10 and the input 1 in a desired ratio, while enabling the whole transmission to be declutched when desired. Further the two epicyclic gears 12, 13 are arranged concentrically and thus in a space saving manner, and in a way which minimises power losses.The clutch mechanism is arranged to be released when a engine oil pressure fails b hydraulic brake pressure reaches a certain value and c by means of a manual control.A microprocessor can be used to control the transmission as well as engine speed, as has been proposed before see for example the ASME paper referred to or British Patent Application No 81 32 125 . However the transmission for the off highway vehicle described is simpler than in the examples referred to above, in that the transmission has only one operating regime. A simpler control system is therefore possible. In British Patent Application No 81 32 125 two rams are employed for generating the pressures which control the transmission ie for controlling the inclination of the rollers 6 9 and the end loading pressures between the races 2, 3 . The pressures are generated in those rams under the control of a microprocessor. In the simpler system referred to, the pressure in each ram is generated by pressure in a respective foot pedal in the vehicle. Thus, the driver presses one pedal to control forward torque and the other to control reverse torque. A separate control is necessary for engine speed.The reverse pedal can be applied when the vehicle is travelling forwards to apply braking torque, but this could in certain circumstances transfer energy from the vehicle to the engine at such a high rate as to risk damaging the vehicle engine.
