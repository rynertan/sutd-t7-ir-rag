## Description
The present invention relates to a single tube color imaging apparatus having a striped color filter and more particularly to an apparatus which eliminates the problem associated with variation of beam scanning speed resulting from electrostatic potential differences between dark and bright areas on a photoelectrical conversion target. In a single tube color imaging apparatus, an optical image is focused through a striped color filter onto a photoelectrical conversion target to develop an electrostatic image which is scanned by an electron beam. The color filter comprises successively arranged recurrent groups of color stripes of different colors. As the beam is scanned across the target, electrostatic potential differences between sharply defined bright and dark areas affects the scanning speed of the beam. This causes the color component of the video signal to vary in phase and causes its leading and trailing edges to deviate from the corresponding edges of the luminance component. As a result, color misregistration occurs on the television screen. FR A 2212733 shows a colour imaging apparatus wherein an image is focused on a photosensitive target screen through a filter which has a plurality of recurrent groups of different colour stripes. The focussed image is converted to an electrostatic image which is scanned in rectangular raster form by an electron beam in order to generate correspondingly recurrent quartets of two luminance and two colour difference signals. When a transitory variation in the luminance signal is detected by an edge detector means, a change over signal in the form of a control signal is generated which controls the operation of the rasters decoding the colour multiplexed signals and instructs them to ignore the particular part of the quartet of multiplexed signals which is affected by the luminance transient. Thus, miscalculation of the chrominance signals may be avoided. It is therefore an object of the present invention to eliminate color misregistration which occurs at sharp transitions between dark and bright areas. According to the present invention, there is provided colour imaging apparatus wherein an optical image is focused on a photoelectrical conversion target of a color image pickup tube through a color stripe filter having a plurality of successively arranged recurrent groups of different color stripes and converted to an electrostatic image which is scanned in rectangular raster form by an electron beam to generate a luminance signal and a color multiplexed video signal, comprising The present invention will be described in further detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Referring now to Fig. 1, a color imaging apparatus according to a first embodiment of the invention includes a a color television pickup tube 1 having a pair of vertical and horizontal deflection yokes 2 and 3, a color stripe filter 4 affixed to the rear side of a transparent faceplate 5 of an evacuated envelope 7, and a photoelectrical conversion target 6 attached to the rear of the filter 4 to be scanned by an electron beam emitted from an electron gun 8. A lens 9 focuses an object scene on the surface of the target 6 through the color filter 4. A video signal is read from the photoconductive layer of the conversion target 6 and applied to a preamplifier 11. Color filter 4 comprises a plurality of recurrent groups of stripes of a first color F1 which may be one of the primary colors of blue, green and red , a second color F2 which is cyan or magenta if F1 is blue, cyan or yellow if F1 is green, or yellow or magenta if F1 is red , and transparency for passing white light. These stripes have equal width and extend vertically throughout the target 6 and successively arranged across the horizontal dimension of the target 6 with the color stripes of each group recurring at intervals T. The filter 4 has therefore a spatial frequency inversely proportional to the periodic interval T. Light passing through the color filter 4 is optically modulated by the striped color filter pattern and develops an electrostatic image on the conversion target 6 which is read by the electron beam scanned. Raster scan is provided by the horizontal and vertical yokes 2 and 3 energized by sweep currents supplied from a deflection circuit 10. For purposes of illustration, it is assumed that the first filter stripe F1 is green and the second stripe F2 is cyan. The light incident on the green stripes is removed of its red and blue components to allow its green component to pass to target 6, while the light incident on the cyan stripes is removed of the red component R to allow its green G and blue B components to pass to target 6. Therefore, if the target is illuminated with an imagewise radiation of white light equal energies at all wavelengths throughout the visible spectrum , the color multiplexed signal contains G , B G and R B G components derived respectively from stripes F1, F2 and W. Therefore, the video signal S₀ obtained from the target 6 is given by The output of preamplifier 11 is applied to a low pass filter 12 and to a band pass filter 13. Low pass filter 12 passes the luminance component of the video signal through a delay circuit 16 to a luminance output terminal Y. Low pass filter 12 has a cut off frequency lower than the carrier frequency f₁. The color carrier component of the video signal, represented by the second term of Equation 1, is passed through the band pass filter 13 to a variable delay line 15 and thence to a color output terminal 18. The output of band pass filter 13 is also coupled to a second color output terminal 19. As will be described later, the output terminals 18 and 19 are coupled to a processing circuit from which color difference signals are derived for further processing in a color matrix circuit in which they are combined with a baseband component represented by the first term of Equation 1. Delay control circuit 14 includes a differential amplifier 20 having a first input terminal coupled to the output of low pass filter 12. The second input of the differential amplifier 20 is applied from the output of low pass filter 12 through a delay circuit 21 having a constant time delay Δt₁. If the input to the delay circuit 21, which is represented by a rectangular pulse The output of band pass filter 13, which is in the form of a burst pulse If the incident optical image has a dark area 30 surrounding a brighter area 31 as shown in Fig. 3 and is scanned in the direction of arrow 32, the path of electrons impinging on the target will be slightly bent rightward as they approach a transition 33 from dark area 30 to bright area 31 by an increasing potential gradient produced between them. As the beam crosses a transition 34 from bright area 31 to darker area 30 it will be slightly bent leftward by a potential gradient which decays as the impinging electrons recede from transition 34. These scanning speed variations cause the color signal burst to be advanced in phase on its leading edge and retarded in its trailing edges as indicated by a waveform Variable delay line 15 is adjusted such that when the output voltage of waveshaper 22 is zero the pulse burst Fig. 4 is an illustration of one example of the processing circuit in which the color signals from the output terminals 18 and 19 of Fig. 1 are processed to derive color difference signals. Processing circuit includes a field memory 41 to store a reference signal. This reference signal is derived from the signal from output terminal 19 through a read write switch 42 and an analog to digital converter 43. During a write mode which occurs prior to the normal operation of the imaging apparatus, switches 42 and 44 are manually switched to write position W and the target 6 of camera tube 1 is illuminated uniformly with light of a predetermined color to generate a carrier at frequency f₁, this carrier being digitized by A D converter 43 and written into field memory 41. A voltage controlled oscillator 45 is supplied with a standard voltage from a voltage source 48 through switch 44 to supply constant frequency clock pulses to an address generator 46. A video carrier detector 47 detects the leading edge of the carrier and enables the address generator 46 to count the clock pulses and generate address codes successively specifying the storage locations of memory 41. During normal operation, switches 42 and 44 are returned to read position R and the target 6 is illuminated with an actual optical image to produce a signal which is a carrier modulated in amplitude in accordance with the intensity off picture elements of the image and in phase in accordance with the color filter stripes of each recurrent group, as represented by the second term of Equation 1. This signal has a phase difference with respect to the carrier stored in memory 41. A frequency comparator 48 compares the frequencies of the color signal supplied from variable delay line 15 and the output of a digital to analog converter 49 and supplies a control voltage through switch 44 to the VCO 45 to read the memory 41 at a variable rate in accordance with the frequency difference detected by the frequency comparator 48. As a result, the VCO 45 is controlled to reduce the frequency difference to zero and a reference signal represented by sin ωt ϑ is generated by memory 41. Since the phase component ϑ is equal to the phase component contained in the modulated carrier , nonlinearity inherent in the deflection system 10 is compensated. The output of memory 41 is converted into analog form by D A converter 49 and fed to a phase shifter 50 where it is shifted in phase by 60 and 60 with respect to the modulated carrier and applied respectively to synchronous detectors 51 and 52 to which the output of variable delay ine 15 is also applied. Color difference signals are produced by the synchronous detectors 51 and 52 and applied to a color matrix circuit 53. A low pass filter 40 is connected to the preamplifier 11 to pass the baseband of the color multiplexed signal to the matrix circuit 53 and combined with the color difference signals to generate primary color signals, which are applied to terminals R, G and B. While the embodiment of Fig. 1 is suitable for eliminating the phase shift problem for luminance pulses with a duration longer than delay time Δt₁, it is not appropriate when the luminance pulse duration is smaller than the delay time Δt₁. Embodiments shown in Figs. 5 and 6 are appropriate for this purpose. In Fig. 5 wherein the same numerals are used to designate parts corresponding to those in Fig. 1, delay control circuit 114 includes a first pair of first in last out CCD charge coupled device line memories 51 and 52 and a pair of electronic switches 53 and 54. The luminance signal from low pass filter 12 is alternately coupled by switch 53 to line memories 51 and 52 and the outputs of memories 52 and 51 are alternately coupled by switch 54 to an integrator 55. The connections of switches 53 and 54 to memories 51 and 52 are alternated under control of the output of a T flip flop 56 in response to horizontal sync pulses from sync source 57, so that when each line memory is in a write mode the other is in a read mode. The output of integrator 55 is alternately coupled by a switch 58 to first in last out CCD line memories 61 and 62, the outputs of memories 61 and 62 being alternately coupled by a switch 59 to a first in first out CCD frame memory circuit 63 in opposite fashion to switch 58 under control of the output of flip flop 56. The function of the memories 51 and 52 is to store luminance signals at alternate line scans and reverse the order of occurrence of the individual luminance pulses of each line scan, so that if luminance pulses 1a, 1b and 1c are generated in sequence they will appear in opposite order as indicated by rectangular pulses 1c, 1b and 1a in Fig. 7. Pulses 1c, 1b, 1a are integrated by integrator 55 so that the leading and trailing edges of each pulse become exponential. Memories 61 and 62 have the same function as memories 51 and 52, so that the output pulses of integrator 55 are reversed in the order of their occurrences and fed to frame memory 63 in the same order as they are developed from the conversion target 6. Therefore, when the stored pulses are read from frame memory 63 in the next frame, the knee of the rising edge and the foot of the falling edge of these pulses will be respectively time coincident with the leading and trailing edges of luminance pulses 1a , 1b and 1c which are supplied from low pass filter 12 during the corresponding line scan of the next frame as shown in Fig. 7. These coincidences occur due to the inherent correlation between successive frames. If correlation between successive lines can be utilized, it is possible to dispense with the frame memory 63. The integrated pulses from frame memory 63 and the output of low pass filter 12 are applied to a differential amplifier 64, which detects the difference in amplitude between rectangular pulses 1a , 1b , 1c and the integrated pulses 3a, 3b, 3c, respectively, to produce pulses of opposite polarities in successive pairs 4a, 4b, 4c with each pair having an exponential leading edge. The output of low pass filter 12 is also applied to a differentiator 65, so that pulses 1a , 1b and 1c are differentiated into pulses in successive pairs 5a, 5b, 5c with each pulse having an exponential trailing edge. The outputs of differential amplifier 64 and differentiator 65 are summed in an adder 66, whereby the pulses in pairs 4a, 4b, 4c are combined with pulses in pairs 5a, 5b, 5c, respectively, to produce pulses in pairs 6a, 6b, 6c, with each pulse having exponential leading and trailing edges. The output of adder 66 controls the variable delay line 15 in a manner as described previously. Since the positive and negative peaks of each delay control voltage coincide with the leading and trailing edges of luminance pulses 1a , 1b , 1c , the output of low pass filter 12 is applied to luminance output terminal Y dispensing with the delay circuit 16. Delay control circuit 214 shown in Fig. 6 is similar to the Fig. 5 embodiment with the exception that it employs a differentiator 70 and a polarity inverter 71 instead of the integrator 55 and differential amplifier 64 of the previous embodiment. As shown in Fig. 8, luminance pulses 1C, 1B and 1A from the memories 51, 52 are differentiated by differentiator 70 to produce pulses in pairs 1C, 1B and 1A which are reversed in polarity by inverter 71 to produce pulses in pairs 3C, 3B, 3A. Pulses 3C, 3B, 3C are reversed in the order of occurrence by memories 61 and 62 and stored into frame memory 63 to form pulses 4A, 4B and 4C which coincide with luminance pulses 1A , 1B and 1C of the corresponding line scan of the next frame, respectively. Adder 66 combines pulses 5A, 5B, 5C from differentiator 65 with pulses 4A, 4B, 4C from memory 63 to produce delay control voltage pulses 6A, 6B and 6C. Fig. 9 is an alternative form of the delay control circuit of Fig. 1. This embodiment includes a bipolar edge detector 90 and an integrator 91 which integrates the output of edge detector 90 and controls the variable delay circuit 15. Edge detector 90 comprises delay circuits 92 and 93 connected in series from the output of low pass filter 12. Noninverting unity gain amplifiers 94 and 96 apply the outputs of low pass filter 12 and delay circuit 93 to an adder 97. The output of delay circuit 92 is coupled to adder 97 by an inverting amplifier 95 having a gain twice as high as the amplifiers 94 and 96. Each of the delay circuit 92 and 93 has a delay time Δt. As shown in Fig. 10, luminance pulse Since output pulses In Fig. 11, the output of the bipolar edge detector 90 is applied to one input of a differential amplifier 100. The second input of differential amplifier 100 is received from the output of a frequency comparator 101 which compares the frequency of the output of bond pass filter 13 with the frequency of the output of a frequency converter 102. The output of adder 100 controls the frequency of a voltage controlled oscillator 103 which in turn controls the output frequency of frequency converter 102. As in the embodiment of Fig. 4, the photoelectrical conversion target of camera tube 1 is uniformly illuminated with light of a predetermined color to generate a carrier prior to normal operation of the imaging apparatus. The carrier is passed through the band pass filter 13 to a frequency converter 104 where it is reduced in frequency by mixing it with a local oscillator signal from source 105. The frequency converted carrier is applied through mode select switch 106 to A D converter 107 and thence to field memory 108. The capacity of memory 108 is only needed in the amount that is smaller than is otherwise required to store the carrier if the frequency reduction is not performed. Read write operations of memory 108 are controlled by address generator 109 which is clocked by oscillator 110 when enabled by video carrier detector 111. The carrier is read out of memory 108 into D A converter 112 during normal operation to produce a reference signal. Reference signal is fed to frequency converter 102 which reconverts it to the original frequency. The frequency difference detected by comparator 101 is reduced to zero by feeding back the output of converter 102 to frequency converter 101, so that the reference signal coincides in frequency with the modulated carrier from band pass filter 13 which is affected by the nonlinearity of the deflection system. In addition to the nonlinearity compensation, the output of bipolar edge detector 90 controls the VCO 103 to compensate for the phase variations resulting from the beam s transitory scanning speed variations. The output of frequency converter 102 is applied to phase shifter 113. As in Fig. 4, phase shifter 113 supplies a pair of phase shifted reference signals to synchronous detectors 114 and 115 which combine them with the output of band pass filter 13 to supply color difference signals to matrix circuit 116 where they are combined with the baseband of the video signal supplied from low pass filter 117. Further alternative embodiments of Fig. 1 are illustrated in Figs. 12 and 13. In Fig. 12, delay control circuit 14A is similar to delay control circuit 14 with the exception that it additionally includes a delay circuit 23 having a delay time equal to one scan line period minus Δt₂. Therefore, the output of delay circuit 23 indicated by a pulse In Fig. 13, the delay control circuit 14A is used to control the scanning speed of the electron beam, rather than to control the delay time of the color video signal. In this modification, the output of waveshaper 22 is applied to a pair of horizontal deflection plates 24. These deflection plates may either be the normal horizontal deflection plates of a camera tube or extra deflection plates provided in a camera tube of the electromagnetic deflection type. The control voltage impressed on deflection plates 24 counteracts on the sweeping electron beam to momentarily decrease the scanning speed as it approaches a dark to bright transition and momentarily increase the speed as it leaves a bright to dark transition.
