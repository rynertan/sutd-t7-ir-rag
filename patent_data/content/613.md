# Cathode ray tube storage device with an electroluminescent display panel.

## Abstract
A cathode ray tube storage device has a display panel 26 incorporated in which is a layer of electroluminescent material which exhibits hysteresis characteristics. An a.c. voltage source 28 is connected to apply a bias a.c. field across the electroluminescent layer, the RMS value of which lies between the extinction and threshold values for the material. A charge pattern representing information to be displayed is written on the panel 26 by an electron beam 42 from an electron gun 14 as a result of which corresponding areas of the electroluminescent material are excited to produce a light output. The intensity of the light output varies with the intensity of the exciting electron beam 42. The electroluminescent layer can be either directly excited by the electron beam, or by a light output produced by electron beam radiation of an intervening layer of cathodoluminescent material also incorporated in the panel 26.
