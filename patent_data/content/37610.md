# An arrangement for damping and absorption of sound in rooms.

## Abstract
An arrangement for damping and absorption of sound in rooms. The purpose of the invention is to provide a sound damping even at very low frequencies e.g. 50 Hz and simul taneously improve speech comprehension in the entire room by reduction of the resonance time. Another purpose is to be able to vary the acoustic absorption and in that way even vary the resonance time over the entire part of the frequency area. This has been achieved by the fact that the sound absorbents 14 in the form of plates mats or similar are arranged at an angle with at least one corner area 11 formed by the walls 12 and ceiling 13 of the room in the corner area 11 behind the absorbent 14 an air volume is trapped so that the absorbent due to the sound influence has a membrane effect. The incli nation and for position of each absorbent 14 can be varied individually or in group.
