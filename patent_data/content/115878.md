# Battery casing and method of making same.

## Abstract
A battery casing construction 10 comprises an extruded casing wall member 18 upper and lower collars 19, 20 which are snugly received on the wall member 18 and bonded thereto adjacent the upper and lower ends thereof and top and bottom plate elements 26, 28 which are received in covering relation on the upper and lower ends of the well member 18 , respectively, and bonded thereto. The extruded wall member 18 can be constructed with a reduced wall thickness to make the casing light weight and save on material costs whereas the collars 19, 20 and plate elements 26, 28 provide strength at the ends of the casing 10 where it is needed. The method forming the casing 10 comprises the steps of forming the extruded wall member 18 , forming the plate elements 26, 28 and collars 19, 20 , assembling the plate elements 26, 28 and collars 19, 20 on the wall member 18 and bonding the plate elements 26, 28 and collars 19, 20 to the wall member 18 .
