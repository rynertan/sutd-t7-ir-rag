# Countercurrent contact process and apparatus.

## Abstract
The invention concerns a process for contacting a particu late solid phase with a liquid phase by passing the phases countercurrent through a vertical column 10 divided into compartments by a plurality of perforated plates 11 and having a stirring means 23 in each compartment. The inven tion further provides apparatus for the contacting process. The process and apparatus of the invention offer the advan tage of good liquid solid contact and facile control of particle residence time and are especially suitable for contacting ion exchange resins with aqueous solutions.
