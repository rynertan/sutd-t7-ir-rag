## Description
The present invention relates generally to CRT displays, and more particularly to the generation of halos around symbols therein, to distinguish the symbols from video background. Symbols are written on a CRT display which overlay background video. Referring to Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings, which is a negative of an actual display, a symbol 20 is rendered less discernable by background video 21 which surrounds and borders the symbol 20. The obfuscating effect of the background video 21 upon the symbol 20 is particularly pronounced on the right hand side of the CRT display where the symbol 20 appears to merge with the background video 21. Thus, there is a need for apparatus which precludes symbols on CRT displays from being confused with the background video. The present invention is defined in the appended claims, and a preferred embodiment of the present invention is utilised in conjunction with Applicants copending EP A 0146229. The preferred embodiment is analogous to the apparatus described above, with the following distinctions. Each memory address is identified by an In preferred embodiments of the present invention, the address reader comprises shift registers coupled to delays comprising shift registers or D type flip flops. The predetermined fraction of illumination intensity referred to above is preferably one half. That is, the intensity of the video background at the border of a symbol is preferably reduced by one half. Such a reduction in intensity creates a halo around a symbol which is black in appearance, and distinguishes the symbol from background, but which does not induce flickering. The invention will now be described in greater detail, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Identical numerals in different figures of the drawings represent similar elements. The present invention entails apparatus for generating halos around symbols on CRT displays in order to distinguish the symbols from video background. A CRT display is coupled to an image memory. A picture element in the CRT display is illuminated as symbology if the corresponding address in the image memory contains a video bit signal of 1 . The picture element is not illuminated as symbology if the corresponding address in the image memory contains a video bit signal of 0 . The picture element with which the beam generator of the CRT display is currently aligned may be denoted P The above procedure may be described mathematically. The dimming status, denoted DS, of the intensity of the video background illumination at the currently aligned picture element P The B The zero value for DS indicates that the intensity of the video background illumination at the currently aligned picture element P and thus, DS 1. The 1 value for DS indicates that the intensity of the video background illumination at the picture element P Thus, the dimming status, DS, of the intensity of the video background illumination at the currently aligned picture element P Referring to Figure 3, the above expression may be implemented as follows. A coordinator 40, coupled to a CRT display 41, generates coordinates, and aligns the beam generator of the CRT display with the picture elements corresponding to the generated coordinates. The coordinator 40 is also coupled to an address reader 42 which is coupled to an image memory 43. The address reader 42, in response to a signal from the coordinator 40 indicating the coordinate of the picture element with which the beam generator is currently aligned, reads from the image memory 43 the video bit signals in the nine addresses associated with the currently aligned picture element. That is, denoting, as before, the currently aligned picture element as P A background video generator 46 is coupled to the coordinator and produces background video signals corresponding to the coordinates provided by the coordinator 40. Each background video signal is designed to produce a predetermined intensity of illumination in a corresponding picture element. A background video dimmer 45 receives, from the background video generator 46, a background video signal corresponding to the currently aligned picture element P Referring to Figure 4, in a preferred embodiment of the invention the address reader comprises shift registers and delays. A shift register 50 is loaded in parallel, with the video bit signal B After action by the delays 66 and 67, video bit signals from the shift registers 50, 55 and 60 having the same Referring to Figure 5, the Boolean processor 44 comprises a nine input OR gate 120 for receiving the video bit signals B The present invention may be utilised with the invention disclosed in Applicants copending European Patent Application No. EP A 0146229 based on US No. 553224 referred to above and which is hereby incorporated by reference. In the arrangement of the copending application, each memory address is identified by an Mathematically, the dimming status, DS, described above, of the video background at the currently aligned picture elements P The expression is the Boolean OR sum of the video bit signals in the memory addresses corresponding to the picture elements P This corresponds to P indicating that the intensity of the background illumination at P Thus, the dimming status, DS, of the video background at P Referring again to Figure 3, the above expression may be implemented in a manner analogous to that of the previous dimming status expression. In this case, the address reader 42 reads the addresses in the image memory 43 corresponding to the sixteen central picture elements in Figure 6. The Boolean processor 44 implements the relevant expression for DS above. Referring to Figure 7, the address reader 42 utilised with this preferred embodiment of the invention is analogous to that of Figure 4. A shift register 130, having four compartments, is loaded in parallel, with the video bit signals B Referring to Figure 8, in this preferred embodiment of the invention, the Boolean processor 44 for implementing the expression Comprises a sixteen input OR gate 200 which receives the sixteen video bit signals corresponding to the first summation sign in the expression for DS, and generates the Boolean OR sum signal thereof. A four input OR gate 201 receives the four video bit signals corresponding to the second summation sign in the expression for DS, and generates the Boolean OR sum signal thereof. The output of the OR gate 201 is received by a NOT gate 202 which generates the complement thereof. The outputs of the NOT gate 202 and the OR gate 200 are received by an AND gate 203 which generates the Boolean AND product signal thereform. The output of the AND gate 203 is conveyed to the background video dimmer 45. As indicated above, this embodiment of the present invention is utilised in conjunction with the arrangement disclosed in the above mentioned copending European application . Symbols are generated in accordance with the arrangement of the copending application and halos therearound are generated in accordance with the present invention. The Boolean OR sum signal employed in the copending application may be drawn from the output of the Boolean OR gate 201 in Figure 8 of the present invention. The components of the present invention are well known in the art or readily contrived by one of ordinary skill therein. Referring back to Figure 3, the image memory 43, the coordinator 40, the background video generator 46, and the CRT display 41 are conventional, well known apparatus. The background video dimmer 45, for conveying background video signals or altering them to diminish illumination intensity, is readily contrived by one of ordinary skill in the art.
