# Apparatus for registering elevator call.

## Abstract
A group controlled elevator system in which each hall is provided with destination buttons 1A 5A that will be oper ated by passengers and that produce signals corresponding to destination floors desired by the passengers, and in which destination calls produced by the manupulated destination but tons are automatically registered for predetermined cages. When a cage other than the cage for which the destination call is automatically registered, has arrived at the floor where said destination button was operated the destination call is also registered for this non allotted cage. Therefore, whichever cage the passengers board, they are brought to their desired floors without the need of re registering their calls in the cage. Logic circuitry for effecting the described control is described.
