# Apparatus and method of producing a succession of die cut tobacco blanks.

## Abstract
A device A for supplying a succession of die cut tobacco blanks W with a given profile to a web 64,66 of a coiled type, storage bobbin 60,62 . This device comprises a set of die cut stations 20,30 each including a cutting die blade 72 with an upstanding cutting edge 74 matching the profile of the prop osed blank and vacuum means 86 surrounding the edge of the blade for capturing a tobacco sheet material on the sta tions in a position overlying the cutting edge. The stations are moved along an endless, preselected cutting path P which intersects a cutting means 100 at a first fixed position in the path of movement of the stations so that a tobacco leaf can be cut from a manually placed tobacco sheet captured on the movable station. After passing the cutting means, which includes two rolls 102, 104 generally fixed in the direction of movement of the station, the station continues in the same endless path to a transfer position at which position the cut profile W is released from the cutting station and is transfer red to an awaiting web of a coiled type storage bobbin.
