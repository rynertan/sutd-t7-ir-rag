# Aircraft flight control system.

## Abstract
An improved inner loop control is disclosed for use in an aircraft pitch axis control system. Signals representative of vertical acceleration and pitch rate are complementary filtered and summed to produce the inner loop control signal. The improved approach provides higher outer loop control law gains and better system stability, resulting in higher control bandwidth and tighter command tracking, especially in turbulence.
