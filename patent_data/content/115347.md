# Poly arylene sulfide compositions.

## Abstract
A melt blended composition comprising poly arylene sulfide and hydrogenated conjugated diene monovinyl aro matic block copolymer with the hydrogenated conjugated diene monovinyl aromatic block copolymer present in an amount of up to about 5 weight percent of the total composition. A method for increasing the crystallinity of poly arylene sulfide by melt blending therewith hydrogen ated conjugated diene monovinyl aromatic block copolymer in an amount up to about 5 weight percent of the total composition.
