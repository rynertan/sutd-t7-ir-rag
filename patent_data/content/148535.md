# Object sorting system.

## Abstract
Object sorting systems are known which use a vision based system programmed by an operator who selects those features of the object which will be used in the sorting test. In accordance with the invention, detailed feature se lection by a human programmer is avoided, the features be ing selected automatically in a system which is shown ex amples of the desired and undesired objects. Typically, a linear array camera 5 scans the objects 18 in a rectangular raster, created by the motion of the object along a track 1 and in contact with a fence 2, to generate a binarized picture of the object comprising rows and columns of binary picture elements pixels . In a learning mode, a master set of fea tures is derived as a reference set of distinguishable col umns of the picture. In the sorting mode, the corresponding set of columns of an unknown object are compared with the reference set to determine acceptance or rejection of the object.
