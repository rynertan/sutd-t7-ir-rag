# A plaything by way of describing lemniscate laps, identified by successively flashing coloured electric lights.

## Abstract
A plaything with the main characteristic that it answers essentially a twofold purpose carrying out a special waist movement for dancing or other rhythmic movements and thereby creating successively flashing coloured light effects. Both ends are attained by means of marbles 3 rotating within a lemniscate tube 2 and describing lemniscate laps to the disco music. The lemniscate tube 2 , worn round the waist or upper body by means of an elastic belt 1 with a clasp on the back or lateral side, takes shape of a recumbent eight figure with a round, square or combined transverse section. Small coloured light bulbs 4 , set in along the lemniscate tube 2 on its front or put in the marbles 3 themselves, are flashing successively through short contacts of the rotating marbles 3 with the wire system 6 on the inner back side of the tube 2 , that leads to the batteries in the battery case.

## Description
A nlaything by way of describing lemniscate laps, identified by successively flashing coloured electric lights.The invention relates to a plaything worn round a person s waist by means of a belt, while on the front side one or more marbles, put in a form of tube being made of hard plastics and having the shape of a lemniscate, are rotating within the tube, by which lemniscate laps are made and are identified by successively flashing coloured electric lights, as long as the bearer of this plaything makes specified waist movements during dancing.As far as known a rather different construction for waist movements has been supplied by a plaything named as Hula hoop , by which the bearer is making horizontally circular waist movements with a large plastic made hoop turning round the waist.An obvious disadvantage of this well known construction is the restriction of its use in exclusively big halls or open space, where users are able to move without clashing with each other. In a full house however, this plaything is assumed explicitly as being unfit.The invention as claimed is partly intended to meet tnis latter in such a way that it is carried out as practically as possible. This invention, worn round a person s waist, may solve the problem by making waist movements up and down through description of vertical lemniscate laps, by which one or more adapted metal coated marbles inside a plastic lemniscate shaped tube worn on the person s abdomen will rotate along the whole track and produce successively flashing coloured electric lights through multiple brief contacts of the marble s with both the light bulbs on the front side of the lemniscate tube and a wire system inside the tube, that leads to a source of energy, consisting of two batteries inserted in a small case at the crossing of the lemniscate tube.The advantages offered by the invention are mainly that it requires only a small elbow room for dancing, by which at the same time successively coloured electric lights are flashing to raise the festive air.One way of carrying out the invention is described below with reference to drawings which illustrate the specfic embodiments, in which Figure 1 is a front view of a plaything in accordance with the invention with a mono lemniscate figure, consisting of two laps, exclusive of the waist belt.Figure 2 is a collection of longitudinal and transverse views of the invention irrespective of the type as well as of the front view of the invention with a mono lemniscate figure with a single lap, inclusive of the waist belt.Figure 3 is a front view of the invention with two lemniscate figures, which are intertwined to each other, exclusive of the waist belt.Figure 4 is a front view of the invention with two lemniscate figures, joining together to form one complex track, exclusive of the waist belt.The figures show a plaything worn round a person s waist for dancing purposes or other rhythmic movements, comprising essentially an elastic belt 1 for the waist with a clasp on the back or lateral side and a plastic lemniscate tube 2 on the front side, fastened to the belt 1 by means of fixed rings.The lemniscate tube 2 takes shape of a recumbent eight figure. In transverse section its form may be round, square or a combination of semi circle on the front side and semisquare on the back. Longitudinally the lemniscate tube 2 consists of two plastic made components stuck together. Bengthwisely its form is rather curved in accordance with the lines of the bearer s abdomen. Through this lemniscate tube 2 one or more adapted metalcoated marbles 3 may turn round, when the bearer of this belt 1 is making a waist movement. The trick is to provide such a movement that the marbles 3 may describe a reclining eighty figure or a full lemniscate lap.Along the plastic tube 2 small coloured electric lightbulbs 4 are set in on the front side and flashed successively by two small batteries 5 through the rotations of the marbles 3 . The metal coated marbles 3 as electric conductors will take care of the multiple brief contacts in the electric circuit 6 . The electric circuit 6 consists of two wires, where the first connects the user poles of the batteries 5 with the several light bulbs 4 , while the second clung to the inner back side of the lemniscatetube 2 leads to the opposite poles of the batteries 5 .A series of brief contacts of the metal coated marbles 3 with both the bottom contact plates of the electric lightbulbs 4 and the wire system on the inner back side of the lemniscate tube 2 will produce successively flashing coloured light effects. A small battery case 5 with a built in on and off button is inserted on the back side the crossing of the lemniscate tube 2 .Another variant in the type of flashing is to put the small light bulbs a in the marbles 3 instead of along the lemniscate tube 2 . The now translucent plastic made marbles 3 are flashing lights through brief contacts with a double system of wires 6 within the tube 2 on the back side, which both lead to the different poles of the batteries 5 . The tube 2 in this case is segmented by different colours in order to produce a moving coloured effect when the marbles 3 are flashing.Variations in the embodiment of the lemniscate tube 2 can be made and are specified to differences in size small, medium and large , in number of laps one lap, two or threelaps figures 1 and in type mono and duo type . With reference to the duo type two variants can be distinguished the intertwined duo type figure 3 where two seperate lemniscate laps are intertwined around the crossings, and the confluenced duo type figure 4 , where two lemniscate laps are joining together to form one complex track.Another variant in use is the invention with a mono lemniscate figure for gymnastics and for getting physical fitness. Instead of electric light bulbs 4 and a case with batteries 5 a small enumerator is fixed to the center of the lemniscate tube 2 . This counter is driven by a system of wheels, initiated by the marble 3 moving in the tube 2 .Another variant in use is the invention with a mono lemniscate liDu.re worn by a person round the upper body. The lem niscate tube 2 is made of rather flexible plastics and equipped with adjustable parts around the crossing. A seperate X niece that constitutes the crossing of the lemnis cate tube 2 holds the sliding loops on both sides by means of perged pins. A small battery case 5 with two micro battery cells is fixed at the back side of the X piece of the tube 2 .
