# Optical transducer and measuring device.

## Abstract
An optical transducer for producing a measurement signal which is modulated in accordance with the position of a physically movable member in the form of a modulating mirror 5 and which also produces a reference signal the intensity of which is independent of the position of the modulating mirror. Both the modulating mirror 5 and a further optical element which is arranged to provide the reference signal are arranged on the optical axis along which a light beam is directed by an input lens 3 . Thus the system can tolerate normally experienced vibrations transverse to the optical axis and can provide for a substantial degree of movement of the modulating mirror.
