# Fabrication of stacked mos devices.

## Abstract
In a process for manufacturing vertically integrated MOS devices and circuits, gate oxide 24 and a gate 26 are formed on a semiconductor substrate 10 such as a silicon substrate. A layer 32 of polysilicon is then deposited over the wafer, the polysilicon contacting the substrate silicon through a window 30 in the gate oxide 24 . The substrate silicon 10 and the polysilicon 32 are then laser melted and cooled under conditions that encourage crystal seeding 55 from the substrate 10 into the polysilicon 32 over the gate 26 . Subsequently, ions are implanted into the silicon substrate 10 and the polysilicon 32 to form accurately vertically aligned source and drain regions 18, 36 and 20, 38 . By introducing the source and drain dopants after melt associated seeding of the polysilicon 32 , the risk of dopant diffusion into the device channel regions 22, 34 is avoided.
