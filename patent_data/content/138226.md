# MOBILE RADIO COMMUNICATION SYSTEM

## Abstract
In a mobile radio communication system wherein one base station and a plurality of mobile stations are located in a zone, the base station and the mobile stations communicate with each other by commonly utilizing a relatively small number of radio channels, and the base station is controlled to forcibly release a channel being used when it does not receive elec tromagnetic wave from any one of the mobile stations under communication for a predetermined interval, the transmitting apparatus of each mobile station comprises a voice detector for supplying operating power to a transmission amplifier only when transmission information is inputted to a modulator which modulates a carrier wave with the transmission informa tion and a timer for temporarily supplying the operating power to the transmission amplifier at an interval shorter than the predetermined interval. This system enables communication with saved power consumption and without erroneously releas ing a channel being used.
