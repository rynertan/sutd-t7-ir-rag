# Reinforced asphalt layer.

## Abstract
A bitumen mineral particles composition 2 layer 1 is reinforced by at least one embedded network 3 of elongated reinforcing elements 4 connected to one another where they cross. The maximum linear dimension of at least some cross sections of the elements 4 along the length thereof is of the order of a particle size characteristic of the composition for band shaped elements 15 20mm , and the orientation of said maximum linear dimension varies along the length of the elements 4 . In the finished, rolled layer 1 the elements 4 have adjusted locally to the mineral particles by deformation, and the network 3 has largely retained its elasticity. Where the elements 4 cross, their respective surfaces facing one another substantially coincide, band shaped elements are twisted, one series clockwise, the crosswise arranged series counter clockwise. Two networks 3a, 3b are embedded sub stantially directly above one another and offset diagonally to the mesh by half that mesh diagonal dimension.
