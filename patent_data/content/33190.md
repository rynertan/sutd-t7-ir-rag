# Overcurrent protection devices.

## Abstract
An overcurrent protection device includes an elec tromagnet having a current sensitive winding 11 and a vol tage sensitive winding 12 in series, and a normally closed contact 10 in parallel with the voltage sensitive winding 12. The contact 10 opens if a current determined by the current sensitive winding 11 flows and is then held open by the vol tage sensitive winding until the circuit in which it is connected is interrupted.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. An overcurrent protection device comprising an electromagnet having first and second windings and normally closed contact means openable by said electromagnet when the current through said first winding exceeds a predetermined level, said second winding being connected in parallel with said contact means and in series with said first winding. 2. A device as claimed in claim 1 in which said second winding has a relatively large number of turns of relatively fine gauge wire, so as to be capable of maintaining said contact means open whilst passing a relatively light current.

## Description
This invention relates to overcurrent protection devices intended primarily, but not exclusively for use in road vehicle electrical systems. Various types of overcurrent relay have previously been proposed including electromagnetic types and thermal types. The thermal type are readily made self resetting but tend to operate slowly. The electromagnetic type, although capable of reacting quickly to an overcurrent situation tend to be complicated and often require manual resetting. It is an object of the invention to provide an electromagnetic overcurrent protection device which is of very simple configuration and does not require manual resetting. An overcurrent protection device in accordance with the invention comprises an electromagnet having first and second windings and normally closed contact means openable by said electromagnet when the current through said first winding exceeds a predetermined level, said second winding being connected in parallel with said contact means and in series with said first winding. Thus, when the device is connected in series with a load across a supply the second winding is normally shortcircuited by the contact means. When the current exceeds the predetermined level the contact means opens, thereby cutting off the load current, but also connecting the second winding across the supply and thereby maintaining the contact means open. When the supply is disconnected, even momentarily, the device resets automatically. An example of the invention is shown in the accompanying drawing which is a circuit diagram of the device. The device shown takes the form of a relay having one pair of normally closed contacts 10 in series with a current detector winding 11 and in parallel with a voltage detector winding 12. The number of windings and the gauge of the wire used for the current winding 11 will depend on the current level at which it desired that the relay should be tripped. The voltage winding 12, generally speaking will have significantly more turns of relatively fine gauge wire, so that it can hold the contacts 10 open whilst only a relatively light current is passing through it. The device is connected, as Shown, in series with a load, in this case a plurality of lamps, 13 and a switch 14 across a supply. Since the contact 10 is normally closed, the switch 14 determines whether or not the lamps are connected to the supply. Should any lamp, or any wire connecting the switch to the lamps 13, fail and become shorted to earth, the current in winding 11 will rise above the predetermined level required to trip the relay, so that contact 10 will open, interrupting the fault current. The winding 12 will now be connected across the supply and will pass a small current required to maintain the relay tripped until the switch 14 is opened. It will be appreciated that when devices as described above are installed in a road vehicle electrical system it is not necessary to ensure that the device is in a readily accessible situation. Since the device resets automatically when there is no voltage across it, it can be situated at any position near the switch or load it is protecting.
