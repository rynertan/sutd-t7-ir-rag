# Method of receiving a compressed composite signal.

## Abstract
A compressed single side band communication system and method in which the audio signal is compressed prior to pre emphasis and thereafter summed with a pilot tone for further compression prior to transmission. Initially, only the pilot tone is transmitted at full rated power to aid in ac quisition of the signal by the receiver. Thereafter, the trans mitter ALC is disabled and the pilot tone is attenuated. The receiver adjusts the frequency characteristics of the pilot tone filter and phase lock loop filter in the detector as a function of lock on. The delay after loss of lock on in revert ing to wide band pilot tone and wideband loop filters is varied as a function of signal strength. The pilot tone may be modulated for tone coded squelch. The modulating source is located in the return end of the phase lock loop filter. A unique filter is provided to insure acquisition of the pilot tone. Automatic gain control of the audio signal is responsive to the tone signal without affecting the com posite audio and tone signal.
