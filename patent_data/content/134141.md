# Pile articles and their production.

## Abstract
An artificial fur like article comprising a cloth like fibrous structure provided with piles having a length of more than 10 mm, each pile being composed of a non attenuated portion whose fineness does not vary substantially along its length, an attenuated portion whose fineness gradually reduces towards the top end, and a fine top end, in which a the non attenuated portion is composed of a core sheath composite fibre having a flatness ratio of 1.5 5 and a fine ness of 8 50 d, and having 1 4 wing shaped projections as viewed in cross section b the top end is formed of the exposed core of the composite fibre and has a substantially uniform fineness of an aver age diameter of 5 25 µm and a length of 0.3 5 mm and c the attenuated portion has a length of 1 15 mm. Said pile article is produced by rotating a cloth like fibrous structure provided with cut piles having a length of more than 10 mm which piles are composed of sheath core composite fi bres, each consisting of a sheath of a fibre forming polyester and a core of a thermoplastic polymer having a decomposition rate in an aqueous solution of NaOH is less than that of the poly ester, and having 1 4 wing shaped projections, a flatness ratio of 1.5 5, an average diameter of the core portion of 5 25 µm and a fineness of 8 50 d fixed to a rotating body contacting the piles with an aqueous solution of an alkali while varying the contacted length by applying a centrifugal force in a direc tion to which the piles are raised, to gradually attenuate the piles toward the top end, and completely decomposing and re moving the sheath polymer at the top end portion.
