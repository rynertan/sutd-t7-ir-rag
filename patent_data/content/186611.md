# COKE FILLED SEPARATOR PLATE FOR ELECTROCHEMICAL CELLS

## Abstract
An electrochemical cell separator plate formed from a mixture of carbonizable resin and coke particles, wherein the plate is molded from the resin and coke particles, carbonized, and graphitized. The particle size distribution of the coke is selected so that expansion occurring during graphitization minimizes the rupture of carbonized bonds within the separator plate. The separator plates have improved prop erties over separator plates formed from graphite particles including increased density, decreased porosity and in creased corrosion resistance. The coke particle plates are more energy efficient to manufacture than graphite particle plates.
