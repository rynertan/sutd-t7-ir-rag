# A DAVIT DEVICE

## Abstract
A davit device for pivoting an accommodation ladder 13 from a stowing position on a ship s deck 16 to a position outside the ship s side by means of a wire 14 , which is connected to the ladder by at least a pulley 19 firmly mount ed above the davit 11 . The object is to provide a davit device which without any external facilities can be automatically brought to pivot past the dead centre at a pivoting of half a revolution, as well as at the lowering and the raising of the ladder. This has been solved by the fact that at the davit 11 there is attached at least one mechanism 15, 37 which is arranged to be switched over at the pivoting of the davit de vice 11, 13 substantially between its end position, so that, when the wire 14 is in its most retracted position and the davit device 11, 13 is in its raised position, the centre of gravity 36 of the davit device has passed the dead centre level, i.e. a vertical line 35 through the pivot axle 12 , in dependent of whether the davit 11 is rotated towards or from stowing position.
