## Description
A PERMANENT MAGNET FIELD TYPE ROTOR STRUCTURE FOR AN ELECTRIC MACHINE BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention The present invention relates to an electric machine, and more particularly to a permanent magnet field type rotor structure for an electric machine. Description of the Prior Art A permanent magnet field type rotor is often used in an electric synchronous motor or the like. The permanent magnet field type rotor has yokes for supporting the magnets and defining pole surfaces. Each yoke is formed of either one piece solid or a stack of blanked sheets. When using yokes consisting of stacked sheets bolted therethrough, these tend to expand radially outward together with the bolts upon rotation of the rotor. This expansion may not be great enough to damage the rotor, but may generate undesirable changes in the magnetic flux distribution. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the invention to provide a permanent magnet field type rotor structure of simple design and superior rigidity. According to the invention, there is provided a permanent magnet field type rotor structure for an electric machine comprising a shaft a pair of axially spaced end plates secured to the shaft a plurality of permanent magnets each extending radially outward from the shaft and extending axially between the end plates a plurality of yokes each arranged between the adjacent magnets and axially extending between the end plates for supporting the magnets, each of the yokes consisting of a plurality of axially stacked sheets and having a hole extending axially therethrough a plurality of rod means each of which extends through the hole of the corre sponding yoke, the opposite ends of said rods being secured to the end plates and means arranged between the end plates for holding together all the rod means to prevent the same from expanding radially outward. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The invention will be more fully understood from the following description of the preferred embodiments of the invention in connection with the attached drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a front view of a permanent magnet field type rotor according to the invention Fig. 2 is a section of the rotor taken along line A A of Fig. 1 and Fig. 3 is a section of the rotor taken along line B B of Fig. 1. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Referring to Figs. 1 to 3, a permanent magnet field type rotor according to the invention comprises permanent magnets 1 and yokes 2. As is best shown in Fig. 2, the magnets 1 and the yokes 2 extend radially outward from a shaft 9 in alternation. The yokes 2, as is well known, support the magnets 1 and define the pole surfaces which project outwardly from the outer surfaces of the magnets 1. Pole shoes 3 extending from either outward edge of the yokes 2 along their entire lengths overlap the outer surfaces of the magnets 1, each of which is rectanglar in cross section. The magnets 1 and yokes 2 come into close contact with each other. The apex of each yoke 2 meets the inside corners of the adjacent magnets 1. As shown in Fig. 1, each of the yokes 2 consists of a plurality of blanked sheets that are stacked axially with respect to the rotor shaft 9. Each of the permanent magnets 1 comprises two magnet elements la and lb separated along a plane generally perpendicular to the shaft axis. Each of the sheet yokes 2 can be separated along the same plane. A non magnetic intermediate plate 4, such as stainless steel plate, is interposed between the separated magnets 1 and yokes 2. The intermediate plate 4 is circular, with a diameter substantially equal to that of the circle defined by the arcs of the segmental yokes. The intermediate plate 4 has a center hole through which the shaft 9 passes. The intermediate plate 4 further has holes at positions corresponding to holes provided in the radially arranged yokes 2 for passing through bolts 7. A pair of axially spaced end plates 5 and 6 are secured to the shaft 9. The assembly comprising the permanent magnets 1, the yokes 2, and the intermediate plate 4 is secured to the end plates 5 and 6 by bolts 7 which extend through the holes in yokes 2, intermediate plate 4, and nuts 8. All the components of the rotor are in this way interconnected to each other to ensure the rigidity of the assembly. The rigid intermediate plate 4 holds the bolts 7 which integrally bind together the sheets making up each of the yokes 2, thereby preventing the expansion of the bolts 7 and the sheet yokes 2 due to centrifugal force uopn rotation of the rotor. The non magnetic intermediate plate 4 does not affect the predetermined magnetic flux distribution. Outward movement of the permanent magnets 1 is prevented by the pole shoes 3 of the yokes 2. The friction between the yokes 2 and the magnets 1 due to their close contact holds the permanent magnets 1 in position. The pole assembly comprising the magnets 1, the yokes 2, and the intermediate plate 4 can be impregnated with an adhesive solution and dried prior to insertion of the assembly over the shaft 9. This also aids the securing of the magnets 1 to the yokes 2. In addition, elastic insertions may be interposed between the shaft 9 and the inner surfaces of magnets 1 to prevent the magnets from moving inwards.
