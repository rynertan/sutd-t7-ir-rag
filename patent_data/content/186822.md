## Description
The invention relates to methods for decomposing undesired organic hydroperoxides in liquid solutions and particularly relates to such decompositions which are catalytically promoted. Organic hydroperoxides are useful materials, particularly as reactants in epoxidations. However, peroxides can also be very troublesome when present as undesirable components by products or leftover reactants in ultimate product streams. For example, in techniques for oxidizing alkanes such as isobutane to give the corresponding alcohol, such as tertiary butyl alcohol for example, tertiary butyl hydroperoxide is also formed as an undesirable by product. If the Similarly, in methods for reacting olefins with organic hydroperoxides, there is usually some unreacted hydroperoxide remaining in the product effluent. Typically in such processes, large amounts of the alcohol corresponding to the hydroperoxide are also produced. If this alcohol is to be used in an application that is sensitive to the presence of even small amounts of residual hydroperoxide, as in the gasoline anti knock, anti icing additive noted above, the hydroperoxide must in some way be removed. One technique for removing small quantities of hydroperoxide involves distilling off the hydroperoxide. This technique can be dangerous if it involves concentrating an unstable hydroperoxide. Molecular sieves are known to be effective in the removal of peroxides from contaminated ethers as revealed in D. R. Burfield, Deperoxidation of Ethers. A Novel Application of Self Indicating Molecular Sieves, If the problem is one of removing hydroperoxide from a solution of its corresponding alcohol, the typical approach is to decompose or convert the hydroperoxide to the alcohol within the solution. One method of conducting this hydroperoxide decomposition is to treat the contaminated solution with high temperature. U. S. Patent 3,474,151 to Grane teaches that hydroperoxides and peroxides contaminating Undesirable hydroperoxides have also been catalytically decomposed. Numerous acidic catalysts or soluble metal catalysts have been employed. Typically the catalysts or reactants employed are acids or ionized metal compounds in solution. The mechanism for acid and ionized metal induced decomposition of hydroperoxides is discussed in Tobolsky, et al., It has also been taught that metals and compounds of metals of Groups IV A, V A or VI A of the Periodic Chart, with the exception of chromium, catalyze the conversion of alkyenyl hydroperoxides to epoxy alcohols as taught in U. S. Patent 3,505,360 to Allison, et al. Further, U. S. Patent 4,059,598 to Coyle demonstrates the decomposition of residual hydroperoxides by contacting the product mixture with a heterogeneous cobalt oxide catalyst which may also contain copper oxide as a promoter. However, as will be shown, cobalt oxide, while it may be heterogeneous, is somewhat soluble in the product mixture. This result is undesirable because it diminishes the amount of available catalyst and because it futher contaminates the product with cobalt. Therefore, an object of the invention is to provide a technique for organic hydroperoxide decomposition that does not involve a catalyst soluble to any measurable extent. The invention concerns a method for the decomposition of an organic hydroperoxide which entails contacting a liquid solution containing an organic hydroperoxide with an insoluble cobalt borate catalyst to give an effluent substantially free of the organic hydroperoxide. It has been surprisingly discovered that cobalt borate is an effective and substantially insoluble catalyst for hydroperoxide decomposition. By substantially insoluble it is meant that after the decomposition reaction there is less than 0.2 ppm cobalt in the solution, 0.2 ppm representing the lowest detectable limit using our atomic adsorption analysis AA . As will be demonstrated, other known catalysts, such as copper oxide promoted cobalt oxide, are soluble to some extent as determined by AA analysis for cobalt. Cobalt borate, of the chemical formula CoB₂O₄, may be used alone or on an inert support. Generally, the support should be inert and neutral. Among the wide variety of suitable inert, non acidic, inorganic supports which may be employed are carbonaceous materials such as charcoal normally insoluble inorganic salts such as barium sulfate non acidic crystalline aluminum silicates of the type known as molecular sieves and other inorganic oxides based on aluminum and or silicon. A new support for cobalt borate has been found in the form of titanium dioxide and one of the preferred embodiments of this invention is cobalt borate on titanium dioxide TiO₂ . As noted, the contaminated liquid solution may be a stream from the production of The cobalt borate catalyst concentration may vary widely from 0.10 to 10.0 wt. based on the solution to be treated. The preferred temperature range for this decomposition treatment is about 50 to 250 C, preferably 80 to 120 C. These temperatures are much lower than those used in thermal decomposition techniques. The decomposition of peroxide compounds according to this invention is generally effected in the liquid phase, by passing the mixture or solution through a suitably contained fixed bed of catalytic material or by contacting the reaction mixture with slurried catalyst. A particularly preferred organic hydroperoxide known to be decomposed by this method is After the hydroperoxide containing mixture has been treated by the method of this invention, the resultant stream, substantially free of hydroperoxides 0.2 wt. or less is separated to recover any remaining components thereof. Often, the hydroperoxide concentration in the effluent after treatment is less than 0.09 wt. . Conventional methods, such as fractional distillation, selective extraction, filtration and the like may be used, depending on the type and amount of mixed components. The following examples will further illustrate the method of this invention, but are not intended to limit the invention in any way. The hydroperoxide containing solutions used throughout are mixtures of TBHP in TBA. It is anticipated that other components may be present without harm to the decomposition results. A 250 ml round bottomed flask equipped with a heating mantle, condenser and magnetic stirrer was charged with 50 ml of a dilute 2.15 wt. solution of In Example 1, a copper oxide promoted cobalt oxide catalyst is used as taught in U. S. Patent 4,059,598. The catalyst was useful for the decomposition of TBHP since only 0.020 remained in the treatment effluent. However, analysis of the filtered reaction mixture showed the presence of 0.24 ppm cobalt and 0.35 ppm copper, indicating that the catalyst was soluble in the reaction mixture. In Example 6, a portion of the cobalt was recovered and used in Example 7. In Example 7, a portion of the catalyst was recovered and used in Example 8. The catalyst was still active after 15 hours. There was no loss of cobalt other than mechanical losses. Cobalt in solution if any was below detectable limits. For Example 10, larger quantities of catalyst and solution were used. Aliquots were withdrawn at time intervals and the weight per cent These examples will illustrate the preparation of the unique cobalt borate on titanium dioxide catalysts. Titanium dioxide pellets 50 ml, 1 8 , Norton were treated with 10 ammonium borate in demineralized water . The pellets were allowed to stand about 15 minutes with occasional stirring. The aqueous solution was decanted and the pellets dried at room temperature for a few minutes. The pellets were then treated with 10 cobalt nitrate in demineralized water . The pellets were again let stand for 15 minutes with occasional stirring. The pellets were dried for 40 hours and a small amount powdered and analyzed for percent cobalt and percent boron by atomic adsorption. The following results were obtained. The procedure was the same as that for Example 19 except that 10 sodium borate was used instead of 10 ammonium borate. The following results were obtained. The procedure was the same as that for Example 20 except that phosphoric acid treated pellets were used. The following results were obtained. The procedure was the same as that for Example 20 except that the pellets were treated only with 10 cobalt nitrate. The following results were obtained. A cobalt borate catalyst from Example 20 which contained 0.677 cobalt and 0.36 boron was charged to a 25 cc stainless steel tubular reactor and TBA pumped through for 1 2 hours at 500 psi. A dilute solution of TBHP 2.0 wt. in TBA was then pumped through the reactor at 30 cc hour. The solution was pumped through the reactor at the desired temperature for several hours and then a 20 25 ml sample was taken for analysis. The results are shown below. Gas chromatography analysis of the reactor effluent from the 140 C run showed 0.43 acetone and 99.14 TBA along with minor amounts of other products. This indicated that most of the TBHP decomposed to TBA. Percent boron was 68 ppm, indicating that only small amounts had leeched. The procedure was the same as that for Example 23 except that different flow rates were used. Many modifications may be made in the method of this invention without departing from the spirit and scope thereof which are defined only in the appended claims. For example, the catalyst proportions and reaction temperature could be modified by one skilled in the art to optimize this decomposition technique.
