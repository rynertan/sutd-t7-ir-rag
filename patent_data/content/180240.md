# Synthesis of neoalkanes.

## Abstract
Neoalkanes of the formula R₁R₂R₃CCH₃ are synthesized by hydrogenation of a neoacid of the formula R₁R₂R₃CCOOH or a neoalcohol of the formula R₁R₂R₃CCH₂OH, wherein R₁, R₂ and R₃ are the same or different alkyl of 1 10 carbon atoms, at a temperature of 250 500 C over a copper oxide zinc oxide catalyst.
