# Three dimensional television system and transmitter suitable therefor.

## Abstract
A three dimensional television system comprising an adapted transmitter 1 , which in further respects does not differ from a colour television system in accordance with the PAL, NTSC or SECAM standard. The three dimensional display in the standard receiver 2 is based on the use of two colours, an observer observing a colour picture display screen 10 through differently coloured glasses 19, 20 . In the transmitter 1 , a first picture pick up device 12 is coupled to an input of a matrix coding circuit 4, 5 via a low pass filter 14 . The filter 14 has a bandwidth which is not more than the bandwidth of the colour difference signal channels in the decoding matrix circuit 7, 8 of the receiver 2 . In order to improve the picture quality a second picture pick up device 13 may instead of directly be coupled to the matrix 4 via a low pass filter 17 having a wider bandwidth to a different input of the matrix coding circuit 4, 5 .
