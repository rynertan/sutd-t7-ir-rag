# Decoder circuit utilising Josephson devices.

## Abstract
In dependence upon address signals A‚ÇÅ, The decoder has three stages, the first stage has two Josephson AND gates, the second stage has four Josephson AND gates, and the third stage has eight Josephson AND gates. Each Josephson AND gate is turned ON for passing current to an output line thereof in dependence upon the logical product of current flowing in the output line of a Josephson AND gate of the preceding stage or, in the case of a Josephson AND gate of the first stage, in dependence upon a decoding start current l
