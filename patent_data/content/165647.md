# PROCESS FOR PREPARATION OF SYNTHETIC CRYSTALLINE ZINC SILICATE MINERAL

## Abstract
A crystalline zinc silicate mineral of the sauconite, hemimorphite or willemite type is prepared by subjecting an acid treated product of a clay mineral and an oxide or hydroxide of zine or a compound capable of forming this oxide or hydroxide under reaction conditions to a hydrother mal treatment. This crystalline zine silicate mineral has a fine and uniform particle size and is excellent in the pigmenting characteristics.
