## Description
ACRYLOYL AND ALKYLACRYLOYL POLYALKOXY CARBAMATES, COMPOSITIONS THEREOF AND THEIR USE IN RADIATION CURABLE COATINGS This application relates to acryloyl polyalkoxy carbamates and alkylacryloyl polyalkoxy carbamates, and compositions containing such carbamates which are suitable for use as radiation curable coatings, particularly those cured by electron beam. The carbamates are low viscosity liquids which also find utility as reactive diluents for polyfunctional acrylate and alkylacrylate resinous materials to give strong and useful coatings. The acryloyl polyalkoxy carbamate and alkylacryloyl polyalkoxy carbamate monomers which comprise an essential ingredient of the compositions of this invention have the formulaEMI1.1 in which R is H or alkyl, preferably H or C1 C4 alkyl, most preferably H or methyl R1 is H, alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl or aralkyl A is alkyl O , in which the alkyl group preferably contains 2 to 4 carbon atoms, and most preferably contains 2 or 3 carbon atoms B is alkyl O , different from A in which the alkyl group preferably contains 2 to 4 carbon atoms, and most preferably contains 2 or 3 carbon atoms m is a number from O to 12 n is a number from O to 12 and m n is 2 or more. Alkyl radicals are preferably Cl C4 alRyl which can contain non interfering substituents. The eferr d cyclon7 yl radicals are cyclcpentyl and particularly cyclohexyl which can be substituted, for example with alkyl groups, particularly C1 C4 alkyl. The aryl radical is preferably phenyl1 which can be substituted with non interfering substituents such as C1 C4 alkyl Cl C4 alkoxy halogen, particularly chloro cyano and nitro. The novel compounds of this invention are prepared by methods which are known in the art. For example, an acrylate or alkylacrylate can be esterified to introduce the A radical resulting in a hydroxy terminated ester which can be in turn chain extended with a 1,2 epoxide, e.g. propylene oxide to introduce one or more B units. This product is hydroxy terminated and can be converted into the claimed carbamate derivative by known reactions, such as by reaction with the appropriate alkyl, aryl or aryl isocyanate, or by reaction with phosgene to form the chloroformate which is then reacted with ammonia or a suitable amine to form the desired product. U.S. Patent 3,674,838 teaches several of the above described reactions to prepare different compounds and teaches still other suitable reaction schemes. Preferably, the compounds of this invention are prepared as mixtures including the carbamate and the chain extended acrylate or methacrylate ester intermediate which has the formulaEMI2.1 Generally, the carbamate comprises 50 to 99 weight percent of the mixture and the above described ester intermediate comprises 1 to 50 weight percent. Preferably, the carbamate constitutes 80 to 99 weight percent and the ester intermediate constitutes 1 to 20 weightDercent of the mixture. Such mixtures result from the preferred reaction scneme wherein an isocyanate is reacted with a stoichiometric excess of the acrylate ester intermediate to ensure complete utilization of isocyanate which is generally a relatively noxious material wnose presence in the product is considered undesirable. The caroamate compunds of this invention and the above described mixtures containing these carpamates are useful in a variety of applications which are in then selves known for other acrylate monomers. Tnese compounds anc mixtures thereof are particularly suwtaz e fcr use alone, or in fixtures wit other monomers as radiation cura le coatings. A number of suitable mixtures are disclosed in the following examples. Curing of tne compositions containing the carbamate compounds disclosed herein can be accomplished with radiation, advantageously with electron beam or ultraviolet radiation. wnen ultraviolet radiation is utilized a photosensitizer in the composition is cesirable. Typical photosensitizers are benzophenone abd benzoin others such as the ethyl or butyl others. In the following examples, all parts are by weight unless otherwise specified. EXAMPLE 1 Into a reaction vessel was charged 3,343.7 parts of 2 hydroxyethyl acrylate HEA , 1.9 parts of triethylamine, 6.9 parts of polymerization inhibitor butylated hydroxytoluene dissolved in toluene, 1.0 part of p benzoquinone, and 2.0 parts of dilaurylthio dipropionate. The reagents were stirred under an atmosphere of 1 3 02 the balance N2 and heated to 700C. Into the flask was added simultaneously from two inlets 3,345.4 parts of propylene oxide PO and 14.3 parts of gaseous BF3. The reaction was comDlete in 4 hrs. t which time 4.3 parts of triethylamine ano 5.2 parts of dibutylin dilaurate were added.Tenperature of the reactants was raiseo to 800 ana 3,112.6 parts of phenyl isocyanate PlC was added ove a 1 nour period. Tne product was stirred at 80 C for 2 hrs more, and cooled. The product contains aoout two moles of propylene oxide per mole of 2 hydroxyethyl acrylate and of phenyl isocyanate and is designated tHEA.2PO.PIC . EXAMPLES 2 4 In the manner described in Example the proportions of 2 hydroxyethyl acrylate HEA , propylene oxide pud and phenyl isocyanate PIC were varied as indicated below to obtain products corresponding to that of Example 1 but containing 1, 1.5 and 5 moles of propylene oxide per mole of 2 hydroxyethyl acrylate and phenyl isocyanate.

An example of a trifunctional acrylate is a reaction product of trimethylolpropane TMP , ethylene oxide EO and acrylic acid AA having the approximate composition TMP EOAA 3, available from Ware Chemical Co. under the name ofChemlink 176. This was blended at various levels with the HEA.XPO.PIC test monomers and NVP. Measurements were made of viscosity of the liquid compositions, tensile properties of cured films produced by electron beam irradiation, and percentage conversion to non volatile Yield by the electron beam polymerization. The values for 5 MR Yields are obtained by coating samples on weighed panels, irradiating the panels witn an electron beam dose of 5 megarads baking separate samples at 1770C 3500F , and under vacuum, and recording the weight after baking as a percentage of the uncured panel.
