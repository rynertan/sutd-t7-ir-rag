# PRODUCTION OF METHYL AND ETHYLAMINES WITH RHODIUM IRON CATALYSTS

## Abstract
A heterogeneous process for selectively producing monoamines in which the nitrogen is bonded only to methyl, ethyl, hydrogen or combinations thereof, characterised in that a mixture of a carbon monoxide, b hydrogen and c ammonia and or nitric oxide is contacted with a het erogeneous solid catalyst comprising rhodium and iron at a temperature of from about 200 to about 450 C a pres sure of from about 15 to about 10,000 psig and a mole ratio of hydrogen to carbon monoxide of from about 20 1 to about 1 20, a nitrogen containing compound selected from the group consisting of ammonia, nitric oxide and mixtures thereof with a heterogeneous solid catalyst comprising rhodim and iron.
