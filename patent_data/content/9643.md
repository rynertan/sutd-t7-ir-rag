The Poly Dichlorophosphazene Polymer Poly dichlorophosphazene polymers which are employed as starting materials in the process of this invention are well known in the art as illcstrated inU.S. Patents 3,370,020 4,005,171 and 4,055,520 and the aforementioned publications of H. R. Allcock, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. These polymers have the general formula NPC12 n . in which n may range from 20 to 50,000 or more. As described in the aforementioned references, the polymers are in general prepared by the thermal polymerization of cyclic oligomers having the formula NPC2 , in which n is an integer of from 3 to 7, with the cyclic trimer and tetramer often comprising up to 90 of the oligomers. The specific conditions of temperature, pressure and time employed in the thermal polymerization of the cyclic oligomers can vary considerably depending on whether or not the polymerization is catalyzed.Thus, temperatures may range from about 1300C to about 300DC, pressures may range from a vacuum of less than about 10 1 Torr to superatmospheric and times may range from 30 minutes to about 48 hours. A preferred process for preparing the poly dichlorophosphazene polymers used in the process of this invention is described in the aforementioned incorporated U.S. Patent 4,005,171. II. The OZ OR m 1 Substituent i.e., The X Substituent As indicated, the OZ OR m 1 substituent is a radical in which Z is B , P , Si , or Ti , in is the valence of Z and R is a branched, straight chain or cyclic alkyl group containing 1 to 12 carbon atoms. As indicated above, radicals represented by the radical include OB OR 2, OP OR 2, OSi OR 3 and OTi OR 3. These radicals may be derived from alkyl borates, alkyiphosphites, tetraalkyl orthosilicates, and tetraalkyl titanates. The alkyl borates which may be employed in forming the copolymers of the invention are the trialkyl borates of the general formla B OR 3 where R may be a branched, straight chain or cyclic alkyl radical and contain from 1 to 12 carbon stoms. The alkyl groups may vary from one site to another in the borate or the alkyl groups may all be identical in the borate. ,Illustrative examples of alkyl borates which may be suitably employed are trimethyl borate, triethyl borate, tripropyl borate and the like, tris 2 ethyl hexyl borate and the like, and tris cyclohexyl borate and the like. Alkylphosphites which may be employed in forming the copolyners of the invention are trialkylphosphites having the general formula P OR where R may be a branched, straight chain or cyclic alkyl radical containing from 1 to 12 carbon atoms. The alkyl radicals may vary from one site to another in the phosphite or may be identical at each site. illustrative examples of alkylphosphites which may be suitably employed are trimethyl phosphite, triethyl phosphite, tripropyl phosphite and the like. Tetraalkyl orthosilicates which may be employed in forming the copolymers of the invention are the tetraalkyl orthosilicates of the general formula Si OR 4 where R may be a branched, straight chain or cyclic alkyl radical with from 1 to 12 carbon atoms. The alkyl radicals may vary from one site to another in the silicate or may be identical at each site. Illustrative examples of the tetraalkyl orthosilicates which may be suitably employed are tetraethyl orthosilicate, tetramethyl orthosilicate, tetrabutyl orthosilicate, tetraoctyl orthosilicate, and the like. A preferred tetraalkyl orthosilicate is tetraethyl orthosilicate. It should be noted here that U.S. Patent 3,702,833 referred to above appears to disclose polyphosphazene terpolymers which contain OSi OR1 2R 1 groups. However, copolymers of this invention which contain OSitOR 3 groups appear to differ in structure from the terpolymers of the patent in that the present copolymers contain the silicate group and other substituent group attached to the same phosphorus atom. Moreover, the patent describes a complicated three step process for forming the terpolymer which involves first hydrolyzing the polydichlorophosphazenes to form a LNPCl2 NP OH2 3n copolymer, then reacting that copolymer with a mixture of sodium alkoxide and then reacting the resultant product with a HOSi OR 3 compound.In contrast, the copolymers of this invention are prepared by a simple process which merely involves reacting the polydichlorophosphazene with a mixture of a Si OR 4 compound and the other substituent forming compound in the presence of a tertiary amine. Tetraalkyl titanates which may be employed in forming the copolymers of the invention are the tetraalkyl titanates of the general formula Ti OR 4 where R may be a branched, straight chain or cyclic alkyl radical with from 1 to 12 carbon atoms. The alkyl radicals may vary from one site to another i the titanate or may be at cach Ill trative examples of the tetraalkyl titanates which may be suitably employed are teaethyl titanate, tetramethyl titanate, tetrabutyl titanate, tetracityl titanate, and the like. A preferred tetraalkyl titanate is tetrabutyl titanate.III. The Alkoxy, Aryloxy, Amino and Mercapto Substituents i.e., The X Substituents As indicated heretofore, the polyphosphazene copolymers of the invention in addition to the OZ OR m 1 substituent group may contain substituted or unsubstituted alkoxy, aryloxy, amino or mercapto groups. The alkoxy groups substituted or unsubstituted may be derived from aliphatic alcohols having from l to 20 carbon atoms such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, n butanol, sec butanol, hexane, dodecanol and the like fluoroalcohols, especially those represented by the formula Z CF2 nCH2OH in which Z is hydrogen or fluorine and n is an integer from 1 to 10 as illustrated by trifluoroethanol, 2,2,3,3,3 pentafluoropropanol, 2,2,3,3,4,4,4 heptafluorobutanol 2,2,3,3 tetrafluoropropanol, 2,2 3,3,4,4,5,5 octafluoropentanol, 2,2,3,3,4,4, 5,5,6,6,7,7 dodecafuoroheptanol and the like. In instances where it is desired to incorporate mixed X substituent groups in the copolymers, mixtures of the foregoing alcohols may be employed. The aryloxy groups substituted or unsubstituted may be derived from aromatic alcohols including among others phenol alkylphenols such as cresols, xylenols, p , o , and m ethyl and propyl phenols and the like halogen substituted phenols such as p , o , and m chloro and bromo phenols and di or tri halogen substituted phenols and the like and alkoxy substituted phenols such as 4 methoxyphenol, 4 n butoxy phenol and the like. Mixtures of the foregoing aromatic alcohols may also be employed. The amino groups may be derived from any of the amino compounds heretofore employed in the polyphosphazene polymer art. Thus, the amino groups may be derived from aliphatic primary and secondary amines such as methylamine, ethylamine, dimethylamine, ethylmethylamine and the like and aromatic amines such as those described in U.S. Patent 4,042,561, incorporated herein by reference, as illustrated by aniline, halogen substituted anilines, alkyl substituted anilines, alkoxy substituted anilines and the like. The mercapto groups may be derived from any of the mercaptan compounds heretofore employed in the polyphosphazene polymer art. Thus, for example, the mercaptan compounds described in U.S. Patent 3,974,242 to Lanier et al, incorporated herein by reference, may be utilized. Representative of suitable mercaptan compounds as described in the aforementioned patent are methyl mercaptan and its hor6logs ethyl, propyl, butyl, aryl and hexyl mercaptans, thiophenol, thionaphthols, benzyl mercaptan, cyclohexyl mercaptan and the like. Preferred substituent groups represented by X are alkoxy, especially fluoroalkoxy, and aryloxy, especially substituted phenols such as halogen substituted phenols. IV. The Tertiary Amine The use of the tertiary amine minimizes undesirable side reactions and at the same time acts as an effective acid scavenger. Tertiary amines which may be employed in preparing the polymers of the invention are those represented by the general structure EMI8.1 wherein R l, R 2, and 3 may each be alkyl containing from 1 to 8 carbon atoms. Thus, for example, the tertiary amine may be a trialkyl amine such as trimethyl amine, triethylamine, tri isopropylamine, tri n propylamine, tri isobutylamine, tri n butylamine, and the like. In addition, tertiary amines such as pyridine,N,N,N ,N tetramethylethylene diamine TMEDA , dipipyridyl ethane, 1,4 diaza bicyclo 2.2.2 octaine DABCO , Nmethyl pyrolle and N methyl morpholine can also be utilized. The preferred tertiary amines for use in preparing the polymers of the invention are triethylamine, N,N,N ,N tetramethylethylene diamine and pyridine. As indicated above, the copolymers of the present invention are prepared by reacting the poly dichlorophosphazene polymer and the substituent mixture of the Z OR m compound and a substituted or unsubstituted aliphatic alcohol, aromatic alcohol, amino compound or mercaptan compound in the presence of a tertiary amine. The specific reaction conditions and proportion of ingredients employed in preparing these copolymers can vary somewhat depending on factors such as the reactivity of the specific substituent mixtures utilized, the particular tertiary amine employed, and the degree of substitution desired in the finished polymer. In general, reaction temperatures may range from about 25 C to about 2000C and times may range from 3 hours up to 7 days lower temperatures necessitating longer reaction times and higher temperatures allowing shorter reaction times. These conditions are, of course, utilized in order to obtain the most complete reaction possible, i.e., in order to insure substantially complete conversion of the chlorine atoms in the polymer to the corresponding esters of the substituent mixture. The above reaction is ordinarily carried out in the presence of a solvent The solvent employed in the reaction should be a solvent for the poly dichlorophosphazene polymer, the substituent mixture and the tertiary amine. Examples of suitable solvents which may be employed include diglyme, triglyme, tetraglyme, toluene, xylene, cyclohexane, chloroform, dioxane, dioxalene, methylene chloride, tetrachloroethane, and tetrahydrofuran. The amount of solvent employed is not critical and any amount sufficient to solubilize the reaction mixture materials can be employed. In addition, the materials in the reaction zone should be reasonably free of water, most preferably containing 0.01 percent by weight of water or less. The avoidance of water in the reaction system is necessary in order to inhibit the reaction of the available chlorine atoms in the chloropolymer therewith. Also the presence of water yields crosslinks with the X substituent groups of the copolymers of this invention at room temperature and therefore, the absence of water is vital until this reaction is desired. Thus, for example, when the X substituent group of the copolymer is derived from an alkyl borate ri.e., B OR 3J, the alkyl groups in the borate linkage in the copolymer will react with water to yield BOH on the copolymer. The BOH site will react with other borate linkages to yield B O B, the crosslink structure.Copolymers containing X substituents derived from alkyl phosphites, tetraalkyl orthosilicates and tetraalkyl titanates react in similar manner with water.Thus, the alkyl groups in the phosphite linkages react with water hydrolyze to yield POH groups which subsequently react with additional POR or POH to give P O P crosslinks the alkyl groups in the silicate linkages react with water to yield SiOH groups which subsequently react with additional SiOR or SiOH to give Si O Si crosslinks and the alkyl groups in the titanate linkages react with water to yield TiOH groups which subsequently react with additional TiOR or TiOH to give Ti o Ti crosslinks. This reaction occurs at room temperature. Its rate is controlled by the amount of X substituent and water present. The resulting crosslinked product is readily realized and due to its highly inorganic character, yields improved flame retardant, heat stability and solvent resistance properties. In general, the amount of the substituent mixture employed in the process should be at least molecularly equivalent to the number of available chlorine atoms in the polymer mixture. However, if desired, an excess of such compounds may be employed in order to insure substantially complete reaction of all the available chlorine atoms. The following examples are submitted for the purpose of further illustrating the nature of the present invention and are not intended as a limitation on the scope thereof. Parts and percentages referred to in the examples are by weight unless otherwise indicated. The following examples i.e., 1 3 illustrate copolymers of the invention in which the X substituent is OB OR 2. rAtIPLE iPreparation ofEMI12.1 tb SEP B Cs17 2 tb SEP b tb SEP N SEP Nt SEP Copolymer tb SEP n tb SEP O CH2CF3 tb To a 10 ounce beverage bottle was charged 13.13 gms. 44 millimoles tris 2 ethyl hexyl borate,B OC8H17 3, 100 cc of dry tetrahydrofuran hereinafterTHF , 12.3 cc 88 millimoles of triethylamine, 3.2 cc 44 millimoles of trifluoroethanol, and 30.3 gms. of a 15.3 poly dichlorophosphazene polymer in THE 4.64 gms., 40.0 millimoles having a degree of polymerization of about 2600.After 20 hrs. in a 1200C rotary bath, the reaction was cooled and the triethylamine salt of 2ethyl.hexyl chloride and triethylamine hydrochlorate settled out of solution and no PCL bonds could be detected by Infrared spectroscopy.

EXA APLE 9 Preparation of NP OH4C6 Cl p OTi OC4H9 3 Copolymer To a 10 ounce beverage bottle was charged 7.53 cc 22 millimoles of tetrabutyl titanate, Ti oC4Hg 4, 100 cc of alcohol free chloroform, 8.49 gms 88 millimoles of p chlorophenol, 12.3 cc 88 millimoles of triethylamine and 42.3 gms. of a 10.93 cyclohexane solution of poly dichlorophosphazene 39.9 millimoles having a degree of polymerization of about 2600. Heating the mixture for 20 hours at 1200C in an oven produced a solution with insoluble amine salts. I.R. showed no P Cl bonds at 600 cm 1 and new bonds at 500 500 cm 1. A film cast from the solution was rubbery in nature and was insoluble in THE after standing for 2 days in air. Elemental analysis of the film showed the following results C H N P Cl Actual 38.55 5.78 5.01 6.37 20.05 Calculated 38.59 5.14 5.86 6.26 19.93 Based on a composition consisting of 29.8 percent triethylemine, 3.8 percent chloropolymer, 42.1 percent p chlorophenol derivative and 10.7 percent titanate derivative.
