## Description
The present invention relates to optically coupled chemical sensing devices and to processes for detecting the presence of chemical compounds which liberate hydrogen when in contact with palladium or other metals. Electroluminescence occurs in semiconductor materials which are capable of emitting visible or near visible radiation when an electrical current passes through the semiconductor. Photoluminescence can also occur in these materials. If external light is used to excite the semiconductor, a characteristic wavelength of light is emitted. These characteristic wavelengths vary amongst different photoluminescent semiconductors and can be varied in a single semiconductor by doping the material. The dopant will ordinarily cause a shift in the wavelength of radiation emitted by the material. Amongst the various studies on the luminescence of photo stimulated or electroluminescent materials is Luminescent Photoelectrochemical Cells , Streckert, H. H., Tong, J. and Ellis, A. B., J. Am. Chem. Soc., Vol. 104, No. 2, 1982, pp. 581 588. It is noted therein that the intensity of light emitted by electroluminescence and photoluminescence varies directly with the applied voltage. The efficiency of charge transfer and good electrical contact at the surface is also noted as important in the efficiency of the process. EP A 0 121 408 discloses semiconductor electrodes having multicolor luminescence. These semiconductors comprise solid state solutions of three elements which vary in a vertically anisotropic manner. The preferred solid state solutions are of cadmium, sulfur and selenium. U.S. Patent 4,211,586 discloses a method of forming a multicolor light emitting array of diodes. The diodes are formed by differentially etching a graded n type semiconductor and diffusing a p type dopant into the surface of the n type semiconductor to form a p n junction diode.

A study of Pd s MIS Schottky barrier diode hydrogen detector and BE A 854 713 disclose hydrogen detectors that detect the presence of hydrogen using a Schottky diode where the height of the Schott barrier varies when hydrogen is adsorbed into the metal layer. It has been found in the practice of the present invention that palladium or other metal coated photoluminescent semiconductors exhibit an optical response to certain compounds during photostimulation. Compounds which dissociate on contact with palladium or other metals to provide atomic or molecular hydrogen sufficiently perturb the photoluminescent intensity or spectral distribution of Pd or other metal containing Schottky diodes so that mechanical or visual detection of that perturbation can be made. Photoluminescent Schottky diodes with barriers resulting from transparent or translucent palladium and other metal coatings with n type or p type semiconductors exhibit alterations in their photoluminescent properties when exposed to certain compounds. It is believed that compounds which liberate or form atomic or molecular hydrogen on contact with palladium or other metals such as platinum, rhodium, etc. affect the metal work function in the diode. This effect can be sensitive to parts per million of such compounds in the environment. Schottky barriers are formed by a metal to semiconductor interface which exhibits a non linear impedence. The Schottky barrier arises because of the contact potential difference in work functions between the metal and the semiconductor. The diffusional potential or bandbending V Photoluminescent semiconductors are well known in the art. They are generally solid state solutions of at least two or three elements which, when stimulated by actinic radiation, emit radiation. Both the actinic and emitted radiation are generally visible or near visible radiation 300 900nm . When a coating over the radiation emitting surface of the semiconductor is a metal such as palladium which when penetrated by hydrogen alters the height of the Schottky barrier, the luminescence of the semiconductor has been found to be altered by the presence of atomic or molecular hydrogen on the radiation emitting surface. Since compounds such as ammonia and hydrazine generate hydrogen when in contact with palladium, variations in photoluminescence are an indication of the presence of such compounds. Particularly useful n type semiconductors which can be used to form the detectors according to the present invention are CdS, CdSe, and CdS A functional apparatus for actually using this phenomenon for detecting the presence of compounds that release hydrogen in contact with palladium would have at least the following 3 components the metal coated semiconductor, a source of actinic radiation directed at the radiation emitting surface of the diode formed by the coating on the semiconductor, and an optical detector. The diode has already been described. The actinic radiation source may be merely an opening exposing the diode to available light room light, sunlight, etc. or may be any internal source of radiation such as a light bulb, light emitting diode, or laser. The radiometer may be selected from amongst the many commercially available radiometers, its selection being primarily dependent upon the ultimate sensitivity desired in the final article. Fiber optics may be used to carry actinic radiation to the diode or to carry emitted radiation away from the diode. The distribution of hydrogen on the radiation emitting surface of the semiconductor is in a state of equilibrium. The equilibrium is generally reached in a matter of seconds. Between uses, storage in an environment free of hydrogen releasing compounds or in normal room conditions, will be sufficient to clean the semiconductor surface. It is generally best to equilibrate the detector in an environment which is similar to that in which a change in the concentration of hydrogen releasing gas might be expected. The latter will enable the detection of a change in the concentration of hydrogen releasing compounds in the environment while the former would register residuals of such compounds also. The metal layer in the photoconductor should be between 10 and 750 Angstroms, preferably between 20 and 500 Angstroms, more preferably between 30 and 400 Angstroms. Samples of n type, single crystal, CdS and CdSe Deposition used Pd foil 50x50x0.1 mm 99.997 metallic purity and a commercial sputtering apparatus. Sputtering was conducted at 2x10 ⁴ torr Ar pressure and 60 µA beam current for approximately 45 seconds a parallel deposition onto Pt foil was used in conjunction with electrochemical stripping 0.75 V vs. standard calomel electrode in 1M HCl aqueous electrolyte , estimating the Pd layer thickness as about 100A . Photoluminescent spectra were recorded using 457.9 and 488.0 nm excitation from an argon ion laser. An Aminco Bowman spectrometer equipped with a Hamamatsu R446S PMT was used to measure variations in emission. The sample was enclosed in a cell which permitted dry N₂, a 3 1 N₂ H₂ mixture, or air to bathe the sample flow rates of approximately 0.5 liters min were employed. The photoluminescent spectrum from the Pd CdS sample in air, illuminated through the metal with 457.9 nm ultraband gap E These spectral changes are consistent with a reduction in Schottky barrier height resulting from the dissolution of H₂ in Pd. Qualitatively, the photoluminescent intensity is expected to rise because the smaller electric field in the semiconductor allows a larger fraction of e h pairs to radiatively recombine. By regarding the region supporting the electric field as being completely nonemissive, i.e., a dead layer, a quantitative expression for relative PL intensity can be obtained, eq. 1 In this expression, H₂ and The photoluminescent enhancements seen for the two excitation wavelengths employed give a consistent value for ΔD of 500 600A . This contraction of the electric field upon exposure to H₂ can be related to a reduction in Schottky barrier height if the initial height is known. Literature estimates for the Pd CdS barrier height in air range from 0.5 0.8 eV. The resultant i V curves yield an estimated height of 0.6 eV. The depletion width W is related to barrier height qV by eq. 2 , where ε charge, and and N Another illustration of these effects is provided by a Schottky diode formed from a graded CdS Exposure of a Pd CdS In summary, bulk PL from Pd CdS and Pd CdS
