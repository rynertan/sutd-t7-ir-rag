# Method of producing high speed, tool and die steel articles.

## Abstract
A method of producing high speed, tool and die steel articles from prealloyed powders. The method comprises placing particles of a prealloyed steel composition from which the article is to be made in a deformable container, heating the container and particles and then passing the heated container through a forging box having a plurality of hammers evenly spaced around the container and adapted to extend and retract radially to impart a radial forging action to the container. The forging action is of a magnitude and duration to compact the particles to an essentially fully dense article. Preferably, there are four hammers arranged in two pairs with the hammers of each pair being opposed and adapted to extend and retract in unison.
