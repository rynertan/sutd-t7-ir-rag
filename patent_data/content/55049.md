# Discharge lamp arc tubes.

## Abstract
An arc discharge lamp is provided using sealing composi tions comprising mainly Al₂O₃ SiO₂ MgO selected from com positions lying within the area ABCDEFGH on the undernoted ternary phase diagram and methods of using these are de scribed. Preferred compositions include between 15 to 28 by weight of MgO and 13 to 21 by weight of Al₂O₃ since these have lower melting points than others in the group. The sealing compositions are used to seal end closure members of alumi na or cermet to ceramic arc tubes for use in discharge lamps. The compositions are selected to have linear expansion co ef ficients compatible with the materials of the end closures and arc tubes. The methods described give sealing times of be tween 3 and 4 minutes.
