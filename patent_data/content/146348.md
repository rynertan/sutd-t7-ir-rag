## Description
The present invention relates to substituted naphthalenes, indoles, benzofurans and benzothiophenes many of which are novel which are useful as inhibitors of the synthesis of leukotrienes and as inhibitors of the action of lipoxygenase in mammalian metabolism. The leukotrienes are a class of unsaturated fatty acid compounds which are derived from arachidonic acid by the action of lipoxygenase. Some are potent constrictors of human bronchi, mediating the action of slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis SRS A see Dahlen, Nature Leukotrienes may act as agonists in immediate hypersensitivity and other pathological conditions. Leukotriene C₄ LTC₄ and leukotriene D₄ LTD₄ , especially, are potent mucous secretagogues. Shelhamer In mammalian metabolism, arachidonic acid is transformed to 12 L hydroperoxy 5,8,10,14 eicosatetraenoic acid by the action of 12 lipoxygenase. Similarly, 5 lipoxygenase transforms arachidonic acid into 5 S hydroperoxy 6,8,11,14 eicosatetraenoic acid. Thus, an agent which inhibits the action of lipoxygenase may be useful in treating or preventing untoward conditions associated with lipoxygenase products. A number of substituted 1 hydroxy 4 methoxy naphthalenes see formula I R₃ H are known. Thus, K.H.

In formula Ia, the AA substituent is an amino acid derivative which may be in the D and or L configuration, the prefixes D and L are a means of indicating the The compounds of the present invention will be named herein using the Chemical Abstracts numbering system see Naming and Indexing of Chemical Substances for Chemical Abstracts during the Ninth Collective Period 1972 1976 , a reprint of section IV from the Volume 76 Index Guide. When D is CH CH , the compounds are named as naphthalenes. When D is N CH₃ , the compounds are named as N methyl indoles, and when D is O and S , the compounds are named as benzofurans and benzothiophenes, respectively. As noted, compounds of this invention are useful to inhibit the formation of slow reacting substance anaphylaxis SRS A and thus its smooth muscle contracting and secretory effects. To demonstrate the SRS A inhibitory activity of the compounds of this invention, compounds of this invention were evaluated in a standard laboratory test. This test is conducted in rat mononuclear cells incubated in the presence of cysteine and challenged with a calcium ionophore which induces SRS A formation . Among the non amino compounds of this invention, in this test system, 1 acetoxy 2 n butyl 4 methoxynaphthalene Example 3 and 1 acetoxy 2,3 diethyl 4 methoxynaphthalene Example 4 are preferred. At a concentration of 10 micrograms ml, these compounds inhibited the synthesis of SRS A 100 and 95 , respectively. Certain of the amino acyl compounds of this invention formula Ia were evaluated in a standard laboratory test to measure the inhibition of leukotriene synthesis. Four of the amino type compounds of this invention were preferred in this test. Specifically, in this test system, L Valine, 2,3 diethyl 4 methoxynaphth 1 yl ester, hydrochloride L Valine, 2 n butyl 4 methoxynaphth 1 yl ester L Valine, 2 n butyl 4 methoxynaphth 1 yl ester, hydrochloride and L Alanine, 2 n butyl 4 methoxynaphth 1 yl ester were preferred. At a concentration of 1 microgram ml, these compounds inhibited the synthesis of leukotriene 100 , 97 , 93 , and 98 , respectively. At a concentration of 10 micrograms ml, these compounds completely inhibited the synthesis of leukotriene. The amino acyl compounds of this invention are also preferred for drug formulation because they are more easily crystallizable particularly, the salts and are more water soluble. On the basis of biological activity and ease of formulation, L Valine, 2,3 diethyl 4 methoxynaphth 1 yl ester, hydrochloride is the most preferred. The compounds of the present invention were also tested for lipoxygenase inhibition. Arachidonic acid is added to washed human platelets and the oxygen uptake is measured using oxygraph cells. A decrease of oxygen uptake versus the control cell indicates inhibition of lipoxygenase. For a full description of the procedure see, Wallach, et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 231 445 1976 . Using this system, 1 acetoxy 2 n butyl 4 methoxynaphthalene Example 3 and 1 acetoxy 2,3 diethyl 4 methoxynaphthalene Example 4 are preferred, both compounds completely inhibiting 5 HETE production at 10 µM. The former compound exhibits an IC₅₀ of approximately 10 ⁷M. Thus, some of the novel compounds of this invention have been shown to be active as inhibitors of the production of leukotrienes and some of the compounds of this invention have been shown to be active as inhibitors of the lipoxygenase enzyme system. Some of these compounds are effective in both systems. All of the compounds of this invention are active as inhibitors of at least one of these two systems. Accordingly, these novel compounds are useful for administration to mammals, including humans, whenever it is desirable medically to inhibit either of these systems. Inhibitors of either system are useful in the treatment of asthma. Thus, all of the compounds of this invention are useful in the treatment of asthma. For example, these compounds are useful as broncho dilators or as inhibitors of mediators such as SRS A which are released from cells activated by an antigen antibody complex. Thus, these compounds control spasm and facilitate breathing in conditions such as bronchial asthma, bronchitis, bronchiectasis, pneumonia and emphysema. For these purposes, these compounds are administered in a variety of dosage forms, e.g., orally in the form of tablets, capsules, or liquids rectally in the form of suppositories parenterally, subcutaneously, or intramuscularly, with intravenous administration being preferred in emergency situations, by inhalation in the form of aerosols or solutions for nebulizers or by insufflation in the form of powder. Doses in the range of about 0.01 to 50 mg per kg of body weight are used 1 to 4 times a day, the exact dose depending on the age, weight, and condition of the patient and on the frequency and route of administration. For the above use these compounds can be combined advantageously with other anti asthmatic agents, such as sympathomimetics isoproterenol, phenylephrine, ephedrine, etc. xanthine derivatives theophylline and aminophylline and corticosteroids ACTH and prednisolone . As noted above, the compounds of this invention are particularly useful in treating asthma, but any allergy wherein slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis SRSA is thought to be involved as a pharmacological mediator of anaphylaxis can be treated. For example, the compounds can be used for treatment of such conditions as allergic rhinitis, food allergy and urticaria as well as asthma. The compounds of this invention are effectively administered to human asthma patients by any covenient route such as oral inhalation, aerosol inhalation, parenterally, orally, intravenously, interperitoneally , transdermally, topically and the like. The amino acyl compounds of this invention are preferred for intravenous infusions and the like. Particularly preferred in this regard is L Valine, 2 n butyl 4 methoxy 1 naphthalenyl ester, monohydrochloride. The non acyl amino compounds of this invention are preferred for topical administration. For administration by the oral inhalation route with conventional nebulizers or by oxygen aerosolization it is convenient to provide the instant active ingredient in dilute solution, preferably at concentrations of about 1 part of medicament to form about 100 to 200 parts by weight of total solution. Entirely conventional additives may be employed to stabilize these solutions or to provide isotonic media, for example, sodium chloride, sodium citrate, citric acid, sodium bissulfite, and the like can be employed. For administration as a self propelled dosage unit for administering the active ingredient in aerosol form suitable for inhalation therapy the composition can comprise the active ingredient suspended in an inert propellant such as a mixture of dichlorodifluoromethane and dichlorotetrafluoroethane together with a co solvent, such as ethanol, flavoring materials and stabilizers. Instead of a co solvent there can also be used a dispensing agent such as oleyl alcohol. Suitable means to employ the aerosol inhalation therapy technique are described fully in U.S. Pat. No. 2,868,691 for example. The lipoxygenase inhibitor compounds of this invention are useful whenever it is desired to inhibit platelet aggregation, reduce the adhesive character of platelets, and remove or prevent the formation of thrombi in mammals, including man, rabbits, dogs, and rats. For example, these compounds are useful in the prevention of myocardial infarcts, to prevent post operative thrombosis, to promote patency of vascular grafts following surgery, and to treat conditions such as atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, blood clotting defects due to lipemia, and other clinical conditions. For these purposes, these compounds are administered systemically, e.g., intravenously, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, and in the form of sterile implants for prolonged action. For rapid response, especially in emergency situations, the intravenous route of administration is preferred. Doses in the range about 0.005 to about 20 mg per kg of body weight per day are used, the exact dose depending on the age, weight, and condition of the patient or animal, and on the frequency and route of administration. These lipoxygenase inhibitor compounds are further useful as additives to blood, blood products, blood substitutes, or other fluids which are used in artificial extracorporeal circulation or perfusion of isolated body portions, e.g., limbs and organs, whether attached to the original body, detached and being preserved or prepared for transplant, or attached to a new body. During these circulations and perfusions, aggregated platelets tend to block the blood vessels and portions of the circulation apparatus. This blocking is avoided by the presence of these compounds. For this purpose, the compound is added gradually or in single or multiple portions to the circulating blood, to the blood of the donor animal, to the perfused body portion, attached or detached, to the recipient, or to two or all of these at a total steady state dose of about 0.001 to 10 mg per liter of circulating fluid. It is especially useful to use these compounds in laboratory animals, e.g., cats, dogs, rabbits, monkeys, and rats, for these purposes in order to develop new methods and techniques for organ and limb transplants. Hammerström, et al. Science 197 994 996 1977 notes the role of 12 lipoxygenase in psoriasis. Doig, et al., Prostaglandins 20 1007 1019 1980 and Lin, et al., J. Clin. Invest. 70 1058 1982 disclose that 5 lipoxygenase inhibitors block platlet thrombus formation. Dawson, et al., in SRS A and Leukotrienes, 219 226 Wiley and Sons 1981 note that 5 lipoxygenase inhibitors block neutrophil recruitment during inflammatory diseases such as arthritis. In addition, 5 lipoxygenase inhibitors prevent the production of slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis SRS A , now known to be a mixture of leukotrienes. Leukotrienes are synthesized using 5 lipoxygenase. SRS A mediates the symptoms and pathophysiology of asthma. See Murphy, et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA, 4275 4279 1979 . Thus, the 5 lipoxygenase inhibitors disclosed herein are useful in the treatment of asthma. 5 Lipoxygenase products have been implicated in essential hypertension Chand, et al., Microcirculation 1 111 123 1981 , and gout Rae, et al., Lancet 1122 1124 Nov. 20, 1982 , indicating that the 5 lipoxygenase inhibitors disclosed herein are useful in treating these conditions as well. Further, neutrophil depletion, such as that induced by 5 lipoxygenase inhibitors, has been shown to cause a significant decrease in infarct size following circumflex artery occlusion. See Romson, et al., Circulation 66 85 1982 . Thus, the 5 lipoxygenase inhibitors herein may be useful in the protection of the myocardium following infarct. The lipoxygenase inhibitors of the present invention are also useful for the prevention or treatment of deep vein thrombosis DVT . This method comprises the administration of a compound of the Formula I to a mammal susceptible to DVT. By deep vein thrombosis DVT is meant the thrombosis clot formation of the lower limb deep veins deeply situated veins . Such thrombosis is frequently a result of major surgery, massive trauma, myocardial infarction, neoplasia, and pregnancy. The term deep vein thrombosis or DVT is meant to encompass the thrombosis resulting from these or any other causes. By prevention in this context is meant the total or partial avoidance of clot formation in the deep veins of a mammal. The present invention includes the treatment of each of various mammalian species, including humans. With respect to non humans, the present invention is particularly and especially concerned with treating domesticated animals such as cattle, dogs, cats and swine. Nevertheless, compounds of the the invention are most preferably used in the treatment of humans. Any convenient route of administration may be employed, such as parenteral e.g. intravenous, intraperitoneal or intramuscular administration, but oral administration is the preferred route for use in humans. The dosage regimen for the lipoxygenase inhibitor compounds used to treat deep vein thrombosis will depend on a variety of factors, including the type, age, weight, sex and medical condition of the mammal, and most importantly on the risks and probable consequences of deep vein thrombosis. A physician or veterinarian can determine these factors and prescribe an effective amount of the lipoxygenase inhibitor. When 1 acetoxy 2 butyl 4 methoxynaphthalene or 1 acetoxy 2,3 diethyl 4 methoxynaphthalene is used, the dosage may be 0.01 to 1 mg kg min by intravenous infusion, or 0.01 to 50 mg kg day by oral administration. Equivalent dosages for other routes of administration may be used. When other lipoxygenase inhibitors are employed, equipotent doses are administered based on the compound s comparative potency as demonstrated in the standard laboratory test set forth as Example 20 below. The most preferred used of these compounds is as SRS A inhibitors, e.g. in the treatment of asthma. Compounds of formula I in which R₃ is H or CH₃CO are prepared by the first reaction shown in Chart A. A carbene complex of formula A 1 is reacted with an alkyne of formula A 2 preferably 1.5 equivalents . If R₃ is CH₃CO, the reaction may be carried out in the presence of acetic acid or acetic anhydride and, preferably, triethylamine . The reaction is conducted with mild heating preferably in a bath at 60 to 65 C to yield the formula A 3 product. The reaction is preferably under in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran THF in an inert atmosphere e.g. argon . Chromium complexes of formula A 1 are well known and readily available, or may be prepared by known means. Pentacarbonyl aryl methoxy carbene chromiums wherein the aryl moiety is phenyl, 2 N methylpyrrolyl , 2 furyl or 2 thienyl are described by Fisher, J. Organometal. Chem.

Physical characteristics are as follows In accordance with the procedure of Example 13, Part B, the free amine is converted to the hydrochloric acid salt, and recrystallized from absolute ethanol and ether in n hexane. Physical characteristics are as follows Nine adult domestic short hair cats weighing 4.5 5 kg were anesthetized with sodium pentabarbital 25 30 mg kg i.v. . The neck area was prepared for a sterile cut down procedure and the jugular veins were exposed. After exposure of the veins each animal was injected with epsilon amino caproic acid eaca to inhibit plasminogen activation 2.5 grams i.v. in Tyrode s solution . This was done to reduce the normally highly active feline fibrinolytic mechanism and, thus reduce lysis of fibrin thrombi which might form in the vessel. Six of the cats were also treated with 2,3 diethyl 4 methoxy 1 naphthalenol, acetate. Three of the cats were given 1 mg kg i.v. and 3 of the cats were treated with 5 mg kg i.v. prior to venous occlusion. The jugular veins were carefully dissected free of surrounding connective tissue and the vein was ligated at the thoracic inlet with 3 0 dexon. The skin incision was closed and the animals were maintained in surgical anesthesia for 2 hours. At the end of the 2 hour waiting period, the jugular veins were exposed again. A 25 gauge butterfly needle was positioned into the lumen and blood was flushed out of the vein with heparinized Tyrode s solution 1U heparin ml . The veins were tied off and removed under physiologic pressure. The vessels were immediately immersed in a 2.5 glutaraldehyde solution prepared in Tyrode s solution for fixation. The veins were fixed overnight at 5 degrees centigrade, postfixed in 1 osmium tetroxide overnight, dehydrated in ethanol and substituted by amyl acetate. All veins were critical point dried from carbon dioxide using a Denton DCP 1 critical point drying apparatus. The veins were mounted on stubas, gold coated on a Denton DV 502 modified vacuum evaporator and examined on a Cambridge Stereoscan 150 scanning electron microscope. Two hours of jugular vein stasis following the trauma of dissection caused massive white cell adhesion to and migration under the venous endothelium of non treated cats and produced sloughing of the endothelium and exposure of the basement membrane. This damage was sufficient to initiate thrombosis. Many of the exposed areas of basement membrane had adherent platelets. The platelets were adherent as monolayers or as aggregates. In some areas fibrin was found deposited on the endothelium or exposed basement membrane. Leukocytes were occasionally associated with the fibrin. 2,3 Diethyl 4 methoxy 1 naphthylenol, acetate had a dose dependent effect on the vascular changes described above. The 1 mg kg dose did not reduce leukocyte adhesion or migration. Most of the surface of all the veins examined in this group had multiple aggregates of leukocytes visible under the intact endothelium. Although leukocyte migration was not inhibited, leukocyte release of hydrolytic enzymes and production of superoxide s was apparently inhibited. Few areas with detached endothelial cells or exposed basement membrane were found in this group. The 5 mg kg dose had an even greater inhibitory effect on leukocyte mediated damage. In this group only patchy areas of adherent leukocytes were observed. In most of these areas leukocytes were also found under the endothelium. It was only in these areas, however, that endothelial cell loss and platelet deposition were observed. The numbers of adhering and migrating leukocytes found in this group appeared to be less than in either the control or 1 mg kg treated group. With the exception of one vein, approximately half or more of the vascular surface had an intract endothelial cell cover with few adherent leukocytes. Only occasional small areas of fibrin deposition were found in this group.
