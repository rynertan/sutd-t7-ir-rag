# Method and apparatus for skiving and hemming.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus are disclosed for skiving and hemming one or more edges of a paperboard web or blank to improve the sealing qualities of a container made from the paperboard. The paperboard is skived twice generally paral lel to its edge, once to define an oblique surface and once to make a flat skived surface. The latter is folded over the former and heat sealed to a heat sealable material adjacent the skived region, defining a wedge shaped edge portion. The folded over part is preferably ironed to produce a substantially flat sheet, and the wedge shaped edge is preferably reshaped at some point in the process to make the entire folded over surface substantially flush with the unskived surface to which it is sealed. The flat skived surface is preferably made by a milling procedure in which the milling teeth strike the material while moving in a direction opposite to that of the motion of the material.
