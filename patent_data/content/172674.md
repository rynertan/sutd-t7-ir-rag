# Scroll type fluid compressor.

## Abstract
A scroll type fluid compressor includes a housing, 10 a pair of scroll elements 13,14 each comprising an end plate 131,141 and a spiral wall 132,142 projecting from one surface of the respective end plate. The walls are interfitted to make a plurality of line contacts and each formed with a groove 134,144 on the end surface of each wall which receives a seal element 22 . Each groove 134,144 is formed with its centre line radially inward of the centre line of its respective spiral wall. This construction prevents the side walls of the groove from prematurely deteriorating and causing attendant destruction of the scroll elements.
