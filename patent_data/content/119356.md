# Apparatus for measuring parameters of optical fibres.

## Abstract
Apparatus for measuring the spot size of light emerging from an optical fibre comprises a rotating radial grating which is moved relative to a monochromatic beam of light, passing through the fibre, to vary the spatial frequency of the light entering a photodetector situated at the output end of the optical fibre, thereby obtaining a variation in the modulation amplitude of the light received by the detector allowing measurement of the spot size to be obtained.
