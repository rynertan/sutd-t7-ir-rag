For affixing auxiliary articles such as sealed straws, spoons etc. to commodities such as food or beverage containers, devices for applying adhesive and or for pressing the articles to the side face of the commodities are located at the side of a conveyor on which the articles are moved in an upstanding position past said devices. Each device D.E. is mounted on a support 13, 14 having means 13a, 13b for tilting the device about an axis substantially at right angles to the side face of the commodities A and passing substantially through the center point thereof. This enables the articles and the adhesive application points to be aligned with any of the diagonal lines L7, L2 of the side face of the container.
