# Transmission apparatus.

## Abstract
A transmission apparatus having an annular casing formed integrally, in its inner face, with a plurality of wave shaped inner teeth, a plurality of drive roll elements rolling along the toothed inner face of the annular casing, a carrier for swingably supporting the drive roll elements by means of associated connecting element, and a wave generator for cyclically urging the drive roll elements to radialy displace while rolling along the toothed inner face, thereby urging the carrier element to exert thereon a drive force.
