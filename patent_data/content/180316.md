# Apparatus for use in spacing letters.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus are described for producing optically satisfactorily laterally spaced letters which have been sequentialiy transferred from a dry transfer sheet. The sheet 28 is held in a holder 20 which incorporates a short free motion linkage enabling the sheet so held to be moved horizontally over a short distance, the short distance being accurately repeated each time such movement is effected. By butting the letter next to be transferred to the letter just transferred and then moving the fixed distance away, visually pleasing letter spacing may be simply achieved without the use of extra transferable markings which need to be transferred to the working surface and subsequently removed, and without the need for excessively complex apparatus or for drawing alignment or spacing lnes on the receptor.
