# LIME SOAP DISPERSING COMPOSITIONS AND THEIR USE

## Abstract
Compositions and method of using such compositions in washing applications which comprise at least one water soluble organic surfactant selected from anionic and nonionic surfactants and a lime soap dispersant having molecular weight of 2,000 to 200,000 that is a homopolymer of a polyalkylene glycol monoacrylate, a copolymer of an acrylamido alkane sulfonic acid and a polyalkylene glycol monoacrylate, or a water soluble salt thereof, the copolymer being composed of 5 to 80 by weight of polymerized units derived from the sulfonic acid and relative amount of the surfactant to the copolymer is in the range of 125 1 to 1 10.
