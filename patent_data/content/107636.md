## Description
MULTICOMPONENT MEMBRANE FOR GAS SEPARATION AND GAS SEPARATION PROCESS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention This invention relates to multicomponent membranes for. gas separations.Prior Art U.S. Patent 4,230,463 discloses a hollow fiber membrane which is coated with polyCsiloxane for use in separating gases such as hydrogen from other gases. One of the problems which we have found to exist with a multi component membrane of this type is that the effectiveness of the coating is destroyed or substantially reduced if the gas being treated contains certain contaminants. Examples of contaminants which are detrimental to a multicomponent gas separation membrane of this type are aliphatic hydrocarbons such as hexane aromatics such as benzene and toluene methanol ammonia and hydrogen sulfide. Very small percentages of these contaminants in the feed gas stream are sufficient to have i seriously damaging effect on F membrane of this type. Upon exposure to the contaminant the permeability of the coated membrane for a given gas will change signi fi cantly, thereby changing the separation factor and reducing the effectiveness of the fiber. Continued exposure of the membrane to the contaminant results in such a significant change in the separation factor that the membrane becomes ineffective for separating one gas from a mixture. Most of the contaminants found in various feed gas streams can be removed prior to contact of the gas stream with the membrane, in order to avoid damage to the membrane. Unfortunately, this adds at least one more step to the process, thereby increasing the cost and complexity of the gas treatment process. U.S. Patent 4,230,463 also discloses that the dimethylsiloxane coating utilized in the disclosed coated fiber membrane may be cross linked by using a crosslinking agent such as alpha methyl styrene. No indication is given as to the desirability of using such a crosslinked coating and it does not have the advantages of the cross linked coating of this invention, as pointed out below. U.S. Patent 3,035,016 discloses a caulking compound made by reacting acyloxy silanes with hydroxylated siloxanes. It is said that these compositions give a surface cure within 30 minutes but remain soft for years and adhere to glass, porcelain and other materials U.S. Patent 3,133,891 discloses the reacting of a diorganopolysiloxane and an organotriacyloxysi lane to form self vulcanizing compositions which may be used for caulking, coating glass, etc. U.S. Patent 3,127,363 discloses a process for making a vulcanized silicone elastomer by reacting a pre condensed difunctional silicone with a cross linking agent having reactive groups such as hydroxyl, alkoxy, aryloxy or amino groups. These elastomers are said to be useful as moulding compositions, as a material for filling teeth, as sealing and coating compositions and in the manufacture of laminates. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The membrane of the invention is a multicomponent membrane for gas separation wherein an anisotropic polymeric substrate membrane is coated with the condensation product of silanol terminated poly dimethylsiloxane and a cross linking compound having the fomula R M Si OR2 3 where R1 is CH3, SH, Cl, CF3, NCOEMI3.1 or N CHzCH2OH 2, M is CH2 , CH2CH2 or CH2CH2CH2 , and R2 is CH3, CH2 CH3, orEMI3.2 The process of the invention is one of separating gases from a mixture thereof by selective permeation through a multicomponent membrane of the invention. DEAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The multicomponent membrane of this invention is useful in separating one gas from a mixture of gases. For example, the membrane is useful in separating oxygen from nitrogen and hydrogen from at least one of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, oxygen, argon, n rous oxide and C1 C5 hydrocarbons, especially methane, ethane and ethylene. Various mixtures of these and other gases are frequently found in various commercial processes. The separation of one gas from a mixture is effected by virtue of the fact that the membrane is more permeable to that one gas than other gases of the mixture.In carrying out the separation operation, the mixture of gases is brought into contact with one side of the membrane, at a suitable pressure differential across the membrane, and the more permeable, or faster , gas permeates the membrane and is recovered from the other side thereof.When the membrane is in the form of a hollow fiber, one side is the outer surface of the fiber and the other side is the internal or bore surface of the fiber. For a given cross sectional area of a given membrane, the rate of recovery of the faster gas and the purity of the recovered gas is determined by the pressure differential maintained across the membrane and the ratio of the permeability of the faster gas with respect to the other gases of the mixture. The higher the permeability of the faster gas, with respect to the other gases of the mixture, the more effective will be the separation operation. It is unfortunate that certain multicomponent membranes can lose substantially all of their ability to separate one gas from a mixture if the gas mixture contains certain contaminants. For example, the effectiveness of the polysulfone membrane disclosed in U.S.Patent 4,230,463 is substantially reduced if the gas stream contains even very small amounts of contaminants such as C3 C8 hydrocarbons aromatics such as benzene or toluene methanol ammonia hydrogen sulfide etc. In the past, problems caused by these contaminants have been avoided by removal of the contaminant prior to bringing the gas mixture into contact with the membrane.This has added an additional step to the process, with attendant increases in costs and complexity. Also, if the contaminant removal step fails for some reason, the membrane is damaged by the contaminant and must be replaced. These problems are avoided by use of the multicomponent membrane of this invention, this membrane being substantially immune to damage by contact with contaminants such as those mentioned above. The multicomponent membrane of this invention is made up of a polymeric substrate membrane and a coating in contact with the substrate, the substrate membrane preferably being in the form of a hollow fiber. The polymeric substrate is the type described in U.S. Patent 4,230,463 and is preferably formed from a polysulfone polymer. The substrate membrane is preferably in the form of a hollow fiber having an outside diameter of about 200 to 1,000 microns and a wall thickness of about 50 to 300 microns. The polysulfone substrate membrane is porous, the average pore cross sectional diameter varying within the range of 5 to 20,000 Angstroms. The pore sizes are greater in the interior of the membrane and lesser near the surfaces of the membrane, such that the membrane is anisotropic. The porosity of the substrate membrane is sufficient that the void volume of this membrane is with in the range of 10 to 90, preferably about 30 to 70, percent based on the superficial volume, i.e., the volume contained within the gross dimensions of the porous separation membrane. The coating in contact with the porous substrate membrane is the condensation product of silanol terminated poly dimethylsiloxane and a cross linking compound as defined herein. The dimethylsiloxane has, prior to cross linking, at least two terminal hydroxyl groups.The thickness of the coating will be in the range of 5,000 Angstroms to 50 microns. One advantage of using the cross linking agents of this invention is that the condensation reaction which is used to cross link the dimethy silaxane is not inhibited in the presence of certain materials. The curing of the dimethylsiloxane of U.S. Patent 4,230,463 without the cross linking agents of this invention is inhibited by the presence of very small amounts of certain materials such as sulfur or sulfur containing chemical compounds, gamines and certain other nitrogencontaining compounds, acetic materials such as organic acids and silicone rubber catalysts. For example, the reaction by product of the peroxide catalyst in many heat vulcanized silicone rubber stocks is an organic acid.This same inhibition will occur when dimethyl siloxane is cross linked with an addition type crosslinker such as the alpha methyl styrene cross linking agent disclosed in U S. Patent 4,230,463. Failure of the dimethylsiloxane to cure will result in a defect in the coating of the hollow fiber membrane. Another advantage of using the cross linking agents of this invention is that the coating can be cured at room temperature and ambient conditions. When a vinyl type cross linking agent is utilitcd, the catalyst required to carry out the cross linking normally requires a curing temperature well above 1000C. For example, one catalyst useful in cross linking vinyl type compounds is 2 4 dichlorobenzoyl peroxide which normally requires a temperature of 1300 to 1600C for curing. The use of such temperatures would seriously damage or destroy the polysulfone substrate preferred in this invention. The polymeric substrate will begin to densify and lose its porosity above about 1200C, such that the permeation rate of the substrate will be substantially reduced.Even more substrate damage will occur at higher temperatures. It has been found that especially beneficial results can be achieved by using a cross linking compound having the formula R1M Si OR2 3 where R1 is CH3, SH, Cl, CF3, NCO EMI6.1 or N CH2CH2OH 2, n is CH2 , CH2tH2 or CH2CH2CH2 , and R2 is CH3, CH2CK3 orEMI6.2 While adhesion of the coating to the substrate is not essential to the good performance of the coated fiber, it is preferred that the cross linking agent also have the characteristic of good adhesion to the substrate.Such preferred crosslinking agents are aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, aminopropyltriethoxysilane, chloropropyltriethoxysilane, chloropropyltrimethoxysilane, mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane, mercaptopropyltriethoxysilane, isocyanatopropyltriethoxysilane, andN phenylaminopropyltrimethoxysilane. It is essential that the proper cross linking compound be used. Many cross linking compounds of various types are known.However, most of these are not suitable for the purposes intended herein. The cross linking compound selected must be such that the following requirements are met 1. The cross linked coating must be substantially more resistant to the attack of contaminants. 2. The cross linked coating cannot be brittle. 3. The cross linking of the coating cannot effect the permeation characteristics of the coating or the substrate membrane or the combination thereof. 4. The coating mast be capable of filling pores in the surface of the substrate membrane. 5. The cros iinked coating must not penetrate too aeepia iflL pores in vre substrate membrane. 6. The cross linked coating must not remain tacky after curing. 7. lhe coating must not cause the fibers to mat or adhere to each otter when assembled in a bundle. 8. The coating formulation must be stable. We have found that the above requirements are met by the cross linking compounds employed in membranes according to the present invention. The formulation for the coating to be applied to and cured on the membranes described herein may be made up of 100 parts of dimethylsiloxane diol having a molecular weight within the range of 10,000 to 200,000, 1 to 20, preferably 2 to 12, parts of the cross linking compound specified herein and 1 to 5 parts of a catalyst such as dibutyltin dilaurate. More preferably, the coating formulation will contain 8 12 phr carts per hundred parts of the dimethylsiloxane diol of the cross linking compound and about 1 phr of the catalyst. Other catalysts which can be used are tin octoate and dibutyltin diacetate. In carrying out the coating operation, a bundle of hollow fiber substrate membranes are positioned within an enclosure and the enclosure is filled with the coating mixture. After the coating mixture has been in contact with the fibers in the bundle for a sufficient time to wet and cover these fibers, the bundle is withdrawn and the solvent is allowed to evaporate at ambient conditions to cure the coating and thereby effect cross linking of the dimethylsiloxane diol. The coating self cures at ambient conditions. EXAMPLES 1 7 Polysulfone substrate membranes of the type defined herein, in the form of hollow fibers, were coated with silicones prepared from 100 parts of polyCdimethylsilox ane diol having a molecular weight of 101,500, 10 parts of the cross linking agents specified in the examples and 2 parts per hundred of dibutyltin dilaurate as a catalyst, the silicones being prepared in sufficient pentane to make a 1 percent solution. After curing the coating, the permeabilities of the membranes with respect to hydrogen t P l H23 and the separation factors aH 2 of the membranes, as a ratio of the permeability of hydrogen to carbon monoxide, were determined in a conventional manner.The fibers were then exposed to contami nants by being immersed in a mixture of 7 percent toluene and 93 percent n hexane, both commonly found contaminants which are known to severely damage coatings such as disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,230,463, and allowed to stand for 16 hours. The permeabilities and separation factors were again measured. The results are shown in Table I.

Patent 4,230,463, showed a substantial reduction in the separation factor after exposure to the toluenelhexane mixture. Adhesion was tested in all Examples by applying a 5 weight percent solution of the coating formulation in pentane, to a polysulfone substrate to form a coating on the film and allowing the coating to cure to tackless state. The coated substrate was then immersed in pentane for several minutes and then withdrawn. The coating was then rubber lightly with a finger to determine how well the coating adhered to the substrate. Coatings having good adhesion could stand in the pentane overnight without any signs of blistering or failing to adhere to the substrate. EXAMPLES 8 13 Polysulfone hollow fiber substrates as described herein were coated with a coating formulation arde up of 100 parts of poly di methylsiloxane diol and varying amounts of gamma aminopropyltriethoxysilane, the coating being applied by dipping the fibers in a bath of pentane containing one weight percent of the coating formulationTwo phr of dibutyltin dilaurate was used as a catalyst.The hydrogen permeability and separation factor of hydro gen with respect to carbon monoxide were then determined in a conventional manner. The coated fibers were then immersed for 16 hours in a 7193 toluenein hexane mixture and again tested for hydrogen permeability and HZ CO separation factor. The results are shown in Table II.

Adhesion of the silicone to polysulfone was evaluated after the composite films were exposed to the pentane. It should be noted that the ability or inability of the coating to adhere to the substrate membrane had little or no effect on the resistance of the coating to damage by the hexane toluene mixture. This indicates that, since no chemical bonding of the coating to the porous substrate membrane occurs, the substrate membrane may be made of some polymeric material other than polysulfone. Other polymeric materials suitable for making membranes for gas separations are known. However, the preferred polymer for making the substrate membrane is polysulfone In those cases where adhesion was poor, the coating did not actually fall off the film but merely formed blisters. EXAMPLES 26 32 Example 26 was a control example, the fiber used having no coating at all.
