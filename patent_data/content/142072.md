# GRINDING ROBOT

## Abstract
The grinding robot according to the present invention is, to be more precise, a playback system grinding work robot with which No. 1 arm 7 turning around an axis, No. 2 arm 8 pivoted on and turning around the head portion of said No. 1 arm 7 and an abrasive tool 9 attached to an axle 10 of the head of No. 2 arm 8 are provided, and has epock making functions which makes it possible to move the abrasive tool 9 automatically and freely to a given direction, and to apply this grinding robot work efficiently to the curved surfaces of the complicated shape workpiece 58 . Further, the grinding robot under the present invention has a unique table device 48 which is inclinable freely from a horizontal level to a perpendicular position and in consequ ence it is very easy to set the abrasive tool 9 face to face with the workpiece 58 surface and also to control a position and a motion of the abrasive tool 9 because the position of the workpiece 58 fixed on the table is almost unchanged by the aid of linkages when the table 48 is inclined. Furthermore, the grinding robot under the present inven tion has an original and unique structure that a hydraulic cylinder is fitted to the head portion of No. 2. arm 8 and its ascending and descending motions can be controlled at the time of tool retirement, and that a playback control device functioning at the time of said tool retirement is built in the mechanism.
