# Continuous counterflow wood pulp fiber washing mechanism and method.

## Abstract
A continuous counterflow wood pulp fiber washing mechanism and method including a looped traveling forami nous wire 10 , a plurality of stock chambers 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 above the wire arranged sequentially in the direction of wire travel to provide a sequence of baths submerging the wire, pumps 40, 41, 43, 44 beneath each of the baths 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 following the first bath 12 for removing water drained through the wire and pumping the water back into the next upstream bath, means 9 for feeding stock into the first bath, and means 57, 58 for measuring the level of stock in the first bath 12 and for supplying fresh water to the last bath 17 as a function of the measured level, and pressing the stock between a roll 49 and the looped wire 10 in the last bath 17 and removing the stock from the roll 49 as it is carried upwardly out of the last bath 17 , and removing the wash from the first bath 12 through a discharge line 52 .
