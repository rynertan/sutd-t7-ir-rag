# Sheet sorters.

## Abstract
In a sheet sorter of the nesting bin type, the translatable bins 2 are driven so that there is an additional space 8 between the bin immediately on top of the sheet entry location and any superposed bins. This provides access to a corner of a set of sheets registered in that bin to a stapler 18 which is reciprocable between a remote position permitting free indexing of the bins and an inner position in which it can be operated to staple the respective set of sheets together.
