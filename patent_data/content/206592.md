## Description
This invention relates to hand exercisers and more particularly to exerciser devices for use in strengthening and therapy of the muscles of the forearm, wrist, hand and fingers. Hand exercise units, herein generally termed hand exercisers, are well known devices employed in the exercising of the muscles. The muscles are brought into operation in the forearm, hand, wrist and fingers as a result of contraction of the hand against the resistance of the hand exercise unit. This resistance is generally offered by steel elements under tension, such as springs, or by rubber balls to be gripped by the hand. These devices are intended to accommodate the hand but are generally limited to a single range of movement as the devices are forced to contract. This limited range of movement accordingly limits the benefit which can be achieved in carrying out exercises using such exercisers. The form of contraction resistance facility offered by the devices soon leads, on repeated use of the device, to those muscles which are exercised achieving a stale condition, nullifying any neuromuscular stimulation which has been achieved and correspondingly nullifying any progress which has taken place. There is generally no provision for accommodating with a single hand exerciser all of the movements associated with the parts of the anatomy in question. It is a universally acknowledged fact in physiotherapy that neuromuscular progress depends on the ability to stimulate muscles from different angles with use of different exercises and training principles. An attempt to provide such universal functionality is offered by FR A 1555007. Here, an arrangement of a perforated elastic membrane is proposed for re education of the fingers. It is generally to be used mounted within a rigid ring supported by a stabilising stand and tensioned by weighted cables passing over pulleys. This is overall a cumbersome, not readily portable system, the elastic membrane of which is apparently not a self supporting element. It is an object of the invention to provide a portable hand exerciser comprising an elastic membrane in a self supporting element and which provides for a wide variety of neuromuscular responses without the need for adjustment or resetting of the exerciser, which hand exerciser has utility both in physiotherapy and in muscular strengthening for sports purposes. According to the present invention, there is provided a hand exerciser for multi movement exercising of the muscles of the forearm, hand, wrist and fingers, which comprises a rigid frame spanned by a resiliently deformable web formed with an array of cells sized to accommodate the fingers of a human hand in a plurality of different spatial relationships and characterised in that the frame is freely holdable, in that the web is in a state of tension resulting from its being secured to the frame, the tension being locally variable by deformation of the web according to the positions of fingers inserted in the cells and in that the web is formed of thermoplastic rubber or elastic plastics elastomer having a Shore A hardness of 20 to 80 and an elasticity modulus of from 1 to 10 MN m². The material from which the web is produced will generally have in addition to the aforementioned physical properties, a tensile strength of from 7 to 35 MN m² and an elongation at break of 100 to 1000 . The Shore A hardness is particularly preferably from 40 to 60. The tensile strength is preferably from 10 to 30 MN m². A typical such material is the product MA198 from BTR Limited. The web may be of sheet form with openings stamped or otherwise formed therein or may be a mesh formed of strands of material as aforesaid crossing over at regular intervals and interconnected at the crossover positions. The webs themselves may be made from a wide variety of materials which meet the requirement of being resilient. In general these include elastomeric materials whether vulcanised or unvulcanised, cross linked or non crosslinked or containing a cross linked or partially cross linked component. The term vulcanised is used to imply the use of heat and possibly pressure in forming a three dimensional molecular network, whilst cross linking covers the formation of a three dimensional molecular network at any temperature. The composition utilised to produce the web having physical characteristics as aforesaid may contain the usual additives for providing protection against water, ozone and weathering, reinforcing fillers, inert fillers, colourants, antiabrasion agents etc. The shape of the cells is not important, it being merely necessary that they should accommodate the fingers comfortably. The grid will possess a sufficient number of cells to provide alternative positions for of the hand, each of which positions will result in different muscle operations occurring when when the exerciser is operated with the hand in each such position. The cells may be triangular, circular, rectangular, square, hexagonal or octagonal as desired. The most comfortable grip is achieved with cells formed by stamping, moulding or otherwise in a web, the openings thus produced preferably being circular or square with rounded corners. The frame itself can be of any convenient shape, but is preferably circular or rectangular. A simple form of exerciser embodying the invention is formed by moulding of the web in a mould previously containing a rigid frame around which the moulding composition becomes disposed and cured. This is a particularly suitable procedure when the web is of sheet form, such a form of exerciser being relatively inexpensive to produce and nevertheless capable of permitting a wide variety of muscle movement according to direction of stressing, thickness of web and percentage area of cells in the vicinity of the cells through which the fingers are placed. Different sectors of the exerciser can be subjected to a different tension by forming the frame from separate rigid elements held in an outer frame which is continuous, which rigid elements are held at different distances from the centre of the web. The outer frame can be provided with adjustable tensioning devices connecting it to the inner frame elements, which tensioning elements can be set to varying the spacing of the inner frame element from the centre of the web to the desired extent for applying different tensions to different sectors of the web. Whether the frame has merely a range of different tensions in different sectors preset to specific values or whether these values are variable at will, it can be seen that a device is provided which can offer a variety of resistances to the user who can thus work up through different tensions during a period of operation, with there merely being the need to ensure that one moves the hand to sectors of appropriate tension. If preset and fixed different tensions are provided, sectors of the web can be colour coded accordingly. Alternatively, as a result of the provision of means for varying the tensioning by the user of the exerciser, all the sectors can be set to the same tension which can be varied from time to time as required according to the exercising programme being carried out and or to enable the exerciser to be used by different people and advantage then taken simply of the different types of exercise permitted by a single tension web. For a better understanding of the invention and to show how the same can be carried into effect, reference will now be made by way of example only to the accompanying drawings wherein Referring to Figure 1 of the drawings, the hand exerciser shown therein comprises a web 1 formed as a mesh held within a rigid circular frame 2. The mesh defines a plurality of openings or cells 3 sized to receive the fingers and thumb of the human hand inserted into adjacent or non adjacent openings 3. The form of hand exerciser shown in Figure 2 comprises a like type of web 1 housed within a rectangular frame 4 held in an outer circular frame 5 by means of wing nutted screw threaded elements 6 passing through openings in the outer frame 5 to enter internally screw threaded tubular elements 7 centrally positioned on each of the sides of the frame 4 to hold the frame 4 in position and place the web under tension as the screw connection is tightened. The hand exerciser of Figure 3 differs from that shown in Figure 1 in that the frame 2 is formed as four segments 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d of equal circumferential length and each separated from the adjacent segments by a gap 8. As the frame can itself be forced out of planarity, the scope for exercising the hand with such an exerciser is considerably increased. The frame segments are shown formed with openings 9 in which screw threaded tubular elements 7 as shown in Figure 2 can be fitted in producing the form of hand exerciser shown in Figure 4 which can be regarded as combining the features of Figures 2 and 3. As a result of each of segments 2a to 2d having its own screw threaded tension adjuster screw, different areas of the web 1 can be subjected to differing tension and or uniform tension can be achieved over the magnitude of any such tensioning depending on the adjustment of the screw threaded members 6. Finally, Figure 5A and its cross section at X X shown in Figure 5B shows a hand exerciser formed as an integral moulding comprising a sheet 10 of a rubber composition moulded over and between a circular ring 11 and formed with an array of apertures 12 each sized to receive a finger or thumb. The rubber moulding composition, like the material of which the strands of the web 1 shown in Figures 1 to 4 are made, will have a Shore A hardness of 20 to 80 , an elasticity modulus of from 1 to 10 MN m², a tensile strength of from 7 to 35 MN m² and an elongation at break of 100 to 1000 . In order to utilise the hand exerciser of the invention, the fingers are inserted into the web openings 3 or apertures 12. As resistance is applied to the fingers by the web, appropriate muscle groups are employed to overcome this resistance. Thus, by using one or both hands, twisting, pulling, pushing movements may be applied to the hand exerciser. By using one or more fingers it is possible to contract the grid in various ways in carrying out scissor movements, curling and related motions. The level of resistance felt within the hand exerciser may, in some of the aforementioned embodiments, be varied by appropriate use of the tension adjuster screws. In the case of the embodiment of Figures 5A and 5B, a different level of resistance will be felt at different parts of the web, depending particularly on the influence of any unapertured marginal region of the web. Indeed the device, if large enough, may also be used by two individuals simultaneously, each placing the fingers into the cells in one area of the grid and then applying tension in opposite directions. The hand exerciser of the invention is a useful accessory for sufferers of arthritis and rheumatism and may be used in physiotherapy in hospitals. It may also be used in exercising or training by persons whose sporting activities require the use of the hand and forearms, wrist and fingers and is expected to be of special benefit to persons who play golf, cricket, tennis, judo, gymnastics, baseball, swimming, skiing, wind surfing and mountaineering. It is conservatively estimated that over twenty exercises can be performed efficiently with the hand exercisers of the invention, as well as approximately thirty physiotherapy training principles. The following list of exercises is indicative of those which may be carried out using an exerciser embodying the invention As a guideline with regard to schedules on the web, choose 3 5 exercises and do sets of them and repeat for at least 5 minutes 2 3 times per week, more often if higher performance levels are desired. After 6 8 weeks the muscles will need a change of routine and appropriate exercises may be chosen to make up a new schedule. Many more variations and combinations of the exercises described here can be carried out. Practically every known physical training principle can be utilised on the Exerciser, i.e. super sets, tri sets overload, forced reps, pyramids etc.
