# A RELAXATION OSCILLATOR TYPE SPARK GENERATOR

## Abstract
The spark generator 10 includes a spark transformer 16, an energy storage capacitor 20 connected across an AC supply from terminals 11, 12 , and an SCR 25 connected across the transformer capacitor circuit for discharging the capacitor and generating a spark at 18 . The transformer capacitor circuit is connected to the AC supply in series with diode circuit 31 through which the capacitor is charged to the peak voltage of the AC supply and the diode circuit is shunted by an SCR firing control circuit 21, 33, 28 through which current flows when the voltage across the diode circuit reverses to fire the SCR during the same half cycle as the capacitor is charged in.
