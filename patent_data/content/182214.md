# Parachute system and aircraft ejection seat incorporating the same.

## Abstract
A parachute system for an airman ejected from an aircraft in an ejection seat includes at least one drogue parachute 9 housed within a rigid hollow container 10 . In conventional manner, the drogue parachute is connected by lines 30 with releasable attachments on the seat, one of the lines 30 being further connected with the main parachute so that the latter will be deployed after release of said attachments. The con tainer 10 is formed as a projectile mounted in a gun 18 mounted on the ejection seat. The container has, at its end fac ing away from the direction in which it is fired, a closure 16 connected with the lines 30 and with the drogue parachute. When the container 10 and closure 16 are fired from the gun 18 , and the closure 16 is arrested abruptly by the lines 30 , the container 10 continues in its trajectory whilst the drogue parachute is drawn from the container and deployed by the lines 30 . After the drogue parachute has left the container 10 the container is completely free from the other compo nents and can thus separate completely from the airman and the parachute system. The inventive arrangement avoids the risk presented by conventional systems in which a drogue bul let remains connected with the system presenting a hazard to the airman.
