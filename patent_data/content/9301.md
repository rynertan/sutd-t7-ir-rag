# Plasticized butene 1 polymer compositions and biaxially oriented film thereof.

## Abstract
Crystalline polymers of butene 1 are plasticized with specific liquid hydrocarbons. The plasticizer is prepared by dimerizing an alpha olefin containing 8 to 12 carbon atoms and then hydrogenating the dimer. The compo sitions are useful for production of biaxialyl oriented films.
