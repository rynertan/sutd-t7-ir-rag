# Process of reducing blowing cycle for blow molded containers and resultant container.

## Abstract
A change in the bottom c√∂nfiguration of a blow mold 22 and bottle 26 formed of a plastics material which compensates for shrinkage in the bottom structure due to improper cooling whereby the improper cooling may be advantageously utilized to provide for a marked decrease in the blow molding cycle time.
