# Prism optics and optical information processing apparatus.

## Abstract
An optical system for converting shape of a light beam by making use of refraction of prisms comprises a prism optic which includes a complex prism 10 11 constituted by com bination of at least two types of prisms 10A, 10B 11A, 11B made of materials differing from each other in respect to dispersion of refractivity. An optical information processing apparatus includes the optical system employing the prisms. Geometric optical properties of the optical system is insus ceptible to being changed irrespective of changes in wavelength of the light beam brought about by dispersion in oscillation wavelength of a light source, change in the course of time lapse, change in ambient temperature and or change in emitted light energy. With the optical system, information processing is realized which is insusceptible to the influence of the change in wavelength of the light beam.
