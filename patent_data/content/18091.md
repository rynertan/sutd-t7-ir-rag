# A semiconductor device having a plurality of semiconductor chip portions.

## Abstract
A semiconductor device used, for example, for the amplification of microwave signals, comprising a plurality of semiconductor elements 41, 42 mounted on a base 1 and connected parallel to each other in order to gain high output power, wherein the same type of corresponding electrodes 5, 6 of the adjacent semiconductor elements are directly connected to each other 3, 9 so that self oscillation does not occur in the device and the operation thereof is stable.
