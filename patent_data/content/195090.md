## Description
Raising Trestle Garage for Parking Cars and System and Method for Establishing such a Garage The present invention relates to an original system and a method for establishing a multifloor garage for parking cars, preferably performed using profilated sections and rolled sheets of metal, comprising a very small number of elements that may be prefabricated, also in mass production, and that are assembled to form a wide number of trestle garages of various capacity. Moreover, it is an object of the present invention a raising trestle garage for parking cars having an increased capacity for receiving cars and presenting the possibility of continuously driving in and driving out, also continuously. One of the basic characteristics of this invention is that it permits continuous admittance and parking of cars and simultaneously exit of other cars already parked, due to the existence of two helical ramps, mutually staggered by 1800, having a width to allow the passage of only one car, and which, surrounding the various parking saloons form a stiffening element of the whole structure.One of the two ramps passes all the entrances to the saloons of the even floors and the exits of the odd floors, the second one passes the exits of the even floors and the entrances of the odd floors. In this way, the parking saloons are always entered from the same side and are left towards the opposite side which results in the advantage that, while the cars one after the other go up on one ramp, to be parked in the various saloons, simultaneously the cars go down on the other ramp to leave one after the other. In this way, one obtains a continuous and simultaneous movement of cars in entering and in leaving without any interference between the two flows with the possibility of managing the parking by only one person that, in addition to assigning a place to every entering car, may collect the parking taxes based on the duration of stay using a computer which also controls the signalling lights. The flow of the cars may be directed alternatively from the even floors to the odd ones and vice versa by means of suitable traffic lights which may be operated either automatically or on command of the keeper. The admittance of the driver for taking back his own car of for leaving having parked it is allowed through a suitable elevator which may reach every floor. Moreover, an emergency staircase is provided which, disposed outside of the saloons and the lanes, is accessible and utilisable in every emergency case. The invention is now explained referring to the annexed drawings which are shown for illustrative purposes only and in which Fig. 1 is a top view of a garage according to the invention Fig. 2 is an axial section through a garage according to the invention Fig. 3 is another axial section through a garage according to the invention Fig. 4 is a top view of a portion of a garage according to the invention Fig. 5, 6 and 7 are detail views for a garage according to the invention. The structure forming the trestle of a garage according to the invention presents modular characteristics such that one can augment the capacity of the garage at will by increasing the number of modules forming it, while it always remains composed of the same structural elements which can be prefabricated using proper tooling as to be assembled without further working. The trestle bearing base consists of a casting of reinforced concrete connecting all the pillars, also made of reinforced concrete fig. 2 and 3, detail 2 in which the anchoring structural steels of every column are embedded, either the main beams of Shape fig. 2 and 3, detail 1 or the ones of E shape supporting the lanes and simultaneously stiffening the main columns fig. 2 and 3, detail 6.The anchoring structural steels, also prefabricated, are positioned by means of suitable jigs and form the starting point for assembling the whole structure. The main columns, preferably consisting of beams of H sbape, form the boundary for the two sides of the superposed car parking saloons, the length of which is equal to a multiple of a module. Each of these columns haves in corrispondence with and connected to each floor, bolted thereto two beams profilated in E shape fig. 2 and 3 and fig. 5 and 6, detail 3 in turn connected by a large overlapping flat bar ig. 6, detail 16 fixed by a number of bolts that are, at the same time, screwing the profilated beam of E shape 3 the flat bar 16 and the diamond floor plate 4 having the length of a module and consequently connecting three beams, the distance between one column and the other being equal to one half of a module.To the four columns, disposed in the corners, one single beam of C shape fig. 1, detail 10 is bolted which in the central portion of its length is stiffened by two columns which also consist of beams profilated in g shape fig. 1, detail 11 and which define the limits for the space of admittance to the parking saloon from one side and that of the exit from the opposite side.The length of these two sides has a fixed value, regardless of the dimensions of the trestle garage, it corresponds to three modules plus an extension or an elongation with every module at the ends, resulting in a greater length of the saloons with respect to the length of the diamond floor plate or a multiple of it. If the module is four meter in length, there is an elongation of one meter at each end, as shown in fig. 4, which represents a corner of the lanes with three gores connected to a special safe crash 1 and to three columns of E shape 2 . The lanes are forming a double screw, so they are staggered by 1800 they start from the ground level, one in correspondende with the admittance to the parking saloon on the ground level, the other one in correspondence with the exit from the same parking saloon, and both are rising with the same inclination such that the first one, after half a spiral, reaches the exit of the first floor parking saloon, while the second one, after half a spiral5 reaches the admittance to the first floor parking saloon. The lanes, in the form of a spiral, surround the column fig. 4, detail 1 and are anchored thereto by an original safe crash fig. 4, detail 17. It rises higher than the ground of the lanes thus preventing the wheels of the cars from crashing into the column t iwhile extending under the same helical ground thus presents an anchoring point for the three gores originating from the curve thus formed connected to the columns of the corner while being bolted to five columns of r shape fig. 4, detail 2 on the outside. The safe crash 17 on the side facing the parking saloon header where the lane gets wider to allow the car to take the curve normally is lengthened to the same value as the two exterior modules of the parking saloon header. In this manner, the components of the lanes remain standardized, since the difference is compensated by the third gore representing the curve Continuing with the same inclination the two lanes reach the uppermost floor provided on top of the trestle garage. The lanes are supported by beams of g shape like those of the saloons but having smaller dimensions and being bolted to the main column of E shape on their inner portions and to the corresponding column of t shape at their other ends. These beams are doubled, as are those of the saloons, at the ends of each module, whereas those ones bolted to the intermediate columns of the module are simple. The ground of the lanes, disposed in correspondence with the sides of variable length, consists of two diamond floor plates, placed side by side, identical to those of the ground of the saloons, in the central portion, whereas at both sides a plate bent through one quarter of a cylinder is provided which also has the length of one module and is bolted to the beam and to the column thus forming another stiffening element while forcing the car to remain in the central portion of the lane. The lanes, in correspondence with the two trestle headers, are widening as to facilitate going through the curves at the four corners and simultaneously to enter and leave the saloons. The curves are formed by three gores having a form illustrated in fig. 4. On three sides each gore is provided with a 900 bend. Those three sides are the exterior side fig. 4, detail 3 one of the two sides crossing the lane 4 and the short side 5 connecting the same gore with a special safe crash 1 which, apart from serving as a connector between the three gores and the corner column, also has the function of a fender preventing the car from touching the corner column.As to the fourth side, that of the goreI rests on the beam 18 also supporting the diamond plates, that of the gore II rests on the border of the gore I, whereas the fourth side of the gore III rests on the border 22 of the gore II. In the middle section of each gore a stiffening rib 6 19 is welded thereto connecting the internal bend 21 and the external bend 20 in correspondence to the bolting fixing the gore to the outer column 2 of g shape and to the safe crash 1 . The three gores are standardized for all the capacities of the threstle garages. The curve obtained in this manner is protected towards the outside by four sections of a simple cylindrical rail fixed to the five columns to which also the three gores forming the curve are bolted. In this manner, the exterior columns disposed in correspondence with each curve are connected to portions of the guard rail of sheet metal having a simple cylindrical curvature. The side towards the narrow helicline of the first gore rests on the last bean 7 of the same lane, whereas the bent side of the last gore faces the enlarged helicline through which the edge itself is bolted to the outer column 2 to which the first beam of r shape is bolted on which the edge 4 of the metal sheet forming the last gore and also the diamond plates are bolted forming the ground and being in a slight inclination over the length of one module, after that last gore the foot place starts also having the length of one module and being disposed on the same level as the ground of the corresponding saloon.The third gore, by its bent edges, is connected to the safe crash 17 and to the columns 2 and to the beams of r shape 23 from which the diamond plates forming the ground of the floor, with slight inclination, start for the first of the three header modules. The first one of the remaining two lies flat and on the same level as the ground of the corresponding saloon, whereas the other one presents a slight inclination like the first one and is connected to its end by the gores forming the curve. The lane of a short side is completed by a second diamond floor plate module in a slight inclination like the preceding one and is followed, as described above, by three gores forming the curve of the lane. In the foot place, in correspondence with the entrance to the saloon, the lift opening fig. 1, detail 12 is provided completely closed by a shielding plate having its doors facing the foot place. The lift opening is within the foot place with one half and outside thereof with the other half, and this last section forms the supporting structure for an emergency staircase 13 having three flights from floor to floor. The whole skeleton of the trestle garage is provided susceptible to be protected by an antifire paint, and the portions subjected to trampling are protected by an abrasive resistant paint. Also, a version is provided allowing a higher ratio of cars per square meter designed with the same system and based on the same principle of a double screw turning around two parking saloons which, in that case, are provided side by side along the variable length side. The trestle garage according to the invention is composed of a system of elements which may be prefabricated.and may be assembled by means of screwing in a simple manner and at low costs according to a simple mounting method. The mounted garage is of strong structure and may be operated by one single person such that aiso the costs of operation are low.
