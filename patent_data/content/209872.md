# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR ULTRASONIC INTERFACE DETECTION

## Abstract
An unloaded ultrasonic horn assembly is driven at its re sonant frequency. As the horn encounters an interface and becomes loaded a feedback signal representative of this fact is generated. An output signal responsive to the loss of the feedback signal provides an indication of the encountering of the interface.
