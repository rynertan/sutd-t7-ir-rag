# Device to form crop into round bales.

## Abstract
A device for forming crop lying on the field into round bales, said device mainly comprising a frame 2 , movable across the field and having two relatively spaced walls 6 , a group of guiding and stretching members 9, 10 arranged between and supported by said walls for guiding and main taining the tension of one or more endless, belt like elements 7, 8 and means 21 for picking up the crop from the ground, wherein a group of supporting members 24 connected with a wall is arranged inside the space bounded by an endless belt element 7, 8 , which supporting members are disposed in a circle so being able to urge the endless beltlike element against the supporting members at a given volume of received crop so that the yielding movement of the belt like element is limited and rupture of the belt is avoided. Neverthe less right from the beginning of the bale formation the core of the bale is exerted to pressure so that the bale has a uniform density throughout its volume.
