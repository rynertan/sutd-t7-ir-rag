## Description
AIL S FOR TKE BLIND AND VISUALLY HANDICAPPED AND USE THERi OF This invention relates to aids for use by blind and other visually handicapped persons. It is known for a blind person when walking forwards to use an aid in the form or a so called long stick, which is straight and in some cases can be collapsed for transport. The user, whilst walking forwards, holds the stick downwardly and forwardly, and swings the stick from side to side to sense vertical obstacles, and also taps on the ground to sense changes in ground level, e.g. a road kerb, It will be appreciated that unlese forward progress is very slow, some vertical obstacles and changes in ground level will be missed and in general a user will restrict his forward speed to a level which enables most obstacles to be sensed.Prolonged use of the stick can produce fatigue in the user s arm According to this invention an aid for the blind and visually handicapped comprises an elongate member, ground engaging roller means for the elongate member, and probe means extending transversely of the elongate member for detecting obstacles. With such an aid, obstacles and ground changes can be sensed by a user. The invention also includes a method or walking using such an aid with the elongate member extending torwards. Preferably probe means are adapted to extend laterally of the elongate member, the probe means being deflectable and on release arranged to return to its lateral position. With such an aid, a user can rendily sense vertical obstacles and changes in ground level on a continuous basis whilst moving forwardly. The aid is most effective if there are two probes adapted to extend laterally respectively on both sides of the elongate member If the roller means comprises two laterally spaced rollers this is particularly useful in locating the elongate member at right angles to a step or kerb In one embodiment the probes are inherently resilient and comprise a plastics tube with an inner RTI ID 2.15 fibre glass rod. Preferably, for ease of transport and convenience on buses and the like, the probe means is retractable to a which position extends generally towards the other end of th elongate member. Conveniently the probe means ii retracted through a linkage connected to an operating element by a rod extending along the elongate member, and releasable detents are preferably provided to resist undesired retraction and extension of the probe means. The invention may be performed in various ways and two specific embodiment with possible modifications will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig.1 is a perspective view of an aid for blind or other visually handicapped persons Fig.2 is an enlarged perspective view of part of the aid Fig.3 is a part section of part of the aid Fig .4 is a section on the line 4 4 of Fig.3 Fig.5 is a side view, part in section, of an end of a probe and Fig.6.is a part side view of part of a modified arrangement. The aid comprises a atrzight rigid lightweight elongate member 10 formed from square or other section aluminium or plastics extrusion. A cylindrical rod not shown is releasably received in the upper end of the member 10 and is secured in place by a bolt extending through the rod and the member 10 and held in place by the bolt and a wing nut 11. Other forms of releasable fastener could be used to hold the rod. The rod extends beyond the member 10 and has removably secured to it by nuts and bolts 12 a directional hand grip in the form of a pistol grip 13 formed in two halves 13a, 13b each moulded of plastics, for example acrylonitrile butadienestyrene. The two halves are secured together by nuts and bolts 14. The grip has a trigger like rest 8 for the index finger and grooves 15 for the other Ringers. A flexible plastics strip 16 has one end held in the hand grip and the other end is apertured to receive the bolt of bolt and wing nut 11. There may be a number of spaced apertures in the strip 16 so that its effective length can be adjusted. The strip forms loop 17 with the grip so that a user may place his arm through the loop 17 to carry the aid. It will be observed that the loop 17 is located 8o that when the aid is in use the hand or arm does not extend through the loop so that the user can readily relsase his hold on the grip if desired for example if the aid becomes trapped. At the lower end the member 10 is riveted at 9 to bent or cranked element 18 of aluminium or plastics sheet having apertures 19 to reduce its weight and increase strength and rigidity. The lower end of the member 10 receives a plug not shown and a horizontal hollow rod 20 f ixedly extends through the plug, the member 10 and side edges 21 of the element 18. Two laterally spaced rollers or wheels 22 are rotatably carried on the ends of rod 20. The wheels 22 are very light in weight and are made for ezcample from foamed plastics, for example ethyl vinyl acetate.They have wide flat road engaging surfacas 23 this enables a user to sense slight changes in ground texture and level and assists in directional stability and preventing the aid from wandering from a etrvightrorwarde direction of movement.A long single roller extending across the aid could be used in some cases instead of the two rollers but two rollers are preferred. The element 18 has a slot 24, in line with the member 10, in which can slide a pin 25. The pin 25 is pivotally connected to the inner ends of left and right links 26, 27 of linkage 7 above the element 18 and whose outer ends are pivotally connected at 28, 29 to left and right square section links 30, 31 themselves pivoted respectively at 32, 33 to the element 18. Nylon washers are interposed between the relatively moving parts at the pivots. Connected to the ends of linka 30, 31 are resilient elongate probes or sensors 34, 35 which operate in a manner somewhat similar to the whiskers of z cat. The inner ends of the sensors extend through the respective link and are releasably held by rubber bush 36. Each sensor comprises an outer tube 37 of nylon plastics and an inner rod 38 of fibre glass. The exterior surface of the tube is smooth, and is designed not to snag in clothing. The tube has pn integral locating flange 39. A tip portion 40 of plastics is screwed at 41 into the end of the tube 37 and is provided with a tactile marker in the form of an annular groove 42 when the tip portion has worn down to the groove 42 a user will know it should be replaced.Although the bush 36 holds the sensor firm, tne bush can be removed by a user and the probe or sensor withdrawn and replaced, the bush being then attached to the end of the probe. The flange 39 engages the 14 DE. to indicate to a user when the probe is in place. The assistance of a sighted person is not required. A stainless steel rod 43 extending along member 10 connects the pin 25to a cylindrical portion 44 screwed into an operating element in the form of a knob 45. A spring 46 is engaged between the knob 45 and a stainless steel washer 46a and biasses the knob outwardly. A slot 47 is provided in the underside of the member 10 with enlarged portions 48, 49 at its lower and upper ends, In the position shown in Figs .2 and 3 the knob is in portion 48 and the probes 34, 35 are retracted to be inclined towards the member 10.The length of the slot 47 and the fact that the pivots are supported from beneath enables the probes to be retracted through more than 900 to bring the tips of the probes close to the member 10 thus reducing any tendency for the retracted probes to catch in obstacles or against t hs legs of a user. The portion 44 has side flats 50 so that, on depression of the knob, the knob can be moved upwardly as shown chain dotted into the portion 49 causing. the pin 25 to move upwardly along the slot 24 bringing the probes 34, 35 to the operative position shown in Fig.1 in which the probes extend laterally of the aid. The engagement of portion 45 in slot portions 48, 49 provides a releasable detent. The knob must be depressed before it can be moved out of slot end portions 48, 49.In the arrangement shown, the user is left handed so that right hand probe 35 is made longer than probe 34, so that probe 35 extends to beyond the right side of the user. The distance between the tips of the probes in the extended position is at least equal to the width across the widest part of a user 8 body, usually the shoulder, and in use the tips extend slightly outwardly of the respective shoulders so as to sense obstacles across the full width of a user8 body. DitRercnt users can have probes of differing lengths. If the user were right handed then probes g4, 35 would be interchanged.As can be seen from Fig in the operative condition the linkage 7 holds the probes in front of the axle rod 20 but not in front of the foremost surfaces of the wheels 22, so that in use it is the wheels which will first engage a vertical or upstanding surface in front of the user. To use the aid a user holds the grip with his hand at his side and walks forward with the rollers 22 engaging the ground. The user can sense, through the wide groundengaging surface of the rollers, changes in ground level, changes in ground texture, e.g. water, gravel, ice, gaps between paving stones, and grass and vertical obstructions, and should a probe engage an obstacle it flexes rearwards as shown chain dotted in Fig.2 this flexing can also be sensed by a user whose forward progrese is thus facilitated and the danger of collision with obstacles reduced. The probes can flex or bend through well beyond 900 and have effectively 100 recovery, that is they return to the lateral, operative, condition when the flexing force is removed.The resilient nature of the probes biassew them to the unflexed position of Fig, . When a step or road kerb is reached, the rollers can be lowered whilst being kept in contact with the front face 51 of the step riser until the rollers engage the next tread 52. This is facilitated by the generally flst element 18 being downwardly inclined with respect to the member 10. The arrangement has certain advantages when compared with a conventional straight long stick as used by the blind and other visually handicapped. This sick is moved to and fro from side to side, and is tapped on the ground in a sequence of positions. Thus changes in ground level or in the nature of the ground may be missed and not all vertical obstructions will be engaged with the stick unless forward progress is made very slow. With the described arrangement the rollers sense ground level and surface characteristics at all times and the probes and wheels sense vertical obstructions in the path of the user.The directional hand grip reduces any tendency to veer away from a directly forward path as can happen with a conventional stick which inclines to left or right due to muscle fatigue in a user 8 arm. It will be seen from Fig.1 that the two wheels 22 enable the aid to be located with the member 10 at right angles to the edge of the step or kerb, which is not easily achieved with a conventional stick. As a safety feature the member 10 is provided with alternating coatings 53, 54 of light reflective pressure sensitive material, for example saturn yellow fluorescent and super high intensity reflective as supplied by Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co. of London. The aid is light in weight being generally made of aluminium and plastics and may weigh for example 800 grams or less. The aid is entirely corrosion resistant and rust proof so that the aid can readily be cleaned under a tap or hose by a user without the assistance of a sighted person. In a modification the probes are not retractable but extend laterally the linkage is omitted and the probes are releasably connected to the lower end of the elongate stem 10 above the wheels. In some circumstances it may be possible for the aid to have a single, longer, probe extending to one side of the aid but two probes are preferred. It will be appreciated that the described aid, unlike a conventional straight stick, is such that a visually handicapped person does not require lengthy training and practice before being able satisfactorilly to use the aid. In a modification shown in Fig.6, the index finger rest 8 is pivoted at 60 to the handle and is movable outwards to the chain dotted position under the control of a relay 61 energised by battery 62 through lines 63,The battery is replaceable through removable ond cap 64.The relay is connected, through line 66 in element 10 to sensor 65 carried on element 18. The sensor 65 is a sound transmitter receiver and is energized from the battery and is arranged to emit 4n ultrasonic probe beam generally vertically and includes means responsive to sonic reflections from overhanging obstacles. The beam could be circular, or fan shaped in a lateral plane. The sensor is arranged to passs a pulse to the relay when an obstacle is sensed of a height, for example, of up to 1.8 metres above the height of axle 20, but not above that height.When the relay is energised by the pulse it causes the rest 8 to move outwards providing a tactile indicaton of the presence of the obstacle. The relay is re set manually.An on off switch not shown is provided. In a further modification means are provided for sensing the distance travelled. Thewheel hubs 67 are cast and have six equi angularly spaced radial vanes 68 on the inside.A suitable light source 69 carried on element 18is responsive to light reflections from the vanes and includes counting means arranged, after successive predetermined rotations of the wheel, to send a pulse through line 69 in element 10 to micro electric motor 70 energized from the battery through a connection not shown and arranged to index one or more of three wheels 71 arranged on a common axis in the handle and partly projecting from the handle. Each wheel carries Braille symbols for 0 to 9 and can be sensed by the index finger to give a user an accurate indication of the distance travelled. This is particularly useful when, for example, crossing a road. An on off switch not shown is provided. The fibre glass rod 38 generally of smaller crosssection than the tube has larger diameter portions at its ends, being held to the tube at the inner end and free to move longitudinally relative to the tube at the outer end during flexing of the probe.
