## Description
This invention relates to isolation apparatus, and particularly to an isolaton apparatus for supporting a sensor housing on a surface to which linear and rotational vibrations are applied. The application of various sensor technologies to vehicles in motion such as aircraft, air vehicles and space vehicles as well as to other surfaces exposes the sensors to vibrations. These vibrations are defined as the continuous and non continuous, periodic and non periodic accelerations which result in changes in displacement about the fixed axes of the sensors. Such vibration when coupled to the sensor may cause undesirable effects to the information provided by the sensor, as by masking and altering the signal therefrom. In the case of a sensor which oscillates at a frequency responsive to a selected parameter to be sensed, vibration from such external surface may alter or fully obscure the oscillation responsive to the selected parameter. Such vibrations may be linear and or rotational. Where the sensor is sensitive to certain of such vibrations, the sensor must be isolated from those vibrations in order to obtain intelligible information therefrom. A vibrating sensor means, such as used in a vibrating wire or beam sensor, for example, may be sensitive to all external linear vibrations and to external rotational vibrations perpendicular to the longitudinal plane of such vibrating member. Elastomeric material such as rubber in various forms is known as a vibration isolator. Similarly, it is known that placement of elastomers about the periphery of a sensor housing having a vibration sensitive sensor therein reduces the effects of certain vibrations. For example, in the apparatus shown in Figure 1 of the drawings, rubber columns 4 are mounted on the front and rear facing sides of a housing, these columns then being rigidly affixed to a selected surface to support the housing in a desired position. When a linear vibration acts on the surface and is transmitted to the housing through the columns along the X axis of the housing, two columns are in compression and two columns are in tension. However, a vibration acting force along the Y axis or the Z axis causes all four columns to be in shear. Due to the very nature of the rubber, it typically provides a stiffer response in compression or tension than in shear. Additional columns only add cost and provide further coupling means for the unwanted vibrations to the housing. Linear vibrations along the Y and Z axes are isolated, but rotational vibrations caused by the movements about the stiff linear axis X provide additional problems as such linear vibrations about linear axis X can be converted to rotational vibration C. The structure of Figure 1 is effective only partially against rotational vibrations C about the Z axis, as the four columns are in a combination of compression tension and in shear responsive to such vibration. In DE B 1136743 there is disclosed an isolation apparatus for supporting a sensor housing on a surface to which linear and rotational vibrations are applied, the housing having three mutually perpendicular axes X, Y, Z , the apparatus comprising According to this invention such an apparatus is characterised in that each mount has two opposed support surfaces each supporting an elastic means and in that each said support surface of a mount, and each said first surface of a corresponding bracket are oriented to support the respective separate elastic means relative to the housing such that rotational vibration about said third axis Z results in compression and or tension of all of the elastic means. With the apparatus of this invention isolation of a sensor from rotational vibration is improved by reducing angular acceleration about a desired axis of the sensor housing by placing all the elastic means in compression and or tension. This invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the drawings, in which An apparatus according to the present invention is shown generally at 10. An enclosed housing to be isolated and which preferably is a sensor housing comprising a sensor and other components such as mounting components and transducer components is shown at 20. Housing 20 is formed in a conventional manner preferably from a metal material. Brackets 22, which may be formed when housing 20 is made as by forging and machining, or which preferably are formed separately as from a metal or other suitable material and then attached to the housing by welding, brazing or other known mounting techniques, are fixedly coupled to housing 20 at a surface 24 of brackets 22. A surface 26 of brackets 22, which preferably is chamfered consistent with the geometric shape of the housing, which in a preferred embodiment of Figs. 2 and 3 is a rectangular parallelepiped, is chamfered at an angle W with respect to one of the axes as shown the Y axis which preferably is between thirty five degrees to fifty five degrees but preferably is forty five degrees when the sensor is symmetric and when the sensor is located in the center of housing 20. In one preferred embodiment of Figs. 2 and 3 an angle W of forty nine degrees was used to adjust for symmetry. An elastic block of material 28 also shown in Fig. 4, which may be columnar and preferably is a rectangular parallelepiped, is formed to conform to surface 26 at a first edge 30 and is supported on surface 26 and preferably is bonded thereto by a suitable bonding agent. Elastic material 28 preferably is formed from a highly dampened silicone rubber, or an elastomeric material preferably Hidamp Registered Trademark of Barry Controls as manufactured by Barry Controls, Watertown, Massachusetts. A second edge 32 of material 28 is also formed to conform to and be supported by one end 34 of mount 36. End 34 is also chamfered, but at angle W with respect to the X axis W is also in the range of thirty five degrees to fifty five degrees, and preferably is forty five degrees, but in one preferred embodiment of Figs. 2 and 3 when W was forty nine degrees, W was forty one degrees. By using angles of forty nine degrees and forty one degrees adjustment for sensor symmetry was accomplished. A plurality of sensors may be included in housing 20. In that case, the angles W and W should be optimized to obtain the least vibration sensitivity in accord with the sensors symmetry and the eccentricity of the sensors centers of gravity from the housing 20 center of gravity. It is observed then that surface 26 of bracket 22 conforms to and provides support for first edge 30 of materials 28, and, similarly, that end 34 of mount 36 conforms to and provides support for second edge 32 of material 28. This lateral support on two sides of material 28, or sandwiching of material 28 between surface 26 and end 34 at the angles W and W , as desired, provides for compression of material 28 along two axis of linear vibration that is vibrations in the plane formed by the X, Y axes and about one axis of angular vibrations of housing 20 here the rotational axis C . Since the two angles sum to ninety degrees material 28 is rectangular in cross section, 20 thereby simplifying compression stress analysis of the material 28. Mount 36 preferably is then secured to a surface 38, such as an air vehicle frame or instrument housing frame which is subjected to vibration, as by mounting bolts and nuts, suitable bonding material or other conventional means. Conventional external coupling means, such as pressure, differential pressure, electrical and optical couplers are schematically shown at 40. It is noted that the sway space, the distance from housing 20 to the isolation apparatus, should be adequate to preclude contact therebetween during the applied vibrations. This vibration isolation apparatus with a column of elastic material 28 disposed radially outboard of at least four diametrically opposed corners has demonstrated satisfactory results in the 1G to 3G acceleration range. In the prior art, it is known that vibration is reduced by minimizing coupling conditions in two basic ways, first by reducing the eccentricity of the elastic center of the vibration isolation system from the center of gravity of housing 20 and, second, by decoupling the six modes of vibration, that is, the three linear X, Y, Z and the three angular A, B, C vibration modes shown in Fig. 5, however, this is a difficult, complex problem often resultant in complex, expensive solutions. In the case of a sensor sensitive to all three linear accelerations and sensitive to a singular angular vibration, this inexpensive solution of positioning brackets 22, elastic material 28 and mounts 36 outboard of the four corners of housing 20 at an angle between thirty five and fifty five degrees as shown in a preferred embodiment of Figs. 2 and 3 results in low sensitivity to at least two linear vibrations e.g. X, Y and a substantially reduced linear vibration conversion to angular vibration e.g. C as all blocks of materials 28 are in compression. In one preferred embodiment, when housing 20 was approximately 1.2 inches high, by 2 inches long, by 1.8 inches wide, the housing, having a vibrating member type sensor was exposed to significant cynamic, random vibration, shock and steady state acceleration. Performance of the isolation dampening system of brackets 22, elastic material 28 and mounts 36 positioned in accord with a preferred embodiment of Figs. 2 and 3, when 3G to 3G positive to negative three times the force of gravity was applied in all three axis of housing 20, was fully satisfactory. Operation and construction of one such vibrating member is fully explained in US A 4311053. In the tested embodiment, the natural frequency of the three linear translational X, Y Z axes and the three rotational 16 A, B, C were It is seen that the rotational vibration e.g C was effectively decoupled from the linear vibration e.g. X and Y by having a high natural frequency about C and a lower natural frequency for X and Y. This necessarily caused a lower but acceptable linear natural frequency for Z. As explained, the natural frequency of C was improved by increasing the C stiffness as all material 28 is in compression responsive to such vibration. The shape factor S , where S is equal to the loaded area of the elastic material 28 over the force free area, permits the ratio of elastic material 28 in compression to elastic material 28 in shear to be adjusted. As shown herein, the shape factor is adjusted by having the material 28 at angles W and W to yield approximately the same resonant vibration frequency for vibration along any axis of the plane formed by the two linear axes X and Y of the embodiment of Fig. 2 and 3. Hence, the shape factor is adjusted to provide an X and Y axis resonant frequencies approximately equal to the X and Y axis resonant frequencies, respectively, wherein the X and the Y axis are rotated between thirty five to fifty five degrees from the X and Y axis respectively. When angles W and W are forty five degrees, the resolved linear vibration force along the X and Y axis causes in at least two of the four elastic materials 28 to be in compression and the remaining two to be in shear responsive to such resolved vibrational force or acceleration. Quite obviously, this invention may be utilized with other sensors and housings and for other apparatus where vibration or acceleration control is desired. Also, it is apparent that the invention may be used to control vibration and accelerations for different axes as desired.
