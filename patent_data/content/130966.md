# Cross linked polyphenylene oxide.

## Abstract
Cross linked polyphenylene oxide compositions com prise the reaction product of an alkyl halogenated phenylene oxide polymer and ammonia. The cross linkage between phenylene groups is benzyl amine linkage represented by the structural formula CH₂NHCH₂ . The cross linked polyphenylene oxide is useful as a membrane.
