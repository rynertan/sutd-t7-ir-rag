# HYDRAULIC CONTROL POWER SUPPLY IN MULT RATIO AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSIONS

## Abstract
In a multi ratio automatic transmission, the different ra tios are selected by hydraulically engaging friction means BR3, BR4, BR5 under the control of hydraulically energis ed control means. Hydraulic power for energising both the control means and the actuators for engaging the friction means is derived from the same source 13a, c . The actu ators are supplied from a feeding circuit 42 through relay valves RV controlled by the control means. A main press ure regulator MPR is arranged to maintain substantially full working pressure P1 in a priority pressure circuit 36 , which is connected to the relay valve RV supply ports through a constricted passage 200, 300 for each relay valve RV4, RV3 and non return valve means 206 are ar ranged to prevent flow through the constricted passages to the feeding circuit 42 . With this arrangement, the pressure P1 in the priority circuit P36 can maintain the pressure in the actuator of an engaged friction means despite a reduc tion in pressure PK in the feeding circuit 42 when the lat ter is required to supply a relatively large and unrestricted flow to take up the slack in another actuator with a view to engagement of the friction means associated with the said other actuator.
