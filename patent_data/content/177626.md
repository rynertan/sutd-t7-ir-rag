# System for online detecting transformation value and or flatness of steel or magnetic material.

## Abstract
In a system for online detecting a transformation value and or a flatness of a steel or a magnetic material, an exciting coil 13 disposed at either one side of the plate shaped steel 1 or magnetic material as being the material to be measured and capable of generating alternating mag netic fluxes by alternating current excitations two or more detecting coils 15₁, 15₂ arranged on the same side as the exciting coil 13 and at positions different in distance from the exciting coil, and mutually induced with the exciting coil and an arithmetic unit 17 for obtaining the transformation value and the flatness of the steel or the magnetic material or either one of those from a difference between detection signals generated from a difference in values of interlock magnetic fluxes 14₁, 14₂ in the respective detecting coils are provided, so that the transformation value and the flat ness of the steel or the flatness of the magnetic material can be detected with high accuracy.
