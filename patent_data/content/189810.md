## Abstract
The formation of carbon on metals exposed to hydrocar bons in a thermal cracking process is reduced by contacting such metals with an antifoulant selected from the group consisting of a combination of tin and copper, a combination of antimony and copper and a combination of tin, antimony and copper.
