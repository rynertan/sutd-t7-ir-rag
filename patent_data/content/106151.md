U.S. 3,950,401 teaches sulfonation of low molecular weight polymers of 250 500 molecular weight prepared from propene or butene as lubricating oil anti rust additives. U.S. 4,086,171 teaches a block copolymer of a sulfonated monoalkenyl arene such as styrene, with an unsaturated olefin such as butadiene, said polymer being selectively hydrogenated and then sulfonated, and which can be reacted with ammonia or amines to form a V.I. detergent additive for lubricating oil. U.S. 1,246,545 teaches dehydrohalogenating a chlorinated olefin polymer such as polyisobutylene of about 20 to 150 carbons, and then sulfonating and neutralizing with a metal base or amine to form a detergent additive for lubricating oil.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In contrast to the above patents, the present invention is directed to crank case lubricants containing polymers which are oil soluble and not water soluble, which are sulfonated but without requiring the presence of chlorine, which are aliphatic and do not require aromatic groups in the polymer which are reacted with metal compounds to form a multifunctional V.I. improver dispersancy additive and do not require the use of a cosolvent, and which can provide a plurality of sulfonate groups on the polymer, and which contain ethylene. The present invention therefore provides a crankcase motor oil composition comprising a major amount of a lubricating oil, zinc dialkyl dithiophosphate, a lubricating oil ashless dispersant and 0.1 to 10 wt. of a hydrocarbon soluble sulphonated ethylene polymer having a number average molecular weight in the range of 5000 to 1,000,000, said sulphonated polymer comprising 30 to 84.5 mole ethylene, 15 to 69.5 mole C3 to C18 alpha olefin and 0.5 to 20 mole C5 to C14 diolefine formed by sulphonating said ethylene polymer with a nonchlorine containing sulphonating agent to form sulphonic acid groups, said sulphonated polymer being at least partly neutralized with a metal compound.

On a weight basis usually at least 2 wt. of the terpolymer will be the diolefin and many commercially available polymers will contain about 3 to 5 wt. diene.

In general, the preparation of copolymers or terpolymers suitable for the practice of this invention by means of Ziegler Natta catalysts is known in the prior art for example, see U.S. Patent Nos. 2,933,480 3,000,866 and 3,093,621. These polymers, which are primarily produced for use in elastomeric compositions, are usually characterized by the substantial absence of chain or backbone unsaturation while the nonconjugated dienes define sites of unsaturation in groups which are pendant to or are in cyclic structures outside the main polymer chain. Ethylene propylene nonconjugated diolefin EPDM terpolymers are known articles in commerce.Various examples of such commercially available copolymers or terpolymers are VISTALO X an elastomeric copolymer of ethylene and propylene, or terpolymer of ethylene, propylene and 5 ethylidene 2 norbornene, marketed by Exxon Chemical Co., New York, N.Y. and NORD N , a ter polymer of ethylene, propylene and 1,4 hexadiene, marketed by E.I. du Pont De Nemours Co., Wilmington, Del. These commercial polymers, which are usually high molecular weight elastomers, may be further modified by mastication, extrusion, milling, heating, etc., in order to break down their molecular weight to different grades optimum for various oil or fuel additive uses. A typical EPDM terpolymer of ethylene, propylene and a diene monomer is VISTALON 2504 Exxon Chemical Co. , a terpolymer having a Mooney viscosity ML, 1 8,.2120F of about 40 and having an ethylene content of about 50 wt. 8 and a 5 ethylidene 2 norbornene content of about 5.0 wt. .The Mn of VISTALON 2504 is about 47,000, the Mv is about 145,000 and the Mw is about 174,000. Another EPDM terpolymer VISTALON 2504 20 is derived from V 2504 Exxon Chemical Co. by a controlled extrusion process, wherein the resultant Mooney viscosity at 212 F is about 20. The Mn of VISTALON 2504 20 is about 26,000, the Mv is about 90,000 and the Mw is about 125,000. NORDEL 1320 DuPont is another terpolymer having a Mooney viscosity at 2120F of about 25 and having about 53 wt. of ethylene, about 3.5 wt. of 1,4 hexadiene and about 43.5 wt. of propylene. The preferred EPDM terpolymers of this invention have a number average molecular weight Mn of about 5000 to 500,000, usually about 10,000 to about 200,000, more preferably of about 15,000 to about 100,000, most preferably of about 20,000 to about 60,000. The Mooney viscosity ML, 1 8, 2120F of the EPDM terpolymer is about 1 to 60, e.g. 2 to about 50, more preferably about 3 to about 40, and most preferably about 5 to about 40. The Mv of theEPDM terpolymer is preferably below about 350,000 and more preferably below about 300,000. The Mw of the EPDM terpolymer is preferably below about 350,000. The neutralized sulfonated elastomeric polymers of this present instant invention further include degraded or cracked ethylene propylene copolymers or EPDM polymers. While the invention is primarily directed to sulfonating an ethylene containing hydrocarbon polymer and then at least partly neutralizing with a metal compound, which material is used in oil compositions, equivalent materials may be formed, in some instances, by direct synthesis of hydrocarbon monomers with sulfonate or neutralized sulfonate monomers, to give equivalent compositions, which are contemplated as being within the scope of the present invention. Sulfonation One means for carrying out the polymer sulfonation is to first dissolve the polymer in a substantially nonreactive solvent including mineral lubricating oils such as white oil, or even lubricating oils containing some aromatics such as solvent neutral oils eg, Solvent 100 Neutral, Solvent 150 Neutral, etc., chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbon, chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbon, aliphatic hydrocarbons, etc. Some specific examples include carbon tetrachloride, dichloroethane, chlorobenzene, cyclohexane, pentane, isopentane, hexane, isohexane or heptane, etc.A sulfonating agent is added to the solution of the elastomeric polymer and nonreactive solvent at a temperature of about 300C to about l000C, over a period of time ranging from as quickly as possible, e.g. a few seconds to about 60 minutes, more usually at about room temperature for about 1 to about 45 minutes, e.g. about 1 to about 30 minutes.Typical sulfonating agents are described in U.S. PatentNos. 3,642,728 and 3,836,511, incorporated herein by reference. These sulfonating agents are preferably selected from an acyl sulfate, a mixture of sulfuric acid and an acid anhydride or a complex of a sulfur trioxide donor and a Lewis base containing oxygen, sulfur, or phosphorus. Typical sulfur trioxide donors are SO3, sulfuric acid, oleum, etc. Typical Lewis bases are dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, triethylphosphate, etc. The most preferred sulfonation agent for the invention is an acyl sulfate selected from the group consisting essentially of benzoyl, acetyl, propionyl or butyryl sulfate. The reaction can be quenched with an aliphatic alcohol such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, with an aromatic hydroxyl compound, such as phenol, a cycloaliphatic alcohol such as a cyclohexanol or with water. The acid form of the sulfonated polymer will generally have about 1 to about 60 meq. milliequivalents S03H groups per 100 grams of sulfonated polymer, more preferably about 1 to about 50 and most preferably about 2 to about 31. The meq. of S03H 100 grams of polymer is determined by both titration of the polymeric sulfonic acid and Dietert Sulfur analysis.In the titration of the sulfonic acid the polymer can be dissolved in a solvent consisting of 95 parts of toluene and 5 parts of methanol at a concentration level of 50 grams per liter of solvent. The acid form can then be titrated with ethanolic sodium hydroxide to an AlizarinThymolphthalein endpoint. The resulting sulfonated polymer, preferably in solution, e.g. in the aforesaid solvent used to carry out the sulfonation such as mineral lubricating oil, can be readily reacted with the metal compounds by mixing together at 30 to 100, preferably 0 to 600C, for from 10 minutes to 30 hours, preferably 10 minutes to 10 hours, usually about 15 minutes to about 3 hours. For large scale use, it is particularly preferred to form a solution of the starting polymer in solvent preferably a mineral lubricating oil , then sulfonate the polymer and then neutralize, to thereby form a concentrate of the final neutralized sulfonated polymer while avoiding the need to strip off the solvent.The Metal Neutralization The neutralizing agents include the metal hydroxides, metal carbonates, metal alkoxides having about 1 to about 8 carbon atoms or metallic salts of C1 to Cl8 carboxylic acids, wherein the metal is selected from the group including iron, aluminum, antimony, lead and Groups I A, II A, I B and IIB of the PeriodicTable of Elements and mixtures thereof. Alkali metals and alkaline earth metals are preferred. The neutralization agents, which can be dissolved in water or alcohols or mixtures thereof, are added to the cement of the sulfonated elastomeric polymer thereby neutralizing the sulfonate groups, Useful examples of metal hydroxides are NaOH,KOH, Lion, Mg OH 2 and Ba OH 2. Useful carbonates are the alkali metal carbonates .The carboxylate ion of the metallic salt of the carboxylic acid can be derived from the carboxylic acids including fatty and aromatic acids such as acetic, benzoic, lauric, palmitic, myristic, decanoic, octanoic, and stearic, etc. Preferably, neutralization of some or all, such as 25 or more of the acid groups of the acid form of the sulfonated polymer is carried out by the addition of a solution of metal acetate to the acid form of the sulfonated polymer which is dissolved in the mixture of aliphatic alcohol and non reactive solvent. The metal acetate is preferably dissolved in water and or an aliphatic alcohol or solvent. Typically, but non limiting metal acetates are sodium acetate, barium acetate, magnesium acetate, aluminum acetate, potassium acetate, lead acetate, and zinc acetate, etc. Sufficient neutralizing agent is added to the solution of the acid form of the elastomeric polymer to effect neutralization of the S03H groups. It is preferable to neutralize at least 50 , e.g. 95 of the acid groups, more preferably about 98 , most preferably 100 . While it is preferred to neutralize the acid form of the sulfonated polymer before its use in lubricating oil compositions, actually partial or complete neutralization can be parried out in situ in the lubricant. Thus, many lubricating oil compositions contain metal compounds, e.g. metal salts, such as overbased metal alkylaryl sulfonates or alkyl phenate sulfides.These overbased materials are generally colloidal dispersions of metal carbonates formed by blowingC02 through an oil dispersion of metal base, such as lime,Mg0, etc., suspended in the oil with a surfactant such as metal alkylaryl sulfonate, etc. If the acid form of the sulfonated polymer is added to a lubricant containing metal compound, particularly basic metal compounds such as metal carbonates present in overbased sulfonates, then the sul fonic acid groups of the polymer will tend to form the sulfonate metal salts in situ from these other metalcontaining additive materials.Thus, metal neutralized sulfonate polymers as defined herein, include both those which are preneutralized before mixed with other lubricant additives as well as those where the metal neutralization takes place in situ by reaction of the sulfonic acid groups of the polymer with other metal containing additives. These polymers are incorporated into automotive crankcase lubricating oils, in concentrations within the range of 0.01 to 10 weight percent, e.g. 0.1 to 7 weight percent, preferably 0.2 to 5.0 weight percent, based on the weight of the total composition together with the zinc dialkyl dithiophosphate and overbased alkylaryl sulphonate.The lubricants to which the products of this invention can be added include not only hydrocarbon oils derived from petroleum but also include synthetic oils such as alkyl esters of dicarboxylic acids, polyglycols and alcohols polyalphaolefins, alkyl benzenes, organic esters of phosphoric acids, polysilicone oil, etc. The zinc dialkyl dithiophosphates contain 3 to 8 carbon atoms in each alkyl group. The additive may be conveniently dispensed as a concentrate comprising a minor proportion of the additive, e.g. 5 to 45 wt. , dissolved in a major proportion of a mineral lubricating oil, e.g., 95 to 55 wt. , with or without other additives being present. In the above compositions or concentrates, other conventional additives may also be present, including dyes, pour point depressants, antiwear agents such as tricresyl phosphate, antioxidants such as N phenyl naphthylamine, t. octyl phenol sulfide, 4,4 methylene bis 2,6 di tertbutyl phenol , other viscosity index improvers such as ethylene propylene copolymers, polymethacrylactes, polyisobutylene, alkyl fumarate vinyl acetate copolymers and the like, as well as other ashless dispersants such as the polyisobutylene succinic anhydride reacted with amines, hydroxy amines, polyols, etc., metal detergents such as carbon dioxide overbased metal akylaryl sulfonates which also may serve as anti rust agents, etc.Forming the Oil Compositions The sulfonate products, in general, are difficult to dissolve in oil, and may require long dissolving periods, elevated temperature, vigorous agitation, etc. Preparing concentrates is usually even more difficult. It has been found that using other oil additives may facilitate dissolving the neutralized sulfonated polymers into mineral oil.For example, adding the polymers to lubricating oil, along with 0.2 to 6 parts by weight, preferably .5 to 3 parts by w eight of said other additive, per part by weight of the neutralized sulfonated polymer, may materially decrease the dissolving time. The addition of these amounts of the other additives may also be useful in reducing the viscosity of the composition. This is particularly useful when making concentrates and additive packages as larger amounts of sulfonated product can be incorporated into the oil without making the concentrate unduly viscous so as to interfere with ease of handling or subsequent blending. Oil soluble alkyl hydroxy aromatic sulfides, such as alkyl phenol sulfides, which are conventional lubricating oil antioxidants, may be used as a dissolving aid to facili tate oil solubilization of the metal derivatized sulfonated polymer. These sulfides are generally formed by react ing alkylated phenolic or polyhydroxy aromatics having 1 to 3 OH groups, e.g. alkyl phenol or dihydroxy benzene e.g. resorcinol ,setc., with 1 to 3 alkyl groups of about 2 to 20, usually 8 to 12 carbons each, with sulfur or sulfur halides e.g., sulfur mono or dichlorides. Other materials that can be used to facilitate dissolving the nitrogencontaining sulfonates are lubricating oil ashless sludge dispersants, such as those formed by reacting long chain usually C2 to C5 olefin polymers substituted succinic anhydride or acid, e g. polyisobutenyl succinic anhydride, wherein the polyolefin substituent group, e.g. polyisobutenyl group, is about 50 to 400 carbons, with amines or hydroxy amines, with 2 to 60 carbons and 1 to 12 nitrogens , or with C1 to C40, e.g. C2 to C20 alcohols, including rolyols with 2 to 10 hydroxy groups. Such dispersants are preferably made by reacting polyethylenepolyamines, e.g.tetraethylenepentamine, tris hydroxymethylaminomethane TRAM pentaeçythritol, etc. with the polyisobutenyl succinic anhydride and are usually available in the form of concentrates of about 40 to 60 wt. 8 in mineral oil. Since the phenol sulfide antioxidant, and particularly the ashless dispersants may be used in forming the finished lubricant, by preblending them with the sulfonate they can be made to also facilitate the solvation of the sulfonate and to form additive concentrates or a finished lubricant.Thus, it may be advantageous to first blend into the oil the phenol sulfide andlor ashless dispersant before blending in the sulfonate polymer. A method of preparing these oil compositions,e.g. lubricating oil concentrates is by using 0.1 to 20, preferably 0.2 to 6, more preferably 0.5 to 3 parts by weight of the dissolving aid, such as the phenol sulfide, or ashless dispersant, per part by weight of themetal containing sulfonated polymer in the mineral oil, e.g., lubricating oil, at temperature ranging from ambient e.g. 250C up to about 200 CC and preferably up to about 100C below the boiling point of the cosolvent. A smooth, homogeneous gel like fluid or gel like semi solid additive blend can be obtained which becomes fluid on heating. This concentrate, in turn, can be further dissolved with added lubricating or fuel oil to form finished formulations at ambient or slightly elevated temperatures. This invention will be further understood by reference to the following examples, which include pre ferred embodiments of the invention. Prep rcftion of Neutral ised, Sulphonàted Poiymêrs. Part A Sulfonation 500 grams of V 2504 which had been masticate2 in the presence of air to a Mooney viscosity at 2120F 990C of about 20.5 were dissolved by stirring overnight in 5000 ml of hexane under a nitrogen blanket in a reactor. The reactor used in these Examples was a flask equipped with a stirring rod driven by an electric motor, a thermometer, a condensor, a dropping funnel, and a nitrogen inlet so as to maintain a nitrogen atmosphere during the preparation. The flask had a heating mantle, which was removable, e.g. when it was desired to cool the flask in an ice bath. V 2504 is a terpolymer of about 50 wt. ethylene, about 44,2 wt propylene and about 5.8 wt. of 5 ethylidene 2 norbornene, having an unsaturation of about 4 7.5 me. 100 grams. 24.58 grams of an acetyl sulfate containing solu tion sufficient to sulfonate the polymer to about 18.3 millimole 100 g dissolved in 105 ml of 1,2 dichloroethane were added dropwise to the reactor over a period of about 45 minutes with vigorous stirring. The acetyl sulfate was made up at OOC in an ice bath, while protected from mois ture, by adding 10.32 grams of 95 sulfuric acid to 16.54 grams of acetic anhydride and mixing.The acetyl sulfate was then dissolved in the l,2 dichloroethane. After the acetyl sulfate solution in the 1,2 dichioroethane was added, the mixture was stirred for an additional hour and then 430 ml df isopropyl alcohol were added to deactivate the reaction and stirred for about 10 minutes. The batch was then split into two parts of 2080 grams each which were treated as fpllows Part B Neutralization with Magnesium Acetate 11.77 grams of hydrated magnesium acetate, Mg C2H302 2.4H20, dissolved in 75 ml water, equivalent to 18.3 millimoles per 100 g. of polymer were added to a 2088 gram portion of the aforesaid sulfonated polymer solution, followed by mixing vigorously for one hour.One gram ofAmerican Cyanamid 2246 antioxidant was next mixed into the reaction mixture for 10 minutes. The reaction mixture was then steam stripped to remove solvent, washed three times with distilled water, filtered, and dried in a vacuum oven at 500C for one hour, overnight at ambient temperature and then for 24 hours at 750C. 157 grams of dried product Polymer 1 was obtained which analyzed 82.86 wt. carbon, 13.59 wt. hydrogen, 0.50 wt. sulfur and 0.53 wt. magnesium. Part C Neutralization with Sodium Acetate 9.01 grams of sodium acetate NaC2H302 in 75 ml of distilled water was added to 2080 grams of aforesaid sulfonated polymer solution following by vigorously stirring for one hour. One gram of said 2246 antioxidant was mixed in for 10 minutes followed by finishing as noted above withPart B, i.e. steam stripping, washing, filtering and drying. 213 grams of dried product Polymer 2 was obtained which analysed 83.40 wt. carbon, 13.44 wt. hydrogen, 0.54 wt. sulfur and 0.66 wt. 8 sodium. 250.0 grams of the masticated V 2504 used above were dissolved in 5000 ml of hexane in the reactor, as described above. 14.78 grams of acetyl sulfate, sufficient to sulfonate the polymer to about 22.0 milli mole 100 g polymer, made as described in Example 1 and dissolved in 50 ml 1,2 dichloroethane were added to the reactor over a period of about 50 minutes while vigorously the reaction mixture and stirred for 15 minutes. 11.80 grams of magnesium acetate tetrahydrate CH3COO 2Mg.4 H20 dissolved in 75 ml of distilled water was added followed by vigorously stirring for one hour. Then 0.5 gram of the American Cyanamid 2246 anti oxidant was added as an anti oxidant followed by mixing for 5 minutes. The reaction mixture was then steam stripped, washed, and filtered, as in Example 1.However, in place of using vacuum drying as in Example 1, instead an eight inch 2 roll heated polymer mill operating at a temperature of about 2400F 1110C was used to roll dry the polymer product Polymer 3 . 247.9 grams of final product was obtained having about 81.47 wt. carboy 13.79 wt. hydroxy 0.61 wt. sulfur and 0.42 wt. magnesium. Example 1 Sludge Inhibition Bench SIB Test The efficacy of the derivatized copolymers of this invention as dispersants in lubricating oil is illus trated in a Sludge Inhibition Bench SIB Test. The SIB Test has been found, after a large number of evaluations, to be an excellent test for assessing the dispersing power of lubricating oil dispersant additives. The medium chosen for the SIB Test was a used crankcase mineral lubricating oil composition having an original viscosity of about 325 SUS at 380C that had been used in a taxicab that was driven generally for short trips only, thereby causing a buildup of a high concentration of sludge precursors. The oil that was used contained only a refined base mineral lubricating oil, a viscosity index improver, a pour point depressant and zinc dialkyldithio phosphate anti wear additive. The oil contained no sludge dispersant. A quantity of such used oil was acquired by draining and refilling the taxicab crankcase at 1600 3200 km. The Sludge Inhibition Bench Test is conducted in the following manner The aforesaid used crankcase oil, which is milky brown in color, is freed of sludge by cen trifuoing for one hour at about 39,000 gravities gas . The resulting clear bright red supernatant oil is then decanted from the insoluble sludge particles thereby separated out.However, the supernatant oil still contains oil soluble sludge precursors which on heating under the conditions employed by this test will tend to form additional oilinsoluble deposits of sludge. The sludge inhibiting properties of the additives being tested are determined by adding to portions of the supernatant used oil a small amount, such as 0.5, 1 or 2 weight percent, on an active ingredient basis, of the particular additive being tested.Ten grams of each blend being tested are placed in a stainless steel centrifuge tube and are heated at 1380C for 16 hours in the presence of air. Following the heating, the tube containing the oil being tested is cooled and then centrifuged for about 30 minutes at room temperature at about 39,000 gs. Any deposits of new sludge that form in this step are separated from the oil by decanting the supernatant oil and then carefully washing the sludge deposits with 25 ml of heptane to remove all remaining oil from the sludge and further centrifuging. The weight of the new solid sludge that has been formed in the test, in milligrams, is determined by drying the residue and weighing it. The results are reported by comparison with a blank not containing any additional additive.The less new sludge precipitated in the presence of the additive, the larger the percent sludge that is dispersed, and the more effective is the additive as a sludge dispersant. In other words, if the additive is effective, it will hold at least a portion of the new sludge that forms on heating and oxidation stably suspended in the oil so it does not precipitate down during the centrifuging. Using the above test, the sludge dispersant activities of the preceding metal neutralized sulfonates are shown in the following Table at an active ingredient a.i. levels in the oil of 0.05 grams per 10 grams of oil and at 0.025 grams active ingredient per 10 grams of oil. For comparison two commercial dispersants were also tested. One was an ashless dispersant which was a polyisobutenyl succinimide of polyethyleneamine PIBSA PAM while the other was a multifunctional V.I. dispersant which was a copolymer of styrene and maleic anhydride neutralized with a mixture of alcohol and amine as described in U.S.Patent 3,702,300.

Polymers 2 with the higher level of sulfonation 22 milliequivalents per 100 grams of polymer increased the dispersancy effect relative to the corresponding magnesium salt of Polymer 2 which has a sulfonate level of 18.3 milliequivalents per 100 grams of polymer. Polymer 3 had a dispersant effect about comparable to the two commercial products used in this bench test. EXAMPI.E 2 EPDM terpolymer containing about 43 wt. ethylene, about 3 wt. of 5 ethylidene 2 norbornene with the balance propylene, having a Mooney viscosity tML 1 8, 2120r of 7 was sulfonated to 20 milliequivalents of mew. sulfonic acid and neutralized with magnesium in a molar amount equal to the molar amount of sulfonic acid groups.

The specific compositions were then tested for their viscometric properties, namely kinematic viscosity at 2100F. in Centistokes, and under the high shearCold Cranking Simulator CCS according to ASTM D 2607 72 method at OOC for viscosity in centipoises, as well as being tested for ASTM pour point and ASTM sonic shear breakdown. The results obtained are summarized in the following Table.

POLYMER IN FORMULATION 1.1 1.1 1.0 As seen by Tablell , sulfonation and neutralization has little effect upon the 00F viscosity of the polymer, but has a large effect on increasing viscosity at 2100F. It is very desirable to have this low temperature viscometric advantage since the low temperature low viscosity facilitates cold cranking and start up of the engine in cold weather, while the higher 2100F viscosity is desired in order to facilitate lubrication and minimize oil use during engine operation, and the greater this effect, the wider the cross grading of oils that can be obtained, e.g. l0W 40, 10W 50 or even wider. It is seen that the sulfonated polymer was superior to the commercial ethylene propylene V.I. improver in that it had better low temperature viscosity when formulated to the same 2100P viscosity level. Thus, the 20 meq. sulfonated and magnesium neutralized polymer gave a viscosity of 2350 cP at OOC in the Cold Cranking Simulator as compared to the higher viscosity of 2840 cP for the EP VIr even though the 2100F viscosities for both formulations were nearly identical. The pour point of the sulfonated polymer formulation was also good. Sulfonated polymers, e.g. EPDM, with about 25 to about 55 wt. ethylene are particularly preferred for use in oils requiring pour depressant, since higher ethylene contents above about 55 wt. ethylene tend to cause the ethylene copolymer, e.g. EPDM, to ad versely interact with many conventional pour point depressants and or the wax, e.g. see U.S. Patent 3,691,078.
