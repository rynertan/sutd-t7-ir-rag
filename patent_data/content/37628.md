# Process for the preparation of a diphenyl methane.

## Abstract
A process for the preparation of diphenylmethanes and especially of unsubstituted and allryl substituted diphenyl methanes such as diphenylmethane DPM itself and 2 benzyl toluene OBT which is an intermediate in the preparation of anthraquinone. The process involves the reaction of a benzene with an Î± chloromethyl benzene in the presence of sulphuric acid and a cationic surfactant, such as a long chain quaternary ammonium salt, or a non tonic surfactant susceptible to pro tonation under strong acid conditions, such as an alkoxylated alkyl phenol.
