## Description
The present invention relates to a device for voltage regulation for a radar system as set forth in the preamble of the claim. Such a device is known by DE A 29 32 791. Further, in EP A 72 153 a generator of short duration high power pulses is described which is operative to produce a series of very short high energy pulses by allowing a reactive network to charge periodically from a d.c. power supply over a relatively long interval, and then rapidly discharging the accumulated energy into a load. It is the principal object of the present invention to improve upon the stability of a radar system and particularly the transmitting stability thereof by providing an improved voltage regulator which allows overall improvements in the stability of the modulating signal V Another object of this invention is to provide an improved voltage regulator for a radar transmitter. These objects are attained, in accordance with the present invention in a device for voltage regulation in a radar transmitter as characterised in the claim. Radar transmitters are required to provide high reproducibility of a transmitted waveform so that modifications of the echoes received, in terms of phase and amplitude, can be evaluated to ascertain characteristics of the target. To maintain the square wave amplitude and phase of the transmitted waveform constant in time requires high short term stability of the modulated signal, of the radio frequency source and the final amplification stage. Figure 1 shows the block diagram of the principle of operation of a chain generating the transmission pulse. Cathode modulated power amplifiers are characterized by two parameters which stand for their amplitude and phase sensitivity as a function of the stability of the video modulating pulse V With the same power amplifier characteristics, the transmitting system is all the more stable the better the pulse to pulse stability of the modulating signal V Processing systems, at reception, are generally of the Moving Target Indicator MTI , Moving Target Detector MTD type so as to suppress fixed echoes and detest the moving ones, characterized by Doppler frequencies different than zero. Such systems require that the transmission rate varies from pulse to pulse or from group of pulses to group of pulses by an amount which, peak to peak, may reach up to 20 of the mean value. With very sophisticated modulators, we may expect transmission pulses stability of the order of 0.1 with acceptable circuit complexity. By using good power transmitting tubes and modulators having characteristics as those shown above, it is possible to assure a degree of stability of the characteristics of the RF pulses transmitted, such as to achieve, typically, an ability to suppress fixed echoes of about 40 dB. This value is a penalty of the order of about ten decibel with respect to what can be achieved taking into account the stability which could be required of the other elements of the transmitting and receiving chains and to the possibility of adopting sophisticated processing systems. Through the device which is described in the following we can achieve, for short term stability of line modulators used in transmitters for radar applications, and of which Figure 2 shows the conventional block diagram, substantial improvements which would not be possible otherwise. This may be verified by an analysis of Figure 5, which shows the time function of voltage V It follows that at the power supply output, together with the mains ripple at the mains voltage frequency, a load ripple having the same repetion frequency as the Pulse Repetition Frequency PRF will appear. Together they contribute in varying the charging transformer SCR trigger timing. To these variations, different values of the current circulating in the charging diode correspond, with consequential variation of the turnoff time Tn, and therefore of Δ V, and therefore of VA. In real life, if PRF is constant, Tn variations, and therefore those of Δ V, and finally of VA, are due to the load ripple alone. If PRF is not constant, then the load ripple is responsible for a further variation of the trigger time of the charging transformer SCRs to this, for each trigger, a different value of the current circulating in the charging diode and a consequential variation of turnoff time Tn corresponds. The result is a Δ V₁ variation and to a much lesser degree a Δ V₂ variation and ultimately a variation of V The device for which the patent is applied, solves the problem in a consistent and reliable manner it does not require for the diodes neither technological advances which may be unlikely, and at any rate costly, nor for the power supply operational characteristics which, more than demanding, are essentially unpractical. The idea behind the device herin presented is to provide a variation at low voltage of the signal governing the PFN charging circuit so as to compensate for the load ripple variations due to non constant PRF which are introduced into the modulators operation. The device is also capable of compensating for the mains ripple, as the integration network time constant is set equal to that of the high voltage power supply filter. This compensation, as can be seen in Figure 9, which for simplicity refers to a non resonant charge case, warrants that the voltage, and therefore the current circulating, present at the terminals of the charging diode, at the time of change of polarity, does not change from pulse to pulse of course it implies that we must add to the reference voltage an error waveform having amplitude and duration dependant upon the load ripple present at the output of the power supply and which may be derived from the sequence of the repetition pulses using the time intervals between subsequent radar triggers to reconstruct this low voltage error signal. The invention will now be described with the purpose of illustrating the device, which is not limited to the description, with reference to the figures attached The error signal reconstruction is achieved through the device shown in figure 2. It can be seen that the device has an input set reset circuit which generates a square wave having level 1 duration equal to PFN charge time and 1 Ø level equal to the radar frequency as shown in Fig. 3. To this end, the set level is controlled by the radar PRF and the reset trigger is generated by comparing PFN charge voltage and reference voltage. The output waveform from the set reset circuit, controls a switch 2 which discharges the integration network 3 to which it is connected for a time proportional to that of the PFN charging time and charges it for the full time elapsing between the regulating point and the next radar pulse. The integration network time constant is made equal to that of the high voltage power supply filter. The peak detector 4 charges up to the ripple peak value and provides a signal with an amplitude which varies proportionally with the radar PRF. This signal passes through a buffer circuit 5 , amplified by an amplifier 6 , inverted and sent to a summing network 7 which sums it to the reference voltage. This way we have a reference voltage which is corrected by a signal which updates, pulse by pulse, the comparison point with the high voltage divider within the comparator 8 . At the time when the comparison gives zero as a result, a synchronizing signal is generated by the trigger generator 9 , which blocks, through the control circuit 10 , the charging voltage of the PFN. This stabilising device, used on modulators within which there are very high voltages, is operating entirely at low voltages and relies upon simple manipulation of signals. It also has a very important propriety, in radar terms that of being adaptive for the repetition frequency. The stability of the modulator controlled by the device which is presented herein reaches values of the order of 0.01 with consequential capability to suppress fixed echoes of the order of 60 dB, with a recovery of 10 dB over solutions which are not equipped with the device described.
