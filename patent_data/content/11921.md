# Large scale integrated circuit generator chip for electronic organ.

## Abstract
An electronic organ or the like is provided with a plurality of large scale integrated circuit LSI chips 10 30 , each of which has six tone generators 50 capable of generating a frequency corresponding to any not on the organ. In accor dance with a preferred embodiment of the invention a suffi cient number of these chips 10 30 is provided so that there is one note generator for each key of the organ.
