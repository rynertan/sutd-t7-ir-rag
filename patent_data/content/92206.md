# Amplifier with broad dynamic range and improved power efficiency.

## Abstract
An amplifier wherein a differential amplifier DA is suppli ed with a small amplitude signal in a normal condition and a large amplitude signal in an abnormal condition. Resistors R₁₁, R₁₂ and diodes D₃, D₄ jointly act to judge whether the differential amplifier DA sends forth the small or the large am plitude signal the small amplitude signal is amplified by a small amplitude signal amplifying section 11 and the large ampli tude signal is amplified by a large amplitude signal amplifying section 12 . The large amplitude signal amplifying section 12 is supplied with a first source voltage B₂ B₂ . The small amplitude signal amplifying section 11 is impressed with a second source voltage B₁ B₁ and an output signal of the amplifier is supplied to a load A through an output terminal common to the small amplitude signal amplifying section 11 and the large amplitude signal amplifying section 12 . The first and second source voltages B₂ B₂ , B₁ B₁ are cho sen to have a following relationships B₂ B₁ B₂ B₁
