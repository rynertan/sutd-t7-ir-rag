# PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF POLYURETHANE POLYMER COMPOSITIONS

## Abstract
The invention is concerned with the preparation of polyurethane compositions in which the deleterious effect of gaseous by products formed in the reaction is minimised. This is achieved by the use of coupling reagents which incorporate a steric hindrance function. The latter does not interfere with the normal coupling reactions between the coupling agent and polymer matrix and filler material but it does prevent such reaction between the coupling agent and filler material as would cause release of low molecular weight compounds occluded by the filler. Since the release of low molecular weight compounds is avoided, the forma tion or evolution of gases which give rise to unwanted cellularity of the cured composition is at least minimised.
