# A method of making ink for ink jet devices.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to an ink for ink jet printers. The ink is first formulated in concentrated form, and in this form it is subjected to stressful operating conditions such as an elevated temperature. This stress causes particle forma tion. After filtration to remove these particles, the final ink formulation is prepared by including the ingredients which inhibit particle formation.
