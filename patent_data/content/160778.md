# Waterproof optical fiber cable.

## Abstract
An optical fiber cable comprising a water blocking layer, an optical fiber disposed inside the water blocking layer and a water blocking material filling the space between the water blocking layer and the optical fiber, the water blocking material having an apparent viscosity as measured in accordace with JIS K 2220 1980, 5.15 at 40 C, and a shear rate of 10 sec. ยน of lower than 3 10โด poise and also having a worked penetration as measured in accordace with JIS K 2220 1980, 5.3 at 25 C of 85 to 475.
