## Description
The present invention relates to a method of producing ethylene which comprises cultivating a fungal organism. Regarding the production of ethylene by micro organisms, an investigational research on 228 species of molds L. Ilag et al² Regarding the production of ethylene by organisms of the genus Regarding the pathways of ethylene biosynthesis, the pathway involving methionine in plants has been elucidated by D. O. Adams et al As regards The fact that the biosynthetic precursors of ethylene mentioned by these reporters are not uniform is clear evidence that the pathway of ethylene biosynthesis in microorganisms has not been established. As mentioned above, studies on the production of ethylene by microorganisms are still in the exploratory stage and there is no established theory about its biosynthetic pathway. For that matter, there is not known a method that can be practiced on an industrial scale to manufacture ethylene with the aid of micro organisms with sufficient reproducibility. The present inventors carried out a detailed investigation about the process of ethylene biosynthesis in microorganisms and obtained the following experimental results. Using ethylene producing microorganisms, namely 8 bacterial strains, 10 yeast strains and 7 fungal strains, their production rates of ethylene were measured by gas chromatography. Some of the data are shown in Table 2. In this experiment, the responses of the strains to L methionine were compared by growing them in the L methionine containing media shown in Table 1 and the corresponding L methionine free media. It was found that irrespective of a taxonomic distinction of bacteria, yeasts and fungi, all of the 24 ethylene producing strains tested responded to L methionine with the exception of The activity of ACC synthase, a representative enzyme in the methionine pathway in plants, was determined in As it was expected that unlike most other ethylene producers, Washed cells after 4 days of starvation culture were used. The cells of Several compounds that were considered to serve as substrates were added to the cell free extract A of Table 5 and the ethylene production rates were determined. As shown in Table 6, the ethylene production rate was highest with α ketoglutaric acid while there was substantially no production of ethylene in the presence of L glutamic acid or L methionine. The intrinsic substrate for ethylene producing enzyme seemed to be α ketoglutaric acid. the final concentration of protein in the reaction system 3.32 mg ml reaction medium 1 mM per reaction medium 25 C, reciprocating shaker method, 1 hr. Using the crude enzyme solution B of Table 5, obtained by ammonium sulfate fractionation and subsequent dialysis of cell free extract A , an enzymatic reaction with the substrate α ketoglutaric acid was conducted. As shown in Table 7, when there was no additive agent, the ethylene production rate decreased to about 1 10 as compared with the case of Table 6 where α ketoglutaric acid was added. Therefore, in order to clarify the factor lost by dialysis, an experiment was performed using the metal salts given in Table 7. As a result, it was found that divalent iron ion is necessary for activity of the ethylene producing enzyme. The optimum level of addition of ferrous sulfate was within the range of 0.05 mM to 0.3 mM. The final concentration of protein in reaction meduim 3.47 mg ml reaction medium To the effluent fraction C from the DEAE Sepharose CL 6B ion exchange column See Table 5 was added α ketoglutaric acid as the substrate, and the enzymatic reaction was conducted in the presence of ferrous sulfate as the divalent iron ion necessary for the reaction. As apparent from Table 8, there was no production of ethylene. The substances adsorbed on the DEAE Sepharose CL 6B ion exchange column were eluted on a sodium chloride gradient, and the ethylene producing enzyme fraction D emerging at about 0.15 mol NaCl was reacted with substrate α ketoglutaric acid in the presence of ferrous sulfate necessary for the reaction. As shown in Table 8, only a small amount of ethylene was produced. The above fractions C and D were admixed in equal proportions and the mixture was reacted with α ketoglutaric acid in the presence of ferrous sulfate necessary for the reaction. As apparent from Table 8, the production of ethylene was observed. As the chief component of fraction C is a low molecular weight substance which gave a positive ninhydrin reaction, it was suspected to be an amino acid. Accordingly, fraction D was admixed with casamino acid instead of fraction C and the enzymatic reaction was conducted. As apparent from Table 8, a large quantity of ethylene was produced. It appears, therefore, that fraction C is an amino acid and that a substantial proportion of this active component was lost by ammonium sulfate fractionation and dialysis. Instead of adding Fraction C or casamino acid, a variety of amino acids were respectively added to ethylene producing enzyme fraction D of Table 5 and the enzymatic reaction was conducted using substrate α ketoglutaric acid in the presence of ferrous sulfate necessary for the reaction. As apparent from Table 9, a remarkable quantity of ethylene was produced when L arginine was added. Therefore, L arginine in the aforementioned effluent fraction C was determined. As a result, about 0.05 mM of L arginine was detected. Based on the above experimental results, the active component of Fraction C was established to be L arginine. While such low molecular substances should have been lost in the course of dialysis in the purification process of Table 5, it appears that L arginine was adsorbed on the enzyme protein and remained in the fraction. The final protein concentration in reaction system 0.1 mg ml reaction medium The reaction was conducted at 25 C for 1 hr. Based on the above experimental results, an The above experimental results suggest that the pathway of ethylene biosynthesis in However, this pathway of ethylene biosynthesis holds true in Strains of the genus While Referring to Table 11, the ability to produce α ketoglutaric acid from carbohydrates was investigated by assaying the acid in the cells by paper chromatography and, when necessary, by combination of paper chromatography and Friedemann Haugen colorimetry. As to the enzyme activity to produce ethylene from α ketoglutaric acid, mentioned in Table 11, the activity was determined in the aforementioned Based on the above experimental results, it appears that the following conditions must be satisfied in order to produce a large quantity of ethylene as in the case of The production of ethylene in appreciably large quantities is only made possible by growing an ethylene producing strain having the above three physiological properties 1 to 3 under the above conditions 4 and 5 . Based on the above findings, the present invention is directed to a microbiological method of producing ethylene characterized by growing aerobically a fungal strain capable of producing ethylene from α ketoglutaric acid in the presence of L arginine in a medium containing at least 20 ppm of divalent iron ion to produce ethylene and harvesting the ethylene. In accordance with the present invention, there is employed a fungal strain capable of producing ethylene from α ketoglutaric acid in the presence of L arginine. Preferably, this strain has a strong ability to produce α ketoglutaric acid from carbon sources, high enzyme activity to produce ethylene from α ketoglutaric acid, and an ability to produce arginine. The above physiological characteristics cannot be ascribed to any genus or species and even vary among strains of the same species. Therefore, the above mentioned strain should not be defined in taxonomic terms in the field of microbiology but be defined in physiological characteristic possessed by individual strains. Suitable strains can be identified by the procedures disclosed in the foregoing description. Among the preferred genera of fungi is the genus As the medium for cultivation of the microorganism in accordance with the present invention, a medium containing at least 20 ppm of divalent iron ion is employed. The divalent iron ion is preferably added in the form of ferrous salt of an organic acid in the medium. When ferrous sulfate FeSO₄ 7H₂O is used as the iron salt, the preferred level of addition is within the range of 0.05 to 0.3 mM. In the medium, the divalent iron ion may occur together with trivalent iron ion and the trivalent iron ion contained in the medium may be reduced to divalent iron ion. As the basal medium, a conventional medium for fungi which contains carbon sources, nitrogen sources, inorganic salts and other nutrients can be employed. Various carbohydrates such as glucose, sucrose, maltose, starch, xylose, sorbitol, etc., alcohols such as glycerol, ethanol, etc., organic acids such as acetic acid and other fatty acids, and crude materials containing them may be used as carbon sources. The main raw materials which are particularly useful for the purposes of this invention are reproducible biomasses which are either naturally occurring or available artificially as byproducts, such as materials from agricultural, forest, fishing and animal industry activities, and active sludges from the biological treatment of public sewage, raw sewage, plant effluents or various industrial wastes enrichment cultures . Though it depends on the strains of organisms used, these main material may be dissolved, decomposed or otherwise pretreated as necessary. As nitrogen sources, there can be advantageously used ammonia gas, aqueous ammonia and ammonium salts. When a biomass is used as the main raw material, the addition of such nitrogen sources may not be essential. As inorganic salts, phosphates, potassium salts, magnesium salts, sodium salts, calcium salts, etc. can be routinely employed, although these may be dispensed with when a biomass is employed. The addition of vitamins and amino acids or of materials containing them such as yeast extract, peptone, meat extract, corn steep liquor, etc. may contribute to accelerated growth of the strain used or improved yields of ethylene. The cultivation of microorganisms is carried out under aerobic conditions, for example by aerated stirring or stationary culture, with the pH and temperature being controlled at pH 2 to 9 and 20 to 45 C, respectively. Thus, for each strain, the optimum pH and temperature are selected. As the cultivation is conducted for 1 to 10 days, a biogas containing a significant amount of ethylene is produced. The ethylene content of the product biogas is assayed as follows. A x 1 to 5 ml portion of the broth in the course of cultivation or at the end of cultivation is taken into a test tube with a total volume of V 10 50 ml and after closure with a sterile rubber stopper, the broth is incubated on a reciprocating shaker at 20 to 45 C for t 1 7 hours. Since the respiration rate varies with different strains, it is preferable to vary the parameters V, x and t so as to prevent oxygen deficiency during shaking. After the reciprocal shaking, y 0.1 to 2 ml of the gas is taken from the top plenum of the test tube using a gas syringe and subjected to conventional FID gas chromatography column temperature 50 C, injection temperature 100 C using nitrogen gas as the carrier gas. From the area under the FID trace the ethylene content E To separate the ethylene from the product biogas, the biogas is either adsorbed on a suitable adsorbent such as zeolite or activated carbon or contacted with a sodium hydroxide solution to remove the byproduct carbon dioxide gas and, then, absorbed on the above mentioned adsorbent, followed by desorption. The zeolite may for example be Molecular Sieves 4A Union Showa K. K. or Zeoram A 4, A 5 or F 9 Toyo Soda Industries, Ltd. . The activated carbon may for example be Molecular Sieving Carbon Takeda Chemical Industries, Ltd. . The following examples are intended to illustrate the present invention in further detail. The fungal strains preserved after allotment and those newly alloted from a stock culture collection were cultivated in the modified NB medium of Table 1 in the routine manner. Then, using the strains showing high ethylene production rates, their physiological characteristics were investigated in accordance with Table 11 and the strains meeting the requirements set forth hereinbefore were selected. These strains and their characteristics are shown in Table 12. Thus, other than For the purpose of verifying the route of ethylene production, the investigation according to Table 10 was conducted. The results are shown in Table 13. It was confirmed that all of the strains produce ethylene via α ketoglutaric acid. The influence of addition levels of a divalent iron salt to the medium for With an increasing concentration of the divalent iron salt in the medium, the ethylene production rate increased, and as the oxygen partial pressure at ethylene producing reaction was zero or anoxic, production of ethylene ceased to occur. A miniature fermentation jar of 2.6 ℓ capacity was charged with 1 ℓ of the modified NB medium of Table 1 and sterilized by autoclaving at 120 C for 20 minutes. After cooling, 50 ml of a culture of Throughout this incubation period, the discharge gas was passed through a 10 sodium hydroxide bath, water stripping bath and moisture separation bath in that order to remove impurity gases. The gas was further passed through a bed of Zeolam A 4 Toyo Soda to further adsorb and remove impurity gases and the effluent gas was guided into a column of Zeolam A 4 Toyo Soda and the adsorbed ethylene was desorbed by vacuum suction for recovery. The yield of ethylene was about 100 mg. The present invention is characterized in that the readily available, reproducible biomass, particularly the waste resources from agricultural, forest, fishery, animal husbandry and other industries and or sludges available from the biological treatment of public sewage, raw sewage, plant effluents, industrial wastes, etc. can be advantageously utilized as main raw materials and that the ethylene fermentation according to the present invention as such is a microbiological treatment of wastes and effluents as raw material biomass. Furthermore, the method according to the present invention is advantageous over the conventional methods for ethylene production in that the main raw material may be a reproducible biomass which will never be depleted, the production of ethylene is accomplished under comparatively low or mild temperature and pressure conditions because of its being a microbiological process, and the byproduct gas contained in the product biogas is mostly carbon dioxide gas so that the purification of ethylene is easier and the purity of product ethylene is high. Recently, it has been attempted to carry out an alcohol fermentation using a reproducible biomass and a microorganism and, then, convert the alcohol chemically into ethylene. However, the method according to this invention is a one step process, thus enabling one to produce ethylene in a single fermentation step.
