# Apparatus and method for conducting simultaneous solid phase tests for multiple mobile components in fluids.

## Abstract
Apparatus and method are provided for performing multi ple, simultaneous solid phase tests for mobile components in liquids, especially in vitro diagnostic tests. A solid phase de vice is used comprising a receptacle and a insert. The recepta cle has one or more fixed components immobilized on its inner surface. The insert has one or more fixed components differ ent from those immobilized on the receptacle immobilized on its surface which is in contact with a fluid sample when insert ed in the receptacle. The test is performed by placing a fluid sample, having two or more mobile components reactive with the fixed components, into the receptacle and in contact with the insert for a period of time and measuring the changes which are a function of the concentrations of the mobile com ponents.
