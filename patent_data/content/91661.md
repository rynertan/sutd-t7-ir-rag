# Liquid crystal optical modulation element.

## Abstract
A liquid crystal optical modulation element is disclosed. The modulation element comprises two transparent subs trates 51, 52 positioned so as to face each other a transparent electrode 61, 62 provided on the facing surface of the transparent substrates 51, 52 a transparent insulat ing orientation control layer 91, 71 92, 72 provided on each of the facing surfaces of the transparent electrodes 61, 62 , having insulating properties and orientating the liquid crystal 11 molecules in the proximity thereof in a preferential direction substantially parallel to the surfaces of the subs trates 51, 52 a liquid crystal 11 layer exhibiting ferroelec tricity, sandwiched between the insulating orientation con trol layers 91, 71 92, 72 and means 41, 42 for polarizing light passing through said liquid crystal 11 layer. The liquid crystal optical modulation element of the present invention is produced by the steps of coating transparent electrodes 61, 62 onto transparent substrates 51, 52 coating polyimide films 91, 92 so as to cover the transparent electrodes 61, 62 rubbing the polyimide coating films 91, 92 positioning the transparent substrates 51, 52 parallel to each other so that the rubbed polyimide coating films 91, 92 face each other so that a liquid crystal cell is thereby assembled introducing a liquid crystal 11 exhibiting ferroelectricity into the cell thus formed and sealing the cell and providing polarizers 41, 42 on the external surfaces of the substrates 51, 52 .
