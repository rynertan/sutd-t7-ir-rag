# A PROCESS FOR CONVERTING OLEFINS TO DISTILLATE AND OR LUBE OIL PRODUCTS

## Abstract
A process for converting olefins to distillate and or lube oil products comprises contacting under conversion condi tions an olefin with a crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite having a silica to alumina mole ratio of at least 12 and a constraint index within the range of 1 to 12 in the presence of a reactive aromatic hydrocarbon said olefin and said reactive aromatic hydrocarbon being present in a molar ratio of 10 1 to 1 1.
