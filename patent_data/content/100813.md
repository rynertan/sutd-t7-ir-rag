# Multielectrode probe and circuitry.

## Abstract
A system, method and probe for monitoring the corro sion rate of different metals in identical corrosive fluids and under identical conditions, such metals being employed as electrodes other than reference electrodes in a probe having also a reference electrode. The preferred probe comprises a probe body holding at least four electrodes, where one is placed in the center and the others around it in a circle. The center electrode is preferably used as a permanent reference electrode. Each electrode on the circle can then be connected in turn to a channel on a multistation PAIR meter as test and auxiliary electrodes, whereby the corrosion rate on each of them can be monitored in turn. This arrangement greatly enhances the utility of the multistation PAIR meter and with only two entry ports in a system, all channels can serve to answer specific questions on specific electrodes or metals. The novel probe can also be used with a one channel PAIR meter employed with a multistation manual switch. In an alternative electrode arrangement, the center electrode is used as a permanent auxiliary electrode while the system itself is used as a reference electrode and a plurality of test electrodes are employed.
