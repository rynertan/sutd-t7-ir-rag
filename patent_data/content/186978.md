## Description
APPARATUS FOR WRAPPING PRODUCTS This invention relates to apparatus for wrapping products and is especially but not exclusively for wrapping meat products in tubular stocking mesh or netting for sale presentation and cooking purposes. It is well known to wrap meat products in tubular stocking mesh or netting. This, in general, is usually done by aligning tubular stocking mesh or netting with a fixed diameter or other crosssectional area hole in a plate or tunnel and forcing the meat product through the hole into the tubular stocking mesh or netting which is peripherally stretchable. This is often time consuming and unsatisfactory, the meat product requiring often to be subjected to substantial physical or mechanical force to achieve its passage through the hole into the tubular stocking mesh or netting. The result is often unsatisfactory appearance of the net enclosed meat product with sometimes damage to the meat product. It is an object of the present invention to obviate or mitigate the aforesaid drawbacks of existing wrapping apparatus. While reference is made to meat products which includes, inter alia, lambs legs, hams, pigmeat, beef, fowl and sausages continental style this expression is to be construed herein and in the claims as including products other than edible products. According to the present invention there is provided apparatus for wrapping meat products in tubular stocking mesh or netting and comprising a peripherally self adjusting tunnel over one end of which is adapted to be fitted the tubular stocking mesh or netting while the meat product is fed along the tunnel from the other end into the tubular stocking mesh or netting. With this apparatus, the tunnel cross sectional area automatically adjusts to the cross sectional area of the meat product while simultaneously peripherally adjusting the tubular stocking mesh or netting which is stripped off the tunnel by the meat product leaving the latter and being forced into the tubular stocking mesh or netting. It has been found that the tubular stocking mesh or netting is uniformally stretched peripherally and axially of the meat product thus providing a visually attractive packaging around the meat product. Preferably the tunnel is frusto conical in shape and is axially split or slit to permit the peripheral adjustment. Preferably the tunnel is cut away at the meat product entrance end to facilitate feeding of the meat product into the tunnel. Preferably, the tunnel is mounted on a stand and is inclined downwardly from the meat product entrance end to the meat product exit end. In a simple version the tunnel at each end of the axial slit has a handle whereby the user can draw the handles together to compress the tunnel peripherally to assist feeding on the tubular stocking mesh or netting, if necessary. A suitable linkage may be connected to these handles or directly to the tunnel wall to effect this peripheral compression with such linkage being foot pedal operated. A peripherally expandible spring arrangement may be wrapped around the tunnel to determine its minimum cross sectional area. Such spring arrangement may be adjustable. The meat product is preferably pushed through the tunnel but a mechanical arrangement may be provided for such purpose. Other modifications may be made to the apparatus provided the latter incorporates what is considered to be essential thereto namely the peripherally self adjusting delivery tunnel. Embodiments of the present invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a side elevation of a preferred product wrapping apparatus according to the present invention Fig. 2 is a plan view of the delivery tunnel through which the product is passed into a peripherally expanded wrapping nett Fig. 3 is an end view of the delivery tunnel viewed from the outlet end Fig. 4 is a detail view of a support member at the upper end of a stand for supporting the delivery tunnel in any one of three alternative mounting positions Fig. 5 is a front view of the delivery tunnel support member and Figs. 6, 6A and 6B are respectively a perspective view and detail views of an alternative embodiment of product wrapping apparatus. Referring to Figs. 1 to 5, the product wrapping apparatus comprises a peripherally self adjusting tunnel 10 mounted on a stand 11. The tunnel 10 is formed of a single sheet of stainless steel wrapped into an overlapping config ration for part of its length as can clearly be seen in Figs. 1 and 2 at locations 12. The tunnel 10 is of frusto conical configuration and, when mounted on the stand 11 is disposed at an acute angle to the horizontal see Fig. 4 with its narrower end lowermost. The tunnel 10 at its widest and upper end is open at the top as indicated at 13. The tunnel 10 thus has an open topped upper chute like end 14 and a lower circular end 15 of decreasing and adjustable cross section. Each Each overlapping portion 12 has secured to it, for example by welding, adjacent its outer edge a securing peg 16 and the upper overlapping portion 12 has secured to it, also for example by welding, adjacent its inner edge, i.e. centrally of the tunnel 10, a U connector 17 to which is secured by a terminal 18 a flexible element 19, for example a nylon coated steel plated cable, which terminates in a foot stirrup 20. The stand 11 comprises two pairs of tubular legs 21 splayed apart both fore and aft and transversely, the legs 21 being welded to flat plate like feet 22 and being joined fore and aft and transversely by angle irons 23 secured to the legs 21 by welding. The legs 21 at their top are welded to a tunnel support member 24 which has three support faces 24A, 24B, 24C for mounting the tunnel 10 and two end faces 24D and 24E to which the legs 21 are welded. Support face 24B is substantially horizontal while support face 24A subtends an angle of 67.50 with end face 24D and support face 24C subtends an angle of 900 with end face 24E, that is support face 24C is steeper than support face 24A. These angles are only examples and may be varied. The tunnel 10 is secured to a selected support face 24A, 24B or 24C by a connector 25 welded to the underside of the tunnel 10 and constituted by a square tube 25A disposed centrally of and extending along the chute like end 14, a short square tube 25B at the free end of the latter and cut away at an angle at each end with a bolt hole 26 at each end, and a long rectangular tube 25C at its other end, which tube 25C is also cut away at an angle at each end with a bolt hole 27 at each end by means of which the tunnel 10 is secured by nut and bolts 28 to the selected support face 24A, 24B or 24C. A handle 29 for carrying the tunnel, when removed from the stand 11 is welded to the rectangular tube 25C at its ends and extends over the top of the tunnel 10. Alternatively and preferably, in larger sized versions of the apparatus, the tunnel 10 is spot welded to the stand 11 rather than being bolted thereto. With smaller sized versions the tunnel 10 may be bolted to a table not shown using the bolt holes 26 at its widest end. In use, an operator reduces the cross sectional area of the tapering circular cross sectional end 15 of the peripherally resilient tunnel 10 by inserting his foot in the stirrup 20 and pressing downwards. This, it will be manifest causes the overlapping portions 12 to slide relative to one another to effect the aforesaid reduction. With the tunnel 10 in this condition a supply of tubular stocking mesh 30 is fitted onto the tunnel 10, being secured in position at one end on the pegs 16 with its other end left free and extending beyond the lower end of the tunnel 10. The operator then releases the stirrup 20 which causes the end 15 of the tunnel 10 to expand which, in turn, circumferentially stretches the tubular stocking mesh 30.The operator then locates a meat joint, turkey or othor product to be packaged on the chute like end 14 of the tunnel 10 and pushes it through the tunnel 10, which, as usually will be necessary, automatically peripherally expands which causes further expansion of the tubular stocking mesh 30.The meat joint enters the free end of the latter and as the meat joint emerges from the tunnel it pulls off a length of the tubular stocking mesh 30 and stretches same around the meat product in a uniform peripheral and axial pattern to provide a mesh wrapped meat joint of good appearance ready for presentation for sale purposes and cooking. The mesh with the wrapped meat joint is cut from the supply on the tunnel 10 and the latter is ready for wrapping the next product. It will be manifest that any kind of product, not necessarily a food product can be wrapped by this apparatus. If the products to be wrapped are food products then the tunnel 10 must be formed of a material which will not taint or otherwise render the product unacceptable to the eventual consumer. It may, for example, instead of being formed of stainless steel, be formed of an inert plastics material. The wrapping material need not be mesh provided it is tubular and peripherally expandible. Again an inert plastics tubular material might be used or even bags. The tunnel 10 can be formed in different cross sectional sizes and lengths. Referring now to Fig. 6 of the drawings, the wrapping apparatus again comprises a peripherally self adjusting tunnel 40 mounted on a stand 41. The stand 41 may be fixed, or collapsible as shown. The tunnel 40 is inclined at an acute angle to the horizontal. This angle may be fixed, or adjustable as indicated at 42. The tunnel 40 is of frusto conical configuration. It may be of circular cross section as shown or of any other cross sectional shape. Its wider end is uppermost. The tunnel 40 has part of its upper surface cut away at 43 at its upper end to present a receiving surface 44 for a meat product 45 and also to facilitate entry of the latter into the tunnel 40. The tunnel 40 is axially slit as indicated at 46 from its cut away 43 to its lower end. The edges of the slit 46 preferably are slightly offset so that one edge can slide below the other to allow peripheral compression of the tunnel 40 to allow stretchable tubular stocking mesh or netting 47 to be engaged or threaded around the lower end of the tunnel 40. For this purpose, a handle 48 is secured to the tunnel wall at each side of the axial slit 46. A user gripping these handles 48 can push them together thus peripherally compressing the tunnel 40 in the region of the axial slit 46. With tubular stocking mesh or netting 47 fitted onto the tunnel 40, the meat product 45 is laid on surface 44 and is pushed down into the tunnel which, as will usually be necessary, automatically peripherally expands and causes the netting 47 to peripherally stretch. The meat product 45 enters the netting 47 and as it advances therein pulls the netting of the tunnel 40 into a uniform peripheral and axial pattern to provide a net wrapped meat product of good appearance ready for cooking and presentation.
