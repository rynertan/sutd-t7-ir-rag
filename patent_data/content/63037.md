## Description
ADHESIVE COMPOSITION The present invention related to an adhesive composition. More particularly, it relates to an cyano acrylate compound containing adhesive composition which has an enhanced initial adhesion strength. A Cyanoacrylate esters are extremely polymerizable, and they are rapidly cured by the moisture at the surface of a solid material or in the atmosphere without the use of any catalyst or heating. Because of this property, cyanoacrylate esters are used as instantaneous adhesive agents for various materials such as rubbers, plastics, metals and glass. However, even instantaneous adhesive agents often have an inferior initial adhesive strength on the adhesion of some materials such as wood, chrome or nickel plated surfaces, polyesters e.g. FRP and phenol resins and are not suitable for the quick adhesion of such materials. We have now found that the incorporation of certain specific substances into adhesive compositions comprising o cyanoacrylate esters can enhance the initial adhesion strength without deterioration of the advantageous characteristic properties inherent in the compositions such as good storage stability and high bonding strength. According to the present invention, there is provided an adhesive composition which comprises A anct cyanoacrylate ester, B an aliphatic polyol or a derivative thereof or a polyether or a derivative thereof and C an aromatic polyol. The i cyanoacrylate ester used as component A has the formula EMI2.1 wherein R is an ester residue, particularly a substituted or unsubstituted, saturated or unsaturated, cyclic or noncyclic hydrocarbon group such as substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, more specifically alkyl e.g. methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl, n butyl, isobutyl, sec butyl, pentyl, hexyl, octyl, ethylhexyl, dodecyl , alkocyalkyl e.g. methoxyethyl, ethoxy ethyl , haloalkyl e.g. chloroethyl, trifluorethyl , phenylalkyl e.g. benzyl , etc., substituted or unsubstituted alkenyl e.g. allyl , substituted or ubsubstituted alkynyl e.g.propargyl , substituted or ubsubstituted aryl e.g. phenyl, tolyl or substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl e.g. cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl . Alsot R may be a substituted or unsubstitued, saturated or unsaturated heterocyclic group such as tetrahydrofurfuryl.

Specific examples are catechol, pyrogallol, l,2,4 benzenetriol, etc. While various combinations of specific substances of the components A , B and C are possible, particularly preferred is the combination of the a cyanoacrylate ester I as the component A , a polyalkyl ether compound of the formula EMI6.2 wherein X1 is a hydrogen atom or a methyl group, X2 is a hydrogen atom, a methyl group or a cyano group, X3 is a hydrogen atom, R or OCR in which R and R are each a hydrocarbon group not containing any anion polymerizable group but when X2 is a cyano group, X3 is not a hydrogen atom, t and m are each zero or a positive integer but t m is not zero and n is a positive integer as the component B and pyrogallol as the component C . A typical example of the anion polymerizable group is an ethylenically unsaturated bond.

In the adhesive composition of the invention, the a cyanoacrylate ester as the component A is usually contained in an amount of not less than 50 by weight, preferably of not less than 80 by weight, based on the total weight of the adhesive composition. However, this is not limitative.The proportions of the components B and C to the component A may be appropriately selected taking into consider ation the adhesive property of the resulting composition.In general, the amount of component B may be from 0.05 to 20 by weight based on the weight of component A , and the amount of component C may be from 0.0001 to 0.58 by weiaht on the same basis as above. ben these amounts are beloar the lower limits, little improvement is achieved. When these amounts are higher than the higher limits, the curing rate and the adhesion strength of the component CA deteriorate. The adhesive composition of the invention may be used for the bonding of various materials. It is particularly.notable that such adhesive compositions produce a remarkable initial adhesion strength for various materials, especially somewhat acidic materials such as wood chrome or nickelplated surfaces, polyesters and phenol resins.

2, the adhesive composition incorporated with the polyalkyl ether compound IV only is insufficient in initial adhesion strength and that incorporated with pyrogallol only is unsatisfactory in adhesion strength, while the adhesive composition incorporated with the polyalkyl ether compound IV and pyrogallol produces a sufficient initial adhesion strength retaining the inherent or enhanced adhesion strength. Thus, the combined use of the polyalkyl ether compound IV and pyrogallol shows a synergistic effect.
