## Description
NOVEL INTERMEDIATE IN THE PREPARATION OF CYCLOPROPYLCARBOXYLATE ESTERS AND PROCESS FOR ITS MANUFACTURE The invention relates to a compound which is a useful intermediate in the preparation of cyclopropylcarboxylate esters. The invention also relates to a process for the preparation of the compound. The cyclopropylcarboxylate esters are insecticidallyactive compounds known as pyrethroids and as they combine exceptionally good insecticidal properties with a very low mammalian toxicity, they are of considerable interest to the agrochemical industry and much effort has been expended in finding economic routes to them and to their principal intermediates. The general formula of one class of these pyrethroid compounds may be represented as follows EMI1.1 where each asterisk denotes an asymmetric carbon atom eachX is a halogen atom and R is a member of a group of radicals known to impart insecticidal activity to the molecule, e.g. 3 phenoxybenzyl or alpha cyano 5 phenoxybenzyl. It is known that the stereo isomeric form of the acid portion of the ester of formula I should be in the lR, cis form for maximum insecticidal activity, i.e. the absolute configuration at carbon atom 1 is R and the two hydrogen atoms on carbon atoms 1 and 3 are in a cis relationship. This nomenclature is known as the Elliott nomenclature and is defined in M. Elliott, A.W. Farnham, N.y. James, P.H. Needham and D.A. Pullman, Nature, 1974, 248, 710. It follows, therefore, that if these stereo isomeric esters of formula I are to be prepared, either a stereospecific chemical route is required or the desired stereoisomer must be obtained from a racemic form by physical separation techniques. The latter are expensive and laborious and not readily employed on an industrial scale.The Applicant has found a stereospecific route which uses as starting material the naturally occurring substance 3 carene whose formula is as follows EMI2.1 This compound is an inexpensive readily available natural terpene and in our copending application UK 52466 77 K.332 is disclosed a route to the lR, cis acid portion of the pyrethroid ester of formula I starting from 3carene and proceeding via the novel cyclopropane compound according to the invention. The present invention provides 3 hydroxymethyl 2,2dimethylcyclopropanecarbaldehyde dimethyl acetal whose formula is EMI2.2 Prefarably the compound of formula III is in the same stereoisomeric form as that of the cyclopropane ring of 3 carene because this form leads to compounds of general formula I R X in the lR, cis form such compounds generate optimum levels of insecticidal activity in the pyrethroid end product. ihe compound III or its preferred stereoisomeric form may be prepared by methods known per se, for example by hydrolysis of a corresponding ester, see Methoden derOrganischen Chemie Rouben Weyl , Volume VIII 1952 , 418 423 and 638 639. It has been found that the compound may be conveniently prepared by a method which is characterised in that 3 acetoxymethyl 2, 2 dimethylcyclo propanecarbaldehyde dimethyl acetal of formula EMI3.1 is subjected to hydrolysis under conditions which do not affect the dimethoxymethyl group, for example an alkalinereacting medium, e.g. aqueous sodium or potassium hydroxide.Preferably compound IV is employed in the same stereoisomeric form as that of the cyclopropane ring of 3carene. As has been indicated above a multi stage process for the preparation of insecticidally active compounds, starting with 3 carene and in which the compound according to the invention is employed as intermediate, is described inUnited Kingdom patent application 5246 77.
