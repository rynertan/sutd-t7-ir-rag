## Description
METHOD OF CONTROLLED, UNIFORM DOPING OF FLOATING ZONE SILICON The present invention relates generally to the making of silicon crystal rods from which silicon wafers are sectioned for use in the fabrication of semiconductor integrated circuits, and more particularly to a method of producing a single crystal rod of silicon with a controlled content of a desired impurity distributed substantially uniformly throughout the silicon single crystal rod. Generally, for the semiconductor integrated circuit industry today, silicon crystals are grown by theCzochralski crystal pulling process. The heated crucible portion of the furnace, which holds molten silicon, is illustrated in Figure 1. Referring to Figure 1, the crucible 10 may be made of a material such as fused silica or quartz . To initiate single crystal growth, a very pure seed crystal 11 is dipped into the molten silicon 12 contained in the crucible 10 and thereafter pulled from the molten silicon 12 at a controlled rate as denoted by the arrows 14, while the melt is cooled at a controlled rate. As the crystal 11 moves upward it brings along with it i.e. grows a crystalline rod 16 of solid silicon.The end 18 of the rod 16 closest to the pure crystal 11 is referred to as the seed end. The other end 20 closest to the silicon melt 12 is referred to as the tang end. And, of course the middle section 22 of the rod 16 is referred to as the middle. Generally, as a result of the dissolution of the crucible 10 during the Czochralski process, certain impurities may be incorporated into the silicon melt 12 as denoted by the arrows 24 in Figure 1. In most cases, the majority impurity in the silicon melt 12 is oxygen rendered from the fused silica of the crucible 10. Varying amounts of oxygen impurities are thus incorporated into the crystal rod 16 during the crystal pulling formation thereof. As shown from the graph of Figure 2, the axial and radial distribution of oxygen concentration in the crystal rod 16 is very nonuniform. The region within the dashed lines 30 of the graph of Figure 2 is typical of the oxygen distribution along the length of the crystal rod 16.The curvesA, B, C, are representative of typical oxygen distribution across the diameter of the crystal rod atthe seed, middle, and tang ends of the rod 16, respectively. Eor example, at the seed end the oxygen distribution may range from 30 to 50 parts per million and at the tang end the range is reduced to from 10 to 20 parts per million. In addition, as illustrated by the graph of Figure 2, there is also a large axial oxygen distribution nonuniformity. Originally, it was thought that this unintentional oxygen doping of silicon in the crystalline rod 16 during crystal growth was detrimental to the application of the grown silicon to the semiconductor industry.However, it was later identified that the oxygen doped silicon produced by the Czochralski process yielded certain characteristics particularly advantageous for use in semicondutor integrated circuit fabrication. More specifically, the oxygen present in the grown silicon rod is beneficial in avoiding warpage of a silicon wafer sectioned therefrom during the multiple heat cycles of the integrated circuit fabrication process, and in providing an nintrinsic gettering mechanism for lifetime killing of metallic impurities which may be present in such silicon wafers, as a result of contamination during growth or are introduced during subsequent integrated circuit processing steps. Intrinsic gettering is a thermal processing step in which a silicon wafer taken from the crystal rod 16 is exposed to a high temperature anneal in an inert atmosphere during the integrated circuit fabrication process. A cross sectional view of a typical silicon wafer is shown in Figure 3. During this anneal process step, a region 34, called a denuded zone, relatively free of crystalline defects, forms near the surface of the wafer while crystalline imperfections associated with the silicon oxide precipitates form in the bulk region 36 of the silicon substrate or wafer. These crystalline imperfections act as self gettering sites and are believed to be an important factor in maintaining high carrier lifetimes throughout a large scale integrated circuit fabrication process. Unfortunately, the oxygen doped silicon yielded by the Czochralski process also has its disadvantages especially in its application to current very large scale integrated VLSI circuit fabrication. First, the silicon produced is not very pure usually containing on the order of 1014 10l5 cm 3 boron and 10161Ol7 cm 3 carbon impurities. In addition, the Czochralski silcon growth method neither provides for uniform oxygen distribution nor permits easy control of oxygen content of the silicon grown boules see Figure 2, for example . In its application to current VLSI semiconductor processing, the nonuniform oxygen concentrations in the grown silicon boules may give rise to relatively large numbers of microdefects in the denuded zone of the silicon wafers sliced therefrom.Such high densities of deleterious defects in this active device region are not compatible with large scale, high speed integrated circuits which generally require nearly defect free silicon surfaces in which uniform oxygen contents not greater than 10 to 20 parts per million may be required. Another well known technique for preparing large diameter silicon crystals is the float zone process which is capable of producing very pure, low defect density silicon. The resulting silicon is used primarily for semiconductor devices requiring excellent bulk properties and high minority carrier lifetimes, such as power devices, for example. In the float zone process, a polycrystalline silicon rod is passed through a heating zone which melts the portion of the silicon rod being heated which upon cooling becomes of.a single crystalline structure.Owing to the way in which the float zone process is conventionally carried out, the resulting single crystal silicon boule contains substantially no oxygen typically 0.1 ppma and therefore, is not used for integrated circuit fabrication since the wafers taken therefrom exhibit a high degree of warpage after multiple fabrication heatcycles and in addition, exhibit no intrinsic gettering mechanism due to the lack of oxygen therein. To alleviate these drawbacksr oxygen doping of high purity float zone polycrystalline silicon has been tried in the past by, for example, float zoning in an oxygen ambient, but these attempts have been unsuccessful due to melt instabilities associated with the formation of an oxide scum on the molten silicon heating zone surface, which results in a lack of single crystalline growth. In view of the above, there appears to be presented somewhat of a dilemma. The Czochralski process provides the unintentional oxygen doping of the silicon crystals which allow for their use in integrated circuit fabrication due to the aforementioned advantages of the oxygen doping therein. However the inability to control the absolute amounts and the uniformity of the oxygen concentrations throughout the silicon crystal grown by theCzochralski process results in various disadvantages. On the other hand, the float zone process for producing silicon crystals provides essentially no oxygen thus reducing the application thereof in the semiconductor area to only devices which require certain bulk property characteristics.To extend the application of the silicon crystal produced from the float zone process to a more widespread use in integrated circuit fabrication, it is desirable to incorporate oxygen or some other advantageous impurity deep into the polycrystalline structure as part of the crystal growth process in some controlled amount and uniform concentration levels within an amenable range.However, heretofore attempts at introducing oxygen into the silicon crystal formed by the high purity float zone process by conventional doping have been generally unsuccessful. It is the principal object of the invention to provide a single crystal with polyatomic impurities. The invention resides broadly in a method of producing a single crystal rod of silicon with a controlled content of a desired impurity distributed substantially uniformly throughout said silicon crystal rod, said method including the steps of diffusing a polyatomic gaseous element as a desired impurity into the bulk of a polycrystalline rod of silicon, characterized by converting said diffused polycrystalline silicon rod into a single crystal rod of silicon by a float zoning process. More specifically, the step of diffusing includes the steps of doping the polycrystalline silicon rod with the desired impurity by diffusing the atoms of the polyatomic gaseous element along the grain boundary surfaces of the small crystallites in a spatially heterogeneous fashion within the polycrystalline silicon rod and controlling the concentration of the desired impurity dopant in the polycrystalline silicon rod by performing the diffusion of the gaseous element for a predetermined time at a predetermined temperature. In one embodiment, the polycrystalline silicon rod is placed into a diffusion furnace set at a predetermined temperature and thereafter, a controlled flow of the polyatomic gaseous element is established across the polycrystalline silicon rod for a predetermined time duration. Accordingly, the polycrystalline silicon rod may be diffused in a substantially wet or dry oxygen environment. In some cases, the polycrystalline silicon rod may be diffused in a substantially nitrogen environment. The step of converting may be performed in either a substantially inert gas or vacuum environment. Preferred embodiments are described hereafter for exemplary purposes only in accordance with the following drawings Figure 1 is an illustration of the conventionalCzochralski process for growing silicon crystals in an industrial crystal pulling crucible furnace Figure 2 is a graph exemplifying the axial and radial distribution of oxygen concentration in a crystal rod grown by the Czochralski process Figure 3 is a cross sectional view of a typical silicon wafer illustrating a denuded zone relatively free of crystalline defects formed near the top surface thereof Figures 4 and 5 are illustrations which relate to a two step process including the control diffusion of a polyatomic gaseous element into a polycrystalline silicon rod and, the subsequent conversion of the diffused rod into a single crystal of silicon by a float zone method of crystal growth and Figure 6 is a graph which compares the oxygen concentrations of the single silicon crystal boules grown by the process described in connection with the illustrations of Figures 4 and 5 with the oxygen concentration of a typical silicon boule grown by the Czochralski method. The method of producing a single crystal rod of silicon with a controlled content of a desired impurity distributed substantially uniformly throughout the silicon crystal rod is exhibited in the illustrations of Figures 4 and 5 which relate to a two step process including the controlled diffusion of a polyatomic gaseous element like oxygen or nitrogen, for example, into a polycrystalline silicon rod Figure 4 and, the subsequent conversion of the diffused rod into a single crystal of silicon by a float zone method of crystal growth Figure 5 . In contrast to the conventional Czochralski growth method, the present method results in a reproducible technique for the fabrication of silicon crystals containing a controlled amount of the desired impurity which is distributed substantially uniformly throughout the crystal.For example if oxygen is desired, the process may be controlled to diffuse up to 20 parts per million of oxygen substantially uniformly throughout the crystal. More specifically, in the first step of the preferred process, a polycrystalline rod 40 is diffused in a controlled environment of a polyatomic gaseous element, like oxygen, for example. Because of the polycrystalline nature of the rod 40, the oxygen doping concentration is governed by the phenomenon of enhanced diffusion of oxygen atoms along the grain boundary surfaces of the small crystallites in the rod 40. This process may be carried out by placing the polycrystalline silicon rod 40 in a diffusion furnace at a temperature preferably set at 1200 to 13000C in which a flow of dry or wet oxygen is established. This thermal diffusion process distributes the oxygen in a spatially hetrogeneous fashion throughout the bulk of the silicon rod 40.In a preferred experiment, a polycrystalline rod on the order of 1 to 2 inches in diameter was diffused in a diffusion furnace with a flow 3 of dry oxygen at approximately 600 cm per minute at a temperature along the order of 12000C for a time duration of 336 hours. It is understood however that the magnitude of the oxygen content in the polycrystalline silicon rod is determined by the environmental temperature and duration of time at which the diffusion is carried out. In the second step of the preferred process as depicted in Figure 5, the polycrystalline silicon rod 40 which contains a level of oxygen as determined by the diffusion time and temperature of the first step, described hereabove, may be placed in a conventional float zoning apparatus in an inert gas or vacuum ambient and converted by the float zoning procedures thereof into an oxygen doped single crystal of silicon as shown at 42. This process is performed by moving the oxygen diffused polycrystalline silicon rod 40 through heating elements 44, such as RF coils, for example, which render a molten silicon zone 46 in the polysilicon rod 40. As the silicon rod passes through the heating zone comprising the coils 44, it solidifies into a single crystal silicon rod at 42.The final oxygen concentration of the float zoned crystal at 42 is dependent primarily on the environmental diffusion parameters as described in connection with process step 1. The crux of the inventive process is that in this crucible free, float zoning process owing to its near unity segregation coefficient, the oxygen will be distributed substantially uniformly both radially and axially throughout the silicon crystal as opposed to the silicon crystals grown by the conventional Czochralski technique which exhibits spatially nonuniform oxygen distributions.In addition, the high background purity characteristic of silicon produced by the conventional float zoning process will be maintained substantially in the oxygen doped, float zoned silicon crystal formed since any deleterious heavy metal contamination resulting from the diffusion step 1 is removed during the float zoning step of the process. The graph of Figure 6 exhibits various experimental results in fabricating single silicon crystal boules with controlled, uniform oxygen concentrations.Curve portions 50, 52 and 54 depict the axial variations of the oxygen concentration of three oxygen doped silicon crystals fabricated by the aforementioned float zone procedure compared to the oxygen distribution of a typical silicon boule grown by the Czochralski method as shown by the curve region 56. Eor the curve region 52, a 30 millimeter diameter polycrystalline rod Dow Corning 111 0749 6 was diffusion annealed under a flow of dry ultra high purity oxygen in a 3 inch diameter diffusion furnace for 336 hours at 12000C.The oxygen doped rod was then placed in a Westech Model 145 float zone refiner and float zoned in the 111 orientation under an inert ultra high purity argon ambient at a pressure of 1000 Torr using a zoning rate of 2 millimeters minute to produce a 30 millimeter diameter 111 oriented silicon crystal see Figure 5 . The oxygen concentrations in the resulting silicon crystal were determined by Fourier transform infrared spectrometry using Digilab FTS 14 IR spectrometer. The oxygen level at the crystal seed end seeFigure 5 at 48 was about 1 x 1017 cm 3 2 ppma and 2 x 1017 cm 3 4 ppma at the tail end. The curve region 50 corresponds to a 25 millimeter diameter polycrystalline silicon rod Topsil . This rod was diffusion annealed under the same conditions as used for curve region 52. After float zoning in the 100 orientation under an inert argon ambient, the polysilicon rod yielded a 30 millimeter diameter silicon crystal having an oxygen concentration of 16 ppma 8 x 3 1017 cm 3 at the seed end and a concentration of 18 ppma 9 x 1017 cm 3 at the tang end. The curve 54 corresponds to a polycrystalline silicon rod of similar dimensions as that of the other two rods associated with curves 50 and 52 and was diffusionannealed under similar conditions. The diametric spread of oxygen concentration for this experimental example was centered about a level of approximately 32 ppma with very little axial change from the seed end to the tang end. These representative experiments demonstrate that by utilizing the preferred procedure as described hereabove, float zoned silicon crystals can be uniformly doped with a desired impurity like oxygen or nitrogen and the like, at levels up to approximately 32 ppma and that the axial uniformity of the oxygen distribution realized by this procedure represents a significant improvement over the distribution uniformities typical of conventionalCzochralski grown silicon boules. Polycrystalline silicon rods having varying amounts of residual carbon content were investigated during the experimental process involving the abovedescribed two step method. The specific carbon content of the silicon rods ranged from .26 ppma to approximately 1.5 ppma. While the diffused oxygen content in the silicon rods was observed to vary with a changing residual carbon content, the effect of the carbon content on oxygen incorporation in the silicon crystal was inconclusive. While the method described hereabove used the gaseous element oxygen for diffusion, it is understood that other polyatomic gaseous elements such as nitrogen and the like may a lso be used without deviating from the broad principles of the present inventive method. The preferred method disclosed hereabove is intended for fabricating impurity doped float zoned silicon boules which exhibit uniform concentrations of the desired impurity. This method, when applied to polycrystalline silicon rods, results in the production of high purity float zone silicon crystals with substantially uniform oxygen concentrations of up to 32 ppma which are not currently attainable utilizing the conventional Czochralski silicon boule fabrication methods of the semiconductor industry. The controlled doped silicon material resulting from the preferred process is of special interest in view of its potential as a high quality silicon substrate wafer material for very large scale, high speed integrated circuit applications.
