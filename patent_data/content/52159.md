## Description
This invention relates to an apparatus for automatically loading and unloading boxes intended to contain radiographic plates, and for feeding automatic developing machines. Known are, in the radiographic diagnostics field, machines for automatically developing X ray plates. Such plates are usually contained in suitable metal boxes which, when the plate is to be taken out of them and inserted in the developer, must be opened in a dark room. Obviously, the subsequent placing of a fresh plate into the box also requires the availability of a dark room.Such operations are time consuming, in spite of the fast action required sometimes in carrying outX ray examinations, and notwithstanding the general trend toward increasing autonation of procedures. This invention sets out to provide an apparatus which is capable of carrying out in a fully automated manner the entire radiographic plate developing process, including replacement of the exposed plate with a fresh one inside the plate containing box. Within that general aim, it is possible to arrange that this apparatus for automatically developing radiographic plates is reliable in operation, versatile in use, even in connection with the different size of the plates utilized in diagnostics, as well as simple in design and easy to manufacture, thereby its production is made in all senses advantageous. according to one aspect of this invention, there is provided an apparatus for automatedly developing radiographic plates, characterized in that it comprises a frame defining a dark room compartment, means for transferring into said compartment one container of a plate to be developed, means for opening said container, means for picking up said plate from said container and inserting said plate into a developing machine, and means for picking up from a magazine a fresh plate and inserting said fresh plate into said container. Further details of this invention will be more clearly understood from the following description of a preferred embodiment of this apparatus for the automated development of radiographic plates, with reference to the accompanying drawings, where Figure 1 shows a perspective, partly cut away and diagramatcal, view of this apparatus Figure 2 is a perspective view of the means provided for opening the plate container Figures 3 and 4 are a perspective view of the magazine and a party sectional elevation view of a drawer Figures 5,6 and 7 show in perspective, elevation, and plan views, a modified embodiment and Figure 8 shows a different embodiment of the means for opening the plate container. With reference to the drawing figures, there is generally indicated at 1 an apparatus frame having a substantially parallelepipedal shape and comprising uprights 2 whereto side panels 3 are attached, part of said panels being openable for access to the apparatus member. The frame 1, supported on suitable feet 4, defines a dark room compartment wherein a box like container 5 containing a radiographic plate can be opened. On a front side of the frame 1, there is provided an inlet 6 having a horizontal opening 7 for introducing the container 5 with the plate to be developed into said dark room compartment. The opening 7 is closed by a rubber curtain 8, located on the inside of the inlet 6, said curtain being suitably framed to prevent infiltration of light to the dark room inside. Within the frame 1, there are arranged, adjacent the inlet 6, a multiplicity of horizontal and parallel rollers 9 forming a conveyor deck or surface for the container 5, located at a substantially middle portion of the frame. The rollers 9 are driven rotatively, through a drive chain 10, by a motor member 11. A second motor member 12 is accommodated in the lower portion of the frame 1 for driving, through a drive 13, the remaining movable members of the machine. Above the plane of said rollers 9, there is provided an idle roller 14 in tangential relationship at the bottom with the other along a generatrix under the bias of suitable spring means 15 wherefrom it is suspended. At the end of the conveyor deck comprising the rollers 9, there are provides means for determining or sensing the size of the container 5 introduced into the apparatus, which means are shown more clearly in Figure 2. Said means comprise a square 16 coplanar with the conveyor deck, against one side whereof the container 5 abuts in sliding on the rollers 9. That abutment action causes a small lever arm 17 two be displaced which actuates a first microswitch 18, which in turn controls the actuation of a first pneumatic cylinder 19.The rod 20 of said pneumatic cylinder 19 causes a block 22 to slide on guides 21, a horizontal strip 23 coplanar with the square 16 along the direction of advance of the container 5 being rigid with said block The strip 23 urges the container 5 to contact the second side of the square 16. Thus, a dual set of microswitches 24a,b are actuated, which are aligned along two orthogonal directions of the square 16, and thus determine the size of the container. At that position, after completing its sliding travel on the rollers 9, the container 5 is located at means adapted for opening it, such that the plate can be withdrawn therefrom. Said container opening means comprise a pneumaticsucker 25 mounted on a support or holder 26 which is arranged to slide on guides 27 secured longitudinally between a pair of arms 28a,b which are pivoted with one end to a pivot pin 29.A return spring 30 acts on the holder 26 for the sucker 25 longitudinally to said guides 27. The pivotal movement of the arms 28a,b in a vertical plane about the pivot pin 29 is obtained by means of a vertical rod 31, which is linked with its top or upper end to a U bent portion 32 of the arm 28a. With its lower or bottom end, the rod 31 is linked to a corresponding end of an arm 33 pivoted, at its other end, to a horizontal shaft 34 and engaging centrally a cam 35, which being keyed to a second shaft 36 parallel to the former and rotatively driven by the motor 12, is operative to produce a substantially axial oscillatory reciprocation of the rod 31. Laterally to the arm 28a, there are pivoted a plurality of catches 37 adapted to alternately engage, in accordance with the size of the container 5, a tripping pushbutton 38 provided on the container for the opening thereof. To the shaft 34, there is also pivoted a second arm 39 engaging centrally a second cam 40 mounted on the shaft 36 and being linked with its free end to a second vertical rod 41, which it also reciprocates. Said second rod 41 is operative to adtuate means for picking up the plate from the container 5 and inserting it into a conventional developer, which will not be described herein.That developer, as indicated at 42, is rigidly coupled to the dark room compartment of said frame 1 through a suitable connect ivss q tucture, which structure includes a top hatch 43 for direct access to the developer 42 in emergency situations. Said plate pick up means, as indicated at 44 in the drawings, comprise a yoke member comprising a horizontal cross member 45 mounted between a pair of sectional elements 46a,b which are pivoted to bushings 47 attached to respective uprights 2 of the frame 1, such as to be pivotable in a vertical plane in the direction of advance of the plate on the rollers 9. Rigid with the sectional element 46a is a small arm 48 linked to the top or upper end of said second rod 41 which rotates said yoke. The cross member 45 carries a plurality of suckers 49 effective to grip the plate 44 for transporting said plate to a pair of counterotating rollers 50a,b of the developer 42.. Within the frame 1, there are furtherr accommodated a plurality of drawer containers 51, which being stacked alongside the rollers 9, constitute the magazine containing unexposed plates. To pick up a fresh plate from its related drawer in said magazine, and inserting it into the container 5, there is provided a device comprising a horizontal bar 52 extending crosswise to the rollers 9 and carrying a plurality of suckers 53 adapted for gripping the plate. The bar 52 is made rigid with one end to a block 54 mounted for sliding movement on vertical guides 55, upon actuation of a second air operated cylinder 56..The vertical guides 55 are attached to a frame 57 which is in turn slidable on a pair of horizontal guides 58 which are mounted, through bushings 59, on uirïghts 2 of the frame parallel to the rollers 9. The movement of the frame 57 on the guides 58 is effected by means bf a third air operated or pneumatic cylinder 60, thereby the bar 52 is enabled to move either in the vertical or horizontal direction The drawers 51 have a box lïke configuration and standardized dimensions matching, of course, the largest sizzle plates they are to contain.Each drawer 51 has on opposite sides, externally thereto, grooves 61 adapted for guiding a respective sliding cover 62 which abuts, in its closed condition, against a raised sideboard 63 on the front of the drawer, for light imperviousness. On the top face, the cover 62 of the drawer 51 is provided with a recessed grooved sectional member 64 having a U cross section and extending orthogonally to the direction of insertion of the cover over the drawer. The drawer 51, as filled with unexposed plates, is introduced into the frame 1 through a removable panel 3a located on one side of the inlet 6, and is placed onto a pair of opposite angle members 65a,arranged to lay parallel to the direction of advance of the containers 5. At the same time, the groove of the insert 64 on the cover 62 engages a fixed tab 66 of the frame.The angle members 65a,b carry at the bottom and transversely additional sectional members 67, br means of which they are mounted slidably, in a known manner, between pairs of idlerwheels 68, thereby the drawers 51, once they have been mounted on the angle members 65ambi are slidable in an orthogonal direction to that. of advance of the containers 5. That sliding movement is produced by additional pneumatic cylinders 69 the rods whereof are frigid with the members. The drawers 51 have on their front sides a pair of vertical slots 70 wherein there engage respective througbgoing screws 71 with which i s rigid, on the inside of the drawer, a small horizontal bar 72 adapted for marginally resting on the plates contained in the drawer. At said bar, sn the drawer bottom, there is mounted a metal foil 73 adapted for closing a suitable electric circuit with the bar itself, to monitor the emptying of the drawer. To the front wall of the drawer 51, there is attached a sheet strip 74 to prevent the infiltration of light through the slots 70. The drawers intended for containing plates with a smaller size than the maximum size, are further provided with a vertical diaphragm 75 which borders their useful space. Above the rollers 9, lastly, there are provided means for closing the container 5, which comprise a plurality of wheels 76 mounted on an axle 77 parallel to the rollers. The apparatus described hereinabove operates as follows. The container 5 containing the exposed plate is introduced through the opening 7 of the inlet 6 and advanced on the rollers 9 until it contacts the transverse side of the square 16, to also trip the microswitch 18. Then, the first pneumatic cylinder 19 is actuateS which, through the crossmember 23, brings the container 5 to also contact the longitudinal side of the square 16. Once the container 5 has been blocked, it is opened by the arms 28a,b pivoting, under the action of the rod 31, to bring the sucker 25 to grip the container cover, while at the same time the suitable catch 37 trips the pushbutton 38 and releases the cover. A reverse rotation of the arms 2a,b causes the container to be opened. The second rod 41 then moves up to rotate the cross member 45, until the sucker 49 is brought to grip the plate 44 contained in the container 5. Suitable connections are, of course, provided for applying a vacuum to either this or the other suckers. With the cross member 45 moving successively in the opposite direction, the plate 44 is lifted up and introduced in the nip of the counter rotating rollers 5Oa,b of the developer 42, which develops it in a known manner. Then, a fresh plate is loaded into the container 5, the size whereof has been detected by the dual set of microawitches 24a,b..A related pneumatic cylinder 69 thus opens the drawer 51 which corresponds to that size, and causes the sectional members 67 to slide, whereon he drawer is mounted, on the wheels 68, while the cover 62 remains locked owing to its insert 64 engaging the tab 66.. The picking up of a fresh plate and the introduction thereof into the open container 5 are effected through the suckers 53 mounted on the bar 52, the translation whereof is effected in either the vertical or horizontal directions by pneumatic cylinders 56 and 60. It should be noted that the presence of the bar 72, acting on the edges of the plates, causes a plate to flex while being picked up, thus facilitating its separation from the underlying plates. After a fresh plate has been inserted into the container,the releasing of the sucker25tauses the cover of the container to be dropped. Reverse actuation of the rollers 9 brings the container 5 back toward the inlet 6. The container is tripped closed while still ins the dark room compartment, as it moves past under the wheels 76. The emptying of one of the drawers 51 is monitored by the contact of the bar 72 closing onto the foil73. With the apparatus stopped, it is then possible to withdraw the drawer fron the angle members 55a,b which support it, for loading it with a fresh charge of plates. In practicing the invention, its technical details may be modified to suit individuall requirements.. Thus, for example, the means for detecting the size or dimensions of the containers may be constructed as shown in Pigures 5 7. In the cited figures, there are indicated at 78 the rollers which form the container feeding deck or surface.. Below the rollers 78, there is arranged a bracket 79 hinged for oscillation to thb frame, by means of a pivot pin 80. he oscillation plane of the bracket 79 extends cross wise to the container direction of advance. The operationof the bracket 79 is controlled by a cam 81, mounted radially on a driveshaft 82, which can engage a roller cantilevered from an arm 83 pivoted to a shaft 84 parallel to the shaft 82. The free end of the arm 83 is swivel connected through a tie rod 85 to the end of the bracket 79..At a suitable position on the bracket 79, there are arranged a plurality of switches 86 which are adapted, as the bracket is being raised and lowered, to move to a position overlying the top tangency plane of the rollers 78 from a position underlying said plane. As shown best in Figure 7, the microswitches are arranged such that they are enabled each to detect a size of the oncoming containers after the latter have been abutted against the square 87. Thus, for example, the microswitch 86a is operative to detect the smallest size, whereas the microswitch 86b can be made to detect the largest size. In practice, each microswitch will act on that area of the container which protrudes beyond the periphery of the next smaller one.The microswitches 86 see Figure 6 have actuating toggles of such a size that they can contact the bottoms of the containers through the gaps between adjacent rollers. It should be noted that the positzoning of the containers against the square 87 may be obtained, additionally to the combined action of the feeding rollers and a side pusher, such as the one indicated art 23, also by arranging the rollers 78 suitably inclined on the feeding diirection.. In fact, in this way a transverse motion component is obtained which causes a side displacement of the containers and their abutting against the longitudinal and transverse sides of the square 87. The solution shown in Figures 5 7 has the peculiarity, over the preceding one, of greatly reducing the number of mïcroswitches required. Moreover, a considerable simplification is achieved when the need arises for modifying the positions of the microswitches to suit boxes of a different size from the one initially anticipated. With particular reference to Figure 8, there is shown a different embodiment of the means for opening the container according to this embodiment, the strip 23, which urges the container 5 against the second side of the square 16, is provided with a plurality of small pegs 90, spaced apart from one another, which extend perpendicularly to the strip 23, on the side next to the container 5. At least one of the pegs 90 can be inserted through side holes provided on the side of the container 5 located at the opening pushbutton, thereby it can actuate directly the pushbutton itself. The pegs 90 which are not in alignment with a hole, being carried elastically by the strip 23, are allowed to slide back inside the strip without obstructing its travel movement. It should be added that the strip 23 may be provided with a longitudinal edge 91 which protects the pegs 90 during the phase of introduction and withdrawal of the container 5.. In practicing the invention, the shapes and dimensions may varyraccording to individual requirements.
