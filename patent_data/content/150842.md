The xylylene group may be either one of its ortho , meta and para forms. The halogen may for example be chlorine, bromine or iodine. Particularly preferred one is a compound of the general formula 1 in which R1 means a hydrogen atom and m stands for an integer of 4 12. The compounds of this invention are all novel compounds which have not been described in any literatures as far as the present inventors are aware of. Certain representative examples of the compounds according to this invention will hereinafter be given. For the brevity and simplification of exemplification of compounds, compounds of the general formula 1 in which X is fixed to bromine and R2 denotes polymethylene groups represented by the general formula EMI3.1 m integer of 4 20 will first be mentioned by way of example, which will then be followed by exemplification of compounds of the general formula 1 in which X is fixed also to bromine but R2 denotes a xylylene group. First of all, as compounds in each of whichR2 is a polymethylene group, may for example be mentioned l bromo 4 glycidoxybutane, l bromo 5glycidoxypentane, l bromo 6 glycidoxyhexane, l bromo 8 glycidoxyoctane, l bromo l0 glycidoxydecane, l bromo12 glycidoxydodecane, l bromo 14 glycidoxytetradecane, 1 bromo 16 glycidoxyhexadecane, 1 bromo 18 glycidoxyoctadecane, l bromo 20 glycidoxyeicosane, l bromo 4 i methyl glycidoxybutane, l bromo 5 methyl glycidoxypentane, l bromo 6 B methyl glycidoxyhexane, 1 bromo 8 ss methyl glycidoxyoctane, 1 bromo 10 methyl glycidoxydecane, l bromo l2 methyl glycidoxydodecane, l bromo 14 B methyl glycidoxytetra decane, 1 bromo 16 ss methyl glycidoxyhexadecane, 1 bromo 18 ss methyl glycidoxyoctane and 1 bromo 20 ss methyl glycidoxyeicosane. As compounds in each of which R2 is a xylylene group, may for example be mentioned l bromomethyl 2 glycidoxymethylbenzene, l bromomethyl 3 glycidoxymethylbenzene, l bromomethyl 4 glycidoxymethylbenzene, l bromomethyl 2 p methyl glycidoxy methylbenzene, 1 bromomethyl 3 ss methyl glycidoxymethylbenzene and 1 bromomethyl 4 ss methyl glycidoxymethylbenzene. In the process of this invention which process is adapted to prepare the halogen substituted glycidyl ether compound, the hydroxyl substituted compound which is used as a starting material is either g gcidol or ss methylglycidol, specifically speaking. On the other hand, the dihalogen substituted compound is a straight chain alkane in which both terminal of its molecule have respectively been halogen substituted or a xylene derivative in which each one of the hydrogen atoms of its two methyl groups has respectively been halogen substituted. The xylene may be either one of its ortho , meta and para forms. Each of the halogens may for example be chlorine, bromine or iodine. As a specific method for effecting the reaction in the presence of the strong basic substance in the preparation process of this invention, the reaction may be initiated either by dissolving the strong basic substance in the liquid reaction mixture or by maintaining the strong basic substance in a state suspended in the liquid reaction mixture. Although both methods may be employed in the present invention, it is surprisingly preferred from the viewpoint of reaction efficiency such as suppression of side reactions to initiate the reaction with the strong basic substance maintained in a suspended state. More specifically, as a method for initiating the reaction while maintaining the strong basic substance in a suspended state, a suitable method may be employed.For example, it may be feasible to add at once the hydroxyl substituted compound, dihalogen substituted compound and strong basic substance to an aprotic polar solvent and then to stir the resultant mixture so as to suspend the strong basic substance for the initiation of the reaction to suspend the strong basic substance in the aprotic polar solvent and then add the hydroxylsubstituted compound and dihalogen substituted compound simultaneously to the resultant suspension for the initiation of the reaction or to either dissolve or suspend the hydroxyl substituted compound and dihalogen substituted compound in the aprotic polar solvent and then to suspend the strong basic substance in the resultant solution or suspension for the initiation of the reaction. The reaction solvent useful in the practice of the present invention may be any aprotic polar solvent.As exemplary aprotic polar solvents, may be mentioned acetonitrile, N,N dimethylformamide, N,N dimethylacetamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, sulfolane, tetraglime, dioxane and N methylpyrrolidone. In a reaction system in which the process of this invention is carried out, it is preferred to initiate the reaction with at least part of the strong basic substance being in a suspended state. The amount of water in such a state may generally be about 6 wt. or below as the amount of water in the reaction system.If the amount of water should exceed the abovementioned level, side reactions such as hydrolysis of the dihalogen substituted compound tend to occur more readily, whereby to reduce the yield significantly. In order to carry out the reaction with good efficiency and hence to increase the yield of the intended reaction product, it is hence preferred to control the water content 5 wt. or below in the reaction system. No particular limitation is imposed on the amount of a solvent to be used. It may however range from 5 wt. to 95 wt. or preferably, 10 wt. 90 wt. , both based on the total weight of the reaction mixture inclusive of the solvent. Turning to the strong basic substance useful in the practice of this invention, any strong basic substance may be used so long as it is in a solid form and when dissolved or suspended in water, provides an aqueous solution or suspension of at least pH 10 or preferably pH 11 or higher. As such basic substances, may for example be mentioned alkali metal hydroxides, alkali metal oxides, alkali metal carbonates, alkaline earth metal hydroxides, alkaline earth metal oxides, alkali metal hydrides, alkaline earth metal hydrides, alkali metal amides, and alkali metal alkoxides. Illustrative of the above substances may include sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, rubidium hydroxide and cesium hydroxide as alkali metal hydroxides sodium oxide, potassium oxide, lithium oxide, rubidium oxide and cesium oxide as alkali metal oxides sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, lithium carbonate, rubidium carbonate and cesium carbonate as alkali metal carbonates beryllium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, strontium hydroxide and barium hydroxide as alkaline earth hydroxides beryllium oxide, magnesium oxide, calcium oxide, strontium oxide and barium oxide as alkaline earth metal oxides sodium hydride, potassium hydride and lithium hydride as alkali metal hydrides and beryllium hydride, magnesium hydride and calcium hydride as alkaline earth metal hydrides.The term alkali metal amides as used herein means alkali metal substituted compounds of ammonia, including for example sodium amide, potassium amide and lithium amide. By the term alkali metal alkoxides as used herein is meant compounds obtained by substituting the protons of the hydroxyl groups of alcohols with alkali metals. Illustrative of such alkali metal alkoxides include sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, sodium t butoxide, potassium methoxide, potassium ethoxide and potassium t butoxide. Among the above described various basic substances, for example, alkali metal hydroxides, alkaline earth metal hydroxides, alkali metal oxides, alkaline earth metal oxides and alkali metal carbonates are suitable for the practice of the process of this invention. These strong basic substances are usually provided in their solid forms for the reaction. The reaction is initiated after at least part of such a strong basic substance has been rendered into a state suspended in the liquid reaction mixture. In the practice of this invention, the relative proportions of the raw materials, i.e., the hydroxyl substituted compound, dihalogen substituted compounds and strong basic substance to be used may vary depending on the reactivity between the dihalogensubstituted compound and the hydroxyl substituted compound and the like and hence cannot be determined equally for different situations. However, a side reaction takes place to substitute the two halogen atoms of the dihalogensubstituted compound and the yield is hence decreased if the relative ratio of the hydroxyl substituted compound to the dihalogen substituted compound approaches 1. On the other hand, existence of the dihalogen substituted compound in large excess induces a reaction between the strong basic substance and dihalogen substituted compound, whereby using up the dihalogen substituted compound and thus resulting in a lowered yield. Roughly speaking, the dihalogen substituted compound may be used in an amount within the range of 0.5 30 times or preferably 0.8 15 times in mole the hydroxyl substituted compound. On the other hand, the strong basic substance may generally be used in an amount within the range of 0.3 15 times or preferably 0.5 10 times in mole the hydroxyl substituted compound. The reaction may be carried out using a usual reaction tank. When using a strong basic substance having low solubility, the reaction may be carried out in accordance with the flow reaction method, namely, by packing the strong basic substance in a tower and then causing a liquid mixture of the hydroxyl substituted compound and dihalogen substituted compound to pass through the tower while circulating the liquid mixture.For the maintenance and control of equipment, it is however more convenient to employ a reaction tank. The reaction temperature is dependent on the reactivity between each hydroxyl substituted compound and dihalogen substituted compound to be used.However, the progress of the reaction will be retarded if the reaction temperature is unduly low. If the reaction temperature is excessively high, side reactions such as hydrolysis of the dihalogsn substituted compound will occur and the yield of the intended reaction product will be reduced. Therefore, the reaction is usually carried out within the temperature range of 20 1000C, preferably 10 700C.or more preferably 0 500C. Within these temperature ranges, it is not absolutely necessary to maintain the temperature at the same constant level during the reaction.The reaction may be effeciently caused to proceed by suitably controlling the reaction temperature while precisei observing the progress of the reaction. Similar to the reaction temperature, the reaction time also varies in accordance with each hydroxyl substituted compound and dihalogen substituted compound to be employed. It may be within 30 hours at the longest, and usually within 20 hours. The progress of the reaction can be determined by observing changes in the nature of the reaction system and determining the concentrations of the raw materials and intended reaction product in the liquid reaction mixture by means of gas chromatography or high speed liquid chromatography. After the reaction, the resultant metal halide is filtered off for its separation. The filtrate is then distilled under reduced pressure by a method known per se in the art, thereby obtaining the intended reaction product with high purity. In case the metal halide is dissolved in the liquid reaction mixture or is otherwise allowed to remain in the liquid reaction mixture, after the solvent is distilledofft the metal halide is removed by a solvent extraction procedure using two solvents in combination, which solvents form two layers such as the combination of, for example, hexanewater, benzene water or chloroform water. Upon distillation of the organic layer under reduced pressure, the intended reaction product is obtained with high purity.If the intended reaction product has a high boiling point or is susceptible to decomposition under heat, the intended reaction product can be purified by such a method as, for example, solvent extraction or recrystallizatian. If the reaction solvent has a high degree of miscibility with water like dimethyl sulfoxide and the intended reaction product is highly hydrophobic like a compound containing a long chain polymethylene group, the intended reaction product may be isolated after the reaction, for example, by adding a solvent of aliphatic hydrocarbon such as hexane to the liquid reaction mixture to extract the intended product, adding water to the liquid reaction mixture to separate the intended product as an oil layer, or extracting the intended product with a solvent capable of forming two layers with water, such as benzene, toluene or chloroform. According to the present invention, a wide variety of halogen substituted glycidyl ether compounds can each be prepared through a one step reaction and moreover, at a low cost. In addition, the preparation process of this invention permits preparation of a wide variety of halogen substituted glycidyl ether compounds in the same reaction manner. Therefore, it is possible to prepare a broad variety of halogen substituted glycidyl ether compounds by the same reactor. Hence, the preparation process of this invention has an advantage that it can be suitable used for the preparation of a variety of halogen substituted glycidyl ether compounds in small volumes. Since the halogen substituted glycidyl ether compounds of this invention contain highly reactive halogen atoms in their molecules, they may be reacted, similar to ordinary halogen substituted compounds, with amide compounds, amines, hydroxyl substituted compounds and the like. Since a glycidoxy or B methylglycidoxy group is bonded as a functional group to one terminal of the molecule of each of the halogen substituted glycidyl ether compounds, they can be used as extremely useful intermediates when introducing such functional groups into amide compounds, amines, hydroxylsubstituted compounds and the like. The glycidyl ether compounds of this invention, in each of which a glycidoxy or methylglycidoxy group has been introduced, may be applied in a variety of fields, depending on their backbone structures. Namely, as their specific application fields, they may be used as primary raw materials, auxiliary raw materials or crosslinking agents in adhesives, paints, paper converting and conditioning agents, textileprocessing agents, emulsions, urethane curing agents, pigment dispersants, plastic additives, polymer flocculants, ion exchange resins, absorber resins, chelate resins, optical lens, photosensitive resins, soft contact lens, hygroscopic resins, binders for magnetic materials, binders for composite materials, polymer catalysts, clinical reagents, bio compatible materials, enzyme immobilizing base materials, etc. The invention will next be described further in the following Examples.
