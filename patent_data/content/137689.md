## Description
GRF ANALOGS The present invention relates to peptides having influence on the function of the pituitary gland in mammals. In particular, the present invention is directed to peptides which promote the release of growth hormone by the pituitary gland and which are particularly useful with respect to particular species. In 1982, a hypothalamic releasing factor for pituitary growth hormone or somatotropin was isolated from a human islet cell tumor, purified, characterized and synthesized. When tested, it was found to promote the release of growth hormone GH by the pituitary.This peptide has the sequence H Tyr Ala Asp Ala Ile Phe Thr Asn Ser Tyr Arg Lys Val Leu Gly Gln Leu Ser Ala Arg Lys Leu Leu Gln Asp Ile Met Ser Arg Gln Gln Gly Glu Ser Asn Gln Glu Arg Gly Ala Arg Ala Arg Leu NH2. Human hypothalamic growth hormone releasing factor hGRF has now been found to have the same structure, Bohlen et. al. Biochem. and Biophs. Res.Comm., 114, 3, pp. 930 936 1983 . Now 44 residue polypeptides have been isolated from purified extracts of porcine, bovine, caprine and ovine hypothalami and characterized. They were each found to have a difference of a few amino acid residues from the formula of hGRF as set forth hereinafter. In terms of the composition of hGRF, Porcine 34GRF pGRF may be expressed as the analog Arg Gln38,Val42 hGRF 1 44 NH2 which means it has the formula H Tyr Ala Asp Al a Ile Phe Thr Asn Ser Tyr Arg Lys ValLeuGly Gln Leu Ser Ala Arg Lys Leu Leu Gln Asp Ile Met Ser Arg Gln Gln Gly Glu Arg Asn Gln Glu GlnGly Ala Arg Val Arg Leu NH2. It is hereinafter referred to as pGRF or porcine somatocrinin. This peptide can be used to promote growth of warm blooded animals, particularly hogs, of cold blooded animals and in aquiculture. In terms of the composition of hGRF, bovine GRF bGRF may be expressed as the analog EAsn28,Arg34 Gln38,Lys ,Val hGRF l 44 NH2 which means it has the formula H Tyr Ala Asp Ala Ile Phe Thr Asn Ser Tyr Arg Lys Val Leu Gly Gln Leu Ser Ala Arg Lys Leu Leu Gln Asp Ile Met Asn Arg Gln Gln Gly Glu Arg Asn Gln Glu Gln Gly Ala LysVal Arg Leu NH2. It is hereinafter referred to as bGRF or bovine somatocrinin. Caprine GRF has the same formula and can be used to promote growth of warm blooded animals, particularly cattle, of cold blooded animals and in aquiculture. It may also be used to increase milk production in cows and in goats in order to provide milk for making specialty cheeses. In terms of the composition of hGRF, ovine GRF oGRF may be expressed as the analog E11e131Asn281 Arg ,Gln38,Lys41,Va142 hGRF l 44 NH2 which means it has the formula H Tyr Ala Asp Ala Ile Phe Thr Asn Ser Tyr Arg Lys Ile Leu Gly Gln Leu Ser Ala Arg Lys Leu Leu Gln Asp Ile Met Asn Arg Gln Gln Gly Glu Arg Asn Gln Glu Gln Gly Ala Lys Val Arg Leu NH2. It is hereinafter referred to as oGRF or ovine somatocrinin.This peptide can be used to promote growth of warmblooded animals, particularly sheep, of cold blooded animals and in aquiculture. It may also be used to increase milk production in ewes in order to provide milk for making specialty cheeses. Veterinary and pharmaceutical compositions in accordance with the invention include either pGRF, bGRF or oGRF, an analog thereof or a biologically active fragment thereof, or a nontoxic salt of any of the foregoing, dispersed in a pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable liquid or solid carrier. Such compositions can be used in clinical medicine, both human and veterinary, in acute or chronic administration for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. Moreover, they can be used to accelerate the growth of muscle mass and or milk production in hogs, cattle, goats, sheep or other animals. EMI3.1 The nomenclature used to define the peptides is that specified by Schroder Lubke, The Peptides ,Academic Press 1965 , wherein in accordance with conventional representation the amino group at theN terminal appears to the left and the carboxyl group at the C terminal to the right. Where the amino acid residue has isomeric forms, it is the L form of the amino acid that is represented unless otherwise expressly indicated. The invention provides synthetic GRF peptides having the following formula H Tyr Ala Asp Ala IlePhe Thr Asn Ser Tyr Arg Lys R13 Leu Gly Gln Leu SerAla Arg Lys Leu Leu Gln Asp Ile Met R28 Arg Gln Gln Gly Glu Arg Asn Gln Glu Glo Gly Ala R41 Val Arg Leu Y wherein R13 is Val or Ile R28 is Ser or Asn R41 is Arg or Lys and Y is OH or NH2.Also included are biologically active fragments extending from theN terminus to at least about residue 28 or to at least about residue34 for pGRF where Y can be either OH or NH 2 The peptides can be synthesized by any suitable method, such as by exclusively solid phase techniques, by partial solid phase techniques, by fragment condensation, by classical solution couplings, or by the employment of recently developed recombinant DNA techniques. For example, the techniques of exclusively solid phase synthesis are set forth in the textbook Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis , Stewart Young,Freeman Co., San Francisco, 1969, and are exemplified by the disclosure of U.S. Patent No. 4,105,603, issuedAugust 8, 1978. The fragment condensation method of synthesis is exemplified in U.S.Patent No. 3,972,859 August 3, 1976 . Other available syntheses are exemplified by U.S. Patent No. 3,842,067 October 15, 1974 and U.S. Patent No. 3,862,925 January 28, 1975 .Production of the synthetic peptides using recombinantEMI3.2 EMI3.3 DNA techniques will likely be used to satisfy large scale commercial requirements. Synthesis by the use of recombinant DNA techniques, for purposes of this application, should be understood to include the suitable employment of a structural gene coding for a form of GRF. The syntheticGRF may be obtained by transforming a microorganism using an expression vector including a promoter and operator together with such structural gene and causing such transformed microorganism to express GRF. A non human animal may also be used to produce GRF by gene farming using such a structural gene and the general techniques set forth in U.S. Patent No.4,276,282 issued June 30, 1981 or using microinjection of embryos as described in WO83 01783 published 26 May 1983 and W082 04443 published 23 December 1982. The synthetic GRF may also be produced directly in the animal for which accelerated growth is intended by the techniques described in the two WO publications. Common to coupling type syntheses is the protection of the labile side chain groups of the various amino acid moieties with suitable protecting groups which will prevent a chemical reaction from occurring at that site until the group is ultimately removed. Usually also common is the protection of an alpha amino group on an amino acid or a fragment while that entity reacts at the carboxyl group, followed by the selective removal of the alpha amino protecting group to allow subsequent reaction to take place at that location. Accordingly, it is common that, as a step in the synthesis, an intermediate compound is produced which includes each of the amino acid residues located in its desired sequence in the peptide chain with side chain protecting groups linked to the appropriate residues. Also considered to be within the scope of the present invention are intermediates of the formula X1 Tyr X2 Ala Asp X3 Ala Ile Phe Thr X4 Asn Ser X5 Tyr X2 Arg X6 Lys X7 R13 Leu Gly Gln Leu Ser X5 Ala 6 7 3 5Arg X Lys X Leu Leu Gln Asp X Ile Met R28 X 6 3 6 3Arg X Gln Gln Gly Glu X Arg X Asn Gln Glu X Gln Gly Ala R41 X6 or X7 Val Arg X6 Leu X wherein X is either hydrogen or an amino protecting group. Theo amino protecting groups contemplated by X1 are those known to be useful in the art of step wi se synthesis of polypeptides. Among the classes of alpha amino protecting groups covered by X1 are 1 acyl type protecting groups, such as formyl, trifluoroacetyl, phthalyl, toluenesulfonyl Tos , benzensulfonyl, nitrophenylsulfenyl, tritylsulfenyl, o nitrophenoxyacetyl, chloroacetyl, acetyl, and 6 chlorobutyryl 2 aromatic urethan type protecting groups, such as benzyloxycarbonyl Z and substituted Z, such as p chlorobenzyloxycarbonyl, p nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl, p bromobenzyloxycarbonyl, p methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl 3 aliphatic urethan protecting groups, such as t butyloxycarbonyl BOC , dii sopropylmethyloxycarbonyl, i sopropyloxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl, allyloxyearbonyl 4 cycloalkyl urethan type protecting groups, such as cyclopentyloxycarbonyl, adamantyloxycarbonyl, and cyclohexyloxycarbonyl 5 thiourethan type protecting groups, such as phenylthiocarbonyl 6 alkyl type protecting groups, such as triphenylmethyl trityl , benzyl 7 trialkylsilane groups, such as trimethylsilane.The preferred amino protecting group is BOC. x2 is a protecting group for the phenolic hydroxyl group of Tyr selected from the group consisting of tetrahydropyranyl, tert butyl, trityl, Bzl, CBZ, 4Br CBZ and 2,6 dichlorobenzyl. The preferred 2 protecting group is 2,6 dichlorobenzyl. X can be hydrogen which means that there is no protecting group on the hydroxyl group. X3 is hydrogen or an ester forming protecting group for the carboxyl group of Asp or Glu and is selected from the group consisting of Bzl, 2,6 dichlorobenzyl, methyl and ethyl. X4 and X5 are protecting groups for the hydroxyl group of Thr and Ser and are selected from the group consisting of acetyl, benzoyl, tert butyl, trityl, tetrahydropyranyl, Bzl, 2,6 dichlorobenzyl and CBZ. The preferred protecting group is Bzl. X4 and or 5 can be hydrogen, which means there is no protecting group on the hydroxyl group. X6 is a protecting group for the guanidino group of Arg selected from the group consisting of nitro, Tos, CBZ, adamantyloxycarbonyl, and BOC, or is hydrogen X7 is hydrogen or a protecting group for the side chain amino substituent of Lys. Illustrative of suitable side chain amino protecting groups are 2 chlorobenzyloxycarbonyl 2 C1 Z , Tos, CBZ, t amyloxycarbonyl and BOC. The selection of a side chain amino protecting group is not critical except that it must be one which is not removed during deprotection of theO amino groups during the synthesis. Hence, the amino protecting group and the side chain amino protecting group cannot be the same. Optionally the side chain amido group of Gln and or Asn can be suitably protected as with xanthyl Xan . X8 is selected from the class consisting ofOH, OCH3, esters, amides, hydrazides, O CH2 resin support and NH resin support, with the groups other than OH and amides being broadly considered as protecting groups. In the formula for the intermediate, at least 1 2 X1, X2, 3 4 5 6 7 one of X3 X4, X , X6, X7, and 8X is a protecting group. In selecting a particular side chain protecting group to be used in the synthesis of the peptides, the following rules are followed a the protecting group should he stable to the reagent and under the reaction conditions selected for removing theD amino protecting group at each step of the synthesis, b the protecting group should retain its protecting properties and not be split off under coupling conditions, and c the side chain protecting group should be removable, upon the completion of the synthesis containing the desired amino acid sequence, under reaction conditions that will not alter the peptide chain. The peptides are preferably prepared using solid phase synthesis, such as that described byMerrifield, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 85, p 2149 1963 , although other equivalent chemical syntheses known in the art can also be used as previously mentioned.Solid phase synthesis is commenced from the C terminal end of the peptide by coupling a protected amino acid to a suitable resin. Such a starting material can be prepared by attachingD amino protected Leu by an ester linkage to a chloromethylated resin or a hydroxymethyl resin, or by an amide bond to a BHA resin or MBHA resin. The preparation of the hydroxymethyl resin is described by Bodansky et al., Chem. Ind. London 38, 1597 98 1966 . Chloromethylated resins are commercially available from Bio Rad Laboratories,Richmond, California and from Lab. Systems, Inc. The preparation of such a resin is described by Stewart et al., Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis Freeman Co., SanFrancisco 1969 , Chapter 1, pp 1 6.BHA and MBHA resin supports are commercially available and are generally used only when the desired polypeptide being synthesized has an i carboxamide at the C terminal. Leu protected by BOC is coupled to the chloromethylated resin according to the procedure ofMonahan and Gilon, Biopolymer 12, pp 2513 19, 1973 when, for example, it is desired to synthesize the 44 amino acid peptide with free carboxy terminal. Following the coupling of BOC Leu, thed amino protecting group is removed, as by using trifluoroacetic acid TFA in methylene chloride, TFA alone or HC1 in dioxane. The deprotection is carried out at a temperature between about OOC and room temperature. Other standard cleaving reagents and conditions for removal of specificY amino protecting groups may be used as described in Schroder BR Lubke, The Peptides , 1 pp 72 75 Academic Press 1965 . After removal of the amino protecting group of Leu, the remaining O amino and side chain protected amino acids are coupled step wise in the desired order to obtain the intermediate compound defined hereinbefore, or as an alternative to adding each amino acid separately in the synthesis, some of them may be coupled to one another prior to addition to the solid phase reactor. The selection of an appropriate coupling reagent is within the skill of the art. Particularly suitable as a coupling reagent is N,N dicyclohexyl carbodiimide DCCI . The activating reagents used in the solid phase synthesis of the peptides are well known in the peptide art. Examples of suitable activating reagents are 1 carbodiimides, such as N,N diisopropyl carbodiimide, N N dicyclohexylcarbodiimide DCCI 2 cyanamides such as 8,N dibenzylcyanamide 3 keteimines, 4 isoxazolium salts, such as N ethyl 5 phenyl isoxazolium 3 sulfonate 5 monocyclic nitrogen containing heterocyclic amides of aromatic character containing one through four nitrogens in the ring, such as imidazolides, pyrazolides, and 1,2,4 triazolides. Specific heterocyclic amides that are useful include N,N carbonyl diimidazole, N,N carbonyl di 1,2,4 triazole 6 alkoxylated acetylene, such as ethoxyacetylene 7 reagents which form a mixed anhydride with the carboxyl moiety of the amino acid, such as ethylchloroformate and isobutylchloroformate and 8 reagents which form an active ester with the carboxyl moiety of the amino acid, such as nitrogen containing heterocyclic compounds having a hydroxy group on one ring nitrogen, e.g.N hydroxyphthalimide, N hydroxysuccinimide and l hydroxybenzotriazole HOBT . Other activating reagents and their use in peptide coupling are described bySchroder Lubke supra, in Chapter III and by Kapoor, J.Phar. Sci., 59, pp 1 27 1970 . Each protected amino acid or amino acid sequence is introduced into the solid phase reactor in about a twofold or more excess, and the coupling may be carried out in a medium of dimethylformamide DMF CH2C12 1 1 or in DMF or CH2C12 alone. In cases where incomplete coupling occurred, the coupling procedure is repeated before removal of theO amino protecting group prior to the coupling of the next amino acid. The success of the coupling reaction at each stage of the synthesis is monitored by the ninhydrin reaction, as described by E. Kaiser et al., Anal. Biochem. 34, 595 1970 . After the desired amino acid sequence has been completed, the intermediate peptide is removed from the resin support by treatment with a reagent, such as liquid hydrogen fluoride, which not only cleaves the peptide from the resin but also cleaves all remaining side chain protecting groups X2, X3, X4, X5,X6, X7 and x8 and the amino protecting groupX1, to obtain the peptide. As an alternative route, the intermediate peptide may be separated from the resin support by alcoholysis after which the recovered C terminal alkyl ester is converted to the acid by hydrolysis. Any side chain protecting groups may then be cleaved as previously described or by other known procedures, such as catalytic reduction e.g. Pd on BaSO4 . When using hydrogen fluoride for cleaving, anisole and methylethyl sulfide are included in the reaction vessel for scavenging. The following Examples set forth preferred methods for synthesizing GRF by the solid phase technique. It will of course be appreciated that the EXAMPLE I The synthesis of pGRF 1 44 free acid having the formula H Tyr Ala Asp Ala Ile Phe Thr Asn Ser Tyr Arg Lys Val Leu Gly Gln Leu Ser Ala Arg Lys Leu Leu Gln Asp Ile Met Ser Arg Gln Gln Gly u Arg Asn Gln Glu Gln Gly Ala Arg Val Arg Leu OH is conducted in a stepwise manner using aBeckman 990 Peptide Synthesizer on a chloromethylated resin, such as that available from Lab Systems, Inc., containing 0.9 Meq Cl g. Coupling of BOC Leu to the resin is performed by the general procedure set forth byMonahan et al. in Biopolymers, Volume 12 1973 pp.2513 2519, and it results in the substitution of about 0.22 mmol. Leu per gram of resin. All solvents that are used are carefully degassed by sparging with an inert gas, preferably helium, to insure the absence of oxygen that might undesirably oxidize the sulfur of the Met residue. After deprotection and neutralization, the peptide chain is built step by step on the resin.Deprotection, neutralization and addition of each amino acid is performed in general accordance with the procedure set forth in detail in Guillemin et al. U.S.Patent No. 3,904,594. The couplings are specifically carried out as set out in the following Schedule A SCHEDULE MIX TIMESSTEP REAGENTS AND OPERATIONS MIN. 1 CH2C12 wash 2 times 0.5 2 50 trifluoroacetic acid TFA 0.5 58 1,2 ethanedithiol in CH2C12 1 time 3 508 trifluoroacetic acid TFA 20.0 5 1,2 ethanedithiol in CH2C12 1 time 4 CH2C12 wash 3 times 0.5 5 CH3OH wash 2 times 0.5 6 10 triethylamine Et3N in CH2C12 0.5 neutralization 2 times 7 CH30H wash 2 times 0.5 8 10 triethylamine Et3N in CH2C12 0.5 neutralization 2 times 9 CH3OH wash 2 times 0.5 10 CH2C12 wash 2 times 0.5 11 Boc amino acid 1 mmole g resin plus equivalent amount of 120 dicyclohexylcarbodiimide DCC in CH2C12 12 CH2C12 wash 1 time 0.5 13 50 dimethylformamide in CH2C12 0.5 wash 2 times 14 10 triethylamine Et3N in CH2C12 0.5 wash 1 time 15 CH3OH wash 2 times 0.5 16 CH2C12 wash 2 times 0.5 17 25 acetic anhydride in CH2C12 20.0 2 ml g resin 18 CH2C12 wash 2 times 0.5 19 CH3OH wash 2 times 0.5 For the coupling of Asn and Gln,an 1.136 molar excess of l hydroxybenzotriazole HOBt was included in this step. Briefly, for the coupling reaction, one mmol.of BOC protected amino acid in methylene chloride is used per gram of resin, plus one equivalent of 0.5 molarDCCI in methylene chloride or 30 DMF in methylene chloride, for two hours. When Arg is being coupled, a mixture of 10 DMF and methylene chloride is used. Bzl is used as the hydroxyl side chain protecting group forSer and Thr. 2 chloro benzyloxycarbonyl 2C1 Z is used as the protecting group for the Lys side chain. Tos is used to protect the guanidino group of Arg, and the Glu or Asp carboxyl group is protected as the Bzl ester.The phenolic hydroxyl group of Tyr is protected with 2,6 dichlorobenzyl. At the end of the synthesis, the following composition is obtained 1 2 3 4 5X1 Tyr X2 Ala Asp X3 Ala Ile Phe Thr X4 Asn Ser X5 Tyr X2 Arg X6 Lys X7 Val Leu Gly Gln Leu Ser X5 Ala 6 7 3 5Arg X Lys X Leu Leu Gln Asp X Ile Met Ser X Arg X6 Gln Gln Gly Glu X3 Arg X6 Asn Gln Glu X3 Gln 6 Val Arg X6 Leu X8 wherein 6 8 1Gly Ala Arg X Val Arg X Leu X wherein X is BOC, X2 is 2,6 dichlorobenzyl, X3 is benyzl ester,X4 is Bzl, X5 is Bzl, X is Tos, X is 2C1 Z and 8 is O CH2 benzene polystyrene resin support. After the final Tyr residue has been coupled to the resin, the BOC group is removed with 45 TFA inCH2C12. In order to cleave and deprotect the remaining protected peptide resin, it is treated with 1.5 ml. anisole, 0.25 ml. methylethylsulfide and 10 ml.hydrogen fluoride HF per gram of peptide resin, at 2O0C. for one half hour and at O. C. for one half hour. After elimination of the HF under high vacuum, the resin peptide remainder is washed alternately with dry dimethyl ether and chloroform, and the peptide is then extracted with degassed 2N aqueous acetic acid.Lyophilization of the acetic acid extract provides a white fluffy material. The cleaved and deprotected peptide is then dissolved in 30t acetic acid and subjected to SephadexG 50 fine gel filtration. The peptide is then further purified by CM 32 carboxymethyl cellulose Whatman cation exchange chromatography l.8x 18 cm., Vbed 50 ml. using a concave gradient generated by dropping 1 L. of 0.4 M NH4OAc, pH 6.5 into a mixing flask containing 400 ml.0.01 M. NH4OAc, pH 4.5. Final purification is carried out using partition chromatography on Sephadex G 50 fine support Pharmacia with a nBuOH EtOH pyridine 0.2t NHOAc 4 1 1 7 solvent system. Purification details are generally set forth in Ling et al. Biochem. Biophys.Res. Commun. 95, 945 1980 . The chromatographic fractions are carefully monitored by TLC, and only the fractions showing substantial purity are pooled. The synthesis is repeated using an MBHA resin to produce the same peptide having an amidatedC terminus, generally following the procedure described in U.S. Patent No. 4,292,313 to link Leu to the MBHA resin. EXAMPLE II To determine the effectiveness of the peptide to promote the release of growth hormone, in vitro assays are carried out using synthetic hGRF 1 44 NH2 in side by side comparison with pGRF 1 44 NH2 and of a GRF Reference Standard having a known effectiveness to promote the release of growth hormone from pituitary cells. The GRF Reference standard is described and defined in Brazeau, et al., Endocrinology, Vol. 110,A538 1982 and is an amount of a preparation of rat hypothalamic origin that produces a half maximal response in terms of GH release in a pituitary cell monolayer bioassay. Cultures are used which include cells of rat pituitary glands removed some four to five days previously.Both cultures of a defined standard medium and cultures which are considered optimal for the secretion of growth hormone are used for the comparative testing, in the general manner described in Brazeau, et al. Regulatory Peptides, 1, 255, 1981. Incubation with the substance to be tested is carried out for 3 to 4 hours, and aliquots of the culture medium are removed and processed to measure their contents in inmunoreactive GH ir GH by a well characterized radioimmunoassay. The results of this comparative testing shows that, in equimolar ratios, pGRF 1 44 SH2 has the full intrinsic biological activity of the synthetic hGRF peptide and close to the same potency. EXAMPLE III The synthesis of bGRF 1 44 amide having the formula H Tyr Ala Asp Ala I 1e Phe Thr Asn Ser Tyr Arg 1 ys Val Leu Gly Gln Leu Ser Ala Arg Lys Leu Leu Gln Asp Ile Met Asn Arg Gln Gln Gly Glu Arg Asn Gln Glu Gln Gly Ala Lys Val Arg Leu NHz is conducted in a stepwise manner using aBeckman 990 Peptide Synthesizer and an MBHA resin.Coupling of BOC Leu to the resin is performed by the general procedure set forth in U.S. Patent No.4,292,313, and it results in the substitution of about 0.2 0.6 mmol Leu per gram of resin depending on the substitution of the MHBA resin used. All solvents that are used are carefully degassed by sparging with an inert gas, preferably helium, to insure the absence of oxygen that might undesirably oxidize the sulfur of theMet residue. After deprotection and neutralization, the peptide chain is built step by step on the resin.Deprotection, neutralization and addition of each amino acid is performed in general accordance with the procedure set forth in detail in Guillemin et al. U.S.Patent No. 3,904,594. The couplings are specifically carried out as set out in Schedule A of Example I. The coupling reactions are carried out as described in Example I, and at the end of the synthesis, the following composition is obtained Xl Tyr X2 Ala Asp X3 Ala Ile Phe Thr X4 Asn Ser X Tyr X2 Arg X6 Lys X7 Val Leu Gly Gln Leu Ser X5 Ala Arg X6 Lys X7 Leu Leu Gln Asp X3 Ile Met AsnArg X6 Gln Gln Gly Glu X3 Arg X6 Asn Gln Glu X3 Gln 7 6 8 Gly Ala Lys X Val Arg X Leu X wherein X1 is BOC, X2 is 2,6 dichlorobenzyl, X3 is benyzl ester, X is Bzl, X5 is Bzl, X6 is Tos,X7 is 2C1 Z and X8 is NH MBHA resin support. After the final Tyr residue has been coupled to the resin, the BOC group is removed with 45t TFA inCH2C12. In order to cleave and deprotect the remaining protected peptide resin, it is treated with 1.5 ml. anisole, 0.25 ml. methylethylsulfide and 10 ml.hydrogen fluoride HF per gram of peptide resin, at 20eC. for one half hour and at 0 C. for one half hour.After elimination of the HF under high vacuum, the resin peptide remainder is washed alternately with dry diethyl ether and chloroform, and the peptide is then extracted with degassed 2N aqueous acetic acid.Lyophilization of the acetic acid extract provides a white fluffy material. The cleaved and deprotected peptide is then dissolved in 30 acetic acid and subjected to SephadexG 50 fine gel filtration. The peptide is then further purified using cation exchange chromatography followed by partition chromatography as set forth in Example I. The synthesis is repeated using a chloromethylated resin to produce the same peptide having a free acid C terminus, generally following the procedure described in Biopolymers, 12, 2513 19 1973 to link Leu to the chloromethylated resin. The synthesis is repeated using a chloromethylated resin to produce the same peptide having a free acid C terminus using the procedure ofExample I. EXAMPLE IV To determine the effectiveness of the peptide to promote the release of growth hormone, in vitro assays are carried out using synthetic hGRF 1 44 NH2 in side by side comparison with equimolar concentrations of bGRF 1 44 KH2, as set forth hereinbefore inExample II. The results of this comparative testing shows that, in equimolar ratios, bGRF 1 44 NH2 has the full intrinsic biological activity of the synthetic peptide and close to the same potency. In multiple doses factorial design experiments, bGRF is shown to have the same intrinsic activity as hGRF 1 44 NH2 and a specific activity equal to about 70 of hGRF 1 44 NH2 with confidence limits of 54 93 .

At the end of the synthesis, the following composition is obtained 1 2 3 4 5 x Tyr X Ala Asp X3 Ala Ile Phe Thr X J Asn ser X5 Tyr X2 Arg X6 Lys X7 Ile Leu Gly Gln Leu Ser X5 Ala 6 7 3Arg X Lys X Leu Leu Gln Asp X Ile Met Asn 6 3 6 3Arg X Gln Gln Gly Glu X Arg X Asn Gln Glu X Gln Gly Ala Lys X7 Val Arg X6 Leu X8 wherein X1 is BOC, X2 is 2,6 dichlorobenzyl, X3 is benyzl ester, X4 is Bzl, X5 is Bzl, X6is Tos, 7X is 2Cl Z and x8 is NH MBHA resin support. After the final Tyr residue has been coupled to the resin, the BOC group is removed with 45 TFA in CH2Cl2. Cleavage and deprotection of the remaining protected peptide resin is carried out as specified inExample III. The cleaved and deprotected peptide is dissolved in 30 acetic acid, subjected to Sephadex G 50 fine gel filtration, cation exchange chromatography and finally to partition chromatography as set forth inExample I. The synthesis is repeated using a chloromethylated resin to produce the same peptide having a free acid C terminus following the procedure described in Example I. EXAMPLE VI To determine the effectiveness of the peptide to promote the release of growth hormone, in vitro assays are carried out using synthetic hGRF 1 44 NH2 in side by side comparison with equimolar concentrations of the synthetic oGRF 1 44 NH2 of Example V as set forth hereinbefore in Example II. The results of this comparative testing shows that, in equimolar ratios, the oGRF 1 44 has the full intrinsic biological activity of the synthetic peptide and close to the same potency. In multiple doses factorial design experiments, oGRF is shown to have about the same intrinsic activity as hGRF 1 44 NH2 and a specific activity equal to about 70 of hGRF 1 44 NH2. Chronic administration of synthetic pGRF, bGRF and oGRF peptides to farm animals, particularly hogs, cattle, goats and sheep, or other warm blooded animals is expected to promote anabolism and thus increase body weight in terms of muscle mass. The use in veterinary medicine of the GRF of its species, i.e. oGRF in sheep, bGRF in cattle or goats, is the ideal situation since the molecule injected or otherwise administered will not be antigenic, being of the same species as that of the animal treated. It should also increase milk production in the female of the species. Use in aquiculture for raising fish and other cold blooded marine animals to accelerate growth may also be important.Administration to animals at a purity as low as about 5 may be acceptable and will generally be carried out using a combination of the peptide and a veterinarily acceptable solid or liquid carrier to form what for purposes of this application is broadly termed a pharmaceutical composition. Synthetic GRF or the nontoxic salts thereof, combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier to form a pharmaceutical composition, may be administered to mammals, including humans, either intravenously, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, intranasally or orally. The administration may be employed by a physician to stimulate the release of growth hormone where the host being treated requires such therapeutic treatment. The required dosage will vary with the particular condition being treated, with the severity of the condition and with the duration of desired treatment. Such peptides are often administered in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable nontoxic salts, such as acid addition salts or metal complexes, e.g., with zinc, iron or the like which are considered as salts for purposes of this application . Illustrative of such acid addition salts are hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulphate, phosphate, maleate, acetate, citrate, benzoate, succinate, malate, ascorbate, tartrate and the like. If the active ingredient is to be administered in tablet form1 the tablet may contain a binder, such as tragacanth, corn starch or gelatin a disintegrating agent, such as alginic acid and a lubricant, such as magnesium stearate. If administration in liquid form is desired, sweetening and or flavoring may be used, and intravenous administration in isotonic saline, phosphate buffer solutions or the like may be effected. The peptides should be administered under the guidance of a physician, and pharmaceutical compositions will usually contain the peptide in conjunction with a conventional, pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.Usually, the dosage will be from about 20 to about 2000 nanograms of the peptide per kilogram of the body weight of the host. Although the invention has been described with regard to its preferred embodiments, which constitute the best mode presently known to the inventors, it should be understood that various changes and modifications as would be obvious to one having the ordinary skill in this art may be made without departing from the scope of the invention which is set forth in the claims appended hereto.For example, modifications in the 44 member chain, particularly deletions beginning at the carboxyl terminal of the peptide, can be made in accordance with the known experimental evidence previously obtained with hGRF and following the practises to date to create fragments 34 to 43 residues in length, e.g. pGRF 1 34 , bGRF 1 35 , oGRF 1 40 and oGRF 1 37 , or even shorter fragments, i.e. oGRF 1 32 bGRF 1 29 and oGRF 1 27 , which fragments may have either NH2 or OH at the C terminal, that retain the intrinsic biological activity of the peptide, and such shorter peptides are considered as being within the scope of the invention. Moreover, additions can be made to either terminal, or to both terminals, and or generally equivalent residues can be substituted for naturally occurring residues, as is well known in the overall art of peptide chemistry to produce analogs having at least a substantial portion of the potency of the native polypeptide without deviating from the scope of the invention.
