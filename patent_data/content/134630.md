# Sterile docking process, apparatus and system for thermoplastic resin tubes.

## Abstract
A process, apparatus and system for making a sterile connection between thermoplastic resin tubes 20, 21 is disclosed. A section of each tube 20, 21 is flattened and a hot cutting means 34 is urged through the flattened sections so as to seal temporarily each tube 20, 21 and to provide molten tube ends 37, 38, 39, 40 . The tubes 20, 21 are aligned with each other and then the desired molten tube ends 37, 40 are urged together to form a joint between the tubes 20, 21 for each pair of tube ends 37, 40 to be connected. Each joint is cooled and then subjected to light stress to open the temporary seal in each tube, thereby providing fluid communication between the joined tubes.
