# Position transmitters.

## Abstract
A position transmitter 8 includes a d c power supply 10 having a positive terminal connected to an input line 12 and a negative terminal connected, through a system controller 14 having a variable load, to an output line 16 . A voltage divider including a potentiometer 30 is connected across the input and output lines 12, 16 . A wiper 28 of the potentiometer 30 is mechanically connected to a movable member 24 of an actuator device 22 so that a variable voltage is applied between the input and output lines 12, 16 . The wiper 28 is electrically connected to a negative input of a zero adjust amplifier 50 which has an adjustable positive input. The movable member 24 is moved to its zero position which also moves the wiper 28 to a zero position. At the zero position, the zero adjust amplifier 50 is adjusted to apply a 4 mA current to the output line 16 . This is done by applying the output of the zero adjust amplifier 50 through a series of amplifiers to the base of a transistor 60 , which has an emitter and collector connected across the input and output lines 12, 16 for converting the voltage signal into a current signal. A span adjust amplifier 54 has a negative input connected to the output of the zero adjust amplifier 50 and has an adjustable feedback 56 from its output to its negative input. The movable member 24 is moved to its maximum position, thus also moving the wiper 28 to a maximum position. The span adjust amplifier 54 is then controlled to a 20 mA current signal to the output line 16 . As the movable member 24 moves between its minimum and maximum position, a 4 20 mA signal which corresponds to the position of the movable member is applied to the output of the position transmitter.
