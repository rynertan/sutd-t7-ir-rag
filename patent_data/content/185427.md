## Description
The present application relates to block polyesters and like compounds useful as soil release agents in laundry detergent compositions. In addition to cleaning performance, laundry detergent compositions desirably have other benefits. One is the ability to confer soil release properties to fabrics woven from polyester fibers. These fabrics are mostly co polymers of ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid, and are sold under a number of tradenames, e.g. Dacron, Fortrel, Kodel and Blue C Polyester. The hydrophobic character of polyester fabrics makes their laundering difficult, particularly as regards, oily soil and oily stains. The oily soil or stain preferentially wets the fabric. As a result, the oily soil or stain is difficult to remove in an aqueous laundering process. High molecular weight e.g., 40,000 to 50,000 M.W. polyesters containing random ethylene terephthalate polyethylene glycol PEG terephthalate units have been used as soil release compounds in laundry detergent compositions. See U.S. A 3,962,152 to Nicol et al., issued June 8, 1976. During the laundering operation, these soil release polyesters adsorb onto the surface of fabrics immersed in the wash solution. The adsorbed polyester then forms a hydrophilic film which remains on the fabric after it is removed from the wash solution and dried. This film can be renewed by subsequent washing of the fabric with a detergent composition containing the soil release polyesters. These ethylene terephthalate PEG terephthalate polyesters are not very water soluble. It is believed that they form a suspension in the wash solution which does not adsorb efficiently onto the fabrics. As a result, the level of soil release polyester in the detergent composition has to be increased if benefits are to be obtained after several wash cycles. Because of this poor water solubility, these polyesters are formulated as suspensions in laundry detergent compositions, rather than as isotropic liquids. In certain detergent formulations, these polyesters can also diminish clay soil cleaning performance. U.S. A 3,416,952 to McIntyre et al., issued December 17, 1968, discloses the treatment of shaped polyester articles with a water insoluble crystallizable polymeric compound which can contain a water solvatable polymeric group such as a polyoxyalkylene group having an average molecular weight of from 300 6000. Preferred polyoxyalkylene groups are the PEGs having an average molecular weight of from 1000 4000. Treatment of the shaped articles is carried out by applying an aqueous dispersion of the crystallizable polymeric compound in the presence of an anti oxidant, followed by heating to a temperature above 90 C to obtain a durable coating of the compound on the shaped article. Example 6 discloses one such crystallizable polymeric compound formed by the reaction of dimethyl terephthalate, ethylene glycol and an U.S. A 4,427,557 to Stockburger, filed February 15, 1983, issued January 24, 1984, discloses low molecular weight copolyesters M.W. 2,000 to 10,000 which can be used in aqueous dispersions to impart soil release properties to polyester fibers. The copolyesters are formed by the reaction of ethylene glycol, a PEG having an average molecular weight of 200 to 1000, an aromatic dicarboxylic acid e.g. dimethyl terephthalate , and a sulfonated aromatic dicarboxylic acid e.g. dimethyl 5 sulfoisophthalate . The PEG can be replaced in part with monoalkylethers of PEG such as the methyl, ethyl and butyl ethers. A dispersion or solution of the copolyester is applied to the textile material and then heat set at elevated temperatures 90 to 150 C to impart durable soil release properties. U.S. A 4,349,688 to Sandler, issued September 14, 1982, discloses polyoxyalkylene ester soil release agents, in particular monomeric polyesters of PEG and terephthalic acid having the formula where n can range from 6 23 and X is either methyl or H. Example IV discloses the preparation of one such PEG terephthalate polyester formed from terephthaloyl chloride and Carbowax 400 n 9, X H . Durable soil resistancy and water wicking properties are imparted by wetting the fabric with a composition containing the polyoxyalkylene ester, drying the wetted fabric, and then curing the dried fabric at a temperature of from 190 200 C for about 45 90 seconds. U.S. A 3,959,230 to Hays, issued May 25, 1976, discloses polyester soil release agents containing random ethylene terephthalate PEG terephthalate units in a mole ratio of from about 25 75 to about 35 65. These soil release polyesters have a molecular weight of from about 25,000 to about 55,000, preferably from about 40,000 to about 55,000 and are used in dilute, aqueous solutions, preferably with an emulsifying agent present. Fabrics are immersed in this solution so that the soil release polyester adsorbs onto the fabric surface. The polyester forms a hydrophilic film which remains on the fibers after the fabric is removed from the solution and dried. See also U.S. 3,893,929 to Basadur, issued July 8, 1975 compositions for imparting soil release finish containing a polyester having an average molecular weight of 3000 5000 formed from terephthalic acid, PEG and ethylene glycol U.S. A 3,712,873 to Zenk, issued January 23, 1973 textile treating composition comprising fatty alcohol polyethoxylates quaternary ammonium compounds a polyester having average molecular weight of 3000 5000 formed from terephthalic acid, PEG and ethylene glycol and starch . U.S. A 3,962,152 to Nicol et al., issued June 8, 1976, discloses detergent compositions containing detergent surfactants and the ethylene terephthalate PEG terephthalate soil release polyesters disclosed in the Hays patent. See also U.S. A 4,116,885 to Derstadt et al., issued September 26, 1978 detergent compositions containing certain compatible anionic detergent surfactants and ethylene terephthalate PEG terephthalate soil release polyesters U.S. A 4,132,680 to Nicol, issued January 2, 1979 detergent compositions containing detergent surfactants a composition which disassociates to yield quaternary ammonium cations and an ethylene terephthalate PEG terephthalate soil release polyester . U.S. A 4,201,824 to Violland et al., issued May 6, 1980, discloses hydrophilic polyurethanes having soil release and antistatic properties useful in detergent compositions. These polyurethanes are formed from the reaction product of a base polyester with an isocyanate prepolymer reaction product of diisocyanate and macrodiol . Example VI discloses a base polyester formed from dimethyl terephthalate, dimethyl sulfoisophthalate, ethylene glycol and PEG molecular weight 300 which is reacted with a prepolymer formed from a PEG molecular weight 1,500 and toluene diisocyanate. The present invention relates to compounds of formula wherein each R¹ is a 1,4 phenylene moiety the R² consist essentially of ethylene moieties, 1,2 propylene moieties or a mixture thereof each X is ethyl or preferably methyl each n is from 12 to 43 u is from 3 to 10. The present invention further relates to detergent compositions, especially for laundry use, which comprise a soil release component having an effective amount of these compounds. These detergent compositions further comprise from 1 to 75 by weight of a nonionic, anionic, ampholytic, zwitterionic, or cationic detergent surfactant, or mixture thereof. In addition to these detergent surfactants, the detergent compositions can optionally comprise from 0 to 60 by weight of a detergent builder. The compounds of the present invention provide excellent soil release benefits to polyester fabrics during laundering, but without diminishing the clay soil cleaning performance of the detergent composition. These compounds can be used at lower levels in detergent compositions to provide soil release benefits at least equivalent to prior art high molecular weight ethylene terephthalate PEG terephthalate polyesters. Some of the compounds of the present invention can also be formulated to provide isotropic liquid detergent compositions. Certain of the soil release compounds of the present invention provide additional through the wash static control benefits to laundered fabrics. The compounds of the present invention also provide cleaning benefits in terms of greasy oily stain removal, as well as whiteness maintenance benefits. In addition, it is expected that the soil release compounds of the present invention will be more biodegradable than prior art ethylene terephthalate PEG terephthalate soil release polyesters. Figure 1 shows a ¹³C NMR spectrum of block polyester compounds of the present invention. Figure 2 shows an enlarged view of a portion of the ¹³C NMR spectrum shown in Figure 1. In this formula, the moiety forms the oligomer or polymer backbone of the compounds. It is believed that the structure of the backbone is what is important to the adsorption of the compounds on polyester fabrics during laundering. Groups X OCH₂CH₂ The R¹ moieties are essentially 1,4 phenylene moieties. As used herein, the term the R¹ moieties are essentially 1,4 phenylene moieties refers to compounds where the R¹ moieties consist entirely of 1,4 phenylene moieties, or are partially substituted with other arylene or alkarylene moieties, alkylene moieties, alkenylene moieties, or mixtures thereof. Arylene and alkarylene moieties which can be partially substituted for 1,4 phenylene include 1,3 phenylene, 1,2 phenylene, 1,8 naphthylene, 1,4 naphthylene, 2,2 biphenylene, 4,4 biphenylene and mixtures thereof. Alkylene and alkenylene moieties which can be partially substituted include ethylene, 1,2 propylene, 1,4 butylene, 1,5 pentylene, 1,6 hexamethylene, 1,7 heptamethylene, 1,8 octamethylene, 1,4 cyclohexylene, and mixtures thereof. For the R¹ moieties, the degree of partial substitution with moieties other than 1,4 phenylene should be such that the soil release properties of the compound are not adversely affected to any great extent. Generally, the degree of partial substitution which can be tolerated will depend upon the backbone length of the compound, i.e., longer backbones can have greater partial substitution for 1,4 phenylene moieties. Usually, compounds where the R¹ comprise from 50 to 100 1,4 phenylene moieties from 0 to 50 moieties other than 1,4 phenylene have adequate soil release activity. For example, polyesters made according to the present invention with a 40 60 mole ratio of isophthalic 1,3 phenylene to terephthalic 1,4 phenylene acid have adequate soil release activity. However, because most polyesters used in fiber making comprise ethylene terephthalate units, it is usually desirable to minimize the degree of partial substitution with moieties other than 1,4 phenylene for best soil release activity. Preferably, the R¹ moieties consist entirely of i.e., comprise 100 1,4 phenylene moieties, i.e. each R¹ moiety is 1,4 phenylene. The R² moieties are essentially ethylene moieties, or substituted ethylene moieties having C₁ C₄ alkyl or alkoxy substitutents. As used herein, the term the R² moieties are essentially ethylene moieties, or substituted ethylene moieties having C₁ C₄ alkyl or alkoxy substituents refers to compounds of the present invention where the R² moieties consist entirely of ethylene, or substituted ethylene moieties, or are partially substituted with other compatible moieties. Examples of these other moieties include linear C₃ C₆ alkylene moieties such as 1,3 propylene, 1,4 butylene, 1,5 pentylene or 1,6 hexamethylene, 1,2 cycloalkylene moieties such as 1,2 cyclohexylene, 1,4 cycloalkylene moieties such as 1,4 cyclohexylene and 1,4 dimethylenecyclohexylene, polyoxyalkylated 1,2 hydroxyalkylenes such as and oxyalkylene moieties such as CH₂CH₂OCH₂CH₂OCH₂CH₂ or CH₂CH₂OCH₂CH₂ . For the R² moieties, the degree of partial substitution with these other moieties should be such that the soil release properties of the compounds are not adversely affected to any great extent. Generally, the degree of partial substitution which can be tolerated will depend upon the backbone length of the compound, i.e., longer backbones can have greater partial substitution. Usually, compounds where the R² comprise from t 20 to 100 ethylene, or substituted ethylene moieties from 0 to 80 other compatible moieties have adequate soil release activity. For example, for polyesters made according to the present invention with a 75 25 mole ratio of diethylene glycol CH₂CH₂OCH₂CH₂ to ethylene glycol ethylene have adequate soil release activity. However, it is desirable to minimize such partial substitution, especially with oxyalkylene moieties, for best soil release activity. During the making of polyesters according to the present invention, small amounts of these oxyalkylene moieties as dialkylene glycols are typically formed from glycols in side reactions and are then incorporated into the polyester . Preferably, R² comprises from 80 to 100 ethylene, or substituted ethylene moieties, and from 0 to about 20 other compatible moieties. For the R² moieties, suitable ethylene or substituted ethylene moieties include ethylene, 1,2 propylene, 1,2 butylene, 1,2 hexylene, 3 methoxy 1,2 propylene and mixtures thereof. Preferably, the R² moieties are essentially ethylene moieties, 1,2 propylene moieties or mixtures thereof. Inclusion of a greater percentage of ethylene moieties tends to improve the soil release activity of the compounds. Surprisingly, inclusion of a greater percentage of 1,2 propylene moieties tends to improve the water solubility of the compounds. X is methyl or ethyl, and most preferably methyl. The value for each n is at least about 6, but is preferably at least 10. Typically, the value for each n is in the range of from 12 to 43. It has been found that the value of u needs to be at least 3 in order for the compounds of the present invention to have significant soil release activity. The compounds of the present invention are oligomers or low molecular weight polymers. Typically, the value of u ranges from 3 to 10 for the compounds of the present invention. Generally, the larger the u value, the less soluble is the compound, Also, as the value for n increases, the value for u should be increased so that the compound will deposit better on the fabric during laundering. Preferred compounds of the present invention are block polyesters having the formula wherein the R¹ moieties are all 1,4 phenylene moieties the R² moieties are essentially ethylene moieties, 1,2 propylene moieties or mixtures thereof each X is ethyl or preferably methyl each n is from 12 to 43 u is from 3 to 10 u typically ranges from 3 to 8, especially for those polymers from dimethyl terephthalate, ethylene glycol or 1,2 propylene glycol and methyl capped polyethylene glycol. The most water soluble of these linear block polyesters are those where u is from 3 to 5. The compounds of the present invention can be prepared by art recognized methods. Although the following synthesis description is for the preferred block polyesters of the present invention, other versions can be prepared by appropriate variation. The block polyesters of the present invention are typically formed from 1 ethylene glycol, 1,2 propylene glycol or a mixture thereof 2 a polyethylene glycol PEG capped at one end with a C₁ C₄ alkyl group 3 a dicarboxylic acid or its diester The respective amounts of these components are selected to prepare polyesters having the desired properties in terms of solubility and soil release properties. The capped PEG used to prepare polyesters of the present invention is typically methyl capped and can be formed by ethoxylation of the respective alcohol with ethylene oxide. Also, methyl capped PEGs are commercially available from Union Carbide under the trade name Methoxy Carbowax and from Aldrich Chemical Company under the name poly ethylene glycol methyl ether. These commercial methyl capped PEGs have molecular weights of, 550 n about 12 , 750 n about 16 , 1900 n about 43 , Terephthalic acid or its diester is the major dicarboxylic acid present. However, minor amounts of other aromatic dicarboxylic acids or their diesters , or aliphatic dicarboxylic acids or their diesters can be included to the extent that the soil release properties are substantially maintained. Illustrative examples of other aromatic dicarboxylic acids which can be used include isophthalic acid, phthalic acid, naphthalene dicarboxylic acids, anthracene dicarboxylic acids, biphenyl dicarboxylic acids, oxydibenzoic acids and the like, as well as mixtures of these acids. If aliphatic dicarboxylic acids are included, adipic, glutaric, succinic, trimethyladipic, pimelic, azelaic, sebacic, suberic, 1,4 cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid and or dodecanedioic acids can be used. The preferred method for preparing block polyesters of the present invention comprises reacting the desired mixture of lower dialkyl esters methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl of the dicarboxylic acid with a mixture of the glycol ethylene glycol, 1,2 propylene glycol or a mixture thereof and the capped PEG. The glycol esters and oligomers produced in this ester interchange reaction are then polymerized to the desired degree. The ester interchange reaction can be conducted in accordance with reaction conditions generally used for ester interchange reactions. This ester interchange reaction is usually conducted at temperatures of from 120 to 220 C in the presence of an esterification catalyst. Alcohol is formed and constantly removed thus forcing the reaction to completion. The temperature and pressure of the reaction are desirably controlled so that glycol does not distill from the reaction mixture. Higher temperatures can be used if the reaction is conducted under pressure. The catalysts used for the ester interchange reaction are those well known to the art. These catalysts include alkyl and alkaline earth metals, for example lithium, sodium, calcium, and magnesium, as well as transition and Group II B metals, for example antimony, maganese, cobalt, and zinc, usually as the respective oxides, carbonates, or acetates. Typically, antimony trioxide and calcium acetate are used. The extent of the ester interchange reaction can be monitored by the amount of alcohol liberated or the disappearance of the dialkyl esters of the dibasic acids in the reaction mixture as determined by high performance liquid chromatography HPLC or any other suitable method. The ester interchange reaction is desirably taken to more than 90 completion. Greater than 95 completion is preferred in order to decrease the amount of sublimates obtained in the polymerization step. If desired, stabilizers such as phosphorus and phosphoric acid and esters thereof can be added at the end of the ester interchange step. The purpose of the stabilizier is to inhibit degradation, oxidation, and other side reactions to destroy the catalytic activity of the ester interchange catalyst and to prevent precipitation of insoluble metal carboxylates. Typically, stabilizers are not used to make the polyesters of the present invention. When the ester interchange reaction is complete, the glycol ester products are then polymerized to produce polyesters. The desired degree of polymerization can be determined by HPLC and ¹³C NMR analysis. For commercial processes, the polymerization reaction is usually conducted at temperatures of from 200 to 280 C in the presence of a catalyst. Higher temperatures can be used but tend to produce darker colored products. Illustrative examples of catalysts useful for the polymerization step include antimony trioxide, germanium dioxide, titanium alkoxide, hydrated antimony pentoxide, and ester interchange catalysts such the as salts of zinc, cobalt, and maganese. Excess glycol and other volatiles liberated during the reaction are removed under vacuum. The reaction is continued until polymerization is nearly complete based on analysis by ¹³C NMR and or reverse phase HPLC and or gel phase permeation. In addition to the desired polyesters, the crude composition obtained after synthesis contains starting reactants, as well as intermediate products. Representative examples of specific block polyesters formed according to the present invention are as follows A linear block polyester made from dimethyl terephthalate, a methyl capped PEG and ethylene glycol was synthesized as follows A 0.9 g portion of butylated hydroxytoluene BHT was added to the reactants as an antioxidant and the reaction system was then equipped for distillation through a 10.16 cm 4 inch unpacked column. The system was placed under a nitrogen atmosphere and the temperature was raised to 175 C gradually in about 2 hrs with magnetic stirring once the reaction mixture melted. When methanol began to distill, the temperature was then raised to 205 C during the next 5 hrs. At this point, about 70 of the theoretical amount of methanol had distilled out. The temperature was then raised to 220 C and held at this temperature for the next 18 hrs. to give 93 of the theoretical amount of methanol. The receiving flask was then emptied and the reaction mixture cooled to 130 C. A vacuum was then applied with a steady flow of nitrogen being introduced below the level of the liquid reaction mixture through a fritted glass inlet. The temperature was gradually raised to 200 C and the vacuum held at 2.6 10 ³ atm 20 mm Hg. After approximately 15 hrs. at 200 C under vacuum , the reaction was essentially complete as indicated by ¹³C NMR which showed only trace quantities of residual CH₂OH groups. Reverse phase HPLC analysis using a column packed with hexyl capped silica particles and an acetonitrile water gradient elution showed a sizeable part of the polymer contained 4 or more terephthalate units per molecule. By appropriate variation of reaction conditions, similar polyesters can be prepared by substituting 1,2 propylene glycol for ethylene glycol. A linear block polyester made from terephthalic acid, a methyl capped PEG and ethylene glycol was synthesized as follows Twenty grams 0.12 moles of terephthalic acid and 22.4 g 0.36 moles of ethylene glycol MCB were heated together at 220 240 C in a short path distillation apparatus. Ethylene glycol which distilled out with the water was periodically replaced. After 13 hrs. of heating, the reaction mixture was cooled and the following were added The reaction system was gradually heated to 240 C with little distillate in evidence. A vacuum was then applied and the temperature was held at 240 250 C for 6 hrs. to give the desired polyester. Gel permeation chromatography indicated the apparent peak molecular weight was approximately 2200 relative to several polystyrene standards. A method for determining the degree of polymerization of the polyesters of the present invention involves 1 alcohol fractionation of the crude polyester composition obtained after synthesis 2 high performance liquid chromatographic HPLC separation of the methanol soluble fraction to yield additional fractions and 3 ¹³C NMR analysis to determine backbone length i.e. value for u of the polyesters present in each of the various HPLC fractions. While this method is described with respect to polyesters made from terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol, it should be suitable, with appropriate modifications, for analyzing other polyester versions of the present invention. The crude polyester composition obtained after synthesis is successively extracted with 2 propanol, ethanol and methanol to obtain a methanol soluble fraction which contains more of the desired active polyesters. One such fractionation was carried out as follows The crude polyester compositions of the present invention, such as those of Example 1, can be separated into various, identifiable fractions by HPLC. Typically, a chromatogram for identifying the various fractions of the crude polyester composition is developed using the following HPLC conditions Some of the peaks present in this crude chromatogram represent fractions of the polyester composition which contain little or none of the active soil release polyesters. Accordingly, a semi preparative HPLC procedure is used to obtain fractions containing more of the active polyesters for subsequent ¹³C NMR analysis. This semi preparative method involves separating the previously obtained methanol soluble fraction by HPLC into additional fractions using the following conditions The various fractions obtained by semi preparative HPLC can be analyzed by ¹³C NMR to determine the degree of polymerization of the polyesters present in each fraction. Figure 1 represents a ¹³C NMR spectrum of a polyester composition made similar to Example 1. Figure 2 represents an expanded view of a portion of the spectrum shown in Figure 1. Assignment of carbon resonances are made by comparison to model compounds and or spiking experiments. ¹³C NMR parameters are chosen to give quantitative information, i.e., peak areas can be used to determine relative levels of intermediate compounds and polyesters present in the semi preparative HPLC fraction. Chemical shift assignments of several key carbon resonances are shown in the following Table There are two ways to express the average degree of polymerization of the polyesters present in each fraction. The first is a ratio of areas determined by ¹³C NMR of the ethylene units S present in the polyester backbone relative to the methyl cap M of the PEG. This ratio S M is equal to Area 3 see Figure 1 divided by Area 1 see Figure 1 , which is then multiplied by 1 2. The second is a ratio of the average number of aromatic terephthalate units A present in the backbone relative to M. This second ratio A M equals Area 2 see Figure 1 divided by Area 1, which is then multiplied by 1 4. A more useful quantity is obtained by adjusting the observed A M ratio for the contribution of monoterephthalate polyesters, i.e. where u is 0. The adjusted A M value equals wherein f₁ is the mole fraction of monoterephthalate polyester area f₁ Total Area, see Figure 2 . Another important value is f₄ which represents the mole fraction of terephthalate present in polyesters having 3 or more terephthalate units Area f₄ Total Area, see Figure 2 . The results of ¹³C NMR analysis of the fractions obtained by semi preparative HPLC of a polyester composition made similar to Example 1 is shown in the following Table Twice the S M ratio equals the average number of ethylene units for the polyesters present in the fraction. Twice the adjusted A M ratio equals the average number of terephthalate units u 1 for the polyesters present in the fraction. By using these values, the qualitative composition of the polyester fraction in terms of backbone length u can be determined. The compounds of the present invention are particularly useful in detergent compositions to provide soil release properties. These compositions can be used as laundry detergents, laundry additives, and laundry pre treatments. The detergent compositions of the present invention comprise a soil release component which contains an effective amount of the soil release compounds previously defined. What is an effective amount will depend upon the particular soil release compounds used, the particular type of detergent formulation liquid, granular, etc. and the benefits desired. Usually, the soil release compounds are effective when included in an amount from about 0.01 to about 10 by weight of the composition. In terms of soil release benefits, preferred detergent compositions can comprise from about 0.1 to about 5 by weight of the soil release compounds, but typically comprise from about 0.3 to about 3 by weight of these compounds. For granular detergent formulations, the soil release component typically comprises the soil release compounds, plus any protective enrobing material. In making granular detergent formulations, the soil release compounds could be exposed to highly alkaline materials such as NaOH and KOH. The soil release compounds, in particular those having shorter backbones, can be degraded by alkaline environments, especially those above a pH of about 8.5. Accordingly, the soil release compounds are preferably enrobed in a material which protects them from the alkaline environment of a granular detergent formulation yet permits the soil release compounds to be dispersed in the laundering operation. Suitable enrobing materials include the nonionic surfactants, polyethylene glycols PEG , fatty acids, fatty acid esters of alcohols, diols and polyols, anionic surfactants, film forming polymers and mixtures of these materials. Examples of suitable nonionic surfactant enrobing materials are described in the Detergent Surfactant section of this application. Examples of suitable PEG enrobing materials are those having an average M.W. of from about 2,000 to 15,000, preferably from 3,000 to 10,000 and most preferably from 4,000 to 8,000. Examples of suitable fatty acid enrobing materials are the higher fatty acids having from 12 to 18 carbon atoms. Examples of suitable fatty acid ester enrobing materials include the sorbitan fatty acid esters e.g. sorbitan monolaurate . Other examples of suitable enrobing materials, including anionic surfactants and film forming polymers, are disclosed in U.S. A 4,486,327 to Murphy et al., issued December 4, 1984,. The soil release compounds can be enrobed according to the methods disclosed in this Murphy et al. patent. For liquid detergent formulations, the soil release component can be comprised entirely of soil release compounds or can further include a water soluble organic solvent or an hydrotrope to aid in dissolving the soil release compounds. Suitable organic solvents are usually aromatic and can include ethyl benzoate, phenoxyethanol, methyl o toluate, 2 methoxybenzyl alcohol and pyrrolidone. Suitable hydrotropes include the methyl capped PEGs and shorter backbone block polyesters, i.e. where u is 0 to 2. While these short backbone block polyesters do not have any significant soil release activity, they are water soluble. Accordingly, these short backbone polyesters function as hydrotropes for the longer backbone, water insoluble polyesters which have soil release activity. The amount, or even need for, organic solvents or hydrotropes to prepare liquid detergent formulations containing the soil release compounds of the present invention will depend upon the compounds used, especially what fraction thereof is water soluble, the ingredients present in the laundry detergent system, and whether an isotropic, homogeneous liquid is desired. For isotropic liquid detergent formulations, the soil release compounds need to be dissolved as much as possible which sometimes requires the use of organic solvents or hydrotropes. Also, it has been found that dissolving the compounds in the liquid detergent formulations makes them more effective as soil release agents. Besides organic solvents or hydrotropes, greater amounts of water soluble soil release compounds can be included in the soil release component to aid in the preparation of isotropic liquid detergent formulations. For example, soil release polyesters with backbones having from 3 to 5 u 3 to 5 ethylene terephthalate units and having a methyl capped PEG of molecular weight of 750 n about 16 at each end are water soluble. In addition, soil release polyesters prepared from dimethyl terephthalate, ethylene glycol and methyl capped PEGs typically contain a substantial fraction of water soluble polyesters both active and inactive types which aid in dissolving water insoluble soil release polyesters in the liquid detergent formulation. Partial or total substitution of 1,2 propylene glycol for ethylene glycol can also be used to increase the solubility of the soil release polyesters. The more water soluble 1,2 propylene glycol based soil release polyesters are particularly useful in making isotropic liquid detergent formulations which have a large number of ingredients and low water content. The amount of detergent surfactant included in the detergent compositions of the present invention can vary from 1 to 75 by weight of the composition depending upon the detergent surfactant s used, the type of composition to be formulated e.g. granular, liquid and the effects desired. Preferably, the detergent surfactant s comprises from 10 to 50 by weight of the composition, and most preferably from 15 to 40 by weight. The detergent surfactant can be nonionic, anionic, ampholytic, zwitterionic, cationic, or a mixture thereof Suitable nonionic surfactants for use in detergent compositions of the present invention are generally disclosed in U.S. 3,929,678 to Laughlin et al., issued December 30, 1975 at column 13, line 14 through column 16, line 6. Classes of nonionic surfactants included are Anionic surfactants suitable in detergent compositions of the present invention are generally disclosed in U.S. A 3,929,678 to Laughlin et al., issued December 30, 1975 at column 23, line 58 through column 29, line 23. Ampholytic surfactants can be broadly described as aliphatic derivatives of secondary or tertiary amines, or aliphatic derivatives of heterocyclic secondary and tertiary amines in which the aliphatic radical can be straight chain or branched and wherein one of the aliphatic substituents contains from 8 to 18 carbon atoms and at least one contains an anionic water solubilizing group, e.g. carboxy, sulfonate, sulfate. See U.S. A 3,929,678 to Laughlin et al., issued December 30, 1975 at column 19, lines 18 35 for examples of ampholytic surfactants. Zwitterionic surfactants can be broadly described as derivatives of secondary and tertiary amines, derivatives of heterocyclic secondary and tertiary amines, or derivatives of quaternary ammonium,quaternary phosphonium or tertiary sulfonium compounds. See U.S. A 3,929,678 to Laughlin et al., issued December 30, 1975 at column 19, line 38 through column 22, line 48 for examples of zwitterionic surfactants. Cationic surfactants can also be included in detergent compositions of the present invention. Suitable cationic surfactants include the quaternary ammonium surfactants having the formula Preferred of the above are the alkyl quaternary ammonium surfactants, especially the mono long chain alkyl surfactants described in the above formula when R⁵ is selected from the same groups as R⁴. The most preferred quaternary ammonium surfactants are the chloride, bromide and methylsulfate C₈ C₁₆ alkyl trimethylammonium salts, C₈ C₁₆ alkyl di hydroxyethyl methylammonium salts, the C₈ C₁₆ alkyl hydroxyethyldimethylammonium salts, and C₈ C₁₆ alkyloxypropyl trimethylammonium salts. Of the above, decyl trimethylammonium methylsulfate, lauryl trimethylammonium chloride, myristyl trimethylammonium bromide and coconut trimethylammonium chloride and methylsulfate are particularly preferred. Other useful cationic surfactants are disclosed in U.S. A 4,259,217 to Murphy, issued March 31, 1981,. Detergent compositions of the present invention can optionally comprise inorganic or organic detergent builders to assist in mineral hardness control. When included, these builders typically comprise up to 60 by weight of the detergent composition. Built liquid formulations preferably comprise from 1 to 25 by weight detergent builder, most preferably from 3 to 20 by weight, while built granular formulations preferably comprise from 5 to 50 by weight detergent builder, most preferably from 10 to 30 by weight.

These aluminosilicates can be crystalline or amorphous in structure and can be naturally occurring aluminosilicates or synthetically derived. A method for producing aluminosilicate ion exchange materials is disclosed in U.S. A 3,985,669 to Krummel, et al. issued October 12, 1976.

Examples of nonphosphorus, inorganic builders are sodium and potassium carbonate, bicarbonate, sesquicarbonate, tetraborate decahydrate, and silicate having a mole ratio of SiO₂ to alkali metal oxide of from 0.5 to 4.0, preferably from 1.0 to 2.4.

Other suitable polycarboxylates are the polyacetal carboxylates disclosed in U.S. A 4,144,226, to Crutchfield et al. issued March 13, 1979, and U.S. A 4,246,495, to Crutchfield et al., issued March 27, 1979. These polyacetal carboxylates can be prepared by bringing together under polymerization conditions an ester of glyoxylic acid and a polymerization initiator. The resulting polyacetal carboxylate ester is then attached to chemically stable end groups to stabilize the polyacetal carboxylate against rapid depolymerization in alkaline solution, converted to the corresponding salt, and added to a surfactant. Laundry detergent compositions of the present invention desirably include a clay soil removal and or anti redeposition agent. These clay soil removal anti redeposition agents are usually included at from t 0.1 to 10 by weight of the composition. In terms of the benefits achieved, preferred detergent compositions can comprise from 0.5 to 5 by weight of these agents. Typically, these preferred compositions comprise from 1 to 3 by weight of these agents. One group of preferred clay soil removal anti redeposition agents are the ethoxylated amines disclosed in European patent application 112,593 to James M. Vander Meer, published July 4, 1984. These ethoxylated amines are selected from the group consisting of Another group of preferred clay soil removal anti redeposition agents are the cationic compounds disclosed in European patent application 111,965 to Young S. Oh and Eugene P. Gosselink, published June 27, 1984. These cationic compounds are selected from the group consisting of Other clay soil removal anti redeposition agents which can be used include the ethoxylated amine polymers disclosed in European patent application 111,984 to Eugene P. Gosselink, published June 27, 1984 the zwitterionic compounds disclosed in European patent application 111,976 to Donn N. Rubingh and Eugene P. Gosselink, published June 27, 1984 the zwitterionic polymers disclosed in European patent application 112,592 to Eugene P. Gosselink, published July 4, 1984 and the amine oxides disclosed in U.S. A 4.548.744, to Daniel S. Connor, published on October 22, 1985, Other optional ingredients which can be included in detergent compositions of the present invention, in their conventional art established levels for use i.e., from 0 to 20 , include solvents, bleaching agents, bleach activators, other soil suspending agents, corrosion inhibitors, dyes, fillers, optical brighteners, germicides, pH adjusting agents monoethanolamine, sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, etc. , enzymes, enzyme stabilizing agents, perfumes, fabric softening components and static control agents. Except for the previously described enrobing of the soil release compound, granular formulations embodying the detergent compositions of the present invention can be formed by conventional techniques, i.e., by slurrying the individual components in water and then atomizing and spray drying the resultant mixture, or by pan or drum granulation of the ingredients. Granular formulations preferably comprise from 10 to 30 detergent surfactant, usually anionic, and most preferably 15 to 25 surfactant. Liquid formulations embodying the detergent compositions can be built or unbuilt. If unbuilt, these compositions conventionally contain approximately 15 to 50 preferably 20 to 35 total surfactant, from 0 to 5 preferably from 0 to 2 of an organic base such as a mono , di , or tri alkanol amine, a neutralization system such as an alkali metal hydroxide and a lower primary alcohol such as ethanol or isopropanol, and approximately 20 to 80 water. Built liquid detergent compositions can be in the form of single phase liquids provided that the builder is solubilized in the mixture at its level of use. Such liquids conventionally contain 10 to 40 preferably 15 to 25 total surfactant, 1 to 25 preferably 3 to 20 builder which can be organic or inorganic, up to 10 of a hydrotrope system, and 20 to 80 water. Built liquid detergents incorporating components that form heterogeneous mixtures or levels of builder that cannot be completely dissolved can also comprise detergent compositions of the present invention. Such liquids conventionally employ viscosity modifiers to produce systems having plastic shear characteristics to maintain stable dispersions and to prevent phase separation or solid settlement. Care should also be taken to avoid exposing the soil release compounds to highly alkaline environments, e.g. those above a pH of about 8.5, during processing of the liquid detergent formulation. A description of some prefered detergent formulations is as follows While the detergent compositions of the present invention are operative within a wide range of wash pHs, they are particularly suitable when formulated to provide a near neutral wash pH, i.e. an initial pH of from about 6.0 to about 8.5 at a concentration of from 0.1 to 2 by weight in water at 20 C. Near neutral wash pH formulations are better for enzyme stability and for preventing stains from setting. The near neutral pH of such formulations is also desirable to insure long term activity for the soil release compounds, especially those having shorter backbones. In such formulations, the product pH is preferably from 7.0 to 8.5, and more preferably from 7.5 to 8.0. Preferred near neutral wash pH detergent formulations are disclosed in European Patent Application 95,205 to J. H. M. Wertz and P. C. E. Goffinet, published November 30, 1983,. These preferred formulations comprise Such compositions also preferably contain from 3 to 15 by weight of an ethoxylated alcohol or ethoxylated alkyl phenol nonionic surfactants as previously defined. Highly preferred compositions of this type also preferably contain from 2 to 10 by weight preferably from 3 to 8 by weight of a water soluble polycarboxylate builder preferably citric acid and minor amounts e.g., less than 20 by weight of neutralizing agents, buffering agents, phase regulants, hydrotropes, enzymes, enzyme stabilizing agents, polyacids, suds regulants, opacifiers, antioxidants, bactericides, dyes, perfumes and brighteners, such as those described in U.S. A 4,285,841 to Barrat et al., issued August 25, 1981. When high levels of certain anionic detergent surfactants are used, the compounds of the present invention may not deposit as well on the fabric during laundering. See U.S. A 4,116,885 to Derstadt et al., issued September 26, 1978, which describes the incompatibility of ethylene terphthalate PEG terephthalate soil release polyesters with certain anionic detergent surfactants. These anionic surfactants include the alkyl sulfates and particularly the alkyl benzene sulfonates. Inclusion of certain detergent builders such sodium tripolyphosphonate, alkali metal carbonates and aluminosilicate ion exchange materials in such anionic detergent formulations further reduces the soil release activity of the compounds. This decreased performance can be offset by inclusion of higher levels of nonionic detergent surfactant, i.e. above 50 by weight of the surfactant system. However, higher levels of nonionic surfactants do not provide as good cleaning as anionic surfactants, especially in granular detergent formulations. Accordingly, inclusion of a small amount e.g. from 0.5 to 2 by weight of the total composition of a cationic detergent surfactant s as previously described can be used to improve the soil release performance of the compounds. Also, soil release performance can be boosted by simply including more of the compounds of the present invention. In testing the soil release performance of the polyester compositions, the following test method was used The washing was conducted in 0.45 g 7 grain hardness water at a temperature of 95 F 35 C for 12 minutes, with subsequent rinsing in 0.45 g 7 grain hardness water at a temperature of 70 F 21.1 C . This desizing step was done twice. The desized fabrics were formed into swatches 28 cm square for the polyester fabrics, 7.6 x 28 cm 3 x 11 in. for the polycotton fabrics . These desized swatches were then preconditioned with a detergent composition containing the above ingredients in conjunction with a solution or dispersion containing 1 to 100 ppm wash concentration of a soil release polyester composition. This preconditioning step was conducted in a 5 pot Automatic Mini Washer AMW . After the AMW pots were filled with 6 liters of water each, the detergent composition, and the solution dispersion of soil release polyester composition, were added to each pot. Test swatches were then added to each of the filled pots. The wash cycle was conducted in 0.45 g 7 grain hardness water at a temperature of 95 F 35 C for 12 minutes. After the wash cycle, there was a 2 minute spin cycle, followed by a 2 minute rinse cycle using 0.45 g 7 grain hardness water at a temperature of 80 F 26.7 C . Union Guardol 76 SAE 30 detergent clean motor oil colored with 0.075 red EGN dye was used to soil these preconditioned swatches. For the preconditioned polyester swatches, 100 10 ⁶ℓ of this soil was placed on 3 separate spots. Similarly, for the preconditioned polycotton swatches, 50 10 ⁶ℓ. of this soil was placed on 3 different spots. The stained swatches were placed on racks and allowed to wick for at least 16 hours. The soiled swatches were then washed in the AMW with the above detergent composition without addition of the soil release polyester composition using the same wash, spin and rinse cycle conditions as in the preconditioning step. After the rinse cycle, the test swatches were dried in a mini dryer. Gardner Whiteness meter readings L, a and b were then determined for each test swatch. Soil release performance in terms of Hunter Whiteness Values W was then calculated according to the following equation The higher the value for W, the better the soil release performance. In summarizing test results, the polyester compositions are identified by 1 the average number of monomer units in the backbone of the polyesters and 2 the number of methyl capped PEGs at the end of the polyester backbone. The following nomenclature is used to identify the monomer units and methyl capped PEGs The soil release performance of a 2.75 T, 1.75 PG, 2 MeE₁₆ polyester composition was tested at different levels.

The results are shown in Table III The soil release performance of ethylene glycol based polyester compositions having different average numbers of terephthalate units in the polyester backbone were tested. In this testing, aqueous dispersions 10 ppm wash concentration were added during the preconditioning step. The results are shown in Table IV.
