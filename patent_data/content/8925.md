# In line apparatus for dissolving a solid in a liquid.

## Abstract
An apparatus for dissolving a solid especially chlorine solids in a liquid has an inlet line 16 to and a return line 20 from its tank 12 in which a tubular and apertured cartridge 74 contains the solids to be dissolved. The tank end portion 34 of the return line is inserted an adjustable depth into the tank 12 allowing adjustment of the water flow across the solid to be dissolved and hence of the rate of dissolution of the latter. The intake line 16 has a connector 48 a tubular part of which extends into the liquid line 22 and has an opening 50 facing upstream, and analogously a connector 52 of the return line 20 has an opening 54 facing downstream. A hand operable valve 56 and a flow meter 58 are connected in line with the tank in the intake line 16 . The tank end portion 58 of the intake line 16 extends downwardly into the tank and is encircled by a vertically movable pipe 70 which can rest on the bot tom of the tank 12 , and the portion 68 has at least one hole below the level of the top of the encircling pipe 70 for vent ing air from the line. To allow convenient recharging of solids to the tank 12 a screwed lid 94 of an orifice 78 to the tank may be arranged to be rotated by the shaft of a tool exerting a couple about an axis transverse both to that of the shaft and of the lid. The arrangement shows readily adjustable and controll able continuously operable dissolution of solids, especially chlorine solids for swimming pools, without the use of an additional power source.
