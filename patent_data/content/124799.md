# Memory access arrangement in a data processing system.

## Abstract
In a data processing system for use in carrying out address translation of a preselected logical address so as to access a sequence of data elements stored in a memory 32 with an interval left between two adjacent ones of the data elements, a request control circuit 40 decides an element number in each cycle with reference to a logical distance determined by the interval. The memory can be accessed in each cycle by a plurality of real addresses which are equal in number to the element number and which are calculated from the logical distance and the preselected logical address. The data processing system further comprises an address transla tion unit 80 , an address generator 50 and an address com bination circuit 100 , and is capable of accessing the memory 32 and carrying out address translation at a high speed.
