# Planar antenna with patch radiators.

## Abstract
A planar antenna includes a first slotted waveguide 12, 52 serving as a power feed unit, and a second slotted waveguide 14, 54 of planar type coupled with the power feed waveguide 12, 52 , for radiating circularly polarized microwaves into space. The second waveguide 12, 52 has a metal plate in which a two dimensional slot array con sisting of a plurality of rows of slots 16 is formed. An insu lative layer 30, 62 is provided on the second waveguide 12, 52 to cover the slot array 16 . A plurality of rows of metal patch radiators 18 are provided on the insulative layer 30, 62 . These patch radiators 18 are electro magnetically coupled with the slots 16 , respectively, in such a manner that each radiator 18 is directly excited by the corresponding slot 16 through the insulative layer 30, 62 , thereby radiating circularly polarized microwaves.
