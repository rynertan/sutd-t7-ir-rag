# Transistor array arrangement.

## Abstract
A transistor array arrangement for providing high density semiconductor logic circuits in double polysilicon technology is described. Semiconductor, for example, FET, logic circuits have four independent but simultaneously ac cessible FET devices which are formed by intersecting sets of polysilicon gate lines 16A, B and 18A, B . The four FET devices 20A, B 34A, B share a common first diffusion, for example a source 14B , surrounded by four logically in dependent second diffusions, for example drains 12A, B, C, D . A three bit decode device is made which includes this array design.
