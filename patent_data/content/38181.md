# Agglutination immunoassays.

## Abstract
In particle agglutination immunoassays for an analyte e.g. an antigen or antibody in a liquid sample e.g. human se rum , interferences arise due to non specific protein protein interactions and the like. These interferences are reduced or overcome by including in the assay mixture a chaotropic or chaotropic like agent, in a carefully controlled amount. Such agents include guanidine, guanidinium hydrochloride or thio cyanate, sodium or ammonium thiocyanate, and urea, sodium chloride and ethylenediamine tetraccetic acid.
