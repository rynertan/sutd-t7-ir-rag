## Description
Non aqueous electrolytes and cells using such electrolytes This invention relates to non aqueous electrolytes and more particularly to the use of such electrolytes in cells having light metal anodes. Anodes of light metal, for example lithium, have a high energy density by virtue of the low atomic weight and high standard potential of the metal. They are thus particularly suitable for use in small cells. However, most light metals react with water, and it is therefore necessary for a non aqueous electrolyte to be used. Such electrolytes generally consist of an ionisable salt dissolved in an organic solvent, which may be a single liquid or a mixture of liquids. any different electrolytes have been proposed.U.S. Patent No. 4 128 691 discloses electrolytes consisting of a mixture of three organic solvents with an alkaline solute. The first solvent must have a dielectric constant greater than 35, the second solvent is a linear polyether with its ether groups in the jd position and the third solvent is chosen to be capable of dissolving large quantities of solute. One example given as a suitable solvent mixture is 60 by volume polypropylene carbonate, 20 by volume dimethoxyethane and 20 by volume dioxolane.Suitable solutes include lithium perchlorate and lithium hexafluorophosphate. U.S. Patent No. 4 048 403 discloses a cell having a lithium anode, a lead oxide cathode and a non aqueous electrolyte. A solution of lithium trifluoromethylsulphonate in a 50 50 volume mixture of dioxolane and dimethyoxyethane is given as an example of a suitable electrolyte. U.S. Patent No. 4 060 675 discloses a cell having a lithium anode, a metal arsenite cathode and a nonaqueous electrolyte. A 1.0 to 1.4 molar solution of lithium perchlorate in a mixture of propylene carbonate and dimethoxyethane is given as an example of a suitable electrolyte. While cells having light metal anodes and containing these electrolytes perform satisfactorily at temperatures above OOC, their performance deteriorates rapidly at lower temeeratures. Some of them are also toxic or explosive. These di sacivantages are overcame., according to the present invention, by the use of an electrolyte which comprises lithium trifluoramethylsulphonate dissolved in a mixture of propylene carbonate and dimethoxyethane. In the electrolyte of the invention, the propylene carbonate preferably comprises at least 50 , and more preferably 60 90 , by weight of the solvent.Most preferably the solvent consists of 70 propylene carbonate and 30 dimethoxyethane. The concentration of lithium trifluoromethylsulphonate LiCF3S03 dissolved in the solvent mixture should be from 0.25 to 1.5 molar, and preferably the solution is from 0.4 to 1.2 molar. Most preferably, the electrolyte is a 1.0 molar solution of LiCF3S03 in a mixture of 70 wt. propylene carbonate and 30 wt. dimethoxyethane. Electrolytes according to the present invention can be used to construct cells that have stable performance over the temperature range from above 500C down to 300C, and are, therefore, especially suitable for use in low temperature environments. The present invention also includes a cell having an electrolyte of the composition set forth above and also comprising a light metal anode, a ca thode and a separator interposed between the anode and the cathode. Light metal anodes that may be employed include consumable anodes made from al ,Th1nium alkali metal, alkaline earth metal or alloys of zttures of alkali or alkaline earth metals w ith each other or with other metals. The term alloy as used herein includes solid solutions, such as lithium magnesium, and intermetallic compounds, such as lithium monoaluminide. Preferred anode materials are lithium, sodium potassium, calcium, magnesium, and alloys thereof. Of these, lithium is the most suitable since it is a ductile metal that can easily be worked and since it possesses the highest energy to weight ratio. Suitable cathode materials include poly carbon fluoride CF , metal oxides, such as V205, W03, MoO3, x Pb 304 and PbO, cobalt oxides, MnO2, copper oxides, metal sulphides, such as CuS, CoS2, In2S3, FeS, Fez2, NiS, metal chromates, such as Ag2CrO4, metal phosphates, such as Ag3P04, and metal sulphates, such as CuSO4, and mixtures of the above. The separator employed should be chemically inert, insoluble in the cell system, and porous enough for the liquid to permeate through it and establish an ion transfer path between the anode and the cathode. We prefer to employ a lithium anode and a manganese dioxide cathode. The invention will now be described in more detail with reference to the accompanying crawing in which the single figure shows a longitudinal section through the cell of the present invention. The cell shown is of the type commonly referred to as a wafer cell. Such cells are used in, for example, watches, calculators, cameras and hearing aids. For these applications, the cell should be as small as possible for the desired power output, and it is for such applications that cells with light metal anodes and non aqueous electrolytes are particularly suitable. The cell shown in the figure has a lithium anode 14 and a manganese dioxide cathode 17, separated by a glass mat separator 16. A stainless steel cathode mix ring 19 surrounds the cathode. The anode, cathode and separator are enclosed by a container comprising a can 13 and a top 11 made of stainless steel. The top is insulated from the can by a polypropylene grommet or collar 12. A nickel screen 15 is placed between the anode and the top to improve contact between them. For a similar reason, a positive current collector disc 18 is located between the cathode and the can. The remaining space in the cell is filled with the electrolyte of the invention not shown . The cell just described is assembled as follows the anode 14 is punched from a sheet of lithium and assembled in the top 11 with the nickel screen 15. A mixture of approximately 40 wt. manganese dioxide and 10 wt. carbon is placed in a pelletizing die and compressed to obtain a handeable cathode pellet 17. The pellet is then placed in the can with the current collector 18 and the cathode mix ring 19. Electrolyte is added to the can containing the cathode and to the separator. The cell is assembled with the grommet 12 between the top and the can and is then sealed by crimping the can against the grommet. Cells constructed as just described having different electrolytes were tested at various temperatures by discharging through a 10 000 ohm load to an end point voltage of 2.4 volts. The results of the tests are shown in the following table Voltage temperature performance of wafer cell s Values are of performance at 22 t C Figures in parentheses are average discharge voltages in volts Cell No. 1 2 3 4 5 6 O.5M 0.5M 1.OM lO.M 1.OM 1.OM LiCF3SO3 LiCF3SO3 LiCF3SO3 LiCF3S03 LiClO4 LiClO4 in in in in in inTemp. 70 PC 100 PC 70 PC 103 PC 70 PC 100 PC o, 30 DME 30 DME 30 DME 22 100 2.83 10D 2.74 100 2.78 100 2 75 100 2.79 100 276 0 93 2.75 80 2.73 98 2.78 81 2.75 94 2.73 89 2.67 18 82 2.62 30 2.58 88 2.63 38 2.57 72 2.62 31 2.51 29 81 2.64 30 2. 58 84 2 .66 34 2.63 24 2.52 0 PC propylene carbonateDME dimethoxyethane It will be seen that Cells Nos. 1 and 3 according to the invention retained at least 80 of their performance down to a temperature of 29 0C, whereas the performance of Cells Nos. 2, 4, 5 and 6 having different electrolytes fell off greatly at temperatures below OOC.
