# Method for the formation of calcium silicate and the resulting structure.

## Abstract
Calcium silicate is formed by a process wherein the viscosity of the calcium silicate produced in an autoclave is lowered by adding an acetate to the reaction constituents prior to the reaction of these constituents to form the calcium silicate crystals. In one embodiment, manganese acetate is added to comprise between approximately 1 and 3 by weight of the solids contents of the reaction constituents. The result is to lower the viscosity of the reaction product and thus to allow a higher solids content in the autoclave than heretofore commonly used. In one embodiment, water is added in line to the reaction products as they are transferred from the autoclave to a holding vessel or from a holding vessel to a storage tank. In a further embodiment, fibrous material is added to the holding vessel prior to the transfer of the reaction product into the holding vessel, thus to reduce the amount of energy required to bring the pressure in the holding vessel up to a selected pressure beneath that of the autoclave.
