## Description
This invention relates to compositions comprised of a polyisocyanate and a fatty polyol selected from a particu lar class of fatty polyols. More particularly, this in vention relates to compositions comprising a polyisocya nate and a fatty polyol which are useful in forming a wide variety of polymeric products having urethane linkages, such as polyurethane elastomers, polyurethane coatings, polyurethane foams, and urethane modified polyisocyanurate foams. Bilyk, et al. reported in the U.S. Patent No. 3,234,249 to Brack discloses that epoxidized fatty alcohols can be reacted with polycarbox ylic acids to form polyhydroxy polyesters that are useful in the preparation of foams, films, elastomers, and plas tics of various degrees of hardness, flexibility, etc., by reacting them with polyisocyanates, anhydrides, dicarbox ylic acids, bisepoxides, melamine formaldehyde resins, or urea formaldehyde resins. Brack points out that esterifi cation takes place not only at the epoxide functionality but also at the primary hydroxyl group such that the re sultant polyols and the urethanes derived therefrom will have large numbers of hydrolyzable ester linkages. This invention relates to compositions which are useful in preparing polymers having urethane linkages comprising at least one organic polyisocyanate compound and at least one fatty polyol of the formula R¹ R² O CH CH O R³ R⁴ O R⁵ wherein R¹ is a monovalent hydrocarbon radical having from 2 to 14 carbon atoms R² and R³ are individually selected from the group of hydrogen, hydroxyl substituted alkyl radicals, hydroxyl substituted alkoxyalkyl radicals and hydroxyl substituted poly oxyalkylene radicals, provided that each radical contains from 2 to 32 carbon atoms and from 1 to 9 hydroxyl substituents and, provided further, that at least one of R² and R³ is other than hydrogen R⁴ is a divalent hydrocarbon radical having from 4 to 14 carbon atoms provided that the sum of the carbon atoms in R¹ and R⁴ must be from 10 to 24 and R⁵ is selected from the group of hydrogen, hydroxyl substituted alkyl radicals, hydroxyl substituted alkoxy alkyl radicals, hydroxyl substituted poly oxyalkylene radicals, provided that each hydroxyl substituted radical contains from 2 to 32 carbon atoms and from 1 to 9 hydroxyl substituents, and acyl radicals having the struc tural formula OC R⁶ R⁷ O CH CH O R⁸ R⁹ wherein R⁶ is a divalent hydrocarbon radical having from 3 to 13 carbon atoms R⁷ and R⁸ are individually selected from the group of hydrogen, hydroxyl substituted alkyl radicals, hydroxyl substituted alkoxyalkyl radicals and hydroxyl substituted poly oxyalkylene radicals, provided that each radical contains from 2 to 32 carbon atoms and from 1 to 9 hy droxyl substituents and, provided further, that at least one of R⁷ and R⁸ is other than hydrogen and R⁹ is a monovalent hydrocarbon radical having from 2 to 14 carbon atoms provided that the sum of the carbon atoms in R⁶ and R⁹ must be from 9 to 23. It has been found that these compositions yield a variety of polyurethane materials that have a variety of valuable properties. Particularly preferred compositions are those which are substantially salt free. The above structural formula of the fatty polyols contained in the urethane forming mixtures of this inven tion encompasses a wide variety of fatty polyols. The preferred fatty polyols are derived from C₁₆ C₂₂ fatty alcohols, especially those having a high proportion of oleyl alcohol, which have been epoxidized and subse quently ring opened with a diol or a triol such as ethyl ene glycol or trimethylolpropane, i.e. a fatty polyol wherein R¹ is a straight chain alkyl group having 8 carbon atoms, one of R² and R³ is hydrogen and one is the residue of ethylene glycol CH₂CH₂OH or trimethylolpropane CH₂C CH₂OH ₂CH₂CH₃ , R⁴ is a straight chain alkylene radical having 8 carbon atoms, and R⁵ is hydrogen. The preferred monovalent hydrocarbon radicals for R¹ and R⁹ are straight chain alkyl and alkenyl radicals. The pre ferred divalent hydrocarbon radicals for R⁴ and R⁶ are straight chain alkylene and alkenylene radicals. By selecting among the various available naturally occurring and synthetic fatty alcohols, it is possible to obtain, by the processes described hereinafter, fatty polyols having the above structure which are useful in the present inven tion. The fatty polyols useful in this invention can be ob tained by epoxidizing unsaturated C₁₂ C₂₆ fatty alcohols or unsaturated C₁₂ C₂₆ fatty alcohol esters of C₁₂ C₂₆ unsaturated fatty acids which are then reacted with poly functional hydroxy compounds containing from 2 to 10 OH groups, with opening of the epoxide rings. If desired, this reaction product is subsequently reacted with an alkylene oxide. The opening of the epoxide ring of the epoxidized fatty alcohols is generally catalyzed with a strong acid or base which is subsequently neutralized to form a salt, prior to reaction with an organic polyisocyanate. It has been found that the salt from the neutralization of the ring opening catalyst may catalyze the reaction of the fatty polyol with a polyisocyanate to an unknown degree. Thus, salt containing fatty polyols have unpredictable reaction rates with polyisocyanates. It is therefore preferable to remove substantially all of the salt from the fatty polyol to produce substantially salt free fatty polyol, which can be reacted with a polyisocyanate in the presence of a measured amount of a known catalyst which will predictably catalyze the reaction. The fatty polyols useful in this invention are chem ical compounds derived predominantly from renewable raw materials. They are derived from triglycerides, i.e. fatty oils, of vegetable, animal or marine animal origin or from the free fatty acids e.g. tall oil fatty acids. It is known that triglycerides can be reacted, for example, to form methyl esters which can be catalytically reduced to alcohols of the type known as fatty alcohols. Fatty alcohols are understood to be primary monofunctional alcohols which are derived from fatty acid derivatives. Fatty alcohols obtainable on an industrial scale are not pure chemical substances, but are mixtures of alcohols of different chain lengths which contain between 0 and 3 double bonds. The composition of the fatty alcohol mix tures depends upon the nature of the triglyceride from which they have been obtained. However, it is possible to enrich individual fatty alcohols in the mixtures by ex traction, fractional crystallization, or distillation, or to produce fatty alcohols from fatty acid fractions which have already been pretreated in this way. When used herein, the term fatty alcohol means one or a mixture of two or more unsaturated alcohols having the structural formula R¹ HC CH R⁴ O H wherein, R¹ and R⁴ are as previously defined, often in ad mixture with at least one saturated alcohol. The most common unsaturated constituents of fatty alcohols are C₁₆ palmitoleyl alcohol C₁₈ oleyl alcohol, elaidyl alcohol, linoleyl alcohol, linolenyl alcohol C₂₀ gadoleyl alcohol, arachidonic alcohol C₂₂ erucic alcohol, brassidyl alcohol Fatty alcohols containing one or more of these con stituents in large or predominant quantities can be epoxi dized by known methods, for example, using peracids, such as peracetic acid. The epoxidation of monounsaturated fatty alcohols may be carried out with high conversions, for example of from 80 to 100 mole percent. In the case of polyunsaturated alcohols, it is only the first double bond which is quantitatively epoxidized. The epoxidation of other double bonds requires severe reaction conditions. Epoxidized fatty alcohols containing from 30 to 100 mole percent of epoxide groups and preferably from 70 to 95 mole percent of epoxide groups, based on the double bonds originally present, are used for the production of the fatty polyols useful in this invention. Epoxidized fatty alcohols based on fatty alcohols having iodine num bers of from 20 to 170 can be used herein. Suitable epox idized fatty alcohols are derived, for example, from the following fatty alcohols Where the starting material used is a fatty alcohol having an iodine number of from 50 to 55, an epoxide num ber of from 2.5 to 2.7 by weight of epoxide oxygen is attained after epoxidation. Fatty alcohols having iodine numbers of from 110 to 130 can be epoxidized up to an epoxide number of approxi mately 5 by weight of epoxide oxygen, leaving a residual iodine number of from 2 to 30. The epoxidized fatty alcohols or fatty esters are subjected to a catalytic ring opening reaction with at least one polyfunctional hydroxy compound having the structural formula R² OH or R³ OH, wherein R² and R³ are as defined previously, with the exception that they may not be hydrogen. Suitable polyfunctional hydroxy com pounds include ethylene glycol and trimethylolpropane. Because a fatty polyol as defined above, is also a polyfunctional hydroxy compound , either of R² or R³ and either of R⁷ and R⁸ may be a hydroxyl substituted alkoxy alkyl radical which is also the residue of a fatty polyol as defined above. For example, any of the hydroxyl groups of 9 10 2 hydroxyethyl 10 9 hydroxyoctadecanol, a fatty polyol as defined above, can ring open the epoxide group of epoxidized oleyl alcohol to prepare a fatty poly ol wherein R² or R³ is the residue of 9 10 2 hydroxy ethyl 10 9 hydroxyoctadecanol. For acid catalyzed ring opening, it is preferred initially to introduce the polyfunctional hydroxy compo nent and catalytic quantities of an acid, for example sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, p toluenesulfonic acid or acid ion exchangers, into the reaction vessel and then to add the epoxidized fatty alcohol in portions at tempera tures in the range of from about 50 to about 130 C and preferably at temperatures in the range of from about 70 to about 100 C. The course of the reaction may be followed by gas chromatography or even by titration of the residual epox ide oxygen. The epoxidized fatty alcohol is quantitative ly reacted after reaction times of from about 2 to about 6 hours and preferably of from about 3 to about 5 hours, de pending on the size of the batch and the addition rate. At the end of the reaction, the acid catalyst can be neu tralized by suitable bases. Readily volatile constitu ents, such as for example, unreacted polyfunctional hydroxy compounds or even saturated or unsaturated non epoxidized fatty alcohols, can be distilled off Acid catalysis is preferred for use in the above pro cess wherein epoxidized fatty alcohols are reacted with polyfunctional aliphatic alcohols. Other variants of the process can also be used for carrying out the acid catalyzed ring opening reaction. Thus, all the starting materials can be simultaneously introduced into the reac tion vessel or, alternatively, either the polyfunctional hydroxy component or the epoxidized fatty alcohol can be added incrementally. The preferred method of obtaining the fatty polyols of this invention wherein R⁵ is an acyl group, as defined above, is to esterify an unsaturated fatty alcohol with an unsaturated fatty acid, then epoxidize the unsaturation in the resulting ester and ring open with the desired poly functional hydroxy compound selected from the group of R², R³, R⁷ and R⁸. The product of this procedure will produce a fatty polyol wherein R² and R³ will be the same as R⁷ and R⁸, but not necessarily respectively. The fatty polyols useful in this invention wherein R², R³, R⁷ or R⁸ is an hydroxyl substituted alkoxylalkyl radical or an hydroxyl substituted poly oxyalkylene radi cal are obtained by reacting the ring opened fatty polyols with alkylene oxides. It is possible to react the fatty polyols useful in this invention with alkylene oxides such as ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, glycidyl ethers and the like to modify water solubility and viscosity and to provide greater flexibility in the polyurethane product. The other necessary component of the compositions of this invention is at least one organic polyisocyanate com pound. Suitable organic polyisocyanates include ethylene diisocyanate, trimethylene diisocyanate, hexamethylene diisocyanate, propylene 1,2 diisocyanate, ethylidene diisocyanate, cyclopentylene 1,3 diisocyanate, the 1,2 , 1,3 and 1,4 cyclohexylene diisocyanates, the 1,3 and 1,4 phenylene diisocyanates, polymethylene polyphenylene isocyanates, the 2,4 and 2,6 tolylene diisocyanates, the 1,3 and 1,4 xylylene diisocyanates, bis 4 isocyanato phenyl methane, 4,4 diphenyl propane diisocyanates, bis 2 isocyanatoethyl carbonate, 1,8 diisocyanato p men thane, 1 methyl 2,4 diisocyanato cyclohexane, the chloro phenylene diisocyanates, naphthalene 1,5 diisocyanate triphenylmethane 4,4 ,4 triisocyanate, isopropylbenzene alpha 4 diisocyanate, 5,6 bicyclo 2.2.1 hept 2 ene diiso cyanate, 5,6 diisocyanatobutylbicyclo 2.2.1 hept 2 ene and similar polyisocyanates. Also of use in the present invention are trimethylene hexamethyl diisocyanate available from VEBA, hepatadecyl C17 diisocyanate, DDI 1410 an aliphatic C 36 diisocya nate available from the Henkel Corporation of Minneapolis, Minnesota and polymethylene polyphenyl isocyanates such as PAPI 135 available from Upjohn. Tolylene diisocyanate available from Allied Chemical, isophorone diisocyanate available from VEBA are particularly useful. When the composition is to be cured to form a coating, polyisocya nate prepolymers, or adducts of organic polyisocyanate compounds, such as Desmodur N, an aliphatic triisocyanate available from Mobay can be used. Desmodur N is more particularly defined as the tri isocyanate adduct of 3 moles of hexamethylene diisocyanate and water having an isocyanate equivalent weight as later defined of 191 grams. Other adducts or prepolymers of the polyisocyanate include Mobay s Z4370 and Mobay s Mondur CB which are the isocyanurate prepolymer of isophorone diisocyanate and the trimethylol propane prepolymer of toluene diisocyanate, respectively. The particular ratio of the polyisocyanate to fatty polyol utilized in forming the urethane forming composi tions of the present invention will depend upon the par ticular use for which the composition is desired. When the urethane forming composition is to be cured to form an elastomer, coating, urethane foam, or adhesive, the ratio is chosen such that each hydroxy functional group on the alcohol will react on a 1 1 stoichiometric basis with the isocyanate funtionality of the polyisocyanate compound. It is quite feasible, however, to form the urethane foams, elastomers, coatings and adhesives using from about 80 to 120 , preferably from about 95 to 105 on a hydroxyl isocyanate equivalent basis of the polyisocyanate to form the urethane product. When the urethane forming composi tion is to be cured to form a urethane modified isocyanurate foam, an excess of polyisocyanate should be used generally ranging from about a 1.5 1 equivalents ratio of isocyanate to fatty polyol up to about a 30 1 ratio. To determine the amount of the polyisocyanate required for a given mixture with a given fatty polyol, the hydroxyl or isocyanate equivalent weight of the respective polyol or polyisocyanate is determined as that weight in grams of the material which contains 1 gram equivalent weight of the respective functional group. More particularly to determine the number of equivalents in a given polyol the hydroxyl value is first determined by known methods and reported in milligrams of potassium hydroxide equivalent to the hydroxyl content of 1 gram of sample. The calculation to determine the hydroxyl equiva lent weight is then given by the following equation Alternatively if the weight percentage of the hydrox yl groups in the polyol is known, the hydroxyl equivalent is determined as follows In similar fashion the isocyanate equivalent may be determined if the weight percent of the isocyanate func tional groups in the polyisocyanate is known. The equa tion is given below where 42 is the molecular weight of an isocyanate functional group and the weight percent NCO is that portion of polyisocyanate made up of isocyanate func tional groups. To form the urethane forming compositions the fatty polyol and the organic polyisocyanate are merely mixed to gether in the proper proportions. When utilized as a coating the compositions are then quickly spread with a knife, blade, brush or spray over the surface of the article to be coated. Where molded articles are desired various techniques such as reaction injection molding may be used. When used to form a urethane modified isocyanurate foam, the compositions of this invention are mixed with a surfactant, a blowing agent and a trimeriza tion catalyst to catalyze the formation of isocyanurate linkages in the polyurethane product. Specific techniques for forming urethane reaction products are hereinafter described in the examples. If desired, various urethane catalysts may be employed to promote the reaction. Examples of such ure thane catalysts include triethylene diamine, morpholine, N ethyl morpholine, dimethyl piperazine, triethylamine, N,N,N ,N tetramethylbutane 1,3 diamine, dibutyltin dilaurate, stannous octoate, stannous laurate, dioctyltin diacetate, lead octoate, stannous oleate, stannous tallate, dibutyltin oxide, and hexabutylditin as well as other art recognized urethane catalysts. Typical levels of the urethane catalyst are from about 0.001 to about 5 by weight of the urethane linking components. Additional polyols may be included with the fatty polyols. Additional polyols are especially desirable in compositions to be used to form elastomers to modify the rigidity of the resulting elastomers. Such polyols may be an alkyl or cycloalkyl polyol, an ester linked polyol, an ether linked polyol, an ether and ester linked polyol or hydroxy functional acrylic copolymers. Specific examples of alkyl and cycloalkyl polyols in clude ethylene glycol, 1,4 butanediol, 2,5 hexanediol, available from Aldrich Chemical, 1,6, hexanediol, avail able from Celanese Chemical, Dimerol a 36 carbon essen tially linear diol available from Henkel Corporation, glycerol, 1,2,6 hexanetriol available from Union Carbide, pentaerythritol, and 1,4 cyclohexanediol. Additional examples of such polyols include Polybd R 45HT, a poly butadiene diol having an approximate molecular weight of 2800 available from Arco and trimethylolpropane available from Celanese. Especially suitable are the alkanediols having from 2 to 6 aliphatic carbon atoms. Also useful are polytetramethylene ether glycols such as Teracol 1000 and Teracol 2000 available from Dupont having molecular weights of 1000 and 2000 g mole, respectively, polyoxy propylene derivatives of propylene glycol such as Pluracol 410 and Pluracol 710 available from BASF Wyandotte and having molecular weights of 425 and 775 g mole, respec tively, polyoxypropylene derivatives of trimethylolpropane such as Pluracol TP 440, available from BASF Wyandotte and having a molecular weight of 425 g mole and polycaprolac tone diols such as Niax PCP 0240, available from Union Carbide with a molecular weight of 2000 g mole. The following examples illustrate the wide variety of uses that can be made of the compositions of the present invention. The fatty polyols useful in the compositions of the present invention are prepared by ring opening epoxidized fatty alcohols or esters. Examples of epoxidized fatty alcohols are described in subsection 1 below. Examples of the fatty polyols useful in this invention are described in subsection 2 below. The use of fatty polyols to form various polyurethane products is described in subsections B E below. The properties of the epoxidized fatty alco hols used in the following examples are shown in Table I. These epoxidized fatty alcohols are prepared by a known method, i.e., by the method described by D. Swern Initially, the hydroxyl group containing compound is introduced, followed by the addition of 0.1 to 0.5 g of sulfuric acid per mole of epoxidized fatty alcohol to be reacted. After heating to 70 100 C, the epoxidized fatty alco hol is added in molten form. The end of the reaction in the case of 1 kg laboratory batches, after 3 hours is determined by gas chromato graphy. The sulfuric acid is neutralized with sodium methylate and unreacted alcohols are dis tilled off The starting materials used and the charac teristics of the polyol containing mixtures thus obtained are listed in Table II. Urethane elastomers from the fatty polyols useful in this invention have excellent compatibility with a wide range of co polyols and polyisocyanates. Without the addition of co polyols they form hard urethane products of useful properties, especially outstanding resistance to water and hydrolytic degradation. When modified by the addition of appropriate short chain and or long chain co polyols they form urethane elastomers with an excellent balance of properties notable among which are hydrolytic stability and elasticity at low temperatures. In reacting the fatty polyol or blended polyols with a polyisocyanate the following standard procedure was used. The polyol or polyol blend was first degassed by heating to 60 80 C with stirring under a vacuum of 0.1 5.0 mmHg for about 1 3 hours. The polyol was then cooled to 20 30 C and a catalyst, typically a tin containing com pound such as dibutyltin dilaurate, was added when neces sary. The reactive polyisocyanate was added with stirring and briefly degassed under vacuum for a period seldom over 10 minutes. During this period the exothermic reaction caused the temperature, and ultimately the viscosity, to rise and the product was quickly poured into prepared molds. Curing was done at 100 110 C for 1 to 16 hours, the time to gel being noted. Cured specimens were aged 5 7 days at 23 C, 50 R.H., before evaluation. The fatty polyols useful in this invention were used in four different formulations a with a diisocyanate but without a co polyol to form hard urethane castings b with a long chain co polyol to form softer urethane elas tomers c with both long and short chain co polyols to obtain segmented cast elastomers and d with polyfunc tional co polyols to obtain reaction injection molding RIM products. In Table III below, Fatty Polyols 1 through 6 were reacted with three different diisocyanates. NCO A is a carbodiimide liquid modification of bis 4 isocyanato phenyl methane available from Upjohn as Isonate 143L. NCO B is 3 isocyanatomethyl 3,5,5 trimethylcyclohexyliso cyanate. NCO C is an 80 20 mixture by weight of the 2,4 and 2,6 isomers of tolylenediisocyanate. The amount of diisocyanate was sufficient to provide a slight equivalent excess of diisocyanate compound. Catalyst A is dibutyltin dilaurate, added in an amount of 0.1 based on the weight of the reactants. The reactivity of the polyols with the diisocyanate is represented in the following table by the symbols S for Slow, M for Moderate, F for Fast, and VF for Very Fast. The following tests were used to obtain the data displayed in Table III below. The purpose of this test is to determine the perma nent effect of hydrolysis on the tensile strength of an elastomer. Tensile specimens were held in a rack in a pressure vessel for 18 hours at 125 C 14 psi steam. The samples were removed, dried 48 hours over desiccant, con ditioned 48 hours at 23 C, 50 R.H. and tested for tensile strength. The tensile strength after testing was computed as a percentage of that before testing and the result designated The purpose of this test is to determine whether structural panels of the plastic to be tested will remain free of distortion after exposure to automotive paint baking ovens. The lower the amount of sag the more likely the panel will survive baking free of distortion. Specimens of the panel 5 x 1 inch by the nominal thickness were clamped in a fixture with 4 inches over hang. After 5 minutes at 23 C the distance between the end of the specimen and the baseline was measured. The fixture and specimens were then placed in an oven at 120 C for 1 hour. After removing from the oven the distance from the end of the specimen to the baseline was again measured. The amount of specimen sag toward the baseline is recorded. Table III shows that representative compositions of this invention can be used to prepare urethanes having useful properties. The fatty polyols useful in this in vention are unusual in that they form urethanes with use ful hardness and strength when reacted as the sole polyol with a diisocyanate without other modifying polyols. Most polyols on the market require modifying co polyols to place them in a useful hardness range. One reason for this is the intermediate molecular weight of the fatty polyols and lack of other polar groups which influence properties. For example, 1,4 butanediol reacted with NCO A gives a reaction product which is very hard but brittle to the point where it is useless. Polyether or polyester glycols in the molecular weight range of 400 2000 are too soft and cheesy when reacted with NCO A. All these poly ols require modifying with their counterparts in hard short chain segment or soft segment long chain polyols to make them useful. Fatty polyols alone with NCO A are near the hard end of the scale but may be softened with ether or ester diols or hardened even further with short chain diols such as 1,4 butanediol or ethylene glycol. Fatty Polyols 1 through 6 were formulated with NCO A and a long chain polytetramethylene ether glycol having a molecular weight of about 2,000 grams mole, designated as copolyol A, available from DuPont as Teracol 2000. The weight percent of the two polyols and the diisocyanate as well as the hydroxyl equivalents of the fatty polyol to the co polyol are shown in Table IV below. The data shown in Table IV below was collected using the tests indicated below. The purpose of this test is to determine the perma nent effect of hydrolysis on the tensile strength of an elastomer. Tensile specimens were immersed in deionized water at 70 C for 24 hours. They were dried 48 hours over desiccant, conditioned 48 hours at 23 C, 50 R.H. and then tested for tensile strength. The tensile strength after testing is computed as a percentage of that before and the result designated In Examples 31 41, Fatty Polyols 1 through 6 were formulated with NCO A, a short chain diol, 1,4 butanediol copolyol B , and several long chain polyols in addition to copolyol A. Copolyol C is similar to copolyol A in that it is a polyoxytetramethylene ether available from DuPont but the molecular weight is about 1,000 grams mole and it is sold as Teracol 1000. Copolyol D is a poly caprolactone diol having a molecular weight of about 2,000 grams mole available from Union Carbide as Niax PCP 0240. The tests used to obtain the data shown in Table V below were the same as those used in Examples 19 30, de scribed in subsection 2, above. The results in Table V above demonstrate that repre sentative compositions of this invention can be used to form urethane elastomers with excellent elasticity and which retain torsional moduli to a relatively low average temperature. In Examples 42 45, Fatty Polyol 1 was formulated with copolyol E, a commercial copolyol used in formulating com mercial RIM products which is a stable dispersion of poly acrylonitrile in a trifunctional polyalkylene oxide avail able from Union Carbide as Niax 31 28. Example 46 was formulated with Fatty Polyol 7. The RIM formulations were made with NCO A, NCO D, which is a modified bis 4 iso cyanatophenyl methane MDI of medium viscosity containing a high percentage of MDI available from Upjohn as Isonate 181 and NCO E, a modified MDI specifically designated for high modulus reaction injection molding formulations available from Upjohn as Isonate 191. The data in Table VI below was collected using the tests used to collect the data for Examples 1 18 described in subsection 1, above. The data in Table VI illustrates that representative compositions of this invention can be used to form reac tion injection molding products with excellent properties. The RIM product of Example 46 possesses a very high degree of hardness, probably due to the higher functionality introduced by ring opening with TMP, and an unexpectedly high split tear strength. The high split tear strength is unexpected because it is the general experience in the art that increasing the crosslink density tends to reduce the tear strength markedly. The fatty polyols can be reacted with a polyisocya nate to form protective polyurethane coatings. These fatty polyols have a variety of advantages in forming polyurethane coatings by reaction with a polyisocyanate curing agent. The need to reduce volatile organic emissions and the increasing cost of solvents has created a demand for high solids and higher solids coatings. This in turn has created a demand for low viscosity non volatile compounds which can chemically react with polyfunctional isocyanate crosslinking agents to give protective coatings. The fatty polyols are just such compounds. They provide high functionality 3 or more reactive hydroxyls for high crosslink density , low viscosity for high sol ids application , low volatility for solids retention during forced drying cycles , good compatibility with other polyols for use as reactive diluents , and good reactivity with polyfunctional isocyanate prepolymers for fast complete cure . In addition, the fatty polyols when used with low viscosity polyfunctional isocyanate crosslinking agents can be air spray applied as high as 100 solids. The fatty polyols contain at least two primary hydroxyls which result in fast reactivity and more complete cure with polyfunctional isocyanate crosslinking agents. Compared to other liquid 100 solids multifunctional polyols which might be used with polyfunctional isocyanate cross linking agents, the fatty polyols 1 6 have no unsatura tion which might detract from color or gloss retention no significant amount of ester linkages which might de tract from chemical resistance only enough ether link ages to improve compatibility but not so much as to create water sensitivity problems no aromatic groups to detract from gloss and color retention low viscosity compared to other high molecular weight aliphatic triols e.g. bis hy droxymethyl octadecanols a high molecular weight and a low vapor pressure to insure solids rentention, high crosslink density, good adhesion, flexibility, and film hardness and water insolubility, therefore, it introduces no water sensitivity into the cured film which results in improved coatings performance. The fatty polyols can be used in coatings by simply mixing the fatty polyol with a polyisocyanate and applying the resulting mixture onto the surface of a substrate to the desired coating thickness. The coating mixture may be applied in any manner which will achieve the desired thickness, e.g. brush, knife, spray, but in most indus trial applications air spraying is preferred. A volatile organic solvent may be added to the coating mixture to reduce the viscosity thereof and facilitate the air spray application to a given substrate, however, it is one of the advantages of the present invention that little, if any, solvent is needed in the coating mixture of the pres ent invention. A catalyst, such as dibutyltin dilaurate, can be added to the coating mixture to catalyze the reaction between the hydroxyl groups of the polyol and the iso cyanate groups of the polyisocyanate and thereby acceler ate the cure of the coating. Other additives such as copolyols, e.g. glycerol or more complex polyols, and pigments, e.g. titanium dioxide, can also be added to vary the properties of the resulting coating. In addition to Fatty Polyols 1 7, described in Table II, an additional Fatty Polyol was tested in urethane coatings. Fatty Polyol 8 is comprised primarily of 9 10 2 hydroxyethoxy 10 9 hydroxyoctadecanyl 9 10 20 hy droxyethoxy 10 9 hydroxystearate having a viscosity of 36.9 poise at 25 C and a hydroxyl equivalent weight of 229.3 g mole and was prepared by epoxidizing oleyl oleate and ring opening the resulting diepoxide with ethylene glycol. A fatty polyol comprised primarily of 9 10 bis hy droxymethyl octadecanol hereinafter C₂₀ Triol which was prepared from oleyl alcohol as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,304,945, was also tested for comparative purposes. The Fatty Polyols and the comparative fatty polyol were reacted with three different polyisocyanate composi tions NCO F a biuret prepolymer of 1,6 hexamethylene diisocyanate available from Mobay as Desmodur N 75 NCO G an isocyanate prepolymer of isophorone diisocyanate available from Thorson as IPDI T 1890 NCO H a urethane prepolymer prepared from toluene diisocyanate and trimethylolpropane available from Mobay as Mondur CB 60. The polyol was mixed with the isocyanate at the indi cated resin solids ratio. Ethoxyethyl acetate was added to the mixture until a 60 solids solution was obtained having the indicated viscosity. This solution was air spray applied to a Bonderite 1000 treated steel panel and allowed to cure at ambient temperature for at least ten 10 days before testing coating properties. The cured coatings exibited the indicated Pencil Hardness to scratch as determined by the procedure of ASTM D 3363 74 and im pact flexibility as determined by ASTM D 2794 74. The coating formulations illustrating an embodiment of this invention and the results of the tests of their properties are shown in Table VII. The comparative formulations and the results of the tests of those formulations are shown in Table VIII. The fatty polyols useful in this invention can be reacted with a polyisocyanate to form urethane foams. These fatty polyols in general yield excellent foams. In particular, the fatty polyols, when used with a co polyol having a high hydroxyl number, yield urethane foams with excellent rigidity and an isotropicity index close to 1.0 which indicates a rigid foam having almost spherical cells. This is a valuable property in rigid urethane foams, especially those contemplated for use as insulating material. When preparing rigid polyurethane foams from a polyol and a diisocyanate, it is generally necessary to use a polyol having a hydroxyl number in the range of 400 500, more preferably 450 500. Because Fatty Polyols 1 6 have hydroxyl numbers below this range, a modifying co polyol is preferably used with these Fatty Polyols such that the polyol mixture will have a hydroxyl number within the ranges noted above. Examples of suitable modifying co polyols include the alkanediols such as ethylene glycol, alkanetriols such as trimethylolpropane and glycerol, polyether diols derived from alkanediols such as the reac tion product of ethylene glycol and alkylene oxides such as ethylene and or propylene oxide and polyether polyols derived from polyols such as the reaction product of gly col or sucrose with alkylene oxides such as ethylene and or propylene oxide. The process of preparing the urethane modified foams generally includes mixing the polyol and isocyanate reac tants in the presence of a urethane forming catalyst and a blowing agent. An example of a suitable urethane forming catalyst is dibutyltin dilaurate. Suitable blowing agents include the lower fluorocarbons such as trichloromono fluoromethane which when included in the reaction mixture will volatilize from the exotherm of the urethane forming reaction to produce a cellular structure in the resulting foam. As indicated above, many of the urethane foams tested exhibited an isotropicity index close to 1.0. The term isotropicity index is defined as the ratio of the com pressive modulus of the foam in direction parallel to the direction of foam rise to the compressive modulus of the foam in a direction perpendicular to the direction of foam rise. In general, the compressive strength of most com mercially available foams is much greater in the direction parallel to the direction of foam rise than the direction perpendicular to the direction of foam rise, such that the isotropicity of most commercial foams is much greater than one. It has been found that the urethane foams produced from the fatty polyols, particularly those having large amounts of saturated fatty alcohols, a polyisocyanate and a conventional surfactant have a high open cell content. While this may be a drawback in foams used for thermal insulation, it has been found that high open cell content is extremely desirable in foams used for acoustical insu lation. Open cell foams also have utility as filters. Apparent Density ASTM D 1622 63. Tumbling Friability ASTM C 421 71. The tumbling test was carried out for 10 min. The percent weight loss was calculated by the following equation Butler Chimney Test A measure of surface flammability flame spread was used to measure the percent weight retention of the foam. The specimen sizes employed were 3 4 x 3 4 x 10 inches, and the specimens were burnt in a chimney. The percent weight retention was cal culated by using the following equation Rate of Burning and Extent of Burning ASTM D 1692 72 Specimens having the sizes of 150 x 50 x 13 mm were burnt in the horizontal position. The spec imen laid on a wire mesh was burnt from one end by using a wing burner for 60 seconds, then the specimen was allowed to burn. Burning rate was calculated by the following equation Smoke Density ASTM D 2843 70 So called XP 2 smoke chamber was employed for this test. All the results did not reach 100 light obscuration therefore, the data were compared by using maximum light obscuration. Compressive Strength ASTM D 1621 73 This test was conducted with 200 lbs. weight, cross speed 0.1 in. min., chart speed 2 in. min. sample size 2 x 2 x 1 inch. Strength in direc tions both parallel to foam rise and perpendicular to foam rise were measured. Dimensional Stability ASTM D 2126 75 This test was conducted in a closed oven at a temperature of 70 C 2 C, 98 RH and for one day, , one week and two weeks respectively. Sample sizes employed were 4 x 4 x 1 inches. The Dimensional stability rating at 70 C for 24 hours was determined by the following criteria A no change B small change, equal to the control C large change D unacceptable deformation N.A not available due to shrunk foams. The following urethane foams were prepared from the Fatty Polyols 1 6 from NCO I, bis isocyanatophenyl methane available from Mobay as Mondur MR, a sucrose based poly ether copolyol Copolyol F available from Dow as Voranol 360, a silicone surfactant Silicone Surfactant available from Dow Corning as DC 193, a blowing agent of trichloro monofluoromethane Blowing Agent , and a urethane catalyst available from Dabco as 8020. In addition, the following foams were prepared using the indicated short chain alkane polyols as the modifying co polyol rather than the sucrose based polyether polyol of Examples 67 81. The blended polyols were prepared to have an average OH number of 500. Urethane modified polyisocyanurate foams are disclos ed in U.S. Patents No. 3,652,872 and No. 3,931,065. Ure thane modified isocyanurate foams are generally prepared by reacting a polyfunctional isocyanate, and a polyol in less than stoichiometric amounts, i.e. an NCO OH equiva lent ratio greater than 1.5, in the presence of a fluoro carbon blowing agent, a trimerization catalyst and a sur factant. The trimerization catalyst catalyzes the trimer ization reaction of NCO groups to form an isocyanurate ring. Other NCO groups in the polyfunctional isocyanate reactant can react with an OH group from polyol reactants to form a urethane moiety which serves to link the iso cyanurate rings and thereby form a urethane modified poly isocyanurate. The blowing agent volatilizes due to the exotherm of the trimerization and urethane forming reac tions and thereby forms a cellular, i.e. foam, product from the polymerizing reactants. It has been found that the urethane foams produced from the fatty polyols, particularly those having large amounts of saturated fatty alcohols, a polyisocyanate and a conventional surfactant have a high open cell content. While this may be a drawback in foams used for thermal insulation, it has been found that high open cell content is extremely desirable in foams used for acoustical insu lation. Open cell foams also have utility as filters. The following urethane modified isocyanurate foams were prepared using the same Co polyol, Silicone Surfac tant and Blowing Agent as in Examples 67 81. NCO J is a polyfunctional polyphenyl isocyanate available from Upjohn as PAPI 135, having an equivalent weight of 133 g. equiv. and an average functionality of about 2.7. A trimeriza tion catalyst, DABCO TMR 2 available from Air Products Co. was also used in the following examples. A premix of a polyol, a surfactant, a trimerization catalyst and a blowing agent was prepared. A polymeric isocyanate was then poured into the premix which was then vigorously stirred for 10 seconds. After the foam rise was completed, the foams obtained were post cured in an oven at about 80 C overnight. Friability data for a urethane modified isocyanurate foam are very important from the standpoint of practical handling and transportation, because most isocyanurate foams have defects in friability. According to the re quirements for transportation in the U.S., the tumbling friability of weight loss should be less than 30 . In general, the literature so far has shown that increased NCO OH ratio leads to increased friability. The data of the control foam, prepared by using CoPolyol F, a conventional sucrose based polyether polyol Voranol 360 from Dow , showed this tendency which can be seen in the following table, Table XII. In contrast unexpectedly and surprisingly, Fatty Polyol 4 showed the reverse tendency. The data in Examples 85 87 teaches that the fatty polyols give better friability of urethane modified isocy anurate foams without the sacrifice of flame retardance, because higher NCO OH ratios result in reduced flamability due to the higher content of isocyanurate linkages in the foam. A series of rigid, filled, urethane modified isocya nurate foams were prepared from the same isocyanate, sur factant, blowing agent and trimerization catalyst as used in Examples 85 87. The fillers used were sucrose Filler 1 , 1 8 chopped glass fiber Filler 2 , 1 8 milled glass fiber Filler 3 , 1 16 milled glass fiber Filler 4 all of the glass fiber materials were silane treated and are available from Owens Corning Fiberglass , a silane treated calcium metasilicate Filler 5 available from Malvern Minerals Co. as Wollastonite and alumina trihydrate Filler 6 available from Great Lakes Minerals Co. For each Example, a premix of 13.7 g of Fatty Polyol 4, 2.0 g of Silicone Surfactant, 4.4 g of Trimerization Catalyst and 40.0 g. of Blowing Agent was prepared, the fillers were added to the premix, and then 200 g. of NCO J was poured into the premix. The mixture was then vigor ously stirred for 25 seconds. After the foam rise was completed, the resulting foams were post cured in an oven at about 80 overnight. To summarize, improvement in friability was found in the use of 1 8 chopped and milled glass fibers. Other fillers did not show an improvement in friability. It is interesting to note that 1 8 chopped glass fibers in an amount of 30 of the total foam weight showed less than 20 weight loss in the tumbling friability test. In contrast, inorganic powders, i.e., alumina trihydrate and Wollastonite showed increased friability with the increased amount of fillers. Some fillers showed better smoke supression effect at over 20 addition of fillers, e.g., 1 8 glass fibers. Sucrose and alumina trihydrate showed a tendency of decreas ing smoke density. The data also shows that increasing the amount of fillers, except sucrose, gave higher weight retention which suggests higher fire endurance or lower combustibil ity. The data show also that the best filler to impart higher fire endurance to the foam is 1 8 glass fibers, both chopped and milled.
