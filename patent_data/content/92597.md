## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a video TELEVISION game unit. More particularly, it relates to a novel video television game unit designed to enjoy layout of pictures which appear on 9 sections to be displayed on CRT screen.2. PRIOR ART In recent years, various video TELEVISION game devices as represented by Invader game have been booming among the public. The devices of this kind are designed to make it possible to display the developed contents of game on a cathode ray tube CRT screen by using microcomputers. They are the devices designed to permit playing game by inserting a coin or the like therein on each occasion of a round of game. The present invention is designed, among such video television game players, to make it possible for each player to bet his holding points obtainable by inserting coins into the unit so as to enjoy a game of laying out pictures. According to the present invention, the picture layout game which had hitherto been played mechanically with a so called slot machine can be electronically carried out on a CRT screen. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a video TELEVISION game unit with which each player can enjoy the game of laying out pictures which are to be displayed on 9 sections provided on a CRT screen. Another object of the present invention is to make it possible to clear as quickly as possible the previous player s holding points displayed on a CRT screen face when the game player is changed for another new player, thereby permitting to increase turnover of players and improve profitability from the use of the unit. These objects are attained by providing a video television game unit designed to permit playing picture layout game on 9 sections which are to be displayed for development on a CRT screen for plural players to bet the individual s own holding points one another and a video television game unit including a counter device designed to allow to divide the points of plural figures displayed on the CRT screen by two figures from the lowest place and count down the divided two figures in order. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig. 1 is a perspective view of the video television game unit showing its whole construction Figs. 2 to 9 are the views to show the contents of one game to be developed and displayed on a CRT screen in order of development Fig. 10 shows the combination of the layout of pictures which specifically appeared on 9 sections, together with the rebate multiples Figs. 11 and 12 show the scenes where three picture layouts are formed up Figs. 13 and 14 show the scenes where the three picture layouts containing Lucky mark are formed up Fig. 15 is a view to show the scene where each player s expectations fell short and no picture layout was formed on any of the 9 sections and Fig. 16 is a view to show the scene in which each one s holding points are indicated in each player s holding point indication column. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Referring to the drawing, in Fig. 1 there is shown a video television game unit for four players. The part 2 is a bet operating section for each player. Each operating section 2 is equipped with a bet instruction button 21, bet position selection buttons 22, 23, and a start button 24 for instructing start of playing game.The element 3 is a CRT for displaying and developing the picture layout game. To explain the procedures for using the present invention unit along with the contents of game, the present device is one to enjoy the picture layout game so designed for each player to insert their coins through the coin inlet 4 and bet the holding points one another to enjoy the picture layout game. Until one player inserts the coin into the coin inlet 4, the CRT screen shows indications of the titles as LUCXY WINNER and INSERT COIN , calling for each player to insert coins. Then, when each player inserts their coins into the inlet 4 at his own position, there appear on the holding point indication column 5 of each player, as in Fig. 3, the holding points according to the number of the charged coins, thus informing each player of his being allowed to bet. When the indication BET NOW appears, each player is allowed to operate the bet position selection buttons 22 and 23 on the right and the left positions to shift the bet cursor as shown in Fig. 4 and bet to the position designated by the bet cursor. Then, each player is to operate the bet instruction button 21 to bet a part of his holding points at the bet position designated by the bet cursor, followed by enjoying the picture combination game developed on the CRT screen. An outline of this game consists in that, when any one unit of picture layout pattern as shown in Fig. 10 is formed up on the 16 bet positions provided for each player by color classification for each player in a manner to enclose the outer circumference of 9 sections 6 so as to correspond to each unit formed by three sections arranged on the vertical, horizontal diagonal lines of 9 sections 6 in this embodiment, the bet area is constituted in the order of A, B, C, and D from the inner circumference toward the outer circumference , the points of the designed multiple are redeemed as winning points to the player who made a bet to the said bet position according to the picture arrangement so formed up, while on the other hand, when the picture layout ended in vein, the bet points of said player are confiscated by the unit. In this manner, the picture layout game is played. As understood from Fig. 10, the combination of this picture layout pattern is incorporated with LUCKY which may be utilized as any desired picture, and further is incorporated with a picture of Cherry which promises redemption of money when any one of such mark appears.As such, the present device serves to increase the interest of the players in the game. By the way, the bet operation of each player is made in such a manner that, as aforedescribed, the bet position selection button 22 or 23 is operated to make the bet cursor 7 developed on the CRT screen, shift said bet cursor 7 to the right or the left turn, and then, by operating said instruction button 4 a part of the holding points of each player is bet to the bet position of his bet area in the next step. Therefore, by making three consecutive operations, it is possible to bet the points three times as much as the points to be bet in a single bet operation which can be optionally set as 1 point, 3 points, 10 points, etc. determined by the program within the unit 1. Also, in case of obviating to bet to the position designated by the cursor, the bet instruction button may not be operated but the bet selection instruction button may be operated, by which it may become possible to refrain from contesting at that position. Ref. Figs. 3 and 4. Needless to say, the holding points of each player are to be deducted by the portion of the bet points. Thus, when each player bets the whole or a part of his holding points at the bet position at which he wants to defy competition out of the 16 bet positions to complete betting, or when at least one of the players makes a bet to at least one bet position, about 2 seconds thereafter, there appears on the CRT screen an indication of the letters BET NOW OR PUSH START , demanding the player to make selection as to whether to continue bet operations further or to start immediately the picture layout play, thus providing a condition of making ready to start the picture layout game. Now, when either player operates the start button 24 on the bet operating section, the indication on the screen is changed as shown in Fig. 6 to show the letters LUCKYWINNER , and simultaneously the pictures on the 9 sections vary respectively at rapid speed accompanied with electronic sound, followed gradually by slowing the speed of variations thereof, with slowing down of the tempo of electronic sound, until finally certain pictures are statically displayed on each of the 9 sectional areas, as shown in Fig. 7. The drum, i.e., each of the 9 sections 6 rotates like the rotary reel of the well known slot machine, and when the rotation comes to be stopped, certain picture appears.To explain this more particularly, the picture displays shown on each of the 9 sections are so contrived that, as may be understood from Fig. 6, as to be gradually specified from the left side row of 9 sections to the right side row, and also from the upper step to the lower step, so as to attract the player s interest. When the pictures to be displayed on the 9 sections have been determined, the screen phase is shifted to illuminate a part of the three frame lines connecting the completed picture layout and the outer frame of the bet position at which the said picture layout was completed, as shown in Fig. 11, indicating the results of the game.Then, the following settlement is started. According to the unit of the present invention, the liquidation procedures are also contrived to attract the player s interest. In other words, when the picture layout play of one round has been over, only a part of the frame lines connecting the sections in which the picture layout was completed and an outer frame of the bet position are illuminated as in Fig. 12. Further, when all the liquidation for each one of picture layout have been completed, the vertical row, horizontal line, and diagonal line connecting the winning bet position with the sections in which the picture layout was completed are illuminated again as shown in Fig. 14 to attract the player s attention. Settlements are to be made in order from the left uppermost bet position corresponding to the bet positions on the vertical row, horizontal line, and diagonal line of 9 sections in anticlockwise direction. Settlements for redemption of the bet points of each player which is at the winning bet position are to be made. To the players who won the game, the results of settlement are indicated as winning points accompanied with electronic sound, as shown in Fig. 8, and finally, the winning points are added onto the holding points of each player and the added holding points are indicated on the holding point indication column. Then, the indication BET NOW flickers again to inform that the next game is feasible. According to the similar procedures hereafter, each player can thus enjoy the picture layout game on his own expectations. To the player who has had his holding points reduced to zero in the course of the game, no point is indicated on the bet cursor even on operation of the selection button 21. Thus, such a player is to be excluded from playing. In case the speculations of all the players proved unsuccessful and the picture layout was not formed up on any position of the 16 bet positions, then the indication becomes as in Fig. 15. Further, in the event of the situation for any player to discontinue playing the game during playing, the player s holding points indicated on the holding point indication column may be cleared to change for a new player. Then, explanations will be made on the counter device which can clear the previous player s holding points as quickly as possible when a necessity arises for changing with other player. The counter device has its features in ameliorating the inconvenience of the conventional method which is to count down the points one by one, requiring a considerable length of time for the operation of clearing the points.It is helpful for eliminating the uneasy feeling of the new player waiting anxious to play game, increasing the customer turnover of the unit, and promoting the profit making rate of the unit. The construction of the device in principle is such that, in clearing the holding points of many figures on the player displayed on CRT screen, said holding points of many figures are divided by two figures from the lowest place, and the divided two figure numbers are counted down in order from the lowest place, so that, when the two figure numbers come to 00, the next two figure numbers are counted down sequentially. To explain the principle of this device, Fig. 16 is a drawing to show that the holding points of three players playing the picture layout game are indicated on the holding point indication column at the four corners of CRT screen. It indicates that the player A has 48,399 points, the player B 3,765 points, and the player C 2,650 points, respectively as holding points, and that the player D is absent, i.e., the position is vacant. Under the condition as above, when the holding points of each player are cleared with the count device, for example, in making explanations in respect to the playerA, his holding points are divided by two figures each in order from the lowest place. Accordingly, in 48,399 points, it means that 99 exists in the place of 1, 83 in the place of 100, and 4 in the highest place of 10,000. Now, on giving a clear signal to the device, the lowest figure group 99 divided into two figures are counted down one by one to come to 00, then the next group 83 are counted down one by one to become 00, and finally the highest group figure 4 in this case one figure only are counted down one by one to become 0 to make the holding point of playerA 0000. Other players holding points also become 0000, and instantly all players holding points are cleared. According to the above method, taking for example the case of the holding points of 38,765, the time required for the clearing operation will become, as follows EMI10.1 The above time corresponds to about 4 of the time of the conventional method which counts down the holding points one by one. Needless to say, the above effect becomes more remarkable as the holding points to be cleared are larger.
