# Controlled floating contactor switch.

## Abstract
A miniaturized switch particularly suitable for electronic keyboard control applications has a pair of contact members providing spaced contacts, a conductive floating contractor disposed in the space between such contacts adapted to engage both of the contacts to close the switch, a resilient sleeve enclosing the contacts and the space therebetween to encircle the contactor, and actuator means to displace the contactor with the sleeve relative to the contacts to effect closing of the switch.
