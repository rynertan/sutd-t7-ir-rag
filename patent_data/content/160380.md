# Cigarette wrapper structure.

## Abstract
The wrapper of a cigarette 10 has an inner layer 15 surrounding the tobacco rod 12 , an outer layer 19 and an intervening corrugated layer 11 which gives stiffness to the wrapper. The corrugations of the layer 11 can be sinusoidal, as shown, or triangular or may form loops such that each corrugation touches the preceding and following corruga tions adjacent the inner and outer layers.
