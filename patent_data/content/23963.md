# Method for preparing a densified rigid poly vinylchloride resin powder composition.

## Abstract
Completely free flow characteristics are provided to a densified rigid poly vinyl chloride resin powder composition as prepared in a high shear mixer at an elevated temperature, by withholding at least a portion of the total filler requirement from the composition during the initial mixing cycle, and thereafter adding the remainder of the filler requirement to the composition after it has been cooled to a temperature of 175 F or less. The total filler requirement of the composition may likewise be added after cooling the blend to 175 F or less. The resulting rigid resin powder composition exhibits the optimum free flow charactenstics required for satisfactory processing in multi screw extruders.
