# A light radiation system.

## Abstract
A light projector for effectively projecting, in order the light energy transmitted through an optical conductor cable within a wide range of space. The light projector is comprised on an optical conductor rod 21 having a light receiving edge surface 21a and a light emitting edge surface 21b and bent so as to create a surface on which the light receiving edge surface and the light emitting edge surface intersect with each other. The light receiving edge surface 21a is formed opposite to the light emitting edge surface of the optical conductor rod 14 at the light source side and a rotating mechanism 22, 23 for turning the optical conductor rod 21 of the light projec tor at the linear portion, following the light receiving edge surface thereof.
