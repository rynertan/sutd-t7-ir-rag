# A vehicle brake actuator and braking system.

## Abstract
A vehicle brake actuator has a piston 23 within a cylinder 22 for urging friction pad assemblies 19, 20 into braking engagement with a brake disc 21. The actuator incorporates a pressure accumulator 3 and an electrical valve 9 operable to supply pressure from the accumuiator to the cylinder in response to the action of a brake pedal or other control means. The actuator may also incorporate a pump 1 for charging the accumulator, together with other equipment such as skid control means. A braking system incorporates one or more of the actuators and means for producing an electrical output in response to displacement of the brake control means for supply to the valve.
