## Description
Title Apparatus for the non contact disintegration of stony objects present in a body by means of sound shockwaves This invention relates to an apparatus for the non contact disintegration of story objects present in a body hereinafter referred to as concrements , in which sound shockwaves generated in a liquid are focussed on to a concrement to be disintegrated. A similar apparatus is known, for example, from German Offenlegungsschrift 2,351,247, which describes an apparatus comprising a semi elliptical reflector. In the first focus of the ellipse, located within the reflector, sound shockwaves can be generated by spark discharge, which shockwaves are focussed by the reflector in the second focus of the ellipse. If this other focus coincides with a concrement to be treated the focussed sound shockwaves lead to disintegration of the concrement. One disadvantage of this prior apparatus is that, in positioning the elliptical reflector, there is no degree of freedom whatsoever.If, for example, as a result of the location of a concrement and or the configuration of ancillary apparatus, it is not possible with a given reflector to cause the second focus to coincide with the concrement, it is necessary to choose another reflector, because, as it is, the distance between the two foci is fixed in an ellipsoidal reflector. It is an object of the present invention to overcome this disadvantage. For this purpose, according to the invention, an apparatus of the kind described is characterized in that, for the focussing, there is provided a positive acoustic lens or lens confi.guration placed in liquid. The invention will be described in more detail hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings of a few embodiments. Fig. 1 illustrates diagranwnatically the basic idea of the present invention Fig. 2 shows diagrammatically a practical embodiment of the invention Fig. 3 shows a variant of Fig. 2 Fig. 4 shows another variant of Fig. 2 and Fig. 5 Shows still another variant. Fig. 1 shows a reflector block 1, which for example may be cylindrical, and in which a reflector cavity is formed, whose inner surface forms a reflector 3 for ultrasound with a parabolic crosssectional configuration parallel to the plane of the page . The reflector cavity may be rotationally symmetrical about the axis 4, or may be parabolic in any cross section parallel to the plane of the page, so that a focal line is formed. The reflector will hereinafter be referred to as a parabolic reflector, which term should be construed as convering both of the above embodiments. The open end of reflector block 1 is contiguous with one end of a cylindrical extension piece 5, which if necessary is provided on the inside with a material which absorbs or diffuses sound waves, and is closed at its other end with a membrane 6.In operation, this membrane can be held in contact with a pattent s skin, if desired using a jelly like or fatty substance. The reflector cavity and the extension piece 5 are filled with a liquid. The reflector may be mounted in the bottom or sidewall of a bath filled with liquid, in which a patient can be placed. In that case it is not necessary to use a membrane, unless the reflector cavity and the extension piece should be filled with a different liquid from the bath. Also, in that case, depending on the configuration selected, the extension piece may be omitted in part or altogether. In operation, ultrasonic sound shockwaves are generated in the focus F of the parabolic reflector. For this purpose, in this example, two electrodes 8,9 are shown, between which a spark discharge can be effected. It is also possible, however, to generate sound shockwaves by other means, for example, with the help of an ultrasonic transducer. The shockwaves generated in focus F, after reflection against the parabolic reflector, form a plane wave front as shown diagrammatically at 10. This plane wave front should be focussed on to the concrementK to be disintegrated. For this purpose, according to the invention, a positive acoustic lens or lens configuration 11 is used, which is placed in the plane wave path, and in the embodiment shown, is disposed in the extension piece 5. The lens is slidable in the direction of axis 4, as indicated by an arrow 12, to permit accurate focussing. The lens should be made of such a material that, at the transitions liquid lens and lens liquid, the reflection losses are minimal.In other words, the lens should preferably have the same acoustic impedance as the liquid. Suitable combinations of lens material and liquid are known from ultrasonic technology. Fig. 2 diagrammatically shows a practical embodiment of the apparatus of Fig. 1. Extension piece 5 is coupled with the reflector block 1 for relative rotation. For this purpose the reflector block is provided on its outside with an annular shoulder 20, against which lies one end of the extension piece 5, which at least at that point is of right cylindrical configuration. The extension piece is further provided with at least one cross bore, through which extends a locking pin 21 into an annular groove 22 in the reflector block, to prevent the extension piece from sliding off the reflector block. The lens is provided at its circumference with screwthread, which cooperates with inner screwthread formed in the extension piece, as shown at 23. Furthermore, the lens is locked from rotation by a pin 24, extending through an opening adjacent to the rim of the lens, and secured in the reflector block, and if necessary a liquid passage 25 is provided in the lens. By turning the extension piece relatively to the reflector block, and hence relatively to the lens, the lens is moved along the axis, and the focus of the lens can be accurately positioned. Naturally, the lens may be mounted in a frame, which is then provided with outer screwthread cooperating with the inner screwthread of the extension piece. If the reflector is secured in the wall of a bath, the extension piece may also be secured in the bath in a suitable manner. As a variant of the embodiment of Fig. 2, the lens may be arranged to be slidable relatively to the extension piece, in which embodiment the extent of movement may be controlled by means of a threaded spindle extending outwards through a bore in the reflector block, which spindle cooperates with screwthread in the bore through the reflector block and is coupled to the lens. Such a variant is shown in Fig. 3, in which the same reference numerals are used as in Fig. 2. The threaded spindle is designated by 30. In another variant, not shown, the extension piece may be provided at the part surrounding the reflector block with inner screwthread, which cooperates with a corresponding screwthread on the reflector block.In that embodiment the lens may be fixedly mounted in the extension piece. Instead of using a reflector and a point source of ultrasonic waves, it is possible to use a flat or curved ultrasound transducer with an associated acoustic lens or lens configuration. Such an embodiment is shown diagrammatically in Fig. 4. A transducer 40 having a relatively large diameter of, for example, 10 to 15 cm generates, after being energized, a shockwave, in this example a plane shockwave, which is focussed onto a concrement K by means of a suitable acoustic lens 41, which is slidable relatively to the transducer according to the arrow 42. The transducer and the lens are housed, for example, in a cylindrical housing 43 filled with liquid. At the end away from the transducer, the housing may again be closed with a membrane 44 that can be held in contact with a patient.This, however, is not strictly necessary if use is made of a bath, as described before. The slidability of the lens may be accomplished in the manner shown in Fig. 3, but also as shown in Fig. 2. In that case the housing should be made of two parts which are rotatable relatively to each other, analogously to the structure shown in Fig. 2. It is noted that the embodiments described hereinbefore may be modified in various ways. Thus, if the extension piece, or the housing Fig. 4 is closed with a membrane, a second membrane may be mounted within the extension piece or housing at some distance from that membrane, while between the membranes there is provided a liquid whose acoustic wave resistance is intermediate that of the liquid present in the remainder of the extension piece and the reflector cavity of in the remainder of the housing, and that of the body to be treated, all this as described in European patent application No. 83 201 075.5, filed by the same applicants on July 19, 1983. Furthermore, the extension piece or the housing may be connected with a coupling member permitting the apparatus to be tilted relatively to the patient, as also described in the above European patent application No. 83 201 075.5. For the sake of completeness, Fig. 5 shows an example of such an apparatus provided with a coupling member. In the embodiment shown in Fig. 5, the extension piece or the housing is provided on the outside, adjacent to the end away from the reflector or the transducer , which end may or may not be closed with a membrane, with a convex annular thickening 50, which cooperates with a concave annular portion 51 of a cylindrical coupling member 52 to form a ball joint permitting movement according to the arrow 53. The coupling member is filled with liquid and closed with a membrane 54 that can be placed in contact with a patient s skin. These and similar modifications are considered to fall within the scope of the present invention.
