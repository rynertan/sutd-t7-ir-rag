# Apparatus for producing carbonated water in relatively small quantities for drinks.

## Abstract
A carbonation method and apparatus is described in which carbonation is achieved by forcing carbon dioxide in gaseous form from an atmosphere thereof downwardly into a body of water to be carbonated. This may be achieved by a vaned rotor rotatable about a horizontal axis or other means. The carbon dioxide atmosphere is preferably maintained at a pressure of about 100 psig 6.8 bars . The degree of carbonation may be varied by varying the time for which the carbonation is carried on. A flavour concentrate supply means, containing various flavours, is pressurized for the supply of the concentrate utiliz ing what would otherwise be waste carbon dioxide gas from the carbonation chamber after completion of the carbonation operation.
