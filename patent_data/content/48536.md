# SINTERED BODY OF LEAD TITANATE AND METHOD OF MANUFACTURING SAME

## Abstract
Powders of lead titanate consisting of acicular, plate like crystalline particles of tetragonal lead titanate which are elongated in the direction of the a axis are manufactured from acicular particles of tetragonal titanium dioxide of anatase type or from titanium dioxide hydrate particles which are mixed with powders of lead oxide or lead containing compounds and the resulting mixture is fired. Alternatively, potassium titanate fibers of the general formu la K₂O. nTiO₂ may be used in place of the titanium compounds. Grain oriented sintered bodies of lead titanate can be manufactured from said powders.
