# Method of producing high density slurry prill explosives in boreholes.

## Abstract
The pneumatic loading of essentially free flowing slurry bearing ammonium nitrate AN prills, i.e., AN prills which carry or support a water gel or water in oil emulsion, produces a high density explosive consisting of the tightly packed whole and crushed slurry bearing prills. The density of this explosive can be as much as 20 higher than the poured density of the mass of slurry bearing prills.
