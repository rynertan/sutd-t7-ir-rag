# Measuring apparatus using optical interference techniques.

## Abstract
Apparatus for measuring or detecting changes in a variety of physical or chemical parameters comprises an interferometer having a transmission frequency variable over a range of frequencies as a function of changes in the parameter. The transmission frequency is measured by beating with a coherent reference frequency.
