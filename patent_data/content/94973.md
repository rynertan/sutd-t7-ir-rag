# SEMICONDUCTOR PHOTOELECTRIC CONVERTER.

## Abstract
A high speed, high sensitivity semiconductor photoelec tric converter. For that purpose, a field effect transistor, a static induction type of transistor and a static induction thyristor are employed as fundamental elements, and at least parts of the gate regions are exposed on the surface of the substrate.
