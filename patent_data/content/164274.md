# Chrominance signal processing system.

## Abstract
A digital chrominance signal processing system com prises a variable gain amplifier 11 for gain control of a car rier chrominance signal an A D converter 12 for effecting analogue digital conversion of the output of said variable gain amplifier a demodulator 13 for demodulating the out put of said A D converter into two chrominance difference signals R Y, B Y a computing circuit 15 for computing the amplitude of the burst signal of said carrier chrominance signal from said two chrominance signals and a control cir cuit 21 for producing a signal for controlling the gain of said variable gain amplifier by the output of said computing cir cuit, whereby the gain control is prevented from erroneous operation even when the demodulating axis of the de modulator is not in agreement wilh the burst phase.
