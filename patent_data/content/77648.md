# Circuits for regulating the output voltage of a device, for instance a photocell.

## Abstract
A circuit 10 prevents a photo diode 12 from reaching its saturation output voltage, thus ensuring the sensitivity of the photo diode to small changes in radiance at high radiance levels. The circuit 10 utilizes a transistor 30 that is allowed to conduct after the output voltage of the photo diode 12 has reached a predetermined level, thus shunt loading the photo diode and preventing it from reaching its saturation level. A resistor 28 capacitor 32 time constant circuit is provided to prevent the transistor 30 from conducting until the output voltage of the photo diode 12 has reached a predetermined level for a predetermined period of time, thus preventing premature conduction of the transistor 30 in response to transient or spurious voltages.
