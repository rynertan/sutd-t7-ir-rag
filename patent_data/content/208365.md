## Description
The invention relates to a voltage current converter comprising between a first and a second supply terminal a first current source coupled at one end by means of a first transistor arranged as a diode to a first terminal for conveying a reference potential and at the other end by means of a second transistor arranged as a diode to a second terminal, the series arrangement of an input gate for applying a signal voltage and a first resistor for converting the signal voltage into a signal current, being provided between the first and the second terminal further comprising a third and a fourth transistor whose bases are coupled to the first and the second terminal, respectively, the emitters being connected by means of a common second current source to the second supply terminal and the collector of at least one of the third and fourth transistors constituting an output for supplying an output current which is proportional to the signal current, and further comprising a correction circuit for correcting the non linearity in the voltage current conversion due to the non linear emitter resistors of the first and the second transistor, A voltage current converter of this type can be generally used and is particularly suitable for use in a device for measuring the effective value of a signal voltage. A voltage current converter of this type is known from United States Patent 4,268,759. In this converter the first and the second transistor convey the same bias current. Since the first terminal is connected to earth, the second terminal constitutes a virtual earth. The signal voltage which is converted into a signal current across the first resistor is superposed on the bias currents of the first and second transistors. Together with the first and the second transistor, the third and the fourth transistor constitute a so called translinear circuit in which the signal currents of the first and the second transistor are transferred in an amplified manner to the third and the fourth transistor. In this converter the non linear emitter resistors of the first and the second transistor produce a linearity error in the voltage current conversion. In order to correct this error the known converter comprises a correction circuit which is constituted by two transistors whose bases are cross coupled to the transistor and in which one transistor is arranged between the emitter of the first transistor and the first terminal and the other transistor is arranged between the emitter of the second transistor and the second terminal. A drawback of this correction circuit is, however, that at relatively high frequencies of the order of several tens of MHz it has a resonant rise effect causing errors in the voltage current conversion. It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a voltage current converter which has a linear voltage current conversion over a relatively large frequency range. According to the invention a voltage current converter of the type described in the opening paragraph is characterized in that the correction circuit is constituted by a circuit having a first input terminal which is coupled to the first terminal and a second input terminal which is coupled to the second terminal, which has a negative input impedance whose resistance is substantially equal to that of the first resistor. The negative resistance of the correction circuit compensates for the non linearity in the voltage current conversion caused by the non linearity of the emitter resistors of the first and the second transistor. As unlike the circuit in the known converter the correction circuit is not incorporated in the signal path of the first and the second transistor, the correction circuit does not influence the voltage current conversion. The conversion is therefore linear over a large frequency range. An embodiment of a correction circuit may be characterized in that the correction circuit is constituted by a fifth transistor whose collector is coupled to the first terminal and whose emitter is connected to the one end of a second resistor and by means of a third current source to the second supply terminal, and is constituted by a sixth transistor whose collector is coupled to the second terminal and whose emitter is connected to the other end of the second resistor and by means of a fourth current source to the second supply terminal, the base of the fifth transistor being connected to the collector of the sixth transistor and the base of the sixth transistor being connected to the collector of the fifth transistor. According to a further embodiment this correction circuit may be characterized in that the collector of the fifth transistor is connected by means of a seventh transistor arranged as a diode to the first terminal and in that the collector of the sixth transistor is connected to the second terminal by means of an eighth transistor arranged as a diode. The seventh and the eighth transistor correct the non linearity of the correction circuit caused by the non linearity of the emittor resistors of the fifth and the sixth transistor. A further embodiment may be characterized in that the third transistor and the fourth transistor are arranged in cascode with a ninth and a tenth transistor, respectively, whose bases are connected to the bases of the first and the second transistor. By virtue of the cascode arrangements the Early effect of the third and the fourth transistor is reduced. Still a further embodiment is characterized in that the second terminal is coupled to a fifth current source for supplying a current which compensates for the base current of the third and the fourth transistor. Due to this extra current source errors caused in the conversion by the base currents of the third and the fourth transistor are prevented. The invention will now be described in greater detail with reference to the accompanying drawing in which Figure 1 shows an embodiment of a voltage current converter according to the invention. The converter includes a first current source I₁ 2I₀ which is connected to the positive supply terminal 10 and has its output connected to a transistor T₁ arranged as a diode and a transistor T₂ arranged as a diode. The emitter of transistor T₁ is connected to a first terminal 1 and the emitter of transistor T₂ is connected to a second terminal 2. Arranged between these terminals 1 and 2 is the series arrangement of a signal voltage source V which is provided between input terminals 3 and 4 and a first resistor R₁ R. The terminal 1 is also connected to the base of a transistor T₃ and the terminal 2 is connected to the base of a transistor T₄. The emitters of these transistors T₃, T₄ are connected To explain the operation of the circuit arrangement the correction circuit is initially not dealt with and the transistors T₁ and T₂ are assumed to have no influence on the voltage current conversion. In the rest condition a current I₀ flows through the transistors T₁ and T₂ and a current I The voltage current conversion has a non linearity which is caused by the non linear and signal value dependent emitter resistors of the transistors T₁ and T₂. This non linearity is corrected by the correction circuit 5 which has a negative input impedance R between its input terminals 1 and 2. This is evident as follows. If a direct voltage U is applied between the input terminals 1 and 2 of the correction circuit, at which voltage the terminal 2 is positive relative to terminal 1, a current I The correcting effect of the correction circuit 5 will be explained with reference to Figure 2 in which this circuit is diagrammatically represented by a negative resistor R and the total non linear signal dependent emitter resistor of the transistors T₁ and T₂ is represented by a resistor r The signal current i through the transistors T₁ and T₂ is thus independent of the non linear resistance r The influence of the base currents of transistors T₃ and T₄ on the voltage current conversion is reduced by a current source I₅ supplying the base currents for these transistors. The voltage current converter shown in Figure 1 has a linearity error which is less than 1 in the frequency range of 0 30 MHz. The invention is not limited to the embodiment described. Instead of the compensation circuit shown other compensation circuits having a negative input resistance may be alternatively used.
