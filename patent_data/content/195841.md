## Description
Title of the invention Quinolinecarboxylic acid derivatives and process for their preparationDetailed aescription of the invention This invention is concerned with certain novel useful quinolinecarboxylic acid derivatives, with a process for their preparation, and with compositions containing them. This invention provides compounds of the formula It , EMI1.1 wherein R is hydrogen atom or methyl group hydrates and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. The present inventors had developed Norfloxacin which brought today s prosperity of new quinolone antibacterial agent. It has been known that quinolones inhibit the DNA gyrase which controls the topology of DNA. As the results of our investigation of its mode of action, it was found that antibacterial activity is related to the penetrability of the drug into the bacterial cells through porins in bacterial outer membrane. Now, after consideration of the above acknowledgement, the present inventors thought the concept on new antibacterial agent as follows 1 It must inhibit the DNA gyrase. 2 It must have more permeablity into bacterial cells through porins. 3 It must be certainly useful for treatment against Gram positive bacteria, especially Staphylococci. 4 It must have antibacterial activity as well as that of the prior drug against Gram negative bacteria. 5 It must possess good activity against Serratia sp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which showed resistant to the traditionally used antibiotics. 6 It must be also effective against anaerobic bacteria 7 It must possess good oral absorbability in human and animals and stability against metabolic inefficiency. 8 It must have lower toxicity and no side effect upon human and animals. 91 It must be excellent in the productivity. As the compounds satisfied those concepts, the present inventors synthesized the new compounds represented by the formula I and investigated their mechanism of action. The chemical structural feature of the present compounds is that they have fluorine atom on 6 position and chlorine atom on 8position in guinolone skeleton. The present inventors previously developed Norfloxacin having fluorine atom at 6 position of quinolone skeleton. Since Norfloxacin was proved to be clinically very useful for treatment of bacterial infections, quinolonecarboxylic acid analogue has been widely investigated in Japan and abroad.They have brought a remarkable progress to the clinical treatment and are called new quinolones or fluoroquinolones. As a result of our continuous investigation, we found that substituent in 8 position also played a very important part in extention of antibacterial spectrum and increase in activity and absorbability as a drug. Then we prepared various compounds having substituent at 8position and tested their antibacterial activity. The results were analized by means of Quantitative Structure ActivityRelationship and so on. It was found unexpectedly that chlorine atom is the best as substituent at 8 position. The present compound having chlorine atom at 8 position shows stronger activity against, for example, Gram positive and anaerobic bacteria than the analogue having hydrogen or fluorine atom at 8 position. Furthermore, the present compound shows comparable activity against Gram negative bacteria and greater activity againstSerratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which showed resistant to various antibiotics, in comparisox with Ciprofloxacin which possesses the strongest activity againstGram negative bacteria among the compound of the prior art. On the other hand, the present compounds show good stability in a living body and low toxicity in animals. The compounds of the formula I are synthesized by reacting a compound of the formula II , EMI4.1 wherein X is halogen atom and R1 is hydrogen atom or lower alkyl group, with a compound of the formula III ,EMI4.2 wherein R is hydrogen atom or methyl group. The reaction is preferably carried out by heating the two reactants in a solvent such as water, alcohols, acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, hexamethylphosphoric triamide, pyridine, picoline and the like or in absence of the solvent with, if necessary, an acid acceptor such as an inorganic or organic acceptor, e.g., alkali metal carbonate or tert amine, at a temperature of room temperature to 200 C, preferably room temperature to 160 C. It is desirable that a slight excess I to 5 moles of the secondary amine of the formula III is used per mole of the formula 11 and a solvent is used such that the mixture remains homogeneous after dissolution of the compound of the formula It 2 to 10 fold volume of the compound of the formula III . When R1 in the formula 11 is lower alkyl group, the reaction product carboxylic ester is saponified to the corresponding carboxylic acid by the usual manner. The saponification is carried out by treating the compound of formula IV with alkali metal hydroxide solution such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, or mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid in water, aqueous alcohols or acetic acid containing water at a room temperature to boiling point of the used solvent.EMI5.1 The starting compounds of the formula 11 are also new and obtained according to the following route.EMI5.2 EMI6.1 Furthermore, the compounds of the formula I can be converted, if desired, to the pharmaceutically acceptable ammonium salts or carboxylic acid metal salts by treatment with acid or alkali. The acid may be organic or inorganic acids such as, for example, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, acetic acid, methanesulfonic acid, oxalic acid and lactic acid. The carboxylic acid metal salts may be, for example, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, aluminum, cerium, chromium, cobalt, copper, iron, zinc, platinum. and silver salts. The compounds of the formula tI , hydrates and salts thereof may be used as medicines in the conventional form of pharmaceutical preparations, whic ,may be, for example, tablets, capsules, powder, ointments, suppositories, injections or eye drops, suitable ror peroral, parenteral, enteral or local administration.
