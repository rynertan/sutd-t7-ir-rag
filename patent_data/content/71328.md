# Mineral particles bound with silicone elastomeric emulsion.

## Abstract
A uniform mixture consisting essentially of an aqueous silicone elastomeric emulsion and mineral particles having an average particle diameter of greater than 150 mic rometres is described. The emulsion comprises an anionical ly stabilized, hydroxyl endblocked polydiorganosiloxane, colloidal silica, and an alkyl tin salt. The uniform mixture can be applied to building surfaces such as structural foam insulation or wooden walls to provide a protective covering. The cured coating can provide protection from weathering, physical damage, and fire.
