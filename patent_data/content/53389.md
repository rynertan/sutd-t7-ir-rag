# Process for preparing cationic surface active agents.

## Abstract
A process for preparing specific cationic surface active agents in which nitrogen atoms are attached to both ends of a long chain alkylene group or polyoxy alkylene group having at least 6 24 carbon atoms in the molecule, at least one of said nitrogen atoms constitut ing a quaternary ammonium structure, and also at least one hydroxyphenethyl group is bonded to at least one of the two nitrogen atoms. These cationic surface active agents can serve as an accelerator which catalytically promotes changes in a chemical and or physical change process involving a hydrolyzing, deacidizing or extracting operation using an aqueous solution of an alkaline metal hydroxide or an alkaline earth metal hydroxide.
