# Controlling a fuel air ratio of a fuel air mixture for a combustion process.

## Abstract
A method of controlling the fuel air ratio of a fuel air mixture for a combustion process 10 , which produces the flue gases having a combustible content and an oxygen con tent, comprises selecting desired combustible and oxygen contents for the flue gases which correspond to efficient com bustion, simultaneously sensing 24, 26 both actual combus tion and actual oxygen content in the flue gases, and control ling 16 the fuel air ratio in accordance only with the sensed combustible and oxygen content to adjust the ratio until the selected set points are reached. The combustible content can be utilised to regulate the oxygen content set point.
