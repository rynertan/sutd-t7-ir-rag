# Plasma free medium for platelet storage and its production.

## Abstract
A blood platelet concentrate comprises blood platelets in a balanced salt solution containing an anticoagulant and that is substantially free of plasma. Generally the solution contains one or more additives to enhance platelet storage. A blood platelet concentrate may be made by centrifuging blood plasma to obtain a platelet pellet, removing the supernatant plasma and resuspending the pellet in a ba lanced salt solution containing anticoagulant.
