# Radiation sensitive negative resist.

## Abstract
A radiation sensitive negative resist with improved resistance against dry etching and with excellent resolution characteristics is obtained by providing a polymer material which contains vinyl naphthalene or a compound thereof as a polymeric group. A homopolymer of 1 vinylnaphthalene or 2 vinylnaphthalene or a copolymer of 1 or 2 vinylnaphthalene with chloromethyl, chlorostyrene or gly cidyl methacrylate are preferred polymeric materials.
