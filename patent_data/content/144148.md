# PHOTOCURABLE COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING PREPOLYMERS OF TWO CURING TYPES

## Abstract
A photocurable composition which cures rapidly and dry to the touch comprising a meth acrylate functional monomer or prepolymer b a cationically curable monomer or prepolymer c a free radical liberating, carbonyl containing, photoin itiator and d an aromatic halonium salt whose anion is a complex metal halide. The free radical photoinitiator accelerates polymeriza tion of the cationic curable ingredient as well as initiating polymerization of the meth acrylate ingredient. Compositions which further comprise between about 10 and 20 of carboxyl terminated nitrile rubber are especially suited for bonding polybutyleneterephthalate.
