# A process for producing corrosion inhibiting particles.

## Abstract
A process for producing corrosion inhibiting particles comprising binding corrosion inhibiting cations by ion exchange to particles of silica or alumina, which preferably have a BET surface area of at least 500 m² g, to form cation exchanged particles, the cations of which are releaseable by further ion exchange, the BET surface area of the cation exchanged particles being reduced, preferably to less than 150m² g, by subjecting the cation exchanged particles to a heat treatment which comprises heating the particles at a temperature of from 50 to 120 C while maintaining the water content of the particles at more than 15 by weight, followed by heating with removal of water to dry the particles. An embodiment of the invention comprises heating a slurry of the cation exchanged particles followed by drying e.g. spray drying.
