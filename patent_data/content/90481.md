# Transparent antireflection varnish for glass support, and related varnishing method for glass video screens.

## Abstract
The varnish comprises a plasticising resin, a diluent, a matting compound and en epoxy silane compound, this latter having excellent antireflection characteristics and enabling the varnish also to adhere to smooth glass. At the moment of use, a catalyst is added to the varnish, the catalyst being an amino silane compound which causes the epoxy compound to polymerise, so that the varnish layer becomes resistant to abrasion and to chemical agents. The varnish can also be coloured with aniline dyes such as aniline green and aniline yellow. On varnishing, the tube is first degreased, then varnished with several layers, and finally baked at a temperature of between 80 and 150 C for a time sufficient to cause polymerisation of the compound.
