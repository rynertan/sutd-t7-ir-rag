# Wedge type low profile fastener.

## Abstract
A wedge type low profile fastener 1 is disclosed which is adapted to be inserted into aligned apertures in a pair of abutting surfaces. A hex head 11 is provided on the fas tener 1 which is engagable by a tool to rotate the same. Such rotation moves a screw 12 having a pair of spaced wires 17, 18 coupled thereto with a spreader 16 between the wires 17, 18 . As the screw 12 is moved, the wires 17, 18 move along the spreader 16 wedging the spreader 16 between the wires 17, 18 . This moves the wires 17, 18 outwardly against the non accessible surfaces of the aper tures thereby holding the fastener 1 secure in the aper tures until the wedging action is removed. The fastener 1 presents a low profile so that the hex head 11 does not stick out too far while retaining a predetermined grip range for the wires 17, 18 .
