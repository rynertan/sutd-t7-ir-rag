The present invention is further concerned with a substantially pure physiologically active polypeptide having the amino acid sequence described herein, and pharmaceutical compositions containing the physiologically active polypeptide as the effective ingredient.More particularly, the present invention is concerned with a DNA coding for TNF TumorNecrosis Factor , TNF having an amino acid sequence deduced from the base sequence of the DNA, a process for producing TNF from the DNA utilizing recombinant DNA technology, and the use of the product obtained by the process. In the present specification, amino acids and peptides are represented using abbreviations, as indicated below, approved by IUPAC IUB Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature CBN . Incidentally, with respect to amino acids and the like having isomers, those represented by the following abbreviations are of the L configuration unless otherwise specified.

There are known various substances having a capacity for stimulating the reticuloendothelial system, for example, physiologically active substances having antitumor activity which are induced by various Gram positive bacteria and endotoxins. Specifically, Carswell et al discovered that the serum from CD 1 Swiss mice infected with bacillus Calmette Gurin BCG , and after two weeks, followed by intravenous injection of endotoxin has cytotoxic activity against culturedL cells and also discovered a phenomenon that it induces hemorrhagic necrosis of transplanted Meth A sarcoma in the BALB c x C57BL 6 F1 mouse. They gave the name of TNF Tumor Necrosis Factor to the active substance in the serum Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA, Vol. 72 No. 9 , pp. 3666 3670 1975 .Thereafter, Ruff et al reported that the rabbitTNF prepared according to the above mentioned method proposed by Carswell et al was purified about 2,000 fold over the serum J. Immunol., Vol. 125 No. 4 , pp. 1671 1677 1980 .Further, Matthews et al reported that the rabbit TNF was purified about 1,000 fold over the serum Br. J. Cancer,Vol. 42, pp. 416 422 1980 . However, in Ruff et al andMatthews et al, the tumor necrosis effect with respect to the purified TNF is not confirmed in animal experiments. Japanese Patent Application Laid Open SpecificationNo. 57 140725 1982 discloses a process for isolating and purifying a proteinaceous physiologically active substance having antitumor activity, which is induced by administering to a mammal such as mouse, rabbit or guinea pig at least one substance having a capacity for stirilating the reticuloezhaShSi l system and then injecting endotoxin from a Gram negative bacterium into the mammal, or by adding endotoxin from aGram negative bacterium to a tissue culture containing activated macrophages from a mammal.In this JapanesePatent Application Laid Open Specification, there are also disclosed the molecular weight and isoelectric point of the purified proteinaceous physiologically active substance molecular weight, 39,000 5,000 as measured by gel filtration and SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis isoelectric point, pH 3.9 0.3 as measured by isoelectric focusing but not any detailed structure of the proteinaceous physiologically active substance. Meanwhile, Matthews reported that there is obtained a substance having cytotoxic activity against L cells by a process in which BCG is injected into a rabbit and mononuclear phagocytes from various tissues of the rabbit are obtained two weeks after the injection, followed by addition of endotoxin to the cell culture of the mononuclear phagocytes Br. J. Cancer, Vol. 44 3 , pp. 418 424 1981 . However, in his report, the detailed structure of the obtained substance is not disclosed and, further, there is no evidences showing that the obtained substance is identical with TNF found in the serum. The present inventor has made extensive and intensive studies on properties and structure of rabbit TNF and rabbit TNF producing cells. As a result, he obtained cells capable of producing a substance having cytotoxic activity against L cells by administering a substance having a capacity for stimulating the reticuloendothelial system to a rabbit, followed by injection of endotoxin derived from a bacterium into the rabbit, and then obtained such a substance using the L cells. He also affirmed that the molecular weight and immunological properties of the substance having cytotoxic activity against L cells obtained using the above obtained cells are in agreement with those of TNF obtained from rabbit serum.Meanwhile, with the progress of genetic manipulation techniques, it became possible to determine the structure of a protein so long as a DNA coding for the protein is obtained in isolated form. This is so because the structure of the isolated DNA can be determined and, then, the structure of the protein can be deduced from the structure of the DNA. Further, it became possible to produce a protein from a DNA coding for the protein utilizing a microorganism or cell culture. The present inventor applied the above mentioned genetic manipulation techniques to the cells capable of producing a substance having cytotoxic activity against L cells.As a result, he has surprisingly found that a pure DNA coding for a physiologically active polypeptide can be skillfully isolated and the structure of the DNA and that of the physiologically active polypeptide can be determined, and that the physiologically active polypeptide can be obtained in substantially pure form using the DNA. The present invention has been made based on such novel findings. Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a physiologically active polypeptide. It is another object of the present invention to provide a DNA coding for TNF. It is still another object of the present invention to provide a replicable recombinant DNA comprising a DNA coding for TNF and a replicable expression vehicle.

In accordance with degeneracy of genetic code, it is possible to substitute at least one base of the base sequence of a gene by other kind of base without causing the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide produced from the gene to be changed.

In this instance, the amino acid sequence deduced from the base sequence obtained by the above mentioned substitution is identical with the amino acid sequence of the formula I as defined before. In still a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a replicable recombinant DNA which comprises the above mentioned deoxyribonucleic acid according to the present invention and a replicable expression vehicle. The recombinant DNA is capable, in a transformant microorganism or cell culture, of expressing a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of TNF. As the suitable vehicle, there may be mentioned, for example, pTNF lacUV5 1 expression vehicle. Further, the present invention is directed to a microorganism or cell culture transformed with a recombinantDNA capable of expressing a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of TNF. Examples of such microorganism or cell culture include Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, yeasts and higher animal cells. In an even further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for producing the physiologically active polypeptide of the present invention which comprises a ligating the deoxyribonucleic acid of the formula II as defined above to a replicable expression vehicle to obtain a replicable recombinant DNA comprising said deoxyribonucleic acid and said replicable expression vehicle b transforming cells of a microorganism or cell culture with said replicable recombinant DNA to form transformants c selecting said transformants from parent cells of the microorganism or cell culture d incubating said transformants, causing said transformants to express said deoxyribonucleic acid and produce a physhilogically active polypeptide and e isolating said physiologically active polypeptide from the incubated transformants. According to the method of the present invention, the above described polydeoxyribonucleic acid of the present invention is ligated to a replicable expression vehicle as a vector to obtain a replicable recombinant DNA containing the above mentioned polydeoxyribonucleic acid. A microorganism or cell culture is transformed with the thus obtained replicable recombinant DNA to obtain a transformant microorganism or cell culture containing the recombinant DNA.The thus obtained transformant is isolated from the parent microorganism or cell culture by means of a phenotypical trait imparted with the DNA. The thus obtained transformant microorganism or cell culture is grown to effect expression of the genetic information that is encoded on the abovementioned deoxyribonucleic acid, thereby producing a physiologically active polypeptide according to the present invention. Thus, according to the process of the present invention, the physiologically active substance is obtained in substantially pure form. Furthermore, the present invention is directed to a TNF, in mature form1 secreted from host cells as a direct expression product. As a process for obtaining such a mature TNF, there may be mentioned, for example, a process comprising constructing a DNA sequence so as to bond an amino acid sequence, known as a signal peptide, composed of from 15 to 40 amino acids that is derived from a microorganism or higher animal to theN terminus of the amino acid sequence of the mature TNF. Now, an illustrative explanation will be given as to how the amino acid sequence of the present polypeptide and the base sequence of a DNA coding for the present polypeptide have successfully been determined.1. Rabbits are injected with a substance having a capacity for stimulating the reticuloendothelial system.2. The rabbits are then bred for 5 to 15 days and treated with endotoxin derived from Gram negative bacteria to obtain the serum thereof. The serum exhibits cyotoxic activity against L cells and antitumor activity. The substance which exhibits such activities is hereinafter referred to as serum TNF. 3. Rabbits injected with the substance having a capacity for stimulating the reticuloendothelial system are bred for 5 to 15 days and then subjected to tracheotomy to obtain cells from alveolar washings.4. The obtained cells from the alveolar waidngs are cultured in the presence of endotoxin derived from Gram negative bacteria.5. The supernatant of the cell culture exhibits cytotoxic activity against L cells. Such activity is eliminated by an antiserum hereinafter referred to as anti TNF antiboty obtained from a mouse treated with the serum TNF. The supernatant of the cell culture to which endotoxin has not been added exhibits no cytotoxic activity against L cells.6. Radioactive methionine is further added to the cell culture to which endotoxin has been added. The supernatant of the cell culture is analyzed by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The analysis shows that a protein haying a molecular weight of 17500 t 2000 is formed. On the other hand, in the supernatant of the cell culture to which endotoxin has not been added, the formation of such protein is not observed.7. The above mentioned supernatant of the cell culture to which endotoxin has been added is subjected toSDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for fractionation.As a result, the fraction at the position corresponding to the molecular weight of 17500 2000 is found to have a cytotoxic activity against L cells. The result of the analysis of rabbit serum TNF by the SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is in agreement with the above result.8. Cells are collected from the above cell culture and cytoplasmic ribonucleic acid ribonucleic acids is hereinafter referred to as RNA is extracted in the presence of ribonuclease inhibitor.9. From the cytoplasmic RNA, fractions adsorbed onto an oligo dT cellulose column hereinafter referred to as mRNA messenger RNA 1 is obtained. 10. The above obtained mRNA is fractionated by sucrose gradient centrifugation.11. The above fractions are separately injected into oocytes of Xenopus laevis and the cells are cultured in media.The media and the oocytes are evaluated for cytotoxic activity against L cells and the fractions exhibiting cototoxic activity against L cells are collected.12 The cytotoxic activity against L cells which the above oocytes of Xenopus leavis exhibit is eliminated by the anti TNF antibody.13. The fractionated mRNA ic converted into a single stranded DNA complimentary to the mRNA. Then, a double stranded DNA is prepared from the single stranded DNA.An oligomer of deoxycytidylic acid is added to the 3 end of the double stranded DNA and inserted into a vector such as plasmid having one or more phenotypic markers. 14. With the so prepared recombinant, cells of E. coli are transformed, whereby transformants containing the double stranded DNA having a base sequence complementary to the base sequence of the mRNA are obtained.15. Now referring back to the stage 2 mentioned above, in the stage 2 there is obtained a serum TNF in partially purified form. The serum TNF is subjected to SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for further purification. Then the amino acid sequence of the thus highly purified TNF is determined.16. Oligodeoxyribonucleotides are synthesized based upon the amino acid sequence of the highly pur ified serum TNF, and the so obtained oligodeoxyribonucleotides are labelled using a radioactive material.17. The transformants prepared in the stage 14 mentioned above are transferred on a filter and the DNA of each of the thus transferred transformants is hybridized with the labelled oligo DNA obtained in the stage 15 mentioned above. The DNA having the desired genetic material incorporates the labelled oligo DNA and is identified by its radioactivity. Hybridizing colonies are selected.18. A plasmid is isolated from each of the colonies selected in the stage 17 mentioned above, and each plasmid is cleaved with restriction enzymes and analyzed. Strains containing plasmids having same DNA fragments are selected from the colonies.19. Plasmids are isolated from the above obtained strains, and the base sequence of the DNA fragment inserted in the stage 13 mentioned above of each plasmid is determined. It is confirmed that the amino acid sequences deduced from the thus determined base sequence is in agreement with the amino acid sequence of the TNF determined in the stage 15 mentioned above. Thus, the base sequence of the DNA coding for a physiologically active polypeptide and the amino acid sequence of the physiologically active polypeptide are determined.20. The DNA coding for the TNF is inserted into the downstream of the promoter of an appropriate expression vehicle to obtain a recombinant DNA. With the thus obtained recombinant DNA is transformed an appropriate host cell. The transformed host cell is then cultivated on a culture medium1 thereby allowing the host cell of express the desired TNF.21. The TNF activity of the thus obtained TNF is eliminated by the anti TNF antibody. The foregoing discloses the procedures for obtaining theTNF gene and the base sequence of the DNA coding for TNF.However, it should be understood that the foregoing disclosure is not intended to limit the invention and that obvious changes may be made by those skilled in the art without changing the essential characteristics and the basic concept of the invention. As mentioned above, cytoplasmic RNA containing mRNA coding for TNF can be obtained from cells from alveolar washings treated with endotoxin. Further, such cytoplasmicRNA may also be obtained by treating with endotoxin rabbit cells other than cells from alveolar ashings, for example, cells adherent to plastics found in peripheral blood or endotoxin sensitive cells derived from peripheral blood, liver, spleen and the like. In addition, mRNAs may also be obtained by connecting chrarosome DNA to an appropriate vector, followed by insertion into a rnarnian cell. For example, there is well known a recombinant method in whichSV40 is used as the vector and COS as the host cell see, for example, Mantei et al, Nature, Vol. 281, p. 40 1979 andMellon et al, Cell, Vol. 27, p. 279 1981 1. The thus obtained mRNAs are converted into cDNAs. A DNA is selected from the cDNAs by the hybridization method using a probe. The DNA is utilized for the production of the desired polypeptide by recombinant DNA technique. Due to the variable use frequency of a codon genetic code corresponding to each amino acid and for other reasons, a partial or entire portion of the base sequence of the DNA coding for TNF may be substituted by an organochemically synthesized artificial DNA without causing the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide obtained therefrom to be changed. Presumably, the TNF may be intracellularly produced in immature form as a prepeptide or prepropeptide, which may be grown via an intermediate form to a mature TNF in the processing stage. The immature form of TNF may be deduced from the base sequence of the TNF gene. The TNF DNA comprising a DNA encoding the TNF in immature or intermediate form may also be recombined with a natural or artificially synthesized DNA. One application of this technique may be attained by inserting the methionine codon ATG in the 5 end and inserting at least one stop codon selected from TAA, TAG and TGA in the 3 end of the mature or intermediate of immature TNF DNA. Due to the presence of the methionine codon, the mature or intermediate or immature TNF may be produced on the mRNA synthesized with the aid of an appropriate promoter. However, the methionine residue attached to the N terminus of the TNF is cleaved or not cleaved according to the kind of the host cell employed.The purpose of inserting the stop codon is to stop translation of the mRNA transcripted from the TNF DNA at an appropriate position C terminus of polypeptide of the formula I . Another application of this technique may be attained by adding to the DNA a base sequence coding for a highly hydrophobic peptide having an amino acid sequence known as a signal sequence . By this addition, it may become feasible to secrete the TNF to outside the host cell or, in the case of Gram negative bacteria, into the space known as periplasm . When a vector in which a start codon is incorporated is employed, a fused peptide may be produced which consists of the TNF and a peptide attributed to the vector.In this case, the fused peptide may be cleaved chemically or enzymatically. Alternatively, the fused peptide, if the main activity of the TNF is not adversely affected, may be used as it is. The TNF DNA may be connected, at its region upstream of the 5 end, to the gene sequence of a promoter thereby to obtain a TNF DNA promoter sequence which does not hinder its replication and does not cause translation of the resultant RNA to be adversely affected. The thus obtained TNF DNA promoter sequence may be combined with a vector which is replicable in a bacterium or higher organism cell to obtain a recombinant gene. The thus obtained recombinant gene may be used to transform a bacterium or higher organism cell used as a host. The thus obtained transformant may be cultured to effect expression of the TNF gene in order to produce the TNF. When Escherichia coli is used as the above mentioned host, there may be mentioned, as the suitable host, various mutant strains of E. coli K 12, such as HBlOl ATCC 33694 ,C600K ATCC33955 , D1210, RRI ATCC31343 , MC1061, LE392 ATCC33572 , JMl01 ATCC33876 , JM103 Ray Wu et al, Method in Enzymology, Vol. 101, Academic Press, New York andXl776 ATcC31244 . When the E. coli host is employed, there may be mentioned, as the suitable vector, plasmids such as pBR322, pBR325, pBR327, pUC8, pUC9, pMB9 ATOC37019 , pJB8 ATCC37074 and pKC7 ATCC37084 , Aphages such as tgt, B and Charon 4A, and M13 phage. To have TNF produced in the E. coli cell, a promoter selected from the protomers of the E. coli and phage genes may be employed. Examples of the suitable promoter include the genes for lactose degradation enzyme LAC , W5 mutant thereof, penicillinase BLA and tryptophan synthetase TRP , X phage PL promoter and TAC promoter which is a fused promoter of tryptophan synthetase and lactose degradation enzyme. When Bacillus subtilis is used as the host, there may be mentioned, as the suitable host, BD170 strain ATCC33608 ,BRISI strain ATCC33677 and MI112 strain ATCC33712 .

Pick, AcademicPress, N.Y., p 235 1980 or the method described inJ. Immunol, 126, p 235 1981 .The method of evaluation of the cytotoxic activity of the physiologically active substance prepared in the following Examples is explained below. As culture vessels, there are employed 96 well microtiter plates produced by Flow Laboratories, Inc. U.S.A. , and L929 cells are cultured in Eagles minimum essential medium containing 1 v v fetal calf serum and 5 pgvml final concentration of actinomycin D the composition of this medium is described, for example, in Tissue Culture, edited by Junnosuke Nakai et al, Asakura Shoten, Japan 1967 . A sample 0.1 ml serially diluted with the medium and the L929 cell suspension 0.1 ml, 1 x 105 cells are mixed in each well of the plates and the plates are incubated at 370C for 21 hours in an air containing 5 carbon dioxide. At the end of the culture period, 20 jil of a 20 aqueous solution of glutaraldehyde is added to fix the cells.After fixation, the plates are washed with distilled water and allowed to dry, and 0.05 methylene blue 0.1 ml is added to stain the viable cells. The plates are thoroughly washed with distilled water to remove excess dye and allowed to dry. 0.36 N Hydrochloric acid is added to each well to extract the dye from stained cells. Absorbance of each well at 665 nm is measured with Titertek Multiskan produced byFlow Laboratories, Inc., U.S.A. . The absorbance is proportional to the number of viable cells. The cytotoxic activity of the physiologically active substance, unit ml, is defined as the reciprocal dilution of the physiologically active substance that causes 50 cytotoxicity, and can be obtained by plotting the dilution versus the absorbance on a graph. On the other hand, the amount of protein was determined by a method in which Coomassie Brilliant Blue G250 is bonded to protein, according to the teaching of Branford et al seeAnal. Biochem. Vol. 72, pp 248 254 1976 . Example 2 Step 1 Preparation of TNF from rabbit serum Nihon bakuShokushu Japanese White female rabbits, weighing 2.5 to 3 kg, are injected with 50 mg of formalin killed Propionnbacteriurn acnes Coqsrbacterium pNum Wellcome Research Laboratories, England through the ear vein. Eight days later, 100 pg of endotoxin lipopolysaccharide from Escherichia coli 026 B6, produced by Difco Laboratories, U.S.A. was injected again through the ear vein and 2 hours later whole blood was collected from the heart. To the collected blood, heparin sodium was added in an amount of 100 units per 100 ml. The blood was then centrifuged while cooling at 5,000 rpm for 30 minutes to remove blood cells and insoluble solids.As a result, a a plasma 2.4 liters having a serum TNF cytotoxic activity of 3 x 10 units ml was obtained from 40 rabbits. Step 2 Partial purification of TNF from rabbit serum To the plasma 2.4 liters obtained in Step 1, added was 24 g of cellite. The resultant was stirred for one hour, and then subjected to filtration. The filtrate was mixed with 1.2 liters of 0.04 M Tris HCl buffer pH 7.8 , and then applied to a column of DEAE Sepharose CL 6B manufactured and sold by Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Inc. Sweden sufficiently equilibrated with 0.04 M Tris HCl buffer pH 7.8 containing 0.1 M NaCI. The column was washed with 0.04 M Tris HCl buffer, and the adsorbed TNF was eluted with 0.04 M Tris HCl buffer pH 7.2 containing 0.18 M Nail. Fractions exhibiting cytotoxic activities against L cells were concentrated by ultrafiltration. The so obtained concentrate was applied to a column of Sephacryl S 200 manufactured and sold by Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Inc.Sweden sufficiently equilibrated with 5 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 containing 0.15 M NaC1 and gel filtered using the same buffer. The active fractions were concentrated by ultrafiltration, whereby a purified TNF having an activity of 3.5 x 106 units and a specific activity of 18 x 106 units mg protein was obtained. Step 3 Anti TNF antibody The rabbit serum TNF partially purified in Step 2 was mixed with complete Freund s adjuvant 1 1 by volume , and then injected subcutaneously at the back of a 12 week age BALB C male mouse.The above operation was repeated 2 and 4 weeks after the initial injection. One week after the last injection, whole blood was collected. From the collected blood, a serum was obtained. The so obtained serum was added to the culture medium for evaluation of the cytotoxic activity of TNF against L cells in such an amount that it was diluted 500 fold in final concentration. The cytotoxic activity of the rabbit serumTNF against L cells was evaluated in the same manner as described in Example 1. It was found that the rabbit serum TNF exhibited no cytotoxicity against L cells.From the above result, it can be concluded that the mouse serum obtained in this step contained an antibody to the rabbit serum TNF anti TNF antibody .Example 3 Step 1 Preparation of TNF producing cells Nihon hakushokushu Japanese White female rabbits weighing 2.5 to 3.0 Kg were injected intravenously with formalin killed cells of Propioni bacterium acnes Coryne bacterium parvum Welcome Rmarch Laboratories,England . Seven days later, the rabbits were subjected to tracheotany, and the lungs were washed with a physiological saline solution, whereby floating cells were obtained. The so obtained cells were washed with a physiological saline solution.Using as a culture medium RPMI 1640 Flow laboratories Inc., U.S.A. containing 10 v v fetal calf serum Flow laboratories Inc., U.S.A. , the cells were incubated at 370C in air containing 5 carbon dioxide.The cell culture was divided into two groups, and to one of them endotoxin derived from Escherchia coli lipopolysaccharide from Escherchia coli 026 B6, produced by Difco Laboratories, U.S.A. was added at a concentration of 10 pg ml. The same amount of sterile water was added to the other. The supernatant of the cell culture to which endotoxin was added exhibited cytotoxic activity against L cells, and the activity reached the maximum value within seven hcurs after. Such activity was eliminated by the anti TNF antibody, but was not eliminated by the normal mouse serum. On the other hand, the supernatant of the cell culture to which no endotoxin was added exhibited no cytotoxicity against L cells. Step 2 Molecular weight of TNF To the cell culture prepared in Step I to which endotoxin was was added, radioactive L t35SJ methionine 1300 Ci mmol, produced by Amersham International plc, England was further added 1 mCi ml . In accordance with the method of Laemmli see Laetmali, U.K. 1970 , Nature London , Vol. 227, pp 680 685 , the supernatant was analyzed by the SDSpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel concentration was adjusted to 12.5 wt . After the electrophoresis, the gel was treated with ENHANCE commat trade mark of a product of New England Neclear Inc., U.S.A. , and after drying, attached was X ray film Fuji RX, manufactured and sold byFuji Photo Fiom Co., Ltd., Japan , followed by exposure to radiation.In the supernatant of the cell culture cultivated in the presence of endotoxin, it was observed that a substance having a molecular weight of about 17500 was formed. Further, the supernatant of each cell culture prepared in Step 1 was subjected to SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the same manner as described above. Thereafter, the gel was shaken in 2.5 NP 4 trade mark of a surface active agent manufactured and sold by Calbiochem, U.S.A. for one hour, and then in water for two hours. After shaking, each migration lane was separeted by cutting, and cut into strips of 2 mm width in a direction perpendicular to the direction of migration. Each strip was cultured with L cells, and evaluated for cytotoxic activity against L cells. In the lane on which the supernatant of the cell culture containing endotoxin was developed, cytotoxicity against L cells was observed at a position corresponding to the molucular weight of about 17500. No cytotoxicitywas observed at other positions. Step 3 Construction of mRNA The cell culture as prepared in Step 1 was incubated for 2 hours after addition of endotoxin, followed by centrifugation to collect cells. Extraction of cytoplasmic KNA from the collected cells and extraction of mRNA from the cytoplasmicRNA were effected in accordance with the method of Chirgwin et al see Chirgwin, J.M. et al, Biochemistry, Vol. 18, p 294 l979 j. 4 ml of a 4 M guanidine thiocyanate solution was added to 3 x 108 cells, and the mixture was pulverized by means of a homogenizer Model AM 7, manufactured and sold by Nihon Seiki Seisakusho, Japan . The residues were removed by centrifugation, and 2.4 g of cesium chloride was dissolved therein.The mixture was carefully poured into a polyallomer tube in which 2.5 ml of 5.7 M cesium chloride and 0.1 M EDTA solution pH 7.5 had been loaded in advance, and then subjected to ultracentrifugation at 30,000 rpm for 12 hours at 200C using Beckman SW41 Ti rotor manufactured and sold byBeckman Instrument, U.S.A. . After removal of the supernatant, the pellet was dissolved in 1 ml of 10 mM Tris HCl buffer containing 5 mM EDTA and 1 w v SDS . The resulting solution was extracted with a 4 1 by volume mixture of chloroform and 1 butanol. To the aqueous phase, 0.05 volume of 2 M sodium acetate and 2.5 volumes of ethanol were added, and allowed to stand at 20 C for 2 hours or more, thereby to precipitate RNA.The precipitate was collected by centrifugation, dried, and then dissolved in 500 1 of sterile water. As a result, a cytoplasmic RNA solution was obtained. The above obtained RNA solution was heated at 680C for 2 minutes, and thereafter, chilled quickly. 500 1 of 2 fold concentration 10 mM Tris EDTA buffer pH 7.4 containing 1 mM EGTA, 0.1 w v SDS and 0.5 M lithium chlorate was added to the solution, and the mixture was applied to a 200 ag oligo dT cellulose manufactured and sold by Bethesda Research Laboratories, Inc., U.S.A. column, and washed with 10 ml of the same buffer one fold concentration as described above. The material ratained by the column was eluted with 2 ml of an elution buffer containing 10 mM Tris HCl buffer pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA and 0.1 w v SDS.To the eluate, added was 0.05 volume of sodium acetate and 2.5 volumes of ethanol, and the mixture was cooled at 200C to precipitate.The precipitate was collected by centrifugation, and applied to the oligo dT cellulose column, and the fractions adsorbed onto the oligo dT cellulose were collected. 85 pg of mRNA was recovered as determined by the ultraviolet spectrum analysis. Step 4 Size fractionation of mRNA 880 jug of mRNA prepared by the same method as described in Step 3 was dissolved in 250 Fil of water, and the resulting solution was superposed on 10 ml of a 5 25 linear sucrose density gradient. The sucrose density gradient was prepared by means of ISCO 570 gradienter manufactured and sold by ISCO Inc., U.S.A. , using Tris buffer solutions containing 25 mM Tris HCl pH 7.2 , 2 mM ECTA and 1 w v SDS respectively containing 5 sucrose and 25 sucrose. Using Beckman SW41 Ti rotor, ultracentrifugation was effected at 40000 rpm for 12 hours at 40C, and fractions each of 400 e were recovered by means of a fraction recovering apparatus mEnufactured and sold by Beckon Instrunentf U.S.A. , and then ethanol precipitated. The precipitated fractions were centrifuged, and dissolved in sterile water. Step 5 Experiment on translation of mRNA Translation of mRNA using oocytes ofXenopus laevis Hamamatsu biological teaching materials was conducted according to the procedure described in the experimental reports for example, Hiroshi Teraoka, MikioItsuki and Kentaro Tanaka, Protein, Nucleic acid, Enzyme ,Genetic Engineering, extra edition., 1981, p 602 . M nopus laevis was procured from Hamamatsu biological teaching materials.Fractionated mRNA obtained in Step 4 was dissolved in sterile water to have a concentration of I Fg ,ul, and the solution was injected into oocytes in such a small amount as 50 nl per cell. Cells were then cultured for 24 hours in a Barth solution containing 7.5 mM Tris ECl pH 7.6 , 88 mM NaCl, 1 mM potassium chloride, 0.33 mM calcium nitrate, 0.41 mS calcium chloride, 0.82 mM magnesium sulfate, 2.4 mM sodium bicarbonate, 18 U ml penicillin G and 18 Fg ml streptomycin1 which contains 1 mg ml bovine serum albumin. Oocytes were crushed, in the culture liquid, by means of a glass bar.The culture liquid was then centrifuged, and the supernatant was evaluated for the cytotoxic activity against L cells.mRNA which would be translated to give a polypeptide having maximum activity sedimented as 16 S in size. This activity was dissipated by the anti TNF antibody obtained in Step 3 of Example 2, but was not dissipated by the normal mouse serum. Step 6 Preparation of transformants Using 5 pg of the fractionated mRNA obtained in Step 4, a double stranded DNA was prepared in accordance with procedure described in Literature 1 , from page 96. As the reverse transcriptase, use was made of a product of Life Science,Inc., U.S.A. The double stranded DNA was size fractionated by electrophoresis on a 3.5 t polyacrylamide gel, and 330 ng fraction of about 1000 to 2000 bp was obtained. In accordance with the procedure described in Literature 1 , 7 ng of this fraction was extended with deoxyC residues using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase manufactured and sold byBethesda Research Laboratories, Inc., U.S.A. and annealed with 56 ng of plasmid pBR322 which had been digested withPstI and extended with deoxyG residues.The so annealed mixture was inserted into E. coli K 12 strain HB101 ATCC 33694 to transform the strain. As a result, 12000 transformants were obtained. Step 7 Partial amino acid sequence of rabbit TNF Rabbit TNF partially purified in Example 2 activity 5 x 107 units was Subjected to SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for purification as in Step 2. Part of the gel was dyed with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. A band at the position corresponding to the molecular weight of about 17000 was cut out from the gel, and extracted with 1 ammonium bicarbonate. About 180 Xug of TNF was recovered as protein. 150 jig Oe the recovered TNF was dissovled in 75 pa of i ammonium bicorkQnate, followed by addition of 3 ,ug of TPCK trypsin manufactured and sold by Worthington Biochemical,U.S.A. . The mixture was incubated at 370C for 4 hours.The mixture was then fractionated by means of a high speed liquid chromatography column comprising Cosmosil 5C8 manufactured and sold by Nakarai Chemical, Ltd., Japan as the packing material, thereby to obtain fragments digested with trypsin. The highly purified TNF and the trypsin digested fragments thereof were then subjected to desalting by means of a column of Sephadex G 25 manutactured and sold by Pharmacia FineChemicals, Inc., Sweden , and then freezedried. According to the method of R.M. Hewick et al see J. Biol. Chem., Vol. 256, pp 7990 7997, 1981 , the purified TNF and the trypsin digested fragments were each subjected to Edman Degradation from the N terminal. PTH amino acid liberated in each step was analyzed by the customary method by means of a high speed chromatography model SP8100 manufactured and sold by Spectra physics, U.S.A. using Solpacks ODS manufactured and sold byE.I. Du Pont, U.S.A. as the column.As a result, it was found that the TNF had the following N terminal amino acid sequence Ser Ala Ser Arg Ala Leu Ser Asp Lys Pro Leu Ala His Val Val Ala AsnPrGln Va l Glu Gly Gln Leu Gln One of the trypsin digested fragments had the followingN terminal amino acid sequence.Glu Thr Pro Glu Glu Ala Glu Pro Met Ala Step 8 Synthesis of oligodeoxynulcleotide probe Oligodeoxynucleotides complementary to the base sequence of the mRNA which was estimated from the amino acid sequence of rabbit TNF obtained in Step 7 of Example 3 was synthesized according to the improved phosphotriester method which had already been reported by the present inventor in H. Ito et al, Nucleic Acid Res. 10, 1755 1769 1982 .In preparing oligodeoxynucleotides, 128 oligodeoxynucleotides estimated from the amino acid sequence of rabbit TNF were classified into five groups, namely groups of 16, 16, 32, 32 and 32 and were synthesized as mixtures of oligodeoxynuclotides of the respective groups. The obtained oligodeoxynucleotides of the respective groups were deprotected according to the customary method and purified by column chromatography using Sephadex G 50 manufactured and sold byPharmacia Fine Chemicals, Inc., Sweden , electrophoresis on a 20 by weight polyacrylamide gel containing 7 M of urea and column chromatography using DE52 manufactured and sold by Whatman Ltd., U.S.A. . The thus obtained oligodeoxynucleotides of the respective groups were dialyzed against 0.1 mM Tris EDTA buffer solution. Each of the purified oligodeoxynucleotides of the respective groups was labelled using T4 polynucleotide kinase manufactured and sold by Bethesda Research Laboratories,Inc., U.S.A. and t 32P adenosine triphosphate according to the customary method and then purified by column chromatography using DE52 manufactured and sold by Whatman Ltd., U.S.A. .The radioactive material was incorporated into each of oligodeoxynucleotides of the respective groups in an amount of about 3 x 108 cpm ug. The oligoaeoxynycleotioe probes each obtained in the form of a mixture of the respective group were designated as shown in Table 1.

The mRNA of the cells producing TNF which was obtained according to Step 3 of Example 3 was treated with a solution containing 1 M of glyoxal, 10 mM of NaH2P04 and 50 by volume dimethyl sulfoxide at 500C for 60 minutes and then subjected to fractionation using electrophoresis on a 1.1 by weight agarose gel. The fractionated mRNA was transferred on a filter of an electrophoresis type transfer blotting apparatus manufactured and sold by Bio Rad, U.S.A. according to the manual of the maker. Then the mRNA on the filter of the apparatus was treated with a 5 x Denhart solution containing a 5 x SSC solution and 150 Xg ml of denatured salmon spermatozoon at 650C for two hours and, 7 then treated with a 5 x Denhart solution containing 1 x 10 cpm ml of the labelled oligodeoxynucleotides and a 5 x SSC solution at 500C for two hours. The above obtained filter was washed with a 6 x SSC solution successively four times at room temperature, 40 C, 50 C and 600C. An XAR 5 X ray film manufactured and sold by Eastman Kodak Company, U.S.A. was exposed to the radiation from the filter. As a result, it was found that the oligodeoxynucleotides designated byProbe MJ were most strongly hybridized with the mRNA, showing that the oligodeoxynucleotide having a base sequence which was completely complementary to the mRNA was contained in the oligodeoxyribonucleotides designated by Probe MJ. Step 9 Cloning of TNF gene of rabbit In accordance with the procedure described in Literature 2 , page 162, the transformants obtained in Step 6 ofExample 3 were transferred onto a cellulose filter and the DNA of the transformants was hybridized with the labelled oligodeoxynucleotide Probe M selected inStep 8 of Example 3 under the same conditions as in Step 8 of Example 3 colony hybridization .In the just above procedure, 49 colonies which were strongly hybridized with the labelled oligodeoxynucleotides Probe MJ were selected and further fixed onto another nitrocellulose filter. Then, using 49 colonies, further hybridization was carried out to select nine colonies which were more strongly hybridized with the labelled oligodeoxynucleotides Probe MJ . In accordance with the rapid plasmid separating procedure described in Literature 1 , page 6, about 5,ug plasmid was obtained from each of the nine colonies. Each of the obtained plasmids was cleaved using restriction enzymes,PstI, TaqI, RsaI and PvuII each manufactured and sold byBethesda Research Laboratories, Inc., U.S.A. according to the procedure described in the manual of the maker, followed by electrophoresis effected on a 1 by weight agarose gel.Then, fragments obtained by cleavage by the respective restriction enzymes were compared with respect to length thereof. The results suggested that all the nine strains corresponding to the nine colonies had the base sequence of the fragment obtained by cleavage by PvuII and RsaI and consisting of about 50 bp and that eight of the nine strains had the base sequence of the fragment obtained by cleavage by RsaI and consisting of about 200 bp. In other words, the results suggested that the nine strains had the partially common base sequences. The results of analysis by the restriction enzymes are shown in Fig. 1. Seven strains containing plasmids designated in Table 2 below were separately cultivated in 2 ml of LB medium containing 10 pg ml of tetracycline so that the optical density of the solutions showed the values shown in Table 2 below, followed by centrifugation to obtain respective strains. The obtained strains are separately added into 2 ml of physiological saline and disrupted by sonication. The obtained solutions are subjected to centrifugation and the cytotoxic activity against L cells of the obtained supernatants was determined. The results are shown in Table 2 below. As a blank test, the same procedures as mentioned above were repeated using a strain containing plasmid pBR322.The results are also shown in Table 2 below.

Step 10 Determination of base sequence of DNA coding for rabbit TNF E. coli strains containing plasmids pB2 7 and pR 18 were cultivated in one liter of M9 medium described in Literature 3 , page 440 and containing 10 pg ml of tetracycline. Then, in accordance with procedure described in Literature 3 , page 90, each of plasmids was isolated in an amount of about 150 Zg The base sequence of each plasmid was determined according to the Maxam Gilbert chemical procedure described in Maxam et al Method in Enzymology , 55, P 490 1980 ,Academic Press. The thus determined base sequence was found to be in agreement with the partial amino acid sequences determined in Step 7 of Example 3.Thus, the whole sequence of TNF of rabbit was considered to be elucidated. Step 11 In this step, construction of a plasmid was carried out using the recombinant plasmid pR12 to obtain direct expression of TNF in E. coli using lac as a promoter.The procedures are illustratively shown in Fig. 2. First 10 jig of plasmid pR12 was digested with 10 units of ApaI manufactured and sold by Bethesda Research Laboratories,Inc., U.S.A. at 370C for two hours and electrophoresed on a 4 by weight polyacrylamide gel to isolate about 630 bp fragments. About 1,ug of the fragment was isolated from the gel by electroelution. In the same manner as in Step 8 of Example 3, two oligodeoxynucleotides shown in Fig. 2, namely 5 GATCCATGAGCGCTTCTCGGGCC 3 and 5 CGAGAAGCGCTCATG 3 were synthesized. Then, each 5 end of the oligodeoxynucleotides about 100 pmole was phosphorylqted using T4 polynucleotide kinase in accordance with the method described in Literature 3 , page 122.After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was extracted with phenol and then with chloroform. Then the obtained synthetic oligomers were mixed with 0.5tug of the Papal 630 bp fragment and ethanol precipitated. The fragment was ligated with the synthetic oligomers at 40C overnight using 10 units of T4 DNA ligase in accordance with the procedure described in Literature 1 , page 37. After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was ethanol precipitated and digested with 20 units of BamHI at 370C for three hours, followed by electrophoresis effected on a 4 by weight polyacrylamide gel to recover about 670 bp fragment by electroelution. One pg of commercially available plasmid pUC 8 catalog No. 4916, manufactured and sold byP L Biochemicals, Inc., U.S.A. was digested with BamHI and extracted with phenol and then with chloroform, followed by ethanol precipitation to obtain a vector. 0.5 Xg of the obtained vector was ligated with the above obtained fragment having BamHI sites on its both ends and containing about 670 bp coding for TNF using T4 DNA ligase. In accordance with the procedure described in Literature 3 , page 250,E. coli JM103 sold by Bethesda Research Laboratories, Inc.,U.S.A. was transformed using the above obtained vector and cultivated on an agar medium containing 1 mM ofIPTG and 0.004 w v of x gal to obtain about 200 white colonies.Plasmid DNA was prepared from 100 of these transformants and digested with BamHI. As a result, it was found that 15 plasmids contained the intended BamHI fragment about 670 bp . Ih order to exmine the direction of insertion, the 15 plasmfids are digested with EcoRI having only one recognition site on its pUC 8 and PvuII having only one recognition site on its about 670 base pair fragment part and electrophoresed on a 6 by weight polyacrylamide gel. As a result, it was affirmed that 7 plasmids had the intended fragment consisting of about 140 bp and that the direction of transcription of the lac promotor on pUC 8 is in agreement with that 9f the oligodeoxyribonucleotides coding for TNF. DNA sequence analysis showed that these seven plasmids had the same sequence and had the desired nucleotide sequence at the junctions between the lac promoter, synthetic DNA and cDNA. The transformant containing the plasmid is designated asE. coli K 12 strain JM103 pTNF lac l ATCC accession number 39677 . Construction of plasmids was carried out using the recombinant plasmid pR12 in order to obtain direct expression of TNF in E. coli using lac UV5 as a promoter.The precedures are illustratively shown in Fig. 3. First, 10 pg of the plasmid pR12 was digested with 10 units of ApaI manufactured and sold by Bethesda Research Laboratories, Inc, U.S.A. at 370C for two hours and electrophoresed on a 4 by weight polyacrylamide gel to isolate a fragment consisting of about 630 bp. About 1 jug of the fragment was isolated from the gel by electroelution. In the same manner as in Step 8, two oligodeoxynucleotides shown in Fig. 3, namely 5 AATTCATGTCAGCTTCTCGGGCC 3 and 5 CGAGAAGCTGACATG 3 were synthesized. Then, each 5 end of the two oligodeoxynucleotides about 100 pmole was phosphorylated using T4 polynucleotide kinase in accordance with the method described in Literature 3 , page 122.After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was extracted with phenol and then with chloroform. Then the synthetic oligomers were mixed with 0.5 pg of the previously obtained ApaI fragment about 630 bp prepared from the plasmid pR12 and ethanol precipitated. The fragment was ligated with the synthetic oligomers at 40C overnight using 10 units of T4 ligase in accordance with procedure described in Literature 1 , page 37. After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was ethanol precipitated and digested with 20 units of EcoRI at 370C for three hours, followed by electrophoresis effected on a 4 by weight polyacrylamide gel to recover a fragment about 670 bp by electroelution. In accordance with the procedure described in F. Fuller, Gene , 19, pp 42 54 1982 , plasmid pOP95 15 was prepared. One pg of pOP95 15 was digested with EcoRI and extracted with phenol and then with chloroform, followed by ethanol precipitation to obtain a vector. Using T4 DNA ligase, 0.5 lug of the obtained vector was ligated with the fragment about 670 bp obtained by ligating the synthitic oligonucleotide with the oligonucleotide coding for TNF.In accordance with the procedure described in Literature 3 , page 250, E. coli JM103 was transformed using the above obtained vector and cultivated on a medium containing 1 mM of IPTG and 0.004 w v of x gal to obtain about 150 white colonies. Plasmid DNA was prepared from 100 of these colonies and digested with EcoRI. As a result, it was found that 12 plasmids contained the intended EcoRI fragment about 670 bp . In order to examine the direction of insertion, the above 12 plasmids were digested withPvuII and PstI and electrophoresed on a 1.5 by weight agarose gel. As a result, it was affirmed that four plasmids had the desired fragments about 1280 bp and about 2600 bp and that the direction of transcription of the lac W 5 promoter was in agreement with that of the oligodeoxynucleotides coding for TNF. Base sequence analysis showed that these four plasmids had the same sequence and that the lac UV5 promoter, the synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide and cDNA were properly combined each other. The obtained plasmids were designated pTNF 1acUV5 l. Step 12 Purification of TNF produced by E. coli E. coli strains containing plasmids obtained in Step 11 were cultivated on 50 ml of LB medium containing 100 pg ml of ampicillin at 370C overnight Then the strains were transferred to 5 liters of LB medium containing 100 rg mlof amplicillin and further cultivated at 370C for three hours. Isopropylw thiogalactopyranosiee manufactured and sold by Sigma Chemical Company, Inc., U.S.A. was added to it to a final concentration of I mM. Further cultivation was carried out for six hours, followed by cooling. Then strains were collected by centrifugation. In the same manner as described in Step ll, the strains were added into 5 litters of 0.04 M Tris HC1 buffer sulution pH 7.8 and disrupted by sonication to obtain a strain protein solution. The obtained solution had cytotoxic activity against L cells of 6.7 x 107 units liter. The obtained solution was purified in the same manner as in Step 2 of Example 1 to obtain 1.2 x 106 units of TNF. The specific activity of the TNF was 6.8 x 10 units mg. Step 13 Evaluation using transplanted Meth A sarcoma in mouse 5 2 x 10 Meth A sarcoma cells were transplanted intradermally at abdomen of a BALB c mouse and, 7 days later, mice with tumors of 7 to 8 mm in diameter and with no sFont wnes central necrosis were selected for evaluation. A sample 0.2 ml of TNF obtained in Step 12 of Example 12 and diluted with physiological saline solution was injected through the tail vein. The activity of the sample was evaluated after 24 hours according to the following criteria. no change slight hemorrhagic necrosis moderate hemorrhagic necrosis central necrosis extending over approximately 50 of the tumor surface marked hemorrhagic necrosis massive necrosis leaving a small viable rim along the tumor periphery 20 Days after the injection of the sample, observations were made on the involution of tumors and the recovery rate was determined according to the following equation.
