## Abstract
A plurality of optical guide paths 21, 22 are built in a guide path plate 1 . A plurality of optical guide posts 61, 62 are erected on the guide path plate 1 so that each may oppose to one end of the corresponding optical guide path 21,22 . The other end of at least one 21 of the optical guide paths is optically connected to a light projecting portion 3 , and the other end of at least another one 22 of the optical guide paths is optically connected to a light receiving portion 4 . A part 5 to be sensed which is movable is located between the distal ends of the optical guide posts 61, 62 whose base ends are connected to the corresponding optical guide paths 21, 22 . The presence of the part 5 to be sensed is detected in such a way that the part 5 interrupts or transmits light which passes between the distal ends of the optical guide posts 61, 62 .
