## Description
method a nd apparatus for the production of suppository shells The present invention relates to a method allowing to proeduce shells or envelopes for suppositories in a particularly advantageous way as well as an apparatus for carrying out said method. The envelopes or shells for suppositories are consisting of the cell, i.e. the portion having the characteristic shape of an ogive and the volume corresponding to the dosage of pharmaceutical product to be administered, and the bell i.e.that funnel shaped portion through which filling of the cell is effected and then is closed general ly by welding or sometimes by a sealing strip. The shells are produced by joining two continuous tapes of thermoplastic material and making the cells on them by heating and molding or blowing. As a general rule from each tape two continuous rows of oppositely arranged cells are obtained, which are then generally severed at the moment of preparillg the suppositories. These continuous rows of cells are generally produced by high production machines in a specialized plant, then wound into big rolls or lengths, which are then carried to the pharmaceutical industry providing for preparation of the suppositories. It is clear that the shaped cells, also in view of their particular form, take much space and packing, carrying and storing these rolls are a great part of be cost of suppository shells. In order to try to avoid these drawbacks, it was devised to carry out the production of the shells at the plant of the pharmaceutical industry using them, joining the machine producing the shells with the preparation line for the suppositories, but this solution too is not advantageous from the economical and technical standpoint, excepting few pharmaceutical industries having a preparation line of very high output, otherwise the cost of such a complicated machine is not justified. The present invention removes the drawbacks of both these systems adopted up to now, and is the ideal compromise solution avoiding high costs of carrying already shaped shells and at the same time not requiring the high cost of installing a manufacturing machine at each pharmaceutical industry, thus giving a brilliant compromise which is the ideal solution for everybody but more particularly for pharmaceutical industries of small and medium size. The method according to the present invention substan tally consists in joining two continuos tapes of thermoplastic material, making on one of said tapes central holes having a spacing equal to that of the cells and then carrying out joining of the tapes by electronic or thermal welding, at the same time obtaining the outline of the cells which will then be shaped, thus obtaining a continuous band having the plan outline of the cells but still being flat, so as to be transported with little room, and thereafter effecting shaping of the cells by heating the band and blowing air between the two tapes while they are in a mould through said holes made in one of the two tapes, so as to inflate and bring the outline of the cells to their final shape ready for preparation of the suppositories. While joining of the tapes is carried out at the plant making the shells, shaping of the cells is effected at the plant of the pharmaceutical industry preparing the suppositories and this operation may be effected with a very simple apparatus of reduced size and moderate cost, within the reach of any small pharmaceutical industry. The apparatus for shaping the cells, carrying out the method of the present invention, substantially consists of a mould made of two parts or dies closing around the band formed by the two joined tapes and previously heated, each die bearing the cavities of the hemiogives to be made the part of the mould or die, adapted to be contacted with the tape on which the central holes were previously made, has a suction system, adapted to keep the tape adhering during the operation of shaping the cells, and a blowing system to shape said cells.The apparatus provides also means for cooling the mould and means for timed advancement of the band,exactly in register with the cavities of the dies, These and other objects, advantages and features of the invention will anyway be apparent from the following detailed description of the method as well as of an illustrative embodiment of the apparatus for shaping the cells, given only as 2 non limiting example of the invention and with reference to the illustrative figures of the accompanying sheets of drawings, in which Figsw IA and IB jointly taken are a diagram of the several steps of the method according to the present invention Figs 2A is a plan view of a portion of the band formed by the two joined tapes, before shaping the cells by blowing Fig. 2B is a similar plan view of a portion of said band, but after shaping of the cells by means of the apparatus of the present invention Fig.3 is a partially sectioned elevational view of the mould shaping the cells, being the main part of the illustrative apparatus of the present invention Fig. 4 is a sectioned and enlarged lateral view of the mould shown in Fig. 3 Fig. 5 is a top plan view of part of the mould and die bearing the suction and blowing systems and Fig. 6 is a plan sectional view of a die holding plate showing its cooling system.With reference now to the various figures of the accompanying drawings and examining first Figures IA and IB, one can see that the method of the present invention substantially comprises the following steps starting from two feeding rolls A1 and A2 of a tape of thermoplastic material, two tapes B1 andB2 to be joined, are obtained.The first operation carried out on tapes B1 and B2 is punching by means of suitable punching dies or plates C1 and C2 while one of the tapes B1 receives only two rows of punches on the lateral edges, to obtain perforations D like those of photographic or cinematographic films, so as to allow during the step of shaping the cells, the advancement of the tapes in perfect timing and register with the cavities of the shaping die, the other tape 62 in addition to said lateral perforations, receives also a row of central perforations E with a spacing equal to that of the outline of the cells to be shaped.Even if it is not strictly necessary, it is certainly preferable that the lateral perforations D and the central perforations E are aligned and have the same spacing, The two tapes B1 and B2 then go to the actual joining step, carried out by electronic or thermal welding F leaving on the joined tapes the flat outline of two oppositely arranged groups of cells, each group containing a number of cells equal to that being produced at each blow of the shaping mould. In this way the band G is obtained, formed by the two joined tapes and bearing the perforations and the outline of the cells to be shaped, as illustrated in Fig. 2A. This band is wound into rolls H or lengths and is therefore ready for being delivered to the user with the minimum possible room consumption. At the user plant the roll H is unwound and first goes to the printing station I where a printing machine of known type prints the captions on the tape this operation may be effected at one oppositely arranged twin cell for each blow or by groups of cells. In any case it is preferred that the operation of printing the captions is not strictly bound to the subsequent step of shaping the cells and therefore a loop or reserve J of material is provided between the printing station I and the subsequent steps which are the most important part of the method according to the present invention. in this part of the cycle the band G is catched and entrained by a couple of upper belts K1 K2 and a couple of lower belts L1 L2 one couple of belts is provided with cogs having a spacing equal to that of the lateral perforations D of the band G and are inserted into them, while the other couple of belts has a continuous channel pressing on the band G. With this entrainment system, the band G is moved in perfect timing and register with the station for shaping the cells. Prior to shaping, the band G is heated at the heating station M by any system adapted to bring the material into a mouldable condition. It has to be pointed out that a device should be provided, adapted to keep cooled the central zone of the tape 82 where the central perforations E are made, so that this zone does not stick to the corresponding zone of the other tape B1 under the influence of heat. As a matter of fact, this is essential in order that the air, which subsequentlywill be blown, may freely flow along the central channel T formed between the two oppositely arranged rows of cells. This device is preferably formed by a cooled metal blade N or similar thermal screen for this limited zone of the tape 62. The band G then goes to the shaping station, comprised of the apparatus which will be illustrated in its structural details with reference to Figs, 3 6 of the drawings, and at this shaping station the two dies 1 2 bearing the cavities of the hemiogives of the cells, clamp the heated band G and shape the cells by blowing. The die 2 on which lies the tape B2 bearing the central perforations E, has a suction system holding the tape adhering to it, while a blowing system, immediately after suction start, provides to blow air into the central perforations E so as to inflate and shape in the cavities of the dies, the cells whose outline contour is determined by the electronic welding.It has to be noted that the electronic welding determines a general outline of the cell, in which the actual shape and size given by the cavities of the dies may be varied. After each moulding stroke, the band G now bearing the shaped cells P, as shown in Fig. oB, passes over a slitter Q, so as to obtain two continuous rows R. R3 of cells, which are received in a suitable vessel or reservoir and thereafter are fed to the preparation line of the suppositories, preferably after being cut into long lengths e.g. of one thousand cells each, by means of a device S counting the cells and cutting the lengths.Of course this device is dispensed with if the operation of cutting into lengths was already carried out by the manufacturer of the joined topes. Therefore, one can see that the entire cycle is adapted for a continuous and rapid production of shells of suppositories and it is also of great flexibility so as to be suited to the most different requirements of production.The various processing stations 1 aire comprised of very simple devices and generally of a type common in the treatment of tapes of plastic materials, excepting the blow shaping apparatus, which although it is very simple, economical and requiring little room, is especially devised for carrying out the method of the present invention and therefore is now described in detail with re f rence to Figures 3 6 of the accompanying drawings. Thus, with reference now to Figures 3 6 of the accompanying drawings, the apparatus for shaping the cells, diagramatically illustrated in Fig. 1 by dies 0i 02 comprises a rigid support frame formed by crosspieces 1 2 and tierods 3 4 Crosspieces 1 2 bear bushings 5 in which slide the columns 6 supporting the plates or beds 7 which are reciprocated by hydraulic cylinders 8 with their piston rods 9 whose head is secured to the corresponding bed 7. Each bed 7 bears a stationary mould or die 10 having the cavity for the bells 12 of the shells to be shaped, which always have the same sizes, whatever is the volume of the cell or ogive of the shell.On the stationary die 10 the movable lateral dies 13 are applied, containing the cavities for the hemiogives 14 of different sizes according to the type of suppository to be prepared. The movable lateral dies are movably fixed by means of bolts 15 passing through the holes 16 of beds 7 and accessible through the passages 17 made in the crosspieces 1 2. Beds 7 have a cooling system formed by passages 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22 made in their body and ending with the inlet connections 23 and outlet connections 24 for the lines of the cooling fluid circuit. It will be noted that the cooling circuit in the bed 7 is placed toward the inlet edge of the band G coming from the heating station M, so as to cool more the zone which is more subjected to heat. The die or mould 02 facing the tape B2 provided with the central perforations E has also suction and blowing systems being the main features of the illustrated apparatus. In fact this mould shows, at the center of each distance between two cavities of oppositely arranged bells 12, a groove 25 in the form of a ring provided with a little hole 26 communicating with the passage 27 in turn communicating with the line coming from the source of suction or negative pressure, so as to keep tape B2 adhering during shaping in the die of the mould.At the center of each ring 25 there is the nozzle 28 as outlet of channels 29 communicating with passage 30 feeding pressurized air coming from a suitable source not shown 1 It is to be noted that die 02 has a protruding part 31 so as to allow the connection to the lines coming from the suction source and the pressurized air source, respectively. Conversely, the opposite die has a central channel 11 allowing tape B1 to be inflated under the thrust of air coming out from nozzles 28 and to form therein the connection channel for the several cells of the same group. Air cannot escape from the two ends of this channel, as it is hindered by the perimetri cal electronic welding of each group of shaped cells. It Itis to be noted that the groove 25 must perform the function of surrounding the central holes E of tape B2 and therefore may have any suitable perimetrical form, in addition to the circular one, eXg. a square or polygonal form., It is therefore easy to understand that the above described apparatus is a simple and reliable means for forming the cells, allowing to carry out the method of the present invention in a quick and economical manner., It is also to be understood that several variations,modi fications, additions and substitutions of elements may be resorted to the method and apparatus of the present invention, without departing however from spirit and scope nor from its protection range, as defined in the appended claims.
