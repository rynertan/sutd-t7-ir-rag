# AN ENTANGLED NONWOVEN FABRIC INCLUDING BICOMPONENT FIBERS AND THE METHOD OF MAKING SAME

## Abstract
There is disclosed a thermal bonded entangled non woven fabric including conjugate fibers having an exposed low melting point component and a component having a higher melting point. The fabric may include only conjugate fibers or the conjugate fibers may be combined with other fibers. The fabric is formed by forming a web containing conjugate fibers, entangling the fibers of the web, heating the web to heat fuse the low melting point component of the conjugate fibers to fibers of the web at the fiber intersection.
