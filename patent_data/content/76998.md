# Method for preparing condensation polymers by emulsion polymerization.

## Abstract
Polyesters are prepared by reacting aqueous com positions containing an emulsified hydroxyacid or an emul sified mixture comprising a polyfunctional carboxylic acid or anhydride and a polyfunctional alcohol. The emulsion also contains a suitable polycondensation catalyst. The re sultant polyesters are useful as plasticizers and as precur sors for alkyd resins and other polymers.
