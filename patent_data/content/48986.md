## Description
A POLYUREtHANE FOAM COMPOSITION SUITABLE FOR BACKING A SUBSTRATE AND A SUBSTRATE CONTAINING THE POLYURETEANE FOAM COMPOSITION The present invention pertains to a polyurethane foam composition which is the reaction product of a frothed polyurethane forming mixture and to the resultant polyurethane foam backed substrates. Substrates, particulary carpet substrates, have been backed with polyurethane foam as described inU.S. Pat E ts 3,755,212, Dunlap and Parrish 3,821,130,Barron and Dunlap and 3,862,879, Barron and Dunlap wherein the frothed polyurethane forming composition does not contain silicone surfactant and in U.S.Patents 3,706,681, Bachura 3,849,156, Marlin et al. 3,836,560, 3,947,386, 3,957,842, 4,022,722 and 4,022,941, Prokai et al. wherein the frothed polyurethane forming compositions contain a silicone surfactant. The polyurethane foam compositions of the present invention containing polyoxyalkylene siloxane branch copolymers have fine cells and excellent stability during processing. Furthermore, the compositions of the present invention incorporate low amounts of the silicone surfactant s stabilizer , and have improved esthetics and cost over the same polyurethane foams without the silicone surfactant non stabilized or containing linear siloxane surfactants. It is known that penetration weight weight of the polyurethane composition absorbed by a substrate is dependent upon several factors, including type of substrate, component reactivity, temperatllr and nmo nent viscosity.Penetration weight on the commercially available carpet described in this invention had at least about 25 percent reduction compared to non stabilized formulations. The reduced penetration and improved stability has resulted, on the average, in a 20 percent improvement in gauge thickness of foam over non stabilized formulations. Cost to the customer has been effectively reduced by the process of this invention because a product foam backed substrate is obtained that has the same thickness employing less components by weight. In other terms, the same weight of froth is applied to the back of the substrate and a desirably thicker foam is obtained. It is well known in the art that the frothing or mechanical whipping operation of the polyurethane forming composition is performed in high shear equipment such as a Hobart mixer, Firestone mixer, Oakes mixer and similar known equipment. The air or other inert gas should be introduced into the polyurethane forming mixture and whipped under pressure in order to obtain a workable froth. The mechanical whipping operation is conducted such that the pressure at the mixer head outlet is in the range from about 85 to about 200 psig 1.48 MPa , preferably from 85 to 150 psig 0.69 to 1.14 MPa . In those processes where there is no silicone surfactant present, the substrates absorb an inordinate amount of polyurethane forming components thereby resulting in too much absorption beyond what is necessary for tuftbinding. A loss of gauge and a destabilization line at the substrate foam interface occurs, wherein the cell structure becomes coarse and unappealing. The loss of gauge and destabilization line are esthetically unappealing to the buyer and results in higher costs to the vendor. The solution to this without a silicone is a high catalyst level or quick reaction time, which severely limits processing latitude. In those processes wherein a silicone surfactant is employed, large quantities of the silicone surfactant are required in order to obtain fine cells or else stability of the polyurethane forming froth is not sufficient to give a fine celled foam or prevent an inordinate amount of penetration absorption . In the present invention, a large quantity of surfactant 0.5 part limits the processing of the froth because froth viscosity is too high to be adequately processed onto the back of a substrate such as a carpet and the pressure in the mixer head may exceed the working limit of 200 psig 1.48 MPa . Also, in the present invention, the improvement in penetration and gauge is no longer measurable from greater than 0.3 parts surfactant.There is no real advantage, therefore, to using surfactant levels above 0.5 parts from a processing or cost standpoint. The present invention is directed to a polyurethane foam composition which is the reaction product of a frothed polyurethane forming mixture comprising A a polyethylene polyol having an average of from 2 to 8 hydroxyl groups per molecule and an average hydroxyl equivalent weight of from 100 to 3000 B a polyol having an vra of from 2 to 8 hydroxyl groups per molecule and an average hydroxyl equivalent weight of from 31 to 230, component B being optional when component A contains an end cap of at least two moles of ethylene oxide per active hydrogen atom or an internal block of at least three moles of ethylene oxide residues per active hydrogen atom, when components A and B are employed together, they are employed in proportions providing from 50 to 95 parts by weight of component A and from 50 to 5 parts by weight of component B based upon 100 parts by weight of the total quantity of components A and B , the hydroxyl equivalent weight of component A is at least 1.5 times greater than the hydroxyl equivalent weight of component B , the mixture of components A and B or component A when employed alone has a Brookfield viscosity employing a number 2 spindle at 12 rpm of at least 100 centipoise 0.1 Pascal second at 250C C an organic polyisocyanate or polyisothio cyanate having an average of from 2 to 4 NCX groups per molecule, each X being indepen dently oxygen or sulfur, components A , B and C being employed in quantities so as to provide an NCXjo4 ratio of from 0.85 1 to 2 1 D at least one inorganic filler E , at least one catalyst for reacting components A and B with component C , component E being employed in a quantity such that an unfrothed .m.iYtu of mponents to , B , C , E and F obtains a Brookfield vis cosity employing a number 4 spindle at 30 rpm greater than 10,000 centipoise 10 Pascal seconds at 250C in less than 40 minutes and F a silicone surfactant, characterized in that component F is a poly dimethylsiloxane polyoxyalkylene branch copolymer having an average molecular weight ofless than 30,000, preferably less than 10,000, wherein at least 60 percent by weight, preferably 100 percent by weight, of the polyoxyalkylene groups are oxyethylene groups, the dimethylsiloxane content of the copolymer being from 15 to 40 percent by weight, and at least 40 percent of the weight of the copolymer is derived from the oxyethylene groups, component F being present in a quantity from 0.02 to less than 0.5 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the combined weights of components A and B .

Another run tank containing the polyisocyanate was maintained at a temperature not less than 600F 160C . The contents of the run tanks, and catalyst were metered into an Oakes frother where the contents were frothed employing air as the inert gas. The resultant froth was then placed onto the back of the carpet via a hose and doctored to the desired thickness.The froth exit temperature was maintained at a temperature of at least 860F. 300C , The carpet containing the polyurethane forming froth composition was then cured in an oven at a temperature of 2500F 1210C . The carpet onto which the frothed polyurethaneforming compositions were doctored was a flat level loop carpet containing 100 percent continuous filament nylon pile weighing 14 oz yd2 0.47 Kg m2 tufted at a gauge of 0.1 inch 3 mm through an FLW woven polypropylene needlepunched with nylon or polypropylene fiber primary backing weighing 4.25 oz yd2 0.144 Kg m2 at a stitch rate of 8 per inch and a pile height of 0.125 inch 3.18 mm . In the following examples and comparative runs, the properties were determined by the following tests. The viscosity of the unfilled urethane forming components is obtained by mixing the components for 3 minute s and placing 10 ml. of the resultant mixture in a Brookfield LVF Viscometer, maintaining the temperature of the mixture at 250C f 0.50C and determining the viscosity over the desired period of time.The Brookfield LVF Viscometer was employed using a number 4 spindle rotating at 30 rpm. The viscosity of a mixture of polyols A and B or the viscosity of polyol A when employed alone is obtained by placing 200 ml of the mixture of polyols A and B or polyol A alone in a Brookfield LVFViscometer, maintaining the temperature of the material being measured at 250C, i 0.50C, and determining the viscosity employing a number 2 spindle rotating at 12 rpm. Penetration weight was calculated by subtracting the greige weight the weight of the carpet sample to which the polyurethane forming froth composition was applied so as to provide a secondary backing , from the greige weight plus polyurethane forming materials which had soaked into the tufts and primary backing which was the weight of the sample after skiving the foam from the back of the carpet sample and brushing with a wire brush to remove as much of the remaining foam as possible. The cell count was determined employing a microscope equipped with a Polaroid camera to take photomicrographs of foam and visually count the number of cells along the surface plane in a given area. Each area was ten units by ten units, each unit being 0.005 inches 0.1 mm 0.0025 inch2 l.6 mm2 . The pictures were taken of the foam surface at or near the center of the foam after splitting the foam for this purpose.The surface plane after splitting was dyed so that individual cells were clearly visible. The foam density was determined by the following formula 0.08333 x coating weight penetration wt. oz yd2 Gauge, inches density, lb ft3 1000 x coating weight penetration wt. Kg m2 Gauge, mm density, Kg ma The coating weight was obtained by subtracting the greige weight from the total sample weight of the carpet greige and foam.
