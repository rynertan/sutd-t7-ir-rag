# Secondary air control damper arrangement.

## Abstract
A tangentially fired furnace 2 defining a combustion chamber having a windbox 1 in each corner of the furnace. The secondary air is supplied to the furnace through a set of vertically tiltable nozzles 9,10,11,11,12 mounted in each windbox. A secondary air supply conduit 16 is mounted to each windbox to feed the tiltable nozzles therein. Each secondary air supply conduit has a section 15 adjacent to the nozzles having straightening vanes 19,20 forming channels 21,22,23 in which independently controlled louvers 25,26,27 regulate the total cross sectional area of the channels to maintain the desired velocity of the secondary air through the nozzles.
