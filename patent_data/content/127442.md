# Piezoelectric resonator.

## Abstract
A piezoelectric resonator comprises a rectangular paral lelepiped resonator chip. A lithium niobate single crystal 4 is used as the resonator chip material. Each of the opposed main surfaces of the resonator chip is arranged to be a surface of a rotated Y cut plate 2 which is rotated by an angle Ï‘ of 165 5 degrees about an X axis. The angle of the longitudinal direction of the resonator chip is arranged to be 90 5 degrees with respect to the X axis of the rotated Y cut plate.
