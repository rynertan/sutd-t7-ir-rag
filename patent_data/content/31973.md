# OBJECT MEASURING ARRANGEMENT

## Abstract
The invention relates to the control of the automatic assembly of products from piece parts or objects, under the control of a computer supplied with a visual input of the assembly area. A considerably simplification of the computer programme can be made if the dimensions of an object 4 appearing in the visual input can be measured independently of their position within a working volume having linear dimensions several times those of the object. An optical paral lel projection system is provided, having a large diameter fresnel lens 5 and an objective lens 8, in which a projection of the object is made onto a television camera photocathode 9 at a constant scale independently of the position of the object both in the projection plane and normal to it. A usefully extended depth of focus, at constant scale, is obtained by thresholding the camera signal output. The measurements are made from the relative positions of object edge signals in the camera rastor 11.
