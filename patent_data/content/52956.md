# A bus access circuit for high speed digital data communication.

## Abstract
A serial data communications network in which a plurality of stations communicate among one another in an orderly and collision free manner on a single serial bus. Each station incorporates an improved bus access circuit to operate in cooperation with the bus access circuit of every other station in the network. The resulting effect as to each station is the assignment of a unique, recurring time window during which the station may initiate a transmission on the serial bus exclusive of all other stations.
