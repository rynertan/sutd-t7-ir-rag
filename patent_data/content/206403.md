# High speed packet switching arrangement.

## Abstract
A circuit arrangement is provided for switching serial data packets through a network destined for one of a plurali ty of possible outgoing lines 104, 106, 108 . Minimal delay is achieved by shifting the data through a shift register 120 having length equivalent to the destination address of the incoming serial data packet. The shift register addresses a memory 126 which in turn controls a switch network 138 so that the incoming packet is switched with minimal delay to an appropriate outbound line. By utilizing random access memory to translate from destination address to switch po sition, the system may be altered to correct for changes in the overall network caused by network failures or expan sion network or to allow dynamic load balancing by direct ing data through the switch to a control computer 134 which in turn rewrites the memory.
