As shown in the above, the process for preparing an anthracycline derivative according to the present invention includes the preparation of one known compound, 4 tetrahydropyranyl adriamycin, which, however, is prepared by a new process which constitutes that the process for preparing thereof is a novel invention. The compounds obtained above exist as a mixture of diastereomer a and b in the reaction mixture. If necessary, the diastereomer a and b can be separated from each other by known methods, and purified from the reaction mixture by conventional methods used for the purification of various anthracycline glycosides.As an example, after filtering the reaction mixture to remove solid materials, the filtrate can be concentrated to dryness and then the resulting crude powder can be purified by column or thin layer chromatography using alumina, silica gel etc.. The relationship between the structure of the compounds a and b is considered to be the difference in absolute configuration R and S of the chiral center of the 4 0 substituted ether groups since both compounds respectively have different chemical shifts of the methine proton of the chiral center. The compounds in the present invention possess marked anti tumor activity against various experimental animal tumors, particularly anthracycline derivatives having the general formula I, wherein R1 is a hydrogen atom or a hydroxyl group, possess potent anti tumor activity and less toxicity than adriamycin, and can be advantageously used as antitumor agents. Furthermore, the anthracycline derivatives having the general formula I, wherein R1 is such an alkanoyloxy group having a carbon number of 2 to 7 as an acetyloxy, isobutyloxy or phenylacetyloxy group, can be preferably used as an intermediate of the anthracycline derivatives having the hydroxyl group at R1 in the compound I.
