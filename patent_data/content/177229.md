# IMPROVEMENTS IN VEHICLE SEATS

## Abstract
A tractor seat of the type having a seat pan 14 which is hooked on to a vertically movable spring biassed carriage 12, so that the seat pan can be released and moved out of the way of a standing driver, has a latch device 18 comprising a headed pin 20 secured to the pan 14 and a catch plate 22 secured to the carriage and formed with an aperture 22a for receiving the headed pin 20. The catch plate is resilient so that it can be bent away from the pin to release the seat pan. In particular the aperture tapers from the lower end normally occupied by the pin to an upper end through which the head of the pin cannot pass, so that accidental lifting of the pan will lock the headed pin within the aperture.
