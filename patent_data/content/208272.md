## Description
The present invention relates to a method for the preparation of alkyl esters of 3,4 epoxybutyric acid of formula Alkyl esters of 3,4 epoxybutyric acid I are an interesting class of compounds, endowed with peculiar features, which can be used as monomers and co monomers in several kinds of polymerizations and co polymerizations furthermore they are important intermediates for sophisticated products endowed with biological and or pharmaceutical activity. Starting from alkyl esters of 3,4 epoxybutyric acid there may be obtained functional adenine derivatives, which are very useful in affinity chromatography or as macromolecular co enzymes, not diffusable and water soluble, these derivatives being obtained by allowing esters of epoxybutyric acid to react with adenine or derivatives thereof. Starting from the al kyl esters of 3,4 epoxybutyric acid it is possible to obtain the chloride of R,S carnitine and other analogous derivatives of carnitine . The importance of the R form thereof in the transfer of fatty acids through membranes is well known carnitine catalyzes the oxidation of long chain fatty acids and takes part in the transfer, by means of enzymes, of fatty acids activated by cytoplasm towards the β oxidation sites within mitochondrias. It is furthermore known to use the alkyl esters of 3,4 epoxy butyric acid for the synthesis of derivatives of 2 oxo 1 pyrrolidine acetamide, as described in EP A 154 490 said derivatives are valuable psychotropic drugs which can restore the activity of cognitive processes impaired by different pathologic conditions. The preparation of alkyl esters of 3,4 epoxybutyric acids, however,was hitherto been carried out with not very satisfactory results, with clearly negative influences at the industrial economic level these influences partially or totally make void the advantageous features of alkyl esters of 3,4 epoxybutyric acid. It is known to prepare esters of 3,4 epoxybutyric acid by oxidation of the corresponding vinylacetetes with peracids like, for instance, peracetic or m chloroperbenzoic acid in organic solvents however, yields and long reaction times 4 10 days as well as the cost of the oxidizing agents, which have to be used in at least stoichiometric quantity with respect of the substrate make this process of limited practical interest. There also is reported a synthesis of the methyl ester of 3,4 epoxybutyric acid starting from epichlorohydrin, by carbomethoxylation with carbon mono oxide and methanol in the presence of cobalt cabonyl , formation of 4 chloro 3 hydroxybutyric acid methyl ester and subsequent epoxide closure with silver oxide however, this process is of no practical interest at the industrial level, because of drastic conditions, low yields and the high cost of some reactants. EP A 109273 describes peroxide compositions of formula QXW There has now been found a simple and cheap method for the synthesis of alkyl esters of 3,4 epoxybutyric acid, free of the above mentioned drawbacks this method provides products which, because of their purity level and low price also resulting from the very high yields of the synthesis ,are fairly good intermediates for the preparation of many chemical compounds endowed with biological and or pharmaceutical activity. In its broadest form the present invention relates to a method for the preparation of alkyl esters of 3,4 epoxybutyric acid of formula I , wherein the corresponding vinylacetate of formula II is catalytically oxidized, under phase transfer conditions, in a biphasic liquid system comprising The oxidation reaction can be represented as follows The epoxide is obtained within comparatively short periods of time 1 3 hrs , with high yields based on H₂O₂ 80 85 and with a fairly good selectivity with respect to the vinylacetate about 90 , with clear positive influences on the possible industrial application. When the alkyl group R contains 4 to 10 carbon atoms the esters are obtained with better yields, R contains from 1 to 3 C atoms. The best results were obtained when using a particular catalyst of formula Catalysts III and IV consist of peroxidic compounds containing tungsten, P and a quaternary ammonium cation showing sufficient affinity for lipids, obtained according to usual techniques. These catalysts, for instance, can be prepared by reacting a tungstic acid or an alkaline tungstate , phosphoric acid or an alkaline phosphate and hydrogen peroxide in an acidic aqueous phase with a quaternary salt selected from methyltrioctylammonium chloride known on the market as ALIQUAT 336 and dimethyl dioctadecyl 75 dihexadecyl 25 ammonium chloride known on the market as ARQUAD 2HT , contained in an organic phase immiscible with the aqueous phase. The reaction of the inorganic reactants can be carried out between 20 and 80 C thereafter, the quaternary salt dis solved in a solvent, for instance 1,2 dichloroethane, is added, preferably at room temperature, while continuing the stirring of the biphasic mixture for 15 30 minutes. The acidic phase had a pH lower than 2 in order to obtain said range of values, the pH is adjusted, if necessary, with a mineral acid for instance H₂SO₄ or HCl . The molar ratios of the reactants must denerally be as follows for 1 mole of P, 4 moles of W and up to 2 moles of quaternary salt are used as to H₂O₂, from 2.5 to 6 moles of H₂O₂ are sufficient for 1 mole of W. After having separated the phases, by evaporating the organic phase, the compound III or IV is obtained in syrupy or solid form respectively. The epoxidation reaction is carried out according to the double phase technique the organic phase contains the vinylacetate, the catalyst and, optionally, a solvent immiscible with the aqueous phase. If a solvent is not used, a suitable excess of vinylacetate can be used. Chlorinated hydrocarbons like, for instance, dichloroethanes, trichloroethane and tetrachloroethylene or aromatic, optionally substituted, hydrocarbons e.g. benzene, toluene or xylenes can be used as immiscible solvents. Generally, it is possible to work under strong stirring, at a temperature between 50 and 90 C, preferably between 65 and 75 C, under atmospheric pressure, and the reaction time depending on the used catalyst and its amount, the working temperature and the concentration of the vinylacetate in the organic phase generally between 1 and 3 hours the catalyst is preferably used in a H₂O₂ catalyst molar ratio between 200 and 100. Finally, it is advisable to work with a H₂O₂ substrate molar ratio between 1 1 and 1 2 and preferably from 1 1.5 to 1 1.6 when a solvent is used the concentration of substrate II in the organic phase generally is between 30 and 90 , and preferably between 50 and 80 by weight. It is advisable to use, in the aqueous phase,a H₂O₂ concentration between 1 and 70 , and preferably between 10 and 30 by weight thereby H₂O₂ conversions of 98 99 may be achieved. At the end of the reaction, after having separated the phases, the product present in the organic phase , may be separated from the catalyst together with unreacted vinylacetate II and with the solvent by a quick pre distillation under vacuum the distillate then is fractionated under vacuum, thus obtaining product I in pure form obviously, these are usual methods, allowing possible alternatives. The method according to the invention can be performed employing usual apparatus and expedients. The catalyst is sufficiently stable and, therefore, it can be prepared and stored until it is used. The invention will be further described in the following examples, given to merely illustrate the present invention, without limiting the scope thereof.

Under vigorous stirring, the biphasic mixture was heated to 70 C and kept at this temperature for 2.5 hours a conversion yield based on H₂O₄ 99 was obtained determination by iodometric titration of the aqueous phase . The organic lower phase was separated, filtered and, after having evaporated the solvent, quickly pre distilled under vacuum 6.65 26.6 hPa 5 20 mmHg , what left a residue 4.7 g containing the catalyst and the heavy products about 1.9 g . The distilled product was analyzed gas chromatographically, using a glass column 1.5 m x 2 mmID packed with 5 Carbowax 20M on Chromosorb W HP 60 80 mesh at 75 200 C 10 C 1 internal standard n hexanol and was found to contain 26.8 g of epoxide 169.6 mmols and 16 g of unreacted vinylacetate 112.7 mmols , the epoxide yield calculated on the charged H₂O₂ being thus 84.8 and the epoxide selectivity calculated on the consumed vinylacetate being 90.5 . Thereafter the epoxide was separated from vinylacetate by fractional distillation under vacuum boiling point 116 118 C at 53hPa 40 mmHg . IR and ¹H NMR spectra of the product were in agreement with the formula, I of the epoxide, wherein R was Example 1 a was repeated, replacing ARQUAD 2HT by 1.6 g of methyltrioctylammonium chloride ALIQUAT 336 , thereby obtaining 2.82 g of a syrup the analytical data were in agreement with the indicated formula, as shown hereinafter Example 1 b was repeated, using the catalyst prepared according to example 2 a 2.26 g, about 1 mmol , thereby obtaining analogous results 26.86 g 170 mmols of epoxide 85 yield on the charged H₂O₂ . 10ml of H₂O, 6.56ml of 40 H₂O₂ 77 millimoles , 1.3 g 0.57 millimoles of the catalyst prepared according to example 2 a , dissolved in 20ml of benzene, and 20 g 200 millimoles of the methyl ester of vinylacetate were placed in a 100ml flask provided with blade stirrer, reflux cooler and thermometer. The mixture was heated to 70 C under vigo rous stirring and kept at said temperature for 2.5 hours ,the organic phase being then treated as in example 1. Obtained were 4.52 g of epoxide 39 millimoles , corresponding to an epoxide yield calculated on the charged H₂O₂ of 50.3 .
