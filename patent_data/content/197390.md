# Preparation of N acetyl serotonine and melatonine.

## Abstract
A process for the preparation of N acetyl serotonine characterised in that serotonine is acetylated to form N, O diacetyl serotonine which is then treated with an alkaline mixture of water and a lower alcohol to selectively hydrolyse the O acetyl group of the N, O diacetyl serotonine to give N acetyl serotonine. The melatonine is prepared by methy lating the N acetyl serotonine in the 5 position.
