## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTIONPENICILLIN DERIVATIVES AS ANTI INFLAMMATORY ANDANTI DEGENERATIVE AGENTSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION We have found that derivatives of penicillin, their sulfoxides and sulfones are potent elastase inhibitors. They are therefore useful antiinflammatory and anti degenerative agents. Proteases from granulocytes and macrophages have been reported to be responsible for the chronic tissue destruction mechanisms associated with inflammation, including rheumatoid arthritis and emphysema. Accordingly, specific and selective inhibitors of these proteases are candidates for potent anti inflammatory agents useful in the treatment of inflammatory conditions that cause connective tissue destruction, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, emphysema, bronchial inflammation, osteoarthritis, spondylitis, lupus, psoriasis and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The role of proteases from granulocytes, leukocytes or macrophages are related to a rapid series of events which occurs during the progression of an inflammatory condition 1 There is a rapid production of prostaglandins PG and related compounds synthesized from arachidonic acid. This PG synthesis has been shown to be inhibited by aspirin related nonsteroidal anti inflammatory agents including indomethacin and phenylbutazone. There is some evidence that protease inhibitors prevent PG production 2 There is also a change in vascular permeability which causes a leakage of fluid into the inflamed site and the resulting edema is generally used as a marker for measuring the degree of inflammation. This process has been found to be induced by the proteolytic or peptide cleaving activity of proteases, especially those contained in the granulocyte, and can therefore be controlled by various synthetic protease inhibitors, for example, N acyl benzisothiazolones and the respective l,l dioxides. Morris Zimmerman et al., J. Biol. Chem., 255, 9848 1980 and B. Ashe et al., J. Biol. Chem., 256, 11603 1981 . 3 There is an appearance and or presence of lymphoid cells, especially macrophages and polymorphonuclear leukocytes PMN . It has been known that a variety of proteases are released from the macrophages and PMN, further indicating that the proteases do play an important role in inflammation. In general, proteases are an important family of enzymes within the peptide bond cleaving enzymes whose members are essential to a variety of normal biological activities, such as digestion, formation and dissolution of blood clots, the formation of active forms of hormones, the immune reaction to foreign cells and organisms, etc., and in pathological conditions such as the degradation of structural proteins at the articular cartilage pannus junction in rheumatoid arthritis etc. Elastase is one of the proteases. It is an enzyme capable of hydrolyzing the connective tissue component elastin, a property not contained by the bulk of the proteases present in mammals. It acts on a protein s nonterminal bonds which are adjacent to an aliphatic amino acid. Neutrophil elastase is of particular interest because it has the broadest spectrum of activity against natural connective tissue substrates. In particular, the elastase of the granulocyte is important because, as described above, granulocytes participate in acute inflammation and in acute exacerbation of chronic forms of inflammation which characterize many clinically important inflammatory diseases. Proteases may be inactivated by inhibitors which block the active site of the enzyme by binding tightly thereto. Naturally occurring protease inhibitors form part of the control or defense mechanisms that are crucial to the well being of an organism. Without these control mechanisms, the proteases would destroy any protein within reach.The naturally occurring enzyme inhibitors have been shown to have appropriate configurations which allow them to bind tightly to the enzyme. This configuration is part of the reason that inhibitors bind to the enzyme so tightly see Stroud, A Family ofProtein Cutting Proteins Sci. Am. July 1974, pp.74 88 . For example, one of the natural inhibitors, al Antitrypsin, is a glycoprotein contained in human serum that has a wide inhibitory spectrum covering, among other enzymes, elastase both from the pancreas and the PMN. This inhibitor is hydrolyzed by the proteases to form a stable acyl enzyme in which the active site is no longer available. Marked reduction in serum a1 antitrypsin, either genetic or due to oxidants, has been associated with pulmonary emphysema which is a disease characterized by a progressive loss of lung elasticity and resulting respiratory difficulty. It has been reported that this loss of lung elasticity is caused by the progressive, uncontrolled proteolysis or destruction of the structure of lung tissue by proteases such as elastase released from leukocytes.J. C. Powers, TIBS, 211 1976 . Rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by a progressive destruction of articular cartilage both on the free surface bordering the joint space and at the erosion front built up by synovial tissue toward the cartilage. This destruction process, in turn, is attributed to the protein cutting enzyme elastase which is a neutral protease present in human granulocytes. This conclusion has been supported by the following observations 1 Recent histochemical investigations showed the accumulation of granulocytes at the cartilage pannus junction in rheumatoid arthritis and 2 a recent investigation of mechanical behavior of cartilage in response to attack by purified elastase demonstrated the direct participation of granulocyte enzymes, especially elastase, in rheumatoid cartilage destruction. H. Menninger et al., in Biological Functions of Proteinases, H. Holzer and H. Tschesche, eds. Springer Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg, New York, 1979, pp. 196 206. Accordingly, an object of this invention is to discover new protease inhibitors, especially elastase inhibitors, useful for controlling tissue damage and various inflammatory or degenerative conditions mediated by proteases particularly elastase. Another object of the present invention is to provide pharmaceutical compositions for administering the active substituted penicillin derivatives, their sulfoxides and sulfones as protease inhibitors. Still a further object of this invention is to provide a method of controlling inflammatory conditions by administering a sufficient amount of one or more of the active, substituted penicillin derivatives, their sulfoxides and sulfones in a mammalian species in need of such treatment.

C. Utility of the compounds within the scope of the invention This invention also relates to a method of treatment for patients or mammalian animals raised in the dairy, meat, or fur industries or as pets suffering from inflammation, degeneration or pain.More specifically, it relates to a method of treatment involving the administration of a compound of formula I as the active constituent. For the treatment of inflammation and pain a compound of formula I may be administered orally, topically, parenterally, by inhalation spray or rectally in dosage unit formulations containing conventional non toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants and vehicles. The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous injections, intravenous, intramuscular, intrasternal injection or infusion techniques. In addition to the treatment of warm blooded animals such as horses, cattle, sheep, dogs, cats, etc., the compounds of the invention are effective in the treatment of humans. The pharmaceutical compositions containing the active ingredient may be in a form suitable for oral use, for example, as tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, or syrups or elixirs. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparation. Tablets containing the active ingredient in admixture with non toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients may also be manufactured by known methods.The excipients used may be for example, 1 inert diluents such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate 2 granulating and disintegrating agents such as corn starch, or alginic acid 3 binding agents such as starch, gelatin or acacia, and 4 lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed. They may also be coated by the techniques described in the U.S.Patents 4,256,108 4,160,452 and 4,265,874 to form osmotic therapeutic tablets for controlled release. In some cases, formulations for oral use may be in the form of hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin. They may also be in the form of soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil. Aqueous suspensions normally contain the active materials in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions.Such excipients may be 1 suspending agents such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia 2 dispersing or wetting agents which may be a a naturally occurring phosphatide such as lecithin, b a condensation product of an alkylene oxide with a fatty acid, for example, polyoxyethylene stearate, c a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a long chain aliphatic alcohol, for example, heptadeca ethyleneoxycetanol, d a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a partial ester derived from a fatty acid and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or e a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a partial ester derived from a fatty acid and a hexitol anhydride, for example polyoxy ethylene sorbitan monooleate. The aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives, for example, ethyl or n propyl p hydroxybenzoate one or more coloring agents one or more flavoring agents and one or more sweetening agents such as sucrose or saccharin. Oily suspension may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in a mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents and flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an antioxidant such as ascorbic acid. Dispersible powders and granules are suitable for the preparation of an aqueous suspension. They provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, a suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients, for example, those sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents described above may also be present. The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of oil in water emulsions. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil such as olive oil or arachis oils, or a mineral oil such as liquid paraffin or a mixture thereof.Suitable emulsifying agents may be 1 naturallyoccurring gums such as gum acacia and gum tragacanth, 2 naturally occurring phosphatides such as soy bean and lecithin, 3 esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example, sorbitan monooleate, 4 condensation products of said partial esters with ethylene oxide, for example, polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The emulsions may also contain sweetening and flavoring agents. Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol or sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a preservative and flavoring and coloring agents. The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to known methods using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3 butane diol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer s solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables. A compound of I may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials are cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols. For topical use, creams, ointments, jellies, solutions or suspensions, etc., containing the anti inflammatory agents are employed. Dosage levels of the order from about 1 mg to about 100 mg per kilogram of body weight per day are useful in the treatment of the above indicated conditions from about 50 mg to about 5 gms. per patient per day . For example, inflammation is effectively treated and anti pyretic and analgesic activity manifested by the administration from about 2.5 to about 75 mg of the compound per kilogram of body weight per day about 75 mg to about 3.75 gms per patient per day . The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration.For example, a formulation intended for the oral administration of humans may contain from 5 mg to 5 gm of active agent compounded with an appropriate and convenient amount of carrier material which may vary from about 5 to about 95 percent of the total composition. Dosage unit forms will generally contain between from about 25 mg to about 500 mg of active ingredient. It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy. D. Biological evidence in support of utility of the invention It has been found that the compounds ofFormula I have anti inflammatory antidegeneration activity as shown below in Tables II, III and IV by the effective inhibition of the proteolytic function of human granulocyte elastase.
