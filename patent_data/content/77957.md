# Semi conductive compositions, based on ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers, having adhesion to and strippability from crosslinked polyolefin substrates.

## Abstract
Semi conductive compositions, based on ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers or chlorinated products thereof, contain ing carbon black, a silicone compound and an interface crosslink inhibitor, such as a phonol, a quinone, a thiazole or a thiutam sulfide, which find utility as semi conductive layers about crosslinked polyolefin substrates of electrical conduc tors.
