# Lustrous satin appearing, opaque film compositions and method of preparing same.

## Abstract
The present invention is directed to an opaque, bi axially oriented polymeric film structure of lustrous satin appearance comprising a thermoplastic core matrix having a strata of voids said voids being created by the inclusion within the matrix material of spherical void initiating solid particles which are incompatible with the matrix material. The void space occupied by the particle is substantially less than the volume of the void. The polymer matrix material is extruded in the form of a film and positioned on opposite surface of the film are void free, transparent thermoplastic skin layers adhering to said surfaces. The structure has excellent opacity and extremely high gloss measurement and a lustrous satin appearance.
