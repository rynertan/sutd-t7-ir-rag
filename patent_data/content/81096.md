# IMAGE ROTATE CONTROL CIRCUITRY

## Abstract
Image rotate control circuitry buffers one column of display or video data which is subsequently printed along a horizontal print line. A video dot counter 205 cycles each horizontal scan line while a print line counter 207 cycles each vertical scan. Video data is entered into the buffer 250 when the count in the video dot counter equals the count in the print line counter. After one refresh of the display the buffer contains one print line of data. This data is shifted from the buffer to the printer during the vertical retrace or vertical blank period of the display. The control circuitry sends a strobe signal to the printer for the print operation as a new column of data is being buffered during the next refresh of the display.
