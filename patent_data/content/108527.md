# REMOTE OPTIC ATMOSPHERE MONITOR AND METHOD FOR DETERMINING A FOREIGN SUBSTANCE IN A FLUID

## Abstract
A device and method for determination of a foreign substance in a fluid. A fiber optic cord is wound back and forth on a plurality of upstanding posts encapsulated within a solid mass. A plurality of openings extend through the mass transecting the cord at multiple locations along the cord path. A specified light is directed through the cord with the fluid and foreign substance being introduced into the openings. The light exiting the cord is measured with the foreign substance then being determined. An alternate embodiment includes a fiber optic cord enclosed within a membrane with a plurality of openings being provided in the cord. The cord is percutaneously injected into a person while attached to a light source and detector apparatus allowing for the determination of the foreign substance in the fluid being measured.
