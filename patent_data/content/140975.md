# REACTIVE ION ETCHING APPARATUS.

## Abstract
The reactive ion etching apparatus is basically similar to a conventional apparatus which subjects an Si material to reac tive ion etching. The inner surfaces of a vacuum vessel 1 or a substrate electrode 4 and an opposite electrode 5 are coated with polyethylene tetrafluoride, and a ring 17 of polyethylene tetrafluoride is provided around an object being etched on a substrate electrode, or a porous plate 15 of polyethylene tetrafluoride is provided between the substrate electrode and the opposite electrode. Thus, when discharge starts to take place in a treatment gas of a fluorine compound CF₄,C₃F₈, etc. , substances ions or radicals of fluorine and fluorine compounds which contribute to the etching are gen erated from the treatment gas, and substances which contri bute to the etching are also generated from the constituent parts coated with the polyethylene tetrafluoride as well as the polyethylene tetrafluoride ring and porous plate. Therefore, unlike in the prior art, it is advantageously possible to increase the etching rate of an Si material without reducing the etching rate ratio selected according to the resist used.

SPBCIFI CATION ITIE OF THE INVENTION Reactive Ion Etching Apparatus TECHNICAL PIES This invention relates to a reactive ion etching apparatus in the manufscturing process for electronic parts, such as semiconductors. This invention is directed to provision of a reactive ion etching apparatus for Si series material, which increases an etching rate thereof without increasing the power irom a power source. BIL GROUXD ART A conventional reactive ion etching apparatus for Si series material1 as concretely shown in Pig. 1, has a vacuum container 1 provided with an evacuation end connection 2 connected to an evacuation leans not shown , a working gas supply conduit 31 a substrate electrode 4, and an opposite electrode 5, the substrate electrode 4 connecting to a high frequency power source 6, the working gas having used a fluorine compound CF4, C3F8, etc. . Reference numeral 7 designates an object to be etched.Such reactive ion etching apparatus for Si series material, however, should increase the power from a power source in order to increase an etching rate of Si series material1 whereby a selection ratio of etching rate to a resist material etching rate of 8i series material that of resist material serving as the master pattern decreases, thereby having been defective in that the reactive ion etching as the master pattern cannot be carried out.DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION A reactive ion etching apparatus of the invention is basically the same in construction as the conventional reactive ion etching apparatus for Si series material, in which the inner surface of a vacuum container, a substrate electrode, or an opposite electrode is coated with polytetrafluoro ethylene, a ring made irom polytetrafluoroethylene is provided around the object to be etched on the substrate electrode, or a perforated plate formed of polytetrafluoroethylene is interposed between the substrate electrode and the opposite electrode, so that when electric discharge starts in the working gas of fluorine compound CF4, 3F8, etc. , not only a substance ion or radical of fluorine and fluorine compound contributing to etching is produced from the working gas, but also the substance contributing to the same is produced from the components the ring and perforate plate, coated with polytetrafluoro ethylene. Hence, the reactive ion etching apparatus of the invention has the particular effect such that the etching rate of Si series material increases without decreasing the selection ratio of etching rate with respect to the resist material as the conventional. BRIEP DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS rig. 1 is a schematic view of the conventional reactive ion etching apparatus for Si series material, Fig. 2 is a schematic view of an embodiment of a reactive ion etching apparatus for Si series material of the invention, and Fig. 3 is a graph showing the result in comparison of a relation between the high frequency power and a SiO film in this embodiment and conventional example with that of selection ratio between the high frequency power and the etching rate.BEST NODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION Next, an embodiment of the invention will be described in accordance with Figs. 2 and 3. Fig. 2 is a schematic view of the embodiment of a reactive ion etching apparatus for Si series material of the invention, in which reference numeral 8 designates a vacuum container, 9 designates an evacuation outlet, 10 designates a working gas supply inlet, 11 designates a substrate electrode, 12 designates an opposite electrode, 13 designates a high frequency power source, and 14 designates an object to be etched, 15 designates a perforated plate formed of polytetrafluoroethylene, the perforated plate 15 used in this embodiment having bores each of 8 mm in diameter, 10 mm in bore pitch, and a mm in thickness, 16 designates stays for supporting the perforated plate and formed of an alumina insulator, the stays 16 in this embodiment having been designed to keep an interval of 10 mm between the perforated bore plate and the object to be etched the upper surface of wafer , and 17 designates a ring of poly tetrafluoroethylene. he ring 17 used in this embodiment is 101 rmn in an inner diameter, 152 n in an outer diameter, and 5 mm in thickness.The apparatus constructed as foregoing is used to carry out the reactive ion etching for Si series material of the invention under the following etching conditions Working gas C3F8 Perfluoropropane Gas flow rate 50 SC M Degree of vacuum 0.08 Torr Power supplied 200 to 500 W Object to be etched SiOv film on a Si wafer of 100 m in an outer diameter 6000 23 Fig. 3 is a graph showing the result in comparison of the selection ratio of the etching rate of 8i02 film to that of the resist material in this embodiment with the reactive ion etching carried out by use of the conventional apparatus in Fig. 1 under the same condition as this embodiment, in which the line A shows the result in this embodiment and B the conventional example.As seen from Fig. 3, in this embodiment, the ring of polytetrafluoroethylene is provided around the object to be etched and the perforated plate of polytetrafluoroethylene is provided between the opposite electrode and the substrate electrode, thereby enabling the etching rate of SiO2 film to increase without reducing the selection ratio of etching rate to the resist material. The reason for this is that the provision of the ring and perforated plate formed of polytetrafluoroethylene, when electric discharge starts in the working gas of fluorine compound C3F8 , produces also from polytetrafluoroethylene substances ozntributing to etching other than those of ion or radical of fluorine and fluorine compound produced from the working gas and contributing to etching.

Furthermore, the object to be etched may alternatively be any one of single crystal, polycrystalline Si film and silicon nitride film. INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY Bs seen from the above, the Si series material reactive ion etching apparatus of the invention is so constructed that one, two or the whole of the inner surface of vacuum container, opposite electrode and substrate electrode, is coated.with poly tetrafluoroethylene, the ring formed thereof is provided around the object to be etched, or the perforated plate is interposed between the opposite electrode and the substrate electrode, thereby enabling the etching rate of Si series material to increase without reducing the selection ratio of etching rate to the resist, thereby having a higher etching effect.
