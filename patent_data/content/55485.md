# Information signal regenerating stylus and manufacturing method thereof.

## Abstract
An information reproducing stylus, with a stylus base 11 on which an electrode 12 is applied, to reproduce an information signal as a variance of electrostatic capacity in conjunction with a running disc recording medium in which the information signal is recorded as a variance in a geometrical shape and a manufacturing method thereof which comprises forming a prism 13 on a tip of the conical or pyramidal stylus base 11 , so that part of the side of the stylus base provided with the electrode 12 becomes a side of the prism 13 and forming a sliding face 15 with the disc recording medium on a tip of the prism 13 .
