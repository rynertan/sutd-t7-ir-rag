# Radiation imaging system.

## Abstract
A gamma ray scintillation camera generating X, Y spatial coordinate and Z energy signals relative to detected radiation events. The camera signals are converted to their digital equivalents subsequent to which the apparent coordinate locations of detected events as determined by the camera are corrected to their true spatial coordinates based upon correction information stored in the system. In addition to spatial coordinate correction, the system provides for calibration of the camera Z signal response as a function of camera face location.
