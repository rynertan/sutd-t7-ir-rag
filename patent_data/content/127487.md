# Catalyst component for polymerization of olefins.

## Abstract
A catalyst component for the polymerization of olefins and particularly ethylene which is prepared by contacting a contact product of a magnesium alkoxide, a halogenated hyd rocarbon, a halogenated silane with a titanium compound. The catalyst component in combination with a organo aluminum cocatalyst is useful for the polymerization of ethylene having a high melt index.
