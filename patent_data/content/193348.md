# Electrostatic spraying apparatus.

## Abstract
An apparatus and process for spraying liquids wherein means are provided for subjecting liquid emerging from the sprayhead 1 to an electrical field sufficiently high for the liquid to be drawn from the sprayhead in the form of one or more filaments. The filament or filaments become unstable and subsequently break up into droplets. A stream of gas is caused to flow through the region of the high electrical field, the gas flowing in a direction parallel or substantially parallel with the direction in which the liquid emerges from the sprayhead. Droplets are thus removed from the region and a build up in space charge is reduced.
