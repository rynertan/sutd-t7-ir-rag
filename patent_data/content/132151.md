# Method of and apparatus for automatically correcting position of TV camera.

## Abstract
A method of correcting the position of a TV camera 2a, 2b for taking up the image of an object to produce video signals of the image, suitable for use in, for example, automo tive headlamp beam testing system. The images of reference points 10a, 10b which are provided for the purpose of cor recting the TV camera position are taken up by the TV camera 2a, 2b . Then, the position data representing the positions of the reference points 10a, 10b in the field of vision of the TV camera 2a, 2b is determined. The position data are com pared with predetermined reference point data representing the positions of the reference points in the field of vision of the TV camera 2a, 2b as obtained when the TV camera 2a, 2b is in the correct position, thereby determining the amount of deviation of the TV camera 2a, 2b . Then, the driving unit is operated in accordance with the thus determined amount of deviation to adjust the optical axis of said TV camera 2a, 2b so as to eliminate the deviation of the TV camera position. Disclosed also is a method in which the measurement data obtained through the TV camera is corrected in accordance with the amount of deviation of the TV camera, as well as aparatus suitable for carrying out these methods.
