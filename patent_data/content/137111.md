# Process for producing formed articles of aromatic polyamide imide resin.

## Abstract
In a process for producing a formed article of aromatic polyamide imide resin by compression molding at the tem perature lower than the melting temperature of the resin, the improvement which comprises subjecting the resin, prior to the molding, to heat treatment in an oxygen containing gas under conditions satisfying the following equation logt a₁ a₂T a₃T² a₄T³, wherein a₁ 2.5841, a₂ 8.4926 10 ³, a₃ 6.9984 10 ⁶, and a₄ 2.0449 10 ⁸ t and T represent the heat treatment time in hour and the heat treatment tempera ture in C, respectively and 200 C T 400 C.
