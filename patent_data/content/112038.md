## Description
A METHOD OF DRIVING AN ELECTROCHEMICAL DISPLAY DEVICE This invention relates to methods of driving electrochemical display devices. Prussian blue, which is an electrochromic material, changes from a coloured state to a bleached state according to the following electrochemical reaction formula fe III 4 Fe II CN 613 4N 4e blue EMI1.1 M4 Fe II 4 Fe II CN 6 3 .,. 1 clear wherein M is a monovalent cation selected from the group consisting of Li Na , K , Rub , Cos , Nun41 etc. In the above reaction formula the left hand substance is blue in colour and the right hand substance is colourless. These substances undergo an electrochemically reversible redox reaction. In a three electrode electrochemical display device using aPrussian blue coated working electrode, a counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode SCE as a reference electrode, the working electrode is coloured by applying a voltage of about 0.6 volts with respect to the reference electrode and is bleached by applying a voltage of about 0.2 volts with respect to the reference electrode. Figure 3 B is a cyclic voltammogram of aPrussian blue coated working electrode of such a three electrode electrochemical display device, the working electrode being immersed in a 1M KC1 electrolyte solution pH 4.0 . The cyclic voltammagram has a peak of about 0.2 volts with respect to the reference electrode.The cyclic voltammogram shows that colouration of the working electrode is completed at about 0.6 volts relative to the reference electrode and bleaching of the working electrode is completed at about 0.2 volts relative to the reference electrode. It is, however, impossible to incorporate a saturated calomel electrode as a reference electrode in a practical electro chemical display device. A two electrode electrochemical display device consisting of a working electrode and a counter electrode is the most simple and most suitable for practical purposes.However, it is not known how to drive a two electrode electrochemical display device utilizing a Prussian blue coated working electrode and a Prussian blue coated counter electrode. According to the present invention there is provided a method of driving an electrochemical display device comprising a working electrode having a Prussian blue coating thereon, a counter electrode spaced from the working electrode and having a Prussian blue coating thereon, and an electrolyte in contact with the working electrode and the counter electrode, the method being characterised in that a voltage that is greater than a predetermined voltage is applied to the working electrode with respect to the counter electrode in order to cause colouration of the working electrode, and a voltage which is less than the predetermined voltage is applied to the working electrode with respect to the counter electrode in order to cause bleaching of the working electrode, the predetermined voltage being between 0.6 volts and 0.2 volts. In one embodiment a voltage greater than 0.2 volts is applied to the working electrode with respect to the counter electrode in order to cause colouration of the working electrode and a voltage which is less than 0.2 volts is applied to the working electrode with respect to the counter electrode in order to cause bleaching of the working electrode. Alternatively a voltage which is greater than 0.6 volts is applied to the working electrode with respect to the counter electrode in order to cause colouration of the working electrode and a voltage that is smaller than 0.6 volts is applied to the working electrode with respect to the counter electrode in order to cause bleaching of the working electrode. In another embodiment a voltage greater than 0.2 volts is applied to the working electrode with respect to the counter electrode in order to cause colouration of the working electrode and a voltage that is smaller than 0.6 volts is applied to the working electrode with respect to the counter electrode in order to cause bleaching of the working electrode.

Figure 1 shows an electrochemical display device for explaining an embodiment of a method according to the present invention for driving it. A transparent conductive film 2 for instance made of tin IV oxide is formed on a transparent display substrate 1 to act as a display or working electrode. The transparent conductive film is etched in a desired pattern. The regions of the transparent conductive film, other than the regions of lead electrodes and regions to be covered by a Prussian film 4, are coated with an insulating film 3 for instance made of silicon dioxide Si02 . The Prussian blue film 4 is then formed. The Prussian blue film may be formed, for example, by the method disclosed in U.S. PatentApplication Serial No. 387 470. An electrolytic solution is prepared consisting of an aqueous solution of ZOmM Fe C104 3 whose pH is regulated to pE2 by CH104 and an aqueous solution of 2OmM K3Fe CN 6 mixed together in a 1 1 volume ratio. The working electrode is immersed in this electrolytic solution. An electric current of 10 pA cm wis applied to the working electrode so as to deposit the Prussian blue film. The charge density at the working electrode is set at about 9mC cm2. A counter electrode formed on a counter substrate 5 is formed in a similar manner to the working electrode, and like parts of the working electrode and the counter electrode are designated by the same reference numerals. The charge density of the Prussian 2 blue film 4 of the counter electrode is set at 40mC cm . A back ground plate 6 is sandwiched between the display substrate and the counter substrate which are sealed together by a spacer 7.A 1 MKC1 electrolyte solution whose pH is regulated to pH4 by HC1 is disposed between the display substrate and the counter substrate. Figure 2 shows graphically the change in electrode potential of a Prussian blue coated electrode in terms of elapsed time after keeping the potential level of the Prussian blue coated electrode at 0.6 volts for a time with respect to a saturated calomel electrode SCE as a reference electrode in a 1 MKC1 aqueous solution whose pH is regulated to pH4 by EC1 and after terminating the voltage applied to the Prussian blue coated electrode.The Prussian blue coated electrode used had a charge density of 2 14mC cm . The electrode potential of the Prussian blue coated electrode settled to 0.3 volts from about 0.45 volts with respect to the reference electrode after two hours. Figure 3 A is a cyclic voltammogram of a two electrode electrochemical display device and Figure 3 B is a cyclic voltammogram of a conventional three electrode electrochemical display device. The abscissa in Figure 3 A indicates the electrode potential of a Prussian blue coated working electrode with respect to a counter electrode. The abscissa in Figure 3 B indicates the electrode potential of a Prussian blue coated working electrode with respect to a saturated calomel electrode as a reference electrode. In the electrochemical display device the colouration of the Prussian blue coated working electrode is completed at about 0.6 volts with respect to the reference electrode and bleaching is completed at about 0.2 volts with respect to the reference electrode. In a three electrode electrochemical display device, the electrode potential of the working electrode is determined with respect to the reference electrode while in a two electrode electrochemical display device the electrode potential of the working electrode is determined with respect to the counter electrode. The electrode potential of the counter electrode having a Prussian blue coating thereon is considered to be at 0.3 volts to about 0.45 volts with respect to the reference electrode as indicated in Figure 2. When in the electrochemical display device of Figure 1 a voltage of about 0.2 volts, which is given by substituting the electrode potential of the counter electrode with respect to the reference electrode from the electrode potential of the working electrode in the coloured state with respect to the reference electrode, is applied to the working electrode with respect to the counter electrode, the reaction represented by the reaction formula above almost completely goes to the left and the working electrode is coloured blue.When a voltage of about 0.6 volts which is given by substituting the electrode potential of the counter electrode from the electrode potential of the working electrode in the bleached state, is applied to the working electrode with respect to the counter electrode, the reaction represented by the reaction formula above goes to the right and the working electrode becomes colourless. The cyclic voltammogram shown in Figure 3 A illustrates this and the redox reaction has a peak current of about 0.1 volts and colouration is completed at about 0.2 volts and the bleaching is completed at about 0.6 volts. The scan rate of the applied voltage is 2QnV S in the case of Figure 3 A and is 50mV S in the case of Figure 3 B . Figure 4 shows a drive circuit for driving the electrochemical display device of Figure 1. The counter electrode is connected to ground potential. Variable resistors 10 are connected in parallel across two direct current power supplies 9 respectively so that any given voltage can be developed by the resistors 10.The output voltages of the two power supplies 9 are selectively connected to the working electrode through a switch 11. The switch 11 operates to switch between the coloured state and the bleached state of the working electrode. Figure 5 shows a preferred embodiment of the waveform of a drive signal applied to the electrochemical display device ofFigure 1 by a method according to the present invention.A voltage of 0.2 volts is applied to the working electrode for causing colouration thereof and a voltage of 0.6 volts is applied to the working electrode for causing bleaching thereof. to denotes the time interval during which the drive voltage is applied to the working electrode and which may be set at various values. Figure 6 shows graphically change of an electric current and change of electric charge observed at the working electrode in response to the voltage of the drive signal which is initially held at 0.2 volts for colouring the working electrode. The size of the 2 working electrode used in this case was 4mm and the electric charge density of the working electrode was 8mC cm . Response time is defined by the time interval for moving 90 of the total electric charge to or from the working electrode. The response time is about 0.6 seconds for bleaching the working electrode and about 0.9 seconds for colouring the working electrode.Figure 7 shows the relationship between the stability of a Prussian blue film which is measured by the retention of the Prussian blue film and a number of drive cycles where the drive signal is so arranged that a voltage of 0.2 volts is applied for 2 seconds to cause colouration of the working electrode and then a voltage of 0.6 volts is applied for 2 seconds to cause bleaching of the working electrode and then this set of drive voltages are repeated.The retention of the film is defined as The retention of the film charge of Prussian blue film after predetermined number of drive cycles Initial charge of Prussian blue film 1 The retention of the Prussian blue film indicates the reduced charge of the Prussian blue film after a predetermined number of drive cycles with respect to the intial charge The retention of the film indicates the degree of deterioration of the Prussian blue film. In Figure 7 a circle indicates a mean value of 20 test cells. The vertical line passing through the circles indicates the maximum value and the minimum value. Even after 5 10 cycles the test cells were found to operate stably. Another embodiment of a method according to the present invention for driving an electrochemical display device of the previous embodiment will be described. A voltage of 0 volts is applied to the working electrode with respect to the counter electrode for causing colouration of the working electrode and a voltage of 0.4 volts is applied to the working electrode with respect to the counter electrode for causing bleaching of the working electrode. Figure 8 shows the relationship between the voltage applied to the working electrode with respect to the counter electrode and 9 value.The a value is defined by the following equation q 8 QVo 6 x 100 2 O.6 where QVo is the charge flowing through the working electrode when the applied voltage is changed from 0.2 volts to Vo volts and, Q 0.6 is the charge flowing through the working electrode when the applied voltage is changed from 0.2 volts to 0.6 volts. According to equation 2 when the voltage of 0.2 volts is applied to the working electrode and thus the reaction formula above goes completely to the left the g value is 0 . When a voltage of 0.6 volts is applied to the working electrode and thus the reaction formula goes completely to the right and the working electrode is colourless the g is 100 . Thus the g value indicates the degree of the reaction rate from left to right in the reaction formula. The q value is 158 when a voltage of 0 volts is applied to the working electrode for causing colouration of the working electrode. The 5 value is 95 when a voltage of 0.4 volts is applied to the working electrode for bleaching the working electrode.In this state the working electrode is not completely colourless but clear enough for practical operation of an electrochemical display device even at a voltage of 0.4 volts. Another embodiment of a method according to the present invention utilises the same electrochemical display device as shown in Figure 4. This electrochemical display device is driven by a colouring voltage of 0.3 volts and a bleaching voltage of 0.4 volts. As seen from Figure 8, the reaction formula goes to the left when a voltage of 003 volts is applied to the working electrode as well as the voltage of 0.2 volts. When a voltage of 0.4 volts is applied to the working electrode the 9 value is 95 .Thus the working electrode is not completely colourless but is sufficiently clear for practical purposes. A yet further embodiment according to the present invention utilises the electrochemical display device of Figure 4.A colouring voltage of 0 volts and a bleaching voltage of 0.7 volts are applied to the working electrode so as to drive the electrochemical display device. when the colouring voltage is 0 volts, the g value is about 15 . When the bleaching voltage is 0.7 volts the g value is 100 . Thus the working electrode is completely colourless in the bleached state and fully coloured in the coloured state. The methods according to the present invention and described above enable a two electrode electrochemical display device which consists of a Prussian blue coated working electrode and aPrussian blue coated counter electrode to be stably driven so that a relatively long operational life is achieved. the structure of the electrochemical display device is relatively simple because the same electrochomic material is used for both the working electrode and the counter electrode.
