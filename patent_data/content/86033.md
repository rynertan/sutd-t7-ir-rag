# Circuitry for controlling a CRT beam.

## Abstract
Beam characteristics, including writing speed, slope, position and intensity, are controlled by circuitry which includes a single digital to analog converter 210 sample and hold circuitry 250, 260, 270 and a pair of active integrator circuits 280, 290 . A microprocessor is adapted to control these circuit components. A data multiplexer 230 selectively applies the DAC output to a preselected sample and hold circuit means. The microprocessor is operative to provide digital words to the DAC representative of the differential X and Y values of a line segment to be drawn. The analog representations of these digital words are coupled to the integrators. The outputs of the active integrators provide the deflection signals causing deflection of the CRT beam. The apparatus is particularly adapted to drawing a series of connected line segments, due to the integrator operation. A line segment length may be scaled simply by varying the time interval the analog signals are applied to the integrators, while the writing speed remains constant. The apparatus can also be adapted to display a pseudo raster scan field.
