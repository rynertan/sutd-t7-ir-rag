## Description
RE USABLE FILTER UNITS WITH RECOVERABLE FILTER MEMBRANESDESCRIPTION The present invention relates to filtration units for laboratory use and is more particularly concerned with re usable filtration units having recoverable filter membranes. A variety of re usable filter units are known in the art and are used in various laboratory operations where a sample of a liquid is filtered through a filter membrane. The filter membrane is then recovered so that the material collected on the membrane can be inspected or cultured, for instance. Briefly, such re usable units generally include an upper body for receiving the liquid to be filtered, a lower body for receiving the filtrate, an intermediate member for supporting the filter membrane and some means for locking these three components together and providing an air tight seal about the filter membrane. Filtration units of the prior art employ various means for releasably assembling and locking the upper and lower bodies together. For example, in one version, the two bodies are threaded, so that one may be screwed into the other. Bayonet locks are also employed and still another version has the mating ends of the upper and lower bodies provided with magnets for holding them together. In bayonet joint and screw threaded attachments and to some extent in magnetic attachments , one of the bodies must be rotated or twisted with respect to the other in order to assemble or disassemble the filter unit. Such an arrangement is not entirely satisfactory, as relative rotation, caused by moving one or another of the bodies during assembly or disassembly, may twist, bend or even tear the filter membrane. Damage to the membrane during assembly of the filter unit can result in poor filtration. Damage occurring during disassembly to remove the membrane can result in loss of some portion of the material filtered from the liquid.For these reasons, it is important and preferable for the upper and lower body members to be assembled in a manner which avoids application of a shearing or twisting force to the filter membrane and also for the filter membrane to be inserted and recovered in as flat a condition as possible. Another disadvantage of known filter units is that the filter membrane is not easily removed from its support plate, particularly when the membrane has been firmly pressed against this plate, such as during vacuum filtration. For example, in some prior art units, the membrane support plate is fixed to the lower body and no provision is made for inserting a tool between the membrane and the support plate to facilitate peeling the membrane from the plate. In other prior art units, the support plate is removably located in a recess in either the upper or the lower body, which makes it difficult to separate the filter support plate from the surrounding structure The present invention provides an improved form of re usable filter unit which can be used readily without causing the disadvantages mentioned. According to this invention, a re usable filter unit is provided, having a recoverable filter membrane, comprising an upper body with a lower outlet, for receiving liquid to be filtered, a lower body comprising a receptacle for filtrate and a liquid permeable support for locating the filter membrane between the upper and lower bodies, characterized in that the upper body has a dependent flange about its outlet, the lower body has an upstanding collar defining an open top, the support comprises a perforated plate releasably carried by the collar, a connector member is provided for engaging the flange and the collar and for drawing the upper and lower bodies together without relative rotation so that the plate is clamped between the collar and an internal shoulder upon the flange, the shoulder having an inside diameter less than the outside diameter of the plate, a seal member being associated with the collar, the shoulder and the plate for providing an air tight seal between them when assembled ready for use. In the unit of the present invention, the upper and lower body members of the filter unit are drawn axially together without rotating one member with respect to the other. Connecting the upper and lower body members together in this way clamps the support plate for the filter membrane between the two members. In a preferred embodiment, the support plate rests on a collar and has an outside diameter which is larger than the collar so that, when the filter unit is disassembled, the support plate can be lifted manually from the collar, e.g.for inspection or removal of the filter membrane.Provision is also made for inserting a tool beneath the filter membrane, to facilitate its removal from the support plate. In order that the invention may be fully understood, two preferred embodiments of filter units are described below by way of illustration in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 shows an elevational view of one form of filter unit of the invention Figure 2 shows a side elevational view on an enlarged scale, partly broken away and in section, of a portion of the filter unit shown in Figure 1 Figure 3 shows a view similar to Figure I of another embodiment of the invention. Figure 1 of the drawings shows a re usable filter unit 10 according to the present invention, which includes a reservoir or upper body 12, for receiving a quantity of the liquid to be filtered, releasably joined to a receptacle or lower body 14 for receiving the filtrate. For convenience, both the upper and lower bodies 12, 14 are cylindrical and are made of an autoclavable and preferably transparent material, such as polycarbonate or polysulphone. Filter units commonly used in the art typically range in size up to 500 mL and have a filter membrane diameter of up to 50 mL. It is also common to employ vacuum to aid in drawing the liquid through the filter membrane, shown at 46 in Fig. 2, and for this purpose, the lower body 14 is provided with a port 17 for connection to a vacuum line not shown . As shown in Figure 2, the lower body 14 has an annular collar generally indicated at 18. The lower portion 20 of this collar 18 has the largest diameter and is provided with an external screw thread 22. The uppermost portion 24 of the collar 18 has the smallest diameter and releasably carries a filter membrane support plate 16. This plate 16 is further described below. The intermediate portion 28 of the collar 18 has an outside diameter which is between the diameters of the respective lower and upper portions 20, 24. The upper body 12 has a necked portion 30. Depending from this necked portion is a split flange 32.The lower end of the split flange 32 has an external shoulder 34 which captures a locking ring 36 having an internal screw thread 40. Axial slots 38 provided about the split flange 32 permit contraction of the flange 32, so that the locking ring 36 may be pushed over the shoulder 34. When the flange 32 is allowed to expand back to its original configuration, the shoulder 34 captures the locking ring 36, as shown in Figure 2. With this arrangement, the locking ring 36 can rotate with respect to the split flange 32 so that, when the locking ring 36 is threaded on to the lower portion 20 of the collar 18, the upper and lower bodies 12, 14 are drawn axially together without relative rotation. If desired, axial ribs 26 can be moulded upon the intermediate portion 28 so as to align with the axial slots 38. The engagement of these ribs 26 with the slots 38 ensures that no twisting or rotation of the upper and lower bodies 12, 14 occurs as they are drawn together. Formed integrally with the necked portion 30 is an internal shoulder 42, which serves to clamp the support plate 16 against the upper collar portion 24 when the upper and lower bodies 12, 14 are drawn axially together. The support plate 16 has on its upper surface a plurality of upstanding projections 44. These projections 44 are spaced close together and provide support for the filter membrane 46 resting on and extending over the support plate 16. The spaces 48 between the projections 44 communicate with one another and so channel liquid passing through the filter membrane 46 to the central portion of the support plate 16. This central portion is provided with through openings 50 to permit the filtrate to fall into the lower body or receptacle 14. Disposed about the outer periphery of the support plate 16 is an upstanding wall 52. This wall 52 increases the overall thickness of the support plate 16 so as to facilitate manual grasping and lifting of the support plate 16 from the collar 18. Because this wall 52 surrounds the filter membrane 46, it is provided with several spaced openings 54 to facilitate removal of the filter membrane 46 from the support plate 16. In this respect, the openings 54 permit a user to insert tweezers or some other appropriate device into one of the spaces 48 beneath the filter membrane 46 in order to lift the membrane from the support plate 16. The under surface of the support plate 16 is provided with an annular groove 56 for receiving an Oring or other appropriate gasket 58. This gasket 58 provides a seal between the support plate 16 and the upper edge of the uppermost collar portion 24. Completing the structure of the filter unit 10, as Figure 2 shows, the internal shoulder 42 is also provided with an annular groove 60 for receiving an O ring or other appropriate gasket 62. This gasket 62 seats against the upper surface of the support plate 16 to provide an air tight seal between the plate 16 and the upper body 12. In use, the filter membrane 46 is placed on the support plate 16. The plate 16 and its gasket 58 are then located on the upper edge of the collar portion 24.To assemble the unit 10, the upper body 12 is simply placed on top of the collar 18 and the locking ring 36 is threaded on to the lower collar portion 20. Tightening the locking ring 36 draws the upper body portion 12 axially toward the lower body portion 14, so the internal shoulder 42 and its gasket 62 are pressed against the filter membrane 46 and the support plate 16 in order to clamp the support plate 16 against the upper edge of the collar portion 24. Since the upper body 12 is not rotated with respect to the filter membrane 46, the joining of the two body portions 12, 14 does not result in bending, folding, twisting or tearing of the membrane 46. Also, as the upper body portion 12 is tightened down against the lower body portion 14, the intermediate collar portion 28 extends into the split flange 32 and engages the inside surface of the flange 32.This engagement acts to provide a radial bearing support to prevent inward deflection of the split flange 32 and possible separation of the locking ring 36 from the shoulder 34 as the locking ring is tightened. The liquid to be filtered is then placed in the upper body portion 12 and a vacuum line not shown is attached to the port 17 for evacuating the lower body portion 14. The seals provided by the gaskets 58 and 62 ensure that only liquid from the upper body portion 12 is drawn through the filter membrane 46 and that no air enters the lower body portion 14 around the internal shoulder 42 or over the collar 18. When filtration is complete, the locking ring 36 is unscrewed and the body portion 12 is lifted from the collar 18. This exposes the entire outer periphery of the support plate 16, so that it can be manually grasped and removed. The material filtered from the liquid can then be examined or, if desired, the membrane 46 can be removed as described above, e.g. for microscopic examination or culturing of the material filtered from the liquid. Should the user desire to recover only the filtrate collected in the lower body 14, this can be done without disassembly simply by pouring out the filtrate through the port 17. A second port 19 Figure 1 formed on the other side of the lower body 14, normally closed during filtration, is opened so as to act as an air vent to allow quick discharge of the filtrate. In addition, the wall of the lower body portion 14 can be provided with a recess as shown at 76 to facilitate recovery of the filtrate by chanelling it to the port 17. Referring now to Figure 3, another embodiment of the invention is shown, where many of the components of the filter unit are similar to those shown in Figure 2. Accordingly, the same reference numerals have been used where the parts referred to are the same as inFigure 2. In the Figure 1 embodiment, as shown in Figure 2, the lower body 14 has the upstanding collar 18 but, in this embodiment, the upper and intermediate portions 24 and 28 of the collar have the same outside diameter.Accordingly, supporting contact for the split flange 32 is provided over a greater portion of the length of the split flange 32 as compared to the Figure 2 embodiment. Thus, the construction of the Figure 3 embodiment provides greater radial support for the split flange 32 than does the embodiment shown in Figure 2. Formed about the inside diameter of the collar portion 24 are a plurality of support ribs 64 for receiving the support plate 16. In this respect, the outside diameter of the plate 16, in this embodiment, is less than the inside diameter of the collar 24,28, so the plate 16 is supported within the collar on the ribs 64. Also, in the Figure 3 embodiment, the upper surface of the plate 16 is recessed at its outer edge, so that the filter membrane 46 resting on the plate 26 overhangs the upper surface, as shown at 68. When the support plate 16 is removed from the filter unit 10, this construction allows the operator to insert one prong of a pair of tweezers or other suitable device beneath the edge of the filter membrane 46, in order to lift the membrane easily from the support plate 16. In order to provide a seal between the support plate 16, the upper collar portion 24 and the split flange 32, the internal shoulder 42 of the upper body 12 extends inwardly from the flange 32 and has a downwardly turned lip 69. The space between this lip 69 and the flange 32 provides a seat for a gasket member 70 having a radial cross section which is generally H shaped. With a gasket of this form, one edge or leg 72 of the gasket 70 forms a seal between the flange 32 and the plate 16, while the other edge or leg 74 of the H section gasket 70 forms a seal between the shoulder 32 and the upper edge of the collar portion 24. While the embodiment shown in Figure 3 provides an alternative to that shown in Figure 2, it is not preferred because the recessed portion of the support plate 16 makes it more difficult to remove the plate from the collar 18. In the Figure 2 embodiment, however, the support plate 16 merely rests on the upper edge of the collar portion 24, which makes it very easy simply to grasp and lift the support plate 16 from the collar 18. To facilitate manufacture, the collar 18 and the lower body 14 can be made separately as by injection moulding, the port 17 being made integral with the collar 18, as shown in the drawings. The lower body portion 14 can then be attached to the collar 18 so as to form an integral unit, by any suitable joining technique such as sonic welding. In this way, the lower body portion 14 can be made in several configurations or sizes and then joined to a standard collar portion. In any event, it should be appreciated that the invention provides a re usable filter unit which greatly facilitates recovery of the filter membrane. The invention also reduces the risk of damage to the membrane when assembling the unit for use or when disassembling the unit to recover the membrane.
