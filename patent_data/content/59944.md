# Method and apparatus for handling printed sheet material.

## Abstract
A skeleton wheel or cylinder for supporting freshly printed sheet material between printing stations or at the delivery station of a printing press is provided with a loosely retained ink repellant fabric covering 32 for supporting and conveying the sheet material without transfer of wet ink from one sheet to a successive sheet and without smearing the ink or indenting the surface of the sheet material. The circum ferential surface of the skeleton cylinder is provided with a coating 35 of a fluorocarbon plastic having a fabric base portion bonded to the surface of the cylinder structure. The low friction properties of the coating permit ease of shuffling movement of the fabric covering and the coating structure provides a cushioning effect to prevent smearing or inde nting the sheet material by the fabric cover. The improved cylinder is provided with a plurality of retaining plates slidably fitted in axially spaced hub portions of the cylinder which plates are each locked in place by a set screw. The rim portion of the cylinder includes opposed parallel flanges 22, 24 on which the opposite ends of the fabric covering may be removably retained.
