# High speed plating apparatus.

## Abstract
A high speed plating apparatus in which a holder 20 has its surface prevented from being electrolytically plated partly by holding a work 18 and partly by coating the surface of an electrode 2 with an electrically insulating material 40 thereby to attain a reliable and smooth operation. A metal cylinder 14 of platinum can be fitted into the interior of the electrode, which faces a plating chamber 6 for improving the wear resistance of the inner walls of said electrode.
