## Description
COMPOSITIONS This invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing polyvinylpyrrolidone iodine complex, to a process for their preparation and their use as topical disinfectant. Polyvinylpyrrolidone iodine complex, also referred to as povidone iodine see Martindale, the ExtraPharmacopoeia, 27th Ed., p 830 is a well known topical disinfectant. It has antifungal, antibacterial, antiprotazoal and antiviral activity. It has been used for many years usually as an ointment for the prevention and treatment of topical infections, including wound infections. A well known polyvinylpyrrolidoneiodine ointment is that sold under the name BETAISODONA or BETADINE BETAISODONA and BETADINE are RegisteredTrade Marks . The disadvantage of known compositions containing polyvinylpyrrolidone iodine complex is that they are dark brown and, when applied topically, visibly discolour the skin or mucosa. Some patients find this discolouration and the dark colour of the compositions so distasteful that they fail to comply with prescribed treatment. Although the development of polyvinylpyrrolidoneiodine complex compositions that do not discolour the skin and that do not have a dark brown colour has been long recognised as desirable, no practical solution to this discolouration problem has previously been proposed.The addition of white pigment to known polyvinyl pyrrolidone compositions which have aqueous carriers has little or no effect on their colour. According to the present invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising particulate polyvinylpyrrolidone iodine complex dispersed in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier as Åa continuous phase from which the complex is released when the composition is applied topically, the composition having a colour falling within the region described by the following equation 2 2 2 1.4879R1 0.029495Y1 5 066B1 0.34806R1Y1 5.3486R1B1 0.54292Y1B1 1 where R1 Lovibond Red 4.3111 yl Lovibond Yellow 6 2167 B1 Lovibond Blue 1.8833 The above equation expresses the range of colours for the compositions of the invention using the Lovibond scale.This scale expresses a colour as a combination of three primary colours red, yellow and blue. The colour is measured on the Lovibond scale using a LovibondTintometer. The equation above is derived empirically by measuring the colours of a range of compositions. The compositions described by this equation vary in colour from white through buff to deep tan. Compositions where the colour falls within the region described by the equation 2 2 2 1.9946 R2 0.061339 Y2 6.3034B2 0.599R2Y2 6.9148R2B2 0.92198Y2B2 where R2 Lovibond Red 3.9000 Y2 t Lovibond Yellow 5.0375 B2 r Lovibond Blue 1.7187 vary in colour from white through buff to mid tan. Compositions where the colour falls within the region described by the equation 2 2 2 2.0761R3 0.1037Y3 6.449B23 7.0766R3B3 0.9375Y3B3 1 where R3 Lovibond Red 3.5071 Y3 Lovibond Yellow 4.0143 B3 Lovibond Blue 1.5786 vary in colour from white through buff to light tan. Compositions falling within the region described by the equation 3.7767R2 0.31564Y2 8.0868B2 1.32686R4Y4 4 4 4 4 10.4804R4B4 1.65Y4B4 1 where R4 Lovibond Red 4.4571 Y4 Lovibond Yellow 5.7571 B4 Lovibond Blue 1.9643 vary in colour from buff to light tan. Preferably the compositions fall within the region described by the equation 6.8076R2 0.62875Y2 12.2729B2 3.0476R5Y5 5 5 5 5 5 17.5926R5B5 3.1056Y5B5 1 where R5 Lovibond Red 3.9750 Y5 Lovibond Yellow 4.4125 B5 Lovibond Blue 1.7750These compositions are buff coloured. In the above equations Lovibond Red, Lovibond Yellow and Lovibond Blue mean the Red, Yellow and Blue values measured for a composition of the invention on theLovibond scale. The advantage of the compositions of this invention is that they are of a relatively light colour and discolouration is diminished. In particular compositions having the colour values above comprise particulate polyvinylpyrrolidone iodine complex of which less than 10 by weight has a particle size less than 10 microns, and a light coloured pigment, dispersed in a substantially anhydrous pharmaceuticallyacceptable carrier from which complex is released when the composition is applied topically and in which the complex is substantially insoluble. In practice less than 10 by weight of the complex has a particle size greater than 150 microns. Preferably less than 10 by weight of the complex has a particle size greater than 100 microns. For example 80 by weight of the particulate complex has a particle size in the range 10 50 microns. Preferably 90 by weight of the particulate complex has a particle size in the range 20 80 microns. The compositions of the invention contain an effective amount of polyvinylpyrrolidine iodine complex.Typically, this is from 2 to 20 by weight of the composition. In particular it is 10 by weight. Preferably the compositions contain a buffer so that their pH is from 3.5 to 5.0. The pH is determined by shaking a sample of the composition with an equal volume of water and measuring the pH of the water . Examples of buffers which can be used in the compositions of this invention are sodium acetate, disodium hydrogen phosphate and trisodium phosphate. Substantially anhydrous herein means that the carrier contains not more than 3 by weight of water as measured by the Karl Fischer method. Preferably the maximum water content is less than 1 . In particular it can be 0.5 . By a carrier which releases complex when applied topically is meant that on administration the carrier releases the complex to which has been applied. This can be demonstrated in vitro by testing a sample of the composition for antibacterial activity on an agar plate. By a carrier in which the polyvinylpyrrolidoneiodine complex is substantially insoluble is meant that the solubility of the complex in the carrier is less than 0.75 by weight. Preferably the carrier is one where the solubility of the complex is less than by weight. It is of course understood that the carrier is substantially inert to iodine from the polyvinylpyrrolidone iodine complex, by which it is meant that the carrier has an iodine value of not more than 2. Preferably the iodine value of the carriers is less than 1. Examples of substances which can be used as carriers in the compositions of this invention are high boiling liquid paraffins and petroleum jellies, higher fatty alcohols and carboxylic acid esters. An example of a high boiling liquid paraffin is liquid paraffin B.P. An example of a petroleum jelly is soft white paraffin B.P. Examples of higher fatty alcohols are C10 C20 fatty alcohols, especially dodecanol lauryl alcohol , tetradecanol myristyl alcohol , hexadecanol cetyl alcohol , octadecanol stearyl alcohol and an example of a common mixture of such alcohols is cetostearyl alcohol. The carboxylic acid ester can be an ester of a fatty acid and a fatty alcohol, or a fatty acid mono , di , or triglycerider or a mixture of such compounds. Where the ester is of a fatty acid and fatty alcohol, preferably it contains a total of from 9 to 25 carbon atoms. Thus the fatty alcohol ester containing the smallest number of carbon atoms is octanyl acetate and the fatty acid containing the smallest number of carbon atoms ester is methyl octanoate. Where the ester is a triglyceride, each fatty acid residue has at least. 3 and at most 20 carbon atoms. The di and tri glycerides can be simple, that is, all the fatty acids in the glyceride are the same, or complex, that is, each glycerine contains two or more different fatty acids. Preferably the carrier is an emulsifying carrier which in particular can form an emulsion on contact with an aqueous medium e.g. water or serum at the interface between the carrier and the medium. The bioavailability of polyvinylpyrrolidone iodine complex from a composition for example an ointment, can be demonstrated quantitatively in the following test A quantity of a composition lg is weighed out accurately into a measured volume 30ml of physiological salt 0.9 sodium chloride , and the mixture is shaken for from 0.5 to 5.0 min. The mixture is centrifuged 2 min 3000rpm , and an aliquot 20ml of, the supernatant liquid is withdrawn and titrated with 0.01 N sodium thiosulphate. U.V. spectroscopic studies show that polyvinylpyrrolidone iodine complex is liberated quantitatively so that the measure of available iodine U.S.P. XX, NF XV p 647 in the above tests is a measure of complex liberated from the composition. The above test shows that an ointment consisting of 10 by weight of polyvinylpyrrolidone iodine complex and 3 by weight df titanium dioxide dispersed in a triglyceride releases almost 100 of the complex. Preferably the carrier is one which can liberate at least 80 of the complex and in particular at least 50 of the complex. The emulsifying carrier can be a substance having a hydrophile lipophile balance such that it can form an emulsion or a mixture of substances for example a surfactant and a substance of high lipophilicity such that the mixture has a hydrophile lipophile balance such that the mixture can form an emulsion. Examples of substances which form emulsions are higher fatty alcohols, fatty acid esters and mono , di , and triglycerides and mixtures thereof. Examples of substances of high lipophilicity which form emulsions when mixed with a surfactant are petroleum jellies and high boiling liquid paraffins. The surfactant can be selected in accordance with normal procedure for making emulsions. Thus the surfactant will be miscible with substance of high lipophilicity.It will also of course be substantially inert to iodine, that is, the carrier containing the surfactant will have an iodine value of less than 2. The surfactant can be one of those substances listed above as being able.to form emulsions for example a mono , or di glyceride, a higher fatty alcohol especially cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol and cetostearyl alcohol or a non ionic polyethyleneoxy surfactant. The carrier can also contain minor amounts of other constituents which are standard in topical pharmaceutical formulations, for example softeners, thickeners, suspension stabilizers, stiffeners and emollients. Examples of softeners are C14 alkyl esters of dodecanoic lauric and tetradecanoic myristic acid, especially isopropyl myristate. An example of a suspension stabiliser is bentonite. Examples of thickeners are silica gels and silica aerosols. Examples of stiffeners are hexadecanol cetyl alcohol , octadecanol stearyl alcohol , cetostearyl alcohol and hard white paraffin. Examples of emollients are hexadecanol and isopropyl myristate. Preferably the carrier consists essentially of a triglyceride that is the triglyceride is at least 60 by weight of the carrier with minor proportions of a surfactant and or the other constituents referred to above. Preferably the triglyceride has a melting point of 30 600C. In particular when the composition is an ointment, the triglyceride can have a melting point of 34 400C and when the composition is a pessary the triglyceride has a melting point of 34 420C. The compositions of this invention can also contain a light coloured pigment which lightens the colour of the composition to the required tint. For example the pigment can be, white, preferably it is an insoluble inorganic pigment especially a white metal oxide or sulphate, for example, titanium dioxide, zirconium dioxide or barium sulphate. Preferably it is titanium dioxide. The advantage of titanium dioxide is that it has a particularly strong whitening effect in the compositions of the invention and can be used in small amounts. When the pigment is titanium dioxide, preferably the titanium dioxide content is 0.5 at least by weight of composition. In particular the content can be from 1, 2 or 3 by weight. In practice the maximum content is not greater than 30 by weight. In particular the content can be up to 20 or 25 by weight. For example the content can be 2, 5 or 10 by weight. Typically the compositions of the invention are in a form suitable for topical administration. For example the composition can be in the form of a lotion or an ointment for application to the skin, a spreadable cosmestic stick for example a lipstick or a pessary. In an ointment of this invention the carrier typically consists of a petroleum jelly or triglyceride, an emulsifying agent and a softening agent. In a pessary composition of this invention, typically the carrier consists of a triglyceride, an emulsifying agent and a stiffener. The carrier in a cosmetic stick of this invention typically consists of a triglyceride, an emulsifying agent, a stiffener and a thickener. The compositions of this invention can be prepared by mixing the particulate polyvinylpyrrolidone iodine complex, with the carrier and any pigment that is to be included, and optionally forming the composition into a shape. The particulate complex can be mixed with a pigment and this complex pigment mixture can be mixed with the carrier the complex, a pigment and carrier can be mixed simultaneously or pigment can be added to a mixture of complex and carrier. Where the composition is a pessary or cosmetic stick, it is formed into a shape. This can be done by moulding that is, molten composition is poured into a, mould and allowed to cool . Polyvinylpyrrolidone iodine complex of the particle size required can be prepared by milling commercially available material and passing it through screens. The compositions of the invention can be used to treat topical infections in the same way as known polyvinylpyrrolidone iodine compositions. The invention also provides a method of treating a topical infection which comprises administering topically an effective amount of a composition of the invention to an infected area of a patient.
