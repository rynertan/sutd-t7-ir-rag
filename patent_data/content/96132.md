# Injection molding method and apparatus.

## Abstract
A method for injection molding a material comprises bringing the interior of a tightly sealed injection mold under a high vacuum, then injecting the material into the interior of the injection mold at an ultrahigh speed in the vicinity of a speed at which adiabatic change is exerted on the material in accordance with a predetermined pattern of internal press ure so as to fill the interior of the injection mold with the material, and molding the material under low pressure. An injection molding apparatus used for carrying out the aforementioned method is capable of bringing the interior of the injection mold to a state under a high vacuum.
