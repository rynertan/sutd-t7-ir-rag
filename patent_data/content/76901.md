# INTERACTIVE DISPLAY TERMINAL WITH ALTERNATING DATA PROCESSING AND TEXT PROCESSING SESSIONS WITH TEXT PROCESSING STATUS LINE OPERABLE DURING DATA PROCESSING SESSION

## Abstract
A display word processor 11 has the capability of emulating a data processing terminal for a host data processor 10 in an information processing system. With such a capability, the display word processor may be switched between data processing and word or text processing sessions. In this information processing system, the interactive display 17 is operable during data process ing sessions to display a word processing message when a word processing task is being carried out as a background task during the data processing session. The word process ing message may be displayed on a message line which may be shared with a data processing message. Alter natively, it the interactive display terminal 17 is large enough, the word processing message line may be display ed in an area dedicated to the word processing message.
