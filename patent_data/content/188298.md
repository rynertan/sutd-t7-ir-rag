# Process for preparing purified solid benzoic acid.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a process for preparing purified, virtually odourless, solid benzoic acid obtained from toluene by oxidation with a gas containing molecular oxygen, by means of a treatment using an inert gas or gas mixture, wherein the benzoic acid to be purified is supplied in a liquid state to fluid or spouted bed granulator in which the prevailing temperature is below the solidification tempera ture of the benzoic acid and in which the benzoic acid is treated, during and possibly after the granulating process, with the said gas or gas mixture, the impurities present being taken up in whole or in part in the gas or gas mixture, upon which the benzoic acid thus purified is removed from the fluid or spouted bed device.
