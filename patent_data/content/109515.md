# WATER TOLERANT LUBRICANT COMPOSITION

## Abstract
Lubricants are provided which are capable of tolerating substantial amounts of dissolved water without significant loss of lubricating and load bearing properties. These lubri cants comprise water soluble polymers and copolymers of alkylene oxides, i.e., polyoxyalkylene glycols, typically con taining at least about 20 by weight of ethylene oxide.
