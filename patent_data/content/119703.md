# Improved package for oil containing products.

## Abstract
An improved package for an oil containing product is made from a multiple layer packaging sheet material which has reduced propensity to cockling. The multiple layer sheet material includes a layer or layers 22, 24 susceptible to swelling when in contact with oil thus giving a cockled ap pearance. Such an appearance is, however, guarded against because the sheet material also includes a layer 20 which impedes penetration of oil, the impeding layer being interposed between the oil containing product and the oil susceptible layer. The impeding layer comprises po lypropylene, a blend rich in polypropylene or a propylene rich copolymer.
