## Description
SPECIFICATIONTITLE OF THE INVENTION MAGNETIC HEAD AND METHOD OF PRODUCING THE SAME BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a magnetic head suitable for use in combination with a magnetic recording medium with high coercive force such as a metallic tape. More particularly, the present invention relates to a magnetic head and method of producing a magnetic head which head is used while mounted to a rotary magnetic head device of a video tape recorder of a helically scanning type and is suitably used as a rotary erase head for erasing each video track prior to the video track during recording. Home video tape recorders have been made remarkably compact in recent years and so called 8 mm video has been put on the market as an example of such compact home video tape recorders. The 8 mm video is a video tape recorder integrated with a video camera which can record and reproduce for as long as 90 to 120 minutes by use of a compact cassette whose size is equivalent to that of an audio compact cassette. The fundamental mechanism of the 8 mm video consists of a rotary two head system in the same way as in conventional VHS system home video tape recorders. The main characteristic feature of the 8 mm video lies in its video tape, and a metallic tape as a recording medium with high coercive force is introduced.The use of this metallic tape realizes long period recording and reproduction using the compact cassette equivalent to the audio compact cassette and can provide picture quality comparable to the picture quality in the long play mode of conventional home video tape recorders. Since the 8 mm video includes the video camera as described above, shooting with video camera is possible. An edit function is important for this shooting with camera and an erase head or heads are necessary for phase match editing. A fixed head and a rotary head can be used, in principle, as the erase head. However, the fixed erase head involves the following problems. Since change over erasing of a diagonal scanning pattern for each field is not possible, a triangular unerased portion occurs on the tape pattern and double recording by new signals deteriorates the picture quality. Furthermore, the fixed erase head increases a tape load and the number of necessary components in a tape travelling path increases. For these reasons, the fixed erase head is not suitable for a compact video tape recorder. In order to make the most of the characterizing feature of the 8 mm video and to enjoy shooting with video camera, therefore, it is preferred to use a rotary erase head which can be mounted to a rotary magnetic head device. Generally, magnetic alloy members are suitable as the material for this erase head because the metallic tape ordinarily has high coercive force of above 1,000 Oe oersteds . However, since the magnetic alloy member has low wear resistance, a practical head can not be obtained by this magnetic alloy member alone. On the other hand, a magnetic tape having a structure such as shown in Figs. 1 and 2 has been proposed as a magnetic tape for recording and reproducing video signals which is suitable for the metallic tape. Main cores 3a and 3b define an X shape on the tape abrasion surface of the head as shown in the drawings, and a function gap 4 is formed at the cross portion at the center of these cores. Subcores la and lb each having a V shaped projection 2a, 2b are coupled to both sides of the main core. The sub cores consist of ferrite. The main and sub cores together constitute a magnetic circuit for the magnetic head. Reference numeral 5 represents coupling glass that is filled into the Vshaped recesses that are defined by the X shaped main cores 3a and 3b. The magnetic head described above is characterized in that the metallic tape is effectively magnetized with a short recording wavelength and magnetic recording in a high frequency region becomes possible. However, this prior art does not pay any consideration in order to apply the magnetic head to a magnetic head having a gap length of at least 1 wm which is suitable for the erase function. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide a magnetic head and method of producing the same which head is suitable for a metallic tape and having a wide head function gap suitable for erasing information signals video signals recorded on the magnetic tape. In order to accomplish the object described above, the present invention extends a gap forming member, which forms a function gap of a main core made of a magnetic alloy, in a direction of the front surface of the head, and sets the width of the function gap so as to exceed at least the wavelength of an erase signal. In accordance with the present invention, there is obtained a magnetic head suitable for erasing a magnetic tape with high coercive force such as a metallic tape. In accordance with the present invention, furthermore, excessive abrasion of coupling glass having low wear resistance can be prevented because a gap forming member having high wear resistance is extended over the entire width of the tape contact surface of the head. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figs. 1 and 2 are perspective views of a conventional magnetic head Fig. 3 is a perspective view showing a magnetic head in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention Figs. 4 a to 4 h are schematic sectional views each showing step wise the production method of the magnetic head Figs. 5 and 6 are front views showing some application examples of the magnetic head shown in Fig. 3 Fig 7 is a perspective view showing the magnetic head in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention Figs. 8 a to 8tic and Fig. 9 are perspective views showing the magnetic heads in accordance with other embodiments of the present invention and Figs. 10 to 12 are characteristics diagrams useful for explaining the present invention. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Before completion of the present invention, the inventor attempted to realize a magnetic erase head having a gap length of. at least 1 pm in magnetic heads of the type shown in Fig. 1, but found out that such a head could not be easily attained for the following reasons. 1 SiO2 which is suitable as a gap forming member causes diffusion by melting due to thermal pressure contact with the coupling glass and generates bonding power, but the diffusion depth is at most 0.5 pm. If the gap length is about 0.3 pm, therefore, the SiO2 films to be formed on the two blocks become 0.15 pm. When brought into thermal pressure contact, the SiO2 films formed on both blocks diffuse into the coupling glass without leaving the boundary between their contact surfaces. If the gap length is above 1 pm, however, the SiO2 films to be formed on both blocks become 0.5 pm and they can not diffuse and couple with each other by thermal pressure contact so that the boundary remains on their contact surfaces. As a result, both blocks cannot be coupled . 2 When a resin is used as the gap forming member, coupling can be made irrespective of the gap length.However, the resin is unstable to the changes of temperature and moisture, and the changes exceed a practical limit particularly when the gap is at least 1 pm. The present invention is directed to eliminate these problems. Hereinafter, some preferred embodiments of the invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. Fig. 3 is a perspective view showing the magnetic head in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. In the drawing, reference numeral 10 represents a head core, and 12a and 12b represent sub cores consisting of a magnetic ferrite such as Mn Zn or Ni Zn, for example. The surfaces of the sub cores facing each other describe a trapezoidal shape with the tip of the mountain shape being rendered flat . In other words, the sub cores have the protruding sectional shapes projections 12 a and 12 b on their tape facing surfaces. The tip surfaces 12a and 12b of these trapezoidal sub cores 12a and 12b define a laterappearing track width T by their width t. They also serve to prevent magnetic saturation at the edge portions of the sub cores 12a and 12b and to prevent also the damage of the projections 12 a and 12 b during the production process. Since they use a magnetic material, the subcores 12a and 12b increase Q of the magnetic head as well as its erase ratio A. In other words, the erase current head currentIH becomes maximal when an erasing frequency f is in agreement with a resonance frequency fr which is determined by a head inductance L11 and a capacitanceC in accordance with the following equation EMI8.1 When a recording signal of the magnetic tape is erased by this erasing frequency, the erase ratioA, the head current IH and the number of head turns N H have the following relation haIH NH Furthermore, the greater Q, the greater becomes this IHsNH as shown in Fig. 10, and the greater becomes the erase ratio A, too. On the other hand, Q changes with the material of the sub cores 12a and 12b as shown in Fig. 11.When a magnetic material is used for the sub cores, Q becomes greater than when a non magnetic material is used. For, Q has a relation Qa1 R with magnetic resistance R. As shown in Fig. 12, Q is also associated with the gap length Z, and the greater the gap length Q, the greater becomes Q. As described above, suitable electro magnetic characteristics for the erase head can be obtained by a composite structure which uses the magnetic material for the sub cores 12a and 12b and which sets the gap length R to be at least 1 pm. Reference numerals 13a and 13b represent main cores made of a magnetic alloy. The main cores are formed uniformly on the surface of the trapezoidal projections 12 a and 12 b of the sub cores, respectively. The main cores 13a and 13b include head gap facing surfaces 13aa and 13ba that are in parallel with one another and have a predetermined angle with respect to the travelling direction of the magnetic recording medium, and crossing surfaces inclined surfaces 13ab, 13ac, 13bb, 13bc, that cross slantingly the head facing surfaces. The inclined surfaces 13ab, 13ac, 13bb and 13be together form a narrow track. Any high permeability materials can be used for the main cores 13a and 13b so long as they have a higher saturation flux density that the sub cores 12a, 12b and near zero magnetostriction. Definite examples include Fe Si alloys, Fe A Si alloys or so called sendust alloys , Ni Fe alloys or so called permalloys ., magnetic amorphous alloys consisting of Co, Fe and the like as the principal components, and so forth. The main cores 13a and 13b may also comprise a laminated magnetic member produced by alternately laminating 100 to 1 pm thick nonmagnetic layers of SiO2 or A 2O3 and a high saturation flux density layers. The sum of the thickness of the laminate is several microns pm . Reference numerals 14a and 14b represent gap forming members made of a non magnetic material.These members are formed uniformly on the projecting portions of the main cores 13a and 13b, that is, on the head gap facing surfaces 13aa, 13ba and the inclined surfaces 13ab, 13ac, 13bb and 13bc, respectively, as shown in the drawing. Any materials can be used for the gap forming members 14a, 14b so long as they are non magnetic materials, but it is preferred to use SiO2, At203 or the like because such a non magnetic material has good adhesion with the magnetic alloy of the main cores 13a, 13b and has high affinity with later appearing coupling glass 18 18a, 18b . The gap forming members may consist of a laminate of a plurality of kinds of non magnetic materials. The parallel surfaces at the center of the gap forming members 14a, 14b are coupled with each other in such a manner as to define a gap 11 corresponding to the track width T by this joint surface. The width of this gap 11 or the track width T is formed when the main cores 13a, 13b and the gap forming members 14a, 14b are laminated on the surfaces of the trapezoidal projections 12 a, 12 b of the subcores 12a, 12b. Therefore, the width of the gap 11 or the track width T can be defined by the width t of the tip surfaces 12aa, 12ba of the trapezoidal projections 12 a, 12 b of the sub cores 12a, 12b.When, for example, the track width T is 40 pm, the width t of the sub cores 12a, 12b may be set to about 37 pm in consideration of the thickness of the laminate 1 to several microns of the main cores and the gap forming members. Both ends of each gap forming member 14a, 14b expands outwards diagonally vertically in the drawing over the entire width W of the tape contact surface. The gap 11 having the erase function is set so as to satisfy the relation Q X 1 with respect to a gap length Q and an erase signal frequency l. The erase signal frequency has a higher frequency at least 5 MHz than a luminance FM signal frequency, and Q is at least 1 pm and is ordinarily from 2 to 3 pm The angle of the gap 11 azimuth angle can be set arbitrarily. However, since the 8 mm video uses azimuth recording, the gap angle of 900 socalled azimuth zero with respect to the scanning angle of the magnetic head is most effective In other words, if the width t of the tip surfaces of the trapezoidal projections 12 a, 12 b of the subcores 12a, 12b is 900 with respect to the scanning direction, the gap forming members 14a, 14b to be laminated can be formed in the same way. Though the gap forming members 14a, 14b have a predetermined thickness in accordance with the length Q of the gap 11, they are preferably laminated substantially in the thickness of 1 2Q. If the gap length Z is 3 pm, for example, the sub cores 12a and 12b may be laminated in a thickness of 1.5 pm, respectively. The coupling glass 18 18a, 18b is filled into a V shaped groove narrow track contracted portion which is farmed by the inclined surfaces 13ab, 13bb and 13ac, 13be of the main cores 13a and 13b when the center portions of the gap forming members 14a, 14b are bonded. From the aspect of the production process, this glass is preferably low melting point glass with lead and boric acid. This low fusion glass has low wear resistance. However, this drawback car be covered by using a material having high wear resistance for the gap forming members 14a, 14b and extending the material throughout the entire width W of the tape contact surface.In addition, excessive wear of the coupling glass 18 18at 18b can be prevented. Reference numeral 16 represents a winding hole and 17 does a winding for applying the erase signal. Next, the production method of the magnetic head shown in Fig. 3 will be explained with reference to Fig. 4. a Trapezoidal grooves 23a, 23b for contracting the track width are formed on magnetic ferrite substrates 12a, 12b sub cores such as Mn Zn, NiZn or the like as shown in Figs. 4 a and 4 b .The trapezoidal grooves 23a, 23b can be formed by fixing the ferrite substrates of Mn Zn, Ni Zn or the like by lapping and then working the substrates by dicing saw. The grooves may have an arbitrary shape such as U shaped grooves so long as they can define the track width. The winding hole 16 is further formed on the ferrite substrate 12b in a direction that crosses at right angles the trapezoidal groove 23b as shown in Fig. 4 b . b Next, the magnetic alloy main core 13a 13b is vacuum deposited on the surface of the ferrite substrate 12a 12b as shown in Fig. 4 c . Here, a magnetic amorphous material such as Co Nb Zr amorphous is sputtered in a thickness of several microns. c The non magnetic material gap forming member l4a, 14b is then laminated on the upper surface of this magnetic alloy 13a 13b as shown in Fig.4 d . The gap forming member is obtained by, for example, sputtering SiO2 or the like in the same way as the step b and shaping it to about 1.5 pm which is half the length of the gap length Q. d A non magnetic glass material 18a 18b is filled into the trapezoidal groove 14 a, 14 b formed after the step c as shown in Figs. 4 e and 4 f . Low melting point glass with lead and boric acid, for example, which has affinity with the gap forming member 14a, 14b is filled into the groove 14 a, 14 b. e After the step c is completed, the winding hole 16 is formed on at least one of the blocks in a direction crossing at right angles the trapezoidal groove 23a, 23b as shown in Fig. 4 f , and these two blocks are then brought into thermal pressure contact as shown in Fig. 4 f . Here, the blocks 24a and 24b formed on the basis of the two kinds of ferrite substrates Figs. 4 a and 4 b are pressurized in such a manner that the gap forming members 14a and 14b come into mutual contact, and they are simultaneously heated. Pressure bonding can be attained more quickly with a higher heating temperature, but the heating temperature is set to be below about 5000C because the Curie point ofCo Nb Zr is about 5000C.Due to this heating, both blocks 24a and 24b can be bonded by the diffusion and melting of SiO2 of the gap forming members 14a, 14b, the low fusion glass 18a, 18b and the low fusion glass disposed on both blocks 24a, 24b. f Thereafter, this block is cut in a predetermined size. In other words, the block is cut along one dot chain lines 25a, 25b in Fig. 4 h to obtain the magnetic head having the gap length of about 3 pm shown in Fig. 1. The gap length Q can be set arbitrarily by changing the thickness of theSiO2 film of the step c . It is also possible to form the gap by further laminating non magnetic materials other than SiO2, such as At, Cr and the like that can be oxidized. According to the production method described above, the low fusion glass is exposed on the joint surfaces of both blocks 24a, 24b, so that reliable bonding can be attained and at the same time, a magnetic head having an arbitrary gap length can be obtained. The size of this magnetic head is about 2 mm square, and there can be provided a rotary magnetic erase head which can be mounted to a rotary magnetic head device. In the foregoing embodiments, the shapes of the surfaces 12 a, 12 b on the side of the gap ll of the sub cores 12a, 12b are trapezoidal, but they may be 2 shaped or V shaped as shown in Figs. 5 and 6. In Fig. 5, the main cores 13a, 13b and the gap forming members 14a, 14b have linear portions extending from both ends of the gap facing surfaces in the horizontal direction and curved portions inclined surfaces extending diagonally vertically from the ends of the linear portions as shown in the drawing. In the case of the V shape shown inFig. 6, the main cores 13a, 13b are shpaed so that the joint surface sides are trapezoidal and the main cores define the track width T. Incidentally, like reference numerals are used in Figs. 5 and 6 to represent the same or like constituents as in the embodiment shown in Fig. 3 and the detailed description of such constituents is omitted. The magnetic heads shown in Figs. 5 and 6 can be produced in the same way as above. Fig. 7 is a perspective view of a magnetic head in accordance with still another embodiment of the present invention. After the magnetic alloy 13a,.13b and the non magnetic material 14a, 14b as the gap forming members are formed on the surfaces of the trapezoidal projections 12a, 12b of the magnetic ferrite 12a, 12b, the magnetic alloy 13c, 13d are further deposited by sputtering, and the magnetic ferrite 12a, 12b is bonded with each other on the boundary surface 32 by the low fusion glass 18 18a, l8b . Here, the magnetic alloy 13a, 13b is 2 to 3 pm thick, the gap forming member 14a, 14b is 1.5 to 3 pm thick and the magnetic alloy 13c, 13d is I to 2 pm thick. Next, the windings 17a, 17b are wired as shown in the drawing, and when the erase signal is applied to the windings, the non magnetic materials 14a and 14b become separate magnetic gaps, forming a so called double gap type magnetic head 10 . As is known in the art, the erase characteristics of the double gap type magnetic head are superior to those of the single gap type head shown in Fig. 3. In other words, the erasing current can be reduced in comparison with the type shown in Fig. 3, and unnecessary signal leakage in the rotary magnetic head device can be further reduced. If the number of layers of the non magnetic material is increased, a triple or quadruple magnetic gap can be constituted and the erase performance can be improved drastically. Fig. 8 shows still another embodiment of the present invention. Fig. 8 a is a perspective view showing the magnetic gap 11 of the magnetic head,Fig. 8 b is a perspective view showing the state in which two cores are thermally pressure bonded via the gap forming members 14 a, 14 b, and Fig.8 c is a perspective view showing the fusion and melting state of the gap forming member after pressure bonding. Though these drawings show only one magnetic head, a plurality of magnetic heads such as shown in Fig. 4 are simultaneously produced in the actual production process. In Fig. 8 a , the magnetic amorphous material 13a, 13b as the main core is bonded to the trapezoidal projections 12 a, 12 b of the sub cores 12a, 12b consisting of Mn Zn ferrite, the low fusion glass 18 is filled into the portions of the main cores other than the track width T and the magnetic gap forming material, that is, SiO2 film 14 , 14 , and is then bonded. The SiO2 film 14 , 14 is rectangular which extends to the core width of the head core 12, that it, throughout the entire widthW of the tape abrasion surface. The SiO2 films 14 a and 14 b have different thickness m and n from each other. Since the p ractical magnetic gap length is 3 pm, m is 2.5 pm and n is 0.5 pm. This value n 0.5 pm corresponds to the maximum diffusion and melting depth of SiO2 and the low fusion glass due to the thermal pressure bonding at the step shown in Fig. 8 b .At this step, the heating temperature is set within a range that does not exceed theCurie point of the magnetic amorphous material 13a, 13b, and diffusion of SiO2 is effected virtually at about 460 C. The portion with oblique lines in Fig. 8 c represents the SiO2 film 14 a, l4 b and the portion with dots represents the portion where the mixture of SiO2 I4 a, 14 b and low fusion glass exists. This magnetic head has the characterizing feature in that the track width T of the magnetic gap 11 can be determined accurately. In other words, only the magnetic amorphous material 13, 13 exists between the sub cores 12a, 12b and the magnetic gap 11 that define the track width and hence the track wide can be determined accurately. SiO2 has higher wear resistance than the low fusion glass, prevents excessive wear of the coupling glass and provides satisfactory tape contact. The structure shown in Fig. 9 can be used by combining the embodiments shown in Figs. 8 and I with the embodiments shown in Figs. 3 and 7. In Fig. 9, the first magnetic alloy 13a, 13b, the first non magnetic material 14a, 14b of SiO2 and the second magnetic alloy 13c, 13d are sequentially bonded by sputtering to the trapezoidal surface of the sub core 12a, 12b of magnetic ferrite and the low fusion glass is then buried into the portions other than the track width. Next, the second non magnetic material 14 a, 14 b is disposed in the same way as in the embodiment shown in Fig. 8, thereby coupling the right and left sub cores 12a, 12b shown in Fig.9. This embodiment is characterized in that three magnetic gaps are disposed on the tape abrasion surface 76, and this magnetic head can provide excellent erase characteristics.
