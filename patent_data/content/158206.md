# A ball bearing.

## Abstract
A ball bearing has an outer ring 1 and an inner ring 2 with respective rolling tracks 4,5 for a set of balls 3 , the ball bearing being of the so called oblique type in which the rolling tracks, in section, constitute arcs of a curve the normal to which at the mid point of the curve is inclined at a pre determined angle with respect to the axis of the rings. Ad jacent the rolling track 5 on the inner ring 2 is a groove 8 the minimum diameter of which is less than that of the rolling track 5 and adjacent the rolling track 4 of the outer ring 1 is a cylindrical surface 6 the diameter of which is less than the maximum diameter of the rolling track 4 . The difference in diameters between the cylindrical surface 6 and the minimum diameter of the groove 8 is such that half this difference is equal to the diameter of a ball.
