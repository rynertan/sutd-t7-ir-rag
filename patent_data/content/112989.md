# Copper texturing process.

## Abstract
A room temperature dry process for texturing the ex posed copper surface of copper polyester laminate, to improve adhesion of coatings to the copper surface through mechanical as well as chemical bonding, involves placing the laminate sample in a chamber, in which an iodine plasma is then produced by evacuating the chamber and backfilling with iodine and applying an RF potential. The iodine plasma includes both positive and negative iodine ions. Unprotected surface areas of the copper form a copper iodine when the copper iodide is removed, the remaining surface is highly textured. The associated polyester is not damaged. The copper iodide is conveniently removed by a 10 hydrochlor ic acid solution which has no damaging effects on the associated polyester or on the metallic copper.
