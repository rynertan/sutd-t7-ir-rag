## Description
The present invention relates to a process for preparing silicon containing preceramic polymers useful for making silicon carbide and silicon nitride silicon carbide ceramics and for their pyrolysis to such ceramic materials. There is a great deal of interest in preceramic polymer materials, which can be pyrolyzed to yield silicon carbide, silicon nitride and other silicon based ceramic materials. R.W. Rice, For instance, Penn et al., Other polymer precursors for forming silicon carbide and silicon nitride ceramics have been described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3 108 985 3 853 567 3 892 583 4 310 651 and 4 312 970. These linear or crosslinked polymers and processes for producing ceramic materials have generally been found to be deficient in one or more ways. US A 4 482 669 describes a preceramic polymer made by reacting an organodihalosilane with ammonia to form an ammonolysis product and treating such product with a basic catalyst capable of deprotonating an NH group that is adjacent to a SiH group. US A 4 535 007 describes a process for preparing a silicon nitride containing ceramic material from an R₃SiNH containing silazane polymer which is said to be rendered infusible by treatment with certain reactive metal halides by heating the silazane polymer to an elevated temperature under an inert atmosphere. US A 4 482 689 describes a process for preparing a R₃ SiNH containing metallosilazane polymers. S. Yajima, The Mark I polymer also contains some CH₃ ₂SiCH₂ units. The Mark III polymer contains some Si Si bonds in the form CH₃ ₂Si Si CH₃ ₂ It would be useful to have a polymer precursor that is formed from readily available and relatively cheap starting materials, that is stable at room temperature, is soluble in organic solvents and whose pyrolysis can typically provide a high yield of ceramic products. It would also be useful to be able to form a ceramic material upon pyrolysis which contains substantially no free silicon, carbon or SiO₂. We have now found that reaction of an organic metal amide or a silylamide with an organosilicon polymer containing Si H units yields new polymeric organosilicon compounds which are useful preceramic materials. Upon pyrolysis these typically give ceramic yields significantly better than the original polysiloxane compound. The method according to the invention comprises a mixing an organosilicon polymer containing Si H repeat units with at least a catalytic amount of an organic metal amide or a silylamide in an organic solvent b allowing the mixture of step a to react at room temperature or above and c quenching the reaction mixture with a reactive electrophile, thereby forming said preceramic organosilicon polymer. Preferably, the silylamide is an alkali or alkaline earth metal silylamide, and more especially a polymeric metal silylamide of the formula R¹SiHNH Alternatively, one may prepare the metal silylamide Preferably the organosilicon polymer is a polysilane compound of the formula RSiH where q is an integer 1 or greater, R Aryl substituted polymers of the type R In one embodiment of the present invention, the polymeric metal silylamide is generated by treating the ammonolysis product of R¹SiHX₂ R¹ is as defined above and X is a halogen with a basic catalyst capable of deprotonating the hydrogen from a nitrogen atom adjacent to a silicon atom. The silylamide thus formed can react with the organosilicon compound, for example, the R Figure 1 is a proton NMR spectrum comparing a polymer formed by adding already preformed polysilylamide III 37 with a 1 1 by weight physical mixture of polycarbosilane and preformed polysilylamide. Figure 2 is a proton NMR spectrum comparing a polymer formed by adding already preformed polysilylamide III 7 with a polymer formed with polysilylamide generated Figure 3 is a thermogravimetric analysis TGA curve of polymer III 7. Figure 4 is a TGA curve of polymer III 42. We have discovered that the reaction of an organic metal amide or a silylamide with an organosilicon polymer containing Si H units referred to as an Si H containing organosilicon polymer results in novel preceramic polymers. Most preferably, the metal amide is a polymeric metal silylamide of the formula R¹SiHNH The Si H containing organosilicon polymer is preferably a polysilane compound of the formula RSiH where q is an integer 1 or greater, R In accord with the present invention, treatment of, for example, organopolysilanes with a metal amide will provide higher molecular weight preceramic materials and improve the ceramic yield. Preferably, one uses organic alkali metal amides for treating the organopolysilane. Organic alkali metal amides are well known to the person of ordinary skill in the art. Examples include potassium piperidide, potassium ethylamide, C₂H₅NHK, and potassium diisopropylamide, i C₃H₇ ₂NK, corresponding lithium, sodium, rubidium and cesium derivatives and the like. Polymeric secondary amines may be partially deprotonated by a strong base to give polymers containing metal amide functions. Such products also may be used to react with CH₃SiH The reaction of CH₃SiHCl₂ with an alkali metal will produce methylsilicon compounds of the formula CH₃SiH After extensive research we have now found that organopolysilanes such as the methylpolysilanes obtained in the above reactions, upon treatment with catalytic quantities of organic metal amides or silylamides in accord with the present invention, yield preceramic polymers of higher molecular weight which upon pyrolysis give significantly higher ceramic yields. Such polymers, when prepared as described herein, are soluble in organic solvents. The resulting products obtained when the organic alkali metal amides were used with the methylpolysilanes were white solids with a higher molecular weight than the starting material. The ceramic yields obtained on pyrolysis to 1000 C typically are 50 to 60 , or more. Another example of useful silylamides is a diorganocyclopolysilazane that is either partially or completely ring opened. The diorganocyclopolysilazane comprises units having the formula R¹R¹¹SiNH More preferably, however, one utilises an alkali or alkaline earth metal silylamide. Common metal silylamides that can be used in the practice of the present invention include R²R³R⁴Si ₂NM wherein R², R³ and R⁴ are each a lower alkyl group having from 1 to about 6 carbon atoms, a lower alkoxy group having from 1 to about 6 carbon atoms, a substituted or unsubstituted vinyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted allyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted lower aryl group having from 6 to about 10 carbon atoms, a tri lower alkyl or di lower alkylsilyl group or a di lower alkylamino group, R², R³ and R⁴ may be the same or different and M is an alkali metal or one half equivalent of an alkaline earth metal. Common alkali metal silylamides include CH₃ ₃Si ₂NK, CH₂ CH Si ₂NK. The metal silylamide can also be partially deprotonated cyclo R⁵R⁶SiNH Polycarbosilane polymers that are used in the present invention preferably contain a multiplicity of repeat units of the formula R The polycarbosilane polymer should contain at least 25 mole of repeat units of the formula II, i.e. R The polymer may also contain a mixture of repeat units of the above described formula, e.g., both R The polycarbosilane and alkali metal silylamide are typically added in a weight ratio of polycarbosilane alkali metal silylamide of about 10 1 or less. Preferably this ratio is about 5 1 or less. More preferably the ratio is about 3 1 or less. Most preferably the ratio is about 1 1. Preferably the polymeric silylamide used has the formula R¹SiHNH The use of the polymeric metal silylamide of the formula R¹SiHNH The weight ratio of Si H containing polymer to metal silylamide can vary widely. For example, mole ratios of organopolysilane polymeric metal silylamide from about 4 1 to about 1 4, and preferably from 2.5 1 to 1 2 typically provide useful results. Weight ratios of polycarbosilane polymeric metal silylamide from about 10 to about 1 and preferably from 5 1 to 1 1 typically provide useful results. However, in both cases other ratios can be used depending on the particular starting materials and their pyrolysis characteristics. The organosilicon polymers thus formed by reaction of the organosilicon polymer containing Si H repeat units with preformed R¹SiHNH Polysilanes of type RSiH Additionally, use of the reaction product of organopolysilanes or polycarbosilanes with the polymeric metal silylamide results in a product that is self curing as the temperature is raised in the production of ceramic material. Consequently, with these polymers it is possible to avoid the formation of SiO₂ which results when an oxidative cure step is used. This again is an improvement over pyrolysis of the precursor silane compound alone. In this system, R or R As mentioned, also included in this invention is the case of RSiH Mixtures of metal polysilazanes, i.e., R¹SiHNH The preceramic product obtained by using alkali metal silylamides, even in only catalytic amounts, differs from the starting organosilicon compound. This difference is confirmed by proton NMR spectra. A typical organopolysilane starting material when R CH₃ shows an observed proton NMR integration ratio, SiCH₃ SiH, ranging from 3.27 through 3.74 see Table 1 . In contrast, the similar ratio for products obtained when the starting material is reacted with an alkali metal silylamide, range from 8.8 to 14. This difference in products apparently arises because both Si H and Si Si bonds are reactive towards nucleophilic reagents. Although not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that when metal silylamides are used the following processes result Thus, not only anionic species but also silylenes can be involved as intermediates. The graft polymer is formed by combining the already formed polymeric metal silylamide with the Si H containing organosilicon polymer, for example, the organopolysilane in varying proportions in an organic solvent. Thereafter, the mixture is stirred at room temperature for sufficient time for the two compounds to react. Any organic solvent in which both polymer systems are soluble without reaction can be used. Such organic solvents include, for example, THF, diethyl ether, glycol ethers, alkanes, arenes and combinations thereof. The mixture may be heated above room temperature, and can be refluxed to speed up the completion of the reaction. After refluxing, the mixture is quenched with an electrophile, E X, to form the organosilicon graft polymer. The electrophile can be an alkyl halide, sulfate, or sulfonate a halosilane or the like. Typically, CH₃I or a chlorosilane is used, although other equivalent electrophiles well known to those skilled in the art can also be used. E is preferably a lower alkyl group or silyl group X preferably a halide, sulfate or sulfonate. The organosilicon polymer formed by the present graft process with the organopolysilane is typically obtained in yields greater than 85 based on weight of the starting materials with a variable molecular weight, typical values being in the 1800 2500 g mol range. This preceramic organosilicon polymer can then by pyrolyzed under inert atmosphere conditions to result in a ceramic material in high yield. Typically, pyrolysis under nitrogen gives ceramic products in a yield of 70 83 . The organosilicon polymers formed by the present graft process typically give ceramic yields 10 to 50 greater based on weight of the starting materials than the polycarbosilane See Table 2 and have a variable molecular weight. Figure 1 is a proton NMR spectrum comparing a 1 1 by weight physical mixture of the polycarbosilane and the polysilazane and a graft polymer formed by reacting the polycarbosilane with a preformed silyamide. The NMR spectrum shows that a new polymer is obtained when the polycarbosilane and the silylamide are heated together in solution and then quenched with methyl iodide. First, the CH₃Si HSi integrated ratio differ, 9.4 in the former, 8.7 in the latter. Secondly, the CH₃Si These preceramic organosilicon polymers can then by pyrolyzed under nitrogen or an inert atmosphere to result in ceramic materials in high yield. Typically, pyrolysis under nitrogen gives ceramic products in a yield of 64 88 . What is referred to herein as an One then adds to the solution a basic catalyst capable of deprotonating the hydrogen from a nitrogen atom adjacent to a silicon atom. See U.S. Patent No. 4,482,669. The reaction mixture gradually changes color and hydrogen is evolved. The resulting solution is then stirred at room temperature for sufficient time for the silylamide intermediates and the Si H containing organosilicon polymer to react. It can be heated above room temperature, and can be heated at reflux to speed the completion of the reaction. Afterwards, the reaction mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature, if required, and quenched with an electrophile such as CH₃I or a halosilane, such as a chlorosilane, to produce the organosilicon On pyrolysis the polycarbosilane derived material provides a yield of a black ceramic material, that is typically 10 to 50 greater than that obtained on pyrolysis of the polycarbosilane see Table 2 . The organosilicon polymer formed by either of the above graft or The Figure 2 shows the proton NMR spectrum of a graft polymer and that of an Although not wishing to be bound by theory, it appears likely that in the The TGA curve of the graft polymer is shown in Figure 3, while that of the The use of the metal silylamide of the formula R¹SiHNH The excess of free carbon, which can be a problem with the starting polycarbosilanes, can be dealt with by using a ternary system of 1 the polycarbosilane 2 the polysilazane as the polymeric silylamide, either preformed or generated Physical blends of Si H containing organosilicon polymers, for example the organopolysilane, or the polycarbosilane polymers containing repeat units of R When polycarbosilane orgosilazane mixtures were heated, in the absence of a solvent at 200 Ternary blends of the polycarbosilane, the CH₃SiH The combined polymers obtained by the graft, Similarly, when silicon carbide powder was dispersed in toluene solutions of the combined polycarbosilane organosilazane polymers. The solvent was evaporated and the residue, a fine powder of silicon carbide with combined polymer binder, was pressed into bars and pyrolyzed at 1000 The invention will be further illustrated by the examples that follow All glassware was flame dried under vacuum or under a stream of nitrogen prior to use. Tetrahydrofuran THF and benzene were distilled from sodium and benzophenone ketyl. Hexane was distilled from LiAlH₄. Solvents were deoxygenated by bubbling nitrogen through them prior to use. Methyldichlorosilane, CH₃SiHCl₂, and dimethyldichlorosilane, CH₃ ₂SiCl₂, were commercial products. The polycarbosilane was purchased from Dow Corning Corporation. Its characterization is reported below. The ammonolysis of CH₃SiHCl₂ in ether and in THF solution has been described in U.S. Patent No. 4,482,699 D. Seyferth and G.H. Wiseman , as has the reaction of ammonolysis products, CH₃SiHNH Poly methydrosiloxane , CH₃Si H O ¹H NMR spectra were recorded on a JEOL FX 90Q spectrometer operating at 90 MHz. Elemental analyses were performed by Galbraith Laboratories, Knoxville, Tennessee. Molecular weights were determined by measuring the freezing point depression of a weighed sample of benzene caused by a weighed sample of product. Thermal analyses were performed using a Perkin Elmer TGS 2 Thermogravimetric Analyzer interfaced with a System 7 4 Thermal Analysis Controller on a DuPont 950 TGA connected to a DuPont thermal analysis system. Samples were heated, under argon, from 25 1000 A 500 ml, three necked, round bottomed flask equipped with a stir bar, a dropping funnel and a reflux condenser was charged with 50.5 g 2.20 g atom of Na metal. The flask was attached to a Schlenk manifold, evacuated and refilled with nitrogen three times. THF 200 ml was added and the dropping funnel was charged with 65 ml 0.625 mol of CH₃SiHCl₂. The silane was added to the stirred Ha suspension during the course of 45 min., after which time the reaction mixture was cloudy and slightly warm. The mixture was stirred for 16 hours at room temperature and 48 hours at reflux it then was cooled to room temperature. Hexane 60 ml was added. The mixture was transferred by cannula to a heavy walled centrifuge bottle and centrifuged. The supernatant layer was transferred to a 1 liter round bottomed flask under nitrogen . THF 50 ml and hexane 30 ml were added to the residual solid and the resulting suspension was centrifuged. The supernatant layers were combined and solvents were removed by trap to trap distillation in vacuum until the residual liquid volume was about 100 ml. This liquid was cannulated into a 250 ml single necked flask and the remaining solvent was removed in vacuo to leave 13.2 g 0.30 mol, 48 yield of a white, glassy solid. On being heated in a sealed capillary in vacuo this solid softened around 40 C and melted between 130 140 C with gas evolution, leaving a thick gum. There was no further change up to 300 C except for a gradual increase in viscosity. The product was poorly soluble in hexane, only somewhat soluble in benzene precluding measurement of its cryoscopic molecular weight in this solvent and quite soluble in THF.

A mass spectral analysis of the pyrolysis gas in another experiment showed the following no gaseous products were observed up to 385 C, then fragment ions corresponding well with the reported fragmentation of CH₃SiH₃. At 445 C, CH₃SiH₃ was still observed and a peak at m z 16 CH₄ began to grow in. By 580 C, when weight loss was about over, only the methane peak was observable. In a dry box, a 1 liter three necked, round bottomed flask equipped with a stir bar, a dropping funnel and a reflux condenser was charged with 75.0 g 3.26 mol of sodium metal. The flask was attached to a Schlenk manifold, evacuated and flushed with nitrogen. THF 70 ml and hexane 420 ml were added and the dropping funnel was charged with 150 ml 1.44 mol of methyldichlorosilane. Methyldichlorosilane was added slowly into the flask over a 3 hour period. The reaction solution turned purple and by the end of the addition was at gentle reflux. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 hours and then heated at reflux for 16 hours. After it had been cooled to room temperature, the reaction mixture except for the large NaCl crystals was transferred via cannula into a heavy walled glass bottle. The mixture was centrifuged and the clear, colorless supernatant layer transferred by cannula into a 1 liter round bottomed flask equipped with a stir bar. Hexane 200 ml and THF 20 ml were added to the remaining solids, the mixture again was centrifuged, and the supernatant liquid combined with the supernatant solution previously separated. Solvent was removed by trap to trap distillation until the volume of the residue was about 100 ml, and the remaining liquid was transferred by cannula into a weighed 250 ml round bottomed flask. Remaining solvent was removed by trap to trap distillation at approximately 0.05 mm Hg 10 Pa at room temperature to give 51.2 g 81 , 1.16 mol of a cloudy white oil. NMR integration of the product gave a constitution of CH₃SiH The pure liquid obtained by this procedure is very air sensitive, particularly when its effective surface area is high, as when in contact with a fritted funnel or a paper or cloth towel in which cases spontaneous inflammation may occur . Other, similar reactions have given 62 75 yields of CH₃SiH For the purpose of simplifying calculation, an average formula weight value 44 was assigned for the unit CH₃SiH The product formed in the THF solution gives a 60 ceramic yield, but it is of limited solubility in organic solvents and its conversion to ceramic fibers requires a curing step of photolysis oxidation.
