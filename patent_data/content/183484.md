# CHARACTER COMPRESSION ENCODING

## Abstract
The present invention is concerned with compression encoding and, in particular, the encoding of the second difference of the position of the boundary of a character on consecutive scanlines. Special code sequences represent the starting location for two new character boundaries relative to the last position in the scanline generated, the next two character boundaries that do not extend into the next scanline, and the end of a line when the preceding scanline had no intersections with a character boundary. Also in cluded are code sequences representing the first item on the last scanline of the character to terminate the code and at the right of all other boundaries on the current scanline.
