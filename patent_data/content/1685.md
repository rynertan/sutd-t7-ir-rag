## Abstract
An electrical connector in combination with a multi wire electrical cable and a method of producing such a combination. The connector comprises first 115 and second 136 insulating housings each provided with slotted plate contacts 105 and 160 . First wires 102 of a cable 100 are connected to the contacts 105 of the first housing 115 , the housings 115 and 136 are mated and second wires 101 of the cable 100 are connected to the contact 160 of the second housing 136 . For selectively grounding signal wires 102 of a flat multi wire cable 100 , the contacts 160 of the second housing 136 are formed with a common bus bar 142 from which depend removable contact arms 143 for engaging the contacts 105 of the first housing 115 . All the contacts 105 and 160 are spaced so that the cable wires 101 and 102 need not be spread.
