# A MASKLESS PROCESS FOR APPLYING A PATTERNED COATING

## Abstract
A process for applying a patterned coating to a circuit board 31 without the use of a patterning mask. A surface 30 of the circuit board is coated with uncured material 32 having a cure reaction which is inhibited by the presence of oxygen. The thickness of the material on land areas 34 surrounding holes 36 through the circuit board is reduced by causing a portion of the material to flow into the holes. The material is then exposed, in the presence of oxygen, to an energy source which advances the cure reaction only of sublayers 37 of the material which are isolated from the oxygen by overlayers 38 of the material. Surface layers of the material, including substantially the entire thickness of the reduced thickness portions of the layer, remain uncured, allowing subsequent selective removal of the uncured portions of the material.
