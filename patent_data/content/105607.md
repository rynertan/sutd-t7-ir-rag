# MODIFIED POLYURETHANE PRODUCT HAVING IMPROVED LOAD BEARING CHARACTERISTICS

## Abstract
A modified low density flexible polyurethane foam product having a relatively high degree of firmness as well as commercially acceptable dielectric heat sealing characteris tics. The product formulation includes an intermediate constituted by a mixture of polyol and a polymer polyol in a ratio imparting to the product a predetermined degree of firmness, and a thermoplastic additive whose dielectric loss index is greater than the loss index of polyurethane foam to impart to the product an acceptable dielectric heating response in a high frequency electric field. This response is enhanced by a styrene component included in the polymer polyol.
