## Description
Transconductance amplifier. The invention relates to a transconductance amplifier comprising at least two transistors which are arranged as a differential amplifier and which are powered by a current source, in which an input voltage is applied between the bases of said transistors and the currents in the collectors of said transistors constitute the output currents of the amplifier. Such transconductance amplifiers or, briefly, transconductors, may be used in, for example, integrated filter circuits comprising transconductors and capacitors.A transconductor can perform the function of a resistor and two transconductors may be arranged as a gyrator which in combination with a capacitor can perform the function of an inductance. Therefore, any filter circuit comprising conventional coils, capacitors and resistors can also be realised by means of transconductors and capacitors. In particular, such transconductors may be used in integrated filter circuits intended for use in a high frequency equalising circuit of a compact disc player. A transconductor is a voltage controlled current source in which the proportionality factor between the output current and the input voltage is given by the transconductance G. The simplest transconductor is a differential amplifier by means of which a voltage applied between the bases is converted into two collector currents of opposite phase. The transconductance of such a differential amplifier is proportional to the current of the current source which powers the differential amplifier. In many cases the current of this current source cannot be made arbitrarily small for reasons of circuit design. As a result of this, the transconductance of the amplifier is comparatively high and, consequently, the resistance to be realised R 1 G is relatively low.This relatively high trans conductance means that comparatively high capacitances are required in order to obtain the time constants necessary for a specific filter characteristic.Integrating these capacitances demands comparatively large surface areas, which renders the integrated circuit expensive Therefore, it is desirable to have comparatively low transconductances in order to minimize the capacitances required for a specific filter response and hence the integration area needed for these capacitances. The article Bipolar Integration of Analog Gyrator and Laguerre typeFilters Transconductor capacitor filters in ProceedingsECCTD 1983, pp. 109 110 describes a transconductor of the type specified in the opening paragraph, which has a relatively low transconductance. In this circuit a fracionn of the total input voltage is applied to the actual inputs of the trans conductor by means of a resistive voltage divider.This results in a reduction of the effective transconductance, so that lower capacitances and consequently smaller integration areas are needed for a given filter response. A disadvantage of this known transconductor is that the voltage divider resistors can be integrated only with limited accuracy, which restricts the accuracy and frequency range of the voltage divider. Moreover, a comparatively large integration area is needed for the resistors, in particular for the resistors of high value. It is the object of the invention to provide a simple transconductance amplifier which has a relatively low transconductance. According to the invention a transconductance amplifier of the type defined in the opening paragraph is characterized in that the collector currents are each divided into a first current and a second currfflt by means of a current dividing circuit and the second currents are added crosswise to the first currents. The invention is based on the recognition of the following fact. Apart from an identical direct current, the two collector currents each contain a signal current of equal magnitude but opposite phase. By taking a fraction of each collector current and adding this to the other collector current, two signal currents of opposite phase are added to each other, so that the resulting signal current is smaller than the original collector signal current. The resulting direct current remains equal to the original collector direct current. As the signal current is reduced and the input voltage remains the same, the effective transconductance of the circuit is thus reduced. An embodiment of the invention may be characterized in that the current dividing circuits each comprise two transistors with parallel connected base emitter junctions and a common emitter terminal which is connected to the collector of a transistor of the differential amplifier, the collector of one transistor of the current dividing circuit carrying the first current and the collector of the other transistor of the current dividing circuit carrying the second current. The ratio between the first current and the second current can be adjusted simply by means of the ratio between the emitter areas of the two transistors of such a current dividing circuit. The invention will now be described in more detail, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawing, in which Figure 1 is the basic diagram of a transconductance amplifier in accordance with the invention, and Figure 2 shows a trans conductance amplifier in accordance with a particular embodiment of the invention Fig. 1 is the basic diagram of a transconductance amplifier in accordance with the invention The amplifier comprises two transistors T1 and T2 arranged as a differential pair and having their common emitter terminal 3 connected to a current source 4 supplying a current 21. In the quiescent state this current is equally divided between the transistors T1 and T2.When a signal voltage is applied between the bases of the transistors T1 and T2 a signal current i will flow in the collector of the transistor T1 and a signal current i in the collector of the transistor T2. The total collector current of transistor T1 is therefore equal to 11 I i and the total collector current of the transistor T2 is I2 I i. The collector of the transistor T1 isconnected to the input of a current dividing circuit 5, shown schematically, which divides the collector current I1 of transistor T1 into two currents I3 and 14 which are in a ratio of 1 a. Similarly, the collector of the transistor T2 is connected to a current dividing circuit 6, which divides the collector current I2 of the transistor T2 into two currents I and I6, which are also in 5 16, a ratio of 1 a. The current 16 is added to the current I3 and the sum of these currents constitutes one output current I7. In the same way the current 14 is added to the current I5 and the sum of these currents constitutes the other output current 18. The current 17 is equal to 17 13 I6 I i 1 I i a 1 1 a 1 a I i. 1 a 1 a The current 18 is equal to 18 14 I5 I i a a I i 1 a 1 i.1 a 2 Equations 1 and 2 show that the signal currents are 1 a a factor 1 a smaller than the original signal currents and that the direct currents remain the same. Owing to the smaller signal current the transconductance of the circuit, which is given by the ratio between the output signal current and the input signal voltage, also becomes a factor 1 a smaller than the original transconductance.1 a When the circuit is employed in integrated filter circuits comprising transconductors and capacitors, the desired time constant of the filter circuit can be obtained using smaller capacitanceq which can be integrated on a smaller area, owing to the smaller transconductances. Figure 2 shows a circuit in accordance with a particular embodiment of the invelltion. The transconductance amplifier comprises a first differential pair of transistors T10 and T11, whose common emitter terminal is connected to a current source 10 supplying a current I, which pair is arranged in parallel with a second differential pair comprising transistors T12 and T13,. whose common emitter terminal is connected to a current source 11 supplying a current I. The collectors of the transistorsT10 and T12 and the collectors of the transistorsh T11 andT13 are interconnected. The transistors T10 and T12, like the transistors T11 and T13, have different emitter areas.The ratio between the emitter areas of the transistors T10 and T11, for example 4, is equal to the ratio between the emitter areas of the transistors T13 and T12. In 13 comparison with that of Figure 1, such a transconductance amplifier provides a larger range in which the output current increases as a linear function of the input voltage.The common collector current 11 of the transistors T10 andT12 is applied to a current dividing circuit 13 comprising a diode connected transistor T14 and a transistor T15 whose base emitter junction is arranged in parallel with that of transistor T14. The ratio between the collector current I, of the transistor T14 and the collector current 14 of the transistor T15 is determined by the ratio between the emitter areas of these transistors. For example, if the emitter area of transistor T14 is twice as large as the emitter area of transistor T15, the currentI3 will be twice as large as the current I4.The common collector current I2 of the transistors T1l and T13 is divided into a current I and a current I6 by means of a 5 current dividing circuit 14 which comprises the transistors T16 and T17 and which is similar to the current dividing circuit 13. The collector current 16 of the transistor T17 together with the collector current I3 of transistor T14 3 constitutes the output current I7 and the collector current 14 of transistor T15 together with the collector current 15 of transistor T16 constitutes the output current I 8 For a ratio of two between the emitter areas of the transistors T14 and T15 the factor a 2 see equations 1 and 2 .The transconductance is then 1 3 of the trans conductance of theoriginal circuit. The invention is not limited to the present current dividing circuit Within the scope of the invention any current dividing circuit may be used. For example, the emitter areas of the transistors of a current dividing circuit may be equal and the ratio between the output currents of the current dividing circuit may be adjusted by means of resistors arranged in the emitter lines of the transistors. Furthermore, the invention is not limited to the transconductance amplifiers described above but any other trans conductance amplifier with a differential pair may be employed, for example that described in the aforementioned article in Proceedings of ECCTD 83 and that in the IEEE Journal of Solid State Circuits SC 17 713 722 Integration of analog filters in a bipolar process. Finally, it is to be noted that the use of transconductance amplifiers in accordance with the invention is not limited to integrated filter circuits, but that they may also be used in any other arrangement in which a low trans conductance is required.
