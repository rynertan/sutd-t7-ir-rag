# Improvements in or relating to bearing races.

## Abstract
In an annular metal bearing race, at least one groove e.g. 12, 14 extends longitudinally across the race 10 . The race 10 includes a relatively soft metal core 16 with its radially inner and outer surface regions 18,20 being carburized. The sides 26, 28 of the groove 12, 14 are also carburized and a carburized portion 30 extends radially from the bottom of the groove entirely across the race.
