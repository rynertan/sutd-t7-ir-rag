# Magnetic recording method and apparatus magnetic record medium produced by such method and method of using such record medium.

## Abstract
A reference signal to be stabilized in a magnetic record member is recorded via a head H1 having a given maximal gap length and pole pieces of high saturation induction. After the reference signal is recorded, the magnetic record member is surface erased for stabilizing the just recorded reference signal. The surface erasing is performed by AC erasing via a transducer H2 having a gap length less than said maximal gap length. The pole pieces of the erasing head need not have the high saturation induction of the first mentioned head. After such stabilization, information signals can be easily recorded and recovered from the magnetic record member by using transducers H3 with gap lengths less than the given maximal gap length of head H1 and using normal ferrite heads having a lower saturation induction than the head H1. The reference signal can serve as a position indicating signal in a magnetic record member, such as a storage disk or tape. The reference signal can also be used for other purposes, such as phase control for recording and in a controlled access or security system.
