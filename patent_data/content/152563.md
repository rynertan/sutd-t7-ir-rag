# Method and apparatus for radiation image recording and read out.

## Abstract
In a radiation image recording and read out system, a radiation image is recorded on a stimulable phosphor sheet by use of an irradiation field stop for defining an irradiation field. The stimulable phosphor sheet is then exposed to stimulating rays which cause it to emit light in proportion to the radiation energy stored. The emitted light is photoelec trically detected. The radiation image read out region of the stimulable phosphor sheet is limited within the irradiation field. When preliminary read out is conducted prior to final read out by use of stimulating rays having stimulation en ergy lower than the stimulation energy of stimulating rays used in the final read out, the radiation image read out region in the preliminary read out is limited within the ir radiation field.
