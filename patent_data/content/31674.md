# LIQUEFACTION OF CARBONACEOUS MATERIAL WITH HYDROGEN AND NAPHTHA EXTRACTED RECYCLE SOLVENT WITHOUT HETEROGENOUS CATALYST

## Abstract
A process for the liquefaction of solid carbonaceous ma terial, e.g., coal in the presence of hydrogen under pressure in the absence of heterogeneous hydrogenation catalyst using a hydrogen transfer solvent which is the fraction extracted from coal derived liquids by a process derived naphtha extractant containing less than 20 weight percent of aromatics. Coal de rived liquids are extracted with naphtha and recycled as a slur ry medium for the carbonaceous material.
