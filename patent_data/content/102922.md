Each insert exhibits a notch 4, 4 in which the bent end of a square spring 5, 5 fits, the spring is solid at the other end with a block 6, 6 that can slide in a guide 1 , 2 of the shape and is provided with a tension screw 7, 7 . By the screw being tightened, the sections of shape 1, 2 are thrust outward, leaving a space 10 between them, and causing the stretching of the canvas.
