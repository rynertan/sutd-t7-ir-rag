# Processes for preparing D,L 2 amino 4 hydroxy methyl phosphinoyl butyric acid and an acetal of an ester of 3 oxopropylmethyl phosphinic acid.

## Abstract
A process for the production of D,L 2 amino 4 methylsulphosphino butyric acid having both herbicidic and fungicidic activities, in which dialkylmethylphosphonite is reacted with acrolein to synthesize an acetal of 3 oxopropylmethylphosphinic acid ester, the compound is subjected to deacetalization to obtain 3 oxo propylmethylphosphinic acid ester and then Strecker reac tion for the synthesis of an amino acid is effected.
