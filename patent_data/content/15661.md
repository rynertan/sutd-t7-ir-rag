# Apparatus for automatically folding the end closures of cartons.

## Abstract
The disclosures relates to apparatus for automatically outfolding the leading and trailing gusset panels 21, 23 of the end closure of a rectangular carton being moved along a predetermined path on a continuous conveyor 31 . First and second arms 43, 45 are attached to a vertical shaft 51 and to a cylindrical holder 77 mounted for independent rotation about the shaft 51 . The shaft 51 and holder 67 rotate in opposite directions so that one arm 43 contacts the leading gusset panel 21 and folds it outward along a line at an angle to its hinged edges and the other arm 45 subsequently contacts the trailing gusset panel 23 and a similarly folds it outward. A plow 87 positioned adjacent the conveyor path begins to plow the major end closure panel 19 toward the carton open ing while the rotating arm 43 is in contact with the lead ing gusset panel 21 .
