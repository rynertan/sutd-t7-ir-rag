# A parts loader in a die casting machine and method of operation thereof.

## Abstract
The disclosure relates to a parts loading unit in a die casting machine such as, for example, for loading various diameter and stack height sizes of rotor assemblies into the compensator sleeves of multiple cavity rotor dies for the sub sequent casting of the conductor bars and end rings of squir rel cage electrical motor rotors. The loading unit comprises a magazine section 350 having a plurality of inclined guide tracks 40, 42, 44, 56 on which the rotor preforms 60 are stacked, and an escapement mechanism 48 which permits one rotor 60 preform at a time to roll from each of the guide tracks in the magazine section onto respective inclined guide tracks 196, 198, 200, 202 leading to the breech openings of the die cavities. The guide tracks are laterally adjustable so as to accommodate rotor preforms of various stack height. As the rotor preforms roll down the inclined guide track toward the die cavities, they are decelerated by means of pivotally mounted, counterweighted arms 274 which are contacted by and then swung out of the way by the rotors. The rotors 60 are magnetically held by holding magnets 294 in the proper position within the compensator sleeves 210, 222, 224, 226 , and photoelectric sensors 298 provide an indication of whether or not proper positioning has been achieved. The compensator sleeves are closed and molten aluminium is cast around a portion of the rotor preforms to form the end rings and conductor bars.
