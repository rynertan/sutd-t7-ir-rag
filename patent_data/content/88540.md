# DNA SEQUENCES, RECOMBINANT DNA MOLECULES AND PROCESSES FOR PRODUCING HUMAN IMMUNE INTERFERON LIKE POLYPEPTIDES

## Abstract
DNA sequences, recombinant DNA molecules and hosts transformed with them which produce polypeptides displaying a biological or immunological activity of human immune interferon, the genes coding for these polypeptides and methods of making and using these DNA sequences, molecules, hosts, genes and polypeptides. The DNA se quences are characterized in that they code for a polypep tide displaying a biological or immunological activity of human immune interferon. They also produce such poly peptides having appropriate glycosylation. In appropriate hosts these DNA sequences and recombinant DNA molecules permit the production and identification of genes and polypeptides displaying a biological or immunological activity of human immune interferon and their use in antivi ral, antitumor or anticancer, and immunomodulation agents and methods.
