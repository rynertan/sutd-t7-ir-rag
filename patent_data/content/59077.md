# Method of orientating thermoplastic polyether ether ketone films.

## Abstract
A thermoplastic polyether ether ketone film or sheet con taining therein a repeating unit represented by the formula The polymeric film or sheet may contain units to give heat resistance, e.g. of a polyether sulfone. 16 examples of repeat ing units of a polyarylene polyether sulfone are given. A lubricant, e.g. polyethylene glycol, may be used, and the film may be preheated. The rolled film or sheet may have a thickness of 28 to 270 µm and has a high tensile strength of up to 3040 Pa 10⁵ in the longitudinal direction.
