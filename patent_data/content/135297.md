## Description
SYNTHESIS OF INDANEDIONEPROPIONIC ACIDS AND PRODUCTS THEREFROM, MICROORGANISMS FOR USE THEREIN AND THEIR PRODUCTION This invention relates to the microbial production of 7a methyl 1 ,5 dioxo 3aa hexahydroindane 4a propionic acid hereinafter referred to as indanedionepropionic acid for simplicity represented by Formula I below and starting from a 3 hydroxy or oxo steroid.EMI1.1 Indanedionepropionic acid I is a known intermediate for preparing 19 norteroids, antiandrogens, and the like.Microbial production of this compound is also known from e.g., Japanese patent application Kokai 53 69885 andBiochimica et Biophysica Acta, Vol. 531, page 308 1978 , using Mycobacterium fortuitum NRRL B 8129 for converting a sterol to a Compound I. However, this prior art method is not practical as its yield is too low. The present invention is based upon the discovery that by treating Arthrobacter simplex IFO 3530 withN methyl N nitro N nitrosoguanidine a mutant is obtained in which the metabolic system for assimilating indanedionepropionic acid is absent. This may be applied to treat a 3 hydroxy or oxo steroid to obtain a compound I in high yield. Thus, this invention provides, in one aspect, a process for the production of indanedionepropionic acid I , which process comprises permitting a strain ofArthrobacter simplex lacking the metabolic system for assimilating indanedionepropionic acid I to act upon a 3 hydroxy or oxo steroid. The starting 3 hydroxy or oxo steroid used in this invention may be, e.g., cholesterol, sitosterol, campesterol, 1,4 androstadien 3,17 dione, 4 androsten 3, 17 dione, testosterone, progesterone, or a cholic acid. The microorganism used in this invention is a mutant of Arthrobacter simplex lacking the metabolic system for assimilating indanedionepropionic acid I . The invention includes such mutants. Representative of such mutant strains is the strain which may be derived fromArthrobacter simplex IFO 3530 by the use of N methyl N nitro N nitrosoguanidine. This strain is namedArthrobacter simplex ID 38 6 and is on deposit at the Institute of Fermentation Technology, Japan, with DepositNo. BP 260. The deposit is in accordance with theBudapest Treaty and was made on 2nd March 1983. The above new mutant strain is a chemical variant of Arthrobacter simplex IFO 3530, but its morphological and nutritional characteristics are believed to be the same as those of the parent strain.

The invention includes not merely Arthrobacter simplex ID 38 6 but also mutants or variants thereof possessing the ability to produce indanedionepropionic acid I as above and lacking the capability of assimilating the aforesaid acid. Of course, such mutants of Arthrobacter simplexID 38 6 may be deliberately produced, if desired, by standard mutagenic and isolation techniques and need not be naturally occurring. Although not limited thereto, such mutants may have the characteristics of Arthrobacter simplex. In performing the process of the invention, a seed culture may be produced by inoculating such a mutant ofArthrobacter simplex into a nutrient medium. This may then be inoculated into a medium containing the starting steroid, the substrate, and propagated in a conventional manner. The thus cultured broth may be freed from the starting material by, e.g., solvent extraction, acidification of the water layer, extraction in a conventional manner, concentration, and purification in a normal manner to obtain the objective indanedionepropionic acid I . In such production, the steroid concentration is preferably from 0.1 to 0.2 w v . In this concentration region, the yield of indanedionepropionic acid I is usually about 85 to 97 . Naturally, the invention also includes a process for producing a mutant of the invention which comprises treating Arthrobacter simplex IFO 3530 with N methyl N nitro N nitrosoguanidine as a mutagenic agent.
