# MATERIAL BLENDING SYSTEM

## Abstract
A blending bin for particulate having a plurality of vertically extending passageways is provided. Each passage way includes multiple vertically spaced ports. Blending vanes are provided within each passageway to control the proportion of material withdrawn from the bin through the ports. The streams of material are in turn proportionally combined into a single outlet stream. The ports are spaced such that lots of material loaded into the bin will be blended together in the outlet stream and such that thin layers of off grade or non uniform material will not reach dispropor tionate levels in the outlet stream.
