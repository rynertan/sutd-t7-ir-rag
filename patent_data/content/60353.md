## Description
Orthopedic device for use in the prevention and treatment of foot disorders This invention has reference to an orthopedic device for use in the prevention and treatment of foot disorders by mechanical etiology. It is well known that conventional orthopedic devices for the treatment and prevention of foot disorders have been limited essentially to orthopedic soles, i.e. shapes that are inserted in shoes for supporting the plantar arch, or soft soles for relieving the load weighing on the foot in a uniform and restful way. Special mention should be made of the latter anatomical soles made of plastic material, and containing a water based fluid. Manufacturers recommend them particularly for persons who have to stand erect for long periods. Such conventional soles, however, are not free from certain drawbacks they offer a passive support to the plantar arch, by suspending the function and consequently the tone and trophism of the muscles controlling the arch, with consequent yielding of the arch. Such soles therefore act to cause a merely passive lad relief and their comfort derives solely from distributing on the fluid the stress load acting on the user s feet. Nothing in them is provided for preventing or treating foot disorders by mechanical etiology. It should be mentioned that improper use of such supports is often a cause of flatfoot in the child. The device according to the invention is also based upon the laws which govern the distribution of forces in fluids, but it has as its object to prevent and treat foot disorders by mechanical etiology by taking profit from such laws and by optimally distributing forces in fluids in the supporting areas, both in statical and dynamical conditions. The device of the invention substantially comprises a support sole on which are provided containers filled with a gaseous fluid, a glycerine based fluid gel , or containers of a water imbibed sponge, to avoid swashing such containers transmit the forces acting on the support points metatarsal heads, calcaneal tuberosity to the foot s physiological support areas metatarsal necks and plantar arch . Such operation protects the support points from wear and actively corrects any pathological deviations caused by distorted stress lines in the foot, such as in the child s flatfoot. Moreover, a dermo epidermal and subcutaneous massage is effected, which helps to avoid wear effects such as tylomata, callosities, ulcerations, angiolymphatic edemas, etc. The physiological orthopedic device of the invention substantially comprises a sole provided with a first container located in the support area of the calcaneal tuberosity and connected with a second container located in the area of the plantar arch which transmits loads from the heel to the arch, thus relieving the former and actively stressing the latter and with a third, front container, located in an area comprising the metatarsal heads and necks, for shifting stresses from the former to the latter, the third container being connected to an offshoot between the first and second toe, for preventing and or correcting any tendency to hallux valgus. The above device is particularly recommended for persons who are compelled to stand erect for long periods in connection with their work or other special situations salesmen, waiters, housewives, industry workers, chemists, surgeons, etc. . A second embodiment of the device according to the invention is particularly recommendable in early childhood. Such second embodiment of the device comprises a sole provided with a first container located in the support area of the heel extending to the astragalar head and the navicular, and with a second container at the support area of the metatarsal heads extending to near the plantar arch the first container transferring the stresses medially and superiorly at the astragalar head and the navicular in the standing posture and in deambulation, thus stimulating the functions of muscle groups so as to actively cause arch formation the second container concentrating the reaction to metatarsal load stresses at the fourth metatarsal, thus stimulating the helical mechanism tying the function of the so called calcaneal foot with the function of the astragalar foot in the formation of the arch. The invention will now be particularly described with reference to the attached drawings given by way of example, and in which Fig. 1 is a plan view of a first embodiment of the device according to the invention, particularly recommendable for adult use Fig. 2 is a side elevation view of the embodiment ofFig. 1 Fig. 3 is a plan view of a second embodiment of the device according to the invention, particularly recommendable for children s use Fig. 4 is a partially broken side elevation view of the embodiment of Fig. . As shown in Figg. 1 and 2, the device according to the first embodiment of the invention substantially comprises a support sole 2, on which is provided, in the support area of the calcaneal tuberosity, a container 4 filled with a suitable fluid such as glycerine or a gaseous fluid or with a spongy material imbibed with a liquid. Use of glycerine or a similar fluid, or of a liquidimbibed, spongy material, is intended to avoid swashing this bothersome effect is usual in soles provided with containers filled with a water based liquid. Container 4 is connected with a second container 6, located in the arch area, through a duct 8. Container 4 transfers to container 6 the loads acting on the heel, frolr the heel to the plantar arch, thus relieving the former and actively stressing the latter. A third container 10 is provided at the front of sole 2 this is located in an area comprising the metatarsal heads and necks, and thus shifts stresses from the former to the latter. Container 10 has an offshoot 12 between the first and the second toe, which acts to prevent and or to correct any tendency to hallux valgus. As specified above, the embodiment shown in Figg. 1 and 2 and disclosed above is particularly suitable for people compelled to stand erect for long periods, by their work or by other special circumstances salesmen, waiters, housewives, industry workers, chemists, surgeons, etc. . Figg. 3 and 4 show a second embodiment of the invention, particularly suitable for early childhood. According to said second embodiment, the device comprises a sole 14 having a relief 16 at right angles to an horizontal plane in the area of the plantar arch. Sole 14 is provided with a container 18 located in the heel support area and with a second container 23 located in the support area of the metatarsal heads.Container 18 is connected, through a duct 22, to a second container 20 located at the astragalar head and the navicular. Container 23, located in the support area of the metatarsal heads, extends into a container 24 located near the plantar arch. It should be noted that container 20, corresponding roughly to container 6 of the first embodiment Figg. 1 and 2 , is slightly different from it although it is located in the area of the plantar arch, it rests not only on sole 14, but also on wall 16 of the relief, at right angles to the sole container 20 hence reacts along the resulting direction of two components, vertical and horizontal, and therefore substantially in a diagonal direction upon the plantar arch, o more exactly, upon the astragalar head and the navicular. Container 18 transfers stresses medially and superiorly at the astragalar head and the navicular when the user is standing or walking, in order to stimulate the active formation of the arch container 23 concentrates the reactions to the metatarsal load stresses at the fourth metatarsal, in order to stimulate the helical mechanism tying the function of the so called calcaneal foot with that of the astragalar foot in the formation of the arch. In order to give a better understanding of the importance and effectiveness of the invention in all its embodiments, the actions afforded on the foot by the device according to the invention in its various embodiments will now be distinctly pointed out areas subjected to hyperpressure are relieved, with transmission of the baric reaction at the areas that are physiologically dedicated to support loads the foot sole is massaged, with consequent entrophic stimulus and resolution of hypercheratrosic effects such as tylomata or circulation disorders, both in the hematic and the lymphatic systems, such as stasis, edemas and the like adjuvant action in the active formation of the plantar arch or in its correction in early childhood. It should be understood that the invention is not limited to the embodiments shown and described numerous changes and further improvements can be made within the scope of the invention.
