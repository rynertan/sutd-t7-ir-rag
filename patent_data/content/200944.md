# Process for purifying tryptophan.

## Abstract
A process for purifying tryptophan so as to contain almost no unreacted indole and a process for recovering unreacted indole with a very high percentage are provided, the purififaction process comprising passing a reaction fluid of tryptophan prepared from indole as raw material by means of an enzyme function, through a porous type, cation exchange resin layer, to cause the ion exchange part of the resin to adsorb tryptophan, while to cause the porous part of the resin to adsorb indole, followed by eluting only the tryptophan with an alkali or acid aqueous solution, and the recovery process comprising subjecting tryptophan to re peated treatments of adsorption onto and elution from the ion exchange part of the resin and regeneration followed by eluting indole adsorbed onto the porous part of the resin with a water containing organic solvent miscible with water and isolating indole from the resulting elute.
