# A method of observing the pumping characteristics of a positive displacement pump, and a pump enabling the method to be implemented.

## Abstract
The invention relates in particular to measuring the delivery rate of a positive displacement pump comprising at least one piston 3 driven with reciprocating movement in a chamber 2 , which chamber is connected to an inlet circuit 4 via an inlet valve 5 and to an outlet circuit 6 via a delivery valve 7 . The number of cycles performed by the pump in unit time are counted, and simultaneously its volumetric efficiency is measured, thereby enabling its real delivery rate to be deduced. Its volumetric efficiency may be measured by means of position sensors 17, 18 detecting the closure and opening instants of the delivery valve, with another sensor determining the instants at which the piston 3 passes through its end positions.
