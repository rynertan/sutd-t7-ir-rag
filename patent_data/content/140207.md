# A PROCESS FOR RAPIDLY CURING A BROMINATED FLUOROELASTOMER

## Abstract
A process for rapidly curing a fluoroelastomer which comprises mixing and heating a fluoroelastomer copolymer whose interpolymerized units consist essentially of viny lidene fluoride, at least one other fluorine containing monomer copolymerizable therewith, said monomer being a compound which contains 2 7 carbon atoms, contains no bromine, and contains at least as many fluorine atoms as carbon atoms and contains up to 3 mole percent of units derived from a bromine containing olefin a quaternary phosphonium compound a bisphenol or an ammonium or phosphonium salt thereof and a dialkylaminopyridine or a diazabicyclo compound having the formula
