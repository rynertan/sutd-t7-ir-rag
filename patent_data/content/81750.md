# Self clocking serial decoder.

## Abstract
A self clocking serial decoder for generating clocking pulses from serially transmitted data in which a level shift recurs with each bit is disclosed. The circuit uses a coin cidence of data word recognition and initial level shift to generate an initial clock pulse and thereafter uses the de layed clock pulses and level shift to produce subsequent clock pulses. A data word recognition circuit is also dis closed that employs a delay line for examining the profile of a synchronizing wave form.
