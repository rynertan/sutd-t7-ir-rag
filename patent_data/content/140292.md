# Image sensing system with noise eliminator.

## Abstract
A solid state image sensor has an electrically floating carrier detecting electrode 12 formed on a substrate 10 , into which the signal carriers are transmitted, a sense amplifier circuit 14 detecting the variation in a voltage of the electrode 12 at the time of transferring the carriers, and a resetting electrode RS for resetting the potential of the electrode 12 to a predetermined potential at every read out period of the picture element section. A circuit arrangement 36 for removing noise is provided to have two switches S1, S2 which switch to alternatively become conductive in response to control pulse signals 40 1, 40 2 . The first switch S1 becomes conductive during a first period within one picture element period. During the first period the CCD output signal contains an effective image signal component. The second switch S2 becomes conductive during a second period during which the CCD output signal contains a reset noise component, thereby forcibly fixing the level of the reset noise signal to a DC reference potential Vd so that reset noise can be removed.
