## Description
FLUOROCARBON ANION EXCHANGERS AND PROCESSES FOR THEIRPREPARATION The present invention relates to novel highly durable anion exchangers having quaternary ammonium groups Anion exchangers, particularly membrane type anion exchangers, are practically used in the fields of e.g.electrodialysis, diffusion dialysis and various electric cells. For such membrane type ion exchangers, it has been common to employ a copolymer or a polymer mixture obtainable by a various combination of hydrocarbon monomers, to which anion exchange groups have been introduced by a polymer reaction. However, such conventional anion exchangers are likely to be materially deteriorated when subjectd to severe conditions, for instance, then used in the presence of e.g. chlorine or a strong base, or when subjected to the repetition of swelling and contruction.Therefore, it is desired to develop an anion exchanger which is durable even under such severe conditions. As a membrane type anion exchanger developed to improve the durability, there has been known an exchanger prepared by mixing a fluorinated polymer such as poly tetrafluoroethylene and an inorganic anion exchanger such as a hydrate of zirconium oxide, and press molding the mixture Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No.35079 1975 . However, the ion exchange capacity of an inorganic anion exchanger composed of such an amphoteric metal oxide is usually largely dependent on the hydrogen ion concentration in the environment in which it is used.In some cases, an inversion of the ion exchange ability will take place. For instance, the hydrate of zirconium oxide acts as an anion exchanger at a pH of 6 or less, but it acts as a cation exchanger at a pH greater than 6.Further, it exhibits no substantial ion exchange ability under a neutral condition. Thus, the condition under which the membrane type anion exchanger comprising such an ion exchanger may be used, is substantially restricted. Further, it is also known to obtain a durable membrane by fluorinating the surface of a hydrocarbon anion exchange membrane Japanese Unexamined patentPublication No. 4489 1977 . However, according to this method, it is usually difficult to accomplish adequate fluorination, and it is therby hardly possible to obtain an anion exchange membrane having adequate properties required for practical industrial purposes. In view of the superior durability of the fluorinated polymer, the present inventors have conducted extensive researches to develop an anion exchanger using the fluorinated polymer as the base material, and have invented an anion exchanger having superior durability and a process for its preparation. Namely, the present invention provides a fluorocarbon anion exchanger which is composed of a quaternary ammonium type polymer comprising a perfluorocarbon main chain and a pendant chain attached to the main chain, characterized in that the pendant chain has a quaternary ammonium type terminal group represented by the formula EMI3.1 where R1 is a lower alkyl group, an aromatic group or an alkyl group containing quaternary ammonium group s , R2 is a lower alkyl group, an aromatic group or a hydroxy lower alkyl group, or R1 and R2 together form a tetramethylene or pentamethylene group, R3 is a lower alkyl group, R4 is a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl group or an alkyl group containing quaternary ammonium group s , a is an integer of 2 to 5, and Z is a counter ion for the quaternary ammonium ion. The quaternary ammonium type polymer which composes the fluorocarbon anion exchanger can be prepared by a process which comprises reacting sulfonamide group containing fluorocarbon polymer comprising a perfluorocarbon main chain and a pendant chain attached to the main chain and having a terminal group represented by the formula EMI4.1 where R11 is a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl group, an aromatic group or an alkyl group containing amino group s , R is a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl group, an aromatic group or a hydroxy lower alkyl group, or R1 and R21 together form a tetramethylene or pentamethylene 4 group, R is a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl group or an alkyl group containing amino group s , a is an integer of 2 to 5, with an alkylating agent to convert the terminal group of the formula II to the terminal group of the formula I. The sulfonamide group containing fluorocarbon polymer having terminal groups of the formula II can be prepared by a process which comprises reacting a fluorocarbon polymer comprising a perfluorocarbon main chain and having a fluorosulfonyl terminal group with an amine represented by the formula EMI4.2 where R1 , R2 R4 and a are as defined above, to convert the fluorosulfonyl terminal group to the terminal group of the formula II. the formula II. In this specification, the pendant chain is meant for a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group, a perfluoro alkyl group or an aromatic group, which is attached to a main chain of a perfluorocarbon polymer. A hetero atom or an organic ring may be present between the carbon carbon bond of the pendant chain. An alkyl group containing quaternary ammonium group s is meant for an alkyl group which contains not less than one, preferably from one to five nitrogen atoms whose all chemical bonds are made between hydrogen atom s or carbon atoms amine nitrogen atom s and from one to all of the nitrogen atom may be quaternized.As the concrete examples, the following structures can be illustrated EMI5.1 EMI6.1 An alkyl group containing amino group s is meant for an alkyl group which contains not less than one, preferably from one to five amine nitrogen atoms in its alkyl chain.The following structures can be illustrated as the concrete examples EMI6.2 Now, the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the preferred embodiments. In a typical quaternary ammonium type anion exchanger of the present invention, the pendant chains have a structure represented by the formula EMI7.1 where X is a fluorine atom, a chlorine atom or a CF3 group, Qis an integer of 0 to 5, m is 0 or 1, n is an integer of 1 to 5, and, Q is as defined above. The integers Q, m and n may be the same or different among the pendant groups. Namely,, the respective pendant groups have the same integers Q, m and n when they are derived from the same fluoroolefin monomer, whereas they have different integers Q, m and n when they are derived from different fluoroolefin monomers, as in the case or a copolymer prepared by copolymerizing at least two fluoroolefin monomers having different , m and n with a main chain forming perfluorocarbon monomer. In the quaternary ammonium type anion exchanger of the present invention, the main chain is preferably a linear perfluorocarbon random polymer chain which comprises repeating units represented by the formula EMI7.2 where p is an integer of 3 to 16, q is an integer of 1 to 10, and the ratio of p q is within a range of from 2 to 16 where p is an average value of all p in the repeating units and q is an average value of all q in the repeating units. Accordingly, a preferred quaternary ammonium type anion exchanger of the present invention is composed of a polymer comprises repeating units represented by the formula EMI8.1 where p, q, X, Q, m, n and a are as defined above and each of R1 and R2 is a lower alkyl group such as methyl, ethyl, n or i propyl, or n , i , s or t butyl an aromatic group such as phenyl, tolyl, p chlorophenyl, pmethoxyphenyl, furyl or thienyl or a hydroxy lower alkyl group such as 2 hydroxyethyl, 2 hydroxy n propyl or 3hydroxy n propyl or R1 and R2 together form a tetramethylene or pentamethylene group R3 is a lower alkyl group such as methyl, ethyl, n or i propyl, or n , i , s or t butyl, which is derived from an alkylating agent mentioned hereinafter R4 is a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl group such as methyl, ethyl, n or i propyl, or n , i , s or t butyl or an alkyl group containing quaternary ammonium group s as mentioned above and Z is a counter ion for the quaternary ammonium ion, e.g. an anion of a halogen atom such as bromine or iodine a super strong acid ion such as tetrafluoroboric acid ion, hexachloroantimonic acid ion or a trifluoromethane sulfonic acid ion a sulfonic acid ion such as a benzenesulfonic acid ion or a toluenesulfonic acid ion a carboxylic acid ion such as an acetic acid ion or a monoalkylsulfuric acid ion. From the viewpoint of usefulness as the ionexchanger, it is preferred that the pendant chain has a terminal group of the formulae EMI9.1 The quaternary ammonium type fluorocarbon polymer which composes the fluorocarbon anion exchanger of the present invention may have, for example, the following repeating units EMI10.1 EMI11.1 EMI12.1 EMI13.1 EMI14.1 EMI15.1 The quaternary ammonium type fluorocarbon polymer which composes the fluorocarbon anion exchanger of the present invention contains a hydrocarbon group as a part thereof. Nevertheless, it is extremely resistant to oxidation, particularly oxidation by chlorine, and durable against bases, as well as being resistant to solvents.Further, even when subjected to the repetition of the contraction by drying and the swelling in a solvent inclusive of water , it undergoes no substantial property change, and its handling is very easy as compared with conventional anion exchangers. For instance, in the form of a membrane, the quaternary ammonium type polymer of the present invention is useful for applications for which conventional anion exchange membranes are hardly useful, e.g. as a diaphragm for an organic electrolytic reaction, or as a membrane for various dialyses conducted under severe conditions. It is useful in various forms as a resin which is capable of performing anion exchange with the quaternary ammonium ions in the presence of various solvents.Furthermore, it is useful as a catalyst for various reactions, for instance, as a catalyst for the synthesis of cyanohydrin, as an phase transfer catalyst, or as a halogenation reaction catalyst. Further, in a tubular form, the anion exchange of the present invention may be employed as a multi tube module in a space saving dialysis apparatus. It is useful also for an undesirable anion removal system in an ion chromatography. The anion exchange membrane of the present invention may have a greater number of ion exchange groups per a pendant group than the membrane from which it is prepared, which results in a lower membrane electric resistance, thus providing an additional advantage that it gives a low cell voltage, when used for electrolysis. Thus, the quaternary ammonium type fluorocarbon anion exchanger of the present invention has a significant industrial value by virtue of the superior durability, etc. The quaternary ammonium type polymer which composes the fluorocarbon anion exchanger can be prepared by a process which comprises reating a sulfonamide group containing fluorocarbon polyemr comprising a perfluorocarbon main chain and a pendant chain attached to the main chain and having a terminal group represented by the formula EMI17.1 where each of R11 is a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl group, an aromatic group or an alkyl group containing amino group s , R is a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl group, an aromatic group or a hydroxy lower alkyl group, or R1 and R2 together form a tetramethylene of pentamethylene group, R is a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl group or an alkyl group cotnaining amino group s , a is an integer of 2 to 5 , with an alkylating agent to convert the terminal group of the formula II to the terminal group of the formula I. As the alkylating agent, there may be mentioned a lower alkyl iodide or bromide, an ester of a strong acid, or a tri lower alkyl oxonium salt of a super acid, such as methyl iodide, ethyl bromide, n propyl bromide, n butyl iodide, trimethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate CH3 30BF4 , triethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate C2H5 30BF4 , trimethyloxonium hexachloroantimonate CE3 30SbC16 , dimethyl sulfate, methyl trifluoroacetate, methyl trifluoromethanesulfonate, methyl p toluenesulfonate or ethyl p nitrobenzenesulfonate. For the alkylation, there may be employed a solvent such as methanol, ethanol, methylene chloride, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, tetrahydrofuran, sulforane, N,N dimethylformamide DMF , nitromethane orN methyl 2 pyrrolidone NMP . The alkylation can be conducted under conditions which are commonly employed in alkylation of this type.For instance, it can readily be carried out by contacting the sulfonamide group containing fluorocarbon polymer as the starting material, with the alkylating agent or its solution at a temperature of from about 0 to about 100 C. The alkylating agent is used in an amount of at least a stoichiometric amount, preferably at least twice the stoichiometric amount, relative to the amino group to be converted to the quaternary ammonium group. In order to let the reaction proceed quickly and completely, it is common to employ the alkylating agent in a large excess amount. When a solvent is employed, it is advisable to use it in a sufficient amount so that the fluorocarbon polymer is adequately immersed therein. The alkylation reaction may vary depending upon species of the alkylating agent used, and the reaction condition such as temperature, solvent, etc., but it may usually be conducted under the above mentioned conditions for about 10 hours to about 5 days. Z in the formula I is a counter ion for the quaternary ammonium ion, which is usually derived also from the alkylating agent. As such a counter ion, there may be mentioned an anion of a halogen atom, such as bromine or iodine, a super strong acid ion such as a tetrafluoroboric acid ion, a hexachloroantimonic acid ion or a trifluoromethanesulfonic acid ion, a sulfonic acid ion such as a benzenesulfonic acid ion or a toluenesulfonic acid ion, a carboxylic acid ion such as an acetic acid ion, or a monoalkylsulfuric acid ion. These counter ions may be substituted by other ions, as the case requires.The substitution of ions can readily be made by a conventional method, for example, by treating the quaternary ammonium type fluorocarbon polymer obtained by the process of the present invention, with an alkali metal salt such as NaCl, Lick, LiBr, LiI, NaOH, KOH, NANS, or K2SO4. The starting fluorocarbon polymer having terminal groups of the formula II may be used in any desired form such as in a flat membrane form, a tubular form, a fiber form or a powder form, whereby the final quaternary ammonium type polymer is obtainable in the corresponding form. Thus, an anion exchanger of the quaternary ammonium type polymer may be obtained in any desired form by so selecting the form of the starting material. The sulfonamide group containing fluorocarbon polyemr having terminal groups of the formula II can be prepared by a process which comprises reacting a fluorocarbon polymer comprising a perfluorocarbon main chain and having a fluorosulfonyl terminal group with an amine represented by the formula EMI20.1 where R11, R2 , R4 and a are as defined above, to convert the halosulfonyl terminal group to the terminal group of the formula II. The fluorocarbon polymer having fluorosulfonyl terminal groups used as the starting material preferably has pendant chains represented by the formula EMI20.2 where X, Q, m and n are as defined above. A typical main chain of the polymer is a linear perfluorocarbon random polymer chain which comprises repeating units represented by the formula EMI21.1 where p is an integer of 3 to 15, and q is an integer of 1 to 10. Accordingly, a preferred polymer has repeating units represented by the formula EMI21.2 where X, Q, m, n, p and q are as defined above. As specific exmaples of the fluorocarbon polymer having fluorosulfonyl terminal groups, there may be mentioned those having the following repeating units EMI21.3 EMI22.1 EMI23.1 These fluorocarbon polymers are well known as precursors of sulfonicacid type cation exchange perfluorocarbon polymers particularly as cation exchange membranes for the electrolysis of sodium chloride . As the amine of the formula III to be used for the above reaction, there may be mentioned methylamine, N,N dimethyl 1,3 propanediamine, N,N diethyl 1,3propanediamine, N ethyl N methyl 1,3 propanediamine, N isobutyl N methyl 1,3 propanediamine, N,N,N trimethyl 113 propanediamine, N,N dimethyl N propyl 1,3 propanediamine, N 3 aminopropyl 2 pipecoline, 3 pyrrolidino propylamine, 3 piperidinopropylamine, N,N dimethyl 1,4 butanediamine, diethylenetriamine, triethylenetetramine, tetraethylenepentamine, N,N dimethyldiethylenetriamine, di trimethylene triamine, N,N dimethyl di trimetbylene triamine, N,N,N ,N tetramethyl di trimethylene triamine, N ethyl N methyl di trimethylene triamine, N,N dimethyl tri trimethylene tetramine, N N ,N dimethylamino propyl ethylenediamine, N aminoethyl piperazine, N aminopropyl N methylpiperazine, N,N bis dimethyl aminoethyl 1,4 phenylenediamine, N pyrrolidinoethyltriethylenetetramine, N 3,3 bis N ,N dimethyl aminomethyl propyl propanediamine, or N,N dimethyl 1,S pentanediamine.Instead of these amines, the corresponding silyl amines obtained by substituting the hydrogen atoms on the nitrogen atoms of the amine of the formula V by a trimethylsilyl group, may also be used. The reaction with the amine may be conducted in a liquid amine or by means of a solvent. The amine is used in an amount of at least a stoichiometric amount, preferably at least three times the stoichiometric amount, more preferably in a great excess, relative to the starting material. The reaction may be conducted in the presence of a tertiary amine. As the solvent, there may be employed an ether such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran dimethoxyethane or dioxane a hydrocarbon such as benzene, toluene or hexane acetonitrile or dimethylsulfoxide. The solvent is used in a sufficient amount so that the fluorocarbon polymer having the fluorosulfonyl groups is adequately immersed therein. It may be used in an excess amount. The reaction temperature is not critical. However, it is common to conduct the reaction at atempeature of from about 300C to about 1500C, preferably from about 0 0C to 80 C.
