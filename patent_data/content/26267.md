# Method and apparatus for compressing and decompressing strings of electrical binary data bits.

## Abstract
A compression technique for a character graphics system in which character cell definition bit strings are transmitted from a central processing unit 1 to a display unit 6 . Each cell is divided into a number of slices and each slice into digits. A test is made on whether to compress on a comparison with an all zero slice, the previous slice or the previous slice but one, depending upon the number of digit mismatches that occur when the comparison occurs. Slices are then compressed by comparing each digit with the corresponding digit in the comparison slice and generating a single 0 bit if the digit matches and including a 1 bit and the whole digit if a mis match occurs. The compression in the central processing unit and the decompression in the display unit is implemented in microcoded routines.
