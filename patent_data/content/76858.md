# PHOTOELECTRIC CONVERSION TYPE PULSE ENCODER.

## Abstract
In a photoelectric conversion type pulse encoder having incident light units 13, 13 , a rotary slit plate 12 provided with a lattice plate for receiving light from the incident units, a stationary slit plate 11 provided with a lattice plate disposed to face the above lattice plate, and light receiving units 14, 14 disposed under the stationary slit plate, light is supplied from a light emitting circuit through an optical fiber 17 to the incident light units 13, 13 , the light received by the light receiving units 14, 14 is introduced through the optical fiber 17 to a photodetect ing circuit, the adjustment for the quantity of light can be thus simplified, pulses responsive to the speed of rotation can be effectively generated, and the speed of rotation can be accurately detected.
