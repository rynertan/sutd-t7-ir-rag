## Description
WAIVING AID P00 DEVICEThis invention relates to foot devices for walking aids such as walking sticks, crutches or the like of the kind wherein a mounting member of the device for fitting to the lower end of a walking stick, crutch or like leg has a ball and socket connection with a foot member to permit their relative angular movement in a universal manner whereby greatly increased resistance to slipping of the foot member on the ground, or a floor or similar surface is obtained even when a walking stick, crutch or other walking aid fitted with the device is at a considerable angle to the ground or floor.The object of this invention is to provide improved constructions and arrangements of such a device of a simple and highly effective nature.According to this invention a foot device of the kind referred to for a walking aid such as a walking stick, crutch or the like and comprising a mounting member for fitting to the lower end of a walking stick, crutch or like leg and having a ball shaped member extending therefrom and retentively received by a co operating socket of an anti slip foot member for their relative universal angular movement, is characterised in this that the mounting member is of rubber or similar resilient material and provides a socket for receiving the lower end of a walking stick or crutch or like leg inserted therein with a gripping fit and the ball shaped member extends by a shank from an integral disc like head located or moulded in the mounting member at the inner end of the socket therein for direct contact with the lower end of a walking stick or crutch or like leg inserted therein whereby weight on the walking stick, erutch or like leg is transmitted directly to the ball and socket connection.Practical examDles of the invention are shown in the accompanying drawings in which FIGURE 1 is a side elevation of one form of the device shown fitted to a walking stick,FIGURE 2 is an enlarged scale axial plane sectional detail view of the foot device, and FIGURES 3 to 7 are axial plane sectional views similar to FIGURE 2 but each showing developments or modifications. Like parts are referred to by the same or similar reference numerals throughout the drawings. Referring to FIGURE 1 the foot member 1 of the device is in the nature of a disc having an anti slip face 10 at its underside and formed or provided with a socket 12 at its upperside for retentively receiving a ball shaped lower extremity or projection 20 of a mounting member or ferrule 2 having a socket 23 which has a tight push fit on the lower end of a walking stick 3.The ball and socket connection 20, 12 provides a considerable extent of universal pivotal movement of the mounting member 2 and hence angular movement of the stick 3, relative to the foot 1 in any direction. The facing of the underside of the foot 1 preferably has a tread formation or pattern 100 on its underface at 10 for anti slip contact with the floor, ground or with similar surfaces such as on stairways.The action of the device is such that despite considerable inclination of the stick 3 relative to the floor F the anti slip underside 10 of the foot 1 remains flatly in full face contact with the floor F for maximum resistance to slipping e.g. under the weight of a person adopting a leaning attitude on the stick. Practical tests have established that an effective anti slip action is obtained even on smooth surfaces such as tiled or similar floors.The full contact obtained and maintained by means of the device according to this invention is provided in a self accommodating manner by the universal pivotal action of the ball and socket connection 20, 12. Furthermore the stick 3 is able to turn or swivel about its axis relative tothe foot 1 so that freedom of movement is afforded i.e. when a person using the fitted stick 3 changes direction in which he or she is facing.As shown in FIGURE 2 the mounting member 2 is moulded or otherwise produced in rubber, plastic or other suitable resilient material so as to have a gripping push fit on the lower end of a walking stick 3 or leg of a crutch.The socket 23 of the mounting member 2 is also shown provided with raised formation at 230 for gripping engagement about the stick 3 or leg.Located in an annular groove 22 at the base of the socket 23 of the mounting member 2 or preferably moulded therein is a head or disc 220 from which the ball shaped projection 20 depends by a shank 200. The arrangement is such that the lower end of the stick 3 or leg directly contacts the disc 220 so that the weight of a person on the stick or crutch is directly transmitted to the ball 20 and foot 1.The foot 1 is also moulded or otherwise produced in rubber or the like and is directly formed with the antislip face 10 at its underside. The foot 1 contains an insert 120 of harder wear resistant material e.g. nylon providing the socket 12 which receives the ball 20 with a retentive snap fit. The insert 120 is moulded in the foot 1 and is shown of conical form for retention therein.The tread projections 100 of the anti slip underface 10 are shown of taper form to facilitate moulding and also for ease of cleaning.The lower end of the mounting member 2 is shown provided with a yieldable depending member or skirt 21 which abuts the upper inclined face of the foot 1. In addition to imparting a neat appearance to the device and nrotectively enclosing the ball and socket engagement 20, 12 from dirt, the skirt 21 tends to maintain the foot 1 axially aligned with the mounting member 2 and stick 3 yet readily permits relative inclination as required under conditions of use. In particular the skirt 21 prevents or minimises undue pivotal movement of the foot 1 when it is raised from the ground during walking and ensures that the foot 1 is in a suitable attitude for further antislip contact with the ground.The skirt 21 may be of rubber or like resilient material and is shown formed integrally with the moulded mounting member 2.In FIGURE 3 the skirt 21 is shown inwardly directed or curved where it abuts the upperside of the foot 1 in order to prevent or minimise gapping of the skirt 21 from the foot 1 on their relative inclination. The base of the insert 120 is shown flanged for retention in the foot 1.The diameter of the foot 1 may be varied according to requirements, a larger size being normally used on a crutch compared with that for a walking stick.Instead of being directly formed with an anti slip face 10 at its underside the foot 1 may receive a cap of rubber or like material with a retentive engagement or snap fit to provide an anti slip underface, which cap can be readily removed or peeled off when worn for replacement by a new cap or an alternative form of cap. Thus a cap or foot having a spiked underside may be provided for use as necessary on very slippery surfaces such as on ice covered surfaces.The foot device shown in FIGURE 4 is generally similar to that of FIGURE 3 except that the mounting member 2 is of locally increased diameter in the vicinity of the head or disc 220. The latter is also shown provided with an upstanding central spike 223 for locating engagement with the lower end of a wooden walking stick 3 or with a plug of similar material provided in the end of a tubular leg of a crutch. A further feature of the arrangement of FIGURE 4 is the provision of a sleeve or gaiter 4 of rubber or other resilient material about the shank 200, an outwardly flared lower part 40 of the gaiter 4 protectively closing the top of the socket 12 in the insert 120 and ball 20 therein in order to directly seal the ball and socket engagement from ingress of dirt yet readily permit their relative angular movement in any direction. The spike 223 may be provided in any of the arrangements shown in FIGURES 1 to 3 and the gaiter 4 in the arrangement of FIGURE 3e In FIGURE 5 the arrangement is again generally similar to those already described however the gaiter 44 has a strong er resilient action and bears on the top of the socket insert 120 to not only provide sealing against dirt but also to urge the foot 1 back to the axially aligned position after relative inclination of the stick 3 or crutch and as the foot 1 is raised from contact with the ground. The need for the skirt 21 to perform this function is no longer necessary and is shown of shorter form with a clearance between it and the upperside of the foot 1. The skirt 21 in this instance is able to flex to permit pronounced inclination of the stick 3 or crutch relative to the foot 1.Referring to FIGURE 6 a gaiter 440 of flared form and again having a stronger resilient action is shown for urging the foot 1 to the axially aligned position and also seal the ball and socket engagement 20, 12. In this example the skirt 21 is virtually dispensed with.In an alternative arrangement of resiliently providing the axial alignment and sealing of the ball and socket engagement 20, 12 an upward tubular piece or extension 14 of the rubber or similar foot 1 enters an underside recess 24 of the socket member 2 about the shank 200 and bears against the underface of the disc or head 220 with a resilient yielding action. The inner wall of the recess 24 or skirt 210 so provided abuts the exterior of the tubular extension 14 with a resilient action on pronounced inclination of the stick 3 or crutch relative to the foot 1.In FIGURES 6 and 7 the disc head 220 is shown perforated at 222 for positive moulding into the rubber of the mounting member 2. Such perforation may be provided in the disc heads 220 of the arrangements shown in FIGURES 1 to 5. Further in the intersts of stability and in all the embodiments of the invention herein described, the centre of the ball and socket connection is situated close to the underside 10 of the foot 1 and hence to a floor or similar surface F on which it bears in use.The effective anti slip action obtained ensures more positive and safer support of a person using a stick or sticks or crutches fitted with the device especially in the case of a crippled or disabled person and gives the latter a much greater degree of confidence. The device can be inexpensively produced and can also be of compact, unobtrusive form of adequate strength and durability to withstand hard usage.
