# METHOD OF MANUFACTURING MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES AND CELLS CAPABLE OF MANUFACTURING SUCH ANTIBODIES

## Abstract
The invention lies in the field of monoclonal antibodies and other lymphocyte products. A method of producing a monoclonal antibody and other lymphocyte products comprises fusing together lym phocytes sensitized against a target antigen and tumour like cells which have been treated to eliminate therein an enzymic activity essential to their survival in the free state to form a mixture of hybrid cells and unfused lymphocytes and tumour like cells. The mixture is then suspended in a cell culture medium in which the hybrid cells grow and the unfused lymphocytes and tumour like cells die. Antibody produced by the hybrid cells may be extracted and used to treat patients suffering from a disease resulting from the presence of the target antigen.
