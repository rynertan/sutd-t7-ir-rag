## Description
The present invention relates to a multilayer wiring substrate and, more particularly, to a multilayer wiring substrate having a plurality of power supply wiring layers. An example of conventional ceramic multilayer wiring substrates is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,245,273. The prior art substrate has a plurality of integrated circuit IC chips on the top surface thereof, a plurality of input output I O pins used as I O terminals, a plurality of power pins used as power supply terminals on the bottom surface of said substrate, and a plurality of power supply wiring layers provided therein to supply predetermined different voltages to the IC chips and other electrical components provided on the substrate. However, as described later in detail by referring to the drawings, the laminated structure of the power supply wiring layers in the prior art substrate has a disadvantage in that it is not easy to obtain the predetermined voltage from a desired power supply wiring layer at a desired location on the substrate. Another disadvantage of the prior art substrate is that when the signal wiring layers and the insulating layers formed by a thick film technique using inorganic insulating paste are alternately formed on the substrate, the resistance values of via hole wirings for power supply, which penetrate the insulating layers, are undesirably larger because of a large thickness of each of the insulating layers. EP A 0.099.544 discloses a multi level interconnection packaging structure for mounting large scale integrated circuit semiconductor device chips. The structure comprises a multi layer ceramic body, a multi level interconnection layer on top of the body, and a plurality of input output pins on the bottom of the body. Within the body are multiple layers of conductive patterns connected by vias. The interconnection layer provides a smaller grid size of a denser interconnection on the top surface of the ceramic body. It includes first and second levels of conductive patterns spaced by a dielectric layer and via studs which connect the first and second level conductive patterns. Pads for mounting integrated circuit chips are included in the second level patterns. An object of the present invention is to provide a substrate free from the above mentioned disadvantages of the prior art substrate. According to the present invention, there is provided a multilayer wiring substrate comprising a ceramic substrate 1 containing a plurality of power supply wiring layers a h , a signal wiring layer section 2 on top of the ceramic substrate 1 and a plurality of terminals 20 on the bottom of the ceramic substrate 1 , wherein the said plurality of power supply wiring layers a h comprise a first group 11 of power supply wiring layers for supplying a plurality of different voltages, respectively, the wiring layers in the first group 11 being parallel arranged and vertically spaced, and a plurality of first insulating layers for insulating the wiring layers in the first group from each other and a second group 12 of power supply wiring layers which are in one to one correspondence with the layers in the first group 11 , the wiring layers in the second group 12 being parallel arranged, vertically spaced and located vertically above the first group, and a plurality of second insulating layers for insulating the wiring layers in the second group from each other a plurality of first via hole wirings 23,25,27,29 connect each of the power supply wiring layers in the first group to a corresponding one of the power supply wiring layers in the second group and a plurality of second via hole wirings 22,24,26,28 connect said terminals 20 to said power supply wiring layers in said first group 11 said signal wiring layer section 2 comprises a plurality of thin film signal wiring layers 41,42,43 , a plurality of third insulating layers 51,52,53 for insulating the signal wiring layers, and a plurality of third via hole wirings 61,62,63 for connecting said signal wiring layers to each other, to form a plurality of internal wirings each having one end 44 exposed on a top surface of the signal wiring layer section and the other end 41 connected to one of said second power supply wiring layers 12 . The invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Referring to Fig. 1, a prior art ceramic multilayer wiring substrate 110 comprises a first power supply wiring layer 111 connected to via hole wirings 131 and 134 whose one ends are exposed on the bottom surface of the substrate 110 and connected to via hole wirings 132 and 133 whose one ends are exposed on the top surface of the substrate 110 a second power supply wiring layer 112 connected to a via hole wiring 141 where one end is exposed on the top surface of the substrate 110 and connected to a via hole wiring 142 whose one end is exposed on the bottom surface of the substrate 110 and a third power supply wiring layer 113 connected to a via hole wiring 151 whose one end is exposed on the bottom surface of the substrate 110 and connected to a through hole wiring 152 penetrating through the substrate 110. The prior art substrate further includes a fourth power supply wiring layer 114 connected to a through hole wiring 161 penetrating through the substrate 110, a plurality of insulating layers 120 for insulating the wiring layers 111 through 114 from one another, and a plurality of signal wiring layers 115. In the prior art substrate, when a power supply wiring layer for example, the wiring layer 112 is connected to the wiring layer 115 through the via hole wiring 141 at a location on the top surface of the substrate, another power supply wiring layer for example, the wiring layer 111 , arranged on a plane which is closer to the top surface of the substrate 110 than the wiring layer 112, cannot be connected to the through hole wiring 151 located opposite to the via hole wiring 141. As a result, it is not easy to obtain the predetermined voltage from a desired power supply wiring layer at a desired location on the top surface of the substrate 110. Referring to Fig. 2, an embodiment of the invention comprises a ceramic multilayer wiring section 1 and a thin film multilayer wiring section 2. The section 1 comprises pin shaped terminals 20 through hole wirings 21 connected to some of the terminals 20 to perform the transmission of signals given to or from the section 2 via hole wirings 22 and 23 connected to first power supply wiring layers Such a structure allows arbitrary connection of any of the terminals 20 to any of the power supply wiring layers in the first group 11 as well as arbitrary connection of any of via hole wirings arranged at arbitrary positions on the top surface of the section 1 to any of the power supply wiring layers in the second group 12. For example, in the part surrounded by a dashed line X in Fig. 2, the first group 11 alone cannot directly connect the wiring layer In the embodiment, the thin film multilayer wiring section 2 formed on the section 1 comprises thin film signal wiring layers 41, 42, 43 and 44 made of gold or copper polyimide insulating layers 51, 52 and 53 made of a polyimide material for insulating the signal wiring layers from each other and via fills 61, 62 and 63 composed of a mixture of gold and polyimide. Since a polyimide insulating film has a superior insulation property as compared to the insulating film formed by printing and sintering inorganic paste, sufficient insulation can be achieved by the use of a thin polyimide insulating film. for example, a fifteen micron thick polyimide insulating film can achieve the same insulation ability as an inorganic insulating film of a sixty micron thickness. As a result, the resistance of the via hole wiring penetrating such a thinner polyimide insulating film can be reduced.
