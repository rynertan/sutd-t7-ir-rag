# Recoil energy recovery system, e.g. for ordnance.

## Abstract
Ordnance recoil energy is collected as a gas pressure increase in a recuperator 36 . A portion of the pressurized gas energy is used for counter recoil to return the recoil mass 32 to the battery position. An energy transfer means 50, 34 is operative subsequent to completion of the counter recoil movement to utilize the remaining gas pressure energy by means of a floating interface piston 34 , to pressurize hydraulic fluid in a hydraulic fluid chamber 25 , which may then supply an accumulator. Use of this two stage gas hydraulic system can be more efficient than direct pumping, since recoil energy can be stored more readily by pressurizing gas with less frictional loss, and thereafter the stored gas pressure more slowly charges the hydraulic pressure system at a rate that reduces energy losses. The disclosed energy recovery system can also be of general application, e.g. in industrial explosive forming.
