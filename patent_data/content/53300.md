# RF shielded door seal.

## Abstract
A door seal for a room shielded against electromagnet ic radiation in which the door is mounted on a frame to move between open and closed positions. The door may be slidable or hinged. The door seal is formed of peripheral flexible plates that are welded together on their outer edges. Spaced between the plates and between the frame and the door there is a peripheral tubular bladder which when expanded with compressed air, for example, forces the plates outwardly against the door and the frame to form a seal. A seal is also formed within the plates by the bladder forced thereagainst. There are a series of peripherally spaced magnets adapted to hold the door sealing plate away from the door, when the bladder is not expanded. When the bladder is expanded, the plate is moved off of the magnets by the force of the expanding bladder. The force of the magnets on the plate is rendered ineffective as the bladder moves the plate away from the magnets and the effectiveness of the magnetic force is substantially increased as the bladder is unexpanded so that the plate is allowed to be withdrawn from the door by the force of the magnets.
