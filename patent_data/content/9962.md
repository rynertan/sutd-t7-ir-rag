# Display arrangements.

## Abstract
A display arrangement consists of a cathode ray tube 1 in which electrons from a flood gun 2 pass through a segmented mesh electrode 7, different portions of which can be selec tively switched to enable the electrons to reach only selected portions of a fluorescent screen 3. As very low switching voltages are applied to the mesh electrode 7 to control the passage of electrons from the flood gun 2, the cathode 23 is heated to the temperature at which electrons are emitted by the application of relatively short high current pulses pro duced by a drive circuit 25. Electrons are allowed to pass through the mesh electrode 7 only during the intervals bet ween these pulses.
