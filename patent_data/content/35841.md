# A SHORTED EMITTER THYRISTOR DEVICE

## Abstract
In a thyristor device 1 the dynamic characteristics, e.g. critical dV dt, of the thyristor may be improved by means of shorts 2 between the base layer 4 and the emitter metallisa tion layer 9 . Such shorts, however, slow the rate of conduc tion spreading. To overcome this the series resistance Rs of the shorts 2 is made at least equal to the maximum effective lateral resistance Ra of the base layer between the shorts 2 by means of a layer 7 of resistive material provided between the upper surface of the columns 3 of the shorts 2 and the emitter metallisation layer 9 . The resistive material may be silicon of the same type as the base layer 4 but possessing higher resistivity or a cermet film. In another form in the upper surface of the columns 3 of the shorts 2 , in contact with metallisation layer 9 , a moat 13 surrounding a central land 12 is etched to leave only a relatively small contact area.
