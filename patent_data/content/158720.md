## Description
SYNERGISTIC PRODUCTION OF CARBOXYLIC ACIDS FROM ORGANIC FORMATE ESTEBS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The production of organic compounds using carbon monoxide or synthesis gas, which is a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, as reactant has been known for a significant period of time. It is well known that one can produce methanol directly from synthesis gas and that methanol can be further reacted by hydroformylation, homologation and carbonylation reactions to produce acetaldehyde, ethanol and acetic acid or its methyl ester, respectively. It is also known that esters, ethers, and other organic compounds can be reacted with carbon monoxide or synthesis gas to produce oxygenated organic compounds.The difficulties, however, have resided in the ability to carry out any one of these chosen reactions to produce the desired compound at acceptable efficiency, conversion rate and selectivity. In almost all instances the reaction is generally catalyzed using Group VIII transition metal compound as catalyst and a halogen as the promoter. It is known that many other metal compounds and promoters can be used. In addition0 the prior art has disclosed the use of secondary activators or ligands in conjunction with the metal catalysts and promoters. These secondary activators can be other metallic salts or compounds, amines, phosphorus compounds, as well as a multitude of other compounds that have been disclosed in the published literature. Thus, a typical catalyst system contains the metal ator catalyst, promoter and, optionally, uganda, solvents and secondary activators.Though a significant anount of literature does exist describing the production of acetic acid by the isoserizationof methyl formate, to our knowledge it does not disclose or suggest our invention. Several of the pertinent patents in this area are discussed below. French Patent No. 2,317,269 discloses the production of aliphatic carboxylic acids by the reaction of an alcohol with carbon monoxide in the presence of a catalyst containing at least three essential components, iridium atom, copper atom and halogen. This is not our process. In European Patent Application No. 0018927 there is described a process for the production of aonocarborylic acids by the carbonylation of an alcohol using a nickel catalyst, a halide and a solvent in this reference synthesis gas is used. In the process of the invention of this instant application an organic acid is produced from a formate ester using a rhodium atom catalyst and lithium iodide in cosjusetion with methyl iodide. In European Patent Application No. 0045637. there is disclosed the direct conversion of formic acid esters to their corresponding carboxylic acid8 without the presence of carbon monoxide using as catalyst a soluble irridium salt and an iodine promoter. This is not our catalytic process. Another known procedure for producing acetic acid is the catalytic isomerization of methyl formate as shown by the reaction EMI3.1 This procedure is shown in U.S. 1,697,109. The process described is a vapor phase isomerization reaction carried out at 2000C to 450QC at a pressure up to 200 atmospheres using a metal pxide or acetate catalyst. It does not disclose the use of rhodium and lithium iodide plus methyl iodide. U.S. 2,508,513 claims an iron metal atom based catalyst, e.g. nickel, promoted with methyl iodide for the isomerization of methyl formate to acetic acid, carried out at 3000C to 4000C and a pressure up to 400 atmospheres.Carbon monoxide may be present. It does not disclose the use of rhodium and lithium iodide plus methyl iodide. U.S. 3,060,233 discloses the carbonylation of methanol to acetic acid using a metal of the iron group of the Periodic Table and a halide. It does not disclose use of rhodium or the use of a formate ester. U.S. 3,769,329 discloses the production of carboxylic acids from alcohols, or the ester, ether and halide derivatives thereof, and carbon monoxide using a rhodium catalyst and a halogen component. It does not mention mixtures of lithium iodide and methyl iodide. U,St 3,798,267 relates to the conversion of methyl formate to acetic acid in the presence of a catalyst system consisting essentially of activated carbon and a halogen promoter. The reference uses catalyst and starting materials different than those employed in the invention of this application. U.S. 4,194,056 discloses the production of carboxylic acid from methyl formate using a soluble rhodium catalyst, halogen promoter and carbon monoxide. This is not the process of the instant invention, nor does this reference suggest or disclose the use of a mixture of lithium iodide plus methyl iodide and the unexpected results achieved by its use. U.S. Patent No. 4,212,989 describes a process for producing carboxylic acids or their esters by reacting an alcohol or an ether with carbon monoxide using a Group VIII metal catalyst and an iodine promoter. The reference contains no suggestion or disclosure of the production of organic carboxylic acids from a formate ester. British Patent Specification 1,286,224 relates to the reaction of methyl formate with carbon monoxide in contact with a rhodium catalyst and a halogen promoter to produce acetic acid. It contains no recognition of the distinct advantages achieved with the use of lithium iodide plus methyl iodide. in fact it does not mention mixtures of these specific compounds. British Patent Specification 1,293,193 relates to the direct conversion of formic acid esters to the corresponding carboxylic acids, in the presence of carbon monoxide, a catalyst that is a Group IIb or VIII metal and an organic polar solvent. It does not disclose use of rhodium atom plus lithium iodide and methyl iodide. Japanese Patent Publication 50 167734 discloses the production of an organic acid from the corresponding formic acid ester in the presence of carbon monoxide using a catalyst system containing cobalt, iron or mercury and a halogen plus an alkali metal salt of a lower aliphatic carboxylic acid, triamine or cyclic amine. Japanese Patent Publication 51 65703, discloses the reaction of methyl formate in the presence of carbon monoxide using a system containing a rhenium catalyst and halogen compound to produce acetic acid. Japanese Patent Publication 56 22745 discloses the isomerization of a formic acid ester to the corresponding acid in the presence of carbon monoxide, palladium atom, halogen and base. Japanese Patent Application No. 56 73040 relates to a process for producing acetic acid by isomerizing methyl formats in the presence of carbon monoxide using a nickel catalyst, an iodine compound and an organic nitrogen compound. Japanese Patent Application 56 83439discloses a method for producing acetic acid by beating methyl formate and carbon monoxide in contact with a catalyst containing palladium, ruthenium and or irridium metal atom and a halide promoter. None of the five Japanese PatentApplications disclose a process for producing acetic acid from a formate ester posing a catalyst mixture consisting essentially of rhodium metal atom and lithium iodide plus methyl iodide. It can be seen that the prior art contains many disclosures dealing with the catalytic production of acetic acid, including its production by the isomerization of methyl formate. The art also discloses the production of other organic carboxylic acids by the isomerization of other formats esters. One of the disadvantages in many of these references is the presence of water with the eventual need to remove it from the desired organic acid product. This removal is both complicated and costly. Other disadvantages often include the simultaneous occurrence of other reactions leading to the formation of by products, such as, dimethyl acetal, methyl acetate, and ethanol. These reactions compete with the organic acid production resulting in low conversion rate and selectivity to organic acid. Many processes employed for the production of organic acids use a catalyst system containing a source of metal atom and a source of halide atom.The alkali metal halides are often mentioned as suitable halide sources. but no distinction is made between any specific one of the alkali metal halides or between any other halogen compound. Nor do any of the references suggest or recognize the synergistic advantage of the use of mixtures of lithium iodide and methyl iodide in conjunction with rhodium catalyst. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A catalyst system and process for the production of organic acids at high efficiency, selectivity and conversion rate by the reaction of organic esters of formic acid, such as methyl formate1 in the presence of carbon monoxide or of synthesis gas has been found. The catalyst system charged to the reactor in our process contains rhodium atoms. lithium iodide and methyl iodide and optionally an organic ligand. The use of mixtures of lithium iodide and methyl iodide in this system within the ranges defined results in a synergistic effect with unexpectedly high efficiency, high conversion rate or activity and high selectivity not heretofore achieved. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In the catalytic reactions of synthesis gas or carbon monoxide in processes to produce oxygenated organic compounds there are several criteria required of the catalyst. The catalyst must be as stable as possible, it should have a high activity or conversion rate, and it should have as high a selectivity for the desired product as possible. Stability of the catalyst relates to how long the catalyst remains functional before either breaking down or losing its catalytic effect. Activity or conversion rate relates to the amounts of reactants the catalyst converts to product per unit of time, generally expressed in g.mole per liter per hour g mole l hr Selectivity relates to the quantity of desired product produced, generally expressed in mole percent, based on the total amount of both desired products and undesired products produced. The goal to be achieved is high values for all three criteria and continued efforts are being made to find new catalyst compositions to reach this goal without having a significant detrimental effect on the overall process. Toward this goal the prior art has developed catalyst systems containing a wide variety of metal atoms, promoters and activators, in many cases with diverse other components added.Though these catalyst systems are effective, improvement is always desirable. The present invention is based on the unexpected and unpredictable discovery that the rhodium lithium iodide plus methyl iodide system is an unexpectedly superior catalytic system showing a synergistic effect for the production of organic acids from esters of formic acid hereinafter formates at unexpected high efficiency, selectivity and conversion rate. It was also found that a ligand, Ear 3, can also be present as an optional component of the system. This unexpected synergistic improvement in efficiency, selectivity and conversion rate is achieved when the rhodium catalyzed system s components are maintained within a defined range and when both lithium iodide plus methyl iodide are present as the source of the halogen component in the system. Optionally a solvent and or diluent can also be present.The improved catalyst system of this invention can be portrayed as containing the components Rh LiI CE3I ERt 3, wherein Rh is the rhodium containing compound and ER 3 is optionally present. In the process of our invention formates are reacted with carbon monoxide using a particular catalyst system containing rhodium atoms and both lithium iodide and methyl iodide. This system synergistically produces commercially desirable organic acids at unexpectedly high efficiency, conversion rate and selectivity, with a minimum of by products and without the presence of water. The overall reaction that occurs is theoretically EMI9.1 In the above formula R is a monovalent hydrocarbyl group.It can be an alkyl group having from 1 to 30 carbon atoms, preferably from 1 to 15 carbon atoms. and most preferably from 1 to 5 carbon atoms an alkenyl group having from 2 to 30 carbon atoms, preferably from 2 to 15 carbon atoms and most preferably from 2 to 5 carbon atoms or an aryl, aralkyl or alkaryl group having 6 or 10 ring carbon atoms, e.g., phenyl and naphthyl, with from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms, in the alk molety thereof. The R group can be linear or branched and it can be unsubstituted or substituted with groups which will not have an adverse effect on the reaction further the alkenyl groups can contain more than one unsaturated bond. Illustrative of suitable formate esters one can mention methyl formate, ethyl formate, the propyl formats, the butyl formates, the decyl formates, 2 ethylhexyl formate, stearyl formate, phenyl formate, benzyl formate, vinyl formate, allyl formate, naphthyl formate, tolyl formate. The rhodium component of the catalyst system can be supplied from any number of sources, many of these are known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Thus, it is not necessary for an understanding thereof to specifically enumerate every suitable type and every specific compound since any of the known rhodium compounds can be used. The essential rhodium component of the catalyst system of the present invention may be provided by introducing into the reaction zone a compound of rhodium or may be provided by introducing into the reaction zone rhodium. Among the materials which may be charged to the reaction zone to provide the rhodium component of the catalyst system of the present invention are rhodium metal, rhodium salts and oxides, organo rhodium compounds and coordination compounds of rhodium, Specific examples of materials capable of providing the rhodium constituent of the catalyst system of the present invention may be taken from the following list of suitable materials.RhC12RhBr3RhI2RhCl3 3H2ORhBr3 3H20 Rh2 CO 4C12 Rh2 CO 4Br2Rh2 CO 4I2 Rh2 CO 8 Rh C6H5 3P 2 CO I RhE C6H5 3P 2 CO Cl Rh metalRh N03 3RhCl C6H5 3P 2 CH3I 2Rh SnCl3 C6H5 3P 2RhCl CO C6H5 3As 2RhI CO C6H5 3Sb 2 n C4H9 4N Rh CO 2X2 where X Cl , Br , I n C4H9 4AS 2 Rh CO 2Y4 where X br , I n C4H9 4P Rh CO I4 Rh C6H5 3P 2 CO BrRh n C4H9 3P 2 CO BrRh n C4H9 3P 2 CO IRhBr C6H5 3O 3RhI C6H5 3P 3RhCl C6H5 3P 2 BhCll C6B5 3P 3B2 C6H5 3P 3Rh CO H Rh2O3 Rh C3H4 2Cl 2 K4Rh2Cl2 SnCl2 4 X4Rh2Br2 SnBr3 4 K4Rh2 I 2 5n12 4 In addition, one can use the other Group VIII transition metals comprising the iron triad, i.e., iron, ruthenium, osmium the cobalt triad, i.e., cobalt, rhodium, iridium or the nickel triad1 i.e.. nickel, palladium, platinum. Though these will catalyze the reaction. the preferred metals are nickel and rhodium. with the most preferred being rhodium. The rhodium or Group VIII metal atom concentration can vary over a wide range. Enough metal atom must be present to achieve reasonable reaction rates however, an excess may on occasion result in undesired by products formation. For simplicity, the rhodium atom will be used in the specification with the understanding that it also applies to the other transition metals of Group VIII. The mole ratio of rhodium to formate can vary from 1 25 to 1 40,000, the preferred range is from 1 40 to 1 5,000, with the most preferred range being from 1 100 to 1 2,000. The amount used is not a critical feature in this invention and higher rhodium concentrations are acceptable but are influenced by economic considerations. The second component of the catalyst system is lithium iodide. It can be charged directly, or it can be formed in situ by any combination of lithium compound and iodine component that will result in the formation of lithium iodide during the reaction. Lithium bromide can also be used but the iodide is preferred. The presence of lithium iodide or lithium bromide in conjunction with methyl iodide is a critical feature of this invention. Direct charge of lithium iodide is the preferred form.However, any convenient combination of compounds for in situ formation of lithium iodide can be used.This includes the use of lithium carboxylates, carbonates and the like with a halogen compound such as iodine or an alkyl halide. A suitable combination for in situ formation is lithium carboxylate and an alkyl halide. The third essential component of the system is methyl iodide, which can be added directly ori formed in situ by the use of hydrogen iodide, which reacts to produce methyl iodide. The Rh CH I mole 3 ratio can vary from 1 1 to 1 1,000, preferably from 1 2 to 1 450. and most preferably from 1 8to 1 150. Sufficient lithium iodide and methyl iodide must be present to exert a promoting effect on the reaction and to result in high efficiency, conversion rate and selectivity to the corresponding organic acid. The mole ratio of Rh LiI can vary over a wide range. A Rh LiI mole ratio of from 1 1 to 1 1000 can be employed, the preferred range is from 1 2 to 1 450 and most preferably it is from 1 8 to 1 150. The mole ratio of Lil to CH3 I can vary from 1 1,000 to 1,000 1, preferably from 1 450 to 450 1, and most preferably from 1 150 to 150 1. As indicated, an organic ligand of the general formula ER3 can optionally be present in the reaction system. The use of such ligands is known, as are their identities, to those skilled in this art. In this formula E represents a Group VA element, e.g., N, P, As, Sb and Bi, and R represents an organic moiety. The ligand can serve as a catalyst stabilizer and or to further enhance efficiency, conversion rate and selectivity, especially when the reaction is carried out at higher temperatures, for example at about 2000C or above. The ligand also serves to inhibit equipment corrosion in some instances. Bowever, the use of a ligand is not mandatory and the reaction can be carried out without it. A large number of organic ligands is known and any of these can be used provided they do not have an adverse effect on the reaction. Among those of particular utility are the tertiary gamines and the tri and pentavalent phosphorus compounds.Though those skilled in the art know these compounds, illustrative of suitable compounds one can mention triethylphosphine, tributyiphosphine, tri 2 ethylhexylphosphine, triphenylphosphine, tri 4 methoxyphenyl phosphine, tr i p tolylphosphine, tri 3 chlorophenyl phosphine, diphenyl hexylphosphine, dimethyl 3 methoxyphenyl phosphine, dibutyl stearylphosphine, tribenzylphosphine, dipropyl phenylphosphine. ethyl dipropyiphosphine, tricyclohexyiphosphine, cyclohexyl dibutylphosphine, propyl diphenylphosphine, dipropyl phenylphosphine, phenyl diethylphosphine, tridecylphosphine, trioctadecylphosphine, tribenzylphosphine, methyl diethyiphosphine, ethyl diphenylphosphine, tolyl diethylphosphine. cyclohexyl diethyiphosphine, diethyl cyclohexylphosphine, bis diphenylphosphino ethane. bis diethylphosphino propane. bis di phenylphosphino butane, bis diethylphosphino octane, trimethylamine, triethylamine, tri n butylamine, tri t butylamine, tri 2 ethylhexylamine, methyl dibutylamine, tridodecylamine. tristearylamine, ethyl dibutylamine, tricyclohexylamine, triphenylamine, tri 4 methoxyphenyl amine, tri p chlorophenyl amine, dibutyl phenylamine, dipentyl cyclopentylamine, ethyl diphenylamine, trinaphthylamine, tri p tolylamine, tri benzylamine, tri 3 methylcyclohexyl amine, and the arsines, stibines and bismuthines corresponding to the above identified phosphines and amines. . They can be used singly or, if one desires, mixtures containing or more ligands can be used. One can also employ a phosphine oxide or phosphite corresponding to the above phosphines as the ligand these are also well known. The concentration of ligand charged can vary from a molar ratio of ligand to rhodium of from 50 1 to 1 50, preferably from 10 1 to 1 10, most preferably 3 1 to 1 1. In addition to the ligand one can optionally have a solvent present. Many essentially inert solvents are known as useful. essentially inert. diluents and illustrative thereof one can mention 1,4 dioxane, the polyethylene glycols di ethers or esters, diphenyl ether. sulfolane, toluene, carboxylic acids as well as any other diluent or solvent which does not interfere with the reaction to any aignificant extent. The reaction is preferably carried out in the absence of any solvent or diluent other than those required to introduce reactants or catalyst components. The reaction is carried out at a temperature of from 500C to 3500C, preferably from 1200C to 2200C and most preferably.from 1400C to 2000C. When the reaction is carried out at temperatures above 2000C in the presence of anER 3 ligand, the phosphines are the preferred uganda. The pressure of the reaction can be from 10.35 13.8 to 69 bar to 690 bar 150 psig to 10,000 psig , preferably from 200 psig to psig to 1,000 psig , most preferably from 200 psig to 500 psig 13,8 to 34,5 bar. The reaction time varies depending upon the reaction parameters, reactor size and charge, and the individual components employed at the specific process conditions. The reaction can be a batch or continuous reaction. The synergistic effect of mixtures of lithium iodide and methyl iodide on conversion rate was completely unexpected and unpredictable.Significant rate increases were obtained as compared to the use of rhodium vith lithium iodide alone or rhodium with methyl iodide alone. The significantly enhanced reaction rates in the production of organic acids from formate esters are very advantageous in that they result in increased productivity from an available reactor, or they would allov for a significant reduction in size for a new reactor.Another advantage is that equivalent productivity can be achieved with the use of much less of the expensive rhodium catalyst, Use of the system of this invention results in production of acetic acid from methyl formate at typical conversion rates of from 10 to 50 gmoles 1 h and typical selectivities 27,6 bar of from 90 to 99 at 180 C and 400 psig CO pressure. The values obtained exceed those obtained when eitber methyl iodide or lithium iodide were used individually with rhodium. The experiments and examples detailed below were carried out in a Hasteloy9 steel autoclave reactor having a volume of 300 ml, which was equipped with temperature and pressure sensing means, heating and cooling means, agitator and inlet and outlet means for introducing and removing components from the reactor. The autoclaves used in synthesis gas reactions are well known in the art and can be used in this process. Prior to charging the reactants the autoclave was washed with methanol at 100 C under a 34,5 to 69 bar nitrogen gas pressure of 500 to 1.000 psig by agitating for 30 minutes. The autoclave was drained, rinsed with dry acetone, and dried with.nitrogen. The liquid components were charged to the cleaned autoclave first and then the solid components were added and stirred. The autoclave was closed and purged with carbon monoxide and then pressurized to the desired pressure with carbon monoxide. The autoclave contents were heated to the selected temperature, with agitation usually 750 rp, in about 45 minutes. After the desired temperature was reached, the reaction was allowed to consume gas for the tise period indicated.During this time the pressure was maintained by addition of carbon monoxide as needed At the end of the reactor run, the contents were cooled, generally to about lOeC. A vapor phase sample was taken for gas chromatography analysis the gas phase was vented through 2 dry ice acetone traps and then through a 10 liter saturated solution of calcium hypochlorite to remove metal carbonyls.if formed. The reactor was pressurized three times , . . 6 .2 bar witn nitrogen, o psig and vented through the same system. The residual reactor contents were dumped into a chilled pressure bottle and sealed.Subsequent analysis was performed using aHewlett Packard Model 5880 gas chromatograph 3,2 mm 3 m equipped with a one eighth inch diameter by ten feet long column packed with Chromosorb 101. The following examples serve to further illustrate this invention. In the examples the term AcAc means wacetylacetonate . Values given for acetic acid obtained include acetic acid equivalents present as methyl acetate. Control ExPeriment A In this experiment the system contained rhodium atom and lithium iodide only. The autoclave was charged with 1.03 g ofRh C0 2 AcAc 4 mmoles , 4.28 g of lithium iodide 32 mmoles and 146 g of methyl formate 2.45 moles . Following the procedure described above the reaction was carried out at 180 C and a carbon 27.6 bar monoxide pressure of 400 psig for 3 hours. The major product was 1.28 moles of acetic acid. The calculated rate to acetic acid was 2.8 gmole l.h. and the conversion of methyl formate to acetic acid was 70 . Control ExPeriments Series B A series of experiments was carried out using the same procedures and conditions employed inControl Experiment A. In this series the concentrations of rhodium, lithium iodide or methyl iodide were varied in all instances 146g of methyl format. were charged.

The procedure followed was the same as described in Control Experiment A but due to the increased reaction rate the reaction was run for only one hour. The major product was 0.47 mole of acetic acid. The calculated rate to acetic acid was 3.1 gmole 1 h and the conversion of methyl formate to acetic acid was 26 . Comparison to run C of ControlExperiments Series B shows the unpredictable and unexpected increase in rate resulting from the addition of methyl iodide to the reaction a six fold increase, accompanied by a 18 increase in conversion Example 2 A series of runs was carried out using the same conditions described in Example 1 but varying the concentrations of rhodium, lithium iodide and methyl iodide. The unexpected and unpredictable increases in rate and conversion are obvious upon comparison with the results achieved in the ControlExperiments, particular attention should be made to the results of Run i with the results of Control Experiment A.

This was surprising since Run d ofControl Experiments Series B, which used 32 mmoles of CH3I with Rh failed to achieve any reaction to acetic acid. In Run e 120 mmoles of CH3 I were required to effect the rate achieved by 64 moles in ZRun b at 1 4 the rhodium catalyst charged. The control experiments appeared to indicate that CH3 I was a poor promoter. Thus, it was unpredictable and unexpected to discover the synergism between lithium iodide and methyl iodide with the rhodium catalyst.
