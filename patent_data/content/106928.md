## Description
DESCRIPTION Field of the Invention The present invention relates generally to a toy made up of compound curved surfaces and more specifically to an irregularly bounding elastic toy ball made up of a plurality of curved surfaces which is especially suitable for little children. Description of the Prior Art The background of the present invention will be explained with respect to its application to a toy ball usually used for little children. As is well known, there are various spherical or oval Rugby toy balls with which little children can play.These toy balls are usually made of foamed plastic resin or by blowing air into a spherical capsule made of polyvinyl chloride, so as not to bound excessively from the standpoint of safety. However, in the case when a little child who can only walk on hands and legs plays with a prior art toy ball, since his hand is small and additionally the ball is spherical or oval in shape, there exist some shortcomings as follows 1 When a little child catches the ball by one hand or both hands and then holds it on his breast, the ball easily bounds out of his hands or his breast, dropping onto the ground. 2 Especially when he tries to throw the ball, he must first raise his hands by which the ball is caught before throwing it. However, since he cannot hold the ball securely, he tends to drop it soon. 3 The ball easily rolls on to a far distance and therefore he losts sight of the ball. As a result, he losts his interest in playing with the ball. 4 Since the rotating motion of the ball is simple, he gets soon tired of playing with the ball.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION With these problems in mind, therefore, it is the primary object of the present invention to provide an elastic toy ball of a peculiar shape having the following advantages 1 Since the toy ball is made up of a plurality of concave curved surfaces, a little child can easily catch it by one hand or hold it on his breast securely. 2 Since the shape is not simply spherical or oval and therefore the ball does not roll on to a far distance, a little child can pick up it soon without losting sight of the ball. 3 Since the toy ball rotates or bounds in various directions at random, the rotating motion of the ball is interesting to a little child. 4 When the elasticity and the size of the ball are appropriately designed, the toy ball can also be used when a grown up person or an old person takes exercise or when a physically handicapped person is rehabilitated. 5 When a plurality of toy balls are piled up one after another, it is possible to use these balls as building blocks. To achieve the above mentioned object, the elastic toy ball of compound curved surfaces according to the present invention has a peculiar shape the contour of which comprises at least four convex spherical surfaces defined as the portions of the surfaces of at least four spheres, the centers of which are disposed at points around a center of the toy ball, and a plurality of concave curved surfaces connecting the at least four convex spherical surfaces.In the most standard shape, the contour of the elastic toy ball of compound curved surfaces comprises four convex spherical surfaces defined as the portions of the surfaces of four first spheres of equal radius, the centers of which define a regular tetrahedron, and a plurality of concave spherical surfaces connecting the four convex spherical surfaces and defined by trace of the portion of the surface of a second sphere, the radius of which is twice or more greater than that of the first sphere, between points tangent to the first spheres, when the second sphere is rotated about the first spheres while remaining tangent to at least any two of the four first spheres.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS In view of the above description, reference is now made to a first embodiment of an elastic toy ball made up of a plurality of curved surfaces according to the present invention.

The centers of the four small spheres define a regular tetrahedron. The four concave spherical portions are defined, respectively, when one of the four large spheres is tangent to three of the four small spheres. The six saddle portions are defined by the trace of the portion of the surface of the large sphere, between points tangent to the small spheres, when the large sphere is rotated about the small spheres while remaining tangent to two of the small spheres. Further, the elastic toy ball according to the present invention is made of foamed plastic such as foamed urethane. The shape of the elastic toy ball shown inFig. 1 A is described in more detail hereinbelow. Fig. 1 B shows a regular tetrahedron 100, the apexes of which are labeled Oir 02 and 03.
