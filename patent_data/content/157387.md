# Signal transducing head moving apparatus.

## Abstract
A signal transducing head moving apparatus using a stepping motor which comprises a reversible stepping mo tor 20 for moving a head and a motor drive control means 30, 40 for driving the stepping motor 20 in alternate for ward and reverse directions through switching of excitation phases of the motor 20 after the motor 20 has been driv en in one direction, thereby eliminating errors of the step position of the stepping motor 20 due to a hysteresis char acteristic thereof. The head thus can be stopped at the same position irrespective of whether it is accessed in the forward or reverse direction.
