# SPECIFIC BINDING ASSAYS UTILIZING ANALYTE CYTOLYSIN CONJUGATES

## Abstract
A novel analyte cytolysin conjugate and its use in a lipid vesicle mediated measurement process is described for a wide variety of analytes present at very low concentration. The method involves forming a reaction system consisting of analyte, analyte specific binding agent, analyte cytolysin conjugate, and vesicles containing detectable marker mate rial in such proportions that uncombined conjugate alters the permeability of the vesicles resulting in the release and quantitative detection of marker material which can be correlated with the amount of analyte initially present.
