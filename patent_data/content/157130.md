# A method and an arrangement for the manufacture of packing containers.

## Abstract
In the manufacture of packing containers of the type containing a liquid product with a certain portion of solid particles e.g. soup with pieces of fruit it is difficult to fill the packing containers 14 in such a manner that the desired proportions of liquid and solid contents are safeguarded. This is the case in particular in modern, fast working pack ing machines, since the filling time is short and a rapid filling, moreover, increases the risk of contents ending up in undesirable places and rendering difficult the sealing of the packing container. In accordance with the invention which relates to a method as well as to an arrangement for the manufacture of packing containers, this is solved by feeding the solid and liquid parts separately via two filling pipes 10, 11 , the feeding of the liquid contents being ended only after the feeding of solid particles has been ended.
