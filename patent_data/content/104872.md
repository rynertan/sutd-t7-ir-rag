## Description
Air conditioning and compressor control system This invention is related to gas compressors e.g. gas compressors driven by independently variable speed prime movers and used in air conditioning systems of the type wherein the compressor receives a working gas through an intake and compresses the working gas, which gas is then passed from a compressor discharge through a condensor and then through an evaporator, and wherein air is drawn in from an area and passed over the evaporator to be cooled and then returned to the said area. The invention is more particularly directed to a control system for controlling the operation of such compressors and related air conditioning heating functions.Still more particularly, the present invention is directed to a system for controlling a variable load compressor of the wellknown type operable at a first capacity level in response to a first control signal for providing a first degree of compression to the working gas and at a second capacity level in response to a second control signal for providing a second greater degree of compression to the working gas. An improved compressor of this type is disclosed in U.S. patent no 4,380,048 and leads to a more efficient and economical variable capacity air conditioning system. As described in this specification, the compressor capacity is adjusted by the operation of a pair of solenoid valves, the compressor operating at minimum, e.g. 33 percent, load when neither of the solenoid valves is energized, intermediate load, e.g.66 percent load, when one of the solenoid valves is energized and maximum, or 100 percent load when the other solenoid valve is energized. In order for the air conditioning system to operate efficiently, there remains a need for a control system for determining the conditions under which the solenoid Valves should be actuated. Such a control system mould preferably not only control the load conditions as the compressor but should also comprise an integrated system for controlling various other air conditioning heating system functions. The control system should not only be as simple as possible to minimize manufacturing costs and maximize reliability, but should also be sufficiently sophisticated to maintain the system operation at its maximum efficiency. According to the present invention, a control system for a compressor of the type just described, for use in an air conditioning system of the type referred to earlier, comprises temperature sensing means for sensing the temperature of the returned air, the temperature sensing means providing a first temperature signal when the return air temperature is above a first temperature level to cause the compressor to operate at the first capacity level and a second temperature signal when the return air temperature is above a second temperature level to cause the compressor to operate at the second capacity level, and control means for providing the first and second control signals in response to the first and second temperature signals. Expressed in more general terms, such a control system includes a plurality of temperature sensors for sensing temperatures at various points within the air conditioning system, a plurality of switches for detecting both ambient and system internal conditions, and logic circuitry for logically combining outputs from the sensors and switches and providing in response thereto the appropriate output signals for system control. Although the temperatures may be sensed in an analog manner, the analog temperature signals in the preferred embodiment are subjected to a plurality of threshold comparisons to provide the proper signal format for logic operations.In the preferred embodiment, the logic circuitry will provide a STEP 1 output permitting low load operation in response to a first set of conditions, will provide a STEP 2 signal permitting intermediate load operation in response to a second set of conditions inclusive of the first set of conditions and will provide a STEP 3 signal permitting full load operation in response to a third set of conditions inclusive of the second set of conditions. In addition to these various load controlling signals, the control system will indicate to the system operator whether a malfunction has occurred.The system will also indicate to the operator when the conditions for operation have not been satisfied but the air conditioning system has been turned on.Provision is made for control of liquid injection to cool the compressor, inhibition of compressor loading beyond the first capacity level until proper suction pressure is achieved during start up or if discharge pressure exceeds a high set point, reheating of return air after it has been dehumidified by cooling and heating of return air when a heating mode of operation is selected. The invention will be more clearly understood from the following description in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a brief block diagram of the overall control system Figure 2 is a timing diagram illustrating the operation of a coil temperature signal Figure 3 is a timing diagram. illustrating the operation of a discharge temperature signal Figure 4 is a brief schematic diagram of low and high pressure switches employed tn Figure 1 and Figure 5 is a diagram of a preferred embodiment of logic circuitry of Figure 1. As illustrated in Figure 1, the system includes a plurality of input devices 10 26 for providing signals indicative of return air, ambient and system parameters, a control block 30 for receiving input signals from the various devices 10 26 and a plurality of output devices 42 54 for receiving control signals from the control block 30 in response to particular combinations of input signals. The individual components illustrated in Figure 1 may be described as follows The return air temperature sensor ILLS 10 will comprise a temperature sensor and an operational amplifier based circuit for producing a voltage linearly proportional to the return air temperature over the range of approximately 180C to 27to. In the context of an air conditioning system for, e.g. a street bus, the return air is the air within the bus as opposed to the ambient air outside the bus.The temperature sensor portion of the RTS 10 may preferably comprise a thermistor of a type well known in the art and available, e.g. from Keystone Carbon, and the maximum error of the RTS output should be approximately 0. 30 C. The thermistor should be iinearized, i.e. it should provide a signal linearly proportional to temperature change over the temperature range of interest. The return air temperature proportional voltage will be applied to three non inverting comparator circuits included either within the RTS 10 or within the control block 30, The comparator circuits are each provided with a hysteresis characteristic in a well known manner.From these three non inverting comparator circuits will thus be provided three binary type return air temperature signals each representing a different temperature level. By way of example, the three binary type return air temperature signals, designated RAA, RAB and RAC respectively, may have the nominal set points and hysteresis characteristics set forth below inTABLE 1 TABLE 1Signal label Nominal On Adjustment Hysteresis Set point Range RAA 220 C 0.5 C 20 C RAB 230 C 0.50 c 0.50C RAC 24 C 0.5 C 0.5 C In addition to the adjustment range for each set point as shown in TABLE 1, an additional control will be included to permit all three signals as a group to be adjusted 30 C from the nominal on set points. The evaporator coil temperature sensor CTS 12 preferably comprises an affixed sensor at a desired location in the evaporator coil to monitor the coil temperature, and an operational amplifierbased circuit to produce a voltage linearly proportional to the coil temperature over the range of approximately 10C to 20C. The sensor portion of the CTS12 is preferably a linearized thermistor and the maximum amplifier circuit should be 0.3 C C as in the RTS 10. As is the case with the RTS 10, the coil temperature proportional voltage in the CTS 12 will be applied to a quantizing circuit made up ot three non inverting comparator circuits with hysteresis to produce three binary type coil temperature signals each representing a different temperature threshold.The nominal set points for the three binary signals may be as defined in the following TABLE 2 TABLE 2Signal label Nominal On Adjustment Hysteresis Set point Range CTD oOC 20C 0.50 C CTE 10 C 2 C 0.50C CTF 20 C 20C 0.50 C Also included in the CTS 12, or alternatively in the control block 30, is suitable delay circuitry of the type well known in the art for delaying the CTD on going and off going transitions.In the preferred embodiment, the on going transition may be delayed by approximately one minute while the off going transition is delayed by approximately five minutes, as illustrated in Figure 2. In Figure 2, the delayed version of the CTD signal is labelled CTflD. The delay is provided in the on going transition on the assumption that the evaporator coil may be permitted to operate at a temperature of at or slightly below 0 C for a short period of time before it will freeze up. The delay in the offgoing transition is provided to ensure that. the evaporator coil temperature will be permitted to rise adequately above OOC. The on going and offgoing delays will together prevent the compressor from cycling on and off too quickly due to rapid fluctuations in the evaporator coil temperature. The discharge line temperature sensor DTS 14 preferably comprises a temperature sensor attached to the compressor discharge line at a location upstream of the system condenser. The basis temperature signal from this sensor will then be amplified to produce a signal proportional to the discharge temperature over the range of approximately 790C to 1150 C. The maximum error of this temperature proportional voltage within theDTS 14 should be approximately 30 C Either internally of the DTS 14 or within the control block 30 itself, the discharge line temperature proportional voltage is applied to two non inverting comparator circuits with hysteresis to produce two binary type discharge line signals each representing a different temperature threshold.The nominal set points in the preferred embodiment may be as shown below in TABLE 3 TABLE 3Signal Nominal On Adjustment Hysteresis FunctionLabel Set point RangeDTS1 900 C 80 C 50C ControlDTS2 1150 C 130 C 110 C SafetyThe two discharge temperature signals, labelled asDTS 1 and DTS 2 are designated as being relevant to control and safety functions, respectively, and this distinction will be discussed in more detail below.In addition to the data shown in TABLE 3, it is preferable to delay only the DTS 2 on going transition while providing no delay in the off going traiisition. In the preferred embodiment, the on going transition is delayed for three minutes, and the delayed DTS 2 signal is labelled in figure 3 as DTS 2D. The ongoing delay is provided under the assumption that the compressor can operate without harm for a short period of time at a discharge temperature in excess of 1150 C. The remaining input devices 16 26 provide only a single binary type output to be received as an input by the control block 30, as distinguished from the signals provided by the devices 10 14 which are either analog or multiple bit depending upon the location of the multiple level comparator circuits. The RelativeHumidity Switch RHS comprises a switch which will close when the relative humidity in the return air stream exceeds a maximum predetermined comfort level.The RHS set point may be, for example, 65 i5 . The Low suction Pressure Switch LPS 18 will monitor the compressor suction pressure and provide an output indicating a fault, or low pressure, condition.Although a number of alternative connection arrangements could be used, one example would be a two wire connection from the control block 30 to the LPS 18 with one wire carrying logic power supply voltage to the switch 18. Under normal operating conditions, the power supply to the switch 18 would pass through a normally closed switch and thence back to the control block where it would be inverted to indicate a logic zero signifying a non fault condition. If a fault occurs to open the switch 18, or if the connection wire between the switch 18 and control panel 30 is broken, the voltage on the return wire to the control panel would be lost and, after inversion, a logic one would indicate a fault condition.The second wire carrying the logic supply voltage back to the control panel 30 is connected through an appropriate resistor to ground and also to the input of a logic inverter. This type of connection is briefly illustrated in the schematic diagram of figure 4 wherein the return wire 60 from the LPS 18 is connected through a resistor 62 to ground and also to the input of the inverter 64. If a malfunction occurs which does not cause the LPS 18 to open, for example if the insulation on a wire is chafed through to form a path to ground, a fuse or circuit breaker 33 connected in series with the logic power supply will open to remove power from the LPS 18 and shut down the system. The lower set point high discharge pressure switch HPS 1 in series with the pull down pressure switch PDPS together form the not torque limit signal tes 20 and functions in a manner similar toLPS 18 in that it is coupled to the control panel via two wires one of which carries logic power supply voltage to the series combination and the other of which carries the power supply voltage back to the control panel 66. At the time of compressor start up, the pull down pressure switch, PDPS, which is monitoring the suction side of the compressor, serves to limit the compressor capacity to the first step until the suction pressure is pulled down to the switch set point.During routine compressor operation when the discharge pressure reaches the set point of BPS 1, the switch opens and interrupts the logic voltage back to the control panel thereby signifying a high discharge pressure condition and allowing the compressor to operate only in the first step capacity. The higher set point High discharge PressureSwitch HPS 2 22 is a second high discharge pressure switch similar to HPS 1 but with a set point above that of HPS l. In the preferred embddiment, as shown in figure 4, the BPS 2 return line 68 is coupled through a resistor 70 to ground and also to the input of an inverting amplifier 72, so that a high level output from inverter 72 will indicate a fault condition. Ambient Temperature Switch ATS 24 may include any one of variety of well known temperature sensors to indicate when the ambient temperature is above a preset value, under which circumstances the ATS 24 output signal will be a logic 1. The switch in the preferred embodiment may close and open at approximately 90 C and 70 C respectively, to provide a 30C hysteresis characteristic. The last of the illustrated input devices is an A C heat mode selector switch 26. This switch is preferably located in the vicinity of the operator s instrument panel and permits the system operator to manually turn the system on and off. Turning now to the output devices1 the Refrigeration On lst Step unit 42 may be a relay which controls the energization of any system components necessary for compressor operation. When a signal on line 43 occurs as an indication from the control block 30 that refrigeration is allowed and compressor operation is desired, a control relay device 42 will be energized which in turn will accomplish energization of the various functions required for system operation, e.g. fan motors, compressor clutch, damper closure, etc. The 2nd Step device 44 and third step device 46 would be relays for enabling the intermediate load and full load compressor operations, respectively. The relays are necessary since the output signals from the control logic circuitry will usually not be capable of providing sufficient current to activate the necessary components. These devices operated by relays 44 and 46 in figure 1 may, for instance, correspond to solenoid valves 106 and 108, respectively, in the system disclosed in copending application 242,100.Thus, a signal on line 43 will result in low load system operation, signals on both of wines 43 and 45 will result in intermediate load operation, and signals on both of lines 43 and 47 will result in full load operation. Liquid Injection device 48 is provided for oil cooling for the screw compressor. When required for oil cooling purposes, a solenoid valve included within the injection device 48 will be energized to either inject liquid into the compressor or by pass oil through an air cooled surface. The Heat Relay 50 is provided to control hot water flow through heating coils in the return air flow path when return air temperature is too low.Heating of return air may be necessary during normal heating mode operation when the ambient air temperature is low or during air conditioning mode operation after air has been dehumidified by cooling. When reheating is called for after dehumidification, the effective amount of heat added is reduced from that amount provided during normal heat mode operation by pulsing the heat relay on and off Thereby causing only a fraction of the normal full time heat to be applied. The malfunction light 52 may preferably be located on the operators console or in the vicinity thereof to indicate to the operator that the air conditioning system is inoperative and that a manual reset is required before the system can again be rendered operational. This manual reset may be performed internally of the control block 30 so that it will only be accessible to a qualified serviceman or technician. The final output device illustrated in figure 1 is the Operation Not Allowed device which preferably comprises a light at the operators console to be energized to indicate to the operator that the air conditioning system will not be allowed to function due to low ambient temperature. This light should only be energized when a malfunction is not present and system operation has been requested as detected by the A C mode signal from switch 26. The operation of the system will now be described with reference to the logic diagram of figure 5 which illustrates control logic circuitry included within the control block 30 in figure 1. When the operator desires to utilize the air conditioning system, theA C heat mode switch is placed in the A C mode position which raises the A C mode signal at gates 100 and 102. Assuming that the ambient temperature is sufficiently high, the ATS signal at the input of AND gate 102 will be high, while The inverted ATS signal at the input of gate 100 will disable the gate 100.Assuming that the suction and discharge pressures and the discharge temperature of the compressor are proper, and assuming that the ambient temperature and evaporator coil temperature are sufficiently high and that either the return air temperature or relative humidity are also high, all inputs to gate 102 will be at a high level and gate 102 will provide at its output on line 43 a signal which will be used to activate a refrigeration relay to turn on the compressor. If we assume that the return air temperature is between the nominal on set points for the return air temperature signals RAA and RAB from TABLE 1, the compressor will operate in its normal fashion to decrease the return air temperature. When the return air temperature eventually falls below the off temperature of signal RAA, e.g.20PC with a 20C hysteresis, the signal RAA will fall to a low level at the inputs to gate 104 and inverter 106. If the relative humidity is low, the RBS signal at the input to gate 108 will be low to that the outputs of gates 104, 108, 112 and 102 will all be low thus turning off the compressor. The compressor will automatically turn on again when the return air temperature rises above the on set point of RAA to Thereby enable gates 104, 112 and 102. If the return air temperature remains low, but the relative humidity exceeds its predetermined comfortable level, the signal RES will go to a high level to enable gates 108, 112 and 102, thereby turning on the compressor with the signal on line 43.The combination of low return air temperature through gate 106 and a compressor operation signal pulsed for 10 seconds on and 20 seconds off through gate 138 will cause the output of gate 110 to pulse the heat relay signal thus providing surges of hot water to a heating coil in the return air path. This will permit dehumidification of the return air without reducing the temperature thereof. When the relative humidity drops to a comfortable level, the RI S signal will become low to thereby turn off both the compressor and the heat relay. If during the compressor operation the return air temperature continues to rise because the compressor is not operating at a sufficient capacity, or if the return air temperature is already at a sufficiently high level when the A C mode signal is provided, return air signal RAB may be activated. Under this condition, the gates 104, 112 and 102 will continue to provide high output levels.If the evaporator coil temperature is higher than the intermediate temperature set point, the CTE signal will be high and will act together with the high level RAB signal to activate gate 114 which will then provide a signal through OR gate 116 to an input of AND gate 118. Assuming that the compressor discharge pressure does not exceed the set point of HPS 1 vnd that the suction is pulled down below the set point Of PDPS, TLS will be at a high level and assuming that the compressor has been operating refrigeration relay signal has been true for at least one minute, all three inputs to AND gate 118 will be high and a signal on line 45 will cause the compressor to operate at its intermediate load capacity. If the temperature continues to rise so that it exceeds the on set point of return air temperature signal RAC and the evaporator coil temperature is above set point CTF, gate 120 will be enabled to pass a signal through gate 122 to an input of AND gate 124.The compressor will then be energized to operate at its full load capacity. It should be noted that a condition of excessive humidity will cause the compressor to increase its capacity by one step. For example, if the return air temperature is sufficiently low such that RAA is at a low level but the evaporator coil temperature is sufficiently high such that CTDD is at a high level and the relative humidity is above the humidity sensor set point such that RHS is high, then a logic 1 will be passed through AND gate 108 and OR gate 112 and will be applied to AND gate 102. Therefore, the compressor would be energized if the other inputs toAND gate 102 were at a logic 1 level. Also, note that the heat relay would be pulsed through OR gate 138 andAND gate 110 as long as the return air temperature remained below the RAA set point.On the other hand, if the temperature is above the set point of RAA such that the compressor must be operated at its low load condition in order to reduce the temperature, an excessive humidity in combination with this excessive temperature will call for a higher compressor capacity, and consequently a signal will be supplied through gates 126 and 116 to enable the AND gate 118 for intermediate load operation one minute after comprec sor operation was initiated by activtion of the refrigeration relay signal. Further if the temperature signal RAB is already callinq for intermediate load operation, an excessive humidity signal will be provided through gates 128 and 122 to enable gate 124 for full load operation.If either the temperature or humidity fall, the compressor will be reduced to an intermediate or low load condition as appropriate. The system capacity can be automatically tailored to the load requirements in the manner described above, but care must be taken to ensure that the evaporator coil does not freeze up. Accordingly, the capacity of the compressor can only be increased within the limits permitted by the evaporator coil temperature. For instance, if the evaporator coil temperature falls below the third CTS off threshold e.g. i C C in the example given in TABLE 2 , the signal CTF will fall to a low level and the full load condition will not be called for by the gate 120 even if the return air temperature exceeds the RAC set point. In such a case, full load operation is only possible if the relative humidity is also high as indicated by the output from gate 128.Similarly, if the intermediate evaporator coil temperature is not met, full load operation will not be permitted under any circumstances and intermediate load operation will only be permitted under circumstances of high relative humidity. If the evaporator coil temperature drops below the off threshold of the lowest coil temperature signal CTD, the system will be given a 5 minute grace period due to the turn off delay provided in the signal CTDD. If the coil temperature remains excessively low, the compressor will then be turned off due to the simultaneous disabling of both of gates 104 and 108. With the compressor off, the coil temperature will begin to rise until it exceeds theCTD on set point, and an additional 1 minute of grace period will be provided by the delay in the turn on ofCTDD as illustrated in figure 2. If at any time during the compressor operation the discharge pressure of the compressor exceeds a first predetermined value, the HPS l switch will open causing signal TLS to fall to a low level. This will reduce the capacity of the compressor to minimum load if it is already operating at either intermediate or full load. If the compressor is already operating at minimum load, no change in the system operation will occur. Also, during the normal compressor start up sequence, intermediate and full load operation is prevented until the suction pressure is pulled down below the set point of the pull down pressure switch PDPS thus closing the series circuit of PDPS and HPS l and making the TLS signal true. If the DTS sensor upstream of the system condenser detects that the working gas discharge temperature of the compressor exceeds a first predetermined value, the signal DTS 1 acting through gate 140 will provide a signal on line 49 whereby either liquid is injected into the compressor or oil is by passed through an air cooled surface to help cool down the compressor.This liquid injection will be terminated when the signal DTS 1 indicates that it is no longer called for. The operation described above thus far concerns the various control functions performed whereby the operation of the system is adjusted to meet various demands. However, the system is also provided with safety features for preventing or terminating compressor operation under certain circumstances. Under normal operation, the latching relay 130 provides a logic 1 output which is provided as an input to each of gates 100 and 102. Under these conditions, the system will operate as described above and the operate tion not allowed light will only be energized by the gate 100 if the A C mode input is active and theATS signal to the input of inverter 132 falls to a low level to indicate that the ambient temperature is too low to permit compressor operation.If any one of a number of hazardous conditions occur, however, the relay 130 will latch into a logic O condition to disable the compressor through gate 102 and to energize the malfunction light through inverter 134.The input to the latching relay 130 is provided fromNOR gate 136, so that the relay 130 will latch to a low level output condition if any one of the inputs toNOR gate 136 rises to a high level. The signal DTS 2 turns on at a set point suchas indicated in TABLE 3 which is the maximum permissible compressor discharge line temperature. If the temperature reaches this level, the liquid injection will already have been implemented by the signal DTS 1, and it is now necessary to shut down the compressor. As illustrated in figure 3, the turn on transition of the signal DTS 2 is preferably delayed 3 minutes, after which time it will rise to a high level and result in the system operation being latched into an off condition. If the upper compressor discharge pressure point has been exceeded, the signal 3 will already have reduced the system load to its minimum level so that when the signal HPS 2 goes to a high level a system malfunction will be indicated and the latching relay 130 will disable the compressor through the gate 102. Finally, if the compressor suction pressure drops below a predetermined level, the compressor is not operating properly and it will be necessary to disable the system. The turn on transition of the low pressure signal LPS is preferably delayed for 5 minutes. If the suction pressure f low the LPS switch set point for more tban 5 nu.tµs, the LPS signal through latching relay 30 will disable the compressor and indicate a malfunction. The three above described safety function limits will be monitored so that if any of these limits is equalled or exceeded, system operation will be terminated and latched out and the malfunction light energized. Restoration of the system operation after a safety shut down and latch out will preferably require an operation internally of the control block such that it can only be performed by a serviceman or mechanic rather than by the operator himself. The return air group adjustment RT ADJ shown in figure 1 is for the purpose of permitting the system operator to adjust as a group the three set points for the return air temperature signals RAA, RAB and RAC if desired, this adjustment may be made internal to the control block rather than by the operator. The Reset illustrated in figure 1 may be a manual reset button that will de energize the malfunction light and reset the latch out relay 130 when pushed. As indicated above, this switch may also be made internal to the control block 30 for access only by a serviceman or mechanic. The system described above is capable of low, intermediate and full load operating conditions in addition to the zero percent or declutched position while in the A C mode of operation or of heating while in the heat mode of operation. The control block 30 will control these three capacity levels and heating function in accordance with a number of sensed conditions with rising return air temperature causing progressively increasing capacity levels and the relative humidity increasing the capacity level when required in the air conditioning mode of operation and falling return air temperature causing heating to be activated in the heating mode of operation. The return air temperature dictates the primary capacity requirement and the evaporator coil temperature sensor will permit the capacity to be increased to match the imposed load only within the limits of the system. Excessive relative humidity will turn on the system if it is not already running and will raise the capacity level by one step if it is already running.Once the relative humidity sensor is satisfied, the system will be turned off or reduced in capacity in accordance with the RTS output. Although a single preferred embodiment of the system has been described above, it will be apparent that various changes and modifications could be made without departing from the principle of the invention. For example, alternative techniques could be used for latching out system operation other than by a latching relay 130 which provides its output to inverter 134 and each of gates 102 and 100. Further, it will be apparent that the output signals from the control module 30 in figure 1 may require conditioning in order to provide the required power to the various load devices, such signal conditioning being easily accomplished through the use of adequately rated and protected power transistors. Still further, in an electronic system such as described above, electromagnetic interference EMI is a potential hazard and, in the specific case of the input devices, shielded cable may be used when necessary to prevent EMI from entering the control module 30 through the sensor paths. It should also be noted that the logic and signalling scheme described above could be reversed without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, and that the signals referred to in the appended claims may refer to analog signals or to logic 1 or logic 0 signals, or combinations thereof.
