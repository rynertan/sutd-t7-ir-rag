## Description
A DIPEPTIDE SWEETENING COMPOSITION AND ITS USE FOR SWEETENING FOOD, BEVERAGES OR PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONSThe present invention relates. to a dipeptide sweetening composition. More particularly, the present invention is concerned with a dipeptide sweetening composition having a strength and a roundness of taste like sucrose, the sweetness of which is improved over that of dipeptide sweeteners. alone.Dipeptide sweeteners such as c L aspartyl L phenyl alanine methylester are generally known as sweetening agents having a satisfying sweetness characterized by a clear initial sweet taste without an unpleasa nt bitter after taste like saccharin. Problems have arisen, however by the fact, that the sweetness of dipeptide sweeteners does not last as long as that of sucrose, that they show monotonuous sweetness without full bodyness and, moreover, tend to lack roundness in their taste quality.Dipeptide sweeteners could find great commercial application especially as low caloric sweeteners, since the intensity of sweetness of dipeptide sweeteners is about 50 to 200 times or more of that of sucrose and they have no discernible unpleasant aftertaste like saccharin and other synthetic sweetening agents. There is a continuous need therefore for a dipeptide sweetening composition which can be substituted for sucrose and which has almost the same sweetness as sucrose.Accordingly, one object of the present invention is to provide a dipeptide sweetening composition which has a more satisfactory quality of sweetness than that of dipeptide sweeteners alone.Another object of the present invention is to provide a low caloric dipeptide sweetening composition having a sucrose like sweetness for various foods and beverages.According to the present invention it has now been found that the quality in sweetness of dipeptide sweeteners can be significantly improved over that of dipeptide sweeteners alone by the co existence of at least one kind of flavoring agents in an amount sufficient to impart a taste strength equal to that of 10 to 200 by wt. of monosodium L glutamate MSG based upon the weight of the dipeptide sweeteners, selected from the group consisting of sodium glutamate, sodium inosine 5 phosphate IMP , sodium guanosine 5 phosphate GMP and sodium aspartate. Preferred embodiments of the invention may be described as follows.A dipeptide sweetener used in the composition of the present invention is a L aspartyl L phenylalanine methyl ester AP or a L aspartyl L phenylalanine ethylester.Sodium glutamate, sodium inosine 5 phosphate, sodium guanosine 5 phosphate and sodium aspartate are used for the composition as flavoring agents.In the preparation of the sweetening composition of the present invention, generally 10 to 200 by wt., preferably 75 to 125 8 by wt. of MSG is employed based upon the dipeptide sweetener, or other flavoring agents alone or in combination withMSG are used in an amount sufficient to impart a strength of taste equal to the above defined amount of MSG alone.For the combined use of MSG and IMP and or GMP, the amount of IMP and or GMP can be given, for instance, by the following formul Yamaguchi S. J. Food Sci., 32 473 1967 and Yamaguchi et al. Nippon Nogeikagaku Kaishi 42 6 1968 V Y U 1218U FORMULA I V Y U 2800U FORMULA II V P Q Y U 1218U P 3Q FOIULA III U concentration g dll of MSG in a solution containing MSG and IMP, MSG and GMP or MSG, IMP and GMP Y concentration g dll of MSG in a solution containing MSG alone V concentration g dl of IMP in a solution containing 4SG and IMP V concentration g dl of GMP in a solution containing MSG and GMP V concentlation g dll of IMP and GMP in a solution containing MSG, IMP and GMP P IMP IS T GMP Q GMP IMP GMP A composition which contains flavoring agents having a tasting strength of less than 10 by wt. of that ofMSG based on the dipeptide sweetener, shows a pronounced tendency of lacking fulness of its sweetness compared with sucrose. Inversely, if the composition contains more than 200 by wt of MSG the sweetness becomes dim and the taste as a whole becomes heavy and inharmonious.The dipeptide sweetening composition of the present invention can be used in any form such as powder, syrup, granules or tablets. Further, it may be possible that it comprises a dipeptide sweetener in the form of powder, tablets, syrup and the like coexisting with flavoring agents in any form such as powder, granules or liquid. The sweetening composition according to the invention may be used as a sweetener for all kinds of food, beverages or pharmaceutical compositions.Typical examples for the use of the present dipeptide sweetening composition are table use seasonings, sweetening materials for bread, deserts, cakes, candies, chocolate, chewing gum, cookies, ice cream, sherbet or puddings, milk products or their substitutes such as coffee whitener or whipped topping, beverages such as powdered juice or condenced juice and so on.Having generally described this invention, a further understanding can be obtained by reference to certain specific examples which are provided by way of illustration and not by way of limitation.
