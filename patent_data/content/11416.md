# Recovery process for polyesters.

## Abstract
Polymer product, such as a polyester resin, is recovered in finely divided form from a polymer product solvent solu tion by the addition of the solution to a hot, non boiling water phase with non shearing agitation of the resulting composi tion of the water, polymer product, and solvent under condi tions which give rise to turbulence in the composition. The solvent, which has a lower boiling point than the temperature at which the hot water is maintained, boils off from the polymer product, solvent, and water composition and leaves the desired, finely divided, polymer product admixed in the water phase. The product can be recovered by filtration or other suitable separation technique.
