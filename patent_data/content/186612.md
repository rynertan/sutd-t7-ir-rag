# Control system actuator position synthesis for failure detection.

## Abstract
The redundant sensed position signal samples of a position actuator are compared to the synthesized value from an actuator model and rejected for use in the sample period if the difference magnitude between the sample value and the synthesized value exceeds an accepted magnitude, the periodicity of sample rejection is recorded and if the periodicity is sufficiently high the sensed feedback signal itself is rejected for use and the signal s position sensor is recorded as failed if both samples are simultaneously rejected a diagnostic routine determines if the fault is in the sensors or the common actuator.
