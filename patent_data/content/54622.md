# A one way bubble transfer switch.

## Abstract
An improved non data reversing one way bubble transfer switch for contiguous disks is disclosed. The switch includes a conductor 34 having one edge thereof substantially parallel to and overlapping a major loop 32 which is in the form of a plurality of scallops. The major loop extends in a direction substantially transversely to one of the three primary crystallographic axes in the bubble material so as to have a propagation track with a high margin on one side and a low propagation margin on the other side. The tip of a minor loop 40A, B, C, D end portion is aligned substantially concentric with the scalloped tip portion 36 of the major loop 32 . This switch has a maximum bias field margin and a maximum phase margin.
