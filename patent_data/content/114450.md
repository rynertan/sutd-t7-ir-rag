# Frozen bread dough.

## Abstract
A frozen bread dough which can be prepared from the freezer to a finished baked loaf within about one hour without thawing has been accomplished by using a novel process including a two step fermentation time. Because the bread dough is yeast leavened, desirous yeast leavened flavor and aroma is obtainable. The dough can be formulated for extended frozen storage stability through the addition of hydrophilic colloids, film forming proteins and surfactants.
