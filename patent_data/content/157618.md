# POROUS SUBSTRATE WITH ABSORBED ANTISTAT OR SOFTENER, USED WITH DETERGENT

## Abstract
A bead, useful in a fabric aqueous laundering process to in part to the fabric, when dried, at least one of the properties i softness, and ii antistatic effect, comprises a porous sub strate, and substance absorbed onto said substrate to produce at least one of said i and ii properties in the fabric. A barrier layer may be formed about said substrate and characterised as dispersing in laundry wash water a solubilizing or dispersion aid such as a nonionic surfactant may be mixed with said sub stance and also absorbed onto the substrate and a hardener may be mixed with said substance and also absorbed onto the substrate.
