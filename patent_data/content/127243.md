## Description
Thermo magneto optical recording device and recording element therefor. The invention relates to a thermo magneto optical recording device, comprising a recording element having a substrate which supports a magneto optically active layer, a source of laser radiation, means to focus radiation of the laser source onto selective places of the recording element, and magneto optical detection means placed in the path of radiation returning from the magneto optically active layer, comprising a polarisation optical system and a photo electric detector, the magneto optically active layer being present between the laser source and a layer reflecting radiation from the laser source. The invention also relates to a recording element for such a device. It is known from Journal of Applied Physics,Vol. 53, No. 6, June 1982, E. 4491 93 that materials, for example InBi, GdFe, TbFe and GdCo may be used for a recording element, for example in the form of a magnetooptical disc, which is destined for use in an optical recording device. These materials are usually vapour deposited or sputtered in a vacuum onto a glass substrate, a silicon plate or the like so as to provide a thin film for a magneto optical recording element. Magneto optical recording elements have the following properties in common.First, the easy axis of magnetisation is perpendicular to the surface of the film, and second, the magnetic transition temperatures, which are the Curie temperature and the compensation temperature of the film material, are comparatively low. Since the easy axis of magnetisation is in a direction perpendicular to the surface of the film, binary information in the form of 1 s and O s can be recorded by using upward, and downward magnetisation of the film on the substrate for these two values and hence the device may be used as a digital memory. A method of thermo magne ticallx recording information which is known as Curie point writing is as follows. First of all, the whole film is mag otized , for example, in the downward direction and is designated tOn, Mien a n 1 n is to be recorded, a laser beam is directed to the region where the recording is to be effected and simultaneously an upwardly directed external magnetic field is applied.The irradiated region is heated by tile laser energy to a temperature in the proximity of the Curie temperature, and, upon cooling, the magnetisation of the external field is flcapturedfl and the direction thereof is adopted by the film, so that a 1 is recorded.When the information nO is to be recorded, the relevant place is not irradiated by the laser beam, because theinitial state is already on. When a region which is not irradiated by a laser beam is kept at a temperature which is suffi ciently far below the Curie temperature or has a suffi ciently large coercive force Hc, its direction of magnetisation is not reversed by an externally applied magnetic field and the downward magnetisation on O is maintained. When the stored information is read, a plane polarized light beam is used which scans the recording element in which, depending on whether the magnetisation in a read bit place is up or down, the reflected beam experiences a rotation of the plane of polarisation in one or the other direction. This is referred to as magnetooptical reading. In order to make the use of thermo magnetic recording systems with magneto optical reading attractive, certain conditions need to be satisfied both as regards writing and reading. In order to achieve a sufficient signal to noise ratio, the magneto optical quality factor or figure of merit which comprises the product of the magneto optical angle of rotation squared and the transmission or reflection of the film must be as large as possible. The magnetooptical figure of merit is comparatively small when the metallic magneto optical materials mentioned hereinbefore are used in reflection because the magneto optical rotation in reflection the Kerr rotation is comparatively small, but is also small when used in transmission because the absorption is high.From the above mentioned publication in Journal of Applied Physics it is known that when metallic layers are used in reflection the figure of merit can be increased by making the metallic layer sufficiently thin and by placing a reflector behind it at an accurately determined distance, producing the so called trilayer system. On the other hand, a higher magneto optical figure of merit can be real ized by using mono crystalline magnetooptical materials having a garnet structure which in transmission in a given wavelength range show a very high Faraday rotation in combination with a low absorption. However, as a result of the low absorption this type of material has disadvantages in the writing process. flue to the low absorption there is a poor coupling in of light into the film, i.e. the energy transfer is low. As a result of this, much more laser power is necessary to heat the layer to the Curie temperature than is the case with metallic layers of comparable thickness. Although the coupling in can be increased by making the layer thicker, very small bits cannot be recorded in thick layers. The recording density in that case is not optimum. It is an object of the invention to provide a device of the type mentioned in the opening paragraph in which an improved signal to noise ratio in the reading process is combined with a sufficiently high recording density and with an efficient writing process. The invention provides a thermo magneto optical recording device, comprising a recording element having a substrate which supports a magneto optically active layer, a source of laser radiation, means to focus radiation of the laser source onto selected places of the recording element, the magneto optically active layer being present between the laser source and a layer reflecting radiation from the laser source, and magneto optical detection means placed in the path of radiation returning through the magneto optically active layer, comprising a polarisa tion optical system and a photo electric detector, wherein the magneto optically active layer is a poly crystalline 3 oxidic layer of a material based on Fe and having a spinel structure and a thickness dl, and wherein a layer of a dielectric material which has a thickness d2 and is transparent to radiation of the laser source is present between the magneto optically active layer and the reflective layer, dl and d2 being chosen so that destructive interference occurs between the plane polarized radiation of the laser source returning from the surface of the magneto optically active layer and the radiation returning from the reflective layer and which has traversed the two layers at least twice, the thickness d1 being too small to produce such destructive interference in the absence of the dielectric layer. Layers of oxidic, ferro magnetic materials based on iron having a spinel structure, for example magnetite Fe3O4 and, in particular, substituted or non substituted cobalt ferrite cho, Fe 304 in themselves do not show a high magneto optical Faraday or Kerr effect, and therefore may not seem fit for use if the signal to noise ratio of a magneto optical system is to be increased. But it has been found possible using the specific absorption coefficient in a specific wavelength range to design an optical layer system with these layers which, as regards reading properties, is much superior to systems having metallic films and, as regards writing properties, is much superior to systems having garnet films. Experiments underlying the present invention have demonstrated that the thickness of the magneto optically active layer of an oxidic iron based poly crystalline material placed between the light source and a reflective layer may be chosen so that destructive interference occurs for the source wavelength. This means that the light ray reflected at the outer face of the active layer is in opposite phase with the light rays returning through this layer via the reflecting layer. This is associated with an extreme value in the magneto optical rotation of the detec ted radiation at certain thicknesses of the magneto opti calls active layer which are specific for the material.That is, the magneto optical effect as a function of the layer thickness shows a peaked structure. The above implies that if for certain reasons the thickness of the magneto optical layer cannot be freely chosen, the magnetooptical effect may be weak. The invention provides the interposition of a dielectric layer between the magnetooptically active layer and the reflective layer. By suitably choosing the thickness of the dielectric layer, the peaked structure of the magneto optical effect can be smeared as a function of the layer thickness. As a result, the thickness of the magneto optically active layer is less critical and can be given, for example, a thickness which from the point of view of thermal conductivity is most favourable. As the layer is made thicker, spot widening becomes more and more prominent. Although the magneto optical rotation increases with increasing value of the thickness of the magnetooptically active layer the reflection decreases. This implies that at this point also a compromise determines the layer thickness to be used in a system. On the one hand the writing process requires a coupling in of the light which is as efficient as possible, and hence a reflection which is as low as possible. On the other hand, the reading process requires the signal to be sufficiently strong and hence a lower limit is imposed upon the reflection, dependent on the system. Said lower limit for a practical case is, for example, 10 . A laser which is very suitable for the present application is an AlGaAs laser which emits radiation in the wavelength range from 730 870 nm. Optionally, an He Ne laser which operates in a range around 630 nm, could be considered. Using their favourable absorption coefficient in the wavelength range from 400 900 nm, the above described optimisation is possible in oxidic materials based on Foe3 and having a spinel structure, for example, the said magnetite and cobalt ferrites, but not in materials having a garnet basis which have too low an absorption therefor. The reflecting layer may be a multilayer dielec tric diciiroic mirror consisting of 1 4 layers having alternately a high and low refractive index, or a metal layer for example Ag, Al or Au . The dielectic intermediate layer may also serve to increase the optical quality of the system of layers.Since the poly crystalline magneto optically active layer generally has a granular structure, which may be the case when tfie layer is provided by means of a spraying method rather than when the layer is provided by means of a sputtering process, the provision thereon of a smooth dielectric layer, preferably having approximately the same refractive index, may cause noise, occurring as a result of the granularity, to be supressed. B providing an intermediate layer of a dielectric material having a suitable surface tension, by means of a spinning process, on the magneto optically active layer, the top of the layer of dielectric material on which the reflective layer is provided in a subsequent stage, may be made very smooth. Thereby the occurrence of stray phenomena at the reflective layer is avoided as much as possible. Materials for the intermediate layer which are suitable from the point of view of spinnability are, in addition to photo lacquers, polymerized synthetic resins, for example epoxy resins, phenol resins, poly carbonate resins, polyimide resins and polyacrylate resins. When at a selected wavelength in the range from 400 900 nm the refractive index of the dielectric material does not differ more than 15 from that of the magneto optically active material, little reflection will occur at the rough surface of the magneto optically active layer. Thereby also noise is suppressed. In combination with a magneto optically active layer of cobalt ferrite n rv 2.7 for example, CeO n oo9., and Zns n ,v2.4 are considered suitable as a material for the dielectric intermediate layer from the punt of view of refractive index. The invention relates in particular to a thermomagneto optical memory device as described hereinbefore having a recording element in the form of a rotatable disc. An embodiment of the invention will now be described in greater detail, by way of example, with reference to the acoompanying drawings, in which, Fig. 1 shows diagrammatically a thermo magnetooptical recording device, Figs. 2a and 2b are cross sectional views through alternative recording elements for a thermo magneto optical recording device according to the invention, Fig. 3 is a graph show ing the Kerr rotation e K for light having a wavelength of 780 nm as a function of the optical thickness n1 d1 of the magneto optical layer of a system of layers shown in the inset, Fig. 4 is a graph showing the reflection coeffi cient R, the Kerr rotation e and the figure of merit K 2 K 2R as a function of the optical thickness of the dielectric layer of a system of layers shown in the inset of Fig. 3, Fig. 5 is a graph showing the optimum optical thickness n2d2 opt of the dielectric layer of a system of layers shown in the inset of Fig. 3 as a function of the thickness of the associated magneto optically active layer, and Fig. 6 ia a graph showing the optimized Kerr rotation 2 t as a function of the optical thickness n 1d1 of the magneto optically active layer of the system of layers shown in the inset of Fig. 3. Fig. 1 shows a thermo magneto optical recording device having a recording element 1 which is shown as a section of a disc rotable about an axis 9. A laser source 3 is accommodated at some distance above the surface 4 of the recording element 1. The laser source 3 is, for example, an AlGaAs diode laser which can emit light waves having a wavelength in the range between 730 and 870 nm. A chracteristic wavelength is 7 O nm. Such lasers are small and suitable for being arranged so as to be movable for example radially with respect to the recording element. The light of laser source 3 is focused on pointP of the recording element 1 by means a system of lenses 5,6. A polarizer 7 which is used at least in the reading process is placed in the light path. A semi transmissive mirror 8 sharing a transmission T of for example 90 , is placed in the light path so as to send a part of the light after reflection to a detection device 9 for controlling the correct focusing. A semi transmissive mirror 10 T is placed in the light path to send a part of the light after reflection, via an analyzer 11 and a lens 12, to a photo electric detector 13 for example an Siavalanche detector .In the writing process, focused radiation of laser source 3 is used to heat a selected information bit in magneto optically active layer 16 see fig. 2 of recording element 1, which has been previously magnetized in the direction M, to a temperature in the proximity of its Curie temperature. AcharacteristicCurie temperature of unsubstituted cobalt ferrites is appro ximately 5200C. Such a rise in temperature, together with the energisation of coil 14 with which an opposite fieldM in the order of 1,000 Oe is generated, is sufficient to reverse the magnetisation of the irradiated information bit upon cooling. The reading process takes place in reflection with reduced power by means of the same laser source 3. The plane of polarisation of the plane polarized light beam incident on the recording element 1 is rotated through a given angle after reflection. Dependent on the presence of a non or a n1 said rotation is converted into an intensity difference by means of the analyser 11 in front of the photo diode 13. In order to obtain a combination of a low writing power with a maximum magneto optical effect, recor dinr element 1 is constructed from a magneto optically active layer having a very specific composition and thick ness and is combined with a dielectric layer and a reflec ting layer. fig. 2a shows a non magnetic substrate 15 which, for example, may be of amorphons Six on which a magne to optically active layer 16 is provided. Within the scope of the invention the layer 16 consists of a poly crystalline oxidic material based on Fe3 , having a spinel crystal structure, for example, Fe304 or Co, Fe 304. By way of example, materials of the type Co, Fe 304 cobalt ferrite will be described hereinafter, in particular having the composition Cove204. The present poly crystalline materials have been provided on a surface which is sufficiently large for the present application, for example, by a spraying process with a sufficiently large perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. This in contrast with, for example, monocrystalline garnet materials.Moreover, their absorption at the wavelengths in question 730 870 nm is very favourable both as regards the writing process and the reading process. Thickness d1 of layer 16 is, within certain limits, related to the wavelength of the laser source 3 used and to the absorption of the material of the layer 16 so as to obtain a useful magneto optical effect originating from a beam 19a reflected at the interface 16 15 and beams 20, 21, 22 etc. returning after reflection at a metallic reflective layer 18. As a result of the absorption in the layer 16, the reflection f 1 at the layer 18, and the reflection at the interface 15 16, the intensities of the returning light beams become gradually smaller.A dielectric layer 17, which is transparent to the wavelength used and has a thickness d2 which is chosen to obtain an optimum magneto optical rotation, in combination with the thickness d1 of the layer 16, is present between the layers 16 and 18. How this choise is made, will be explained hereinafter. In the fig. 2a construction the light is incident on the magneto optically active layer 16 via the substrate 15. However, as shown in Fig. 2b, the construction may also be such that the light is incident directly on the magneto optically active layer 16. In that case the reflective layer 18 is present between the substrate 15 and the magnoto optically active layer iti. recording element having a layer structure as shown iii the inset in fig. 3 it appears that in the absence of in intermediate layer 1 d2 the Kerr rotation 2 t as a function of the optical thickness n1d1 of the magneto optically active CoFe204 layer 16 has a strongly peaked variation in which the layer thicknesses at which the maxima occur depend on the wavelength of the light used. The graph shown in fig. 3 represents the situation when light having a wavelength A 780 nm is used. The peaked variation of the Kerr rotation is associated with whether destructive interference in the layer 16 does or does not occur.That destructive interference occurs with a value of n1d1 of 0.57 um and that the light beam is not merely doubled up appears from the fact that in the latter case the rotation cannot be much more than twice the Faraday rotation, being 1.bio for a layer thickness of 0.57 um. As a result of destructive inter ference, however, a rotation 2 GX of 3.5 is measured. K An extreme value 2 0K 80 occurs at n1d1 0.96 um.These maxima in the rotation are associated with reflection minima. At n1d1 0.57 um the reflection coefficientR is 20 , at nldl 0.96 um, R is 6 Fig. 4 . If now for other reasons the layer 16 cannot have a thickness at which a maximum in the Kerr rotation occurs, the value of the rotation drops rather strongly.In that case said drop can be restricted considerably according to the invention by interposing a layer 17 of a dielectric material between the magneto optically active layer 16 and the reflective layer 18. In order to reach the desired result the optical thickness n2d2 of such an intermediate layer 17 must be accurately adjusted to the optical thickness n1d1 of the layer 16. This will be explained with reference to fig. 4. This figure shows how, starting from a layer 16 of CoFe2O4 having an optical thickness nldl 0o39 Zum, the Kerr rotation 2 varies by the interposition of a dielectric layer 17 having an optical thickness n2d2 varying from 0 to 0.6 um.The xariatioll or the reflection coefficient R and the variation of the figure of merit 2 K R IT are also shown. From this it can be derived that a suitable value for n2d2 would be, for example, 0.19 m. A wider or narrower range of values about 0.19 um may also be useful, dependent on the maximum reduction of 2 K 2R for example 50 which still leads to a useful system. The best suitable optical thickness n2d2 for a dielectric intermediate layer 17 can be determined with reference to solid lines shown in the graph of figure 5 for optical thicknesses n1d1 of a magneto optically active layer 16 of CoFe2O4 varying from 0 to 0.78 um. A shaded area is drawn about each line. Said shaded areas indicate which values of n2d2 are still useful when a reduction up to 50 of the optical Kerr rotation is permitted. Fig. 6 shows the Kerr rotation 2 9 K opt opti mized in the manner described hereinbefore as a function of the optical thickness n1d1 of a magneto optically active layer 16 of CoFe2O4 in the system of layers of fig. 2a. The difference from the situation shown in fig. 3 is evident. Spinning a dielectric intermediate layer 17 from the liquid phase for example, a diluted photolacquer on layer 16 may be of great advantage in a system of layers of the type shown in fig. 2a to obtain a smooth surface on which the reflecting layer 18 can be provided. The smoother this surface is, the less will be the noise. An improvement of 20 dB has proved realizable in this manner.Whether or not it is used in combination with the spinning of layer 17, the material of layer 17 desirably has a refractive index n which corresponds as much as possible to that of the material of the layer 16. It is to be noted that for the Foe3 ions in Co, Fe 304 other ions, for example, Al3 , Rh3 , Mn3 and Cr3 may be substituted to reduce the Curie temperature, if necessary. When the Curie temperature drops, however, the magnetisation and hence the rotation at room temperature also drop. If this is not desired, instead of the above mentio ied substitutions Co X , substitution may be done by means in which X is a quadrivalent or a quintavalent metal ion for example Ti , Sun , Ir V5 . Altllollgh the magnetisation at room temperature also drops the detrimental effect thereof is restricted in that the rotation increases slightly. Another effect of the substitution of metal ions, for example, CoFe204, is that the refractive index n changes. For example, if n becomes smaller, a larger thickness of the magneto optically active layer is necessary to maintain the same optimum value of the Kerr rotation.If a thicker layer is not desired, for example, because more thermal energy would then be necessary to write the bits, the invention provides the possibility of restricting the loss in Kerr rotation which would occur by suitably choosing the thickness of the dielectric intermediate layer.
