# Solid phase deformation process.

## Abstract
A process for the deformation of a workpiece comprising an orientable, thermoplastic polymer by passage in the solid phase through a die having both an entry side and an exit side, which process comprises providing the workpiece comprising the orientable, thermoplastic polymer which is initially present, at least in part, in an extended chain crystalline morphology at the entry side of the die causing the workpiece to deform in the solid phase through the die and collecting the deformed workpiece from the exit side of the die.
