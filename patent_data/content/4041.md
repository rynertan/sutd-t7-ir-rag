# Apparatus for limiting the fluid volume output in a rotary pump.

## Abstract
Apparatus for limiting the fluid volume output in a hydraulic pump of the type including a by pass valve. The by pass valve is disposed within a portion of the pump housing 15 which extends axially into the fluid reservoir 19 and defines a pair of by pass ports. The pump is preferably balanced and includes a pair of diametrically opposed inlet kidney ports. A tubular member 111, 113 is used to direct a portion of the by pass fluid from each of the by pass ports toward the adjacent inlet kidney. Each of the tubular members is disposed to direct the by pass flow axially into the inlet kidney, thus improving filling of the pumping pockets, and reducing cavitation and the resultant noise.
