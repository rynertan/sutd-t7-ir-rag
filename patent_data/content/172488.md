# Contact arrangement for a current limiting circuit breaker.

## Abstract
A contact arrangement for a current limiting circuit breaker wherein at least two movable contact arms 15, 16, 20 are interconnected by means of a pair of connecting arms 40, 42 and a manually operable push rod 50 . An electro magnet 120 ... 420 is operatively coupled with at least one of the contact arms 15, 16 for holding the same in an open condition when the electromagnet 120 ... 420 is de energized. The disclosed contact arrangement allows the circuit breaker to be multifunctionally employed as an integrated combination motor starter.
