# Equipment for putting in approximal fillings with light hardening materials.

## Abstract
The equipment makes it possible to cause the polymer ization of resin by light, starting from the approximal apical zone 8 of the tooth, i.e. at the base of the filling. It comprises a wedge 1 transparent to the rays used for polymerization of the resin inserted in the approximal zone i.e., between teeth , a wedge shaped to refract or reflect the concentrated light provided it by a lighting device equipped with a cap with a converging lens, in the axial direction, deflecting it and emitting it in the lateral direction 9 , so as to illuminate the filling resin with greater intensity at its base 8 , avoiding fissures 15 between the filling and base of the tooth, which would occur if the illumination were performed, as is now done at 14 starting from the occlusal mastica tory part of the tooth.
