# Cementitious composition, a method to prepare it and shaped article derived therefrom.

## Abstract
In German Offenlegungsschrift 2 649 120 we have de scribed cured polymer containing cementitious composi tions of high modulus of rupture. The cured compositions are made by curing the product of subjecting to a homo genisation process comprising high shear mixing e.g. extrusion or calendering the ingredients hydraulic cement, water and a selected water dispersible polymer. The poly mer is selected by a test which determines thermally its effect of the cement hydration reaction. The present in vention describes the use in similar compositions of a class of water dispersible acidic polymer, not selected by the above mentioned test, which contains a specified propor tion of carboxyl groups. Shaped products comprised of the new cured compo sitions of high modulus of rupture are useful, for example, in building applications where previously it was necessary to employ asbestos in admixture with the cement.
