# Variable flow gas turbine engine.

## Abstract
A variable flow gas turbine engine of the type having a combustor for generating combustion gases and a turbine rotor for receiving and expanding the hot combustion gases, has an outer wall and an end wall defining a channel for directing the flow of combustion gases from the combustor to the rotor a plurality of fixed guide vanes mounted in the channel, the space between adjacent vanes forming at least one throat a winglet fixedly mounted in the throat for sep arating the gases flowing through the throat into first and second streams and a passage through at least one of the vanes into the throat, the passage being in fluid communi cation with source of air under pressure for injecting high pressure into the throat for closing off the flow of combustion gases through the second stream.
