## Description
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of d 2 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, in the following herein described as naproxen and naproxen salts respectively. Naproxen is a well known anti inflammatory, analgesic and anti pyretic agent. Naproxen and naproxen salts are optically active substances which, in general, can be prepared from mixtures of the d and l enantiomer. European Patent Application 79102502.6 and European Patent Application 80103828.2 describe the preparation of naproxen and naproxen salts by employing an N R D glucamine or a salt thereof, where R is alkyl having 1 to 36 carbon atoms, or cycloalkyl having 3 to 8 carbon atoms as resolving agent. The resolution method described in these two European patent applications includes forming salts of mixtures of the two enantiomers with the N R D glucamine which are then subjected to fractional crystallization and the less soluble naproxen salt is separated from the other, more soluble enantiomer salt by crystallization. British Patent Specification No. 1,274,271 describes the preparation of d,l 2 5 halo 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acids and that these acids can be resolved with alkaloids such as cinchonidine. GB A 2098981 was published after the priority dates of the present application, and discloses a process involving the use of N methyl D glucamine to resolve dl 2 5 halo 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid by fractional crystallization of the d salt from a specific solvent system, followed by hydrogenation of the 5 halo group. Published counterparts to GB A 2098981 exist in other designated states, for example, CH 651289 and AT B 390 253. EP 7116 and EP 22529 disclose the use of N methyl D glucamine and N higher alkyl D glucamine as resolving agents in the preparation of naproxen or derivatives thereof. However they do not suggest the resolution of naproxen precursors, wherein one or more additional steps have to be carried out on the resolved product to convert the precursor to naproxen. It has now been found that N R D glucamines or salts thereof, where R is alkyl having 1 to 18 carbon atoms, preferably 2 to 18 carbon atoms or cycloalkyl with 3 to 8 carbon atoms, preferably N R D glucamines containing 5 to 8 carbon atoms can be employed as resolving agents for the preparation of certain naproxen precursors which can be readily converted to naproxen. Therefore, the present invention comprises N R D glucamines or salts thereof as resolving agents for the preparation of naproxen precursors. These resolving agents form diastereomeric dl naproxen precursor salts from which the naproxen precursor salt can be isolated. The preferred method of separation involves fractional crystallization of the diastereomeric salts. The present invention thus entails the use of these resolving agents with naproxen precursors which, while sharing the propionic acid function with naproxen, are characterized by the presence of substituents located in that part of the naproxen molecule which is remote from the center of the chirality of the molecule. These substituents can be readily converted to the naproxen substitution. In a preferred embodiment, the distance of these convertible substituents between their point of attachment to the naphthalene ring and the center of chirality, i.e., the carbon atom to which the methyl group is attached, is between about 5.8 to 6.6A. Substituents that are specifically preferred according to the present invention are halogen substituents in position 5 of the naphthyl ring and a hydroxy group in position 6 of the molecule. Both groups can be readily converted to the substituents of naproxen i.e., a hydrogen atom in position 5 and a methoxy group in position 6 , while retaining the stereoconfiguration of the molecule. More specifically the naproxen precursors are represented by the compounds of formula I wherein R¹ is hydrogen or methyl when X is halogen selected from the group of chloro and bromo, and n is 1 or R¹ is hydrogen when n is 0. These naproxen precursors also include salts of the compounds of formula I . The compounds of formula I in form of their racemic mixtures are known compounds. For example, the compound d,l 2 5 bromo 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid is described in German Patent 1,934,460 this is the compound of formula I wherein R¹ is methyl, X is bromo and n is 1 . The compound of formula I wherein R¹ is methyl, X is chloro and n is 1 is described, in form of its racemic mixture, in Belgian Patent 752,627. The compounds of formula I wherein R¹ is hydrogen, X is halogen and n is 0 or 1 are described, in form of their racemic mixtures, in German Application No. 1793825 and in Italian Patent Application 25778 A 76. However many of the salts of the compounds of formula I and the individual enantiomers of the compounds of formula I have not been before described. CH A 651289 and GB A 2098981 and other corresponding publications describe and claim certain aspects of the resolution of d and l 2 5 bromo 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl proprionic acid with N methyl D glucamine. However, these specifications were not published before the filing of the present application. Subject, therefore, to the terms of the appended claims The term alkyl as used herein refers to and includes straight and branched chain hydrocarbon groups having 1 to 18 carbon atoms. Typical alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, n propyl, i propyl, n butyl, i butyl, n hexyl, n octyl, n dodecyl, and n octadecyl, and the like. The term cycloalkyl as used herein refers to and includes cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon groups having 3 to 8 carbon atoms. Typical cycloalkyl groups include cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, methylcyclohexyl, cycloheptyl and cyclooctyl. Of the cycloalkyl groups, cyclohexyl and cycloheptyl are presently preferred. Presently preferred resolving agents include those N alkyl glucamines wherein R is alkyl having 2 to 18 carbon atoms, and more preferred agents are wherein R is alkyl having 6 to 18 carbon atoms. Presently particularly preferred resolving agents within the scope of this invention are N ethyl D glucamine, N n propyl D glucamine, N n butyl D glucamine, and N n octyl D glucamine, N n decyl D glucamine and n hexadecyl D glucamine. A presently preferred resolving agent is N methyl D glucamine in connection with the naproxen precursor of formula I , wherein R¹ is hydrogen and X is halogen from the group of chloro and bromo and n is 1 or R¹ is hydrogen and n is 0. The resolution step of this invention is conducted in an inert organic solvent having a pronounced difference between the solubilities of the salt of the naproxen precursor of formula I with the resolving agent and the salt of the other enantiomer with the resolving agent, generally at temperatures between room or ambient temperature and an elevated temperature generally up to the reflux temperature of the solvent utilized. The salt of the naproxen precursor with the resolving agent for example, N methyl D glucamine, N n propyl D glucamine, N n butyl D glucamine or N n octyl D glucamine should be significantly less soluble in the selected solvent than is the salt of the other enantiomer thereof with the resolving agent and, accordingly, upon the cooling of a heated solution thereof, generally to or about ambient or room temperature, such salt of the naproxen precursor with the resolving agent will be preferentially crystallized therefrom. Suitable solvents include water, C₁ to C₁₀ monohydric alcohols in particular C₁ to C₁₀ alkanols , such as, for example, methanol, ethanol, n propanol, isopropanol, butanol, pentanol, hexanol, cyclohexanol, 2 ethylhexanol, benzyl alcohol, furfuryl alcohol, and the like, C₂ to C₆ dihydric alcohols, such as, for example, ethylene glycol, 1,2 propylene glycol, 1,3 propylene glycol, and the like, C₃ to C₄ trihydric alcohols, such as for example, glycerol, and the like, C₃ to C₁₁ ketones, such as, for example, acetone, acetylacetone, ethyl methyl ketone, diethyl ketone, di n propyl ketone, diisopropyl ketone, diisobutyl ketone, and the like. Other solvents include mono and di lower alkyl ether of ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol, dimethylsulfoxide, sulfolanes, formamide, dimethylformamide, N methyl pyrrolidone, pyridine, dioxane, dimethylacetamide, and the like. The C₁ to C₃ alcohols, e.g. methanol and isopropanol, particularly methanol, are the presently preferred solvents. Sufficient water can be added to the solvent if needed to solubilize all of the materials which have been added thereto. Mixtures of polar solvents with aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene or benzene, for example methanol and toluene, with methanol being the major component, can be used as solvent medium. The starting material i.e., the mixture of the naproxen precursors and the other enantiomer thereof or soluble salts thereof is heated to an elevated temperature, generally to a temperature in the range from about 60 C to about 100 C or the reflux temperature of the solvent, in the presence of the resolving agent to solubilize all of the materials which have been added to the solvent. If desired, the solvent can be held at the elevated temperature until all of the materials have gone into solution. After the solution has been held at the elevated temperature for the desired length of time, it is slowly cooled to ambient temperature. During the cooling process, the solution is preferably seeded with a salt of the naproxen precursor and the resolving agent. The crystalline precipitate which results is enriched in the salt of the naproxen precursor with the resolving agent. The final temperature to which the solution is taken is chosen by practical considerations but generally is selected so that the temperature difference will be sufficient to provide a high yield of crystals. The crystallizing mixture can be maintained at the lower temperature until crystallization is complete, or nearly so, usually for about 30 minutes to about several hours or so. The crystalline precipitate which results is removed by filtration and washed. The crystalline material which is obtained at this stage in the process i.e., a material which is enriched in the salt of the naproxen precursor with the resolving agent , after separation by filtration and washing, can be charged to water and heated, if necessary, to redissolve the crystalline material. For those N R D glucamines which are soluble in water, the resulting solution is acidified for example with a mineral acid, such as sulphuric acid or hydrochloric acid, or an organic acid such as acetic acid, and the crystalline precipitate so obtained is separated by filtration, washed and dried. There results a crystalline product substantially enriched in the naproxen precursor. Alternatively, for those N R D glucamines which are insoluble in water, the material enriched in the salt of the naproxen precursor with such a resolving agent can be treated with a strong base, such as, for example, potassium hydroxide or other strong base having a pKa value greater than 10, to cleave the salt, followed by filtration to remove the resolving agent and acidification of the filtrate with, for example, a mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid, or an organic acid such as acetic acid, to give, after filtration, washing and drying, a crystalline product substantially enriched in the naproxen precursor. Prior to the cleavage of the material enriched in the salt of the naproxen precursor with the resolving agent to obtain the optically pure naproxen precursor, it is generally desirable to redissolve the enriched salt material in further solvent material, heat the solvent to the desired normally elevated temperature, seed the resultant solution with the salt of the naproxen precursor with the resolving agent, and cool the resultant solution to effect one or more further recrystallizations. Each such recrystallization further increases the proportion of the salt of the naproxen precursor with the resolving agent in the recrystallized material. N methyl D glucamine, N ethyl D glucamine, N n propyl D glucamine, N n butyl D glucamine, N n hexyl D glucamine and N n octyl D glucamine are particularly suitable resolving agents within the scope of this invention because, with merely one recrystallization step prior to the redissolution of the resultant crystalline product and subsequent acidification, a product having a purity on the order of about of 97 99 of pure naproxen precursor can be obtained. N methyl D glucamine, N ethyl D glucamine, and N n octyl D glucamine, however, are the presently preferred resolving agents because their naproxen precursor salts are readily recoverable by filtration, and the naproxen precursor of acceptably high optical purity can be obtained without need for one or more recrystallizations prior to the cleaving step, and the resolving agent can be recovered directly and in high yield on the order of about 97 98 by filtration. Additionally, the cleavage can be conducted under either alkaline or acidic conditions. The N n octyl D glucamine is substantially insoluble in water, thus permitting recovery thereof in high yields from aqueous systems. This is also true for other resolving agents of this invention where R is alkyl having at least 6 carbon atoms, e.g., those resolving agents where R is alkyl having from 6 to 18 carbon atoms. The material enriched in the other enantiomer of formula I or the N R D glucamine salt thereof where R is as defined above can be processed to recover the other enantiomer which can then be racemized according to known techniques. See, for example, Dyson, U.S. Patent No. 3,686,183. The amount of resolving agent employed on a molar basis relative to the d,l acid of formula I being resolved in accordance with the present invention ranges from between about 50 and 100 . However, as only about 50 on a molar basis relative to the d,l acid being resolved of the resolving agent is needed to form the more insoluble salt thereof with the naproxen precursor, the remainder of the resolving agent generally on the order of up to about 40 50 molar can be replaced, if desired, with a more inexpensive base, including, for example, an inorganic base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, or an organic base having a pKa value of at least 8, such as an organic tertiary amine such as triethylamine, triethanolamine, tributylamine, etc. The terms mixture of d and l enantiomer of formula I is also intended to include those salts thereof which are soluble in the solvent utilized in the resolution process of this invention. Such salts include, for example, the corresponding sodium salts, potassium salts, lithium salts, and the like. Such salts can be prepared by the addition of base, such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example, sodium or potassium hydroxide, to a solution of the mixture of the d and l of formula I acid. The resulting mixture of d 2 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid and l 2 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid salts can be resolved according to the present invention by use of a salt of the resolving agent which will react to form a salt of d 2 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid with the N R D glucamine. Suitable glucamine salts include, salts of inorganic or organic acids, for example, the hydrochloride salt and the acetate salt. Other salts include the propionate salt, butyrate salt, isobutyrate salt, sulfate salt, nitrate salt, maleate salt and the like. Accordingly, the term N R D glucamine where R is as defined above is intended to include those salts thereof which, when used with an appropriate salt of the mixture of d and l 2 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid, will afford the resolution contemplated hereby. The acids of formula I are prepared by known methods as described earlier. See German Patent 1,934,460, Belgian Patent 752,627, German Patent Application 1,668,654 and German Patent Application 1793825 and Italian Patent Application 25778 A 76. After the naproxen precursor of formula I has been obtained in optically pure or in crude form it can be converted into naproxen or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. For the compounds of formula I wherein R¹ is hydrogen or methyl and X is halogen, and n is 1 the conversion to naproxen involves dehalogenation of the compounds of formula I . This process thus entails the replacement of halogen with hydrogen. If R¹ is hydrogen and X is halogen and n is 1 it is preferred to methylate the compound first, as described below, and then to remove the halogen in the 5 position. The 2 5 halo 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid precursor of naproxen can be subjected to dehalogenation reactions which do not affect the structure of the remainder of the molecule under formation of naproxen. A suitable method comprises the reaction of the resolved 5 halo compounds of formula I with an earth alkaline metal alcoholate such as magnesium alcoholate, for example, magnesium methylate and a tertiary amine such as tri lower alkyl amines, for example, triethylamine in an inert solvent such as the alcohol or alkanol from which the alcoholate or alkanolate is derived. The reaction is conducted between 30 C and the reflux temperature of the solvent. For example, a mixture of magnesium powder, methanol and a molar excess of triethylamine are mixed and the mixture maintained under an inert atmosphere such as a nitrogen atmosphere. Resolved 2 5 halo 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid is added in an anhydrous methanol solution. After the reaction is completed, i.e. after one hour at reflux temperature, hydrochloric acid is added to the reaction mixture to dissolve all the remaining magnesium. From the reaction mixture naproxen can be recovered according to known methods. For example, the reaction mixture containing naproxen can be poured into water and extracted with a suitable solvent such as methylene chloride. The organic layer is separated, washed with water and pure naproxen crystallizes out. In another variant, the naproxen precursor of formula I is reacted with at least 2 preferably 2 to 50 mole equivalents calculated on the basis of aluminum of a nickel aluminum or cobalt aluminum alloy in the presence of at least 2, preferably 2 to 50 mole equivalents of alkali metal hydroxide in an inert solvent until the 5 halo group is removed. The preferred nickel aluminum or cobalt aluminum alloys have a particle size of under one millimeter and the aluminum concentration should be at least 10 by weight of the alloy. Suitable alkali metal hydroxides are sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide or lithium hydroxide. The reaction is conducted in an inert solvent which is preferably methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, tertiary butanol, tetrahydrofuran, or dioxan. The reaction temperature is between 0 C and the reflux temperature of the solvent, preferably at least 40 C. The reaction time is 15 minutes to 12 hours. The resolved 5 halo compounds of formula I can be also reacted directly with a mixture of magnesium preferably as a powder having a particle size of less than one millimeter , a lower alkanol and optionally a molar excess of an aliphatic amine until naproxen is formed. This reaction is conducted at a temperature of from 0 C to the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture, preferably at least 20 C and under an inert atmosphere such as nitrogen. The time required for reduction of the 5 halo group depends upon the reaction temperature. Usually from 10 minutes to 12 hours is sufficient for this reaction. At reflux temperatures, the reaction is completed within an hour. Alternatively, the 5 halo compound of formula I is treated with Raney nickel in an inert organic solvent such as a lower alkanol, an ester having up to 6 carbon atoms such as ethyl acetate, or a lower alkanoic acid such as acetic acid, propionic acid etc., optionally under hydrogen. The reaction is carried out at a temperature of at least 0 C and preferably above 20 C for from 10 minutes to 24 hours. Reflux temperature is preferred. In a further alternative, the 5 halo compounds of formula I are treated with palladium on charcoal, platinum or platinum oxide with hydrogen in an inert organic solvent such as those described for treatment with Raney nickel. The reaction is carried out at a temperature of from 0 C up to the reflux temperature of the solvent, room temperature being preferred, for from 10 minutes to 12 hours. The crude naproxen precursor of formula I , wherein R¹ is hydrogen and n is 0 can be converted directly into naproxen. Likewise, the material can be purified by crystallization to the desired optical rotation and then converted to naproxen. The conversion to naproxen is effected by treating the naproxen precursor with a suitable methylating agent. The methylation entails the reaction of dimethylsulfate, dimethylcarbonate or a methyl halide in an alkaline medium with the naproxen precursor of formula I , i.e. the 6 hydroxy compound. As an appropriate solvent water or lower aliphatic alcohols can be used. Sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate can be used for forming the alkaline medium. The reaction is carried out at the temperature in the range of from 40 C to the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture. An optimum reaction temperature would be 40 to 70 C. The reaction time depends on the reaction temperature but, in general, the reaction is completed into 1 to 10 hours. The isolation of naproxen can be accomplished by adding a solution of an organic or inorganic strong acid to the reaction mixture which has been cooled to acidify the mixture and is filtered off. The recovered precipitate will be washed and then dried at a temperature at which naproxen is unaffected by the drying procedure. The naproxen precursor of formula I, wherein R is hydrogen, X is halogen and n is 1 can be methylated according to the above described procedure and then dehalogenated as described above. Naproxen obtained from either dehalogenation of the 5 halo compound of formula I or by methylation of the 6 hydroxy compound of formula I can be recrystallized to obtain material of very good optical rotation, i.e. with α Naproxen obtained by the method of the present invention can be converted into pharmaceutically acceptable salts by reaction of naproxen with an at least equivalent amount of organic and inorganic base preferably sodium hydroxide. This reaction is conducted in an inert solvent at a temperature between 0 and reflux temperature of the solvent and the naproxen salt is crystallized from the solvent, optionally after the removal of part or all of the solvent. Crystalline salt material can be recrystallized to increase its purity. 50 g of d,l 2 6 hydroxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid is heated in 215 ml of methanol and 13.8 ml of toluene to dissolve the d,l 2 6 hydroxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid. 67.8 g of N n octyl D glucamine is added and the solution is cooled to 40 C and seeded with crystals of the salt of d 2 6 hydroxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid with N n octyl D glucamine. The reaction mixture is stirred overnight at room temperature to give the salt of d 2 6 hydroxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid with N n octyl D glucamine which, after cleavage, affords 11.5 g of d 2 6 hydroxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid of specific rotation of 91.3 in chloroform in 23.0 yield. 10.5 g of the 6 hydroxy naproxen precursor is dissolved in 60 ml of acetone and 100 ml of a 1.5 N aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide and 44 g of methyl iodide is added to the solution. The solution is maintained at 0 20 C for 14 hours. The naproxen methyl ester obtained is hydrolyzed 17.0 g of d,l 2 6 hydroxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid and 15.34 g of N methyl D glucamine are dissolved in 150 ml of boiling methanol containing 10 ml of H₂O 10 w w . The solution is filtered to clearness and carefully cooled to 45 C with slow stirring to give the salt of the 6 hydroxy naproxen precursor with N methyl D glucamine. The salt obtained is reslurried three times from the same solvent system to afford, after cleavage, 3.1 g of d 2 6 hydroxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid of a specific rotation of 91.7 in chloroform in 18.3 yield. Following the procedure described in Example 1, d 2 6 hydroxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid is converted to d 2 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid with a specific rotation of 63.8 in chloroform. 25 g of d,l 2 5 bromo 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid, 23.7 g of N n octyl D glucamine and 60 ml of 10 toluene in methanol is brought to reflux to dissolve the crystalline materials. The reaction mixture is held at reflux for 20 minutes and then allowed to slowly cool. At 30 C, the solution is seeded with a small amount of the N n octyl D glucamine salt of d 2 5 bromo 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid. The reaction mixture is then allowed to stand overnight at room temperature. The precipitate is isolated by vacuum filtration and washed with 30 ml of cold methanol to yield 16.7 g of a material enriched in the N n octyl D glucamine salt of d 2 5 bromo 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid. A 1.0 g sample of the salt is suspended in 50 ml of water, heated to 80 C and then acidified with concentrated HCl. The resultant precipitate which is enriched in d 2 5 bromo 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid is isolated by filtration at 50 C, washed with water, and dried in a vacuum oven, α 25 D 28.2 C 0.5 in CHCl₃ . The remaining 15.7 g of the material enriched in the salt of d 2 5 bromo 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid is dissolved in 2 ml of toluene and 18 ml of methanol at the reflux temperature of the solvent. The solution is cooled to 25 C, seeded with the N n octyl D glucamine salt of d 2 5 bromo 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid and allowed to stand overnight. The precipitate is isolated by filtration and washed with 20 ml of cold methanol. The isolated material is suspended in 100 ml of water, heated to 80 C, and acidified with HCl. Isolation of the precipitate gives 5.5 g of essentially pure d 2 5 bromo 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid α 25 D 42.5 , C 0.5 in CHCl₃ . The 5 bromo naproxen precursor obtained is debrominated to yield naproxen with a specific optical rotation of 64 in chloroform, following the procedures as previously described. 15 g of d,l 2 5 bromo 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid is heated to reflux with 2.42 g of triethylamine, 7.03 g of N n octyl D glucamine and 30 ml of 10 toluene in methanol. The reaction mixture is held at reflux for 20 minutes and then allowed to slowly cool. At 30 C, the solution is seeded with a small amount of the N n octyl D glucamine salt of d 2 5 bromo 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid. The reaction is then allowed to stand overnight at room temperature. The precipitate is isolated by vacuum filtration and washed with 20 ml of cold methanol to yield 4.47 g of a material enriched in the N n octyl D glucamine salt of d 2 5 bromo 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid. The 4.47 g of the material enriched in the salt of d 2 5 bromo 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid is dissolved in 1 ml of toluene and 9 ml of methanol at the reflux temperature of the solvent. The solution is cooled to 30 C, seeded with the N n octyl D glucamine salt of d 2 5 bromo 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid and allowed to stand overnight. The precipitate is isolated by filtration and washed with 10 ml of cold methanol. The isolated material is suspended in 75 ml of water, heated to 80 C, and acidified with HCl. Isolation of the precipitate gives 1.2 g of a material substantially enriched in d 2 5 bromo 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid α 25 D 42 , C 0.5 in CHCl₃ . The 5 bromo naproxen precursor obtained is debrominated to yield naproxen following the procedures described previously. 5.30 g of d,l 2 5 chloro 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid is heated with 1.01 g of triethylamine 0.5 equivalent in 35 ml of isopropanol to about the reflux temperature of the solvent to dissolve the d,l acid. 2.09 G of N ethyl D glucamine 0.5 equivalent are added and the solution is cooled to room temperature i.e. about 20 23 C to give 4 g of a material enriched in the salt of the less soluble naproxen precursor acid with N ethyl D glucamine. A sample of the latter is dissolved in about 25 ml of water heated to about 80 C, treated with hydrochloric acid until acidic at which time a material enriched in the naproxen precursor acid precipitates out of solution and is recovered by filtration. 1.00 g of the material enriched in the N ethyl D glucamine salt is dissolved in 19.5 ml of isopropanol and 1.5 ml of water at about the reflux temperature of the solvent. The solution is cooled to room temperature to give 0.50 g of a recrystallized salt. This material is treated with hydrochloric acid as set forth above in the preceding paragraph to give a material further enriched in the naproxen precursor acid. A solution of 1 g of d 2 5 chloro 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid in 20 ml of 10 aqueous sodium hydroxide solution at 90 C is treated with 3 g of a nickel aluminum alloy in small portions. After stirring the mixture for two hours, it is filtered, diluted with excess diluted hydrochloric acid and extracted with methylene chloride. The organic phase is evaporated to dryness and the residue recrystallized from methylene chloride hexane to yield 2 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid α Repeating the above procedure with the corresponding 5 bromo compound yields naproxen of an α 6.2 g of d,l 2 5 bromo 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid is heated with 1.01 g of triethylamine 0.5 equivalent in 30 ml of isopropanol and 1.5 ml of water to about the reflux temperature of the solvent to dissolve the d,l acid. 2.09 g of N ethyl D glucamine are added and the solution is cooled to room temperature to give 4.32 g of a material enriched in the N ethyl D glucamine salt. A sample of the latter is dissolved in about 25 ml of water heated to about 80 C, treated with hydrochloric acid until acidic at which time a material enriched in the naproxen precursor acid precipitates out of solution and is recovered by filtration. 1.00 g of the material enriched in the N ethyl D glucamine salt is dissolved in 20 ml of 5 aqueous isopropanol and 1.0 ml of water at about the reflux temperature of the solvent. The solution is cooled to room temperature to give 0.6 g of a first recrystallized material. A sample of the latter is treated with hydrochloric acid as set forth in the preceding paragraph to give a material further enriched in the naproxen precursor salt. 0.50 g of the first recrystallized material from the preceding paragraph is dissolved in 10 ml of 5 aqueous isopropanol and 0.5 ml of water at about the reflux temperature of the solvent. The solution is cooled to room temperature to give 0.43 g of a second recrystallized material. A sample of the latter is treated with hydrochloric acid as set forth in the first paragraph of this Example to give a material even further optically enriched. 0.33 g of the second recrystallized material from the preceding paragraph is dissolved in 12 ml of 5 aqueous isopropanol and 1.0 ml of water at about the reflux temperature of the solvent. The solution is cooled to room temperature to give 0.27 g of a third recrystallized material. The latter is treated with hydrochloric acid as set forth in the first paragraph of this Example to give substantially pure 5 bromo naproxen precursor. To a 250 ml flask equipped with a reflux condenser and a nitrogen bubbler magnesium powder 60 g are added, further anhydrous methanol 50 ml and triethylamine 10 g . The flask is swept with nitrogen, and the nitrogen atmosphere is maintained throughout the reaction. The 5 bromo naproxen precursor 0.1 mole in methanol 15 g is slowly added, and the mixture is heated under reflux for one additional hour after the addition of the 5 bromo naproxen precursor is complete. The cooled mixture is mixed with 6 Repeating this procedure with the corresponding 5 chloro naproxen precursor naproxen is obtained with a specific optical rotation of 62 in chloroform. 3 g of d,l 2 5 chloro 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid is heated with 0.50 g of triethylamine 0.5 equivalent in 15 ml of isopropanol and 0.5 ml of water to about the reflux temperature of the solvent to dissolve the propionic acid. There is an immediate precipitate when 1.32 g of N cyclohexyl D glucamine 0.5 equivalent is added to the heated solution.
