# Motor speed control arrangement.

## Abstract
A variable motor speed control arrangement of the tachogenerator feedback loop type, in which the firing angle, in each half cycle of an a.c. mains supply, of a triac 5 in series with the motor M is varied to provide the required control employs a single cycling counter CT to time the interval between two output pulses of the tachogenerator T in order to determine the current motor speed and also to provide a count down from the beginning of each half cycle to the required firing instant. The control processes are carried out in periods beginning at each counter overflow instant. This breaking up of the processing together wih the use of the single counter enables a microcomputer 1 which is running other programmes to be able to provide the speed control in addition.
