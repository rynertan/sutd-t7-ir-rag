# Method for producing silica.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a method for purifying silica waste obtained in the manufacture of aluminium fluoride from hexafluosilicic acid and aluminium hydroxide, whereby the silica, is subjected to an acidic leaching at a pH below 3 to leach out part of the fluorine and substantially all the aluminium present in said waste, and is thereafter subjected to an alkaline leaching at pH 8.5 11.5 to leach out remaining fluorine present in said waste. The leachings are preferably carried out at elevated temperatures, normally 60 90 C, and for a time sufficient to considerably reduce the contents of aluminium and fluorine, normally 1 3 hrs. The silica obtained is highly redctive and can be used as such or transformed into sodium slicate by a reaction with sodium hydroxide. The contents of fluorine and aluminium transferred to a process for the production of cryolite or similar compounds.
