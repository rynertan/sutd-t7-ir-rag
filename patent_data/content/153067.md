# DIENE POLYMERS AND PROCESS FOR PRODUCING THE SAME

## Abstract
Diene polymers are prepared by polymerizing a conjugated diene in an organic solvent solution of an active lithium termi nated polymer in the presence of A a cobalt compound and B carbon disulphide and or phenylisothiocyanic acid, said diene polymer comprising a 1,2 polybutadiene portion comprising 70 by weight or more of 1,2 units.
