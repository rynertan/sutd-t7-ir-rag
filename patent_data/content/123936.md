# Semiconductor device.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a semiconductor device, especially MIS FET, which can ensure high breakdown voltage and operate at high speed. The source and drain regions 5, 6 24, 25 have an impurity concentration not exceeding 10²⁰ cm ³, and on the surface of the impurity regions there is a metal silicide layer 12, 214 with a very thin, highly conductive layer 13 formed underneath the silicide. In the case of CMOS, the impurity concentration of the n type drain or source regions 24, 25 does not exceed 10²⁰ cm ³ whereas the impurity concentration of an p type drain or source regions does not exceed 10¹⁹ cm ³ and at least one portion 214 of the drain or source region 24, 25 is made of a metal silicide, thereby effectively preventing the latch up phenomenon. The characteristics of the MISFET may be further improved by having a gate sidewall insulator of a high dielectric constant.
