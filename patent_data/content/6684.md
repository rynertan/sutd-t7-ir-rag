## Description
DESCRIPTION POLYMERIC COMPOSITION HAVING ENHANCED RESISTANCE TO PHOTODEGRADATION The present invention concerns a polymeric conposition waving enhanced resistance to photodegradation. Polymers have in the past and continue to provide an attractive substitute for other nore traditional types of structural materials e.g., wood and metals because of relatively inexpensive materials and fabrication costs.As polymers continue to find new applications in, for example, the fabrication of automotive parts and building materials, they must also become more durable and capable of withsvanding prolonged exposure to a variety of degradative forces. Degradation of polymers can be caused by exposure to light, heat and or air. Such degradation is usually manifest by either a partial or total loss of structura integrity, changes in light transmission properties, changes in color, loss or reduction in flexibility and or resiliency, or any combination of the above phenomenon.Those attempting to avoid polymer degradation have generally selected from among three possible approaches a elimination or reduction of the degradative forces b isolation of the sensitive polymer material from the degradative forces or c modification of the polymer composition to enhance its resistance to degradative forces. The latter approach is generally preferable since it does not require engineering or structural change in the polymer product environment. There are a variety of additives which have been disclosed as suitable for enhancing the resistance of polymers to one or more of the degradative forces discussed hereinabove. These additives hereinafter referred to as stabilizers can be physically combined wit or engrafted upon the envirommentally sensitive polymer, thereby prolong ing its useful life in the hostile degradative envirormtent. Stabilizers are available which can nance the polymers resistance to more than one of the degradative forces and conversely, a stabilizer which is effective for prevention of, for example, oxidative degradation may have little if any effect upon the polymers resistance to other degradative agents. Thus, it is not uncommon for polymers to contain a variety of stabilizer materials, each being present for the prevention cf the particular degradative reaction. One of the more difficult to control of the degradative forces is irradiation of the polymer by ultraviolet light. The impact of such irradiation will of course vary depending upon the intensity and duration of exposure and thus may manifest itself only after a prolonged interval.The irradiation of polymers with ultraviolet light can often times cause cross linking of these materials thereby reducing their resiliency and or impact resistance. Changes in color and opacity are also often affected by prolonged exposure of the polymer to ultraviolet light. While many materials are known, and commercially available, as stabilizers against ultraviolet light degradation, the degree of protection afforded by such agents is often concentration dependent.The following list of references are illustrative of the types of ultraviolet absorbers commonly used in conjunction with polymeric materials sensitive to photodegradation U.S.Patent Nos. 3,362,929 3.362,930 3,829,292 3,901,849 3,910,918 3,939,164 UKPatent999s806 and an article appearing in J. Am. Chem. Soc., Vol. 60 1458 et seq. 1938 .In addition, commonly assigned U.S. patent applicationsSerial No. 697,345 and 697,387 both filed on Juno 18, 1976 disclose compounds which are highly effective as ultraviolet light stabilizers for polymeric materials. The compounds disclosed in the above referenced pending patent applications are substituted decahydroquinolines. Such compounds are highly effective in enhancing the resistance of polyolefins to photodegradation by s violet light. As will be readily apprceiated, the addition of substantial amounts in excess of 10 weight percent of stabilizer materials to a polymer can of tun modify its intrinsic physical, chemical and or electrical properties or the intrinsic properties of articles prepared therefrom. Thus, there is a continuing need for highly efficient ultraviolet light stabilizer compounds and compositions which are protective of polymers at low concentrations e.g.10 weight percent or less. According to the present invention a composition is provided comprising a polymer which is sensitive to ultraviolet light and, in an amount sufficient to enhance the resistance of the polymer to photodegradation, a mixture containing at least onesubstituteddecahydroquino line functional polymer of the formulaEMI3.1 wherein Ra, Rb, and Rc are independently selected from alkyl groups containing 1 to 12 carbon atoms, a cyclohexyl group, or cyclohexylalkyl groups containing 7 to 14 carbon atoms A is selected from the group consisting of alkyl groups containing 1 to 18 carbon atoms, alkoxy groups containing 1 to 12 carbon atoms in the group, ester groups containing a total of from 2 to 2ss carbon atoms in the group, a cyclohexyl group, cyclohexylalkyl groups containing 7 to 14 carbon atoms in the group, hydroxy groups, amino groups and aminoalkyl groups and alkyl substituted amino and aminsalkyl groups wherein the alkyl contains 1 to 12 carbon atoms Z is a se ent of the polymer backbone derived from an oletinic monomer x is 0, 1, 2 or 3 and B is hydrogen, an alkyl group containing 1 to 12 carbon atoms, a cyclohexyl group, or a cyclohexylalkyl group of 7 to 14 carbon atoms in the group and m is at least 2 and at least one 1w absorbing compound selected from the group consisting of benzotriazoles, benzoates and nickel phenolate complexes. The polymer of the stabilizer mixture can be present in the com position as a physically distinct entity or chemically bonded to the ultraviolet light sensitive polymer. In one of the preferred embodiments of this invention, the polymer of the stabilizer mixture is chemically en grafted upon the ultraviolet light sensitive polymer. In another of the preferred embodi ments of this invention, the polymer of the stabilizer mixture is present in the composi ition as a copolymer that is prepared by copolymerization with an ultraviolet light sensitive monomer or with monomers which are relatively insensitive to photodegrad ation by ultraviolet light e.g. 4 vinyl pyridine or N vinylcarbazole . By means of the present invention it is possible to remedy the deficiencies referred to above as well as related deficiencies in the prior art and to provide a composition having enhanced resistance to photodegradation from ultraviolet light while containing only a few concentrations of stabilizer thus prolonging the useful life or the composition in a deDradative environment. The compositions of this invention can be readily prepared for exarsple by simply mixing a polymer which is sensitive to ultraviolet light degradation and the stabilizer mixture under conditions designed for uniform distribution Of the mixture throughout the polymer. trdin arily, the concentration of stabilizer mixture in the polymer will range from about 0.05 parts by weight stabilizer mixture per one hundred parts by weight ultraviolet light sensitive polymer to about 5 parts by weight stabilizer mixture per one hundred parts by weight ultraviolet light sensitive polymer.The preferred content of stabilizer mixture in the polymer compositions of this invention is typically in the range of from about 0.1 parts by weight stabilizer mixture per one hundred parts ultraviolet light sensitive polymer to about 1 part by weight stabilizer mixture per one hundred parts by weight ultraviolet light sensitive polymer. Virtually all polymeric materials are sensitive,at least to some degree, to photodegradation by ultraviolet light. The term photodegradation is used throughout this disclosure in reference to ultraviolet light sensitive polymers to describe any photo induced changes in the physical, chemical, and or electrical properties caused by such irradiation. Such degradative changes may, for example, involve cross linking of the polymer, dehydrohalogenation, reduction in chain length, or photo oxidation.Polymers which are especially sensitive to ultraviolet light degradation are materials which contain unsaturation along their respective backbone, vinyl halide polymers, polyolef i lS, polyacetaldehydes, polyurethanes, ABS resins, polystyrene, polyacrylonitrile, polycarbonates, polyacrylates, poly a substituted acrylates, varnish, phenol formaldehyde resins, polyepoxides, polyesters, and their respective blends and copolymers. The preferred ultraviolet light sensitive polymers of the composition of this invention are poly a monoolefins. Examples of alpha monoolefin monomers used in the preparation of the latter polymers are ethylene, propylene, isobuty lent, 1 butene, 1 pentene, 1 hexene and 4 methyl 1 pentene, The stabilizer mixture disclosed herein is especially suitable for use in the retardation of photodegradation of polypropylene. The polymers of the formula I given above can be prepared for example by a variety of methods disclosed in the open literature. One especially satisfactory technique for the preparation of the corresponding monomer comprises amulti stepprocess involving first the condensation reaction of an aromatic amine, for example aniline, or a ring substituted aniline with a ketone, or mixture of ketones, to prepare the dihydroquinoline.This intermediate is then hydrogenated in the presence of a metal catalyst to yield the decahydroquinoline Literature preparations for the above compound are also disclosed in U.S. Patent Nows. 3,829,292 and 3,910,918 and in J.Am.Chem.Soc., Vol. 60 1938 at pages 1458 et seq. Dihydroquinoline dimers can also be prepared according to the same general reaction scheme. A process for hydrogenation of the dihydroquinoline to yield the decahydroquinoline is disclosed inU.S. PatentNos. 2,831,861 and 2,998,468. The decahydroquinoline compounds thus prepared can thereafter be reacted at the N position with a variety of monomers, or groups which are capable of forming monomers or groups which are reactive toward chain propagating agents.Polymers corresponding to formula I are the subject of a copending commonly assigned U.S. patent application Serial No. 850,994 filed November 14, 1977 in the names of Robert Wesley Layer and Pyong Nae So.

One such representative preparation is disclosed inU.S. Patent 3,975,358, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The compositions of this invention can contain, in addition to the materials described hereinabove, a variety of optional in redients. Such ingredients are, for example metal oxides, e.O. zinc, calcium or magnesium oxide, fatty acids e.g. stearic, lauric acid or a metal salt thereof fillers e.g. calcium or magnesium carbonate, calcium or barium sulfonate, alvnini Wa silicate or asbestos plasticizers and extenders, for example a dialkyl or diarhl organic acid, e.g. diisobutyl, diisooctyl, diisodecyl or dibenzyl oleate, stearate, sebacate, azelate or phthalate ASTti Type 2 petroleum oils, paraffinic oils, castor oil, tall oil or glycerine antioxidants, e.g. 2,5 di t butyl paracresol, 2,2 methylene bis 4 ethyl 6 Q butyl phenol , 2,2 thio bis 4 methyl 6 t butyl phenol , 2,2 methylene bis 6 tbutyl 4 ethyl phenol, 4,4 butylidene bis 6 t butyl m cresol, 2 4 hydroxy 3,5 di t butylanilino 4,6 bis octylthio l,3,5 triazine, hexahydro 1,3,5 tris ss 3,5 di t butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propionyl s triazine, tris 3,5t butyl 4 hydroxybenzyl isocyanurate, tetrakismethyLene 3 3 ,5 di t butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propionate methane, distearyl hiodipropionate, dilaurylthiodipropionate, tri nonylphenyl phosphite or tinthioglycolate and other ingredients for example pigments, tackifiers, flame retardants or fungicides.

The combination of the W stabilizer mixture and a phenolic antioxidant is especially suitable for stabilization of polyolefin polymers especially stabilizaticn against degradation by heat, oxygen and ultraviolet light. Ordinarily, the ultraviolet light sensitive polymer is compoimded with the various types of stabilizer materials in accord with standard mixing techniques and equipment for example inaBanbury mixer, a flenschei nixer, a rubber mill, an extruder mixer or equivalent device. The various components of the composition may be physically intimately blended either in the absence of or in the presence of a common solvent or in a solvent which is capable of dissolving the polymer component of the composition yet substantially incapable of dissolving the stabilizer ingredients.Typical of such solvent dispersing agents are hexane and benzene. subsequent to intimately dispersing the various components of the composition within one another, the dispersing agent if any can be removed by selective evaporation and the resultant resin recovered.The resin may thereafter be formed into usable products by a variety of standard techniques. The ultraviolet light stability of the compositions of this invention is evaluated by exposIng a sample of the composition to an Xenon or carbon are light in aWeather Ometer available from Atlas Electric Devices Co.,Chicago, Illinois operating at temperatures of about 600C.Degradation of the sample is monitored periodically by measuring the carbonyl adsorption band at 1720 cm 1 using an IR spectrophotometer. The relatively rapid formation of carbonyl sites indicates photodegradation of the sample. This test procedure is an accepted method for evaluation of the efficacy of such W stabilizers and is fully described in the literature, see l Ph.otodegrada tion, Photooxidation and Photostabilization of Polymers by Ranby and Raybeck, John Wiley and Sons, New York City 1975 at page 125 et seq., and is also disclosed in U.S.Patent No. 3,909,493. Photodegradation of the sample can also be manifest hy visual cracking of the sample when heated to about 1800 C. Oxidative degradation and thermal stability of the sample can also be verified by monitoring the time required to effect discoloration and or embrittlement of the sample in an ageing oven maintained at 1400 C. EVALUATION PROCEDURE A series of films were prepared 20 mils thick from polypropylene Profax 6501, available from HerculesInc., Wilmington, Delaware and 1 Tinuvin 328 2 3 ,5 di t amyl 2 hydroxyphenyl benzotriazole , a known W stabilizer available from Ciba Geigy 2 a substituted decahydroquinoline polymer 3 a mixture of Tinuvin 328 and substituted decahydroquinoline polymer and 4 devoid of any stabilizing agent. The above films were prepared by dry blending the polypropylene and stabilizer in the appropriate relative proportions followed by melt blend of the resultant sample in a Brabender extruder operated at 4500F 23200 and 75 RPM. Films were prepared from the extruded material by placing a measured amount of the composition between parallel aluminum plates which were maintained at 4200F 232 C . The plates were then brought other thereby compressing the sample. The duration of the molding cycle is approximately three minutes and the pressure applied during the cycle is 20,000 psig. Heating is continued for only 1 3 of the compression cycle. A four minute cool don period isallowedprior to separation of the aluminium plates. The molded sheet thus obtained is in the range of 10 to 20 mils thick. This sheet is stripped from the aluminum plates and cut into strips approximately 1 x 2 and mounted for subsequent testing in an Atlas Model 60 WWeather Ometer. The Weather Ometer is operated at 140 150 F 60 C to 66 C . The sample, upon being placed within this device, was subjected to an Xenon light source and the ultraviolet light degradation thereof plotted by monitoring the infrared absorption band of the sample at 1720 cm 1 this band corresponding to carbonyl group formation . A Perkin Elmer Hodel 467IR spectrophotometer was used to monitor carbonyl group formation.

The residue remaining in the flask was taken up with methanol and the desired product isolated by centrifugation. A total of 9.2 grams pale yellow solids were obtained. The pale yellow solid was subjected to NMR spectro analysis. The results of such evaluation indicate that the product contained 42.2 mole percent of 2,2,4trimethyldecahydroquinoline groups, and 57.8 mole percent benzophenone functional groups. Elemental analysis showed 67.28 carbon, 7.42 hydrogen and 1.50 nitrogen. EXAMPLE V Preparation of copolymers from acrylonitrile and N 2 methylacryloxyethyl 2,2,4 trimethyldecahydroquinoline. Following essentially the same procedure as described in Example IV, 0.1 mole of N 2 methacryloxyethyl 2,2,4 trimethyldecahydroquinoline was reacted with 0.1 mole of acrylonitrile in the Presence of 0.4 gram ofAIBN and 120 mls of 2 propanol. The 2 propanol used as the polymerization medium is degassed with nitrogen prior to initiation of the polymerization. The reaction mixture was stirred and heated gradually to reflux and the reaction allowed to continue overnight. Two separate layers were formed within the reaction vessel. The upper layer was removed by decantation and then ethanol was added to the lower layer, thereby forming a precipitate. The precipitated material was washed twice with alcohol and dried in a vacuum oven. The dried solid was ground and sieved through 60 mesh screening. The off white powder thus recovered, approximately 17.3 grams had a melting point in the range of 104 1140C. and was insoluble in dimethylsulfoxide DM50 . EXAMPLE VI Preparation of copolymer from N 2 methacryloxy ethyl 2,2, 4 trimethyldecahydroquinollne and 2 hydroxy 4 2 hydroxy 3 methacryloxy propoxybenzophenone.

The reaction mixture was gradually heated to reflux and allowed to react overnight. The resulting mixture was titrated with hexane thereby forming a solid material. The solids thus formed are ground in a mortar and pestle and thereafter separated from hexane by filtration. The recovered solids are dried in a vacuum oven, ground and sieved through a number 60 mesh screen. The solids thus recovered weighed approximately 22.6 grams and had a softening point of about 1140C. Elemental analysis of the polymeric sample revealed 70.4 C and 8.18 H, and 2.23 N.Further extraction of the reaction medium with acetone followed by hexane yielded additional copolymer. Infrared spectral analysis confirmed the subsequently recovered materials to be identical to that originally obtained.
