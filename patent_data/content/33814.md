# ELECTRICAL CONNECTOR INCLUDING SURGE PROTECTION FOR A PLURALITY OF CIRCUITS AND METHOD OF MAKING SAME

## Abstract
Electrical connector including surge protection for a plurality of circuits, this connector 10 having a plurality of electrical contacts 300 extending through a connector shell 100 and mounted by insulating members 210, 220 to the shell 100 , the insulating members 210, 220 defining a sealed chamber 500 within an intermediate portion of the shell 100 a ground plane 400 is mounted to the shell 100 within the sealed chamber 500 and includes a plurality of apertures 410 , each aperture 410 receiving a contact 300 Therethrough with the contact 300 being smaller than the aperture 410 to provide a spacing 415 between the contact 300 and the ground plane aperture 410 , the spacing 415 and the sealed chamber 500 being filled with a low pressure inert gas having a small amount of ionizable gas in re sponse to an electrical potential surge on the contact 300 e.g., from lightning , the ionizable gas breaks down and allows a arc to pass between the contact 300 and the ground plane 400 to thereby dissipate electrical energy of said electrical potential surge.
