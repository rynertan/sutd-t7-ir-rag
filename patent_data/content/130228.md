## Description
FERMENTATION METHOD USING A SELECTED LACTOBACILLUSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a method for fermenting foods using selected cultures of a lactobacillus having the rapid low temperature fermentation characteristics of Lactoacillus casei subspecies alactosusNRRL B 12,344 or tactobacillus casei NRRL B 15,438 usually at food temperatures of between 15.60C 600F and 26.70C 80 F in the presence of an effective amount of a stimulatory, food grade metal salt, preferably a manganese salt. Fermentation temperatures in the range between about 15.60C 600F and 48.90C 1200F can be used however, lower temperatures than 26.70C 800F are preferred, particularly to reduce the risk of significantStaphylococcus aureus growth in fermented meats.Prior Art The prior art has generally described meat fermentation methods using many different cultures of lactobacilli which generate lactic acid from dextrose, lactose, glycogen, sucrose and or starch in foods. U.S.Patent Nos. 2,225,783 and 3,193,391 to Jensen et al 3,098,744 to Von Lorch et al 3,814,817 to Everson et al and 3,561,977 and 3,910,664 to Rothchild et al are representative of this prior art which is extensive. In this prior art, various strains of lactobacilli are described as useful for fermenting foods however, these cultures have the characteristic of fermenting lactose, starch and glycogen which, when present in uncontrolled or unknown amounts in a meat mixture to be fermented, can result in the production of excessive amounts of lactic acid causing an undesirable low final pH in the fermented meat. It is generally true of lactobacilli and specifically most strains of Lactobacillus casei that sausage fermentations proceed very slowly or not at all at temperatures less than 26.70C 800F . Commercially meat fermentations are usually conducted above 26.70C 800F for this reason. Usually semi dry sausage is prepared by fermenting a carbohydrate particularly dextrose and or naturally occurring glycogen in meat in less than about 30 hours. Dry sausage is usually fermented over a period of at least two to three days. Both methods preferably involve a rapid initial fermentation which produces lactic acid in the meat thereby lowering the pH. Once the pH is lowered to the desired level any further lowering of the pH makes the product unacceptable. This can particularly occur during the drying period required to make dry sausage. In general, the prior art strains of lactobacilli used for making sausage to develop a pH of less than about 5.0 in about 30 hours or less, require fermentation at an elevated temperature range between about 26.6bC to 450C 800F to 1130F , These lactobacilli are too slow at lower meat temperatures between about 10 C to 26.70 500F to 800F since they take much longer to develop a pH of less than about 5.0. In U.S. patent No. 4,303,679 the use of manganese salts in the fermentation of meats using specific unique strains of Pediococcus pentosaceus is described.U.S patent No. 2,945,766 to Chiat generally describes the use of manganese salts in meat fermentations with lactobacilli at temperatures at or above 26,7 C 800F . Hanna, M. O., et al Journal of Food ProtectionVol 43 pages 837 841 describe the use of Lactobacillus casei subspecies alactosus in vacuum packed meat at 1 to 30C for preservation without fermentation. These cultures were not effective and detracted from the taste of the meat. Objects It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method for producing fermented foods using selected cultures of a lactobacillus similar toLactobacillus casei subsp. alactosus NRRL B 12,344 orLactobacillus casei NRRL B 15,438 with a stimulatory metal salt which cultures ferment rapidly at low temperatures.It is particularly an object of the present invention to provide a method wherein fermented meats can be produced using the selected lactobacillus similar to Lactobacillus casei subsp. alactosus NRRL B 12,344 or Lactobacillus caseiNRRL B 15,438 and stimulatory metal salt wherein the meat mixture to be fermented contains unknown or uncontrolled amounts of certain carbohydrates. These and other objects will become increasingly apparent from the following description.General Description The present invention relates to the improvement in a food fermentation method including the steps of providing lactic acid producing bacteria in the food with an assimilable carbohydrate and then fermenting the food with the bacteria so that lactic acid is produced from the carbohydrate over a period of time in the food which comprises providing in admixture in a food a culture of a lactobacillus with an assimilable carbohydrate and with a stimuldtory, food grade metal salt in an amount sufficient to accelerate the fermentation by the lactobacillus, wherein the culture is characterized by having low temperature fermentation characteristics in food at least as rapid as Lactobacillus casei subspecies alactosusNRRL B 12,344 or Lactobacillus casei NRRL B 15,438 and fermenting the food admixture at temperatures between about 15.60C and 48.90C so that lactic acid is produced in the food product.Using Lactobacillus casei subsp. alactosusNRRL B 12,344 or Lactobacillus casei NRRL B 15,438 at a concentration of 3.6 x 107 cells per grams of meat, a pH of 5.0 usually can be achieved at 240C in less than about 24 hours with an initial food pH of about 5.9 without the metal salt. With the metal salt, the fermentation time is significantly decreased under equivalent conditions. The present invention particularly relates to the meat fermentation method including the steps of providing lactic acid producing bacteria in the meat with an assimilable sugar and then fermenting the meat with the bacteria so that lactic acid is produced from the sugar over a period of time in the fermented meat wherein the improvement comprises providing in admixture in meat a culture of a lactobacillus having low temperature meat fermentation characteristics at least as rapid asLactobacillus casei subspecies alactosus NRRL B 12,344 orLactobacillus casei NRRL B 15,438 at a concentration of between about 105 and 109 of the lactobacillus per gram of meat with an assimilable carbohydrate and with a stimulatory food grade manganese salt in an amount sufficient to stimulate the growth of the lactobacillus wherein the lactobacillus culture is characterized by an ability to rapidly ferment in the meat admixture at meat temperatures of about 240C to produce a pH of about 5 or less and fermenting the meat admixture at smokehouse temperatures between about 15.60C and 48.90C so that lactic acid is produced in the fermented meat product. The present invention further relates to a culture of lactobacillus adapted for meat fermentations including an assimilable carbohydrate at smokehouse temperatures between about 15.60C and 48.90C which comprises a selected lactobacillus grown in growth medium including assimilable sources of carbon, nitrogen and inorganic substances to a concentration of at least about 1 x 107 of the lactobacillus per ml, having a pB between about 4 and 8 and containing a stimulatory food grade metal salt after growth in an amount sufficient to accelerate the fermentation in the meat by providing a concentration of metal ion between about 0.01 ppm and 1500 ppm in the meat, wherein the selected lactobacillus culture is characterized by an ability to rapidly ferment in a meat admixture with an assimilable sugar at temperatures of about 240C to produce a pH less than about 5 at least as rapidly asLactobacillus casei subsp. alactosus NRRL B 12,344 orLactobacillus casei NRRL B 15,438. By a process which involves selective testing or genetic manipulation, lactobacillus having similar low temperature fermentation characteristics can be found or produced. Examples 1 and 2 show Lactobacillus casei subspecies alactosus NRRL B 12,344. Examples 5, 6 and 7 show Lactobacillus casei NRRL B 15,438. In some instances the selected lactobacillus may not be of the same strain or the same species. All of this is well known to those skilled in the art. The lactobacillus cells can be used as a concentrate having a pH between about 4 and 8 containing at least about 1 x 107 cells per gram up to about 1015 cells per gram, usually between about 1 x 109 and 1012 cells per gram, mixed with the stimulatory metal salt, preferably a manganese salt. The concentrates are prepared by centrifugation by reverse osmosis, by ultrafiltration, or by dialysis of the cells in the growth medium, all of which are well known to those skilled in the art. The concentrates containing the stimulatory metal salt can be frozen with or without a freezing stabilizing agent such as monosodium glutamate, malt extract, non fat dry milk, alkali metal glycerophosphate, glutamic acid, cystine, glycerol, or dextran or the like and then thawed for use or the concentrates can be lyophilized to a powder as is well known to those skilled in the art.The bacterial cells are used in a range between about 105 to 109 cells per gram of meat. The stimulatory metal salt is used in an amount of metal cation in the salt above about 0.01 parts per million to about 1500 parts per million by weight of the food to be fermented, preferably between about 0.1 and 100 ppm. The metal salt must be food grade. Such salts include for instance manganese chloride, manganese sulfate, manganese citrate, manganese glycerophosphate, manganese oxide and manganese gluconate and various non toxic metal salts of acids which are at least slightly soluble in water. Other metal salts include ferrous,, ferric, magnesium, calcium, zinc salts however, none are as effective as manganese. The metal salt can be incorporated into the bacterial culture in an amount between about 0.01 and 50 percent by weight of the culture in order to provide the required amount of the metal salt needed in the food when the culture is added. The low temperature lactobacillus, particularlyLactobacillus casei NRRL B 12,344 or Lactobacillus caseiNRRL B 15,438, admixed with the stimulatory metal salt causes nitrite reduction due to the lowering of the pH of the meat in fermented meats, particularly pork including bacon and ham at a pH of between about 5 and 6 and at a concentration of bacteria between about 105 and 1010 cells per ml. Usually the bacteria are included in the aqueous pickling solution and added to the meat as a spray or injected in an amount up to 15 by weight of the meat.Bacon is usually not reduced to a pH less than about 6 from an initial pH of 6.3 to 6.4. The lactobacillus with a stimulatory metal salt can lower the pH thus causing the nitrite reduction at lower temperatures than can be achieved in the absence of the stimulatory metal salt.Specific Description The Lactobacillus casei subsp. alactosus strain of the present invention has been deposited at the NorthernRegional Research Laboratory of the USDA, Peoria, Illinois and was designated as NRRL B 12,344. NRRL B 12,344 or a lactobacillus which has substantially the same low temperature meat fermentation characteristics is used in the present invention. The essential identification characteristics of this strain and related strains are shown in Table I.

NRRL B 12,344 produces primarily L lactic acid. Acid but no gas from glucose.Acid and gas are produced from gluconate. Lactobacillus casei subspecies alactosus has been used without a stimulatory metal salt at elevated temperatures above 26.70C 800F in mixed bacterial cultures with other lactic acid producing bacteria which broadly ferment most carbohydrates. Example 1 The preparation of a bacterial concentrate is described in this Example. Lactobacillus casei subspecies alactosus NRRL B 12,344 was grown in a growth medium such as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,561,977 and 3,960,664.The medium includes a carbohydrate glucose or other assimilable sugar a nitrogen source yeast extract or other source of amino acids and traces of essential minerals or inorganic substances usually including a manganese salt manganese sulfate monohydrate . The pH of the medium was initially adjusted to between 6.5 to 6.7 and the fermenter was set to maintain a pH of 6.0 during growth by the intermittent addition of ammonia. NRRL B 12,344 was grown at 350C for about 15 hours. The bacteria were then concentrated using a centrifuge and, where the concentrate was not to be used immediately, were mixed with glycerin as a freezing stabilizing agent 10 by weight and frozen for storage. The concentrates were also mixed with the manganese sulfate monohydrate as indicated in the followingExamples prior to freezing. Example 2 The Lactobacillus casei subspecies alactosusNRRL B 12,344 culture of Example 1 prior to centrifugation contained 8 x 109 cells per milliliter in the growth medium.The culture was centrifuged and then resuspended at the rate of 5 milliliters of supernatant liquid per 100 ml of original culture. One milliliter 1 ml of this concentrate was diluted with 20.3 milliliters of tap water and was inoculated at a rate of 4.5 milliliters of diluted culture per 0.93 kg 2.5 pounds of sausage mix 40 pork and 60 beef with 3.0 salt, 1.0 dextrose, spices and û.0156 sodium nitrite which supplied about 3 x 107 cells per gram of the sausage mix. Lactobacillus casei subspecies alactosus NRRL B 12,344 was tested with no metal ion, with calcium chloride and with manganese sulfate monohydrate in an amount of 13 parts per million of the metal cation based upon the weight of the sausage.Procedure 1 The meat was comminuted to the selected size. 2 The dextrose, salt, spice mix, metal salt and sodium nitrite were added to the comminuted meat and mixed. 3 The sausage mix was divided into aliquots and inoculated with appropriate cultures and mixed thoroughly. 4 The sausage mix was stuffed into 53 mm diameter fibrous casings using a hydraulic stuffer. 5 The sausages were fermented at 240C 75.20F dry bulb and 210C 69.8 Ft wet bulb 80 room humidity using a controlled environment chamber.Determination of pH 1 The pH of the sausage was determined at various times. 2 Thirty grams of sausage were blended with 90 ml distilled water for 30 to 60 seconds. The pH of the slurry was determined. Prior to each pB reading, the pB meter was calibrated against two standard buffers pH values of 7.00 and 4.01 .

At this level, it cannot be said that calcium is significantly stimulatory. Comparative Example 3 Example 2 was repeated at 13 ppm metal ion concentration except that Lactobacillus lactis, Farr NRRL B 5628 and Lactobacillus plantarum NRRL B 5461 as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,984,575 and 3,814,817 were used at 240C 75 20F .

Example 5 The preparation of a frozen concentrate ofNRRL B 15,438 was described in a laboratory fermentor as described in Example 1. The sausage mixture and procedure were as described in Example 2, except that only pork was used for the sausage meat mixture. The meat mixture was inoculated at a rate to deliver 1.8 x 107 NRRL B 15,438 cells per gram of the sausage mix. Lactobacillus casei NRRL B 15,438 was tested with no metal ion and with manganese sulfate monohydrate in an amount of 4 parts per million of the metal cation based upon the weight of the sausage. The sausage mix was stuffed into 44 mm diameter fibrous casings using a hydraulic stuffer. The sausage were fermented at 240C 75.20F wet bulb and 250C 770F dry bulb 92 relative humidity using a controlled environment chamber.Results The results are shown in Table VI.

Thus, usually 3.6 x 107 cells per gram of meat is the inoculation rate. The data in Table VI is with an inoculation rate of 1.8 x 107 cells per gram of meat. It is still relatively fast at lower temperatures. Example 6 Sausages were prepared as in Example 5 and were inoculated with production fermenter produced Lactobacillus casei NRRL B 15,438 or with a commercial preparation ofPediococcus pentosaceus NRRL B 11,465 to compare fermentation speed and color development at 240C 75.20F wet bulb temperature. Both sausages contained manganese sulfate monohydrate in an amount of 4 parts per million of the metal cation based on the weight of the sausage. Pediococcus NRRL B 11,465 was added at a rate to deliver 3.6 x 107 cells per gram of meat and Lactobacillus casei NRRL B 15,438 was added at a rate to deliver 1.8 x 107 cells per gram of meat.
