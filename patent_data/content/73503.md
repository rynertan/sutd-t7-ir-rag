# Control system for synchronous brushless motors.

## Abstract
A motor control system wherein the motor windings are energized by sinusoidal excitation currents synthesized from prerecorded sine values. The frequency of the winding exci tation currents is synchronous with the rotor movement and the phase is a function of the rotor position with respect to the stator. The phase of the winding excitation is additionally con trollable as a function of speed or some other adequate sys tem parameter. It has further been found that the total opera tional speed range of the system is substantially increased by further adjusting and controlling the phase of the excitation currents as a function of the desired speed.
