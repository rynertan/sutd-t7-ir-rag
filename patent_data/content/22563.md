# Displacement control valve for a radial piston device.

## Abstract
A radial piston device such as a radial piston motor 10 has a rotor assembly 34 rotatably positioned within a cylindrical race 43 which is movable to a first displacement position by a first piston 52 and a second displacement position by a second piston 53 . A pintle 26 extends into a bore 36 of a rotor 33 of the rotor assembly 34 and has first and second ports 27, 28 for delivering fluid to and from the rotor 33 . In order to reduce the size of the radial piston device and to minimize the number of external lines, a control valve 66 is positioned within a bore 59 of the pintle 26 and selectively controls fluid flow from one of the first and second ports 27, 28 to the first and second pistons 52, 53 for shifting the cylindrical race 43 between the first and second positions.
