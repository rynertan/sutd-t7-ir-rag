# Solid state compass.

## Abstract
A solid state compass having a pair of flux gates orthogonally disposed on a gimballed platform and coupled by a single pair of conductors to an electronic subsystem which include a current source for energizing the respective flux gates and a detection and control circuit to provide control of flux gate energization and to detect signals derived from each flux gate and from which compass heading is derived.
