## Description
SILICON ON SAPPHIRE LASER PROCESS TECHNICAL FIELD This invention is related to metal oxide semiconductor devices formed in silicon on sapphire in which the channel mobility is increased and the edge of the silicon island is improved by application of an energy beam. BACKGROUND ART It is well known in the art that the speed of metal oxide semiconductor MOS devices may be increased by forming each individual MOS field effect transistor FET in a silicon island on a sapphire substrate which is isolated from other MOSFET s. Fabrication of such silicon on sapphire SOS devices is accomplished by growing epitaxial silicon on a sapphire substrate and then etching the silicon.to form individual islands on which individual MOSFETS may be fabricated. A significant problem in the art of silicon on sapphire SOS is the low channel mobility which results from a high defect density at the top epitaxial silicon surface. Reduction in channel mobility decreases the device operating speed. Another problem is that aluminum conductors interconnecting between individual MOSFETS on the sapphire substrate must cover a nearly vertical step formed at the edge of each silicon island. A reduction in the thickness of the deposited aluminum conductor and cracks in the aluminum may occur in the vicinity of a vertical step. Such cracks and reduction in the thickness of the deposited aluminum increases the likelihood of discontinuties in the aluminum conductor which cause device failure. Another problem which is peculiar to SOS devices is that growth of a silicon dioxide layer over the silicon island usually is accompanied by a region of reduced oxide thickness resulting in a V shaped groove at the lower corner of each silicon island edge. If a polycrystalline silicon conductive layer is deposited or grown thereover, the amount of insulation between the overlying polysilicon conductor and the silicon island is greatly reduced at the V shaped groove, thereby increasing the likelihood of breakdown conduction through the insulating oxide film between the polysilicon conductor and the silicon island. All of the foregoing problems may be solved in the present invention, in which a beam of radiant energy such as a laser beam is applied to the silicon island before formation of the overlying insulating and conducting layers. The energy and power density of the beam are sufficient to melt of the top epitaxial silicon layer, with a concommitant enhancement of channel mobility. Carrier mobility in thin surface regions of a given area of semicondutor material is improved by rapidly heating the surface area to or slightly above the melting point of the semiconductor material and then allowing the material to rapidly cool below its melting point in the recrystallisation process. Significantly, this in turn leads to an increase in the speed of transistors formed in the silicon.The exposure to a laser beam also causes the material in the silicon island edge to reflow, resulting in a reduction in the slope of the silicon island edge. The face of the silicon island edge becomes smoother during this reflow process, so that the roughness of the face is eliminated to provide a smooth and gradually sloping step. A significant result of the use of this process is that oxide film overlying the silicon island has a uniform thickness even in the vicinity of the bottom edge corner of the silicon island. The uniform thickness of the oxide film provides uniform insulation between an overlying polysilicon conductor and the silicon island, therby eliminating the problem of breakdown conduction at the bottom edge corner of the silicon island. Thus, the present invention provides in a first aspect a method for increasing carrier mobility in a surface region of semi conductor material 2 which is characterised by irradiating a predetermined surface area of the semi conductor material with a radiation beam 13 of a chosen energy per unit area sufficient to elevate the temperature of the surface region bounded by said area to the melting point of the semi conductor material, and thereafter allowing the semi conductor material to cool below its melting point while recrystallizing to solid state. It should be noted that, if high temperature furnace processing were used in an attempt to avoid the foregoing problems, high leakage currents at the siliconsapphire interface between the source and the drain of the MOS transistor would occur. Such problems are avoided in this invention by applying a laser beam of sufficiently short wavelength and pulse duration so that the radiation is absorbed within a thin surface layer and over a time period shorter than the characteristic longitudinal thermal transport time of the silicon island. In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the silicon islands are exposed to radiation from an excimer laser emitting radiation having a wavelength of o 2490 A, a pulse duration of 25 nanoseconds, a beam size in the range of 0.1 to 0.2 cm2 and an energy density in the range of 0.5tol.0 joules cm2 . Alternatively, a pulsed ion beam or electron beam source may De used in a similar fashion. Furthermore, a continuous laser, ion or electron beam source, may be used in which the beam is scanned across the surface of the device. Following application of the laser beam, the roughness on the edge face of each island has been found to disappear, and the step defined by each island edge has been found to be more gradual. Subsequently, a first oxide layer is grown, followed 7 by deposition and definition of polysilicon conductors, which are then implanted simultaneously with implantation of source and drain regions.Thereafter, a top oxide layer is deposited, contact openings are etched through the oxide layers followed by deposition and definition of aluminum conductors. The resulting step coverage of overlying aluminum conductors was found to be improved, the thickness of the aluminum conductors being uniform throughout the device, thereby solving the problem of discontinuities normally encountered in step coverage by the aluminum layer.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION FIG. 1 is a simplified cross sectional view of a silicon on sapphire SOS island including a sapphire substrate 1 and a silicon island 2 photolithographically defined by an etching process to form an island edge 3. The island edge 3 has a steep slope created during definition of the silicon island 2. Referring to FIG. 3, a first oxide layer 6 is preferably grown over the top surface of the silicon island 2 and the thickness of the oxide layer 6 is reduced at a bottom edge corner 8 of the island, forming a V shaped groove 9. Thereafter, a polysilicon conductor 10 shown inFIG. s 2 and 3 is fdrmed by deposition of polycrystalline silicon followed by photolithographic definition and etching. The deposited polysilicon fills the V shaped groove 9 so that there is a significant likelihood of breakdown conduction between the polysilicon conductor 10 and the silicon island 2 in the vicinity of the V shaped groove 9. The polysilicon conductor 10 is deposited, photoli thographically defined and etched. Thereafter, the device is ion implanted to render the polysilicon material conductive while simultaneously forming gate aligned source and drain diffusions in the silicon island 2, in a manner wellknown in the art. A second layer of oxide 11 is then placed over the device. Contacts not shown are defined through the oxide layers. An aluminum conductor 12 shown in FIG. s 2 and 4 is formed by evaporation followed by photolithographic definition and etching. Because the etching process which initially defines the edge 3 of theSOS island 2 shown in FIG. 1 is not uniform, the resulting island edge 3 is rough. FIG. 4 clearly shows that the thickness tl of the aluminum conductor 12 deposited over the steep island edge 3 is significantly reduced with respect to the aluninum thickness t2 overlying horizontal surfaces. This reduction of the thickness of the aluminum conductor 12 at the edge 3 increases the probability of discontinuities in the conductor 12. As a result, it has been found that the processing yield of metal oxide semi conductor silicon onsapphire MOS SOS devices is significantly reduced. The foregoing problems are solved using the method of the present invention illustrated in FIG. 5 by directing a pulsed beam 13 of radiant energy from an energy source 14 such as a laser toward the silicon island 2 prior to the growth or deposition of overlying insulating and conductive layers. The drawing of FIG. 5 is purely schematic and does not imply any restriction on required beam size. The energy beam 13 causes reflow of silicon in the island edge 3, and the result is a reformed island edge 3 shown in solid line in FIG. 5. Furthermore, the energy beam improves the quality of the crystal structure of the silicon island 2, which increases the channel mobility of metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors MOSFET s fabricated on the silicon island 2. It should be noted that, in order to increase mobility, the energy beam may be applied either before or after definition of the silicon island 2, Mobility in MOS transistors is a well known concept in the art and is discussed, for example, in Penny, et al., MOS Integrated Circuits, Van Nostrand, Reinhold Co., 1972, pages 162 168, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference. Referring to FIG. s 7 and 8, an oxide layer 6, a polysilicon conductor 10, a second oxide layer 11 and an aluminum conductor 12 are deposited in the manner described in connection with FIG. 1 4. The reformed island edge 3 has a moderate slope, being oriented at approximately 600 with respect to the top of the sapphire substrate 1. Referring to FIG. 8, the moderate slope of the island edge 3 permits the deposited aluminum conduction layer 12 to assume a nearly uniform thickness along the island edge, reducing the likelihood of physical discontinuities in the aluminum conductor 12. Referring to FIG. 7, the likelihood of breakdown conduction at the bottom edge corner 8 between the polysilicon conductor 6 and the silicon island 2 is significantly reduced because the V shaped groove 9 is eliminated due to the reduced slope of the silicon island edge 3 . In the preferred method y this invention, the energy beam source 14 of PIG. X is is a pulsed excimer laser, emitting a beam 13 having a pulse duration of approximately 25 nanoseconds, a wavelength of approxi o mately 2490x, and an energy density between 0.5 and 1.0 2 joule cm . However, it should be recognized that the scope of this invention includes the use of any pulsed beam source or continuous scanning beam source, including an electron, ion or laser beam source in accordance with the present method. The method of this invention is applicabie to any MOS SOS structure similar to that of FIGS. 6, 7, and 8 it which the first insulating layer is any suitable dielectric, including grown silicon oxide, chemical vapor deposited silicon dioxide, grown silicon nitride, or grown silicon dioxide with chemical vapor deposited silicon nitride. The first insulating layer 6 may be grown or deposited silicon dioxide SiO2 or silicon nitride Si3N4 of the type discussed by Pliskin, Comparison of Properties of Dielectric Films Deposited byVarious Methods , Journal of Vacuum Science Technology, Vol. 14, No. 5, September October 1977, pp. 1064 1081. The first conductive layer 10 may be any polycrystalline or amorphous material, such as polycrystalline silicon or it may be polycide or metal silicide of the type disclosed in Crowder et al, lum MOSFET VLSITechnology Part VII Metal Silicide InterconnectionTechnology A Future Prospective , IEEE Trans. onElectron Devices, Vol. Ed. 26 No. 4, April 1979, pages 369 371. Alternatively, the conductive layer 10 may also be a refractory metal layer of the type disclosed inShah, Refractory Metal Gate Processes for VLSIApplications , IEEE Trans. on Electron Devices, Vol. ED 26,No. 4, April 1979, pp 631 640. The disclosures of the above identified Crowder, Shah, and Pliskin publications are hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. In summary, this invention is a unique processing technique for improving silicon on sapphire device performance by improving the crystal structure of the silicon islands to increase channel mobility and thereby improve device operating speed. Another improvement is made by causing the silicon material in the vicinity of the silicon island edge to reflow in such a way as to decrease the slope of the island edge and to increase smoothness of he island edge. This is effected by rapidly heating the surface of the silicon islands to or slightly above the melting point of the semiconductor material by irradiating the surface with a radiation beam and then allowing the material rapidly to cool below its melting point in the recrystallisation process. Overlying aluminum conductive layers are of more unform thickness throughout the device, even in the vicinity of the island edge, advantageously decreasing the probability of discontinuities in the aluminum layer. Finally, improvement of the SOS island edge prevents formation of a V shape groove in the first oxide layer at the bottom island edge corner, thereby decreasing the probability of breakdown conduction between polysilicon conductors and the silicon island.
