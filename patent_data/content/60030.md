# ELECTROPHOTOGRAPHIC COPIER

## Abstract
The photocopier uses a development process employing a magnetic brush formed on a rotating sleeve 102 of non magnetic material in which a system of permanent magnets 108 rotates. The outer surface of the sleeve is subjected to a sandblasting process after grinding in order to create a very uniform finely roughened surface in order to make the thickness of the toner layer forming the magnetic brush constant. The photocopier also employs a toner fixing system operating cold and under pressure by means of a pair of rollers 56, 58 of different diameter rotating at the same angular speed in order to create slippage of the upper roller relative to the lower roller for the purpose of obtaining perfectly flat copies. The coppier also contains a single circuit board 80 for the low voltage and high voltage supply.
