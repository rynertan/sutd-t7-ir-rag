# A method of slicing veneer.

## Abstract
In veneer slicing, the surface portion of the log or block to be sliced is heated but to a relatively shallow depth. Heating preferably is effected by infrared radiation, whereby the large hot water vats at present in use can be dispensed with, and a veneer of very high quality is obtained at lower cost and with a minimum of waste.
