# Zinc oxide particles with narrow size distribution.

## Abstract
Zinc oxide particles of narrow size distribution having the spheroidal particles of from 0.1 to 0.3 mu m in mean diameter and having a standard deviation of less than 30 percent of the mean particle size are prepared by contacting a hydrocarbyl zinc hydrocarboxide with water in the presence of a reaction medium such as toluene and ethanol at the temperature from 0 DEG to 110 DEG C.
