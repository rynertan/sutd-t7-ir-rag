# Permanent magnet field type DC machine.

## Abstract
A permanent magnet field type DC machine in which the amount of flux from field poles is changed by effective use of armature reaction thereby to improve characteristics of the DC machine. There is provided a permanent magnet field type DC machine having field poles 3, 4 formed of permanent magnet members 3 and auxiliary magnetic pole members 4 of high permeability which are provided in parallel with each other in the direction of rotation on the peripheral surface of a yoke 2 to oppose an armature 5 with an air gap therebetween, the auxiliary magnetic pole members being magnetized by armature reaction thereby to change the total amount of field magnetic flux from the field poles, wherein the gap between the auxiliary magnetic pole members and armature is selected to be smaller than that between the permanent magnet members and armature, thereby decreasing the reluxtances in the paths of the auxiliary magnetic pole members, so that the armature reaction can be effectively used.
