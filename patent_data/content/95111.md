# ROLL CASTER WITH ISOTHERMAL SHELL COOLING

## Abstract
A roll caster for continuous casting of metals in strip form wherein each of the casting rolls has a roll and a shell over each roll. Each roll has at least one axial feed bore for supplying coolant into the roll and at least one axial drain bore for draining the coolant from the roll. A plurality of parallel annular groove surround the roll for flowing coolant between the roll and the shell. A plurality of radial feed passageways and radial drain passageways connect each axial feed bore and each axial drain bore, respectively, to annular grooves with each of said radial feed passageways and each of said radial drain passageways servicing at least one annular groove and with the radial feed passageway connected to an annular groove on the generally opposite side of the roll from the radial drain passageway for the same groove and with each radial feed passageway extending radially outwardly from an axial feed bore in a direction generally opposite from each immediately adjacent radial feed passageway and with each radial drain passageway extending radially outwardly from an axial drain bore in a direction generally opposite from each immediately adjacent radial drain passageway to provide substantially isothermal cooling of the casting roll s shell.
