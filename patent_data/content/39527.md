# FEED UNIT FOR A DETERGENT AND PACKAGING THEREOF

## Abstract
The invention relates to an improved means of en suring that the sealing edge s of a flat, for instance rectangular, detergent containing sachet is are kept closed. The sealing edge is of the type which is sealed with such a glue that it opens in the water of the wash ing machine at a temperature above room temperature. The improved means consists in that said sealing edges of the sachets may be bent as they are packaged in a box, as a result of which premature opening of the sachets is prevented during transport or after they have been introduced into the washing machine.
