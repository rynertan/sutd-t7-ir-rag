# Anisotropic polymeric magnet in the tubular form and process for producing the same.

## Abstract
In an anisotropic polymeric magnet in tubular form, the magnetization orientation 20 is directed in one di rection perpendicular to the axial line of the tubular magnet. In a bipolar anisotropic magnet in tubular form, the magne tic poles can be formed only at symmetrical portions 10a, b of the magnet with respect to the axial line and an ima ginary line connecting the magnetic poles with each other is parallel to said one direction. In order to symmetrically distribute the magnetism around a tubular bipolar anisotropic magnet, a weld line s 10c, d formed by injection molding of a mixture of fer romagnetic material powder and polymeric material is lo cated in the portion s of the magnet where the magnetic poles are not formed. In the processes for producing the tubular anisotropic magnet, the gate s for injecting a mixture of ferromagne tic material powder and polymeric material is positioned in an injection machine, so that the position of the con fronting ends of the flow s of the mixture do not coincide with the position of the magnetic poles.
