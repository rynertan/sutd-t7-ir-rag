## Description
A hand held circular sawzdisc cutter for woodwork The invention relates to a hand held saw cum cutter of the type having a circular blade or disc viz a power tool for cutting notches, housings and even linear grooves into timber, also for sawing through timbers of a given thickness,The prior art in this field shows hand held power tools for cutting housings and sockets etc , as well as simpler hadheld units with circular blade disc for general sawing purposes, though none exist which are capable of carrying out slotting and grooving cuts in addition to straight sawing all on timber or any such similar material Amongst hand held tools for cutting arc slots, one has a first type described in Italian Patent number 870a969 Swiss priority no, 13 655 under the name of Steiner, and a second type described in Italian Patent no, 27976 A 76 Wo Germany priority no, P25 47 459c3 in the name of Klutz1 The Steiner Ita lian patent has an elongated motor serving as hand grip and is armed with a disc set with axis at 900 to right angled drive, the motor being caused to slide longitudinally within its casing along guides and against the action of a spri ng in such a way that the user pushes forward axially on the motor in order to produce passage of the cutter disc through and out of the forward face of an approjriate box section held flush with the workpiece and in so doing create a slot in the timber itself having the shape of segment to a circle, this destined to accommodate one half of a tenon fillet buttjoining the workpiece with a further timber In the Lutz Italian patent one has a motor and disc identical to the above mentioned, and a similar type or arrangement wherein the disc lies within a box section at the tool fore held flush with the work piece, the motor in this instance hinged out upon a lateral pivot mounted to the box section itself in such a way as to obtain the cut by pushing the motor through a lateral course against the action of a spring, the resulting angular displacement urging the disc trough into thetimber and producing the slot likewise in the form of segment to a circle, The Lutz invention incorporates a bevel gearpair in its angle trrnsmission, The prior art thus outlined standes in red of further improvements vizwith regard to the need for uniting the various functions of arced slot cutting, kerfing of sockets and linear grooves in general, and plain sawing, within the scope of a single hand held power tool, ths allowing the user e specially craftsmen and tradesmen an option of purchasing a single hand held power cutter saw instead of two or three separate power tools, and furnishing him with a more compact and easily manipulated unit,From the foregoing argument one may discern the need for resolving a technical problem posed by the demand for a single hand held woodworking power tool capable of cutting linear grooves and sawing through, in addition to the usual slots and notches, all with the minimum of effort a tool in which angular displacement of the gripped motor is kept to a minimum and in which the cutting tool may be simply extracted and,Ge placed without the need for dismantling the box section hous ing same, which could even be a one piece unit a tool design ed moreover in such a way as to eliminate bevel gearing commonly used for angle transmission thereby doing away with an obstacle in the way of high speed low torque ratios which are necessary, for instance, to the cutting of slots in the form of segment to a circleB The invention described herein resolves the above stated technical problem by the use of a tool off set with respect to the drive motor shaft and capable of being withdrawn from the base box section wherein it is turned by a geartran accommodated within a bell housing capable of rotating with respect to motor shaft aforesaid whilst attached to the motor casing at one extremity thereof, said casing serving as the power tcol handgrip, The bell housing forms a turning piiir with the inner surface of a bushing whose outer surface is knurled and which is threaded in order to engage with and lock against the upper half, or cover, of the base box section for the purposqbf obtaining constant adjustment of the blade disc height showing through the slit located in the box section sole plate1 A further embodiment of the invention replaces this knurled and threaded bushing with a smooth and removable collar made fast to the base box section cover by means of bolts, If need be, spacer may be attached to the splice of the box section lower half by means of bolts thus provid ing for graduated adjustment of the tool cutting heighta Advantages offered by ie invention are these a capacity for linear grooving and straight sawing in addition to slot and notch cutting speedy action, with minimum angular displacement of the motor grip both per se and with respect to the tnnsverse dimensions of the box section, with minimum effort, and with no need whatever fot the user s pressing the sole plate against the workpiece easy extraction and replacement of the cutting bladeldisc regardless of diameter and without dismantling the box housing blade adjustment and withdrawal brought about by the same means adjustment of the handgrip turning angle facility of adjusting the disc height through a preset distance by means of a boltfitted spacer, without the need for checking cuts thus produc edg The invention will now be described by way of example with the aid of the eight accompanying sheets of drawings, in ffiich Fig 1 is a plan of

A spacer block indicated by 71 can be attached by means of bolts 73 to the outer sur face of base box lowefhalf 23 in order to adjust the height of blade disc 9 with respect to the workpiece guide or fence 72 in Fig 8, a graduated protractor plate is bolted at points 75 to aforesaid extension 21 on the base upper half 22, an indicator 76 mounted to bell housing 15 combining therewith in determining the degree to which handgrip axis V must be turned through angle A in order to achieve the desired death of cut,Function in the case of figs 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 and 8 is as fol lows in the event of an arc slot being cut, for instance, once the motor is running and the box housing sole plate 10 offered to the workplece, all that is required is to turn handgrip 4 through angle A in a clockwise direction with respect to the drawing as far as will produce penetration of blade disc 9 to the depth intended see figs 1 and 2. The degree ofytravel through angle A is established by setting the distance between the tip of kit 17 and the stop 19 offered by protrusion 20 issuing from the extension 21 presented by box upper half 22, said travel through angle A and the effort required therefor being minimal the user merely gripping on motor casing extension 4 with his right hand and laying hold on haigrip 31 with his left, then quickly wor ing on first handgrip 4 so as to take same through angle A to the appropriate depth whereupon it will return to its initial position through the agency of spring 29s In the case of Fig 5 and 6 where motor casing 61 offers no grip, the user lays hold on handgrip 65 in order to turn the motor through angle A in like manner, the action being even faster due to a higher drill speed obtained by elimination of bevelgearing, When cutting a continuous groove as in Fig 2 the user must take the tool through angle A to the desired depth and then draw the complete along the line by means of handgrip 31 the same applying when saying through loose or madeup timbers along a given line, With reference to Figs 1 to 6, in order to extract disc or blab 9 from its box housing 11, the clamp formed by portion 42 and box half 22 is loosened by turning lever 32 whereupon a few turns will release threaded collar 37, 38 and 39 thus tipping out the complete disc blade and drive assembly enabling removal of the latter without any need for loosening bolts 24. Adjustment of the blade disc 9 height with respect to box housing 11 is brought about by partloosening or tightening collar 37, 38 and 39 and reclamping on lever 32 the operation being a matter of seconds, It will be observed that the particular shape given to boxhousing 11 furnishes the tool with clear side square with the sole plate, the opposite side accommodating handgrip 31, screwadjustment of angle A, and return spring 29, whilst the area nearestriotor casing 1 offers space for the lever with which to lock threadd collar 37, 38 391 For removal of blade or disc 9 from its box housing as illustrated inFigs 7 and 8 it suffices to loose and withdraw bolts 68 attaching collar 67 to the upper face of box housing upperhalf 22 It will be observed further, that in addition to more simple and convenient embodiment of the pivoted motor type of power cutting tool in terms of use, the invention is also simple, compact and nvenient in techincal design what is more, embodiments wherein Xe motor itself is hung out on the main pivot must be adjusted for cutting depth by means of a complex device working on the pivot itself which does not permit removal of the disc or bkle from its main housing save by dismantling the latter, Furthermore, the degree of offset E between main drive and cutter axis is kept to a minimum in the invention, making it a reduced overall dimension, All such advantages favour a power tool in terms of weight and cost, these being decidedly lower in the embodiments to which the invention relates when measured against those of the prior art,When carrying the invention into effect, materials employed, dimensions, design particulars may all ldiffer from the above description and attached illusbutions without by any means losing technical equivalence neither staying from within the bounds of protection afforded to the invention as claimed below,
