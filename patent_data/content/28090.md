# Control circuit for an electromagnet.

## Abstract
The circuit includes a high voltage converter 10 with a main energy storage element 11 on which is stored a voltage higher than the supply voltage. A switch element 43 connects this main storage element to the electromagnet 40 and to an inductor 61 by way of which energy is transferred to a second ary energy storage element 64 which is used at the end of the electromagnet energisation period to cause rapid collapse of the electromagnet flux.
