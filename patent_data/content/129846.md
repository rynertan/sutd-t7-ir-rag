## Description
This invention relates to new organic compounds which may be represented by the following structural formula wherein R₁ is selected from the group consisting of phenyl substituted by one or two of the group selected from halogen, alkyl C₁ C₃ and alkoxy C₁ C₃ phenyl substituted by one of the group consisting of dialkylamino C₁ C₃ , methylenedioxy, alkylthio C₁ C₃ , alkylsulfonyl C₁ C₃ , substituted arylsulfonyl, amino, alkanoyl C₁ C₃ amino, substituted aroylamino, trifluoromethyl and phenyl pyridinyl pyridinyl substituted by one or two of the group selected from halogen, alkyl C₁ C₃ and alkoxy C₁ C₃ thienyl thienyl substituted by one or two of the group selected from halogen, alkyl C₁ C₃ and alkoxy C₁ C₃ furanyl naphthalenyl and pyrazinyl and R₂ is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and alkyl C₁ C₃ . The compounds of the present invention may be readily prepared as set forth in the following reaction scheme In accordance with the above reaction scheme an appropriately substituted acetonitrile 1 , where R₁ is as described above is reacted with a dimethylamide dimethylacetal 2 where R₂ is as described above. The resulting exothermic reaction produces a crystalline solid which is recovered by evaporation and dissolved in methylene chloride. This solution is passed through hydrous magnesium silicate and hexane is added to the refluxing eluate, giving the α dimethylamino methylene β oxoarylpropanenitrile 3 which is then reacted with aminoguanidine nitrate 4 in the presence of 10 The 3 amino 1 The following non limiting examples illustrate the preparation of the compounds of the present invention. A 50 ml portion of dimethylformamide dimethylacetal was added to 25 g of solid β oxo 2 furanepropanenitrile. This exothermic reaction produced yellow crystals. After one hour the volatiles were removed under reduced pressure and the residue was dissolved in methylene chloride. This solution was passed through a short pad of hydrous magnesium silicate. The eluate was refluxed with the gradual addition of hexane to the point of turbidity. Cooling and filtration gave 35.2 g of the desired compound, mp 117 125 C. A 100 g portion of β oxo benzenepropanenitrile was placed in a 500 ml round bottom flask and 110 ml of dimethylformamide dimethylacetal was added in one portion. The reaction mixture became warm and a homogeneous dark yellow solution resulted, which then solidified. After cooling to room temperature, hexane was added giving crystals which were recovered by filtration. This material 143.6 g, mp 102 105 C is suitable for the subsequent reaction without further purification. An analytical sample of this compound was obtained by dissolution in methylene chloride followed by passage through a short column of hydrous magnesium silicate, concentration of the eluate with the gradual addition of hexane until crystallization occurred, cooling and collection by filtration, mp 111 113 C. Following the general procedures of Examples 1 or 2, the following compounds of Examples 3 31 , shown in Table I were prepared. A solution of 14.5 grams of benzoylacetonitrile in 100 ml of chloroform was cooled to 10 C and stirred as a solution of 13.3 g of N,N dimethylacetamide dimethylacetal in 20 ml of chloroform was added dropwise during 15 minutes. The reaction temperature was not allowed to exceed 5 C. Stirring was continued at 5 to 10 C for two hours after addition ended. The resultant reaction mixture was dissolved in 150 ml of benzene and the solution passed through a layer of hydrous magnesium silicate. Evaporation of the filtrate in air left a yellow residue which was purified by recrystallization from a mixture of benzene and low boiling petroleum ether yield, 5.8 g, mp 105 106 C. A reaction mixture comprising 19.0 g of α dimethylamino methylene β oxo 2 furanepropanenitrile, 16.1 g of aminoguanidine nitrate, 250 ml of ethanol and 11.0 ml of 10 A reaction mixture comprising 73.36 g of α dimethylamino methylene β oxo 2 benzenepropanenitrile, 63.45 g of aminoguanidine nitrate, 500 ml of ethanol and 36.6 ml of 10 When the aminoguanidine nitrate 10 Following the general procedures of Examples 33 and 34, employing the compounds of Examples 3 32 and the appropriate guanidine derivatives, the products of Examples 35 64, given in Table II, were prepared.
