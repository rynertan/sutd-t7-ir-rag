# DRY GAS METERS

## Abstract
A gas meter has oscillating valves 19, 20 which move back and forth on a seat 13 to cover and uncover valve openings. The valves each have a key hole shaped opening 37, 38 . The seat 13 has pins 42, 43 each formed with a key hole shaped head which, when aligned with a respective opening 37, 38 , may be pushed therethrough to form a pivotal mounting for the valve. The valve in use never enters the position in which the key holes are aligned and the pins can be withdrawn.
