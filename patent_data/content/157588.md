# APPARATUS FOR WRITING ON AND OR READING FROM MAGNETIC DISCS

## Abstract
A casing 10 has a front slot 20 for insertion of a disc in its case 23 . The disc case slides into a support 30 spaced above a driving hub and magnetic head 90 on a carriage 91 . The support 30 is urged downwardly by springs 37 but is held in the raised position by pins 32, 33 trapped in slots in tongues 50 to 53 upstanding from a slider 45 . The disc case engages a lever 70 which turns clockwise and engages a lever 61 to turn this also clockwise. The lever 61 disengages from an edge of the slider 45 which moves forwardly under the action of a spring 48 to free the pins 32, 33 and allow the support unit 30 to drop down vertically, guided by the pins 32, 33 in slots 34, 35 . The lever 70 may additionally push a cover on the disc case laterally to uncover slots 24 in the disc case. To remove the disc the slider 45 is pushed back by a button 49 and the posts 50 to 53 cam the pins 32, 33 up wardly again, while springs biasing the levers 61 and 70 reset these levers and eject the disc case.
