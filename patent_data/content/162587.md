# Assemblable freight wagon.

## Abstract
A freight wagon is assembled from a set of building blocks 12,13,14,15,42 and 16 together forming a superstruc ture mounted on a skeletal underframe 11 having at least one axial beam 17 and an upper surface with a modular bearing pattern 19 . The building blocks are selected from a set of building blocks of corresponding modular dimensions, there being a plurality of species of building blocks and sets of congruent building blocks of each species whereby the underframe 11 is usable with alternative superstructures adapted for carrying alternative types of goods and which alternative superstructures are assemblable from alternate selections and combinations of building blocks. The wagon is particularly useful as a railway wagon in a system of wa gons having bearing patterns 19 which are unified in the sense that the modular dimensions are the same although not necessarily having the same number of modules. The wagon is assembled using simple slotted joints suitable for automated assembly.
