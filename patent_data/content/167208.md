# A method for growing an oxide layer on a silicon surface.

## Abstract
In an improved method for thermally growing an oxide layer on a silicon surface of a semiconductor body a first oxide layer portion is grown over the silicon surface in a first thermal oxidation process at a temperature of less than about 1000 C. The semiconductor device is then annealed in a nonoxidizing ambient at a temperature above about 1000 C, and finally a second oxide layer portion is then grown over the first oxide layer portion in a second thermal oxidation process to complete the growth of the oxide layer. The silicon surface may be of either polycrystalline or monocrystalline material. This method avoids both the dopant outdiffusion problems associated with present High temperature oxidation processes and the stress related irregularities associated with known low temperature oxida tion processes.
