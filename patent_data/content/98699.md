# Low surface energy liner of perfluoropolyether.

## Abstract
Low surface energy liner provided by segments of a per fluoropolyether monomer which has been in situ polymerized into a cohesive network which is adhered to a substrate. The low surface energy liner is especially useful as a low adhesion backsize coating for a pressure sensitive adhesive tape.
