# Improvements relating to turntable mountings for record players.

## Abstract
A turnable mounting for a record player comprises a platform 4 for rotatably supporting a turntable 11 . The turntable has three angularly spaced holes, and the shanks of bolts 13 pass freely through the holes and are secured into sockets 3 in the base 2 . Compression springs 17 on the bolts extend between the platform and nuts 16 on the bolts, so that the platform is resiliently supported. Dur ing assembly, the nuts 16 are adjusted to provide the de sired tension in the springs and are set so as to turn with the bolts if the latter are adjusted to effect levelling of the platform. In this way, the setting of the nuts and thus the tension in the springs is not altered. Should the tension in a spring require to be altered, the nut can be held by a spanner whilst the bolt is turned.
