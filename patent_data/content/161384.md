# HUMAN ENDOGENOUS CANCER REGULATORY FACTORS, METHOD OF PREPARING THE SAME, AND PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THE SAME

## Abstract
Human endogenous cancer regulatory factors useful as anti tumor agent having a molecular weight from 50,000 to 72,000 and an isoelectric point in the ptt range from 6.0 to 8.5, and pharmaceutical compositions containing the same, are disclosed. The human endogenous cancer regulatory factors of the present invention are obtained by growing human monocytic cells or cloned strains therefrom in a tissue culture medium to form said cancer regulatory fac tors, followed by isolation from the culture medium and purification.
