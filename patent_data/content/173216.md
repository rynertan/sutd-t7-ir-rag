# Control system for a power converter for driving induction motors.

## Abstract
In a control system CS for a power converter PC for driving induction motors 4 , the control system separately controlling an exciting current component of the primary cur rent of the induction motors contributing to generation of a magnetic flux and a torque current component of the primary current contributing to generation of a torque, a voltage de tecting device 19 detects the output voltage V of the power converter, and a correcting device 21 responds to the volt age detecting device for determining a current correction Δi for correcting at least one of the exciting current component and the torque current component to reduce the difference of the detected voltage V from a reference value V₀ of the out put voltage.
