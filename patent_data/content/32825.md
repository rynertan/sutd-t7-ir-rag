## Description
STABILIZED SOLUTIONS OF DIOCTYL CALCIUM SULFOSUCCINATE IN CORN OIL. This invention relates to stabilized solutions of dioctyl calcium sulfosuccinate in corn oil. Dioctyl calcium sulfosuccinate is sold as a stool softener laxative in the form of soft gelatin capsules. It is preferred over dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate for people with restricted sodium intake. Commercially, the dioctyl calcium sulfosuccinate is dissolved in a non aqueous solvent such as corn oil to which a small amount of glycerol monooleate is added, ostensibly to prevent gelling, see U.S. Patent No. 3,035,973. The problem with such commercially available formulations is that the solution does gel within a relatively short time. This presents no problem if the material has already been encapsulated but results in waste if it has not yet been injected into the capsules. In view of the above, among the objects of the present invention may be noted the provision of a solution of dioctyl calcium sulfosuccinate in corn oil which is stabilized against gelling for a relatively long time, for example, for three months. Other objects and features will be in part apparent and part pointed out hereinafter. The invention accordingly comprises the solutions, dosage units, capsules, and methods for production of the solutions hereinafter described, the scope of the invention being indicated by the subjoined claims. The stabilized solutions of the present invention essentially include a gel retarding amount of a low molecular weight alkanol such as ethyl alcohol or isopropyl alcohol. Since the product solutions are intended for oral ingestion, the alcohol must of necessity be pharmaceutically acceptable, like ethyl alcohol, for such use. Where permitted, other alkanols such as isopropyl alcohol, alone or in admixture, may be used. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, in a solution otherwise corresponding to commercially available products, a suitable dosage unit includes from about 50 to about 300mg of dioctyl calcium sulfosuccinate and, optionally, from about 1 to about 10 percent by volume of glycerol monooleate in sufficient corn oil to make a solution. In this is incorporated, in accordance with the present invention, from about 1 to about 5 percent by volume of a low molecular weight alkanol such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, or a mixture thereof. To ensure against gelling for about three months, it is preferred if ethyl alcohol be present in an amount of from about 2 to about 4 percent, e.g. about 2 percent to about 3 percent, by volume. For some purposes, the glycerol monooleate may be omitted, in which case higher amounts of alkanol are required. For example, to insure against gelling in the absence of glycerol monooleate for as much as three months, it is preferred that at least about 3 percent by volume of ethyl alcohol be included. The solutions of the present invention are easily prepared by predissolving the dioctyl calcium sulfosuccinate in the alkanol, with or without the application of heat. To this solution is added the corn oil and the glycerol monooleate, if any. Since an excess amount of alkanol is needed to solubilize the dioctyl calcium sulfosuccinate, and since excess amounts of alkanol are to be avoided if the stabilized suspension is to be used in soft shelled gelatin capsules, excess amounts of alkanol are removed by distillation or by evaporation at normal pressure or under vacuum. The following examples illustrate the invention. Example 1 Dioctyl calcium sulfosuccinate is prepared by converting the more commonly available dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate into dioctyl calcium sulfosuccinate by acidifying a solution of dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate in isopropyl alcohol with sulfuric acid to precipitate out sodium sulfate. The reaction mixture is then neutralized with calcium hydroxide to form the calcium salt of the dioctyl ester of sulfosuccinate. Example 2 A solution of dioctyl calcium sulfosuccinate as described in Example 1 was evaporated to near dryness on a steam bath and then dried in a vacuum oven at SO0 for 2 hours. A 21g sample of the solid was dissolved in a solution containing 18g of corn oil and 2g of glycerol monooleate by stirring and heating to 70 750C for one and one half hours. The product of this process is like that described in Patent No. 3,035,973 and is not an embodiment of the present invention. The stability of this solution along with the other solutions prepared in the following examples is described in Table 1. Example 3 A solution of dioctyl calcium sulfosuccinate dissolved in isopropyl alcohol containing 50g of dioctyl calcium sulfosuccinate was mixed with 45g of corn oil and 5g of glycerol monooleate. Most of the isopropyl alcohol was removed by slow heating under vacuum. A small amount of isopropyl alcohol, as determined by gas chromotography, was left in the solution. Example 4 The procedure of Example 3 was followed, except that the last traces of isopropyl alcohol were stripped from the solution by bubbling a stream of nitrogen through the solution for one hour at 900C. This solution was then divided into three portions to which were added 0.4, 0.5 and 1.5 percent by volume of ethyl alcohol, respectively. Example 5 A solution of dioctyl calcium sulfosuccinate in isopropyl alcohol containing 156g of dioctyl calcium sulfosuccinate was mixed with 139g of corn oil and 15g of glycerol monooleate, and heated under vacuum to 1300C to remove almost all of the isopropyl alcohol. Portions of this solution were mixed with almost 12 by volume of ethyl alcohol and part of the ethyl alcohol was then removed by vacuum distillation. The distillation of the ethyl alcohol removed the last traces of isopropyl alcohol by co distillation. By stopping the distillation at 80 130 C, 0.5 to 2.1 percent by volume of ethyl alcohol was left in the solution. Example 6 Following the procedure of Example 5, a solution of dioctyl calcium sulfosuccinate in isopropyl alcohol was prepared containing 50g of dioctyl calcium sulfosuccinate mixed with 48g of corn oil with no glycerol monooleate.Ethyl alcohol was added to portions of this solution and then part of the ethyl alcohol removed by vacuum distillation.

In view of the above, it will be seen that the several objects of the invention can be achieved and other advantageous results attained. As various flanges could be made in the above compositions without departing from the scope of the invention, it is intended that all matter contained in the above description shall be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense.
