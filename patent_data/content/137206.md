# Assembly for adjusting an optical element.

## Abstract
An assembly having a compensator plate positional control mechanism includes an optical beamsplitter and a compensator plate which plate is pivoted to vary the pathlength of beams passing therethrough. By varying these pathlengths, the arms of an interferometer can be quite exactly equalized.
