# Pneumatically operated applicator and method of applying adhesive tape.

## Abstract
A pneumatic tool for use on a robotic arm for applying adhesive tape around bundles of wire, cables and the like. Three hollow tubes 3,4,5 are disposed in line abreast and extend from a body 1 which includes a chamber 29 with an inlet port 14 to which pneumatic pressure or suction can be applied and two oppositely acting ball valves of which one is in communication with the central tube 3 and the other is in communication with the interior of the outer tubes 4,5 , which are hollow but which have a respective lateral aperture 33, 33a on the side facing the central tube. On the application of suction, the central tube 3 can hold a length of adhesive tape and the tool can be advanced into contact with the bundle of wires around which the tape is to be applied. On the appli cation of pneumatic pressure, the central tube 3 releases the tape and the pressure applied to the interior of the outer tubes 4,5 advances them forwardly, against the force of a return spring 41 . Air jets issue from the lateral apertures in the tube to force the tape around the bundle of wires.
