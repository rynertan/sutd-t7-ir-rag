# ELASTIC DISC FOR FRICTION CLUTCHES

## Abstract
Elastic disc 1 for engaging a clutch, comprising a clutch disc hub 2 , an annular crown 3 provided with friction clutch members 4 , an annular intermediate element 5 in between the clutch disc hub and crown. Between the clutch disc hub and the annular intermedi ate element, there are interposed two elastic units formed by elastomeric blocks, with the deformability of the first unit being greater than that of the second unit. The first unit comprises blocks 6 , disposed in a symmetrical position with respect to the disc axis, with having their extremities fixed to the clutch disc hub and to the intermediate element. The second unit comprises blocks 7 , fixed to the clutch disc hub and alternated with the blocks of the first unit. Elastic means 24,25 are also foreseen, in between the annular intermediate element and the crown.
