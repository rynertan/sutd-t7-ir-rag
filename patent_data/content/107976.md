# Multicell electric storage batteries.

## Abstract
A recombination lead acid battery includes a plurality of cells comprising alternating positive and negative plates 14, 11 interleaved with separator material 30. Every alternate plate in the two electrical end cells constitutes a unipolar plate connected to a terminal pillar 10 and each remaining plate constitutes one half of a bipolar pair of plates connected by means of an integral bridge piece 28 to its other half in an adjacent cell. The bridge pieces 28 together constitute intercell connectors and those cells which are directly connected by an intercell connector are spaced apart only by the intercell connector and separated only by an air gap whilst those cells which are not directly connected by an intercell connector are separated by an intercell partition 4 integral with the battery container 2.
