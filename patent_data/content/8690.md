# Flexible disk pack assembly.

## Abstract
Air is circulated through flexible disk stack 12 mounted on shaft 16 by centrifugal action which draws air into the centre of the stack via filter 28, controller 26 and plenum chamber 24. Controller 26 provides primary and secondary air flow paths in parallel into chamber 24, the primary and secondary paths being open and closed respectively at start of a disk access operation. To access, transducer head 20 is positioned to cause a partial split between two selected adjacent disks, and the primary path is closed, which develops a high vacuum in chamber 24 and causes the partial split to become a full access open ing. The secondary path includes a valve automatically responsive to pressure in the chamber 24 to supply, after short delay, a throttled flow of gas into the chamber 24, to reduce the vacuum to a level at which the full access open ing is stable.
