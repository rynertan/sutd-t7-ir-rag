# LATEX FOAM PRODUCT LATEX FOAM PRODUCT

## Abstract
A latex foam product may be manufactured by a method comprising applying, onto a carrier sheet, a first layer comprising a layer of a foamed vulcanisable latex composi tion applying, onto the first layer, a second layer of a foamed vulcanisable latex composition and then heating the resulting layered product to effect vulcanisation of the foamed vulcanisable latex compositions in the first and second layers. The method makes it possible to manufacture a two foam layer product, e.g. cushioning components for foot wear, in which the two foam layers are strongly bonded to each other. Because the method involves only one vulcanisa tion operation, it offers both technical and economic advan tages over prior art methods.
