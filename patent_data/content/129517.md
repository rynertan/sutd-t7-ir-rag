# Automatic machine for forming and distributing bakery products of various shapes in baking tins.

## Abstract
The machine comprises a device 2 for kneading sweetened paste 15 that it supplies to an extrusion group 14 constituted by two telescopically coupled, vertical tubular blocks 75 and 76, namely a first fixed tubular block and a second movable tubular block closed at the bottom by an extrusion plate 80 which, with the said tubular blocks, defines a variable volume chamber 82 and a conveyor 18 that supplies baking tins in succession to the overhead said extrusion group 14. When the variable volume chamber 82 is full of paste 15, piped or poured in biscuits B are created with, in the first instance, the volume of the said chamber maintained constant and, in the latter, firstly a decrease and then a volumetric increase. When the paste is piped , the separation from the said extrusion plate 80 of the ropes of extruded paste is achieved with the use of cutting means, while for poured in paste, it occurs through breakage causes by the decompression of the paste in the said chamber 82. When no paste is in the chamber, poured in biscuits are created through, in this order, a reduction in the volume of the chamber, the operation of the kneading device 2 with the consequent extrusion of the paste, and then an increase in the volume of the chamber with the breakage, through decompression, of the ropes of extruded paste.
