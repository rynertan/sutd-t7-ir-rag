# A differential amplifier.

## Abstract
A differential amplifier is disclosed which comprises a first differential amplifying circuit comprising first and second transistors Q11, Q12 of an NPN type, the collector of the first transistor Q11 constituting an output terminal 3 of the amplifier a second differential amplifying circuit com prising third and fourth transistors Q13, Q14 of the NPN type whose bases are inverting and noninverting input terminals, respectively, the base of the third transistor Q13 being connected to the collector of the second transistor Q12 , and the base of the fourth transistor Q14 being supplied with a bias voltage 11 a first load circuit for the first differential amplifying circuit, the first load circuit comprising a fifth transistor Q17 of a PNP type forming a collector load for the second transistor Q12 and a sixth transistor Q18 of the PNP type for forming a collector load for the first transistor 011 , the bases of the fifth and sixth transistors Q17, Q18 being connected to the collector of the fourth transistor Q14 and a second load circuit Q15,Q16 for the second differential amplifying circuit.
