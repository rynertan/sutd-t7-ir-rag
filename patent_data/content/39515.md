# STICK CONFECTION EXTRACTION APPARATUS

## Abstract
An apparatus for extracting several frozen confec tions from the mold cups of the mold member of a freezing apparatus and for conveying the frozen con fections away from the freezing apparatus while rotating each confection 90 and separating the confections to wider intervals. Such extractor conveyor includes a plu rality of extractor bar assemblies and an endless con veyor for moving the extractor bar assemblies from an extraction station to an ejection station. Each extractor bar assembly includes a plurality of gripper units that are initially arranged at relatively close intervals along the length of the extractor bar assembly that are each aligned with their direction of travel. The gripper units are connected by links and are mounted within a trans verse channel so they may be rotated and separated as they are conveyed by a camming rail that is posi tioned to engage a cam follower roller attached to an end gripper unit.
