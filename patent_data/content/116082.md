## Description
The present invention relates to the encoding and decoding of video information and, more particularly, to a method and system for secure transmission of television signals for subscription television or similar video services in which only authorized viewers are permitted to view a video program. With the increased interest and activity in the field of subscription or pay video transmission of all types e.g., broadcast and cable subscription television, long distance satellite transmission, television transmission of textual information, etc. . there has arisen a need for more secure transmission of high quality video information. To this end, numerous video encoding or scrambling techniques have been developed and some are now in use, particularly in broadcast systems where there is no control over who receives the signal and thus the signals must be encoded to prevent unauthorized use of the received signals. One known type of broadcast subscription television system transmits a video signal that is modulated by a sine wave signal such that the blanking and synchronizing levels cannot be recognized by a normal television receiver. The display, without decoding, is unintelligible or at least very annoying to a viewer. However, by rather simple means that are readily available to an average consumer, the system can be easily defeated by non subscribers. As this becomes more widely known to the public, the number of unauthorized viewers grows and the incentive to pay for the services diminishes. This, in turn, detracts from the desirability on the part of video program producers to permit the use of their programming, particularly if they are paid as a function of authorized viewers or revenues collected. Other approaches to television signal scrambling have proven to be more secure and may, in fact, make it practically impossible to unscramble the video signals without highly sophisticated and extremely expensive equipment. One such approach is to invert lines or fields of video information on some basis that can be reproduced at the subscriber location to permit viewing of a normal picture. Thus, for example, one known system inverts alternate parts of the video information and a decoder at the subscriber location can reinvert those inverted portions to reconstitute the original video. Another known system inverts fields of video information on a random basis and sends a code with the scrambled video to instruct the decoder as to how the received video has been inverted. An example of this latter type of system is disclosed in US A 4,024,576. Security tends to be adequate in approaches to video scrambling in which the video information is randomly inverted and a secure code is transmitted with the video so that the decoder can properly reinvert, but difficulties arise with respect to picture quality. For example, inversion and reinversion of video signals may result in a reconstituted video signal that varies in d.c. level from line to line or field to fleld. Because of this variation, a flicker or other annoying effect appears in the television display making it unpleasant for viewing. Various measures have been employed to eliminate or at least reduce this problem with varying degrees of success. Clamping the video signals to the same d.c. level has been somewhat successful, but some annoying effects may still remain. Also, the additional circuitry required to eliminate or reduce the annoying efforts of these types of scrambling add cost and complexity to the decoders. Less expensive and perhaps more effective approaches, such as less frequent inversion, have been suggested, but they seem to have a tendency to reduce the security of transmission and only serve to reduce the annoyance, not eliminate it. It is accordingly a general object of the present invention to provide a novel method and system for scrambling or encoding television signals wherein the difficulties of the prior art systems mentioned above are obviated. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a novel television video encoding and decoding method and system in which there is an extremely high amount of security, wherein the encoding is sufficient to render an encoded television signal unintelligible or at least extremely annoying to watch, and wherein the decoded video signal is devoid of annoying abnormalities introduced during encoding, yet no special efforts must be made to eliminate encoding abnormalities. It is another object of the present invention to provide a novel television signal scrambling system particularly suitable for broadcast pay television or other television systems meant only for authorized users. One system that is directed to achieving these general objectives is disclosed in WO A 8102499 In the system disclosed therein, the video signal is encoded by delaying parts of the signal relative to other parts in a determinable manner to thereby rearrange the sequence of transmission of the parts in a fashion that can be reproduced at a remote location. Generally this rearrangement is accomplished by storing successive parts of the video signal and retrieving the stored parts in an order or sequence other than their normal sequence. The rearrangement of the sequence of video signal parts can be accomplished on a line basis or a field basis. In the specific embodiments of the invention disclosed in the previously mentioned patent application, each part of the video signal that is to be delayed relative to another part comprises one or more digital samples of the signal. For example, each horizontal line of the signal can be divided into 256 segments of digital information that are stored and rearranged relative to one another to thereby scramble the signal. The rearrangement can be accomplished by the manner in which the segments are stored in a storage device such as a shift register, or the manner in which it is retrieved therefrom. The system disclosed in the noted application has been determined to be successful in achieving the foregoing objects. It is an objective of the present invention to provide a method and system for secure transmission of video signals that is an improved version of that system, particularly from the standpoints of cost and security. More specifically, when a video signal is digitized prior to rearrangement of its various parts, the hardware necessary to carry out the analog to digital conversion of the signal is relatively expensive, in comparison with the other components of the signal encoding or decoding system. Consequently it is desirable to be able to rearrange the parts of the signal while they are in an analog format, to thereby forego with the expenses associated with the conversion of the signal into digital samples prior to scrambling, and subsequent reconversion of the scrambled signal into analog form for transmission. Furthermore, a digital implementation of the scrambling technique imposes a practical limitation on the portions of the signal that ran be rearranged. When the video information contained in each horizontal line of the signal is digitized and subsequently reconverted to analog form, the information can be recaptured relatively error free. However, because of the nature of the synchronization pulses and associated timing information in each line of the video signal, any reliable digitization and subsequent reconversion of this portion of the signal requires relatively complex and expensive equipment when utilizing presently known technology. Consequently, in a practical system the video and synchronization portions of the signal are separated, and only the video information portion of each line of the signal is digitized and scrambled. The synchronization information is not encrypted and is recombined with the scrambled video portion of the signal before transmission. US A 4070693 discloses a system for transmitting a secure television image. In order to ensure only authorised television receivers are able to display the television image intelligibly a portion of the scan line of the television image is rotated prior to transmission. The point at which the rotation takes place is determined by a random number generator and information indicating the rotation point is transmitted during the vertical retrace interval. Thus, a similar random number generator at the receiver may be synchronised so that the television image received may be decoded. However, the image must be digitised before it is rotated. Furthermore, there is no disclosure in this document of a means whereby the television image may be encrypted in at least one of two different modes. In addition, this document does not disclose the use of an encrypted decode key transmitted to the receiver which must be decrypted before a pseudo random signal may be generated at the receiver. The system disclosed in this document has many of the disadvantages outlined above with respect to WO A 8102499. It is a more specific object of the present invention to provide a novel method and system for encoding and decoding a television signal that performs the encoding and decoding operations while the signal is in an analog format, to thereby avoid the costs associated with converting a signal into digital form and subsequently reconverting it into an analog signal. It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a novel method and system of this type in which various portions of a video signal are rearranged relative to each other so that both the synchronization pulses and the video information are not suitable for use by a conventional television receiver while in their scrambled form. It is still a further object of the present invention to provide a novel system for controlling the encoding and decoding of a television signal with a pseudo random control signal that is not transmitted with the television signal. It is still another object of the present invention to provide a highly secure system for controlling the encoding and decoding of a television signal with a code that is generated independently at both the transmitting and receiving ends of a television system in accordance with a control word that is transmitted in an encrypted form with the television signal. The present invention provides a method for enabling only authorized receivers to display a television program in an intelligible manner comprising the steps of In addition, the present invention provides a method for receiving and decoding an encrypted television program signal by authorized viewers characterized by In a further aspect the present invention provides an apparatus and a method set out in the claims for receiving and decoding an encrypted television program signal by authorized viewers for use in a television program distribution system wherein the television program signal is encrypted by modifying the program signal in accordance with a pseudo random signal having at least two states and is transmitted to a receiver station in the encrypted form with a control signal related to the generation of the pseudo random signal. Said apparatus is characterized by In accordance with the present invention, the foregoing objects and their attendant advantages are achieved by feeding a composite television signal comprising both video and timing or synchronization information into a series of analog delay devices and retrieving the information from the delay devices in a predetermined cyclic fashion so that one part of the signal is delayed relative to another. In a preferred embodiment, each horizontal line of the television signal is divided into two segments by analog delay devices, each having a delay period equal to one half the horizontal scan period. The two segments of each line overlap one another slightly to thereby eliminate switching transients when the signal is reconstituted in its original form. To compensate for the overlapping portions of the signal, another portion of the signal that can be easily reconstituted at the receiving end is omitted from the transmitted signal. The encoding of the television signal is carried out selectively in accordance with the binary state of a pseudo random binary signal. This pseudo random signal is generated independently at each of the transmitting and receiving stations, rather than being transmitted with the television signal to thereby provide a higher level of security. Synchronization of the two independently generated signals is assured by a control word and an initialization word that are periodically transmitted with the television signal, and at least one of which is encrypted prior to transmission. Decryption of the control or initialization word is carried out with a secret key stored at the receiving station. Thus, even if an unauthorized user is in possession of the schematics for the decoding circuits, it will not be possible to decode the scrambled signal since the pseudo random signal cannot be generated without the secret key. The manner in which the present invention operates in accordance with the foregoing principles will become more readily apparent upon a perusal of the following detailed description of preferred embodiments of the invention illustrated in the accompanying drawings.

Figures 1A and 1B illustrate a standard or normal color television signal before it is superimposed on a carrier for transmission or after demodulation . This illustrated signal is the standard for the United States but it is to be noted that the standard or normal television signal for other countries may differ somewhat. Acordingly, Figures 1A and 1B are illustrative of only one of a possible number of television signals. As is illustrated in Figure 1A, the color television signal is composed of consecutive fields each including synchronizing signals which contain timing information and video signals which convey color and contrast information. Each field commences with a vertical blanking interval comprised of equalizing pulses, vertical synchronization pulses and horizontal synchronization pulses. At the TV receiver, this vertical blanking interval also referred to as the blanking pulse blanks the cathode ray tube beam as it is returned from the bottom to the top of the display TV screen , and the horizontal scanning circuits are stabilized in synchronization with the horizontal sync pulses prior to the arrival of the first horizontal line of video information. At the end of the vertical blanking interval, a horizontal sync pulse signifies the start of the scanning of a line of video information from one edge of the television display or picture tube to the other edge, normally from left to right when viewed from the front of the picture tube. The video signal information modulates the electron beam or electron beams in a color system as the beam is scanned. A horizontal blanking pulse blanks the retrace of the electron beam from right to left and a horizontal sync pulse then signifies the start of the next line of video information. Two consecutive lines of video information actually 1 1 2 consecutive lines at the beginning of a second field of video information are shown in Figure 1B. The result of scanning two consecutive fields of video information as seen by a viewer on the face of the picture tube is illustrated in Figures 1C and 1D. As can be seen in Figure 1C, the face of the cathode ray picture tube is scanned with video information starting at the top left and ending at the bottom right of the display. Since the first 21 horizontal sync pulses are used to stabilize the horizontal sync circuits during vertical blanking, the first visible scan line of the first field is the twenty second line L22 . Moreover, in the first field, for purposes of interlacing with the lines of the second field, the last line scanned is a half line. Thus, the first field can be described as containing lines 22 through 262 1 2. The second field is similar except that for the purpose of interlacing the very first scanned line is a half line and the last line is a whole line. Thus, the second field can be considered to contain lines 22 1 2 through 263, or alternatively lines 263 through 525. The two consecutive fields of interlaced lines together comprise one frame of the television program. In Figures 1C and 1D, the beginning and end of each horizontal scan line is designated B and E, respectively, to faciliate an understanding of the present invention. In accordance with the invention, the normal TV signal is encoded or scrambled such that if the video information contained in the encoded signal were displayed by a standard television receiver without decoding, the resultant picture presented to the viewer would have parts rearranged in sequence relative to their normal positions in the scanning sequenece. The parts that are rearranged may be individual scan lines e.g., the sequence of scan lines in a field can be rearranged , the fields, or other parts of the video signal such as individual segments of a scan line. As will be appreciated this rearrangement of sequence of video signal parts will result in a picture that is unintelligible or at least very annoying to watch. To faciliate an understanding of the invention, the rearrangement of individual portions of scan lines in accordance with one preferred embodiment of the invention is illustrated in Figures 2A B. Each of the horizontal scan lines is divided into two segments. The half line segments for three consecutive lines are respectively labeled A, B, C . . . The first half of each line, i.e. A, C, E, contains synchronization information and some video information. The second half of each line, i.e. B, D, F, contains the remaining video information. The various segments are rearranged according to the encoding scheme A, C, B, D, F, E, resulting in the scrambled signal illustrated in Figure 2B. It will be appreciated that a signal of this type will cause an unintelligible picture to be displayed on the television screen if it is not first unscrambled. The first line of the scrambled signal, SL22, contains two horizontal synchronizing pulses and portions of the video information for the left hand portion of two consecutive lines of the normal signal, as viewed in Figs. 1C and 1D. The next line, SL23, contains no synchronizing information, and the following line SL24 contains one synchronizing pulse, but that pulse is located in the middle of the line, rather than the beginning thereof. Thus, not only is the video information in the television signal scrambled, but the synchronization information necessary for proper operation of the receiver scanning circuits is also unusable. Apparatus for transmitting a television signal in this scrambled form and subsequently receiving and descrambling the signal in accordance with the present invention is generally illustrated in block diagram form in Figures 3A and 3B. Referring to Figure 3A, the transmitting end of the encoding system includes a program source 10 which generates a composite video signal CVS comprising video information and synchronizing signals. The program source 10 can include a suitable conventional video camera and associated synchronizing circuitry, a video recorder, or any other source that provides a suitable composite video signal. The composite video signal CVS is fed to a sync generator 12 that extracts timing information from the synchronizing signals. This timing information includes a clock pulse train having a frquency f In addition to the f The output signal from the codes insertion unit 16 is a modified composite video signal MCVS that includes the inserted codes. This signal is supplied to a cyclic encoder 18, which selectively scrambles the signal, for example by rearranging portions of the lines of video in the modified composite signal MCVS in the manner illustrated in Figures 2A and 2B. The encoded output signal ECVS from the cyclic encoder 18 is applied to a suitable conventional transmitter 20 to appropriately modulate the vision carrier and be transmitted via airwaves, hardwired cable, or any other suitable transmission medium or combination of two or more of them. The rate at which the cyclic encoder operates is controlled by a 2f The operation of the cyclic encoder 18 is controlled by a pseudo random binary sequence signal PRBS generated by the encoder control unit 22. The PRBS signal contains a series of binary ones and zeros arranged in a pseudo random order. The particular state of the PRBS signal at any one time instructs the cyclic encoder 18 to either scramble the MCVS signal in the manner described previously to result in a signal such as is shown in Figure 2B, or to remain idle and enable the MCVS signal to pass to the transmitter 20 in an unscrambled state as shown in Figure 2A. The encoder control unit 22 includes a pseudo random binary sequence generator 24 for producing the PRBS signal. The operation of the generator 24 is influenced by a setup or control word, TAPS, that determines the manner in which binary state information is routed within the generator to establish the PRBS output signal. The TAPS signal is generated at the transmitting end in an encrypted form, and supplied to the codes insertion unit 16 for insertion into to MCVS signal. It is also provided to a decryptor 26 within the encoder control unit 22 where it is unscrambled and supplied to the PRBS generator 24. The decryption of the TAPS word is controlled by a master key stored within a memory unit 28 within the encoder control unit. The PRBS generator 24 is enabled to produce the PRBS signal by an enable gate signal ENGT generated by the sync generator 12. For example, it can be enabled during lines 22 through 262 of each field, to thereby scramble the lines of video that appear on the television display screen while leaving intact the earlier lines of each frame that contain the codes inserted into the CVS signal. Each time that the generator 24 is disabled, it produces a state word STAT that indicates the state of each of its registers. This STAT word is supplied to the codes insertion unit 16 to be transmitted with the codes inserted into the beginning of the next field of the CVS signal. In addition to the previously described information that is inserted into the CVS signal to produce the MCVS signal, the codes insertion unit 16 can insert information relating to control of the decoders in a pay television system. For example, the subscriber control information can include billing data that is stored at a subscriber s decoder to desribe the particular programs that are viewed by a subscriber, and category information that enables or disables a particular decoder in dependence upon the content of the program or the like. At the receiving end of the encode decode system, illustrated in Fig. 3B, the received encoded video signal ECVS is applied to a sync generator 30 by a conventional receiver circuit 32 which can provide appropriate demodulation of the received signal. The sync generator counts the lines of each field in a frame of the video program and produces an extraction enable signal EXEN and an enable gate signal ENGT at appropriate times during each field of the signal. The extraction enable signal EXEN is applied to a code extractor unit 34 which reads the subscriber control information, the encoded TAPS setup word, the word clock WCLK and the state word STAT from the received signal, and replaces them with a blanking level signal. The subscriber control information and the word clock are supplied to a subscriber control unit 36, which allows the subscriber to accept encoded programs for viewing. Upon indication of acceptance by the subscriber, the control unit generates a decode enable signal DEC that is provided to a cyclic decoder 38. In addition, it can store the billing information contained within the received signal for subsequent access by a central billing computer, as disclosed more fully in US A 4,163,254. The TAPS word and the STAT word from the code extraction unit are provided to a decoder control unit 40 that generates a PRBS signal. The decoder control unit 40 includes a decryptor 42 that receives the encrypted TAPS word, decodes it according to the master key stored in a memory unit 44, and applies it to a PRBS generator 46. This generator operates in response to the enable gate signal ENGT from the sync generator 30 and the STAT word from the code extraction unit 34 to generate the PRBS signal. The decode enable signal DEC and the PRBS signal actuate the cyclic decoder 38 to selectively rearrange the half line segments of video from the scrambled state illustrated in Figure 2B to the unscrambled state illustrated in Figure 2A, and produce a decoded composite video signal CVS. This signal is applied to a remodulator 48 that remodulates it to any desired user s frequency band, for subsequent viewing of the program on a conventional television receiver. The timing of the operations performed in the decoding system is controlled by a receiver clock generator 50 that receives the f A cyclic encoder 18 or decoder 38 for arranging and rearranging parts of the composite video signal in the manner shown in Figs. 2A and 2B is illustrated and explained in greater detail in Figs. 4 7. The encoder decoder comprises an odd number i.e. 2n 1, where n is an integer greater than zero of analog delay elements 52. Each delay element 52 provides a discrete time delay to a signal applied to its input terminal. In the embodiment illustrated in Figure 4, n 1 and the time delay provided by each delay element is 1 2 T The three delayed signals provided by the three delay elements 52 are respectively provided to the data input terminals D1 D3 of a three throw, single pole switch 54. The particular one of the input terminals that is connected to the output terminal of the switch is determined by an input control signal generated by a cycle sequence generator 56. As depicted in Figure 4, the cycle sequence generator includes three output lines Q1 Q3 that are connected to three control input lines of the switch 56. The generator produces a signal on each line in sequence to successively connect each one of the data input terminals of the switch to its output terminal in a continuing sequence. The time sequence of the connection of the switch output terminal to the various switch input terminals defines the encoding decoding cycle. The encoding cycle may be any time sequential pattern wherein the switch output terminal is connected to the various data inputs for a length of time equal to 1 2 T Two general encoding cycles or modes can be used. One encoding cycle is obtained when the switch output is continuously connected to the n 1 Td delayed signal for a period of time equal to J 2n 1 T One embodiment of a cycle sequence generator is illustrated in greater detail in Figure 5. Basically, it comprises three D type flip flops 58 62 connected in series to form a shift register. The output terminal of the last flip flop 62 in the series is connected to the data input terminal of the first flip flop 58. Each flip flop is clocked by the 2f The operation of the cycle sequence generator of Figure 5 is shown in the timing diagram of Figure 6. when one or both of the PRBS and ENBL signals is low, the output of the AND gate is low, causing the flip flops 58 and 62 to be held in a reset state and the flip flop 60 to be held in a set state. Thus, the Q1 and Q3 output signals of the cycle sequence generator are low and the Q2 output signal of the generator is high. Consequently, the D2 input terminal will remain connected to the output terminal of the switch, so that the output signal from the second delay element 52 will be presented as the output signal, i.e,. the cyclic encoder decoder operates in the first coding cycle. In other words, the output signal will be delayed by the length of one full horizontal scan period relative to the input signal to the encoder decoder. When both the ENBL and PRBS signals are high, the high output signal from the AND gate 64 removes the clear and preset signals from the flip flops 58 62, and enables a binary one bit to be shifted through the register formed by the flip flops. This shifting occurs on the leading edge of each pulse in the 2f The manner in which this cyclic operation of the encoder decoder functions to provide a scrambled signal is illustrated in Figure 7. The undelayed video signal is labeled In order to eliminate switching transients due to the break in the middle of each horizontal line, which could cause an annoying line down the middle of the television display screen, the video information in two adjacent time delay elements 52 of the encoder decoder is preferably overlapped by a minimum predetermined amount. This feature can be accomplished by appropriate control of the timing and input signals to the charge coupled devices so that the first few samples of the signal in one device are the same as the last few samples in the immediately preceding device. During switching from one data input terminal to another in the switch 54, the latter input terminal is connected to the output terminal prior to disconnecting the former input terminal, so that both are connected for the predetermined overlap time. To compensate for the extra time allotted to the video portion of each line, the horizontal sync pulse can be correspondingly shortened in length during storage in the delay element. A second embodiment of an encoding decoding device is illustrated in Figure 8. In this embodiment, the rearrangement of the parts of the video signal is not necessarily done in a cyclic manner as in the preceding embodiment, but rather can be carried out in a more random, yet predetermined, fashion. The composite video signal CVS, or modified composite video signal MCVS from the codes insertion unit 16, is fed into an analog shift register, such as a charge coupled device 66, at a suitable sampling rate determined by a clock signal SCLK. The samples of the portion of the signal stored therein, e.g. a horizontal line, one half of a horizontal line, or some other suitable portion of the video signal, are read out in parallel by a tap circuit 67. The CCD 66 and the tap circuit 67 could be forced by a Reticon TAD 32 tapped analog delay, for example. The parallel output signals from the tap circuit 67 are fed to a transfer circuit 68. This circuit selectively rearranges the order of the video signal samples in a predetermined fashion in response to a scramble control signal SCR, that may be determined by the binary states of the PRBS and ENBL signals, for example. The transfer circuit 68 can be implemented with a circuit that is analogous to the demultiplex switch for the Fairchild 321A analog shift register, for example. Essentially, this circuit selects one of a number of input signals and presents it as the output signal. In a simplest form, the transfer circuit 68 could operate on one of two modes to selectively leave the samples in their original order or reverse their order. At the other extreme, it could have a number of interconnect patterns equal to the factorial of the number of samples in the CCD 66. The particular interconnect pattern that is used at any. one time could be determined by the control signal SCR. The selectively scrambled samples from the transfer circuit 68 are fed to an injection circuit 69, that transfers them into a second CCD 70 at suitable time intervals. For example, when one half of a video line is stored at a time, the transfer from one CCD 66 to the other CCD 70 can be controlled by the 2f As the ECVS signal is being read from the second charge coupled device 70, the next portion of the video signal can be read into the first CCD 66. A more detailed illustration of a preferred embodiment of the encoder control unit 22 appears in Figure 9. The master key memory 26 can comprise a read only memory ROM that produces a multi bit output signal relating to the key. Alternatively, it can be a programmable read only memory PROM , or an erasable programmable read only memory EPROM so that the key can be changed periodically by a transmitted signal rather than by physically replacing the ROM or PROM. Each of the output bits of the memory 28 are respectivey fed to one input terminal of an EXCLUSIVE OR gate 72 in the decryptor 26. The other input terminals of the EXCLUSIVE OR gates 72 receive a bit of the encrypted TAPS setup word. The output signals from the EXCLUSIVE OR gates 72 comprise the decrypted TAPS setup word, which is applied to the PRBS generator 24. The PRBS generator comprises a series of binary delay elements such as D type flip flops 74. A modulo 2 adder 76, i.e. an EXCLUSIVE OR gate, is inserted between each stage to receive the output signal from one flip flop and apply it to the D input terminal of the next succeeding flip flop. The output signal from the last stage 78, which comprises the PRBS bit, is fed back to the D input terminal of the first stage. In addition, it is selectively applied to various ones of the modulo 2 adders 76 by tap switches 80 that are actuated by the TAPS setup word. These switches are preferably digitally controlled switches. All of the flip flop stages 74,78 are clocked by the ECLK clock signal from the master clock circuit 14. The PRBS generator 24 generates a long binary code sequence that, for time intervals less than the code sequence repetition period, exhibits statistical properties similar to truly random thermal noise. The sequence length of one form of PRBS generator, of the type illustrated in Figure 9, is given by 2 The output signal from each of the flip flops 74,78 is applied to a parallel to serial shift register 82, whose output signal comprises the STAT signal describing the status of the PRBS generator. As described previously, this signal is supplied to the codes insertion unit 16 to be periodically inserted into the video signal. The decoder control unit 40 is generally similar to the encoder control unit 26, as illustrated in Figure 10. More specifically, the decrypted TAPS setup word actuates selected tap switches 80 to control the feedback arrangement of the RRBS generator 46. The flip flops 74 in the generator are periodically cleared by a disable signal DIS generated by the sync generator 30, which sets the output signals of all of the stages to zero. The STAT signal is fed into a serial to parallel shift register 84, whose output signals are applied to the preset input terminals of the flip flops 74 after the flip flops have been cleared. Thus, when a receiver is first turned on, its PRBS generator will be initialized so that its status is the same as that of the generator at the transmitting end. Upon recognition of a synchronization signal in the received video signal, the sync generator 30 produces the enable gate signal ENGT that is applied to an AND gate 86 in the PRBS generator 46. This enable signal allows the DCLK clock pulses to be applied to the flip flops 74 to generate a new PRBS signal after initialization. The synchronization signal can be the horizontal sync pulse for any particular line in the field of the received video picture, for example. In operation, at the beginning of a field of the television program signal, a TAPS setup word is generated at the transmitting end and applied to the encoder control unit where it is decrypted to control the feedback arrangement of the PRBS genrator 24. When the sync generator 12 detects the tenth line of the field, for example, it generates the insert enable signal INEN, as illustrated in Figure 1E. This signal is applied to the codes insertion unit 16 to enable the TAPS signal, the subscriber control word, the STAT signal from the register 82 and the word clock WCLK from the master clock circuit 14 to be inserted into the vertical blanking interval of the video signal. At a predetermine synchronization point in the video signal, for example the sync pulse for the twentieth line in the field, the clock enable gate signal ENGT is generated to enable the PRBS generator to begin producing the PRBS signal. However, this signal will not actuate the cyclic encoder 18 since the encoding enable signal ENBL is still low. At the twenty second line of the field, for example, the ENBL signal from the sync generator goes high, to thereby alternately operate the cyclic encoder 18 in the first and second modes in accordance with the state of the PRBS bit. The resulting signal ECVS from the cyclic encoder is sent to the transmitter 20 to be broadcast or otherwise transmitted. Alternatively, the enable gate signal ENGT can be applied to the encoder 18 as the ENBL signal, to thereby actuate the encoder at the same time as the PRBS generator. At the receiving end of the system, the sync generator 30 counts the lines in each field and produces the PRBS gerator disable signal DIS to clear the stages of the generator. This signal is produced relatively early in the field, for example upon detection of the third horizontal scan line. In the tenth through twenty second lines the extract enable signal EXEN is generated to permit the TAPS setup word, the subscriber control, the STAT initialization word and the word clock WCLK to be read from the received signal. The TAPS word is applied to the decrypter 42 of the decoder control unit to be decrypted and arrange the feedback format of the PRBS generator 42. The STAT word is applied to the flip flops of the PRBS generator 42 to initialize it according to the status of the PRBS generator 24 at the end of the preceding field. When the sync generator 30 detects the horizontal sync pulse for the twentieth line it produces the clock enable gate signal ENGT to initiate actuation of the PRBS generator 42 and simultaneously synchronize it with the PRBS generator 24. Upon detection of the twenty second line, the decode enable signal ENBL is generated. In the meantime the subscriber control information in the transmitted signal is extracted and supplied to the subscriber control unit 36. If the subscriber decides to view the program being transmitted and if the subscriber s particular decoder is eabled by the control information, the subscriber provides an accept indication that causes the decode signal DEC to be generated. This signal is applied to the cyclic decoder, and with the enable signal ENBL, permits the decoder to be selectively actuated in one of its two modes according to the binary state of the PRBS signal, to thereby rearrange the parts of the video signal to their original order. It will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that the present invention can be embodied in forms other than those specifically disclosed herein. For example. the parts of the video signal that are rearranged to encode the signal need not be half line segments of each horizontal scan. They can be multiple segments of a line, full lines, groups of lines, fields, etc., depending on the storage capacity and setup of the analog delay elements. In such cases, the delay time of each analog delay element and the frequency at which the cycle sequence generator is clocked would be correspondingly changed. In another variation, more than three delay elements can be utilized in the cyclic encoder to provide a greater number of parts that are rearranged relative to one another. In addition. the cyclic encoding and decoding of the signal need not be carried out at the baseband frequency. The video signal can first be modulated onto an RF carrier signal, and the resulting signal encrypted before transmission and decrypted before demodulation. In another aspect of the invention, an encoding device other than a cyclic encoder can be utilized to scramble the video signal. Any type of encoder that is capable of operating in two or more modes under control of the PRBS signal can be successfully employed. In this regard, the PRBS signal can comprise more than one bit to control the encoder in a number of different modes. For example, the various bits ran be extracted from various stages in the PRBS generator. It would also be feasible to encrypt the STAT initialization word in addition to the TAPS word, prior to transmission. under the control of a second master key, to thereby further increase the security against unauthorized decoding.
