## Description
This invention relates to improvements in a method of controlling the cooling of a hot rolled steel sheet after hot rolling and an apparatus therefor. In response to the aim toward reduced manufacturing cost of steel products, recently, there have been developed methods of producing hot rolled steel sheets, including the utilization of the technique of strengthening the transformed structure by the control of cooling after hot rolling as a measure of producing high strength steels in as hot rolled state by use of a steel material having a low alloy component value or values, the utilization of the technique of refining the crystal grains by the controlled rolling as a measure of simultaneously achieving both the highly toughening and highly strengthening of the steels, further, the combined utilization of both the technique of strengthening the transformed structure and the technique of refining the crystal grains, and so on. There are proposed various techniques concerning the method of controlling the cooling and the conditions of cooling in these cases. However, in most cases of these conventional methods, it is common to use the surface temperature of the hot rolled steel sheet as being a material to be cooled as a control index of the conditions of cooling. In the cases where these methods are used, the following problems are posed. In consequence, it is apparent that the above described problems cannot be coped up with when there is adopted the method of controlling the cooling under the cooling conditions using the temperature as the control index as in the prior art. The most effective measure to obviate the above described problems is to directly online detect the behaviour of transformation of the steel sheet and adopt a control method based on this information. As proposals concerning the above described method for example, there are known Japanese Patent laid Open No. 104754 1975 GB A 1501 751 and Japanese Patent Publication No. 24017 1981. However, each of the above described proposals is a method of aiming at controlling the cooling conditions so that the transformation can always occur at a predetermined position when a variation of the transformation properties occurs at a position in the cooling zone, where the transformation occurs. Therefore, the method remains to the extent where slight improvements are applied to the method of using only the temperature as the index of control as in the prior art. This is because of a deficiency in the means for detecting the behaviour of the transformation and, for example, the detecting device proposed in Japanese Patent Laid Open No. 104754 1975 can detect only the presence of occurrence of a gamma to alpha transformation. Further, in the case of Japanese Patent Publication No. 24017 1981, there is merely adopted an indirect means for detecting a phenomenon of heat return during the transformation by a thermometer. In consequence, the behaviour of transformation of the steel cannot be satisfactorily grasped, whereby the controlling accuracy of the cooling conditions cannot be improved, thus posing the problem in the homogeneity of the material quality. On the other hand, as the method wherein the gamma to alpha velocity of transformation is used as a control factor, the present applicant has proposed a method of producing the high strength steel excellent in flatness, featuring that, in cooling after hot rolling a steel containing 0.005 0.5 wt C, 0.05 2.0 wt Si and 0.3 3.0 wt Mn, an accelerated cooling in which a gamma to alpha velocity of transformation on the average from the start of cooling to the end of cooling falls within a range of 1 20 s is applied up to the time of the end of cooling where the gamma to alpha transformed fraction of the steel reaches a range of 60 100 , and after the time of the end of cooling, air cooling is applied. However, by this method, the velocity of transformation during the cooling was not strictly controllable as in the present invention. The present invention has been developed to obviate the above described disadvantages of the prior art and has as its object the provision of a method of controlling the cooling of a hot rolled steel sheet, having a material quality controlling function with high accuracy which has been difficult to attain by the prior art, securing the homogeneity of the material quality in particular and being suitable for making the steel sheets into ones having various material qualities by the cooling, and an apparatus therefor. To achieve the above described object, the present invention contemplates that, in a method of controlling the cooling of a hot rolled steel sheet after hot rolling, as the technical gist thereof is shown in Fig. 1, the method includes A specific form of the present invention is of such an arrangement that the velocity of transformation is easily and simply detected such that, when the gamma to alpha transformed fraction is Y , an elapsed time from the start of cooling is t sec , constants determined by chemical components of the steel sheet are K and a, and a value depending upon the velocity of transformation is n, the value n depending upon the velocity of transformation is determined through an equation shown below, subsequently, the elapsed time t regarded as the time of the completion of transformation is calculated through the above equation by use of n thus determined and the gamma to alpha transformed fraction regarded as the substantial completion of transformation, and the velocity of transformation is calculated by use of the elapsed time t thus calculated. Another specific form of the present invention is of such an arrangement that the velocity of transformation is replaced by the time period required for the proceeding of the gamma to alpha transformation such for example as the time period required from the start of the transformation to the completion or the time period required for the proceeding of the transformed fraction from 20 to 80 , whereby the calculation is facilitated, so that the same effect as in the case, where the velocity of transformation is made to be a control factor, can be obtained. A further specific form of the present invention is of such an arrangement that the control of the cooling conditions is performed during threading of the hot rolled steel sheet so that satisfactory control can be performed from the midway of the hot rolled steel sheet. A still further specific form of the present invention is of such an arrangement that the control of the cooling conditions is reflected in the setting of the cooling conditions of a succeeding hot rolled steel sheet, so that satisfactory control can be performed from the top end of the succeeding hot rolled steel sheet. A yet further specific form of the present invention is of such an arrangement that the cooling water flowrate or the cooling time period in a section, in which the cooling is controlled, is varied in proportion to a deviation value between a measured value and the target value of the transformation rate so as to perform the control of the cooling conditions, so that the control of the cooling conditions can be easily and reliably performed. To achieve the above described object, the present invention contemplates that, in an apparatus for controlling the cooling of a hot rolled steel sheet after hot rolling, the apparatus includes A specific form of the present invention is of such an arrangement that the transformed fraction detector includes The present invention has been created by the present applicant on the basis of the discovery of a close relationship between the gamma to alpha velocity of transformation of a steel sheet during the cooling and the mechanical properties of the hot rolled steel sheet after the cooling, as the result of the devoted studies on the relationship between the behaviour of transformation during the cooling and the material quality of the steel, by use of the detectors for detecting the transformed fraction as proposed by the present applicant in Japanese Patent Application No. 64147 1983, which corresponds to U.S. Patent Application No. 658,606, Canadian Patent Application No. 465,120, European Patent Application No. 84112092.6 and Korean Patent Application No. 6253 1984. Description will hereunder be given of the results of studies made by the present inventors on the relationship between the velocity of transformation and the mechanical properties, which relationship is the technical basis of the present invention. Table 1 shows the contents of steels A D, and Ceq in Table 1 indicates numerical values calculated through an equation shown below. The steels A D as shown in Table 1 were finish rolled by a finish rolling mill at a finish temperature of 850 C, and thereafter, were subjected to the cooling under the cooling conditions where the velocity of transformation consciously varied within the ranges of 6 70 sec for the steel A, 3.5 25 sec for the steel B, 2.8 10.0 sec for the steel C and 2.4 8 sec for the steel D, and the hot rolled steel sheets 12 each having a thickness of 3.2 mm were produced. Fig. 2 shows the results of study of the relationship between the average velocity of transformation from the start of transformation to the completion during the cooling as measured by the transformed fraction detectors A1 A8 and the tensile strength of the hot rolled steel sheet 12 after the cooling, on the various steels shown in Table 1. For the purpose of comparison, Fig. 3 shows the results of study of the relationship between the coiling temperature as being a control factor of the cooling conditions in the prior art and the tensile strength after the cooling. From the comparison between Figs. 2 and 3, it is apparent that the degree of correlation with the tensile strength is larger in the case where the velocity of transformation is made to be a control factor according to the present invention than in the case where the coiling temperature is made to be a control factor in the prior art. On the basis of the above described results, the present applicant has found the method of controlling the cooling, in which the velocity of transformation as being the transformation behaviour having direct correlation with the mechanical properties of the steel is made to be a control factor, can perform the material quality control more accurate than the method of controlling the cooling resorting to the measuring of temperature such as the cooling rate, coiling temperature or the like, and the present applicant has combined the means for measuring the transformation rate during the cooling used in the System for Online Detecting Transformation value and or Flatness of Steel or Magnetic material previously proposed in his Japanese Patent Application No. 64147 1983, to thereby achieve the present invention. In consequence, the information of transformation quantitatively online detected in the cooling zone is used to control the cooling conditions after hot rolling, so that the controlling accuracy of the cooling conditions can be considerably improved. As the result, the material quality control with high accuracy, which has been difficult to attain by the conventional method, can be conducted, and particularly, the homogeneity of the material quality can be secured and it is possible to make the steel sheets into ones having various material qualities with high accuracy by the cooling. In other words, according to the present invention, it is possible to control the material quality with high accuracy as compared with the conventional method of controlling the cooling through the control of the coiling temperature, and particularly, the following outstanding advantages can be achieved. The exact nature of this invention, as well as other objects and advantages thereof, will be readily apparent from consideration of the following specification relating to the accompanying drawings, in which like reference characters designate the same or similar parts throughout the figures thereof and wherein Detailed description will hereunder be given of one embodiment of the present invention with reference to the drawings. Firstly, processes of manufacture for working the method according to the present invention will be described. Referring to Fig. 4, designated at 10 is a finish rolling mill within a hot rolling process, 12 a hot rolled steel sheet, and 14 a water pouring device for pouring the cooling water for cooling a hot rolled steel sheet 12 onto the steel sheet 12 in forms of mist, jet, pipe laminar flow or slit laminar flow for example. The cooling water is fed from a water supply device 16, adjusted in flowrate by a water flowrate adjusting valve 20 driven in accordance with the instructions of a valve controller 18, and thereafter, poured onto the hot rolled steel sheet 12 through the water pouring device 14. Denoted at A1 A8 are the transformed fraction detectors which quantitatively detect the gamma to alpha transformed fraction of the hot rolled steel sheet 12 passing over the detectors A1 A8 and deliver measurement signals to a calculator 22. The valve controller 18 is connected to the calculator 22 and operated by a control signal from the calculator 22, to thereby adjust the opening degree of the valve 20. In addition, indicated at 24 is speedometer for measuring the speed of conveyance of the hot rolled steel sheet 12 on a runout table, B1 a thermometer for measuring the temperature of finish rolling, B2 a thermometer for measuring an intermediate temperature of the hot rolled steel sheet 12 on the runout table, B3 a thermometer for measuring the coiling temperature and 26 a coiler. Any desirable measuring means may be adopted as the transformed fraction detectors A1 A8, only if the means can rapidly and quantitatively online detect the rate of gamma to alpha transformed fraction of the hot rolled steel sheet 12. However, in this embodiment, there is used the System for Online Detecting Transformation value and or Flatness of Steel or Magnetic material previously proposed by the present applicant in his Japanese Patent Application No. 64147 1983. These transformation value online detectors A1 A8, as the typical example thereof is shown in Fig. 5, includes In addition, in Fig. 5, designated at 54₁ is a magnetic flux generated in the exciting coil 53 and interlocking with the detection coil 55₁ and 54₂ a magnetic flux interlocking with the detection coil 55₂. The state where the steel sheet 12 does not start the transformation, i.e., in the gamma single phase, the steel sheet is in the paramagnetic state. So, the magnetic fluxes 54₁ and 54₂, which interlock with the detection coils 55₁ and 55₂, have constant strengths corresponding to the distances L₁ and L₂ from the exciting coil 53, respectively, whereby induced voltages in proportion to the distances L₁ and L₂ are generated respectively hereinafter referred to as the initial states . When gamma to alpha transformation is caused to the steel sheet 12 and the ferromagnetic alpha phase precipitates, the alpha phase is magnetized, a variation is caused to the magnetic field intensity of the steel sheet 12 and the strengths of the magnetic fluxes 54₁ and 54₂ are shifted from the initial states, which are detected as the changes in the induced voltages from the detection coils 55₁ and 55₂, respectively. Detection signals 56₁ and 56₂ of the above described detection coils 55₁ and 55₂ are delivered to the calculator 57, whereby the magnitudes in measured signal of the detection coils 55₁ and 55₂ are compared with each other, so that the transformed fraction of the steel sheet 12 can be determined by the calculator 57. Description will hereunder be given of one embodiment of the method of controlling. As shown in Fig. 1 above, according to this embodiment, in the method of controlling the cooling of the hot rolled steel sheet 12 after hot rolling, a target value of the velocity of transformation required for obtaining mechanical properties ultimately expected from the hot rolled steel sheet 12 is previously determined, the gamma to alpha transformed fraction of the hot rolled steel sheet 12 in the section, in which the cooling is controlled, is detected by the transformation rate detectors A1 A8, the elapsed time from the start of cooling is detected to determine the velocity of transformation of the hot rolled steel sheet 12 in the cooling stage, and the conditions of cooling is controlled so that the velocity of transformation in the cooling stage can coincide with the target value. In determining the target value of the velocity of transformation a target point of the start of transformation and a target point of the end of transformation for achieving the target value of the velocity transformation are determined from the speed of conveyance of the hot rolled steel sheet 12 on the runout table, and this section is made to be the section, in which the cooling is controlled, and inputted to the calculator. In setting the velocity transformation it is desirable that the relationships between the velocity of transformation and the mechanical properties with every steel types are previously grasped as will be described hereunder and the setting is performed on the basis of the relationships. Detection of the velocity of transformation is performed in the following manner. Firstly, the cooling is started at a cooling flowrate, for a cooling time period and in a cooling pattern, in accordance with the target value of the velocity of transformation. Subsequently, an actual gamma to alpha transformed fraction of the hot rolled steel sheet 12 is measured by the transformed fraction detectors A1 A8, and the velocity of transformation is calculated from the gamma to alpha transformed fraction and the elapsed time from the start of cooling obtained from the speed of conveyance of the steel sheet 12 at that time, and the like. Needless to say, in calculating the velocity of transformation the larger the number of the transformed fraction detectors in the section, in which the cooling is controlled, is, the more accurate the measurement is. However, if a measured value at least at one position in the section, in which the cooling is controlled, is obtained, then it is possible to predict the average velocity of transformation from the start of transformation to the completion. Namely, according to the knowledge of the present inventors, in the processing of the transformed fraction on the runout table, if the gamma to alpha transformed fraction is Y and the elapsed time from the start of cooling is t sec , then the relationship therebetween can be given through the aforesaid equation 1 . In consequence, if substitution of the messured value of Y by the transformed fraction rate detectors A1 A8 and the elapsed time t calculated from the speed of conveyance into the equation 1 is made to determine n, and subsequently, the value t at the time of the value Y e.g., Y 99.9 substantially representing the completion of transformation is calculated by use of the value n above, then the average velocity of transformation from the start of transformation to the completion can be predicted. The aforesaid measure of calculation is made to be executed by the calculator 22, so that the average velocity of transformation can be determined from the measurement signal from the transformed fraction detectors A1 A8 and the signal from the conveyance speedometer 24. The following is the control of the cooling conditions, which is performed such that the velocity of transformation in the cooling stage approximates the target value of the velocity of transformation. More specifically, the measured value of the velocity of transformation determined as described above is compared with the initially determined target value, when the measured value of the velocity of transformation is smaller than the target value, the cooling water flowrate or the cooling time period in cooling control section is increased in proportion to the deviation value through the valve controller 18 and the water flowrate adjusting valve 20 so as to increase the velocity of transformation and, when the measured value of the velocity of transformation is larger than the target value, the cooling flowrate or the cooling time period is decreased in proportion to the deviation value through the valve controller 18 and the water flowrate adjusting valve 20 so as to decrease the velocity of transformation so that the cooling conditions in the cooling control section can be corrected to approximate the target velocity of transformation. Correction of the cooling conditions may be performed during threading of the hot rolled steel sheet 12, or may be reflected in the setting of the cooling conditions of a succeeding hot rolled steel sheet 12. Additionally, the meaning of the velocity of transformation used in this specification is grasped in a broad concept including the cases where the velocity of transformation may be replaced by a time period required for the proceeding of the transformation such for example as the required time period from the start of the transformation to the completion or the time period required for the proceeding of the gamma to alpha transformed fraction from 20 to 80 . Description will hereunder be given of comparison between the effect of controlling the material quality of the hot rolled steel strip as produced according to the present invention with the result of production according to the conventional method. Steels A D shown in Table 1 are used, finish rolled into steel sheets each having a thickness of 3.2 mm under the finish rolling temperature of 850 C, thereafter, coiling after cooling by the control of cooling according to the method of the present invention, where the velocity of transformation is made to be the control index, and by the control of cooling according to the conventional method, where the coiling temperature is made to be the control index, and under the respective conditions of the cooling control targets, which will be described hereunder. Fig. 6 is a chart showing a target tensile strength, target cooling conditions, actual results of cooling conditions, and tensile properties obtained when the cooling is performed under these cooling conditions. In addition, as for the respective conditions of the cooling control targets, in order to obtain the target tensile strengths with every steels on the three levels shown in Fig. 6, in the case of the present invention, the target value of the velocity of transformation required from the view of the relationship between the tensile strength and the velocity of transformation as shown in Fig. 2 is determined, and, in the case of the conventional method, the target value of the coiling temperature required from the view of the relationship between the tensile strength and the coiling temperature as shown in Fig. 3 is determined. Furthermore, the tensile properties were examined by use of tensile specimen of JIS Japan Industrial Standard 5 on the hot rolled steel strip manufactured as described above at positions obtained by dividing the hot rolled steel strip into twenty portions in the lengthwise direction of rolling. The results of the examination of the tensile properties are shown in Fig. 7 as the variation values of the tensile strengths in the coil. In Fig. 7, the abscissa represents a mean value TS av of the tensile strengths at twenty points in the coil, and the ordinate indicates a value obtained by subtracting the minimum value TS min of the tensile strengths at twenty points in the coil from the maximum value TS max of the tensile strengths at twenty points in the coil. As apparent from this Fig. 7, in the case of the production according to the conventional method, with steels having the chemical compositions identical with each other, there is a tendency that the variation value of tensile strength in the material is increased with the increase of the target tensile strength. In comparison between the steel types different from each other, there is a tendency that the higher the C equivalent weight in the steel type is, the larger the variation value of tensile strength in the steel type is. With the examples produced by the method according to the present invention, it is found that, in either case the variation value of the tensile strength in the material is small, and the hot rolled steel strip high in homogeneity can be produced.
