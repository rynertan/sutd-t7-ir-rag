# Barge tipplers or dumpers.

## Abstract
A tippling installation for the discharge of bulk goods from large barges comprises a dry basin 2 in which a trough shaped cradle 12 can have its ends sealed against opposite end walls 4 of the basin in which there are lock gates 24 . The cradle provides a holding vessel into which the barges can be floated through the lock gates. After closing the gates and draining the cradle, the barge is tipped by rolling the cradle sideways along guide and support tracks 34 while the barge is held clamped in the cradle. The contents of the barge are discharged into a receiving space 10 from which any liquid is drained to separate it from the discharged solids that are then collected. The arrangement is able to prevent pollution of the waterway be the escape of any of the barge contents during discharge and it is able to handle very large barges because they roll on fixed supports relatively little lifting effort needs to be expended.
