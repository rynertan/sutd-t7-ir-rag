An automatic tool changer for transferring single tools and or multiple spindle toolheads between a tool storage magazine 90 and a horizontal spindle 82 of a machine tool. A plurality of single tools and or toolheads are stored in the tool storage magazine 90 with their shanks in a vertical position. A first tool change arm 94 transfers a selected tool or toolhead from the storage magazine 90 to a tilt unit 92 which tilts the shank of the tool or toolhead by 90 from a vertical to a horizontal position parallel with the axis of the spindle. A second tool change arm 96 removes the tools or toolheads from the tilt unit 92 and spindle 82 simultane ously, interchanges them and inserts the interchanged tools or toolheads into the spindle 82 and tilt unit 92 . The tilt unit 92 then tilts by 90 back to the vertical position, and the first tool change arm 94 returns the tool or toolhead from the tilt unit back to the tool storage magazine 90 . Each mul tiple spindle toolhead 405 has support and clamp means on its rear portion which coacts with support and clamp means on the spindle head 72 of the machine to support the toolhead 405 and hold it stationary while the shank 406 and tools 408 of the toolhead are rotating with the spindle 82 .
