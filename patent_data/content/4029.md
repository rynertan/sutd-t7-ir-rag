# An anion permeable, fluid impervious membrane, process for its preparation, electrolysis cell comprising said membrane and an electrolytic process using said membrane.

## Abstract
Novel membranes for electrochemical cells permeable to anions, fluid impervious and resistant to halogens and acidic and oxidizing environments comprised of copolymers of 1 divinylbenzene or halogenated vinyl monomers and 2 at least one member of the group consisting of 2 vinyl pyridine and 4 vinylpyridine with the compolymers being optionallyl N alkylated or N arylated, processes for preparing the said membranes and electrochemical cells and processes using the said membranes.
