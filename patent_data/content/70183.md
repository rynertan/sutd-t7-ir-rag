# Light sensitive color photographic material.

## Abstract
A light sensitive color photographic material having a support and, coated thereon, at least two light sensitive silver halide emulsion layers respectively sensitive to lights of different spectral regions, characterized in that each of the light sensitive emulsion layers comprises at least two emul sion layers having different light sensitivities and containing negative type light sensitive silver halide crystals essentially consisting of silver iodobromide containing silver iodide at a proportion not higher than 4 mole . This invention provides a silver halide color photo graphic material, in which the proportion of the silver halide utilized for the formation of a color image to the total silver halide used is enhanced remarkably.
