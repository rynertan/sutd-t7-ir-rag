# ANTIBODY TARGETED CYTOTOXIC AGENT

## Abstract
Specific cytotoxic agents are provided comprising anti body specific for a surface antigen joined to a cytotoxic agent, desirably by a reductively cleavable linkage. Particu larly, the cytotoxic portion of various toxins may be joined to a monoclonal antibody or fragment thereof by a disulfide linkage. The conjugate is found to be toxic for susceptible cells having the determinant site recognized by the receptor. The conjugates can be used for isolating mutant culture cells and therapeutically for destroying mutant cells present in a host.
