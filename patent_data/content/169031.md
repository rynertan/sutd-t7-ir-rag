# Improvements in and relating to thin film deposition.

## Abstract
An apparatus for depositing a mono or multimolecular lay er film on a substrate has a trough 1 in which the liquid sub phase W is received, the sub phase carrying a monomolecular layer film of e.g. a diacetylenic fatty acid. The apparatus has a barrier system 4 consisting of a boom 40 which is pivoted on the centre of a rigid spoked ring 42 and pivotable towards and away from the adjacent spoke to compress the molecular layer the desired amount. The vertical position of the ring is ad justable by bolts 24 to position the upper surface of the adja cent spoke 41 and lower surface of the boom 40 below but not through the liquid surface. This enables the monomolecular layer to be compressed without leakage of molecules and also allows contaminants to be collected by sweeping the boom across the surface before the layer is added.
