# Waste material incineration system and method.

## Abstract
A waste material incineration system which includes a longitudinally directed furnace 14 having a first combustion zone 42 and a second combustion zone 44 . The waste material is inserted into the first combustion zone 42 through a material inlet and falls into the rist combustion zone 42 by gravity assist. A mechanism for vortexing the waste material is mounted within the first combustion zone 42 and such vortexing mechanism includes a mechanism for inserting pre heated air into the first combustion zone 42 with the pre heating air mechanism extending adjacent the second combustion zone 44 . The incineration system further includes a mechanism for removing particulate material from the first combustion zone 42 .
