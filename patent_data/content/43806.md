## Description
Motor Vehicle Transmission System The present invention relates to a transmission system for a motor vehicle with a front mounted engine and gearbox disposed transverse the longitudinal axis of the vehicle, including a front differential, the spider of which is driven by a gear carried by the secondary shaft of the gearbox, for transmitting driving torque to the front wheels of the motor vehicle.The object of the present invention is to provide a transmission system of the type specified above, which allows driving torque to be transmitted to all the four wheels of the motor vehicle and which is simple to construct and of small bulk.In order to achieve this object, the invention provides a transmission system of the type specified above, characterised in that it further includes a rear differential for transmitting driving torque to the rear wheels of the motor vehicle, an intermediate differential constituted by an epicyclic gear train which is enclosed in the casing containing the front differential and which connects the spider of the latter to the said gear carried by the secondary shaft of the gearbox, a bevel gear fixed to the planet carrier of the intermediate differential, and a bevel pinion meshed with the said bevel gear and connected kinematically to the rear differential.As a result of these characteristics, the driving torque is distributed correctly by means of the said intermediate differential between the two axles of the motor vehicle. At the same time, the intermediate differential structure is formed within the casing for the front differential such that the bulk of the latter is not altered to any considerable extent.In addition, the toothed gear used for transmission to the rear differential is disposed within the casing for the front differential.According to a further preferred characteristic, the transmission system forming the subject of the present invention is further provided with means for locking the intermediate differential, adapted to render the spider of the front differential rigid with the planet carrier of the intermediate differential.Further characteristics and advantages of the invention will emerge from the description which follows with reference to the appended drawings, provided purely by way of non limiting example, in which Figure 1 is a perspective view of a transmission system according to the present invention,Figure 2 is a partially sectioned view of a detail of the transmission system of Figure 1,Figure 3 illustrates a detail of Figure 2 in a different condition of operation,Figure 4 is a further sectional view of the detail of Figure 2, andFigure 5 is a section taken on line V V of Figure 2.In Figure 1, there is shown schematically an internal combustion engine 1 intended to be mounted in the front part of a motor vehicle with its axis transverse the longitudinal axis of the vehicle.The engine 1 includes a gearbox 2 of the type with gears in permanent mesh with each other and having a primary shaft and a secondary shaft also extending transverse the longitudinal axis of the motor vehicle.By 3 is indicated a front differential which is driven by a gear 4 see Figure 2 carried by the secondary shaft 5 of the gearbox 2 through an inter mediate differential 18, and which transmits driving torque to the front wheels of the motor vehicle through two half shafts 6.The transmission system illustrated in Figure 1 further includes a rear differential 7 for transmitting driving torque to the rear wheels of the motor vehicle, which is connected through a transmission shaft 8 to the gear train of the intermediate differential 18 as described in detail below.The front differential 3 and the intermediate differential 18 are housed in a casing 9 joined to the casing of the gearbox 2.The differential 3 is of the known type having a spider 10 which has two stub axles 10a opposite each other and within which are rotatably mounted the half shafts 6 for transmitting driving torque to the front wheels of the motor vehicle. On the ends of the two half shafts 6 which face each other are mounted two side gears 12 which mesh with two side pinions 13 only one of which is seen in Figure 2 which are in turn rotatably supported about a pin 11 fixed to the spider 10.According to the present invention, a toothed wheel 14 is rotatably mounted by means of a roller bearing 15 within the casing 9 containing the front differential 3 and by means of needle rollers 16 about one of the two stub axles 10a of the spider 10 of the front differential 3.In the transmission system according to the present invention, the gear 4 carried by the secondary shaft 5 of the gearbox meshes with an outer crown wheel 17 of the toothed wheel 14 instead of directly with a crown wheel fixed to the spider 10 of the differential as in the known systems.Moreover, according to the present invention, the epicyclic gear train 18 designed to act as an intermediate differential to distribute the driving torque correctly between the front differential 3 and the rear differential 7 of the transmission system is located within the casing 9 containing the front differential 3.The intermediate differential 18 includes a planet carrier 19 having a hub 19a which is mounted for free rotation by means of a roller bearing 20 within the casing 9 containing the front differential 3 and by means of needle rollers 21 about the stub axle 10a of the spider 10 which is opposite to the toothed wheel 14.The planet carrier 19 surrounds the spider 10 and has a flange 19b adjacent to the toothed wheel 14 to which are fixed two pins 22 with their axes parallel to the axis of rotation of the spider 10 and the planet carrier 19.Planets 23 and 23a are mounted for free rotation about the pins 22.A first series of the planets 23 see Figure 5 meshes with an internal crown wheel 24 of the toothed wheel 14, while a second series of the planets 23a meshes with an outer crown wheel 25 of the spider 10, each planet 23a meshing with a corresponding planet 23.Thus, rotation transmitted by the secondary shaft 5 of the gearbox to the toothed wheel 14 by means of the coupling between the gear 4 and the outer crown wheel 17 induces a corresponding rotation of the planet carrier 19 by means of the coupling between the internal crown wheel 24 and the first series of planets 23. The rotation of the planet carrier 19 is thus transmitted to the spider 10 of the front differential 3 by means of the coupling of the second series of planet gears 23a and the outer crown wheel 25.Hence, in the transmission system according to the present invention, the spider 10 of the front differential 3, instead of being connected directly to the gear 4 carried by the secondary shaft 5 of the gearbox is connected to this gear 4 by means of the interposition of the epicyclic gear train 18 which acts as an intermediate differential of the transmission system.A sleeve 26 is mounted by means of a grooved coupling on a hub 19a of the planet carrier 19 of the intermediate differential. The sleeve 26 i s axially displaceable by means of known type not shown between a disengaged position illustrated in Figure 2 in which the planet carrier 19 is free to rotate with respect to the spider 10, and an engaged position illustrated in Figure 3 in which the internal grooved surface of the sleeve 26 is also coupled with the outer teeth of a gear wheel 27 fixed to one of the stub axles 10a of the spider 10 of the front differential 3. In the condition illustrated in Figure 3, the sleeve 26 renders the planet carrier 19 rigid with the spider 10, thus achieving locking of the intermediate differential. To the planet carrier 19 of the intermediate differential is fixed a bevel gear 28 which meshes with a bevel pinion 29 see Figure 4 for transmitting drive to the rear differential 7.The bevel pinion 29 is disposed at one end of a shaft 30 rotatably mounted by means of rolling bearings 31 within a cylindrical extension 32 forming part of the casing 9 containing the front differential The end of the shaft 30 opposite the bevel pinion 29 is connected by means of a constant velocity joint 33 to the transmission shaft 8 for transmitting driving torque to the spider of the rear differential 7. The transmission system according to the present invention allows all round traction to be provided in a motor vehicle having a front mounted engine and gearbox disposed transverse the longitudinal axis of the motor vehicle.Moreover, the system according to the present invention includes an intermediate differential for distributing the driving torque correctly between the front differential and the rear differential, constituted by an epicyclic gear train enclosed within the casing 9 containing the front differential so as not to impair the simplicity and low bulk of the system. The pair of bevel gears 28, 29 for transmitting drive to the rear differential is also housed within the casing for the front differential, again in order to produce a system of low bulk. The said bevel gears are, moreover, preferably of the hypoid type so as to ensure the quietness of the system.Naturally, the principle of the invention remaining the same, the details of construction and embodiments may be varied widely with respect to that described and illustrated, purely by way of example, without thereby departing from the scope of the present invention.
