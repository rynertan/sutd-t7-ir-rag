## Description
This invention relates generally to new immunomodulatory peptides and particularly to analogs of the peptide thymopentin which have greatly increased potency. US A 4,190,646 and US A 4,261,886 equivalent to EP A 0018182 disclose various pentapeptides having activity similar to the long chain polypeptide known as thymopoietin, which is described in US A 4,002,740 and US A 4,077,949. Thymopoietin selectively stimulates the differentiation of T cells. The pentapeptide disclosed in the 646 patent, which has the sequence H ARG LYS ASP VAL TYR OH, is known as the thymopoietin pentapeptide or thymopentin . The biological activity of certain of these peptides is described in an article by M. E. Weksler, et al., J. Exp. Med. 148 996 1006 1978 . US A 4,361,673 and US A 4,420,424 equivalent to EP A 0025897 also disclose various peptides asserted to have activity similar to thymopoietin. A peptide of similar structure isolated from bovine spleen and termed splenin is described in Audhya, Certain enzyme resistant immunomodulatory peptides are disclosed in EP A 0 146 266 The present invention provides peptides and peptide compositions which are surprisingly more potent than thymopentin or splenin and thus offer significant advantages in the treatment of immune defects. The present invention relates to novel peptides having the following formula It has been surprisingly found that the subject peptides possess thymopentin like or splenin like activity at a potency approximately ten times that of thymopentin or splenin itself. The subject peptides wherein W is PRO, dehydro PRO, or AIB also possess surprising resistance to degradation by enzymes, as disclosed in the above referenced European Patent application. As indicated above, this invention is concerned with new peptides having thymopoietin like activity, therapeutic compositions containing these peptides, and methods for use thereof. In its broadest scope, the present invention provides peptides having the following formula As used herein, the term loweralkyl includes branched and straight chain saturated hydrocarbons having from one to six carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, pentyl and hexyl while the term loweralkanoyl means As acids which are able to form salts with these peptides there may be mentioned inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, perchloric acid, nitric acid, thiocyanic acid, sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid and organic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, lactic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, anthranilic acid, cinnamic acid, naphthalenesulfonic acid and sulfanilic acid. As bases which are able to form salts with these peptides, there may be mentioned inorganic bases such as sodium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide and organic bases such as mono , di , and tri alkyl and aryl amines e.g. triethylamine, diisopropylamine, methylamine and dimethylamine and optionally substituted ethanolamines e.g. ethanolamine and diethanolamine . Throughout this diclosure, the amino acid components of the peptides and certain materials used in their preparation are identified by abbreviations for convenience. These abbreviations are as follows The peptides of the invention may generally be prepared following known techniques. Conveniently, the peptides may be prepared following the solid phase synthetic technique initially described by Merrifield in JACS, 85, 2149 2154 1963 . Such methods are also disclosed in certain of the prior art patents referred to above. Other techniques may be found, for example, in M. Bodanszky, et al., The peptides of this invention wherein X is ASP or D ASP have been found to exhibit biological activity similar to thymopoietin, as disclosed in the above referenced United States patents and articles. This biological activity is evidenced by an assay measuring induction of cyclic GMP production in a human T cell line in comparison with thymopoietin. The induction of c GMP production by a test peptide in this assay indicates the ability of the test peptide to bind to the thymopoietin receptor site on the cell and induce thymopoietin like biological activity. As can be seen from the results presented below, the subject peptides are up to about ten times more potent than thymopentin, thus offering a significant advantage. Because of the expense of preparing peptides and the rapid degradation of peptides often observed in living systems, peptides such as those herein which have increased potency are greatly prized. The biological activity of the subject peptides wherein X is ASP or D ASP is also indicated by the binding of these peptides to the cell membrane receptor for the active site of thymopoietin. The peptides of this invention wherein X is GLU or D GLU exhibit biological activity similar to splenin and cause the differentiation of both Thy 1 cells to Thy 1 T cells and Lyb 2 cells to Lyb 2 B cells as shown in the assay of Scheid, Prior to the making of the present invention, it was completely unexpected that one would be able to prepare peptides having such increased potency compared to thymopentin by replacing the amino acid tyrosine in the five position by phenyalanine, histidine, or tryptophan. The references described above generally indicate the necessity of a tyrosine or tyrosine like amino acid residue in position five. There was certainly no suggestion in the art that one could achieve such greatly increased potency by use of the subject peptides. Because of the immunomodulatory characteristics of the subject peptides, they are therapeutically useful in the treatment of humans and animals, since they have the capability for inducing the differentiation of lymphopoietic stem cells in the haemopoietic tissues into thymus derived cells T cells which are capable of involvement in the immune response of the body. As a result, the subject peptides are considered to have multiple therapeutic uses. Primarily, since the compounds have the capability of carrying out certain of the indicated functions of the thymus, they have application in various thymic function and immunity areas. One such application is in the treatment of DiGeorge Syndrome, a condition in which there is congenital absence of the thymus. Administration of one of the subject peptides to a sufferer from DiGeorge Syndrome will assist in overcoming this deficiency. Those of skill in the immunological art can readily determine the appropriate route for administration preferably parenterally and can determine the effective amount of one of the subject peptides for treatment of DiGeorge Syndrome. Because the subject peptides are more potent than thymopentin, they are more therapeutically useful than prior art peptides. Additionally, the subject peptides are considered useful in assisting the collective immunity of the body, in that they will increase or assist in therapeutic stimulation of cellular immunity and thereby are useful in the treatment of diseases involving chronic infection, such as fungal or mycoplasma infections, tuberculosis, leprosy, acute and chronic and viral infections and the like. The subject compounds are generally considered to be useful in any area in which cellular immunity is an issue and particularly where there are deficiencies in immunity such as in the DiGeorge syndrome mentioned above. Thus, where there is an excess of antibody production due to unbalanced T cells and B cells, the subject peptides can correct this condition by stimulating T cell production. Thus, they are expected to be of therapeutic use in certain autoimmune diseases in which damaging antibodies are produced, such as systemic lupus erythematosis and rheumatoid arthritis. The subject peptides wherein X is GLU or D GLU are also useful to induce the differentiation of precursor B cells into mature B cells capable of producing antibody. They are thus useful in treatment of such conditions as X linked infantile hypogammaglobulinemia, where a defect in such differentiation mechanism is present. In their broadest application, the subject compounds are useful for regulating the immune system of a subject, human or animal, in need of such regulation. As used herein, the term regulate means that the subject compounds cause the immune system to return from an abnormal, diseased state to a normal, balanced state. While this regulation may well find great application in the correction of immunological deficiencies e.g. DiGeorge syndrome , it is also applicable to correct conditions of excess immunological activity e.g. autoimmune diseases . The present invention therefore relates to methods for regulating the immune system of a subject in need of such regulation which comprises administering to said subject an immunoregulatorally effective amount of one of the subject compounds, and includes pharmaceutical compositions for practicing these methods. The present invention relates to a method for treatment of conditions resulting from relative or absolute T cell or B cell deficiencies in a subject human or animal having such a condition which comprises administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a peptide of formula I . The invention also relates to a method for treatment of conditions resulting from relative or absolute deficiencies of the thymus of a subject which comprises administering to said subject a therapeutically effective amount of a peptide of formula I . As used herein, the term therapeutically effective amount means an amount which is effective to treat conditions resulting from T cell or B cell deficiencies, or deficiencies of the thymus, respectively. The invention also relates to a method for inducing lymphopoietic stem cells of a subject to develop the characteristics of thymus derived lymphocytes which comprises administering to the subject an effective inducing amount of a peptide of formula I . The invention also relates to a method for inducing precursor B cells of a subject to develop the characteristics of mature B cells which comprises administering to the subject an effective inducing amount of a peptide of formula I . The invention provides pharmaceutical compositions for practicing those methods. To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention, a peptide of formula I or a base or acid addition salt thereof is combined as the active ingredient in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. This carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration, e.g. sublingual, rectal, nasal, oral, or parenteral. In preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as water, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives and coloring agents in the case or oral liquid preparation e.g. suspensions, elixirs, and solutions or carriers such as starches, sugars, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders and disintegrating agents in the case of oral solid preparations e.g. powders, capsules, and tablets . Controlled release forms may also be used. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. If desired, tablets may be sugar coated or enteric coated by standard techniques. For parenteral products, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, although other ingredients to aid solubility or for preservation purposes for example may be included. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared, in which case appropriate liquid carriers or suspending agents may be employed. The subject peptides are generally active when administered parenterally in amounts above about 1 µg kg of body weight. For treatment of DiGeorge Syndrome, the peptides may be administered parenterally from about 0.1 to about 10 mg kg body weight. Generally, the same range of dosage amounts may be used in treatment of the other diseases or conditions mentioned where immunodeficiency is to be treated. Larger amounts e.g. about 10 1000 mg kg body weight are useful for suppressing excess immune activity. The following examples are presented to illustrate the invention without intending specifically to limit the invention thereto.

Thin layer chromatography Silica Gel F₆₀ 200 microns This assay measures the ability of the test peptide to bind to the cell membrane receptor of the intact CEM cell and selectively stimulate production of cyclic GMP, as does thymopoietin itself. The CEM cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 heat inactivated fetal bovine serum, 10 heat inactivated horse serum, 2mM L glutamine, and 50 g ml gentamycin at 37 C in a humid atmosphere containing 5 percent CO₂, to a final density of 3 4 x 10⁶ cells ml. At this concentration, the cells were in the early stationary phase of the growth curve and were judged greater than 90 viable by trypan blue exclusion. The cells were grown for four days and harvested. After harvesting, the cells were washed three times in PBS and were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium at a concentration of 3.12 x 10⁷ cells ml. After the cells had been allowed to equilibrate at 37 C for 30 min, various concentrations of the test peptides were added in a volume of 25 µl of medium to 1 ml of cells, the initial concentration of test compound added being selected to yield the desired final concentration of test peptide in the medium. The test peptide was mixed instantly with the cell suspension. The incubation was allowed to proceed in a shaking water bath at 37 C for 4 5 min and was then terminated by addition of ice cold trichloroacetic acid 10 1 ml . The cells in TCA were then homogenized and sonicated to release cyclic nucleotide. The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 3000 g for 20 min at 4 C and the resulting precipitate was dissolved in 0.1 A conventional competition radioimmunoassay against radio labelled cyclic GMP was conducted to determine the amount of cyclic GMP induced by each concentration of test peptide. Results are shown in Figure 1 and in the following table, in which representative subject peptides have been assayed in comparison with thymopentin designated TP 5 and a nonsense peptide H ASP ARG TYR LYS VAL OH. These results demonstrate the superior potency of the subject peptides compared to thymopentin and also indicate the specificity of the assay for peptides having thymopentin like activity. Other representative compounds demonstrating superior results on this assay were N α acetyl ARG PRO ASP VAL PHE NH₂ N α acetyl ARG AIB ASP VAL PHE NH₂ and N α acetyl ARG 3,4 dehydro PRO ASP VAL TYR NH₂.

Membrane glycoproteins were prepared by a modification of the technique of Hedo, Wheat germ agglutinin or ricinus communis agglutinin I was used for purification of the receptor protein. All lectin beads were stored at 4 C with their corresponding monosaccharide inhibitors 300 mM . For each purification 2 ml of lectin agarose was packed into a 1 cm diameter column and washed at room temperature with 25 ml of 0.15 M NaCl, 50 mM Hepes, 0.1 percent Triton X 1 and 0.01 percent SDS, pH 7.8. The columns were washed with 200 ml of 0.15 M NaCl, 50 mM Hepes and 0.1 percent Triton X 100, pH 7.8, followed by a final wash of this buffer containing 10 mM MgSO₄. PMSF 1 mM was added to all the buffer systems. Solubilized membrane proteins 10 mg were recycled five times through individual columns. The column was then washed with 100 ml of 0.15 M NaCl, 50 mM Hepes, 10 mM MgSO and 0.1 percent Triton X 100, pH 7.8, at 4 C. Monosaccharide inhibitors, at a concentration of 400 mM in 3 ml washing buffer, were used for individual column elutions N acetyl glucosamine for wheat germ agglutinin and β methyl D galactoside for ricinus communis agglutinin I. The monosaccharides were applied to the column, which was stopped for 30 40 min to permit equilibration and then eluted further. The protein eluate was dialyzed against 500 ml of 50 mM Hepes, 10 mM MgSO₄ and 0.1 percent Triton X 100, pH 7.8, at 4 C. The iodinated peptide was dissolved in water and treated with 2 pyridinethiol 1 oxide 10 1 moles for 5 h at room temperature to remove the protecting groups. The deprotected labelled peptide was purified on a Biogel P 10 column. Three radioactive peaks were obtained, the first two of which were immunoactive with rabbit anti thymopoietin antibody. The first peak was then applied to a 1 x 60 cm column of DEAE Sephadex A 25 that had been equilibrated with 50 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.0. The iodination mixture was eluted with this buffer using a linear gradient of increasing ionic strength from the equilibration concentration up to 1.0 M. The radioactivity of each fraction was determined using an LKB 1280 Ultra gamma spectrometer. Fractions with peak radioactivity from each purification scheme were analyzed for binding with excess anti thymopoietin antibody. Fractions from peak II fractions 35 45 of the DEAE Sephedex A 25 column showed the highest specific binding and were used subsequently in the radioreceptor assay. Iodinated thymopoietin retained biological activity as determined by assessing its effect in a neuromuscular assay Goldstein, Nature, The radioactivity in the precipitate in the presence of 1 mg ml nonradioactive thymopoietin was taken to represent nonspecific binding. TCA was added to the supernatant final concentration 5 percent and precipitable radioactivity was measured. At all times this exceeded 95 percent, indicating minimal release of free ¹²⁵I from the tracer. The following representative compounds of the invention caused displacement at least 50 of that caused by thymopoietin self displacement at equivalent concentrations For comparison, other peptides such as insulin, glucagon, growth hormone, somatostatin, β endorphin, FTS, ACTH, CRF, and ubiquitin caused no detectable displacement. The above Examples have been presented for illustrative purposes only and not to limit the scope of the present invention, which scope is set out in the following claims.
