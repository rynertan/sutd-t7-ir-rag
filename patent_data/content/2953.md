# FIBRE REINFORCED PLASTICS AND THEIR PREPARATION

## Abstract
In fibrous reinforced plastics comprising a layer of plastics material having bonded thereto fibrous reinforcement, the reinforcement may comprise a laminate of continuous strand glass fibre mat between chopped strand glass fibre mats, the continous strand layer either containing microspheres or being substantially umcompressed. The plastics layer is preferably a preformed plastics sheet and may be reinforced by a modified vacuum bag moulding technique between a correspondingly shaped moulding area and preformed plastics membrane. Fibrous materials suitable for use in reinforcing plastics are also provided which comprise a fibrous mat, preferably glass fibre, having distributed therethrough microspheres bonded by thermoplastic polymer to the fibres or laminates of continuous strand glass fibre mat between chopped strand glass fibre mats, the continuous strand layer containing microspheres or being substantially uncompressed.
