# Ribbon for non impact thermal transfer printing and manufacturing method thereof.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a ribbon for non impact thermal printing by resistive heating in the ribbon. The resistive substrate of the ribbon comprises a mixture of a thermosetting polyimide, a thermoplastic polyimide, and graphite. It has a steel support layer and an intermediate layer of silicon dioxide. An outer layer on the steel layer is the thermal ink. The mixture is applied as a dispersion with a precursor of the thermosetting polyimide. The ribbon may be recoated at the typing station by applying a hot melt of the ink.
