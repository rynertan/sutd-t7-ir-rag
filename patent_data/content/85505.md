# Electronic ballast system for gas discharge tubes.

## Abstract
In a first embodiment an electronic ballast system is provided for two gas discharge tubes 202, 202 , the ballast system comprising a first transformer 238 powered by an AC source 204 via wave bridge 218 . Transformer 238 comprises primary and secondary wind ings 240 and 242 which establish an oscillating signal. Two transistors 256, 258 are coupled in feed back relation to the transformer for switching a current signal in response to the oscillation signal. Two inverter transformers 210, 212 establish an induced voltage signal responsive to the current signal which is passed to the tubes via capacitors 308, 310 . Capacitance tuning circuits embodying capacitors 312, 314 316, 318 serve to modify the resonance frequency and duty factor of the signal pulse generated by each inverter transformer. In a second embodiment, tube 12 is powered by a ballast system comprising transformer T connected to AC power source 14 via rectifying diode D₁ . Primary winding 22 of transformer T is connected in series with the power source 14 and filament 30 of tube 12 via capacitor C₂ . Secondary winding 24 of transformer T is connected in positive feed back relation with the base 44 and emitter 42 of a transistor Tr . The collector 38 of the transistor Tr is connected to the capacitor C₂ . Second capacitor C₃ is connected in series with the transformer secondary winding 24 to apply a pulse voltage to the second filament 32 of the tube 12 .
