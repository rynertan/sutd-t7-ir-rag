# Electrophotographic plate.

## Abstract
An electrophotographic plate comprising an elec troconductive layer, a charge generating layer and a charge transport layer contains a silane coupling agent at least in the charge generating layer or charge transport layer, or at the interface of the charge generating layer and the charge transport layer. Such plates show small dark decay, little light fatigue and high sensitivity.
