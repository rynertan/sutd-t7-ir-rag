# Digital computer having programmable structure.

## Abstract
Digital computer with a programmable memory organ ization arranged in a bit sliced fashion. The address inputs of the N memories 10 1 to 10 N of the memory structure are operands and opcodes. The N memories 10 1 to 10 N pro vide transformations of the operands, which transformations are defined by the opcodes. The outputs of the memories are applied to the address register 12 of a further control memory 15 that stores con trol words. One portion of the control words retrieved from memory 15 is coupled to the opcode address input of each of the N memories 10 1 to 10 N The operand address inputs of the N memories are derived from registers 12, 14, R‚ÇÅ to R A similar programmable structure can be employed in the data section of the computer.
