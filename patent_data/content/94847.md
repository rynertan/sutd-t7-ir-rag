# ANCHOR ASSEMBLY FOR AN IMPACT ATTENUATION DEVICE

## Abstract
A universal front anchoring system for reusable impact attenuation devices is provided. Buffer elements are posi tioned in an ordered array extending forwardly of a rigid backing member adjacent to a fixed structure. Diaphragm members are interposed in the array and extend laterally outward of the array at fixed intervals. Fender panels are pivotally coupled to laterally extending ends of the di aphragm members and extend rearwardly from their associ ated diaphragm members and partially overlap the fender panels coupled to the succeeding diaphragm members. Nonrigid means such as restraining cables and secondary cables interconnects the backing member and the di aphragm members. A pair of laterally spaced anchor assemblies is connected to the nonrigid means at the forward end of the impact attenuation device. The anchor assemblies are adapted for fixing to the ground and are symmetrical, identical and interchangeable with each other. Preferably, the anchor assemblies have a large central mounting bracket for securing one of the restraining cables and two smaller mounting brackets laterally spaced on opposite sides of the central mounting bracket, one of which is used to secure one of the secondary cables.
