# Fuel injection device.

## Abstract
A fuel injection device in which a fuel injection pump 100 is connected through a fuel injection pipe 400 to a fuel injection nozzle 500 , is improved in that the inner diameter of the fuel injection pipe is rededuced from the side of the fuel injection pump towards the side of the full injection nozzle. The inner diameter of the fuel injection pipe could be reduced from the side of the fuel injection pump towards the side of the fuel injection nozzle either in a stepwise manner or continuously.
