## Description
ACCELERATOR SYSTEM FOR PEROXIDE BASED CURING SYSTEMS Background Of The Invention Proper dispersion and distribution of curing agents in a rubber stock are desirable in order to obtain an efficient and homogenous cure. Although sufficient dispersion can usually be achieved with liquid curing agents, the use of such liquid agent is often inconvenient because of their instability and tendency to phase separate. While these problems can be avoided through use of solid curing agents, it is often essential to adequately subdivide and disperse such solid agents particularly when they are not appreciably soluble in the rubber stock. Exemplary solid curing agents for use with butyl rubber stock include p benzoquinonedioxime and benzoyl peroxide on excipient bases such as calcium phosphate, flour and the like.When such curing systems are used in butyl rubber systems and heated to mild temperatures, below 50 C., the butyl rubber undergoes an excessively slow cure which results in a product having a low cross link density. Therefore, it is often desirable to use an accelerator with such solid dispersed systems. It is an object of the present invention to provide selected quinoid peroxide based curing systems which are capable of yielding fast cure rates at mild temperatures particularly in the presence of selected accelerators. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a curing system capable of yielding fast cures in certain rubber stocks under mild temperature conditions. Therefore the main advantages of the utilization of the curing system of the present invention are as follows 1 energy consumption can be minimized by effecting cure at mild instead of high temperature 2 fast cure cycles are obtained which can translate into faster production times thus resulting in a more efficient, profitable commercial operation and 3 the use of mild temperature curing can enable rubber parts to be produced which have physical properties which are preserved. These properties might have been adversely affected in the past when the parts were subjected to high temperature curing conditions. It is a further object of the present invention to utilize the selected quinoid peroxide based curing systems in the preparation of a puncture sealing layer of puncture sealing tires. Summary Of The Invention It has now been discovered that filled elastomers can be cured at low temperatures utilizing a quinoid peroxide curing system in the presence of a select polar solvent accelerator. The select solvent accelerators which are utilized have the dual function of acting as both dispersing agents and curing accelerators. The instant invention herein includes the instant curing system, its use in a tire sealant composition, the puncture sealing layer formed of the cured composition and the puncture sealing tire.

The total amount of vulcanization agents and or co curing agents which are generally used are amounts ranging from about 0.01 to 20 phr. Quinoid compounds are typically utilized in amounts ranging from about 0.01 to 10 phr. The select polar solvent accelerators described below in detail are typically used in amounts ranging from about 0.1 to 20, preferably about 0.5 to 5 phr.

Utilization of the instant improved rubber curing system is displayed in the following Examples 1 through 30. Preparation of Rubber Masterbatch For Examples A butyl rubber masterbatch was formed from 15 parts by weight of a commercial grade of butyl rubber, 78 parts by weight of polyisobutylene containing 5 parts by weight of a commercially available aliphatic resin tackifier Piccotac B BHT , 7 parts by weight of reinforcing grade carbon black, and 0.55 parts by weight of solid p benzoquinonedioxime. Examination was made on the representative vulcanization system with or without various polar solvent vulcanization accelerators and peroxide curing agents in the following examples. Examples 1 Through 4 and Control 5 Samples of the butyl rubber masterbatch were blended in a Brabender mixer operating at 60 rpm at a stock temperature at 35 400C. Examples 1 through 4 shown in Table 1 display the effect of a select polar solvent, l octanol, upon the curing rate of the butyl rubber masterbatch further containing a peroxide curing agent. Control 5 is a comparative Example displaying the curing of the butyl rubber masterbatch with a peroxide curing agent in the absence of l octanol, the select polar solvent. Examples 6 28 For each of the following Examples 6 28, 100 parts by weight of the butyl rubber masterbatch was charged into a Brabender mixer operating at 60 rpm at ambient temperature. The rubber stock temperatures rose to between 350 and 400C. during mixing. In Examples 6 through 24 a select polar solvent accelerator in an amount of 5.15 parts by weight was added to the rubber stock and mixed for three minutes. Thereafter 7.35 parts by weight ofLUPERCO AA, a peroxide curing agent, was sequentially added to the mixture of rubber and accelerator. The cure onset time, T1, for each mixture was recorded in minutes as the time at which curing occurred after blending. The Brabender mixer registers the torque during mixing of the rubber composition in units of meter grams.The time T2 was then recorded at which the torque measurement increased by 100 metergrams from the lowest torque measurement recorded during mixing of the rubber composition after the addition of both the peroxide curing agent and the select polar solvent accelerator. The cure rate index, T2 T1, was calculated for each select polar solvent accelerator utilized.The results are demonstrated in Table 2. Most of the cured rubber stocks produced in Examples 6 through 23 were given a hot flow test, the results of which are displayed in Table 2.In all hot flow tests, a 0.5 to 0.55 gram sample of cured rubber stock was placed on acetone cleaned, microscope slide inclined at an angle of 300. The distance which the test stock flowed down the glass slide after two hours at 1500C. was nsueed, in rnil limeters. These samples were not post heated and the results are listed in Table 2 under After Mixing as the samples were directly removed from the Brabender mixer. Similarly a 0.5 to 0.55 gram sample of each cured rubber stock was post heated for 30 minutes at 80 C. in an oven and given the same flow test.The results of this test are shown in Table 2 under the column heading Post Heated . Examples 25 through 28 shown in Table 3 display the use of polar solvents which cannot be utilized in the present invention as the Brabender tests displayed a rate cure index greater than 6.0.Plus signs after number in Table 3 display that no further measurements were taken after that time or distance.

The resultant mix was then worked on a two roll mill.The batch was then solution blended in hexane with the remainder of the polybutene and other tackifier if any and was subsequently stripped of solvent in a vacuum oven to produce a dried material. The Peroxide Catalyst was then added to the dried material in the BrabenderPlasticorder at 60 rpm with no external heat. Samples were then oven cured at 80 C. for 15 30 minutes. The above compositions were evaluated for their ability to adhere to a metal surface as might be encountered in the tire by a puncturing nail . Using an Instron Tensile Tester fitted with fixtures designed for the test, the steel probe of the Tester was brought against the surface of a 0.18 inch thick sheet of sealant composition and held at predetermined loading for a specified time before being pulled away from the surface at the various rates as specified below. The energy expended in separating the probe from the sealant was measured and recorded. The data are reported below wherein the separation rate is in terms of speed of the Instron crosshead and the separation energy is in joules, with greater adhesion being indicated by greater separation energy .EMI17.1 tb SEP Separation SEP Rate tb SEP 20 SEP inches tb SEP 2 SEP inches SEP SEP minute SEP minutes tb Compressive SEP Load, SEP Ibs SEP .5 SEP 1 SEP 3 SEP 5 SEP SEP 1 SEP 5 SEP tb Example SEP 29 SEP SEP SEP .25 SEP .211 SEP .33 SEP .41 SEP .51 SEP 1.05 tb Sample SEP 30 SEP .39 SEP .30 SEP .53 SEP .70 SEP .68 SEP 1.61 tb The above data indicates superior adhesion tometal characteristics and is significantly better than is obtained on testing of a commercially available sealant composition. The aforementioned cured material is readily pressed against a tire inside wall to fix it in place to form a puncture sealing tire with a puncture sealing layer with excellent adherence properties and resistance to migration. Typically, the sealant is used to protect the crown area of the tire i.e., the area in back of the tread from shoulder to shoulder . In some cases, it can extend from the middle portion of one of the side walls to the middle portion of the other.In extreme cases, the sealant material can extend from bead to bead on the inner surface of the tire. The compositions of Examples 29 and 30 also demonstrate excellent resistance to migration, puncture filling properties and resistance to blow through after filling and sealing Good results are also obtained when up to 70 of the EPDM is replaced by one or more other networkforming polymers, e.g. polybutadiene, hydrogenated polybutadiene, butyl rubber, halo butyl rubber, acrylonitrile butadiene copolymer, styrene butadiene copolymer, natural rubber, and cis polyisoprene. Good results are also obtained when the polybutene is replaced with other low molecular weight Mn of about 500 to 5000 tackifiers such as ethylenepropylene copolymer, ethylene propylene diene terpolymer, polybutadiene, hydrogenated polybutadiene, butyl rubber, polypropylene, acrylonitrile butadiene copolymer, styrene butadiene rubber and depolymerized natural rubber.
