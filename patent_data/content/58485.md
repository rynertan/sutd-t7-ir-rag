# Metallised medical treatment electrode with insulated border.

## Abstract
An electrode 10 for use in ion therapy comprising a substrate of polymeric fibres 11 coated with at least one layer of an electrically conductive material 12 , wherein an electrically insulating border 21 extends around at least a portion of the periphery of a treatment area 22 of the electrode 10 , whereby diversion of electric current and ions from the treatment area 22 within the electrically insulating border 21 is prevented during use of the electrode 10 . The electrode may be flexible and, also, can be porous. Addi tionally, the border 21 may be impervious to an electrically conductive solution and can be formed by disruption of the electrically conductive coating material 12 and melting of the adjacent polymeric substrate fibres 11 . The invention also comprises a method of fabricating a shaped electrode 10 wherein sufficient heat and pressure are applied around at least a portion of the periphery of a coated substrate to provide the border 21 .
