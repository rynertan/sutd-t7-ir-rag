# Disc brake.

## Abstract
A floating caliper disc brake 10 includes a non rotating torque member 36 . A caliper 22 straddles the brake disc 12 and is carried in fixed radial and circumferential position by the torque member 36 . Axial movement of the caliper 22 relative to the brake disc 22 is provided for by roller members 58 between the caliper 22 and the torque member 36 . The torque member 36 and the caliper 22 both have axially extending grooves 52, 54 which in registry cooperate to define axially extending apertures 56 between the caliper and the torque member. The roller members 58 are received in the axially extending apertures 56 between the caliper 22 and the torque member 36 . The roller members 58 are the sole torque transmitting structure between the caliper 22 and the torque member 36 . Rolling of the caliper 22 on the roller members 58 provides for axial movement of the caliper 22 relative to the brake disc 12 and the torque member 36 .
