## Description
METHOD FOR PRODUCING 3 ALKYLPHENOLS AND 1 ,3 DIHYDROXtLBENZENE This invention relates to the production of aromatic alcohols, and in particular to the selective production of 3 alkylphenols and 1,3 dihydroxybenzene. The present invention provides a process for the production of hydroxybenzene compounds having substituents in the 1 and 3 positions on the benzene ring which comprises A alkylating an aromatic compound with an alkylating agent to produce an isomeric mixture of dialkylbenzene compounds B contacting the isomeric mixture of dialkylbenzene compounds at a temperature of from 15O0C. to 8000C. and a pressure of from 1 xN m2 to 1 x 107 N m2 in the presence of a shape selective zeolite catalyst characterized by a constraint index of from 1 to 12 and by silica to alumina ratio of at least 12 to selectively react the 1,4 dialkyl isomer of the dialkylbenzene compounds to obtain a reaction mixture enriched with respect to the 1,3 dialkyl isomer, C oxidizing the material enriched with respect to the 1,3 dialkylbenzene isomer to obtain the hydroperoxide thereof and D rearranging the hydroperoxide in the presence of an inorganic acid or ion exchange resin to yield a 1,3 disubstituted benzene having at least one hydroxy substituent thereon. The present invention further provides that the alkylation of the aromatic compound may be carried at a temperature of from 100 C. to 400 C. and a pressure of from 1 x 105 N m2 to 4 x io6 N m2 in the presence of a zeolite alkylation catalyst characterized by a silica to alumina ratio of at least 12 and a constraint index of 1 to 12. The organic compound phenol has found many important industrial and medical applications over the years. It is valuable both as an intermediate in the manufacture of other compounds and as a useful material in its own right. Modern manufacturing processes are described in detail in the monograph by A. Dierichs andR. Kubicka, Phenole und Basen, Vorkommen und Gewinnung Akademie Verlag, Berlin, 1958 . 3 Methylphenol is presently used in disinfectants, fumigants, photographic developers and explosives. Its potential as a phenolic resin for adhesives and other industrial products is large, particularly in view of some of the unique characteristics of this particular derivative of phenol, e.g., it is approximately three times more reactive than the parent phenol and has increased toughness, moisture resistance and reduced brittleness, all of which are very desirable properties. However, a major drawback to widened industrial applications for this compound has been its relatively high cost of manufacture. JapanesePatent No. 8929 1955 to Maesawa and Kurakano describes a process for obtaining this compound from coal tar.Its preparation from toluene is disclosed by Toland inU.S. Patent No. 2,760,991. Another process, involving oxidation of o or p toluic acid, is described byKaeding et al. in Ind. Eng. Chem. 53, 805 1961 .However, separation of the 3 methyl compound bp 2020C from the mixed product stream, a necessary step in the heretofore practiced synthetic processes, is at best a very difficult and expensive undertaking. 1,3 Dihydroxybenzene has, like phenol, found numerous uses in both the medical and industrial areas as an intermediate in the synthesis of other materials and also as a useful substanceeby itself. A common method for manufacturing this useful compound has been by fusing 1,3 benzenedisulfonic acid with excess sodium hydroxide. The process of the present invention provides a novel and useful route for the manufacture of both 3 alkylphenols and 1,3 dihydroxybenzene in substantially higher yields than obtained heretofore. The present process is basically a four step process for producing the desired hydroxylated aromatic compound from readily available raw materials such as benzene or alkylated benzene compounds. The first and second steps in the process involve the production of the 1,3 dialkyl isomer of the benzene compound in high yield. Steps three and four comprise the oxidation of at least one of the alkyl substituents on the benzene ring followed by acid catalyzed rearrangement to produce the desired aromatic hydroxy compound and an alkyl ketone by product.

When a known, conventional alkylation catalyst is utilized, the reactants are brought into contact therewith under conditions of temperature and pressure appropriate to that catalyst. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the alkylation catalyst comprises a novel type of crystalline zeolite catalyst characterized by a silica to alumina mole ratio of at least about 12 and a constraint index, as hereinafter defined, within the approximate range of 1 to 12.In such preferred embodiment, the olefin and aromatic compounds are brought into contact with the zeolite, most preferably the crystalline zeolite ZSM 5 or zeolite ZSM 12, at a temperature within the approximate range of from 100 C to 400 C and a pressure of from 1 x 105 N m2 to 4 x 106 N m2, preferably at 200 C to 35O0C. The selective cracking step to remove the undesirable 1,4 isomer, Equation 2 , is accomplished by contacting, under selective cracking conditions, the isomeric mixture resulting from the foregoing alkylation step with a specified type of shape selective crystalline zeolite catalyst having a silica to alumina ratio and constraint index as set out above, whereupon the 1,4 dialkylbenzene is selectively cracked or transalkylated to leave a product enriched in the 1,2and 1,3 dialkyl isomers. The preferred selective cracking conditions comprise a temperature within the approximate range of about 100 C to 500 C and a pressure of approximately 1 x 104 N m2 to 1 x 106 N m 0.1 to 10 atmospheres . The preferred crystalline zeolite catalysts for this step are ZSM 51 ZSM 11 and ZSM 23. The last two steps of the synthesis consist of an oxidation, Equation 3 , and an acid catalyzed rearrangement, Equation 4 , which are analogous to the known commercial process for the production of phenol i.e., where Rub .

The alkylation reaction is carried out by contacting the aromatic and olefinic compounds with an alkylation catalyst, which may be any of the conventional alkylation catalysts loosely classified asLewis and Bronsted acids. The conventional alkylation catalysts utilized herein may be any conventional catalyst designed to promote the alkylation of aromatic compounds with olefins. Such conventional catalysts include those which may be broadly defined as being Lewis and Bronsted acids.A partial listing of materials known to catalyze alkylation of aromatics, which is not intended to be comprehensive of all the catalytic materials utilizable herein, would include AlCl3 AlCl3 HCl AlCl3 H20 AlBr3 FeCl3 SnCl4 TiCl4 ZrCl4 BF3 Et20 PFg H2SO CH3S03H Amberlyst 15 ion exchange resin P205 H3PO4 kieselguhr SiO2 Al203 BF3 Al203 and EtAlCl2sH20. A more complete exposition of alkylation catalysts utilizable in the alkylation step of the present process, along with discussion of suitable reaction parameters for each, may be found in the treatise by G. A.Olah entitled Friedel Crafts andRelated Reactions, Vol. II published by Interscience, 1963 . Broadly speaking, such catalysts will promote the alkylation reaction at temperatures ranging from 50 C to 2O00C and pressures of from 5 x 10 N m2 to 106 N m2 0.5 10 atm. and greater. Preferred reaction conditions include temperatures from 0 C to 150 C and ambient pressure. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the alkylation catalyst utilized herein comprises a specific and novel t ype crystalline zeolite catalyst having unusual alkylation properties. This zeolite catalyst is characterized by silica to alumina ratio of at least about 12 and a constraint index, as hereinafter more fully defined, of from about 1 to about 12. Appropriate reaction conditions include a zeolite catalyst bed temperature between approximately 100C and 400 C and a pressure of from about 105 N m2 to about 4 x 106 N m2, although temperatures of between about 2000C and 35O0C and operating pressures between about 106 and 3.5 x 1Q6 N m2 are preferred.The reactants are most frequently passed across the catalyst, which comprises a bed of particulate material containing a crystalline zeolite catalyst as hereinafter defined, as a continuous stream at a feed weight hourly space velocity WHSV of between about 1 and. about 100. The latter WHSV is based upon the weight of the catalyst compositions, i.e., the total weight of active catalyst and binder therefor. Conta ct between the reactants and the catalyst bed is preferably carried out at a WHSV of from 5 to 12. The crystalline zeolites utilized herein are members of a novel class of zeolites which exhibits unusual properties. Although these zeolites have unusually low alumina contents, i.e., high silica to alumina ratios, they are very active even when the silica to alumina ratio exceeds 30. The activity is surprising since catalytic activity is generally attributed to framework aluminum atoms and or cations associated with these aluminum atoms. These zeolites retain their crystallinity for long periods in spite of the presence of steam at high temperature which induces irreversible collapse of the framework of other zeolites, e.g., of the X and A type. Furthermore, carbonaceous deposits, when formed, may be removed by controlled burning at higher than usual temperatures to restore activity.These zeolites, used as catalysts, generally have low coke forming activity and therefore are conducive to long times on stream between regenerations by burning with oxygen containing gas such as air An important characteristic of the crystal structure of this class of zeolites is that it provides constrained access to and egress from the intracrystalline free space by virtue of having an effective pore size intermediate between the small poreLinde A and the large pore Linde X, i.e., the pore windows of the structure have about a size such as would be provided by 10 membered rings of silicon and aluminum atoms interconnected by oxygen atoms.It is to be understood, of course, that these rings are those formed by the regular disposition of the tetrahedra making up the anionic framework of the crystalline zeolite, the oxygen atoms themselves being bonded to the silicon or aluminum atoms at the centers of the tetrahedra.Briefly, the preferred type zeolites useful in this invention possess, in combination a silica to alumina mole ratio of at least about 12 and a structure providing constrained access to the intracrystalline free space. The silica to alumina ratio referred to may be determined by conventional analysis. This ratio is meant to represent, as closely as possible, the ratio in the rigid anionic framework of the zeolite crystal and to exclude aluminum in the binder or in cationic or other form within the channels. Although zeolites with a silica to alumina ratio of at least 12 are useful, it is preferred to use zeolites having higher ratios of at least about 30. Such zeolites, after activation, acquire an intracrystalline sorption capacity for normal hexane which is greater than that for water, i.e., they exhibit hydrophobic properties. It is believed that this hydrophobic character is advantageous in the present invention. The zeolites useful in this invention have an effective pore size such as to freely sorb normal hexane. In addition, the structure must provide constrained access to larger molecules. It is sometimes possible to judge from a known crystal structure whether such constrained access exists. For example, if the only pore windows in a crystal are formed by 8 membered rings of silicon and aluminum atoms, then access by molecules of larger cross section than hexane is excluded and the zeolite is not of the desired type.Windows of 10 membered rings are preferred, although in some instances excess puckering of the rings or pore blockage may render these zeolites ineffective.Although it is thought that twelve membered rings usually do not offer sufficient constraint to produce advantageous conversions, it is noted that the puckered 12 ring structure of TMA offretite shows constrained access. Other 12 ring structures may exist which may be operative and it is not the intention to judge the usefulness herein of a particular zeolite merely from theoretical structural considerations. Rather than attempt to judge from crystal structure whether or not a zeolite possesses the necessary constrained access to molecules larger than normal paraffins, a simple determination of the Constraint Index, as herein defined, may be made by passing continuously a mixture of an equal weight of hexane and 3 methylpentane over a small sample, approximately one gram or less, of th e zeolite at atmospheric pressure according to the following procedure. A sample of the zeolite, in the form of pellets or extrudate, is crushed to a particle size about that of coarse sand and mounted in a glass tube. Prior to testing, the zeolite is treated with a stream of air at 540oC for at least 15 minutes. The zeolite is then flushed with helium and the temperature adjusted to between 2900C and 5100C to give an overall conversion between 10 and 60 . The mixture of hydrocarbons is passed at 1 liquid hourly space velocity i.e., 1 volume of liquid hydrocarbon per volume of zeolite per hour over the zeolite with a helium dilution to give a helium to total hydrocarbon mole ratio of 4 1. After 20 minutes on stream, a sample of the effluent is taken and analyzed, most conveniently by gas chromatography, to determine the fraction remaining unchanged for each of the two hydrocarbons. The Constraint Index is calculated as follows Constraint Index og10 fraction of hexane remaining log10 fraction of 3 methylpentane remaining The Constraint Index approximates the ratio of the cracking rate constants for the two hydrocarbons.Zeolites suitable for the present invention are those having a Constraint Index of 1 to 12. Constraint Index CI values for some typical. zeolites are Zeolite C.I.

The very nature of this parameter and the recited technique by which it is determined, however, admit of the possibility that a given zeolite can be tested under somewhat different conditions and thereby have different Constraint Indices. Constraint Index seems to vary somewhat with severity of operation conversion and the presence or absence of binders.Therefore, it will be appreciated that it may be possible to so select test conditions to establish more than one value in the range of 1 to 12 for the Constraint Index of a particular zeolite. Such a zeolite exhibits the constrained access as herein defined and is to be regarded as having aConstraint Index of 1 to 12. Also contemplated herein as having a Constraint Index of 1 to 12 and therefore within the scope of the novel class of highly siliceous zeolites are those zeolites which, wh en tested under two or more sets of conditions within the above specified ranges of temperature and conversion, produce a value of the Constraint Index slightly less than 1, e.g., 0.9, or somewhat greater than 12, e.g., 14 or 15, with at least one other value of 1 to 12. Thus, it should be understood that the Constraint Index value as used herein is an inclusive rather than an exclusive value.That is, a zeolite when tested by any combination of conditions within the testing definition set forth hereinabove to have a Constraint Index of 1 to 12 is intended to be included in the instant catalyst definition regardless that the same identical zeolite tested under other defined conditions may give aConstraint Index value outside of the 1 to 12 range. The class of zeolites defined herein is exemplified by ZSM 5, ZSM 11, ZSM 12, ZSM 23, ZSM 35,ZSM 38, and other similar materials. ZSM 5 is more particularly described in U.S. Patent No. 3,702,886., ZSM 11 in U.S. Patent No. 3,709,979, ZSM 12 in U.S.Patent No. 3,832,449, ZSM 23 in U.S. Patent No.4,076,842, ZSM 35 in U.S. Patent No. 4,016,245 andZSM 38 in U.S. Patent No. 4,046,859. The specific zeolites described, when prepared in the presence of organic cations, are substantially catalytically inactive, possibly because the intracrystalline free space is occupied by organic cations from the forming solution. They may be activated by heating in an inert atmosphere at 5400C for one hour, for example, followed by base exchange with ammonium salts followed by calcination at 5400C in air.The presence of organic cations in the forming solution may not be absolutely essential to the formation of this type zeolite however, the presence of these cations does appear to favor the formation of this special class of zeolite. More generally, it is desirable to activate this type catalyst by base exchange with ammonium salts followed by calcination in air at about 5400C for from about 15 minutes to about 24 hours. Natural zeolites may sometimes be converted to this type zeolite catalyst by various activation procedures and other treatments such as base exchange, steaming, alumina extraction and calcination, in combinations. Natural minerals which may be so treated include ferrierite, brewsterite, stilbite, dachiardite, epistilbite, heulandite, and clinoptilolite. The preferred crystalline zeolites are ZSM 5, ZSM 11,ZSM 12, ZSM 23, ZSM 35, and ZSM 38, with ZSM 5 andZSM 12 being particularly preferred for the alkylation reaction of St ep 1 . In a preferred aspect of this invention, the zeolites selected are those having a crystal framework density, in the dry hydrogen form, of not less than about 1.6 grams per cubic centimeter. It has been found that zeolites which satisfy all three of these criteria are most desired for several reasons. When hydrocarbon products or by products are catalytically formed, for example, such zeolites tend to maximize the production of gasoline boiling range hydrocarbon products. Therefore, the preferred zeolites of this invention are those having a Constraint Index as defined above of about 1 to about 12, a silica to alumina ratio of at least about 12 and a dried crystal density of not less than about 1.6 grams per cubic centimeter. The dry density for known structures may be calculated from the number of silicon plus aluminum atoms per 1000 cubicAngstroms, as given, e.g., on Page 19 of the article onZeolite Structure by W. M. Meier in Proceedings of theConference on Molecular Sieves, London, April 1967 , published by the Society of Chemical Industry, London, 1968. When the crystal structure is unknown, the crystal framework density may be determined by classical pyknometer techniques. For example, it may be determined by immersing the dry hydrogen form of the zeolite in an organic solvent which is not sorbed by the crystal. Or, the crystal density may be determined by mercury porosimetry, since mercury will fill the interstices between crystals but will not penetrate the intracrystalline free space. It is possible that the unusual sustained activity and stability of this class of zeolites is associated with its high crystal anionic framework density of not less than about 1.6 grams per cubic centimeter. This high density must necessarily be associated with a relatively small amount of free space within the crystal, which might be expected to result in more stable structures.This free space, however, is important as the locus of catalytic activity. Crystal framework densities of some typical zeolites, including some which are not within the purview of this invention, are Void Framework Zeolite Volume Density Ferrierite 0.28 cc cc 1.76 g cc Mordenite .28 1.7 ZSM 5, 11 .29 1.79 ZSM 12 1.8 ZSM 23 2.0 Dachiardite .32 1.72 L .32 1.61 Clinoptilolite .34 1.71 Laumontite .34 1.77 ZSM 4 Omega .38 1.65 Heulandite .39 1.69 P .41 1.57 Offretite .40 1.55 Levynite .40 1.54 Erionite .35 1.51 Gmelinite .44 1.46 Chabazite .47 1.45 A .5 1.3 Y 1.27 When synthesized in the alkali metal form, the zeolite is conveniently converted to the hydrogen form, generally by intermediate formation of the ammonium form as a result of ammonium exchange and calcination of the ammonium form to yield the hydrogen form.In addition to the hydrogen form, other forms of the zeolite wherein the original alkali metal. has been reduced to less than about 1.5 percent by weight may be used. Thus, the original alkali metal of the zeolite may be replaced by ion exchange with other suitable ions of Groups IB to VIII of the Periodic Table, including, by way of example, nickel, copper, zinc, palladium, calcium or rare earth metals In practicing the desired conversion process, it may be desirable to incorporate the above described crystalline zeolite in another material resistant to the temperature and other conditions employed in the process. Such matrix materials include synthetic or naturally occurring substances as well as inorganic materials such as clay, silica and or metal oxides.The latter may be either naturally occurring or in the form of gelatinous precipitates or gels including mixtures of silica and metal oxides. Naturally occurring clays which can be composited with the zeolite include those of the mdntmorillonite and kaolin families, which families include the sub bentonites and the kaolins commonly known as Dixie, McNamee Georgia and Florida clays or others in which the main mineral constituent is halloysite, kaolinite, dickite, nacrite or anauxite. Such clays can be used in the raw state as originally mined or initially subjected to calcination, acid treatment or chemical modification. In addition to the foregoing materials, the zeolites employed herein may be composited with a porous matrix material, such as alumina, silica alumina, silica magnesia, silica zirconia, silica thoria, silica berylia, silica titania as well as ternary compositions, such as silica alumina thoria, silica alumina zirconia, silica alumina magnesia and silica magnesia zirconia. The matrix may be in the form of a cogel. The relative proportions of zeolite component and inorganic oxide gel matrix on an anhydrous basis may vary widely with the zeolite content ranging from between about l to about 99 percent by weight and more usually in the range of about 5 to about 80 percent by weight of the dry composite. The starting material in the Step 1 alkylation reaction is a monoalkylbenzenes or benzene.The choice of precisely which monoalkylbenzene compound to use as starting material is determined primarily by the desired end product. For instance if one wishes to produce 3 methylphenol m cresol , the appropriate starting material would be methylbenzene toluene , while ethylbenzene would ultimately produce 3 ethylphenol. Any monoalkylbenzene wherein the alkyl substituent contains from 1 to 20 carbon atoms is suitable for the purposes of the present process, although for the manufacture of 3 alkylphenols the most preferred alkyl substituents are those having from 1 to 7 carbon atoms.As a general proposition, the following relationships of alkyl substituents on the benzene ring will be of value in choosing appropriate reactants for the present process relative ease of dealkylation Step 2 EMI17.1 relative ease of oxidation Step 3 EMI17.2 Applying these relationships to the manufacture of an exemplary 3 alkylphenol, e.g. 3 methylphenol, it can be seen that a preferred combination of starting materials might be methyl benzene and propylene to give a product of the Step 1 alkylation reaction comprising EMI18.1 Using the above relationships, it will be clear that the methyl group wil remain firmly fixed i.e. will not dealkylate or oxidize during the subsequent process steps except under the most severe of conditions.During the Step 2 reaction which is more fully described hereinafter, the para isopropyl group will crack off of the ring relatively easily while the meta isopropyl group will remain and be easily and selectively oxidized to the hydroperoxide Step 3 . Monoalkyl benzenes having larger primary or secondary alkyl substituents, i.e. those having from 3 to 5 carbon atoms, are particularly suitable for the production of l,3 dihydroxbenzene resorcinol 1,3 benzenediol . These larger primary or secondary alkyl substituents are more easily oxidized in Steps 3 and 4 of the instant process than are the smaller alkyl groups, although it should be borne in mind that any alkyl substituent, regardless of its size, can be oxidized by the reaction of Steps 3 and 4 if the reaction conditions are of sufficient severity and the reaction permitted to proceed long enough. If the desired end product is l,3 dihydroxybenzene, the most preferred starting material would be isopropylbenzene, which is then alkylated to produce diisopropylbenzene for subsequent oxidation to the desired dihydroxy compound.Similarly, if one wishes to start with benzene, the operating parameters of Step 1 may then be chosen to produce the dialkyl adduct e.g.diisopropylbenzene which will subsequently yield the desired 1,3 dihydroxybenzene. The olefinic component which comprises the alkylating agent of the reaction mixture of Step 1 may be any unsaturated hydrocarbon having from 2 to 20 carbon atoms and at least one olefinic linkage in the molecule. The double bond may be terminal, or it may be internal. Suitable alkylating agents include ethylene, propylene, butene any isomer , pentene any isomer , and cyclohexene. Also, compounds which will, in the presence of the alkylation catalysts defined herein, generate molecules having unsaturated carbon atoms suitable for the alkylation reaction are usable in the instant process.Compounds capable of generating unsaturated carbon atoms, for example are methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, isopropyl ether, and cyclohexyl chlorideStep 2 Selective Cracking EMI19.1 tb SEP ACH2 SEP HA SEP ACHCHA tb SEP zeolite SEP R SEP zR SEP tb SEP catalyst SEP NI tb SEP ACH2CHA SEP R tb SEP i i tb mixed SEP isomers tb where R alkyl A hydrogen or alkyl A hydrogen or alkyl Step 2 of the process comprises contacting the reaction product of Step 1 with a particular crystalline zeolite catalyst, as herein defined, under suitable conversion or transalkylation conditions so as to selectively react and thereby remove the undesirable 1,4 isomer of the alkylated aromatic compound.As in Step 1 , the instant reaction may be carried out in any of a number of physical process eonfigurations, but the preferred embodiment comprises conducting the reaction in a fixed bed catalyst zone. The term suitable conversion or transalkylation conditions is meant to describe those conditions of temperature, pressure and duration of contact between the reactants and zeolitic catalyst which will result in the selective reaction of 1,4 isomer of the alkylated aromatic constituent of the reaction feed mixture, in general but not necessarily exclusive preference to the 1,2 isomer or the 1,3 isomer thereof. It is contemplated that such conditions shall include a catalyst bed temperature of between approximately 100oC and 5000C, operating pressures of from about 104 N m2 to about 106 Nfm2 about 0.1 to 10 atmospheres and WHSV of about 0.1 to about 50.Preferred conditions include a temperature of from about 3000C to about 4500C, pressure between about 5 x 104 N m2 to 5 x 105 N m2 0.5 to 5 atmospheres andWHSV of about 0.5 to 5. The crystalline zeolite catalysts of Step 2 are the same as those defined previously in regard toStep 1 and, as in Step 1 , the preferred catalysts include those designated as ZSM 5 ZSM 11, ZSM 12,ZSM 23, ZSM 35 and ZSM 38. The crystalline zeolitesZSM 5, ZSM 11 and ZSM 23 are particularly preferred for the reaction of Step 2 . In addition, for the purposes of Step 2 , the crystalline zeolites employed may be modified prior to use by combining therewith a small amount, generally in the range of about 0.5 to about 40 weight percent, of a preferably difficultly reducible oxide, such as the oxides of phosphorus, boron or magnesium or combinations thereof and also oxides of antimony. Modification of the zeolite with the desired oxide or oxides can readily be effected by contacting the zeolite with a solution of an appropriate compound of the element to be introduced, followed by drying and calcining to convert the compound to its oxide form. Representative phosphorus containing compounds which may be used include derivatives of groups represented by PX3, RPX2, R2PX, R3P, X3PO, XO 3PO, XO 3P, R3P O, R3P S, RP02, RPS2, RP O OX 2, RP S SX 2, R2P O OX, R2P S SX, RP OX 2, RP SX 2,ROP OX 2, RSP SX 2, RS 2PSP SR 2, and RO 2POP OR 2, where R is an alkyl or aryl, such as a phenyl radical and X is hydrogen, R, or halide.These compounds include primary phosphines, RPH2, secondary phosphines, R2PH and tertiary phosphines, R3P, such as butyl phosphine the tertiary phosphine oxides R3PO, such as tributylphosphine oxide, the tertiary phosphine sulfides, R3PS, the primary phosphonic acids, RP O OX 2, and secondary phosphonic acids, R2P O OX, such as benzene phosphonic acid the corresponding sulfur derivatives such asRP S SX 2 and R2P S SX, the esters of the phosphonic acids such as diethyl phosphonate, RO 2P O H, dialkyl alkyl phosphonates, RO 2P O R, and alkyl dialkylphosphinates, RO P O R2 phosphinous acids, R2POX, such as diethylphosphinous acid, primary, RO P OX 2, secondary, RO 2POX, and tertiary RO 3P, phosphites and esters thereof such as the monopropyl ester, alkyl dialkylphosphonites, RO PR2, and dialkyl alkylphosphinite, RO 2PR esters.Corresponding sulfur derivatives may also be employed including RS 2P S H, RS 2P S R, RS P S R2, R2PSX, RS P SX 2, RS 2PSX, RS 3P, RS PR2 and RS 2PR. Examples of phosphite esters include trimethylphosphite, triethylphosphite, diisopropylphosphite, butylphosphite and pyrophosphites such as tetraethylpryrophosphite. The alkyl groups in the mentioned compounds contain one to four carbon atoms. Other suitable phosphorus containing compounds include the phosphorus halides such as phosphorus trichloride, bromide, and iodide, alkyl phosphorodichloridites, RO PCl2, dialkyl phosphorochloridites, RO 2PX, dialkylphosphinochloridites, R2PCl, alkyl alkylphosphonochloridates, RO R P O Cl, dialkyl phosphinochloridates, R2P O Cl and RP O Cl2. Applicable corresponding sulfur derivatives include RS PCl2, RS 2PX, RS R P S Cl and R2P S Cl. Preferred phosphorus containing compounds include diphenyl phosphine chloride, trimethylphosphite and phosphorus triohloride, phosphoric acid, phenyl phosphine oxychloride, trimethylphosphite, diphenyl phosphinous acid, diphenyl phosphinic acid, diethylchlorothiophosphate, methyl acid phosphate and other alcohol P205 reaction products. Representative magnesium containing compounds include magnesium acetate, magnesium nitrate, magnesium benzoate, magnesium propionate, magnesium 2 ethylhexoate, magnesium carbonate, magnesium formate, magnesium oxylate, magnesium amide, magnesium bromide, magnesium hydride, magnesium lactate, magnesium laurate, magnesium oleate, magnesium palmitate, magnesium salicylate, magnesium stearate and magnesium sulfide. Representative boron containing compounds include boric acid, trimethylborate, boron hydride, boron oxide , boron sulfide, butylboron dimethoxide, butylboronic acid, dimethylboric anhydride, hexamethylborazine, pbenylboric acid, triethylborane, tetramethylammonium borohydride , triphenyl boron, and allylborate. Antimony oxide may also be employed as a modifying component. The antimony oxide is present asSb203 alone or in admixture with other antimony oxides with or without metallic antimony or other antimony compounds being present. In all instances, regardless of the particular state of oxidation of the antimony, its content with respect to the zeolite is computed as if it were present as Sb203. Antimony derivatives which may be used include the hydride SbH3 the halidesSbX3, SbX5 X F, Cl, Br, I organic alkyl and aryl stibines and their oxides R3Sb, R5Sb, RxSb O R alkyl or aryl halogen derivatives RSbX2, R2SbX, RSbX4,R2SbX3, R3SbX2, R4SbX the acids H3SbO3, HSbO2,HSb OH 6 organic acids such as RSbO OH 2, R2SbO OH, all with R and X defined as above noted.Also included are organic ethers such as R2SbOSbR2 esters and alcoholates such as Sb OOCCH3 3, Sb OC4Hg 3, Sb OC2H 3, Sb OCH3 3 and antimonyl salts as SbO S04, SbO N03, K SbO C4H406, NaSbO2 3H20. The zeolite to be modified is contacted with an appropriate compound of the element to be introduced.Where the treating compound is a liquid, it may be used with or without a solvent. Any solvent relatively inert with respect to the treating compound and the zeolite may be employed. Suitable solvents include water and aliphatic, aromatic or alcoholic liquids. Where the treating compound is in the gaseous phase, it can be used by itself or in admixture with a gaseous diluent relatively inert to the treating compound and the zeolite, such as air or nitrogen or with an organic solvent such as octane or toluene. Prior to reaching the zeolite with the treating compound, the zeolite may be dried. Drying can be effected in the presence of air. Elevated temperatures may be employed. However, the temperature should not be such that the crystal structure of the zeolite is destroyed. Heating of the modified catalyst subsequent to preparation and prior to use is also preferred. The heating can be carried out in the presence of oxygen, for example, air. Heating can be at a temperature of about 150 C. However, higher temperatures, e.g. up to 500 C. are preferred. Heating is generally carried out for 1 5 hours but may be extended to 24 hours or longer.While heating temperatures above 5000C. can be employed, they are generally not necessary. At temperatures of about 10000C., the crystal structure of the zeolite tends to deteriorate. The amount of modifier incorporated with the zeolite should be at least about 0.25 percent by weight.However, it is preferred that the amount of modifier be at least about 1 percent by weight when the same is combined with a binder, e.g. 35 weight percent of alumina. The amount of modifiers can be as high as 25 percent by weight or more depending on the amount and type of binder present. Preferably the amount of phosphorus, boron or magnesium oxide added to the zeolite is between 0.5 and 15 percent by weight.Generally, the amount of Sb203 in the composite catalyst will be from 6 to 40 weight percent and preferably from 10 to 35 weight percent. In some instances, it may be desirable to modify the crystalline zeolite by combining therewith two or more of the specified oxides. Thus, the zeolite may be modified by prior combination therewith of oxides of phosphorus and boron, oxides of phosphorus and magnesium or oxides of magnesium and boron. When such modification technique is employed, the oxides may be deposited on the zeolite either sequentially or from a solution containing suitable compounds of the elements, the oxides of which are to be combined with the zeolite.The amounts of oxides present in such instance are in the same range as specified above for the individual oxides, with the overall added oxide content being between 0.5 and about 40 weight percent. Still another modifying treatment entails steaming of the zeolite by contact with an atmosphere containing from 5 to 100 percent steam at a temperature of from 2500 to 10000C for a period of between 0.25 and 100 hours and under pressures ranging from sub atmospheric to several hundred atmospheres to reduce the alpha value thereof to less than 500, and preferably less than 20, but greater than zero. Another modifying treatment involves precoking of the catalyst to deposit a coating of between 2 and 75 and preferably between 15 and 75 weight percent of coke thereon. Precoking can be accomplished by contacting the catalyst with a hydrocarbon charge, e.g. toluene, under high severity conditions or alternatively at a reduced hydrogen to hydrocarbon concentration, i.e. O to 1 mole ratio of hydrogen to hydrocarbon, for a sufficient time to deposit the desired amount of coke thereon. It is also contemplated that a combination of steaming and precoking of the catalyst under the above conditions may be employed to suitably modify the crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite catalyst.

Reaction conditions for oxidation and rearrangement are similar to conditions for the commercial isopropylbenzene phenol process. The oxidation reaction may be conveniently carried out either in batch or continuous operation at 750C up to 1300C and at pressures ranging up to about 106 N m2 10 atm. . An appropriate base, preferably in aqueous solution, is used to maintain the pH of the reaction mixture at 7 to 9 to prevent decomposition of the hydroperoxide. It is also desirable to add a radical initiator to the reaction mix to optimize the conversion rate and selectivity to the desired hydroperoxide.Suitable radical initiators are well known and the most preferable would be an organic hydroperoxide, particularly the same aromatic hydroperoxide which is the desired product of the reaction. However, numerous other conventional radical initiators may suitably be employed e.g., metal oxide catalysts MnO2 . The source of oxygen for the formation of the hydroperoxide is normally an oxygen containing gas e.g., pure 02 or air which is brought into contact with the organic reactants by convenient means, such as continuous bubbling the gas through the reaction mixture under reaction conditions. After formation of the hydroperoxide, it is cleaved and rearranged to the aromatic alcohol by bringing it into contact with an inorganic acid, such asH2S04, preferably at elevated temperature. Alternatively, the hydroperoxide, in suitable solvent, may be converted to the aromatic alcohol by means of a cation exchange resin. Prior to carrying out the rearrangement, it is preferable that the hydroperoxide be separated from the crude reaction product mix, thereby enabling one to maximize the efficiency of the cleavage reaction and also to recycle the unreacted starting materials to increase the yield and efficiency of the hydroperoxidation step. One suitable method of recovering the hydroperoxide would be by crystallization from the crude product mix, but the preferred method comprises extraction with an aqueous base e.g., NaOH followed by treatment of the salt with C02 to regenerate the hydroperoxide. Recycling of the unreacted starting materials, particularly after extraction of the hydroperoxide product, is preferred, especially in continuous operations. However, such recycling may result in an accumulation of essentially inert by products which will act as diluents and thereby prove detrimental to the reaction. It is therefore of benefit to minimize the accumulation of undesirable by products by withdrawing a portion of the recycle prior to returning it to the oxidation reactor. Another method of preventing or minimizing accumulation of by products would be to conduct the oxidation process in a cascade consisting of several reactors. Any or all of the component steps of the process, of this invention may be carried out as a batch type, semi continuous or continuous operation utilizing a fixed, fluidized or moving bed catalyst system. A preferred embodiment entails use of a fluidized catalyst zone wherein the reactants are passed concurrently or countercurrently through a moving fluidized bed of the catalyst. The fluidized bed after use is conducted to a regeneration zone wherein coke is burned from the catalyst in an oxygen containing atmosphere, e.g., air, at an elevated temperature, after which the regenerated catalyst is recycled to the conversion zone for further contact with the aromatic reactants. The process may be carried out in a system wherein the reactants are in either the liquid or the vapor state, and the mixture of olefinic and aromatic compounds may be substantially pure i.e., contain no substantial quantity of hydrocarbon material other than the mixture of the olefinic and aromatic materials or may contain substantial amounts of other hydrocarbon materials. The latter situation would exist when some or all of the feed stream for the instant process also comprises the effluent stream of an earlier upstream process, for instance a process for the commerical manufacture of olefinic or aromatic compounds. Also, the feed stream for the process of this invention may contain other inert materials as diluents or solvents.Suitable diluents include hydrogen, carbon dioxide, methane, ethane, propane and cyclohexane. The following examples illustrate the process of this invention. STEP 1 ALKYLATIONExample 1 A mixture of toluene and ethylene was passed over microcrystalline HZSM 5 zeolite catalyst at 3500C and atmospheric pressure. Two runs were made wherein the molar feed ratios of the toluene to ethylene were 5 and 7.6 respectively. Alkylation occurred to produce,a mixture of ethyltoluene isomers as shown in Table I.

However, by selective cracking i.e., Step 2 , the para isomer may be preferentially dealkylated cracked to produce toluene and light olefins leaving a mixture containing ortho and meta ethyltoluenes.Example 2 A sample of microcrystalline HZSM 5 was steamed for a period of 6 hours at 6000C. A mixture comprising ethylene and toluene was passed over the catalyst at 3500C and atmospheric pressure, with WHSV of 6.96 toluene and 0.54 ethylene . The products are summarized in Table II.

By steaming the catalyst, the production of the ortho isomer was suppressed to below the detection level i.e., 0.1 . By selective cracking, it will be possible to now convert the para isomer to its lower boiling fragments, thereby permitting a separation of substantially pure meta ethyltoluene by a relatively simple distillation.Example 3 The alkylation of toluene with ethylene was carried out at 3000C and atmospheric pressure over HZSM 12 zeolite catalyst. The reactants, at a mole ratio of toluene to ethylene of 7 1, were passed over the catalyst at a feedWHSV of 6. Approximately 60 of the ethylene was converted to alkylation product, with a 90 selectivity to ethyltoluene. The isomer distribution was 40 ortho ethyltoluene, 38 meta ethyltoluene and 22 para ethyltoluene. Example 4 Using the HZSM 12 catalyst of Example 3, toluene was alkylated with propylene mole ratio 7 1 at 2500C and 500 psig. The feed WHSV was 6. Conversion of the alkylating agent propylene was in excess of 95 wt. and the reaction was approximately 95 selective to isopropyltoluene. Isomer distribution was 6 ortho isopropyltoluene, 62 meta isopropyltoluene and 32 para isopropyltoluene. Example 5 Again using HZSM 12 zeolite as the alkylation catalyst, toluene was reacted with a mixture of 1 butene and 2 butene at 2000C. The reaction was carried out at 300 psig and WHSV of 6, the reactants being at a mole ratio toluene to butenes of 7 1. At this temperature the butene conversion was greater than 95 to sec butyltoluene, with isomer distribution being 40 meta and 60 para with no indication of the ortho isomer. This isomer ratio was reversed by increasing the reactor temperature to approximately 235oC. Example 6 Temperature effect on the reaction was studied by alkylating toluene with propylene at 2000, 2300 and 260or over HZSM 12 zeolite catalyst. In all cases the pressure was 500 psig with a molar feed ratio of 6.25 1 toluene propylene. The feed rate for toluene was WHSV 5.7 and for propylene with WHSV was 0.4. The propylene conversion at 2300 2400C averaged 90 95 during a five day run. The selectivity to isopropyltoluene was 95 throughout the temperature range. The effect of temperature on isomer distribution is seen in Table III.

The feed rates for each of the respective components of the feed stream were a WHSV of 7.2 for the ethylbenzene and 0.5 for the ethylene in both runs. An alkylation reaction took place to produce a mixture of diethylbenzene isomers as shown in Table IV.

The reaction was carried out at 2000C and atmospheric pressure, with an ethylbenzene propylene mole ratio of 7 1 and a feed WHSV of 11 over 4.6 grams of HZSM 12 catalyst. The conversion of the alkylating agent was in excess of 95 .Example 9 At 2000C and atmospheric pressure, isopropylbenzene cumene was alkylated with propylene utilizing 4.6 grams of HZSM 12 catalyst. At a WHSV of 11 and a 7 1 mole ratio of isopropylbenzene propylene, greater than 95 of the propylene was converted with 95 selectivity to diisopropylbenzene. The isomer distribution was 60 para and 40 meta. Increasing the reactor temperature to 2350C resulted in a reversal of the meta pa isomer ratio of 61 39. The ortho isomer was not found. Example 10 In another reaction2 analogous to Examples 4 and 6, toluene was alkylated with propylene at 2400C and 500 psig. The catalyst was HZSM 12 zeolite and the feedWHSV and mole ratio toluene propylene were 5.06 0.40 and 5.83 1, respectively. The reaction resulted in a 15.9 mole conversion of the toluene theoretical maximum 17.2 and a propylene conversion of 98.3 99.9 mole .Selectivity to isopropyltoluene was 91.9 based on toluene with an isomer distribution of 5.3 ortho, 63.8 meta and 30.8 para. Step 2 Selective CrackingExample 11 An isomeric mixture of isopropyltoluenes mole ratio para meta ortho 0.45 1.00 0.06 was brought into contact with a ZSM 5 zeolite catalyst which had been prepared according to U.S. Patent No. 3,702,886 and steamed for one hour at 6000C. The reactor was at 3500C and ambient pressure and the feed WHSV for the respective isomers was 1.50 3.36 0.20. The material balance for the reactants and products is given in TableV.

The meta isomer has remained substantially unreacted, with only 2.2 having been converted, while 36.5 of the ortho isomer has been cracked.Example 12 A diisopropylbenzene DIPB mixture containing 68.9 wt. meta isomer and 23.2 wt. para isomer was passed over 4.0 grams of ZSM 5 zeolite catalyst in a quartz microreactor at a feed weight hourly space velocity WHSV of 4.3 and at temperatures of 3000C to 4000C.

Example 13 A mixture containing 52.0 meta ethyltoluene ET , 47.5 wt. para ET and 0.5 wt. ortho ET was contacted with 4.0 grams of the Mg P modified ZSM 5 catalyst in a flow microreactor at 4000 5000C and WHSV of 0.9 6.2.

Oxygen was bubbled through the reactor at 11 liters per hour, while the autoclave was maintained at 120 125 C and 100 psi. A sample was periodically withdrawn for analysis of hydroperoxide formation. When no initiator was added to the reaction mixture, less than 3 meta isopropyltoluene hydroperoxide was formed after 10 hours of oxidation. When a small amount of isopropylbenzene hydroperoxide total weight 0.8 was added as an initiator, oxidation took place smoothly.The change in composition of the rection mixture with time is shown in Table X.

To this solution, 0.5 ml of concentrated H2SO4 was added dropwise to catalyze the rearrangement of the meta isopropyltoluene to 3 methylphenol. The reaction mixture was then heated to 650C for 1 2 hour. The product spectrum is shown in Table XI. As will be seen, the conversion of the meta hydroperoxide was complete. No ortho isopropyltoluene was converted during the oxidation and rearrangement steps into 2 methylphenol.
