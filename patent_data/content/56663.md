# SYSTEM FOR EXTRACTING SUBSURFACE WAVE ENERGY

## Abstract
New and improved methods and means are described for the efficient, expeditious, economical, and safe conver sion to usable form of almost all subsurface wave energy available within a predetermined annular region spanned by an array of submerged wave energy removing impellers mounted upon an annular outrigger surrounding and se cured to a seagoing central platform. Maximal progressive inward attenuation of practically any state of the open sea is achieved over a very broad wave frequency band by buoyant, nonbuoyant, and neutrally buoyant impellers that function approximately as generalized simple pendulums whose natural frequencies fall at regular intervals through out that frequency band. Optimal functioning of the impel lers is achieved by assigning to their working members suitable degrees of omnidirectional response to water movement inertial and drag forces, respectively. After con version by pumps, the extracted wave energy is conveyed via a pressure transmission subsystem to a central turbine for further conversion and subsequent storage and or pro duct processing within the central platform.
