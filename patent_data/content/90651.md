# Semiconductor chip assembly including a thermal radiator plate.

## Abstract
A semiconductor chip assembly comprises a semicon ductor substrate 11 and a radiator plate 15 . An active region 12 is formed on one side of the semiconductor substrate 11 . The radiator plate 15 is bonded to the other side of the semi conductor substrate 11 . A recess 13 is formed on the other side of the substrate 11 to contain the radiator plate 15 to increase thermal coupling between the active region 12 and the plate 15 and to reduce the tendency of the plate 15 and substrate 11 assembly to buckle with changes in tempe rature.
