# Maltodextrin phosphorylase limit dextrin and method of producing it.

## Abstract
Maltodextrin phosphorylase limit dextrin, suitable for forming a reagent composition to be used in an alpha amylase assay, and a method for producing same are described, comprising exhaustively treating a carbohydrate selected from starch, glycogen or to mixtures thereof in an aqueous medium with beta amylase, followed by further treating the so treated carbohydrate with maltodextrin phos phorylase in the presence of organic phosphate and destroying said beta amylase and said phosphorylase after said treatment therewith by heating said aqueous medium.
