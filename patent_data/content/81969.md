# Blends of hardened extract with copolymers of olefin alkyl acrylate.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a blend of an olefin alkyl acrylate copolymer and hardened extract which has a saturated hydrocarbon content of not more than 10 by weight and articles made therefrom, eg linings for reservoirs and for water proofing roofs. The new products are easier to manufacture since they resist gelation, do not suffer from problems of shrinkage and are apprediably cheaper.
