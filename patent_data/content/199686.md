# Method and apparatus for locking the signal from a controlled oscillator to that of a reference oscillator.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for phase locking the signal of a controlled oscillator 1 to that of a reference oscillator 3 , a correction quantity depending on the difference between the relative phase angles of the signals being generated at correction instants for correcting the frequency of the controlled oscillator. According to the invention, said phase lock may also be achieved with a controlled oscillator 1 , having a frequency which is not a whole number multiple of the reference oscillator 3 frequency by the reference oscillator signal or the controlled oscillator signal being phase shifted such that the phase difference occurring at the correction instants as a result of the controlled oscillator frequency not being a whole multiple of the reference oscillator frequency is eliminated at the formation of the correction quantity.
