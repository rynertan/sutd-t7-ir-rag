# Method and apparatus for providing a video display of concatenated lines and filled polygons.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for compactly describing an image made up of concatenated lines or filled polygons. The drawing of lines for the image begins at an initial drawing point determined in a coordinate system defined by a unit screen and proceeds from point to point with the relative coordinates of each successive point specified as a positive or negative step in the horizontal and or the vertical direction from the previous point. The step size parameters which separately define both the amount of a change in the horizontal direction and the amount of a change in the vertical direction are initially specified in fractional parts of the unit screen and remain constant in magnitude through out the operation. The image is reflected about the horizontal axis and about the vertical axis simply by changing the sign of the step sizes. Turning on and off the drawing process is also facilitated.
