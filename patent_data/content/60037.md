## Abstract
An oriented heat sealable polypropylene film comprises a base polypropylene film having on at least one surface at least two layers, the first outer heat sealable layer being a blend of polybutene 1 with polypropylene the polybutene 1 content lying in the range between 30 and 95 by weight and most preferably in the range between 70 and 80 by weight, and the second layer, lying immediately below the first layer, being a polymer having a preponderance of ethylene and or butene 1 units, such as low or high density polyethylene or an ethylene butene copolymer in which ethylene units predominate or polybutene 1 or a butene 1 ethylene copolymer in which butene 1 units predominate. The second layer modifies the sealing properties of the first layer to provide a heat sealable layer having improved hot tack properties and, in some cases, an improved heat sealing threshold temperature.

## Description
HF AT SEALABLE POLYPROPYLENE FILMS, METHODS FOR THEIR MANUFACTURE AND PACXAGES INCLUDING SUCH FILMS This invention relates to heat schlable polypropylene films. Polypropylene film is well known for use as a packaging material. It has high clarity, excellent barrier properties in respect of water vapour and excellent strength particularly when its molecular structure has been oriented by stretching in one or preferably two directions at right angles to each other while subjected to a temperature in the range between 2 C below the crystalline melting point of the polypropylene and its second order transition temperature. Although polypropylene film is inherently heat sealable to itself and is capable of forming heat seals of adequate strength at temperatures of bout 1 C, at such temperatu s and down to about 140 C, oriented polypropylene film will Shrink and produce ndesi ble buckling in the region of the heat Seal. It is known to overcome this distortion problem by forming on one or both surfaces of the oriented polypropylene film a layer of a heatsealable polymer or copolymer capable of forming heat seals of adequate strength at temperatures below the temperature at which heat distortion occurs to any significant extent in the base oriented polypropylene film. Examples of such heat sealable polymers are polyethylene, copolymers of ethylene with propylene or butene 1, copolymers of propylene with butene i, and Surlyn trade mark ionomers. It is most desirable that the heat sealable polymer or copolymers of the heat sealing layer will provide seals of adequate strength that is about 300 grams 38 millimetres of seal width flat jaw sealing when heat sealed at temperatures which are as low as possible without being tacky at ambient temperatures, for example, heat sealing temperatures below about 120 C. There is then a wide temperature range between the minimum heat sealing te perature to give seals of adequate strength the threshold seal temperature and the temperature at which di ortion of the oriented polypropyleJle films takes place.This allows room for temperature drift of heat sealing tools, such as jaws, on high speed packaging machines and for a temperature gradient through the outside layer of the film to the innermost heat sealing layers, without heat distortion of the base polypropylene film taking place. It is also most desirable that the heat sealable polymer or copolymer when heat sealed has immediate strength or tack while hot hot tack properties sufficient to avoid the sealed portions springing apart on retraction of the heat sealing tools and that it has such good hot tack properties over a wide range of temperatures about the threshold seal temperature. We are aware that certain polybutene 1 polypropylene blends when used as a heat sealable layer on oriented polypropylene film have useful threshold seal temperatures but only a limited temperature range over which useful hot tack properties are displayed. However, we have now found that by providing a layer of a polymer having a preponderance of ethylene and or butene 1 units immediately below the heat sealable layer of the polybutenc 1 polypropylene blend, the hot tack properties of the blend are considerably improved together with, in many cases, an improveflent in the thr . old seal temperature of the blend. Thus, in accordance with the present invention an oriented heat sealable polypropylene film comprises a base polypropylene film having on at least one surface at least two layers of which the outer layer comprises a blend of polybutene l with polypropylene in which the polybutene 1 content is from 30 to 95 by weight of the blend and the layer lying immediately below the outer layer comprises a polymer having a preponderance by weight of ethylene and or butenel units. By polypropylene film we mean a film of a homopolymer of propylene or a copolymer of propylene and another monomer such as ethylene in which the propylene content is at least 85 by weight or a blend of polypropylene with a minor proportion by weight of a compatible polyolefin. By polybutene 1 we mean the homopolymer of butene 1 or a copolymer of butene l with a small proportion of a copolymerisible monomer, for example, ethylene. A small proportion in this context will include for instance 2 by weight. The blend of polybutene 1 and polypropylene preferably has a polybutene 1 content lying in the range between 50 Mid 85 by weighty or more preferably in the range between 70 and 8 P o by weight. Examples of suitable polymers having a preponderance of ethylene units are low density and high density polyethylenes, ethylene butene 1 copolymers having greater than 50 by weight of ethylene units,and low density polyethylene resins having carboxylic acids grafted thereto such as are marketed under the trade mark ADMER . These polymers and copolymers are known per se to be useful as heatsealable coating compositions for base polypropylene films but have no, or at least limited, hot tack properties. Examples of suitable polymers having a preponderance of butene 1 units are polybutene 1, and butene 1 copolymers for example butene 1 ethylene copolymers having greater than 50 by weight of butene 1 units. These polymers and copolymers, to, are known to. be useful as heat sealable coating compositions for base polypropylene films and some have good hot tack properties. These promote even better hot tack properties in the blend of polybutene 1 with poly p pylene but tend to give rise to heat sealable polypropylene fil hiving a greater ha ,e than filin employing the polymer and copolyrners having a preponderance of ethyirne units as the layer lying immediately below the outer blend layer. The fjst and second layers may be applied to the base polypropylene film by any of the known methods including co extrusion of melts of the materials, melt extrusion, lamination of preformed films and by stretching preformed films in contact with each other to form a unitary film. The base polypropylene film may be oriented by stretching in one direction or preferably in two directions substantially at right angles to each other either before or after application of the layers. The invention also includes a method of manufacturing an oriented heat sealable polypropylene film having on at least one surface at least two layers as described herein. The invention will now.be illustrated by the following Examples.Example 1 Table 1 shows the results of eight experimental runs. In all the runs a heat sealable oriented polypropylene film was formed by co extruding a melt of polypropylene with a molt of a bend of polybutene 1 and polypropylene in which the polybutene 1 was present in an amount of 75 by weight of the blend. In the control run 1 a two layered film was produced. In runs 2 to 8 a third melt of a polymeric material was, in addition, co extruded between the polypropylene melt and the blend melt to produce a three layered film. All the co extruded films were, in each run, quenched on a chill roller then heated to a temperature of about 100 C before being stretched 5 1 times in the machine direction between t o sets of nip rollers in which the rollers at the output end were rotated at a greater peripheral speed than the rollers at the input end. Each film was then led into a stenter maintained at a temperature of about 15000 and stretched transversely to 9 times its original width. The film was heat set, cooled, trimmed at the edges and wound into a roll. In run 1 the resulting two layered film was about 25 microns thick of which the blend layer was 1 micron thick. In runs 2 to 8 the resulting three layered film was bout 25 micron, thick of which the blend layer and the intermediate polymeric material layer were each 7 micron thick. The threshold sealing temperature and the hot tack temperature range of each of the sainples were determined as followsThreshold Sealing Temperature. Samples of film ,8 mm wide were taken and two pieces were pressed together, blend layer to blend layer, between plain flat rectangular heat sealing jaws measuring 20 x 50 mms.heated to 9000 at a pressure of 1 kg cm2 for a dwell time of 0,8 seconds. The procedure was repeated with fresh samples except that at each repeat the temperature of the jaws was raised by 5 C. The strength of the seal of each of the samples was then measured by determining the force in grams required to peel each element of the sealed samples apart. From these results was determined the lowest sealing temperature at which a sealing strength of 300 grams 38 mm was obtained. This is expressed in the Table as theThreshold Sealing Temperature.Hot Tack Temperature Range. For this measurement a resilient metal blade was used which when bent over upon itself so that the ends touched applied an opening force of 45 grams. A strip of a sample film 50 x,ms wide and of length greater than the blade was laid blend layer downwards along the upper surface of the blade when in a fiat state with the ends protrl2ding beyond the ends of the blade. The blade with sample was then curved over together with the sample on the outside until the ends of the blade and the protruding ends of the sample touched. While the blade was held under tension the protruding ends of the sample were sealed between serrated heat seal jaws 10 x 200 mms at a pressure of 35 kg cm2 for a dwell time of 1 second at 7o C.Just before the jaws opened the blade was released so as to apply a peeling force of 45 grams upon the seal.The seal was said to have acceptable hot tack properties if the seal was peeled open to a depth of not excecdillg 3 mms. The test was repeated with a fresh sample and with an increase of temperature of the sealing jaws by 50C. By further repeats it was possible to determine the range of temperature over which a satisfactory hot tack performance was obtained. The runs 2 to 8 were repeated but with the blend layer omitted so that the intermediate layers of the runs became the heat seal layers. The threshold sealing temperatures and the hot tack temperature ranges were determined as before and entered into the Table. From t we results uf runs 2 to 6 it is seen that layers of polymers having a preponderance of ethylene units beneath the layer of the polybutene 1 polypropylone blend had a significant effect in imploving the hot tack properties of the blend and, in runs 2 to 5, also improved the threshold sealing temperatures of the blend. Run 7 shows that a polymer having a preponderance of butene 1 units beneath the layer of the polybutene 1 polypropylene blend significantly improved the hottack properties of the blend and showed some improvement in the threshold sealing temperature. However the co extruded film was found to be slightly hazy compared with the resultant films of Runs 2 to 6. Run 8 shows that a propylene based polymer layer below the layer of the blend has no effect upon the normal hot tack or threshold sealing temperature of the blend.
