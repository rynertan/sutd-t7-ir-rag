# Fluid flow control valve assembly.

## Abstract
A fluid flow control valve assembly 1 has a housing 2 with first and second ports 3, 4 , and valve means 5 for controlling fluid flow by closing either port or permitting fluid flow between them. The valve means 5 comprises two relatively movable members 6, 7 , a first member 6 for controlling flow through the first port 3 in response to a first spring 18 , a solenoid 9 , and the pressure differential and a second member 7 for controlling flow through the second port 4 in response to the first member 6 , the pressure differential and a second spring 23 .
