## Description
Composition of polyphenylene ethers with core shell rubber modified polystyrene The invention relates to thermoplastic compositions and, more particularly, to thermoplastic compositions comprising a polyphenylene ether resin and a rubber modified polystyrene resin comprising a continuous polystyrene phase containing dispersed particles consisting largely of a core of polystyrene, in a shell of diene rubber membrane, said particles being spherical in shape, highly uniform in size, of from about 0.2 to 0.4 pm , with an average diameter of 0.3 Um , The compositions when molded provide molded articles with substantial and unexpected improvements in impact resistance, or strength, transparency and surface gloss, particularly at low mold temperatures, in comparison with known compositions of rubber modified polystyrenes alone or those of other polystyrenes combined with polyphenylene ethers. The polyphenylene ethers are known and described in numerous publications, including Hay, U.S. PatentNO 3,306,874 and 3,306,875 and Stamatoff, U.S. PatentNO 3,257,357 and 3,257,358, all incorporated herein by reference. They are useful for many commercial applications requiring high temperature resistance and, because they are thermoplastic, they can be formed into films, fibers and molded articles. In spite of these desirable properties, parts molded from polyphenylene ethers have low impact strength. In addition, the relatively high melt viscosities and softening points are considered a disadvantage for many uses.Films and fibers can be formed from polyphenylene ethers on a commercial scale using solution techniques, but melt processing is commercially unattractive because of the required high temperatures needed to soften the polymer and the problems associated therewith such as instability and discoloration. Such techniques also require specially designed process equipment to operate at elevated temperatures. Molded articles can be formed by melt processing techniques, but, again, the high temperatures required are undesirable. For example, while polyphenylene oxide is a tough, temperature resistant engineering polymer, it is difficult to process. It is known in the art that the properties of the polyphenylene ethers can be materially altered by forming compositions with other polymers. For example, U.S. PatentNO 3,379,792 discloses that flow properties of polyphenylene ethers are improved by preparing a composition thereof with from about 0.1 to 25 parts by weight of a polyamide. In U.S.Patent N 3,361,851 polyphenylene ethers are formed into compositions with polyolefins to improve impact strength and resistance to aggressive solvents. In U.S. PatentNO 3,383,435, incorporated herein by reference, there is provided a means to simultaneously improve the melt processability of the polyphenylene ethers and upgrade many properties of polystyrene resins. The latter patent discloses that polyphenylene ethers and polystyrene resins, including many modified polystyrenes are combinable in all proportions to provide compositions having many properties improved over those of either of the components. Preferred embodiments of U.S. Patent NO 3,383,435 are compositions comprising a rubber modified high impact polystyrene and a poly 2,6 dialkyl l,4 phenylene ether. Such compositions are important commercially because they provide both an improvement in the melt processability of the polyphenylene ether and an improvement in the impact resistance of parts molded from the compositions. Furthermore, such compositions of the polyphenylene ether and the rubber modified high impact polystyrene may be custom formulated to provide pre determined properties ranging between those of the polystyrene resin and those of the polyphenylene ether by controlling the ratio of the two polymers.The reason for this is that the composition exhibit a single set of thermodynamic properties rather than the two distinct sets of properties, i.e., one for each of the components of the composition, as is typical with compositions or blends of the prior art. In preferred embodiments of U.S. Patent 1g 3,383,435, rubber modified polystyrenes are used in compositions with polyphenylene ethers because they provide an increase in toughness, e.g., resistance to impact fracture. However, the use of commercially available graft type rubber modified high impact polystyrenes, such as theLUSTREX HT 88 émployed in Example 7 of U.S. PatentNO 3,383,435, causes a sacrifice in transparency, possibly due to scattering of light by the dispersed elastomeric particulate phase in the rubber modified polystyrene.Moreover, the average of such rubber particles are greater in diameter than about 1 um because it has been stated often that if smaller particles are used, impact strength will be lowered. In British Patent NO 1,180,085, it is disclosed that careful attention to the morphology, i.e., the size and nature of the dispersed phase, in copolymers comprising alkyl acrylates and styrene monomers, rendered impact resistant by inclusion of rubber particles, will lead to enhanced impact strength, without loss in transparency, even though very small particles are used. It is suggested in the British patent that the acrylate copolymer should fill the inside of dispersed globular particles, and that such particle should have a thin rubbery membrane or shell surrounding it. The said British patent states, however, that to try the same technique with polystyrene alone is unsuccessful, the product will mold into a material of low impact strength and, also significantly, the resin will be poor in transparency. On page 15 of the British patent, this failure of polystyrene to qualify as a suitable, useful composition is laid, at least in part, to the magnitude of the difference between the refractive index of the rubber component, and the resin, i.e., homopolystyrene, component. Is is stated that such difference must not be in excess of 0.005 refractive index units. Thus the British patent expressly teaches that the only useful compositions must always include an alkyl methacrylate in the thermoplastic matrix and further that there never can be greater than a 0.005 difference in refractive index between that of the rubber and that of the thermoplastic. Moreover, there is no suggestion that such compositions will be useful to modify other thermoplastic resins, and carry their transparency into such modified compositions and, particularly, there is no suggestion to use any such resins, and especially entirely polystyrene based resins, in compositions with polyphenylene ethers. In view of the above, it has now unexpectedly been found that a rubber modified polystyrene in which polystyrene is englobed by a diene rubber membrane and dispersed in spherical particles of highly uniform size throughout a continuous polystyrene phase, while having a diameter of about 0.2 to .0.4pmwith an average diameter of about 0.3ism, will combine with polyphenylene ether resins to give compositions which when molded have higher impact strength, transparency and higher gloss than known blends. The unusual morphology of the rubber modified polystyrene seems to be responsible for the observed advantages. Compositions of polyphenylene ether with a rubber modified polystyrene containing particles in which many polystyrene inclusions are present, are not as tough nor do they have as high a surface gloss. Figure 1 is a transmission electron microphotograph, 30,00 diameters magnification of a section of rubber modified polystyrene, which would not be used in the instant invention, showing the prevailing morphology of the rubber particles in a commercial high impact polystyrene prepared by graft polymerization, such as, a composition known as FG 834 sold byFoster Grant Co. The numerous salami like spots within each particle are due to polystyrene inclusions throughout each particle. The particles are cellular in structure rather than core shell structures. Furthermore, the particles are all ellipsoidal in shape. This is also the case in another rubber modified high impact polystyrene, known as BASF 2790, sold by the BASF Company, of which Figure 2 is a transmission electron microphotograph, 30,000 diameters magnification. This has a core shell structure with an average particle size of about .2 to 0.7 Vm.While BASF 2790 is of the core shell type it contains many particles composed of 2 4 cells. Figure 3 is a transmission electron microphotograph, at 15,000 diameters magnification of a section of a rubber modified polystyrene which is employed in the instant invention. As distinct from BASF 2790, all the particles ofBASF 2791 are single cells. The discontinuous, particulate phase, is seen to consist largely of single particles of polystyrene light areas surrounded by a thin rubber dark area membrane or shell. The core shell or englobed particles are seen to be perfectly spherical in shape and extremely uniform in size, from about 0.2 to 0.4cumin diameter, with an average diameter of about 0.3 ptn.An example of such a rubber modified polystyrene is known as BASF 2791 which is commercially available from the BASF Co. The particles of BASF 2791 are extremely uniform in size, from about 0.2 to 0.4 pm, average estimated about 0.3 pm and are perfectly spherical. Although largely of the core shell type, with polystyrene core surrounded by a rubber membrane, other types of particles are present as well.Some particles consist simply of a solid rubber sphere, some have a rubber sphere at the core, which is surrounded by a thick shell of polystyrene, which is in turn surrounded by a rubber membrane. A few even more complex structures are present spheres of polystyrene with a rubber shell, another shell of polystyrene, and a final shell of rubber.A count of 100 particles in a randomly chosen section of the transmission electron microphotograph showed the following distribution core shell 61 solid rubber spheres 28 clumps of rubber particles 6 rubber polystyrene rubber 7 According to the present invention, in its broadest aspects, there are provided thermoplastic compositions with unexpectedly high impact strength, greatly improved surface gloss and transparency comprising a polyphenylene ether, and a rubber modified polystyrene, the rubber modified polystyrene comprising a continuous polystyrene phase or matrix in which there is uniformly dispersed a discontinuous phase comprising largely of particles of a styrene homopolymer englobulated in a diene rubber membrane, said particles being spherical in shape and uniform in size and having an average size ranging from about 0.2 to about 0.4 pm, with an average diameter of about 0.3pom, and the membrane thickness being not in excess of the diameter of the respective particle.The rubber content will range from about 6 to about 15 by weight of the rubber modified polystyrene component. In general, the compositions according to this invention are prepared by combining said polyphenylene ether and a rubber modified polystyrene to obtain a composition which also has at least two phases, one of which is discontinuous and comprises the rubber englobed polystyrene particles and the continuous phase comprising polyphenylene ether and polystyrene. Such compositions may be molded to shape using conventional molding procedures. According to a preferred aspect of this invention, there are provided high impact strength and improved surface gloss thermoplastic compositions comprising a from 10 to 90 parts by weight of a polyphenylene ether resin and, b from 90 to 10 parts by weight of a rubber modified poly styrene resin, the preferred range being from 20 80 parts by weight of a and 80 20 parts by weight of b . The rubber modified polystyrene contains a disperse phase of particles as described above, of polystyrene englobed with a polybutadiene or rubbery copolymer of butadiene with up to about 60 by weight of polystyrene. Most preferably, in the rubber modified polystyrene component, the rubber will comprise from about 60 to 15 by weight. It has been found that compositions containing about 60 80 of component a are tough and transparent or substantially transparent. Clarity and color are also improved by the addition of c a plasticizing flame retardant, such as a triaryl phosphate. The preferred triaryl phosphate is triphenyl phosphate. Mixed triaryl phosphate with one or more isopropyl groups on some or all of the aryl rings, such as KRONITEX 50 supplied by Food Machinery Corp. In general, the amount of c will be about 5 20 parts by weight per hundred parts phr of components a and b . Methods to determine the morphology of resin systems are well known to those skilled in the art. One convenient method comprises examination of electron microscope photographs of mounted, sectioned specimens. Two such photographs are shown in FIGS. 1 and 2. The techniques are well known to those skilled in the art and are described in Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Technology, Vol. 13,John Wiley Son, Inc. New York 1970 , p. 400, and in references cited therein, as well as in the above mentionedBritish Patent NO 1,180, 085, page 3. In the same references, the standard calculations used to measure average particle size and membrane thickness are also outlined.By inspection also, using, for example, a 1 pm bench mark printed in the electron photomicrographs, such as in FIG. 1 and 2, it is easy to determine whether the discontinuous, dispersed phase meets the size requirements set forth herein. The compositions of this invention generally consist of a mixture of two phases, the continuous phase being a matrix of polyphenylene oxide resin and styrene resin in which there is a discontinuous gel phase dispersed comprising particles of polystyrene englobed with diene rubber membranes of the morphology herein above described, namely, having the particle size and spherical shape and in addition meeting the other above mentioned requirements. It is important that the particles dispersed as shown in FIG. 3, comprise more than 50 and preferably to at least about 60 of the total number of rubber particles. The present compositions are prepared by combining such a rubber modified polystyrene resin with the polyphenylene ether. The particles of the elastomer enveloping polystyrene are provided e.g., by polymerizing styrene in the presence of dissolved rubber under conditions to be specified whereby a continuous phase of such particles becomes dispersed in a polystyrene matrix. The particle size and form in the final composition is kept substantially the same by using blending techniques, e.g., extrusion or milling, which avoid particle degradation. The polyphenylene ethers with which this invention is concerned are fully described in the above mentioned references. The polyphenylene ethers are self condensation products of monohydric monocyclic phenols produced by reacting the phenols with oxygen in the presence of complex copper catalysts. In general, molecular weight will be controlled by reaction time, longer times providing a higher average number of repeating units. A preferred family of polyphenylene ethers will have repeating structural units of the formulaEMI8.1 wherein the oxygen ether atom of one unit is connected to the benzene nucleus of the next adjoining unit, n is a positive integer and is at least 50, and each Q is a monovalent substituent selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, halogen, hydrocarbon radicals free of a tertiary alpha carbon atoms, halohydrocarbon radicals having at least two carbon atoms between the halogen atom and the phenyl nucleus, hydrocarbonoxy radicals and halohydrocarbonoxy radicals having at least two carbon atoms between the halogen atom and the phenyl nucleus. Illustrative members are poly 2,6 dilauryl 1,4 phenylene ether poly 2,6 diphenyl 1,4 phenylene ether poly 2 ,6 dimethoxy 1 ,4 phenylene ether poly 2,6 diethoxy1,4 phenylene ether poly 2 methoxy 6 ethoxy 1,4 phenylene ether poly 2 ethyl 6 stearyloxy 1 ,4 phenylene ether poly 2,6 dichloro 1 ,4 phenylene ether poly 2 methyl 6phenyl 1,4 phenylene ether poly 2,6 dibenzyl 1,4 phenylene ether poly 2 ethoxy 1,4 phenylene ether poly 2 chloro 1,4 phenylene ether poly 2,6 dibromo 1,4 phenylene ether ether and the like. Examples of polyphenylene ethers corresponding to the above formula can be found in the above referenced patents of Hay and Stamatoff. For purposes of the present invention an especially preferred family of polyphenylene ethers includes those having alkyl substitution in the two positions ortho to the oxygen ether atom, i.e., those of the above formula wherein each Q is alkyl, most preferably having from 1 to 4 carbon atorns. Illustrative members of this class are poly 2,6 dimethyl1,4 phenylene ether poly 2 ,6 diethyl 1 ,4 phenylene ether poly 2 methyl 6 ethyl 1 ,4 phenylene ether poly 2 methyl6 propyl 1,4 phenylene ether poly 2,6 dipropyl l,4 phenylene ether poly 2 ethyl 6 propyl 1,4 phenylene ether and the like. The most preferred polyphenylene ether resin for purposes of the present invention is poly 2,6 dimethyl 1,4 phenylene ether. This resin readily forms a compatible and single phase composition with the relevant polystyrene resins over the entire range of combining ratios. Suitable polystyrene matrix resins are derived from a monovinyl aromatic monomer, e.g., one having the formulaEMI9.1 wherein R is hydrogen, lower alkyl, e.g., of from 1 to 4 carbon atoms or halogen Z is hydrogen, vinyl, halogen or lower alkyl and p is O or a whole number of from 1 to 5.Illustrative polystyrene matrix resins include homipolymers of polystyrene polychlorostyrene poly a methylstyrene, polyvinyl toluene and the like, or mixtures of the foregoing. These resins will also comprise the inclusions in the diene rubber membrane envelopes. The most preferred polystyrene is homopolystyrene. The rubber used to envelope the polystyrene resin and provide the disperse phase includes polymeric materials, natural and synthetic, which are elastomers at room temperatures, e.g., 20 to 250C. The term rubber includes, therefore, natural or synthetic rubbers of the diene elastomer type generally used in preparing impact polymers. All such rubbers will form a two phase system with the polystyrene resin, and will comprise the discontinuous phase in the impact resistant polystyrene resin composition.Illustrative rubbers for use in this invention are natural rubber and polymerized diene rubbers, e.g., polybutadiene, polyisoprene, and the like, and copolymers of such dienes with vinyl monomers, e.g., vinyl aromatic monomers, such as styrene. Examples of suitable rubbers or rubbery copolymers are natural crepe rubber, synthetic SBR type rubber containing from 40 to 98 by weight of butadiene and from 60 to 2 percent by weight of styrene prepared by either hot or cold emulsion polymerization, synthetic GR N type rubber containing from 65 to 82 percent by weight of butadiene and from 35 to 18 percent by weight of acrylonitrile, and synthetic rubbers prepared from, for example, butadiene, butadienestyrene or isoprene by methods, employing heterogeneous catalyst systems, such as a trialkylaluminum and a titanium halide, for example.Among the synthetic rubbers which may be used in preparing the present compositions are elastomeric modified diene homopolymers, e.g., hydroxy and carboxyterminated polybutadienes polychlorobutadienes, e.g., neoprenes copolymers of dienes, e.g., butadiene and isoprene, with various comonomers, such as alkyl unsaturated esters, e.g., methyl methacrylate unsaturated ketones, e.g., methylisopropenyl ketone, vinyl heterocyclics, e.g., vinyl pyridine and the like. The preferred rubbers comprise polybutadiene and rubbery copolymers of butadiene with styrene. Such preferred rubbers are widely used in forming rubber modified high impact polystyrene resins with a broad range of properties. A suitable method for preparing the rubber modified polystyrene having particles of the type described above, and used in the present compositions is derived from the general disclosure described by Echte in Angewandte Makromolekulare Chemie 58 59 p. 175 1977 . In general rubber modified polystyrene having particles of the type described above are conveniently prepared by polymerization of solutions in styrene of styrenebutadiene block copolymers having suitable molecular weights and styrene butadiene ratios as described in the aforesaidAngewandte Makromolekulare Chemie publication. Such a polystyrene is one obtained from a diblock copolymer containing 70 butadiene and 30 styrene with a polystyrene block length of 49,000. An example of a rubber modified polystyrene having the morphology herein above described which is employed in the invention is know as BASF 2791 which has been mentioned heretofore. As is described in the above mentioned U.S. PatentNO 3,383,435, polyphenylene ethers and polystyrene resins are combinable with each other in all proportions and they exhibit a single set of thermodynamic properties. The present compositions therefore can comprise from 1 to 99 by weight polyphenylene ether resin and from 99 to 1 by weight polystyrene resin, and these are included within the scope of the invention. In general, compositions in which the polyphenylene ether resin comprises from about 10 to about 90 and the rubber modified polystyrene, by weight of the total resinous components, are preferred because after molding they have the best combination of impact strength, and surface gloss. Particularly useful and preferred are compositions in which the polyphenylene resin component comprises from about 20 to 80 by weight of the combined weight of the total resinous components in the composition. Impact strength and surface gloss appear to be at a maximum in such preferred compositions, and transparency in the range of about 60 80 . The method used to form the compositions of the invention is not critical provided that it permits efficient dispersion and mixing. The preferred method is one in which the polyphenylene ether is mixed with the rubber modified polystyrene using any conventional mixing method and the composition so formed is molded to any desired shape such as by extrusion, hot molding, injection molding, and the like. It should, of course, be obvious to those skilled in the art that other additives may be included in the present compositions such as plasticizers, pigments, flame retardant additives, reinforcing agents, such as glass filaments or fibers, stabilizers, and the like. The advantages obtained by providing compositions of a polyphenylene ether resin and a rubber modified polystyrene of the specified morphology are set forth in the following examples which further illustrate the invention but are not to be construed as limiting the invention. Parts are by weight. The physical tests set forth in the tables are carried out by the following procedures 3,175 mm notched IzodImpact Strength, ASTM D 256 elongation Elong at break,ASTM D 639, tensile yield strength T.Y. , ASTM D 638Heat Deflection Temperature DT , ASTM D 648 GardnerFalling Dart Impact, and Gloss.

The blends containing BASF 2791 were transparent, while the blend containing Foster Grant 834 was almost completely opaque.Properties are listed in the following table PPO PS PS Izod Gardner Appearance 60 40 BASF 2791 2.669 23.01 Transparent 60 40 FG 834 1.501 17.26 Opaque 70 30 BASF 2791 2.456 25.89 Transparent 80 20 BASF 2791 1.975 28.76 Transparent It is thus seen that compositions according to this invention have a greater impact strength, transparency and gloss than that of any of the controls. Other modifications can be made, based on the teachings of the foregoing specific examples. For example, if the procedure of Example I is repeated, substituting for the polystyrene modified with polybutadiene, a polystyrene containing 10 by weight of rubber derived from a rubbery styrene butadiene copolymer containing 60 of butadiene units and 40 of styrene units, by weight, a composition according to this invention will be obtained. If the procedure of the Examples are repeated and the following polyphenylene ethers are substituted for poly 2,6 dimethyl 1,4 phenylene ether in the formulation poly 2,6 diethyl 1,4 phenylene ether poly 2 methyl 6 ethyl 1 ,4 phenylene ether poly 2 methyl 6 propyl 1 ,4 phenylene ether poly 2,6 dipropyl 1 ,4 phenylene ether, and poly 2 ethyl 6 propyl 1 , 4 phenylene ether, compositions according to this invention will be obtained. The compositions of the subject invention can be formed into films, fibers and molded articles. They can be used to make molded products, such as housings, cabinets, frames, for appliances, business machines, etc. pump housings, impellers, filters, and the like. They may be mixed with various fillers and modifying agents, such as dyes, pigments, stabilizers and plasticizers, and the like. All of the foregoing patents and or publications are incorporated herein by references. Obviously, other modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in the light of the above teachings. It is, therefore, to be understood that changes may be made in the particular embodiments of the invention described which are within the full intended scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.
