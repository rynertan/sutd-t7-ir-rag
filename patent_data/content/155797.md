# Treatment of archival material.

## Abstract
A process for the treatment of archival material, more especially entire books and other bound volumes, to im prove the paper structure and provide some protection against degradation, which comprises the radiation induced polymerisation, within the paper, of a vinyl monomer or a monomer mixture comprising one or more vinyl monomers, irradiation being carried out in the presence of the monomer or monomers, and the process being carried out in a substantially non aqueous system. In one preferred embodiment of the process ethyl acrylate is polymerised in the presence of methyl methacry late as yield enhancer in another preferred embodiment ethyl acrylate is used on its own, the treatment being repeated. The polymerisation system may also contain a basic monomer like an amine substituted alkyl methacrylate.
