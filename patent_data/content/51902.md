# Semiconductor integrated circuit incorporating an active device and a distributed resistor capacitor device.

## Abstract
A distributed resistor capacitor device which is highly reproducible with near ideal electrical character istics comprises a doped semiconductor body forming a substrate 108 , an insulative layer 104 on a major sur face of the substrate, and a doped polycrystalline semi conductor material 102 on the insulating layer. The polycrystalline layer 102 is the resistor and co operates with the substrate as the capacitor. The device is in corporated in an integrated circuit together with a field effect transistor 121 or a bipolar junction transistor. The body may comprise a single crystalline silicon sub strate with the layer 104 comprising a silicon oxide. The semiconductor material 102 may be polycrystalline silicon.
