# METHOD FOR PREPARING A ZEOLITE CONTAINING CATALYST

## Abstract
Zeolite containing catalysts and catalyst supports are prepared by forming and drying an aqueous slurry of zeolite, aluminum chlorhydrol and optimally clay to obtain particu late composites in which the zeolite component contains in excess of about 1 percent by weight alkali metal oxide. The particulate composites are calcined, and in some instances ion exchanged to obtain hard, attrition resistant catalytic particles.
