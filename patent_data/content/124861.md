# Light sensitive silver halide color photographic material.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a light sensitive silver halide color photographic material having red sensitive, green sensitive and blue sensitive emulsion layers, each layer consisting of two or more layers with different sensitivities on a support, wherein the layers are constituted so as to satisfy the follow ing requirements A , B , C and D A of the respective emulsion layers having the highest sensitivities among the the red sensitive, green sensitive and blue sensitive emulsion layers, the highest sensitivity blue sensitive emulsion layer is provided in the side farthest from the support B at least the the highest sensitivity red sensitive emulsion layer and the highest sensitivity green sensitive emulsion layer are provided between the the highest blue sensitive emulsion layer and a blue sensitive emulsion layer with lower sensitivity C none of the respective red sensitive, green sensitive and blue sensitive emulsion layers having the lowest sen sitivities exists on the side farther than the low sensitivity blue sensitive emulsion layer from the support and D contained in at least one layer of the high sensitivity red sensitive, green sensitive and blue sensitive layers, is a diffusion resistant compound capable of forming a mobile dye through the coupling reaction with the oxidized product of a chromogenic developing agent. The light sensitive material according to this invention exhibits excellent photographic characteristics such as grain iness, sharpness and sensitivity.
