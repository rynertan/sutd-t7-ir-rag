# Foldable tables and the like.

## Abstract
A foldable article such as a table has an upper surface member 12 having two parts 12a, 12b pivoted together at one edge 14a to allow folding. Two sets of support means 24, 30 extend downwardly. They are arranged to be relatively longitudinally displaced by pivoting of the surface member s parts so that when the article is folded it is supported by one of the support means 24 which bears transport means, e.g. rollers 26 . Pivoting to the erected configuration transfers the support function to the other support means 30 . One of the support means 24 may be tubular with the other received slidably therein. One 30 is pivoted to the surface member 12 adjacent the pivoted edge 14a , while the other 24 is connected to spaced regions of the member 12 by pivoted struts 36 .
