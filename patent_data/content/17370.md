# Coin testing apparatus.

## Abstract
A coin testing apparatus 10 comprises a coin passage way, a coin track 13 along which coins pass on their edges through the coin passageway and an inductor 16 adjacent the coin passageway. The inductor is connected in an oscillating circuit 40 so that the inductor 16 produces an oscillating magnetic field in the coin passageway. Means 44 are provided for examining the maximum shift in the frequency of the oscillating circuit 41 when a coin passes the inductor and detecting whether the shift corresponds with the shift for an acceptable coil. The inductor 16 is oblong and has its major axis perpendicular to the track so that the arrangement is sensitive to variations in diameter over a large range of diameters.
