Therefore, a memory capacity for storing about 200,000 lettes will be needed to store about 30,000 words.In accordance with the present invention, some letters including syllables, hyphens, marks, etc. in each word are all separated so that six types of connection data are assigned and stored to identify the connection between each letter and another to reproduce each full word, whereby the storage data of the words can be compressed in a small capacity.FIG. I shows a table of compressing the letters of the words from JABBER to JERK of TABLE I in ccordance with the present principle.TABLE II is a table indicative of six types of specific symbols used for the present invention although not limited to these examples. Connection Data Symbol starting branch T midway branch ending branch L connecting ending or starting branch ending or connecting TABLE IITABLE III shows the respective meanings of the six types of specific symbols. llT 4 connecting from the left letter to either the right letter, or the latter letter of another word, that is, connecting a high order letter of a word to a low order letter of the word, or braching a high order letter of a first word to a low order letter of a second letter Lcl connecting from the left letter of a word to either the right letter of the same word or the subsequent word, that is, connecting a high order letter of a first word to a low order letter of the same word, or otherwise braching a highorder letter of a first word to a low order letter of a second word L branching from the former letter of a first word to the right letter of a second word, that is, branching a high order letter of a first word to a loworder letter of a second word connecting from the left letter of a word to the right letter of the same word, that is, connecting a highorder letter of a word to a low order letter of the same word terminating at the left letter, or branching from the left letter of a word to either the right letter of the same word or the right letter of a second word, that is, ending the letter chain at a high order letter of a word, or otherwise connecting a high order letter of a word to a low order letter of the same word or branching a high order letter of a first word to a low order letter of a second word terminating at the left letter of a word, or connecting from the left letter to the right letter, that is, ending the letters at a high order letter of a word, or otherwise connecting a high order letter of a word to a low order letter of the same word TABLE IIIIn the above storage system, it can be detected whether the word JACKAL is stored in the memory by detecting the following sequence dependent upon the connection data EMI6.1 A misspelled word JAKAL is not present in the memory because any connection is absent after n 4 n31 4 WTn i An. Another misspelled word JACKAL is not stored in the memory because of the same reason. To store the word letters with the chain correlation as shown in FIG. 1, there will be the following two methods. l The respective storage locations are provided for correlatively storing a great number of pairs of word data and connection data as shown in FIG. 2 and 2 First storage locations a are provided for storing only word data. Second storage locations b are provided for storing only connection data. FIG. 3 shows this. The labels of some parenthesized figures of FIG. 3 are only for the latter explanation.FIG. 4 is a block diagram of the memory circuit according to the present invention.The respective circuit elements are as follows Connection data memory 1 it stores the six types of connection data.Character data memory 2 it stores character data of letters including the data for syllables, hyphens, marks, and the like.Address counter 3 it serves as an address counter for the momories l and 2. It is initially reset to provide an initial address. The same address information is inputted into the memories 1 and 2 so that a connection data and the corresponding character data can be paired and outputted. A signal Sl is applied to the address counter 3 for advancing the address by one to output the next pair of connection data and character data.Checked word memory 4 it stores each checked word which is inputted thereto. It is determined whether the spelling of the checked word is present in the memory circuit or absent so that the word is processed in the word processing machine.A space is inputted and annexed to the end of the letters of the checked word inputted.Address counter 5 it serves for the checked word memory 4. It is initially reset.A signal S2 is inputted into the address counter 5 for advancing the address to provide the next address so that the checked word memory 4 outputs the next word. Counter 6 it is provided for storing that the connection data is ap priate or not.A signal 53 is inputted to it to advance it by one and a signal 54 is inputted to reduce it by one.Decoder 7 it serves to decode the connection data from the connection data memory l. Comparator 8 it is provided for comparing the character from the character data memory 2 with that from the checked word memory 4.Space detector 9 it detects whether each character outputted frw the checked word memory 5 is a space or not.Zero detector 10 it is provided for detecting whether the contents t the counter 6 is zero or not.In FIG. 4, the meanings of the cases for generating respective signals S5 Sl0 are summarized in TABLE IV. S5 indicate that the output of the memory 1 is the starting branch T S6 indicate that the output of the memory 1 is the midway brand S7 indicate that the output of the memory l is the ending branS L S8 indicate that the output of the memory 1 is the connecting S9 indicate that the output of the memory 1 is ending or the starting branch T Slû indicate that the output of the memory 1 is the ending or connecting TABLE IV A word is inputted into the checked word memory 4 to detect whether the word is stored in the memory circuit or not. Based on this detection, the word is processed by the word processing machine.The comparison between the inputted word and the stored word is enabled by composing a full word from the character data of the character data memory 3 and the connection data of the connection data memory I. FIG. 5 is a flow chart of the operation of the memory circuit. In FIG. 5, the double circle represents a detection that the checked word is present. A X circle indicates a detection that the checked word is absent. x is a count of the address counter 3. y is a count of the address counter 5. z is a count of the counter 6.Further, in FIG. 5, A indicates a connection data developed from the connection data memory 1. B represents a character data from the character data memory 2. C is a checked word.TABLE V shows processed contents in the steps. Step Processed Contents nl to reset x, y, and z n5 to add l tox nlO to add l toz nil to subtract 1 from z nl7 to add 1 to x and y TABLE V After YES detection of step n4, the subsequent steps are conducted to retrive the connection data following and T . The following operations are executed after the execution of step n5 has been completed 1 Z 0 a If the output A of the memory 1 is r or , the following operations are conducted nZ l z b If the output A of the memory 1 is , the output of the memory 2 is compared with the character data from the memory 4. If YES is detected, the program can be advanced far from the loop. If NO is detected, an operation of x l x is conducted. c If the output A of the memory l is Ln, the output of the memory 1 is compared with the character data from the memory 4. If YES , the program is advanced far from the loop. If NO , it is detected that the word is absent. 2 zfio a If the output A of the memory l is T or T in step nd, the following operations are executed z 1 z in step n11 Fl nzw in step step nil x 1 n5 b If the output A of the memory l is , an operation of x 1 x is executed c If the output A of the memory 1 is L in step nl4, the following operations are conducted z l z in step n17 x l l is and , an operation of x l 4 x is executed in step n5.For example, a word JAGUAR is retrived as follows Step nl x, y, and y are reset to replace them with zero. At this time, the memories 1, 2, and 4 output T , A and J , respectively.Steps n2 and n3 NO is detected.Step n4 YES is detected to thereby select step n5.Finally, stores 1 of FIG. 3 b , in which y 0 and z 0 . The memories 1, 2, and 4 output , J , and J , respectively. Step n6 NO is detected.Steps n7, n8, and n9 YES is detected.Step nlO this step is conducted for x to select 2 of FIG. 3 b . y becomes 1 .Steps n2, n3, and n4 Since both memories 2 and 4 output A , and the memory l develops T , NO is detected in step n2 and YES is detected in step n3, and NO is detected in step n4. The operation of step n10 is repeated. Here, x selects 3 of FIG. 3 b so that y 2 and the memory l develops T . In steps n2 and n3, NO is detected. In step n4, YES is detected. In step n5, x is increased by one. x becomes to select 4 of FIG. 3 b . The program of step n5 is reselected so that x selects 5 of FIG. 3 b . Because of z 0 , x is continued to be advanced until the memory 1 outputs , , and . In step n5, when x selects 6 of FIG. 3 b , step nll is selected. When x selects 7 of FIG. 3 b , step nil is conducted so that z 2 .After step n5, x selects 8 of FIG. 3 b so that the operation of step nll is conducted. x selects 7 of FIG. 3 b so that the operation of step nil is executed to attain z 2 . After step n5, x selects 8 of FIG. 3 b so that the operation of step n17 is executed to thereby provide z 0. When x selects 10 of FIG. 3 b , step n7 is advanced to step n8. In step nlO, NO is detected. x is further proceeded.When x is 11 of FIG. 3 b , steps n7 n8 n9 are selected. Step n10 is carried out so that y 2 and z 0 . Steps n2 and n3 are checked.Since the memories 2 and 4 both develop G , YES is detected in step n3. The memory 1 generates N , NO is determined in step n13 to thereby repeat the operation of step n10. Then, x selects 12 of FIG. 3 b and won becomes 3 .Because the memories 1, 2, and 3 output G , and U , NO is detected in steps n2 and n3, and YES is detected in step n4, so that x l x is merely conducted. When x selects 13 of FIG. 3 b , NO is steps n6 and n7, and YES is steps n14 and nl5, whereby step n10 is reselected.When x selects 14 of FIG. 3 b , because of y 4 , the memories 1, 2, and 4 develop , A , and A . Therefore, YES is in step n3. At the next stage, YES is detected so that the checked word JAGUAR is completely checked. The operation of step n10 is executed so that x selects 16 of FIG. 3 b to output . y 6 enables U to be outputted. The detection of step n2 is established, but the detection of step n12 does not stand. Here, the double circle of 0 is reached.When the checked word is absent, either of three X circles of is reached.FIG. 6 shows a constitution of a single data unit of connection data and character data. Each connection data is of 3 bits while each character data is of 5 bits, so that the data unit is of 8 bits.In case where the character data and the connection data are aligned as shown inFIGS. 2 and 3, it must be decided where the starting branch, and the ending or the starting branch reach. This is a problem. FIG. 7 shows a drawing of explaining the method to solve this problem. In FIG. 7, each block of L1 indicates two types of connection data of and , and the character data. In other words, the block does not contain The other four types of connection data of T s T F , and L , so that the characters are necessarily connected and teminated midway, but does not branch anymore as follows b3 b4 b5 b2 b 6 4b7 b7 bl b9 Therefore, to retrive some checked word, upon the branch of b2 if the right letter is nut connected Ether, the right side connection data of b6 , b7 , and b8 are reviewed.If some connection can be detected, the character should be connected rightward. When any connection cannot be detected at the right side of b8 ,it is thereby detected that the character is absent in the memory. In order to retrive any connection data from b2 to b6 , the connection data are only checked with proceeding rightward, so as to retrive n and L . If or is detected, the connection data of and L are omitted until the type of connection data nL is detected by the same number.In the example of FIG. 7, the correct connection is attained by searching the types of connection data of n and tt L with omitting the b4 and b5 since the b3 is . tl, FIG. 8 shows another example similar to the situation of FIG. 7.Regarding the checking of the count c as described in FIG. 4, it may take long to increase the count x by one when the capacity of the memory is vast It may be preferred that the leading letter of each checked word inputted into the checked word memory 4 be detected to select an appropriate count for x In the case of JAGUAR as stated above, an additional table is provided for preparing and defining some address values for x to select the connection data memory 1 based on the leading letter J . By operating the following, step n6 of FIG. 5 and the subsequent steps are to directly be selected O z O y After YES in step n4 and YES in step n9 are detected, information representative of the subsequent address or the distance should be added as shown in cl and c2 of FIG. 8 to further become speedy. In the above mentioned preferred embodiment of the present invention, only words are stored. It may be possible that any other information relating to words can be annexed to them. This information may be translated words or part of speech or the like.While only certain embodiments of the present invention have been described, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made therein without departing from the sprit and scope of the present invention as claimed.
