# Self ventilated recirculating airflow system.

## Abstract
A recirculating air system for a disk drive assembly wherein air moves radially over the disk 14 surfaces, over the transducer carriage at an increased velocity, passes the actuator mechanism 30 and through a filter before recircu lation is induced by the hub assembly on which the disks are mounted and which functions also as an impeller. The hub disk assembly also forms an integral part of the drive motor rotor assembly. Also, a breather filter and breather opening 42 communicate with the recirculating air path at the low pressure location of the recirculating path to assure that air entering the system passes through the breather filter,
