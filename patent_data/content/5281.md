# Liquid coating composition based on an ester thiol and an aminoplast, a process for coating a substrate with such a composition, and the substrate thus manufactured.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a liquid coating composition based on an aminoplast and an ester thiol built up from a polyol and a mercaptocarboxylic acid having 2 to 7 carbon atoms. The invention also relates to a process for coating a substrate with such a composition, and to the substrate thus manufactured.
