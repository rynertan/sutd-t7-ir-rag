# Synthetic fibers provided with an irregular surface and a process for their production.

## Abstract
Described are synthetic fibers obtained by plasma irra diating a synthetic fiber containing fine particles, in which recesses and projections are formed on the surface of said synthetic fiber, said projections being composed of the fine particles and the polymer substrate portion constituting said synthetic fiber shielded by said fine particles and thus not etched by plasma, said recesses being composed of the polymer substrate portion unshielded by the fine particles and thus etched, whereby a higher degree of overall ir regularity is achieved. These fibers dyed or after dyeing show a remarkable improvement of the color depth or bril ance. These fibers are in the form of textiles or may be used for preparing textiles of any kind, for example threads, cords, ropes, braids, lace, embroidery, nets and cloth made by weaving, knitting, felting, bonding and tufting.
