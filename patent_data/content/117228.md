Hydrolysis according to b or d is carried out in a manner conventional for such reactions e.g. employing an inorganic hydroxide such as NaOH or KOH with, if desired subsequent acidification to give the free acid form. Suitable solvents are mixtures of water and water miscible solvents such as lower alkanols e.g. methanol or ethanol and reaction conveniently takes place at temperatures from O C to reflux preferably not more than 800C.most preferably 200 to 300C. If it is desired to recover the compound in a salt form corresponding to the cation of the hydroxide employed then slightly less than equivalent amounts of the latter may be employed. In b R14will conveniently be the same as R15 e.g. C1,3alkyl, especially C1,2alkyi, preferably methyl. Ladonisation according to e is carried out in conventional manner e.g. by heating the corresponding acid in an anhydrous inert organic solvent e.g. a hydrocarbon such as benzene, toluene or a xylene or mixtures thereof, preferably at temperatures of 75 C to reflux although more preferably not above 150it. As is evident to those in the art, a racemic threo 3,5 dihydroxycarboxylic acid yields a racemic cis lactone and a racemic erythro 3,5 dihydroxycarboxylic acid yields a racemic trans lactone. Use of a mixture of threo and erythro 3,5 dicarboxylic acid yields a mixture of cis and trans lactones all four possible diastereoisomers . Likewise if a single enantiomer of the 3,5 dihydroxycarboxylic acid is utilized, a single enantiomer of the lactone is obtained. For example, lactonisation of a 3R,5S erythro dihydroxycarboxylic acid yields a 4R,6S lactone. Esterification according to e is conventional employing e.g. a large excess of a compound R140H wherein R14 is as defined above at 20 C to 400C optionally in a solvent especially when R140H is not liquid and in the presence of a catalytic amount of an acid such as k toluenesulfonic acid. Where methyl esters are required these can also be obtained e.g. using diazomethane in an anhydrous inert ether solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, 1,2 dimethoxyethane or 1,2 dlethoxyethane and especially diethylether at e.g. 0 to 30 C preferably 20 to 300C. Examples of protecting groups in reaction c are diphenylt butylsilyl, tri isopropylsilyl or dimethyl t butylsilyl, C16n alkyl, benzyl, triphenylmethyl, tetrahydrofuran 2 yl, tetrahydropyran 2 yl, 4 methoxytetrahydropyran 4 yl, Cl 6n alkanoyloxy. Especially preferred are trisubstituted silyl radicals in particular diphenyl t butylsilyl. Deprotection is carried out in conventional manner e.g. by cleavage under mild conditions such as employing e.g. for removal of a silyl containing group such as diphenyl t butylsilyl a fluoride reagent eog. tetra n butyl ammonium fluoride in an anhydrous inert organic medium preferably tetrahydrofuran containing glacial acetic acid at temperagures of 20 to 60 C especially 20 to 30 C. Preferably 1 5 moles of fluoride are used per mole of silyl group with 1 to 1.8 moles of glacial acetic acid to each mole of fluoride. The required starting materials may be prepared for example as illustrated in the following reaction schemes. The symbols used are defined as followsR, R0, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R5a, R6, R6a, R11, R12, X, as defined above,M2 a cation preferably Na or KR13 C1 6alkyl preferably C1 2alkyl Y chloro or bromoAc acetylEMI20.1 on OCH3 LVI , OOH LVII or O LVIII 3 EMI20.2 these substituents are ortho to each other.

The compounds of formulae Y, XI, XIII, XIV, XVI, XX, XXIII XXV, XXVII, XXXI, XXXIVA, XLI, CI, CXV, CXXIII, CXXIIIA and CXXVIII and the reagents not designated by a Roman numeral are known or, if unknown, may be synthesized by processes analogous to those described in the literature for similar known compounds. As for the compound of formula LV, one isomer is disclosed in Yang et al., TetrahedronLetters 23, 4305 4308 1982 and the synthesis of the other isomers is disclosed in Reaction Scheme IV. The isomer of Yang et al. and the isomer disclosed in Reaction Scheme IY yield lactones having the 4R,6S configuration. Lactones having the 4S,6S configuration may be obtained from the other isomer whose synthesis is disclosed in Reaction Scheme IV. The availability of these intermediates enables synthesis of optically pure end products. Reaction products both intermediale and final can be isolated and purified in conventional mannr whereby intermediates can where appropriately be employed directly in a subsequent reaction Mixtures of stereoisomers cis, trans and optical may be separated by conventional means at whatever stage of synthesis is appropriate. Such methods include re crystalisation, chromatography, formation of esters with optimally pure acids and alcohols or of amides and salts cf also Sommer et al. J.A.C. S. 80, 3271 1958 with subsequent reconversion under retention of optical purity. For example diastereoisomeric a naphthyl phenylmethylsilyl derivatives of a lactone type end product of formula I may be separated by conventional means. Salts may be prepared in conventional manner from free acids, lactones and esters and vice versa. Whilst all salts are covered by the invention pharmaceutically acceptable salts especially sodium, potassium and ammonium particularly sodium salts are preferred. The various forms of the compounds of formula I are by virtue of their interconvertability useful as intermediates in addition to the use set out below. Also within the scope of this invention are the intermediates of formulae YI, XII, XV, XVII, XXVIII XXX, XXXII, XXXIII, XXXY XL, XLII L, LII LIV, LVI LVIII, CXIX CXXII, CXXIY CXXVII, CXXXI and CXXXII.The preferenCeS for each variable are the same as those set forth for the compounds of formula I, With the preferred groups of such compounds including those that correspond t9 Groups i xiii , xxi XXXiii and xli xcii for formulae VI, XII, XV, XVII, XXVIIIXXX, XXXII, XXXIII, XXXV XL, XLII L, LII LIV, CXIX CXXII andCXXIV CXXVII and Groups xiv xx , xxxiv xl and xciii cxx for formula LVI LVIII , to the extent consistent therewith, and the corresponding groups for the compounds of Groups IAa2, IAb2, IBa2,IBb2, IAa3, IAb3, IBa3 and IBb3. The compounds of formula I possess pharmacological activity in particular they are inhibitors of 3 hydroxy 3 methyl glutaryl coenzyme A HMG CoA reductase and as a consequence inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis as demonstrated in the following three tests. Test A In vitro Microsomal Assay of HMG CoA ReductaseInhibition 200 ul. aliquo,ts 1.08 1.50 mg. ml. of rat liver microsomal suspensions, freshly prepard from male,5pargue Dawley rats 150 225 9. body weight , in Buffer A with 10 mmol. dithiothreitol are incubated with 10 ul. test substance dissolved in dimethylacetamide and assayed for HMG CoA reductase activity as described by Ackerman et al., J. Lipid Res. 18, 408 413 1977 . In the assay the microsomes are the source of the HMG CoA reductase enzyme which catalyses the reduction of HMG CoA to mevalonate. The assay employs a chloroform extraction to separate the product, 14C mevalonolactone, formed by the HMG CoA reductase reaction from the substrate, 14C HMG CoA. H mevalono lactone is added as an internal reference.Inhibition of HMG CoA reductase is calculated from the decrease in specific activity 14C H mevalonate of test groups compared to controls. Test B In vitro Cell Culture Cholesterol BiosynthesisScreen The cell culture is prepared as follows Stock monolayer cultures of the Fu5AH rat hepatoma cell line originally obtained from G. Rothblat see Rothblat, Lipids 9, 526 535 1974 are routinely maintained in Eagle s Minimum Essential Medium EMEM supplemented with 10 fetal bovine serum FBS in 75 cmê tissue culture flasks.For these studies, when the cultures reach confluence, they are removed by mild enzymatic treatment with 0.25 trypsin in Hanks balanced salt solution without c alcium and magnesium . After centrifugation of the cell suspension and aspiration of the enzymatic solution, a cell pellet is resuspended in an appropriate volume of media for seeding into 60 mm. tissue culture dishes. The cultures are incubated at 37 C in an atmosphere of high humidity and 5X carbon dioxide. When the cultures are confluent approximately 5 d ays , they are ready for use. The culture media is aspirated from the dishes and replaced with 3 ml of EMEM suplemented with S mg ml of dilipidized serum protein DLSP prepared by the method ofRothblat et al., In vitro 12, 554 557 1976 .Replacement f the FBS with DLSP has been shown to stimulate the incorporation of 14C acetate into sterol by removing the exogenous sterol supplied by the FBS, thereby requiring the cells to synthesized sterol. Enthanced 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl CoenzyTe A reXctase HMG CoA reductase activity is measurable in the cells in response to the lack of exogenous sterol . Following aproximately 24 hours incubation at 37 C in the OLSP supplemented medial the assay is initiated by the addition of 3 Ci of 14C acetate and the test substances solubilized in dimethylsulf3xide DMSO or distilled water.Solvent controls and compactin treated controls are always prepared. Triplicate 60mm. tissue culture dishes are run for each group. After 3 hours incubation at 37 C, the cultures are examined microscopically using an inverted phase contrast microscope. Notations are made of any morphological changes which may have occurred in the cultures. The media is aspirated and the cell layer is gently washed twice with 0.9 sodium chloride solution saline . The cell layer is then harvested in 3 ml. of 0.9 saline by gentle scraping with a rubber policeman and transferred to a clean glass tube withTeflon lined cap. The dishes are rinsed with 3 ml. of 0.9 saline and rescraped, and the cell s are combined with the first harvest.The tubes are ce1Ttrifuged at 1500 r.p.m. for 10 minutes in an IEC PR J centrifug nd the supernatant is asperated. The cells are then extracted as follows One ml. of 100 ethanol is added to the cell pellet followed by sonication for 10 seconds with a LO setting of 50 on a Bronwell Biosonik IV. One hundred l. are taken for protein determination. One ml. of 15 potassium hydroxide KOH is addled, and t he samples are thoroughly vortexed. Saponification is accomplished by heating the ethanol KOH treated sampl es at 60 C for 60 minutes in a water bath. Following dilution of the samples with 2ml. of distilled water, they are extracted three times with 7 ml. of petroleum ether.The petroleum,ether extracts are then washed three times with 2 ml. of distilled water and finally taken to dryness under a stream of nitrogen. The obtained samplessre then analyzed by thin layer chromatography TLC as follows Residues from the petroleum ether extraction are taken up in a small volume of hexane and spotted on silica gel 60 TLC plates E. Merck . Developllent of the plates is carried out in a 150 parts by volume hexane 50 parts by volume diethyl etirer 5 parts by volume galcial acetic acid solvent system using a three phase development procedure.Visualization is accomplished in an iodine vapor chamber. The plates are divided into five sections such that each section contains the molecules havin9 the following approximate Rf values section 1 0 0.4, section 2 0.4 0.55, section 30.55 0.7, section 4 0.7 0.9 and section 5 0.9 1.0. Section 2 contains the non saponifiable sterols. The five sections of theTLC plates are scraped into scintillation vials. Blanks are also prepared from scrapings of chromatographed non labelled standards. ACS scintillation cocktail is added, and the radioactivity is determined in a 1.quid scintillation spectrometer. 14C hexadecane standards are used to determine counting efficiencies.The total protein content of the samples is determined employing the Bio Rad Prtein Assay System. The results are reported as disintegrations per minute per mg protein d.p.m. mg protein for each of the live TLC sections.Mean d.p.m. mg protein standard error of the mean are compared for percentage change and statistical significance with solvent control means. TLC section 2 data is taken as a measure of HMG CoA reductase activity inhibition. Test C In Yivo Cholesterol Biosynthesis Inhibition Tests In vivo studies utilize male llistar Royal Hart rats weighing 150 20 9 which have been kept for 7 10 days on an altered light cycle 6 30 a.m. 6 30 p.m. dark housed two per cage and fed powdered Purina Rat Chow and water ad 7ibitum. Three hours before the diurnal maximum of cholesterol synthesis at mid dark, the rats are administered the test substances dissolved or as a suspension in 0.5 carboxymethylcellulose in a volume of 1 ml 100 g body weight. Controls receive vehicle alone. One hour after receiving the test substance, tne rats are injected intraperitoneally with about 25 Ci 100 g body weight of sodium 1 14C acetate 1 3 mCi mmol. Two hours after mid dark, blood samples are obtained under sodium hexoL rbitol anesthesia and the serum separated by centrifugation. Serum samples are saponified and neutralized, and the 3ss hydroxy sterols are precipiated with digitonin basically as described by Sperry et al., J. Biol. Chew. 187, 97 1950 . The 14C digitondes are then counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. After correcting for efficiencies, the results are calculated in nci nanocuries of sterol formed per 100 ml of serum.Inhibition of sterol synthesis is calculated from the reduction in the nci of sterols formed from test groups compared to controls. The compounds are thus indicated for use as hypolipoproteinemic and anti ath. osclerotic agents. An indicated suitable daily dosage for use in the treatment of pyperlipoproteinemia and athersclerosis is from about 4 to 2000 mg suitably 4 200 e.g. 10 to 100 for the more active compounds suitably administered in divided dosages of 1 to 1000 mg suitably 2.5 to 50 mg two to faur times daily or in retard form. They may be administered in free acid form or in the form of a physiologically hydrolysable and acceptable ester or a lactone thereof or in pharmaceutically acceptable salt form. The invention therefore also concernS a method of treating hyperliproproteinemia or atherosclerosis by administration of a compound of formula I in free acid form or in the form of a physiolo nicallv hvdro7vsable and acceDtable ester or a lactone thereof or inEMI39.1 pharmaceuticals e.g. as hypolipoproteinemic and anti atherosclerotic agents. The compounds may be administered alone, or in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier, and, optionally other excipientS, and administered orally in such fortrs as tablets, elixirs, capsules or suspensions or parenterally in such forms as injectable solutions or suspensions.
