# Location of a structurally damaged membrane.

## Abstract
A structurally damaged membrane in a filter press membrane electrolytic cell is located by electrically discon necting the electrolytic cell 10 from the electrical power source disconnecting and sealing the brine and deionized water infeed 5 40, 38 draining the electrolyte from the electrolytic cell removing from the cell one of the infeed manifolds, i.e. that for a first group of electrode compart ments anolyte 44 or catholyte 42 , filling the electrode compartment of the other group 11 or 12 with a test liq uid, and observing whether, and if so through which mem brane 20 , the test liquid passes to an electrode of the first group 12 or 11 , thereby locating any structurally dam aged membrane.
