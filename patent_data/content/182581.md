## Abstract
A closed circuit breathing apparatus comprising a mouth piece coupled to a counterlung to which oxygen is admitted on demand by the wearer, a medium provided between the mouthpiece and the counterlung to absorb the exhaled carbon dioxide and a chemical heat exchanger in the form of activated carbon to reduce the temperature and relative humidity of the exhaled purified air resulting from the exothermic reaction in the carbon dioxide absorbing medium.
