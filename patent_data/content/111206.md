# Method and apparatus for panel wiping or coating operation.

## Abstract
An apparatus for performing repetitive cycles of panel wiping operation prior to an adhesive coating process, using a programmable manipulator 101 including a manipulator arm 110 movable along a plurality of axes. The apparatus comprises a hand unit 120 carried on the manipulator arm. The hand unit is movable between a chip retain position and a chip release position. A chip supplier 180 supplies a wiping chip to the hand unit for each cycle of panel wiping operation. The hand unit moves to the chip retain position in response to the supply of a wiping chip from the chip supplier and to the chip retain position upon completion of one cycle of panel wiping operation. The manipulator arm is controlled to move so that the wiping chip held with the hand unit can slide on an area of a panel which requires wiping.
