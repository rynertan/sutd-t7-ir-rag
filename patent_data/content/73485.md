# Reinforcement promoters for filled thermoplastic polymers.

## Abstract
A reinforced, filled thermoplastic polymer composition, having increased strength and ductility contains a reinforce ment promoter having at least two reactive olefinic double bonds and a positive promoter index, based on the double bond resonance and polarity, and the promoter adsorbtivity.
