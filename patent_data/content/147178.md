## Description
EXPRESSION PLASMIDS FOR IMPROVED PRODUCTION OF HETEROLOGOUS PROTEIN IN BACTERIA This invention relates to recombinant DNA technology for expressing heterologous proteins in bacteria.More particularly it relates to methods and means for efficient direct expression of prochymosin and mammalian growth hormones in Escherichia coli. Calf rennin chymosin the preferred milk clotting protease for use in cheese production is in short supply. Alternative milk clotting agents namely, frugal proteolytic enzymes have been developed. However, because of their great proteolyctic activity, they tend to reduce the yield of chesse and often give bitter flavors. The economic attractiveness of a steady ana sufficient suppyl of a milk clotting protease has led several investigators to apply recombinant DNA technclogy to the problem. Beppu at al., J. Biochem. 90 901 904 1981 report cloning of the structural gene of prorennin prochymosin in E. colii. In a. subsequent publication, Beppu et al., J. Biochem. 91 1085 1088 1982 , reported the nucleotide sequence of calf prorennin cDNA which they had cloned in E. coli.Construction of an expression plasmid having the lacUVS promoter and its ability to produce a fused protein containing almost all of the prochymosin peptide joined to the short N ten.inal peptide of E. coli Deta galactoscase is described by Beppu at al., Gene 19 337 344 1982 . European Patent Application 73,029 publishedMarch 2, 1983 describes calf pr6rennin DNA containing plasmids, microorganisms E. coli transformed with said plasmids, and their expression of prorennin British Patent Application 2,091,271A, publishedJuly 28, 1982,. discloses methods and agents for producing rennin, prorennin and preprorennin, including the use of various promoters lac, trio, ura3, etc. to obtain expression. One of the disclosed DNA sequences that codes for preprorennin has attached to it a transcriptional promoter and a ribosomal binding site at the 5 end The distance between the beginning of theDNA which codes for preprorennin and the DNA segment carrying the transcriptional promoter and ribosomal binding site is varied. British Patent Application 2,100,737A, publishedJanuary 6, 1983, describes recombinant DNA technology for producing chymosin, methionine chymosin, prochymosin, methionine prochymosin and preprochymosin. Vectors carrying an n. coli tro promoter operator fragment and a transcription terminator, an initiation codon and aShine Dalgarno SD sequence which serves as a ribosome binding site are disclosed. Tnvestigation of the effect of spacing between the SD and ATG sequences is also disclosed. European Patent Application 77,109, publishedApril 20, 1983, describes RNA molecules, i.e., plasmids, comprising genes for preprochymosln and.specific DNA sequences such as a double lac UVS or a modified trp system, and their use to transform microorgamisms lactobacilli, streptococcI, bacillus or yeast to generate transformants which produce preprochymosin in its allelic and maturation forms. European Patent Application 36,776, publishedSeptember 30, 1981 describes expression vectors having the trp promoter operator from which the attenuation region has been deleted, End methods or their produce tion. Transformants carrying said vectors can be grown up in tryptophan rich media so that cell growth proceeds uninhibited by premature expression of heterologous peptide encoded by an insert otherwise under control of the trp promoter operator system. Emtage et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 80 3671 3675, 1983 and European Patent Application 121775 describe contruction of hybrid plasmids carrying prochymosin cDNA and containing thr E. coli trp operon and the use thereof for expression of prorennin at levels greater than those reported by prior investigators.European Patent Application 121775 also describes the effect of variation in the distance separating the SD sequence from the initiation codon for prechymosin and the effect of replacing the N terminal amino acids of prochymosin by peptides of varying length. Harris at al., Nucleic Acids Research 10 21772187 1982 report the cloning and nucleot de sequence of cDNA coding for preprochymosin. Goff at a1., Gene 27, 35 46 1984 describe the expression of calf prochymosin in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a yeast. The restriction endonuclease cleavage map and DNA sequence of preprochymosin cDNA have been published Beppu et al., J. Biochem. 91 0185 1088, 1982 and are incorporated herein by reference. Mammalian growth hormones, including human epidermal growth factor h EGF , are of considerable interest because of their potential to improve animal husbandry.Their general use has been restricted because of their very limited availability. The economic attractiveness of an adequate supply of said hormones hassled several investigators to apply recombinant DNA technology to the problem. Human epidermal growth factor EGF ot urogastrone is not only a stimulator of epidermal tissue growth nut is also a potent inhibitor of gastric acid secretion.The full potential of EGF has not been investigated primarily because of lack of sufficient material. The use of recombinant DNA methodology for the manufacture, cloning and expression of a structural gene for urogastrone and of genes for polypeptide analogs thereof are described in International Patent Application No 83 04030, published November 24, 1983. The cloning of DNA complementary to bovine growth hormone mRNA, the nucleotide sequence thereof and the correspondding. amino acid sequence predicted therefrom are raported by Miller et al., in European PatentApplication 47,600, published March 17, 1983 and J Biochem 255,.7521 7524 1980 , and by Woychik et al. in Nucleic Acids Research 10, 7197 7210 1982 .British Patent Application 2,073,245A, publishedOctober 14, 1981, and Kesket et a1., Nucleic Acids Research 9, 19 30 1981 describe the cloning of bovine growth hormone and its expression in E. coliHB101 as a fused beta lactamase bovine growth hormone protein. Processes for expressing bovine growth hormone gene, plasmids and plasmid hosts for use tnerein are disclosed in European patent Applications 67,026 and 68,64.6, published December 15, 1982 and January 5, 1983, respectively. Each application discloses E. coli as the host organism. The latter application, the counterpart of U.S. Patent 4,443,539 issued April 17, 1984, also divulges SaccharomYces cerevisiae as host organism. Seeburg et al., DNA, 2 37 45 1,983 report the cloning in bacteria of cDNAs prepared using poly A mRNA from bovine or porcine pituitaries and the construction of expression vectors thereform which achieved efficient bacterial production of the mature animal bovine or porcine growth hormones. The technique adopted was analogous to that previously described by Goeddel et al., Nature, 281, 544 548 1979 for direct expression of human growth hormone inE. coli. In each instance the bacterial expression vectors used were under control of the E. coli trp promoter.European Patent Applications Nos. 103,395 and 104,920,, published March 21, 1984 and April 5, 1984 , describe production of bovine growth hormone like polypeptide and production of swine growth hermon like polypeptides, respectively via recombinant DNA methodology. Administration of bovine growth hormone to dairy cows increases milk production and improves the feed intake to milk output ratio Macklin, J. Dairy Science 56, 575 580 1973 3. European Patent Application 85,036A, published August 3, 1983, discloses that biosynthetically produced by rDNA bovine growth hormone and or fragments of it also increase milk production in cows and production of meat, wool, eggs and fur in pigs and other farm animals. U.K. Patent Specification 1,565,190, publishedApril 16, 1980, discloses recombinant plasmid vectors capable of transforming microorganims and containing within their nucledtide sequences subsequences which code for the growth hormone of an animal species. U.S.Patent 4,237,224 describes plasmid vectors for introducing foreign DNA into unicellular organisms Plasmids having a HindIII insertion site for a chosen eukaryotic DNA fragment, said site being adjacent to a bacterial promoter such as the tro promoter, wherein the transcription and translation of the DNA fragment are controlled by the promoter, are described in U.S. Patent 4,349,629 The level of expression of a cloned gene is influenced by a number of factors such as the number of gene copies and the efficiency of transcription and translation.Efficient transcription of an inserted gene requires the presence of a strong promoter and efficient translation requires the presence of a suitable ribosome binding site in the mRNA and appropriate spacing between the rbs and the translation initiation codon. The promoter precedes that portion of the DNA structural gene which codes for a protein. The ribosome binding site rbs , or ribosome recognition sequence, is believed to consist of a sequence at least 3 9 bp long, known as the Shine Dalgarno SD sequence.It begins 3 to 11 bp upstream from .e AUG which encodes the amino terminal methionine of the protein Guarante et al., Cell 20 543 553, 1980 , and is complementary to the 3 terminal sequence of 16S RNA. The separation of the promoter from the translational start signal AUG for a cene can markedly affect the levels of protein produced Guarante et al., loc. cit. and references cited therein . This reference and Ptashne et al., U.S. Patent 4,332,892 issued June 1, 1982 describe the effects of placing a portable promoter fragment at .varying distances from the 5 end of a gene upon expression. Other references relevant to the effect of defined alterations of nucleotide sequences and especially of variations between the SD region and the start coon are Scherer et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 8 3895 3907 1980 Shepard et al., DNA 1 125 131 1982 Windass et al., Nucl. Acids Res. ld 6639 6657 1982 De Boer et al., DNA 2 231 235 1983 Tacon et al., Molec.gen. Genet. 177, 427 438 1980 and Itoh et al., DNA 3, 157 165 1984 . This invention relates to a promoter rbs expression element or general utility for high level heterologous gene expression, to expression plasmids carrying said expression element for d erect expression of neterologous proteins prokaryotic or eukaryotic and which, when introduced into competent bacteria, produce recombinant microorganisms capable of expressing unexpectedly ana surprisingly high levels of said proteins to methods for their construction recombinant r, coli, especially transformants, comprising said plasmids and the use iof said recombinant microorganisms to produce said heterologous prcteins. More particularly it relates to high level expression by E. coli of heterologous genes encoding for proteins such as prochymosin and mammalian growth hormones such as bovine and porcine growth hormones and human epidermal growth factor anc especially to expression plasmids useful therefor.Said plasmids comprise a selectable marker a replication, i.e., a DNA sequence which comprises a region to control autonomous replication in the host cell and the E. coli trp promoter joined to said heterologous protein cDNA sequence gene by a synthetic DNA linker1 said plasmid comprising a novel ribosome binding region which may be of variable length. A feature of the plasmid of this invention is the presence, in the ribosome binding region upstream from the ATG initiation codon, of the nucleotide sequences 5 TAAAAAGGAGAATTCATG 3 or 5 TAAAAAGGGTATCGAGAATTC ATG 3 . A preferred expression plasmid of this invention has the additional and significant feature of a translational stop codon TAA in the same reading frame as the protein coding sequence just prior to the Shine Dalgarno sequence. The state of the art of molecular biology is at a sufficiently developed level such that in vitro construction cf hybrid plasmids which should express a given protein or polypeptide is possible from a knowledge of the cDNA sequence which encodes said polypeptide and the restriction endonuclease cleavage map of said sequence. However, despite this, there is no basis in the art to suggest that a particular, and even critical, arrangement of the DNA sequence within z plasmia will, when suitably introduced into a microorganism, afford significant and unexpectedly high expression of the polypeptide. The herein described recombinant microorganisms express heterologous proteins in significantly greater yields than do previously described microorganisms and achieve, for the first time, their economic production via recombinant DNA technology. A,s those skilled in the art will recognize, recombinant microorganisms can be produced by a number of methods, e.g. transformation, transduction, con jugation,or transfection. It is, therefore, intended to include in the term recombinant microorganisms microorganisms which are capable of expressing the herein described heterologous proteins whenever said microorganisms are prepared by any of the abovementioned methods.To put it another way, the defintion of recombinant microorganism as used herein includes any microorganism capable of expressing the heterologous protein of a heterogenic or xenogenic sequence whenever said microorganism is prepared by recombinant techniques. Another object of this invention comprises the nucleotide sequences described herein for the ribosome binding site of a gene encoding a prokaryotic or eukaryotic,protein which when inserted into a bacterial plasmid downstream from a transcriptional promoter sequence affords efficient expression in E. coli. The ribosome binding site regions described contain a con venient EcoRi ,restriction endonuclease cleavage site just upstream from the ATG initiation codon, providing for a method for inserting any DNA fragment containing a protein translational start codon into the expression vectors behind the SD sequence.In other words, the gene in the expression piasmids described herein,could be any gene coding for a prokaryotic or eukariotic protein. For example, the herein described nucleotide sequences between the ribosome binding site and ATG initiation codon afford high expression of cDNA sequences, such as, prochymosin, prorennin , bovine growth hormone, porcine growth hormone, and human epdermal growth factor urogastrone . The proteins, bovine and porcine growth hormones and human epidermal growth factor, are collectively referred to herein as mammalian growth factors. Bacterial production of a particular heterologous gene can result in 2 polypeptide which may or may not have a methicnlBe residue at the amino terminus cf said polypeptide. Therefore, the term ,prochymosin1 prcrennin as used herein is intended to Include methionine prochymosin prorennin and prochymosin prorennin . The same applies to the other polypeptides described herein. Further, when reference to chymosin rennin is made herein it is intended to include within said term the known allelic forms thereof e.g. A, B, etc. . The following examples are intended to illustrate more fully the nature of the invention without acting as a limitation upon its cope.

The kinased linkers were stored at 20 C. When necessary the terminal 5 phosphates were removed from DNA by treatment either with bacterial alkaline phosphatase BAP or with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase CIP Chaconas et al.

The reaction mixture was incubated at 650C for 2 hours followed by phenol chloroform extractions, and ethanol precipitation of the DNA fragments. The construction of the bacterial expression plasmids involved manipulations that joined DNA fragments from various plasmids. All steps are shown in the accompanying Figures. Generally, DNA fragments were purified following isolation from gels and ligated to other fragments or plasmid DNA in 20 50 1 of 66 mM Tris HCL pH 7.6 , 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM ATP, 20 mM DTT and 1 pl T4 ligase 400 units .

Biochem. 102 423 428 1980 J . Miniprep amounts of DNA were prepared by a rapid modification of the alkaline SDS procedure Birnboim et al., Ibid. .Gel Electrophoresis Agarose slab gels, 0.7 to 18 were run according to the conditions described by Maniatis et al. loc.cit., p. 150 164 . Gels were stained for 15 minutes with 1 g ml ethidium bromide and photographed under illumination from 266 nm U.V. light using Polaroid film Type 57, ASS 3000 with a Kodak Wratten filter 23 A . Acrylamide gels 20 x 15 x 0.15 cm of 5 to 12.5 were used to identify small less than 1.5 kb restriction fragments according to the method described by Maniatis et al., Biochemistry 14 3787 3794 1975 .Gels were stained and photographed as for agarose gels. DNA fragments were purified from gel slices by electroelution in a dlalysis bag containing 0.1X TBE 8.9 mM Tris borate, 8.9 mM boric acid, 0.2 mM EDTA .Identification of Heterologous Protein Produced inE. coli Bacterial cultures containing pBR322 cr the expression plasmids pPFZ R2 or pPFZ R4 were grown overnight in LB broth or M9CA medium Maniatis et al., loc. cit. containing 4 g ml thiamine, 25 g ml ampicillin, and 100 g ml tryptophan. These cultures were diluted 1 25 into M9CA medium Maniatis et al. loc. cit., without tryptophan to allow complete induction of the tr promoter , or M9CA medium plus 100 g ml tryptophan to inhibit induction of the trt promoter , or LB medium for a negative control , and grown in shaker flasks to cell densities of A560 1.0.For total ell protein extraction, cell pellets equiva lent to 200 l culture were lysed in 28 sodium dodecyl sulfate SDS , 1 ss mercaptoethanol, and protein was precipitated with 10 volumes of cold acetone. Precipitated protein was redissolved in SDS sample buffer and aliquots were electrophoresed on 10 or 12.5 SDSpolyacrylamide gels Laemmli, Nature 227 680 685 1970 1. For labeled protein preparation, cell pellets from 1 ml aliquots of expression cultures were suspended in 1 ml supplemented M9CA medium M9CA salts, 0.28 glucose, 4 g ml thiamine, 26 g ml standard amino acids except methionine and tryptophan plus 25 yg ml ampicillin and 75 Ci 35S methionine NEN 970 Ci mmol .After one hour incubation at 37 C, cells were pelleted and resuspended in 200 l 10 mM Tris pH 8.0 1 mMNaEDTA, then placed on ice for 10 minutes following additions of lysozyme to 1 mg ml, NP4O to 0.2 percent, and NaCl to 0.35M final concentration. The lysate was adjusted to 10 mM MgCl2 and incubated on ice for 30 minutes with 50 g ml DNase I Sigma . Insoluble material was removed by mild centrifugation and this pellet fraction was dissolved in SDS sample bufferSupernatant samples were immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti prorennin antibody Beppu, Gene 19, 337 344 and staphylococcal adsorbent Pansorbin CalBiochem as described by Kessler J.Immunology 117 1482 1490 1976 . The samples were subjected to SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Laemmli, loc.cit. and enhanced Enlightning NEN before fluorography at 750C with Kodak XAR 2 film and a Cornex LightningPlus intensifying screen.Quantitation of Expression Leveis Estimations of the amount of heterologous protein. produced by expression cultures were determined by densitometer scanning cf protein gels containing total protein extracts from bacterial cultures. Individual lanes oj the SDS polyacrilamide gel of total cell protein extracts were analyzed using a Beckman DU 8B densitometer gel scan. The dried down Coomasie blue stained SDS polyacrylamide gel was scanned in each lane to determine the percent of the total cell protein in the heterogous protein band. A scan of the total cell protein from a control culture containing the pBR322 vector was used to determine the native protein content in the region of the gel corresponding to the size of the recombinant product.After correcting for the background peaks apparent in the control culture, the expression levels were estimated as a percent of the total cell protein. The protein gels were scanned at 579 nm.ResultsConstruction of ptrpLI R2 and ptrpLI R4 The plasmid ptrpLI is a pBR322 derivative that contains part of the E. coli trp promoter operator and the Shine Dalgarno SD sequence of trpL on a 360 bp HindIII ClaI fragment. Edman et al., Nature 291 503 506 1981 . This vector is, therefore, an expression plasmid with an unique ClaI cloning site adjacent t2 the trp regul,atory region. Inserted DNAs must contain with their sequence an ATG translational initiation ccdcn prior to the gene coding sequence which when inserted into ptrpLI will be properly spaced relative to the trpL ribosome binding site sequence.This expression vector was modified by inserting appropriate synthetic DNA linkers into theClaI site as illustrated in Figure 2. A specific double stranded synthetic DNA liner was used to alter the nucleotide content around the ClaI restriction site of ptrpLI. About 10 g of ptrpLI DNA was digested with 16 units of restriction endonuclease ClaI for 90 minutes at 370C. The cohesive erds generated cy t2 Clai cleavage were blunted in a 100 l reaction mixture containing 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.2 , 10 mM MgSO4, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2 mM dGTP, 0.2 mM dCTP. Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase 30 units was added and the reaction allowed to proceed at 200C for 45 minutes.After phenol and chloroform extraction, the indicated phosphorylated deoxyoligonucleotide linker 60 pmoles 5 AGAATTCATGG 3 was combined with 1 g 0.6 pmoles of the filled in vector fragment and ethanol precipitated. These fragments were ligated at 40C for 18 hours in 30 l of 66 mM Tris HCl ph 7.6 , 5 mM MgCl2, lmM ATP, 20 mM dithiothreitol and 800 units of T4 DNA ligase. The mixture was digested for 90 minutes with 3 units of EcoRI for 90 minutes. The EcoRI cleaved plasmid DNA was re ligated at 4 C for 4 hours in 100 l of 66 mM Tris ECl pH 7.6 , 5 mM MgCl2, lmM ATP, 20 mM DTT, and 400 units of T4 DNA ligase.Competent cells of E. coli strain HB101 were transformed with 25 l of the ligation mixture. Mandel et al., . Mol. Biol. 53 154 1970 . Plasmid DNA was prepared from 12 of the transformants and digested with EcoRI and HindIII. Ten pf these plasmids contained the desired 360 bp EcoRI HindIII fragment. Dna sequence analysis verified that one of these plasmids ptrpLI R4 had the desired orientation of the synthetic liner and desired sequence at the junctions between the trt tro moter and synthetic DNA. During the DNA sequenceing analysis of plasmid DNA from various transformants, it was discovered that one of the plasmids ptrpLl R2 had a 6 bp deletion in the region cf the ribosome binding site. This deletion most likely resulted from the 3 to 5 exonclease activity of the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I because the linker sequences are all present. It was recognized that this derivative had an altered ribosome binding site compared to the native trp SD sequence con tained in ptrpLI R4. Cloning of the Synthetic Prorennin Adapter The sequence of the synthetic double stranded DNA used to modify the amino terminal end of prorennin is shown EMI22.1 CATGGCTGAGATCACTAGGATCCTAGTGATCTCAGCCATGGTACCGACTCTAGTGATCCTAGGATCACTAGAGTCGGTACEMI22.2 This fragment was assembled from 2 sing stranded oligomers, 18 bp and 22 bp long. This synthetic DNA encodes the artifical ATG initiation codon for protein synthesis s and the first several codons of prorennin sequence as reported by Nishimori et al., J. Biochem.91 1085 1088 1982 in an inverted reDeat around aBamHI site. This synthetic DNA was subcloned into theEcoRI restriction site of pBR322 that had previously been treated with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymeraseI to fill in the cohesive ends. Subclones were identi fied by in situ colons hybridization of recombinant microorganisms using radioactively labeled 22 mer as probe Grunstein, M. and Hogness, D., Proc. Natal.Acad. Sci. 72 3961 1975 1. Plasmid DNA was prepared from 20 hybridization positive colonies and cleaved with BamHI or EcoRI to identify the subclDne containing the desired plasmid. Approximately 100 g plasmid DNA from recombinant microorganism 17 was cleaved withEcoRI and the 40 bp fragment was isolated on a 12.5 polyacrylamide gel. The purified 40 bp EcoRI fragment was inserted into the EcoRl sites of the 2 expression plasmid derivatives ptrpLI R2 and ptrpLI R4 which had been previously cleaved with EcoRI and dephosphorylated by treatment with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase. Plasmid DNA from several recombinant microorganisms of each ligation was prepared and digested with BamHI restriction endonuclease.Plasmids containing the 40 bp prorennin adapter inserted downstream from the trp expression sequence were identified by the presence of two BamHI sites approximately 700 bp apart. This construction scheme is illustrated inFigure 3. These expression plasmis were referred to as ptrpLI R2 B48 and ptrpLI R4 348. These recombinant microorganisms were used as the source for an approximately 370 bp HindIII BamHI DNA fragment containing the trt promoter operator sequence, the ribosome binding site, the artifical ATG initiation codon, and the chemically derived sequence coding for the first 5 amino acid residues of prorennin. The nucleotide sequences downstream from the promoter, in the region of the ribosome binding site, differ due to the previous insertion of a different chemically synthetisized deoxyoligonucleotide linker at the ClaI restriction site in the plasmid vector ptrpLI as described above.The resulting nucleotide content and spacing between the ribosome binding site rbs sequence and the ATG of the prorennin gene, and for other protein encoding genes disclosed herein, was shown byDNA sequence analysis to be as follows for each of the expression constructions pPFZ R EMI23.1 Spacing b R2 AAGGAGAAATTC ATG 5R4 AAGGGTATCGAGAATTC ATG Each ribosome binding site variation was used to make prorennin expression plasmids in order to later examine the possible effects that rbs nucleotide sequence content and,spacing have on protein expression levels.Construction of the Prorennin ExPression Plasmids The experimental steps used for constructing the prorennin expression plasmids are illustrated inFigure 1. First, the 4772 bp vector fragment containing the plasmid replicon, the ampicillin resistance marker, and the desired prorennin coding sequence from amino acid codon 83 to the stop TGA codon was prepared by digesting 30 g pCR101 plasnid DNA with HindIlI andKpnI restriction endonucleases. The restriction reaction was electrophoresed on a 1 agarose gel and both DNA fragments were isolated from gel slices by electroelution. The 906 bp HindIII KpnI fragment containing the amino terminal portion of the prorennin cDNA sequence was further digested by BamHI followed by electrophoresis on a 5 polyacrylamide gel.The 235 bp BamHI KpnI fragment encoding amino acid codons 6 to 83 was electroeluted from 2 gel slice. The HindIII BamHI DNA fragments containing the expression sequences from the different ptrpLI P B48 derivatives were separately mixed in approximately equal molar ratio with the two restriction fragments derived from pCR101 4772 bp and 235 bp . The mixtures were ligated by addition of T4 DNA ligase and a portionof each ligation mix used for introduction into competent HBlOl cells. Colonies were obtained in each instance when cells were selected on LB agar plates containing ampicillin 25 g ml . Several drug resistant colonies from the aforementioned colonies were picked into 5 nil LB cultures, and plasmid DNA was subjected to restriction enzyme analyses.In each group, most recombinant microorganisms were found to contain the complete prorennin gene recombined adjacent to the tr promoterrbs sequence. Restriction endonuclease analysis of these expression plasmids showed they contained the entire prorennin coding sequence properly aligned for direct expression of prorennin. DNA sequence analysis by the chemical degradation method of Maxam and Gilbert supra of most of the prorennin gene, the in vitro junction region and the trp promoter operator region confirmed that the artificial initiation codon and the prochymosin coding sequence directly follows the E.coli. trp promoter operator and served to establish the separate identity of the two expression plasmids at the nucleotide level. The two prorennin plasmids constructed here have been designated as pPFZ R2 and pPFZ R4. Further, the ATG initiation codon follows the E. ccli ribosomal binding site cf the t leader eptide by 5 and 11 nucleotides i expression plasmids pPFZ R2 and pPFZ R4, respectively. Translation of the DNA sequence of these expression plasmids predicts a prorennin protein of 366 amino acids. The estimated molecular weight cf such a polypeptide is about 41,000. When E. coli contain Ing an expression plasmid is grown in minimal media lacking tryptophan, the cells produce a protein that migrates slightly larger than mature chymosin about 36,000 daltons In sDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Laemmli, U. K. Nature 227 680 1970 . No such protein is produced by E. coli cells containing the vector plasmid pBR322 grown under identical conditions.Very little prorennin protein is produced by identical expression recombinants grown in M9CA media containing an abundance of tryptophan 100 sg ml , implying that production in E. coli of the putative prochymosin protein is under control of the trp promoter operator as designed.Evaluation of Prorennin Synthesis bv Expression Cultures E. coli transformants carrying the prorennin expression plasmids pPFZ R2 and pPFZ R4 were grown inM9CA media lacking tryptophan for induction of the trt promoter. Cells were grown in shaker flasks to anOD550 of 1.0. Cell pellets from these cultures were lysed in 2 percent SDS, 1 percent beta mercaptoethanol, and proteins were precipitated with acetone. Precipitated proteins were redissolved in SDS sample buffer and aliquots were electrophoresed on 10 percent SDSpolyacrylamide gels Laemmli, Nature 227 680 1970 . Prorennin levels were determined by densitometer gel scans of the Coomassie blue stained gel at 579 nm. It has been observed by phase contrast microscopy thas refractile inclusion bodies exist in E. . coli cells containing the prochymosin expression plasmids.Control cells containing the plasmid vector pBR322 when grown under identical conditions reveal no such refractile inclusion bodies. Analogous observations have been reported with respect to genetically engineered microorganisms which produce exogenous gene products Carrier et al., Trends in BioTechnology 1 109 1983 , such as insulin and thymosin. The refractile bodies are considered to be pools of the expressed foreign protein. The presence of refractile inclusion bodies appears to directly correlate with a high level of prorennin production. The above described bacterially synthesized pro chymosin specifically reacts with prorennin antibodies. Evaluation of the growth of recombinants of E.coli HB101 carrying plasmids pPFZ R2 and pPFZ R4 under identical shaker flask growth conditions showed that plasmid pPFZ R2 reproducibly produced prorennin levels ranging from 10 to 15 , and pPFZ R4 produced prorennin levels ranging from 5 to 7 . Expression Percent of Total CultureStrain Plasmid Cell Protein O.D. 550HB101 pPFZ R2 13.1 0.5 pPFZ R4 7.1 0.5HB101 pPFZ R2 11.6 0.1 10.2 0.6HB101 pPFZ R2 15.4 0.3 11.7 0.5 pPFZ R4 7.0 1.0 Based on densitometer scans of SDS polyacrylamide gels. The only difference between the two prorennin expression constructions pPFZ R2, and pPFZ R in terms of nucleotide composition occurs ifl te sequences around the rlbosome binding site and initiator codcn of the prorennin gene. Yet there is significant variation in the levels of prorennin expression between cultures containing the different plasmids. The observed differences in prorennin expression can be attributed to the differences in the primary DNA sequence around the ribosome binding site.As first noted by Shine and Dalgarno 1974, PNAS 71 1342 1342 , there is a purine rich sequence centered about 10 nucleotides upstream from the initiator codon that is complementary to the 3 terminal sequence of 16S ribosomal RNA. An overwhelming body of evidence now supports the role of mRNA to rRNA base pairing in the selection of protein synthesis initiation sites by coli ribosomes.Ribosome binding sites from many bacterial and phage mRNAs have been sequenced and a consensus Shine Dalgarno sequence has been determined to be TAAGGAGST. Three parameters influence the efficiency of the Shine Dalgarno interaction 1 the length of complementarity 2 the distance between theShine Dalgarno sequence and the initiator codon and 3 the extent to which the Shine Dalgarno sequence is masked by secondary structure. Examination b the area around the S.D. sequence of each of the above two expression plasmids spacing DNA Consensus Sequence bp S.D. TAAGGAGGT trcL AAGTTCACGTAAAAAGGGTATCGACA ATG 7 pPFZ R2 AAGTTCACGTAAAAAGGAGAATTC ATG 5 pPFZ R4 AAGTTCACGTAAAAGGGTATCGAGAATTC ATG 11 shows that the length of the complementarity in pPFZ R2 is 6 contiguous nucleotides, whereas the other has only 3 contiguous nucleotides. Also, the spacing between the ribosome binding site and the initiator codon is 5 nucleotides in pPFZ R2,, which is very close to the spacing in the natural trpL gene initiator region where 7 nucleotides intervene whereas, pPFZ R4 has 11 nucleo tides between the ribosome binding site and initiator, codon.Another important feature of efficient ribosome binding sites recognized in pPFZ R2 is a translational stop codon TAA in the same reading frame as the prorennin coding sequence just prior to the ShineDalgarno sequence. All these features of the pPFZ R2DNA sequence play a role in its highly efficient prorennin es ressicn. The degeneracy of the genetic code, of course, affords a certain degree of variation in composition of a given nucleotide sequence without altering the amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by said sequence. Thus, two or more different base sequences synonymous codons can be substituted in a given nucleotide sequence without changing the identity ofA the amino acids specified thereby. Further, it is possible to delete codons or to substitute one or more codons by codons other than degenerate codons to,, produce a structurally modified polypeptide but one which has substantially the same utility or activity of the polypeptide produced by the unmodified DNA molecule.Said two polypeptides are functionally equivalent, as are the two DNA molecules which give rise to their production, even though the differences between said DNA molecules are not related to degeneracy of the genetic code. The codon for the A, amino acid, threonine, isACT instead cf ACC. Due to the redundancy o the genet ic code this does rot chanae the amino acid at this position. Since this scheme employs the construction of 2 hybrid gene in which the section coding for the N terminal portion of the hormone is made synthetically, the synthetic DNA allows for the design of a new coding sequence for that portion of prorennin. Because the amino acid sequence of prorennin is exactly maintained due to the redundancy of the genetic code, these kinds of sequence changes are insignificant and the gene produces an equivalent polypeptide to that produced in nature with the exception of the N terminal met . The isolation of methionine prorennin expressed by bacterial E. coli transformants of this invention, its conversion to rennin and the milk clotting activity of said rennin was demonstrated by the methodology described in British Patent Application 2,100,737A and by Emtage et al., Proc. Natl. Acad.Sci. 80 3671 3675 1983 . Plasmids carrying, an E. coli .trp promoter operator fragment, an ATG initiation codon, either the ribosome binding site comprising R2 or R4, and cDNA gene sequences encoding bovine growth hormone, porcine growth hormone or human epidermal growth factor have also been constructed, and when introduced into E.coli, resulted in highly efficient expression of the heterologous proteins. The nucleotide sequence of the vector, promoter, and ribosome binding site up to theATG initiation codon were essentially the same as described above for the prorennin expression plasmids.The expression levels of the heterologous protein produced by these various constructs were determined by .SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by scanning densitometry. The relative levels of expression obtained with these cultures were similar to those observed with prorennin expression. That is, animal growth hormone expression plasmids containing the R2 version of the ribosome ,binding site exceeded the expression levels of the R4 version by approximately 4 to 5 fold the ultimate expression level in E. coli cells was around 25 to 30 of the total cellular protein. The scheme used to achieve expression of the bGH and pGH genes was essentially the same as the method published by P. Seeburg et al. 1983, DNA 2137 45 for the expression of animal growth hormones. It confirmed construction of a composite gene consisting of a cloned synthetic DNA and cloned cDNA sequences. This construction design allowed for the direct expression in E. coli of bGH and pGH without the signal sequence by introducing a translation initiation codon for the first amino acid of the mature hormone. The use of synthetic DNA also allowed for the design of a new coding sequence for the amino terminal region of the bGH and pGH genes. The amino acid sequences encoded by the synthetic regions of the growth hormone genes were exactly maintained due to the redundancy of the genetic code. The plasmid containing the bGH cDNA was obtained as described by Miller et al., J. Biochem. 255, 7521 1980 and was designated pBGH 102. It is esulvalent to plasmid BP348 of Miller et al. The nucleotide sequence of bGH mRNA and its corresponding amino acid sequence as predicted by the nucleotide sequence wer previously published Miller, W., et al., loc. cit. .The restriction fragment containing the tryptophan promoter operator and ribosome binding site sequences were obtained from ptrpLl R2 and Rt. The sequences of the synthetic double stranded DNA used to modify the amino and carboxy termini of the growth hormone genes were extracted from the paper by Seeburg et al. 1983, DNA 2 37 45 . The oligonucleotides were synthesized, as noted above, using the phosphoramidite chemistry Caruthers, et al. and fragments were assembled from single stranded oligomers, 11 16 bases long. The N terminal synthetic DNA encodes the artificial ATG initiation codon for protein synthesis and, the first 23, amino acid codons of bGH. To facilitate its insertion into pBR322 DNA, this synthetic fragment also included 4 base single strand cohesive ends on the 5 ends corresponding in sequence to the cohesive ends generated by restriction endonucleases EcoRI andHindIII. The desired ligation product was isolated from a 5 polyacrylamide gel as a band of approximately 80 bp.The purified DNA was then ligated with pBR322DNA which had been previously digested with restriction endonucleases EcoRI and HindIII, and transformed into competent E. coli cells. The cloned synthetic DNA was subject to DNA sequence analysis using the chemical degradation method Maxam and Gilbert, 1980, MethodsEnzymol 65 499 to ensure the integrity of the modified bGH sequence. Expression vectors similar to the plasmids described by Seeburg et al. were constructed for both bGH and HGH in orcer C compare the effect of the altered ribosome binding sit on the expression of mammalian genes other than prorennin.The experimental steps used for constructing the bGH expression plasmids are illustratec in Figures 5 and 6. First the region om the cDNA clone, pBGH 102, encoding sequences for amino acids 23 to 86, was isolated on a 5 polyacrylamide gel and ligated to the cloned synthetic 75 bp EcoRI PvuII fragment isolated from the pBR322 subclone which encodes sequences for the ATG initiation codn and the first 22 amino acids of bGH. The ligation was was cleaved with restriction endonucleases EcoRI and PstI, and a 270 bp fragment was isolated from a 53 polyacrylamide gel and inserted into appropriately cleaved pBR322 DNA. Using these two sites, the EcoRI PstI DNA fragment of modified bGH gene sequence can be inserted into the pBR322 plasmid so that only one orientation of insertion, is possible.Plasmid DNA isolated from transformants obtained in the ligation were cleaved with EcoRI and PstI to verify the insertion of the 270 bp bGH gene fragment into the vector. Next, the 440 bp PstI DNA fragment from p3GH 102 containing the coding sequences of bGH amino acids 91 to 191 plus the 3 untranslated region of the bGH cDNA was inserted into the PstI site of this plasmid DNA in order to complete the reconstruction cf the full length bGH gene. This PstI fragment could be inserted in two possible orientations relative to the rest of the bGH gene.According to the restriction rnap, the desired orientation cf the insert would generate an approximately 490 bp PvuII fragment completely internal to the bGH gene while the wrong orientation would result in a 350 bp PvuII DNA fragment.Multiple isolates of both orientations were identified after cleavage of plasmid DNA from tetracvclineresistant transformants with restriction endonuclease PvulI. One of the plasmids identified in this manner was designated pBGH 212, and this full length bGH gene was further analyzed by restriction mapping and DNA sequencing to ensure the correctness of the plasmid construction. The next step in the assembly of the bGH expression plasmids involved the insertion of EcoRI DNA fragments containing the E. coli trt promoter and ribosome binding sequences. The full length box clone, pBGH212, was cleaved with restriction endonuclease corp, treated with bacterial alkaline phosphatase, and ligated with two different approximately 390 bp EcoRI fragments containing the sequences required for bacterial expression of bGH. Two different ligations were done to insert the trp promoter rbs fragments, each with slightly different nucleotide sequences in the gene initiation region, into pBGH 212. Competent cells of strain HB101 were transformed with each ligation reaction mix.Several tetracycline resistant colonies from each transformation were picked and isolated plasmid DNA was subject to restriction endonuclease digestion analysis. The trn promoter rbs containing fragment could insert into the pBGH 212 DNA in two possible orientations relative to the direction of transcription from the promoter. The orientation of the promoter rbs insert which would result in transcription of the bGH gene generates a 60 bp HindIII DNA fragment, while the undesired orientation generates a 400 bp fragment. Multiple recombinant microorganisms from each ligation mix were identified with plasmids bearing the complete bGH gene adjacent to the tr promoter rbs sequence in the configuration required for direct expression. The construction of expression plasmids was initiated by isolating an approximately 920 bp HindlIIPvuII partial DNA fragment from the plasmids pBGH212 R2 and pBGH 212 R4. This DNA fragment contains the tro promoter rbs sequence and almost the entire bGH coding sequence tall bt the last 4 amino acid residues and the stop codon . To express the entire hormone, a fragment of synthetic DNA encoding the Cterminal end of bGH was cloned into pBR 322. This 20 bp DNA fragment was synthesized as two separate oligomers, annealed t6 form a double stranded fragment, and Inserted into pBR322 DNA digested wit restriction endonucleases EcoRI and HindIII.After digestion of plasmid DNA from this subclone with restriction endonucleases PvuII and BamHI, a, 365 bp PvuII BamHIDNA fragment was gel isolated and purified by electroelution. The final expression plasmids were assembled by ligating the cloned synthetic terminal containing fragment 365 bp with each of the trp promoter rbsbGH DNA fragment 920 bp and the pBR322 deriyed vector fragment 3995 bp , as shown in Figure 6. The full length bGH expression plasmids were identified by restriction endonuclease cleavage with PvuII.. These bGH expression plasmids were further characterized by more precise determination of the restriction enzyme cleavage map.Additional characterization o these expression plasmids by DNA seasuencing verified the modified bG 3 gene sequence and established the separate identity of the two different vectors designated pBGH 301 and pBGH 375. Translation of the DNA sequences of these expression plasmias predicts a hormone polypeptide of 191 amino acid residues. The estimated molecular weight of such 2 protein would be about 22,000. Thien,cells containing the bGn expression plasmids pBGH 301 and pB 375 were grown under conditions known to induce trP promoter directed expression, the cells produced a comigrating protein the size of purified bGH protein obtained from Miles when total protein extracts were examined on SDS polyacrylamide gel Laemmli, U. 1970,Nature 277, 680 .This band was not visible in protein extracts from cells containing the vector plasmid pBR322 grown under identical conditions. The bGE levels were estimated by densitometer gel scanning at 579 nm. The cultures containing the expression plasmid with the R2 version of the rbs pBGH 301 produced bGH at levels of about 20 to 25 of the total cellular protein. Whereas, the cells containing the pBGH 375 expression plasmid with the R4 version of the rbs produced bGH at levels about 5 to 7 of the total cellular protein. In the case of pGH expression, a scheme analogous to that used for bGH expression was employed. The sequence of the double stranded DNA used to modify the amino terminal end of the pGH gene was essentially as described by Seeburg et.al., loc. cit. . The experimental steps used for constructing the pGH expression plasmids are illustrated in Figure 7. First, the region from the cDNA clone pGH 24 was substituted with the synthetic region of the pGH gene. Because the region coding for amino acid resides 22 and 23 of pGH lacked a PvuII site, the synthetic 5 part of the pGH hybrid gene was joined to the coding sequences derived from the cloned cDNA at an Asul site which occurs at amino acid codons 16 and 17 in pGH 24.AnAsuI site was also incorporated at the same position in the synthetic DNA coding for the amino terminal end of pGH. Due to the presence of additional Asul sites in the cloned cDNA, the pGE gene was reconstructed from three different DNA fragments. The 635 bp PstI PvuII fragment isolated from pGH24 was digested with RsaI and the resulting 200 bpPstI RsaI fragment was further cleaved with AsuI. The modified gene was constructed by ligating together the cloned synthetic EcoRI AsuI 53 bp fragment, the 75 bp AsuI RsaI fragment, and the 480 bp RsaI PvuII frag ment. The product of this ligation was digested wit EcoRI and PvuII, and a D fragment corresponding to 570 bp in size was isolated from a 5 polyacrylamide gel.This fragment was ligated wit the EcoRI PvuII partial vector fragment from the bGH expression plasmid pBGH 375 and transformed into competent cells of E. coli strain MM294 ATCC 33625 and selected on plates containing ampicillin, This pre expression plasmid identified by the presence of a 910 bp EcoRI BamHI fragment contains the full length pGH gene, since the pGH and bGH proteins have the same Cterminal amino acid sequence, The next step in the construction of the pGH expression plasmids involved the insertion of the approximately 390 bp EcoRI DNA fragments containing the E. coli trp operon promoter sequence and modified ribosome binding sites.The full length pGH plasmid was cleaved with restriction endonuclease EcoRI any ligated with separate versions, of the EcoRI fragments containing the sequence needed for bacterial expression cf pGH. Two different ligation reactions were made using expression fragments with slightly nucleotide sequences in the region around the ribosome binding site. Competent cells of strain C600 were transformed with each ligation reaction. Plasmid DNA was isolated from several drug resistant colonizes from each transformation and was subjected to restriction endonuclease digestion analyses.The trp promoter containing fragment could insert into the pre expression plasmld in two possible orientations relative to te direction of transcriptIon from the trp promoter. The orientation of the promoter insert fragment which would result in the transcription of the pGH gene generates a 920 bp HindIII DNA fragment while the undesired orientation generates a 600 bp DNA. fragment. Multiple isolates from each I ion reaction were identified with plasmids bearing the complete pGH eene adjacent to the trp promoter and rbs sequence in the configuration required for direct expression.. Further characterization of these expression constructions was achieved by physical mapping with additional restriction endonucleases. Additional characterization of these pGH expression plasmids by DNA sequencing has established their separate identity at the nucleotide level. The two pGE expression plasmids were designated pGH 101 and pGH 107. Translation of the DNA sequence of these pGH express ion plasmids predicts a hormone polypeptide of 191 amino acids. The estimated molecular weight of such a protein would be about 22,000. When recombinant microorganisms comprising plasmids pGH 101 or pGH 107 were grown under conditions known to induce trp promoter directed expression, the cells produced a protein with a size of about 22,000 daltons. This band was absent from protein extracts prepared from cells containing the vector plasmid pBR322 grown under identical conditions. The level of pGH production was determined using densitometer scans of individual lanes of SDS polyacrylamide gels.Several E. coli proteins fall into the 22,000 dalton size range and constitute about 2 to 59 of the total cell protein in control cell extracts. Correcting for the contribution of these native proteins, the pGH bands visible in the expression culture protein extract represent about 5 and 15 of the total cell protein for pGH 101 and pGH107, respectively. The quantitation of pGH levels in cultures grown in the presence of tryptophan 100 sg ml showed reduced levels of pGH expression. This fact would imply that production in E. coli of the pGH protein was indeed under control of the trt promoter operator as designed.The difference in expression levels in the case of pGH was similar to that observed in prorennin and bGH expression using the same ribosome binding site sequence. Another example of efficient expression 0 a heterologous gene using the R2 trp promoter rbs is the production of human urogastrone or epidermal growth factor hEGF from a synthetic DNA sequence The plan devised to achieve efficient bacterial production of hEGF employed the chemicai construction of a DNA fragment containing the coding sequence of mature hEGF. This approach allowed for the direct expression of the mature hormone by introducing an ATG initiation codon for, protein synthesis in front of the codon coding for the first amino acid residue of the mature EGF polypeptide. The synthetic gene is composed of 15 oligonucleotides, 12 to 45 bases in length.Three separate ligations were performed and the intermediate ligation products were isolated on a polyacrylamide gel. The purified intermediate ligation products were then ligated in the final assembly of the hEGF gene. To facilitate its insertion into plasmid pBR322 DNA, the synthetic h GF gene was designed to contain EcoRI and HindIII restriction endonuclease cohesive ends at its termini. The hEGF synthetic DNA was ligated with pBR322 DNA cleaved withEcoRI and HindIII and the synthetically derived region of the plasmid was analyzed by DNA sequencing Maxam and Gilbert, loc. cit. to ensure correctness. Vectors for the expression of hEGF in E. coli were constructed using the trD promotr rbs fragment previously used for high level expression cf prorennin, bGH, and pGH. The construction of the EGF expression plasmis was initiated by cleavage of the pBR322 EGF subclone with the restriction endcnuclease DOOR and subsequend dephosphorylation with bacterial alkaline phosphatase. The expression plasmids were constructed using the EcoRI fragments containing the tro promoterrbs sequence. Two different ligations were done employing the trp promo ter rbs fragments with slightly different nucleotide sequences in the region around the ribosome binding site.Competent cells of E. coli strain HB101 were transformed with each ligation reaction Several drug resistant colonies from each transformation were picked and isolated plasmid DNA was subject to restriction endonuclease cleavage analysis. The trp promoter rbs containing fragment could be inserted into the EGF subclone in two possible orientations relative to the direction of transcription from the promoter.The orientation of the promoter insert fragment which would result in expression of the synthetic EGF gene generates a 510 bp HindIII DNA fragment, whereas the undesired orientation generates a 200 bp HindIII DNA fragment. Multiple isolates from each ligation reaction were Identified with plasmids bearing the EGF gene adjacent to the bacterial promoterrbs ,sequence in te configuration required or direct expression. DNA sequence analysis of the expression plasmids confirmed that the EGF coding sequence directly follows the E. coli trp promoter rbs as desired. The ATG initiation codon follows the ribosome binding site sequence by 5 and 11 nucleotides in theEGF expression plasmids designated pEGF R2 and pEGFR4, respectively. Translation of the DNA sequence of the EGF expression plasmids predicts a 54 amino acid poly peptide containing sis cysteine residues, which are throught to form three intrachain disulphide bonds.The estimated molecular weight of such a hormone would be about 6,353. Cultures of a mutant strain of E. coli designated as lon Gottesman et al., J. Bacteriol.148, 265, 1981 , available, from their. coil GeneticStock Center, vale University, New Haven, Connecticut, as strain No. ECGSC 6436, were transformed with EGF expression plasmids and grown under conditions known to induce trp promoter directed expression. This mutant strain, which lacks one of several proteases present in wild type cells, was used to minimize proteolysis of the bacterially produced hEGF. Total protein extracts of these expression cultures were examined on 15 SDS polyacrylamide gels in an effort to determine the level of EGF production. Although there was relatively poor resolution of the low molecular weight polypeptides including purified mouse EGF obtained from a commercial source , there, appeared to be more protein in the EGF molecular weight range in the extracts from expression cultures compared to control extrats. Densitometer scans of individual lanes of the SDS polyacrylamide gel were run. Cellular proteins less than 10,000 daltons in size constitute about one percent the total cellular protein in control extracts. Correcting for the contribution of these native proteins, the putativeEGF levels in the expression, culture protein extracts corresponds to about 3 to 5 percent cf the total cellular protein.
