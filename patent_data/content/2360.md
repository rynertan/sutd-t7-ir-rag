# Method for automatically limiting one controlled variable of a multivariable system and apparatus for antisurge protection of a dynamic compressor.

## Abstract
A control apparatus for antisurge protection of a dynamic compressor including a junction of a closed antisurge loop with a surge limit computing module and a two mode controller with a relay backup system with deviation alarms is characterized in operation in that during a slow disturbance, the two mode controller provides modulated antisurge protection by opening a relief valve. If the operating point of the compressor crosses the surge control line and during a dangerously fast disturbance, the relay backup system 119 provides antisurge protection if a preestablished deviation of the operating point from the surge control line appears. The relay backup system 119 opens the relief valve 107 very quickly. When the relief valve 107 is so opened, the process of the user 106 of fluid from the compressor 101 is compensated by increasing the performance of the compressor 101 to maintain pressure or flow rate. Then the relay system 119 closes the relief valve 107 exponentially, which prevents a dangerous deviation of the operating point from the surge control line. In time, the surge limit line may change so that the surge control line is no longer correctly placed. If under such circumstances surge appears, then the backup relay system 119 opens the relief velve 107 very fast, closes it exponentially and changes the position of surge control line.
