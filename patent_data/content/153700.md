## Description
The present invention provides a method for curing organopolysiloxane compositions. More specifically, the present invention provides a method for curing organopolysiloxane compositions which consist of a photosensitizer and an addition curable organopolysiloxane containing a platinum type catalyst by heating and by exposure to ultraviolet radiation or to an electron beam. It is known in the prior art that organopolysiloxane compositions can generally be cured by heating refer to Japanese Patents 35 13709 60 13709 , 36 1397 61 1397 and 46 76798 71 76798 . However, all of these methods require elevated temperatures and heating for long periods of time with the resulting drawback of low productivity. On the other hand, organopolysiloxane compositions which can be cured at room temperature or low temperatures by exposure to ultraviolet radiation or an electron beam refer to Japanese Kokai Laid Open Patents 50 61386 75 61386 United Kingdom patent Specification No. 1,433,461, published April 28, 1976 , 50 61486 75 61486 U.S. Patent No. 4,064,027, issued December 20, 1977 , and 55 125123 80 125123 have been developed due to recent demands for increased productivity and the increasing diversity of applications. However, these compositions have certain drawbacks including one or more of the following a strong mercaptan odor, quite poor pot stability at room temperature, slow curing rates inappropriate for practical applications, and nonuniform curing in interior sections. Various methods were examined by the present inventors in order to eliminate the preceding drawbacks with the resulting development of a method for curing organopolysiloxane compositions, including uniform curing in interior sections, by heating and by exposure to ultraviolet radiation or an electron beam for a short period of time at low temperatures. This invention relates to a method for curing organopolysiloxane compositions characterized by concurrently heating and exposing to ultraviolet radiation or an electron beam a photosensitizer containing organopolysiloxane composition which consists of If any of the above mentioned components A , 1 to 4 and B is omitted or changed, no sufficient curing within short time can be obtained. From the above follows that the selection of the components A , 1 to 4 and B of the composition is critical for obtaining very short cure times. DE A 27 36 499 discloses a process for producing adhesive compositions consisting essentially of However, there is no disclosure for the special combination of the components A , 1 to 4 and B of the composition according to the invention. All the examples of the cited reference use either a reaction product of H₂PtCl₆.6H₂O and cyclohexanol or a platinum vinylsiloxane complex. As these platinum complexes involve already a photosensitizer, it is not necessary according to the cited reference to use a separate photosensitizer, which is, however, obligatory in the composition according to the invention. So all the examples of the cited reference do not include a separate photosensitizer as claimed. As shown in tables 1 to 4 of the cited reference, the curing time can be as low as 15 seconds at 45 C, but normally the curing time is up to 60 seconds. As shown by a test with an adhesive tape, there remains a residual adhesive power which shows that at least at 45 C no complete adhesion occurs. Only at 90 C the compositions can be cured sufficiently, so that the desired anti adhesive properties are obtained. In comparison to the cited reference, the examples according to the invention show a dramatic difference in cure time, namely a much shorter time of exposure to ultraviolet radiation, and a much shorter heating time in order to obtain a completely cured product. In the cited reference, there is no hint how to select the components A , 1 to 4 and B in order to shorten the curing rates appropriate for practical applications. FR A 1 267 705 discloses a process for vulcanisation of organopolysiloxanes having the polymer unit wherein R is a monovalent hydrocarbon radical or a halogenated monovalent hydrocarbon radical, by concurrent exposure to heat and ionic radiation. In this prior art, however, there is no disclosure for a composition having the components A , 1 to 4 of the composition according to the invention. Further, the shown composition is not cross linked in presence of a photosensitizer. Therefore, also a combination of the cited references does not give any suggestion with respect to the composition according to the invention and the method for curing the same. The addition curable organopolysiloxane compositon A may contain organic solvents, extender fillers, thermal stabilizers, flame retardants, etc., as optional components. The addition reaction retarder component A , 4 is an essential component which has the effect of inhibiting the reaction at room temperature in order to impart pot stability to the composition. Examples of alkynyl alcohols which can be used as retarders 4 are 3 methyl 1 butyne 3 ol, 3,5 dimethyl 1 hexyne 3 ol, 3 methyl 1 pentyne 3 ol, and phenylbutynol. The retarder compounds can be used as reaction inhibitors singly or as mixtures of two or more compounds. The quantity of addition reaction retarder is determined by the condition that a practical pot life be imparted to the present composition. Although the reaction inhibiting effect will depend on molecular structure, this quantity is 0.1 to 1.0 part by weight per 100 parts by weight polydiorganosiloxane 1 and may be adjusted up or down depending on the purpose. The photosensitizer comprising component B accelerates the curing reaction of the present composition upon exposure to ultraviolet radiation or an electron beam. In the method of the present invention, the photosensitizer containing organopolysiloxane composition consisting of the preceding components A and B is converted into a rubbery elastomer or cured resin by heating and by exposure to ultraviolet radiation or an electron beam. The heating conditions depend on the type of preceding organopolysiloxane, the quantity of addition of platinum type catalyst and the thickness of the coated film however, the heating conditions are determined by the requirement that the present composition be semi cured by the heat treatment alone. The ultraviolet generating source is any such source known in the prior art and examples thereof are hydrogen discharge tubes, xenon discharge tubes, and low pressure, medium pressure, and high pressure mercury lamps. The electron beam source is any such source known in the prior art and examples thereof are scanning electron beam generators and curtain electron beam generators. The conditions of exposure to the ultraviolet radiation or electron beam are arbitrary as long as exposure alone can semi cure the present composition. With regard to the order of treatment, ultraviolet or electron beam exposure can be executed after the heat treatment, the heat treatment can be executed after ultraviolet or electron beam exposure, or the heat treatment and ultraviolet or electron beam exposure can be executed simultaneously. However, when the composition of the present invention is dissolved or dispersed in organic solvent, it is preferably exposed to ultraviolet radiation or an electron beam after the heat treatment. According to the method of the present invention, the composition is completely cured by a combination of heating at low temperatures for a brief period with ultraviolet or electron beam exposure for a brief period. The composition is cured at temperatures much lower than in a prior art heat treatment alone and is cured in times much shorter than in prior art ultraviolet or electron beam exposure alone. Process productivity is thus increased and the mild heating conditions are appropriate for applications such as in the electronic materials industry, in coating synthetic resins and in the use of release agents. The present invention will be explained using demonstrational examples.
