# High speed imaging method with three dimensional NMR.

## Abstract
The present invention is an imaging method with three dimensional NMR to which an echo planar method is applied. After excitation of nuclear spin, the gradient magne tic field Gx for phase encoding is applied and there is repeated a sequence of measuring and obtaining an echo train of spin echoes with a constant gradient magnetic field Gx and a periodically inverted gradient magnetic field Gy, as varying the amount of encoding, so as to obtain the three dimensional imaging by the Fourier conversion. Moreover, after the selective excitation of spins within an X Y surface, a 180 radio frequency pulse is applied. As varying the time difference τ₁ between the interval from the excitation till the application of the 180 radio frequency pulse and the interval from the application thereof till a peak of a first echo of a echo train, three dimensional imaging is carried out with a chemical shift axis as one axis by repeating the sequence and accomplishing Fourier conversion with τ₁ as a numerical variable.
