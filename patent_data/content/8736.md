# Torque converter with internally reversible turbine shaft.

## Abstract
Gearing is normally used to obtain reverse operation from an output turbine. An improvement is provided herein in a torque converter 10 which comprise a stator 12 , an impel ler 14 and an output turbine 16 . The improvement com prises a plurality of self cambering blades 42 carried by the output turbine 16 with the angle at which fluid impelled by the impeller 14 attacks the self cambering blades 42 being adjusted to select the direction of rotation of the output tur bine 16 . In this manner, the output shaft 36 , which is driven by the output turbine 16 , can be rotated in either a clockwise or a counterclockwise direction thereby driving a vehicle or other machinery in either a forward or reverse direction with out the necessity for gearing.
