## Description
This invention relates to protease enzyme inhibitors useful for a variety of physiological end use applications. In its broad aspects, this invention relates to analogs of peptidase substrates in which the amide group containing the scissile amide bond of the substrate peptide has been replaced by an activated electrophilic ketone moiety such as fluoromethylene ketone or α keto carboxyl derivatives. These analogs of the peptidase substrates provide specific enzyme inhibitors for a variety of proteases, the inhibition of which will have useful physiological consequences in a variety of disease states. In its more specific aspects, this invention relates to activated electrophilic ketone derivatives of certain peptidase substrates which are useful in inhibiting serine , thiol , carboxylic acid and metallo dependent protease enzymes, the inhibition of which will have useful physiological consequences in a variety of disease states. Still more specifically, this invention relates to activated electrophilic ketone derivatives of peptidase substrates which fall within the following generic groupings characterized according to their active site dependencies. Such generic groupings are The contemplated peptidase inhibitors of the foregoing enzymes are selected from the generic formula including the hydrates thereof, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof wherein X embraces subgroups X₁ and X₂, wherein X₁ is CF₂H, CF₃, CO₂R₃ or CONHR₃, and Unless otherwise stated the α amino acid building blocks of these peptidase substrates are preferably in their L configuration. Before further defining and or illustrating the scope of the peptidase substrate inhibitors embraced by formula I, it may be convenient to state some of the more basic concepts related to peptides. For example, except for proline, all of the α amino acids found in proteins have, as a common denominator, a free carboxyl group and a free unsubstituted amino group on the α carbon atom in proline, since proline s α amino group is substituted it is really an α imino acid, but for convenience, it will also be spoken of as an α amino group . Additionally each α amino acid has a characteristic R group , the R group being the side chain, or residue, attached to the α carbon atom of the α amino acid. For example, the R group side chain for glycine is hydrogen, for alanine it is methyl, for valine it would be isopropyl. Thus, throughout this specification the R₂ or R₄ moiety is the side chain R group for each indicated α amino acid . For the specific R groups or side chains of the α amino acids reference to A. L. Lehninger s text on Biochemistry see particularly Chapter 4 would be helpful. As a further convenience for defining the scope of the compounds embraced by the generic concept of Formula I, as well as the sub generic concepts relating to each of the individual enzymes involved in this invention, various α amino acids have been classified into a variety of groups which impart similar functional characteristics for each of the specific enzymes to be inhibited by the peptidase substrates of Formula I. These groups are set forth in Table II and the recognized abbreviations for the α amino acid blocks are set forth in Table I. In light of the foregoing, the defined compounds of formula I may also be stated as being An activated electrophilic ketone bearing peptidase inhibitor of the formula the hydrates thereof, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof wherein with the proviso that when R₂ is the side chain of an amino acid of group E and when, in case R₁ is an amino acid or a peptide, the amino acid next to the amino group is a member of group D, then X is other than a CF₃ group. To illustrate those compounds which are useful as enzyme inhibitors for human leukocyte elastase, and to serve as a medium of instruction for a better understanding of the scope of compounds embraced within the generic formula I, and its sub generic formulae for each of the involved enzymes herein disclosed the following formula Ia represents the sub generic class defining those compounds within the scope of inhibitors of human leukocyte elastase wherein R₂ is the side chain of the depicted enzyme directing α amino acid building block P₁ , Still for instructional purposes, the structural formula for the most preferred human leukocyte elastase inhibitor is the vertical dotted lines setting off each moiety constituting the specific arrangement for that particular peptidase inhibitor. Except for proline and 2 indoline carboxylic acid the moieties encircled within the dotted lines represent the R group side chains of the α amino acid building block see pages 69 71 of the above cited Lehninger s text or 1 naphthylmethyl. Still another way of representing the foregoing substrate is by the formula with R, R₂, R₄ being the side chain residues of the particular α amino acid, the amino acid building block of P 2 P₂ primed being the R₅, if any, of X₂ and the terminal P 3 being a specific of the Y radical of X₂, P₅ being the terminal moiety sometimes referred generically as P Still another, and the most convenient method for simply conveying the structure involved is the formula wherein X consists of P 1, P 2Y when representative of wherein for the illustrations above, P 1 bears the CH₃ side chain R group for R₄ and P 2 bears the R₅ amino acid block bearing the CH₃ side chain and Y is NH₂, and P₁ P₅ are shorthand designations for the depicted P₁ P₅ moieties of the above structures II and III. To expand on structure IV and Ia as it encompasses the scope of the other X moieties attached to the same P₁ P₅ moieties, the following seven structures are shown moiety of X₂ as CF₂ α amino acid wherein the name of the α amino acid to which R₄ is a side chain is indicated such as, for example, in this convention becomes CF₂ Ala . This will facilitate the writing and comprehension of the so defined structures.

The preparation of the compounds of formula I may be achieved using standard chemical reactions analogously known to be useful for the preparation of a variety of known peptides. Indeed, for the most part, once certain key intermediate α amino acid derivatives are prepared, the procedures for obtaining the final products may readily be effected using standard techniques known to those skilled in the field of peptide chemistry. For this purpose, a handy reference text for these techniques is the 1985 The Practice of Peptide Synthesis by M. Bodanszky and A. Bodanszky, wherein the parameters and techniques affecting the selection, use and removal of protective groups for individual and groups of amino acids is detailed, and which also contains activation and coupling techniques and other special procedures. However, before the application of these peptide chemistry techniques may be applied, certain key intermediates containing the activated electrophilic ketone moiety must first be prepared. The preparation of the key intermediates is described as follows. For those compounds wherein X₁ represents either CF₂H or CF₃, the key intermediates required for the application of the standard peptide coupling techniques are compounds of formula IIIa b wherein X 1 is CF₃ or CF₂H, and R₂ is as previously defined in formula I. Similarly, designations R₁, R₂, R₃, R₄, R₅ and Y shown in the following reaction schemes A through D are as defined in formula I, except that any subgeneric or other modifications thereof as in X 1 are highlighted by the use of a primed symbol with a specific designation for such modified symbol. The preparation and application of these compounds is depicted by Reaction Scheme A. wherein R₆ is alkyl, phenyl or other equivalent moiety, and X 1 is CF₂H or CF₃. In general, the formation of the substituted azlactones VI is effected from the N protected amino acids V by standard reaction conditions wherein the amino acid derivative V is heated in the presence of an acid anhydride. The so produced azlactone VI is reacted with a di or trifluoroacetic acid anhydride or acid halide to give a fluorinated intermediate which with or without isolation is treated with anhydrous oxalic acid to produce the N protected fluorinated ketone VII whereupon the ketone is chemically reduced to its alcoholic amide VIII. The amide VIII is cleaved under standard acidic conditions to yield its amide acid salt e.g., its hydrochloride IX . After neutralization, the alcohols IIIa may be coupled to R₁ using standard peptide chemistry techniques to produce compounds X which are subjected to the Swern oxidation procedure to obtain the desired products XIa and XIb the ketone or hydrate respectively . Alternatively, the alcohols IIIa may be oxidized to the ketones IIIb which are coupled to R₁ according to standard peptide chemistry techniques. When employing this alternative route, the amino moiety is first protected with a Boc protecting group, the OH function oxidized to its ketone via Swern oxidation procedures, and then the Boc protecting group removed and the resulting compounds IIIb are then coupled to R₁. In effecting the foregoing reactions, standard and well known techniques analogously known are utilized, for example, the azlactones VI are chemically transformed to their di or trifluoromethyl derivatives their X 1 derivatives VII by heating the azlactone and the fluoroacetic acid anhydride or acid halide reactants at temperatures of about 30 to 200 C for about 1 24 hours although under very mild conditions it may take up to one week preferably using molar equivalent quantities of the reactants. In the event excess quantities of the anhydride reactantaze used, such excess should be removed before the next step and the crude product is treated with anhydrous oxalic acid. The fluorinated ketone is reduced to its alcohol using excess quantities of sodium borohydride or any other suitable reducing agent, e.g., sodium cyanoborohydride. Following reduction, the reaction is quenched and the amide is cleaved under standard acidic conditions in water, alcohol or other hydroxylic solvent. The solution is made basic and extracted to obtain the corresponding alcohol IIIa . It is, of course, obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art that the conditions of the steps of Reaction Scheme A may have an impact on the R₂ side chain and thus procedures will have to be taken to protect those R₂ moieties which are not compatible with the various reaction conditions. For example, R₂ moieties which belong to Group E are generally compatible. Similarly, R₂ side chain radicals from Groups F, J, and G are compatible. Radicals of Group A need protection. Since arginine may be considered as a derivative of ornithine, the ornithine derivative may first be prepared and then converted to the arginine side chain otherwise the guanidino function of the arginine moiety will have to be protected. The Group C radicals of serine, threonine and cysteine must be protected, preferably with an ether e.g., benzyl ether . Preferably, the OH and SH functions of these groups are protected before the azlactone is formed. The X intermediate wherein X 1 is CF₃ and R₂ is H is known For those compounds wherein X₁ represents CO₂R₃, CONR₃ or COR₅Y, the key intermediates required for the application of the standard peptide coupling techniques have the formula with R 3 being as previously defined for R₃ except that H is omitted from its definition. The preparation and application of these compounds may be depicted by the following reaction scheme. NB. The desired stereochemistry at the N substituted carbon is obtained unless otherwise noted. wherein A and R 5 is other than zero. Compounds XIII are generally known starting materials. In general, such materials may be prepared by converting the appropriate L amino acid to its ester, preferably its methyl ester by standard esterification procedures e.g., SOCl₂ in the presence of alcohol , the ester is N protected, preferably with di t butyl dicarbonate Boc . The so protected R₂ amino acid is chemically reduced to the desired aldehydic form XIII of the N protected amino acid, preferably with diisobutylaluminum hydride Dibal all such procedures being by techniques well known in the art. Of course, other procedures for obtaining the same end products are readily available by techniques well known in the art. The reaction steps of Reaction Scheme B also use standard and well known techniques. For example, conversion of the aldehydes XIII to the corresponding cyanohydrin is effected by reaction with a bisulfite e.g., NaHSO₃ to obtain a bisulfite addition product XIV which is treated with a metallocyanide e.g., KCN to produce the corresponding cyanohydrin XV . Of course, other procedures are readily available for the conversion of the aldehyde to the cyanohydrin derivatives XV . The cyanohydrins are heated in a mixture of an aqueous acid and water miscible solvent such as an ether preferably dioxane to form the desired hydroxy acid XVI as a mixture of its diastereoisomers. These compounds are subjected to neutralization and purification by standard procedures, such as ion exchange resin chromatographic techniques, to yield products which are esterified to obtain the desired key intermediates XII . In effecting B a , the amino esters XII are coupled with the R₁ moiety according to standard peptide coupling techniques, taking care that the protective group utilized if any are selectively cleavable over the CO₂R 3 moiety. Oxidation of the coupled products is best achieved with the Swern reaction to convert the alcohol to its keto form which, as noted above, can exist in equilibrium with its hydrate. In effecting B b , the ester XVII is treated with an amine R₃NH₂ to give the amide XIX which may be oxidized via the Swern oxidation procedures to its keto amide XX . In this instance oxidation conditions other than that of the Swern conditions may also be employed e.g. oxidation with pyridinium dichromate . In effecting B c , the keto ester XVIII is treated with a base e.g., LiOH to give its keto acid XXI except in the case when R₁ contains a terminal methoxysuccinyl moiety in which case the R 3 must be selectively cleavable, e.g., R 3 ought to be t butyl or benzyl which are selectively cleaved under acidic or hydrogenolysis conditions respectively. In effecting step B d the keto acid XXI is converted to its amide by standard coupling procedures. In effecting B e , the acid is coupled with R₅Y according to standard procedures, taking care to protect and deprotect as needed in the light of the various groups in the definition of R₅ and Y. In reaction B f the ester XVII is converted to an amide and the amide oxidized according to Swern oxidation conditions. As noted above following the discussion of Reaction Scheme A , the conditions of the foregoing reactions in the obtention of the desired intermediates and final products of Reaction Scheme B are effected taking care that the R₂ side chain radicals are compatible. Although Groups E, F and G are generally compatible, protection of some R₂ side chains will be necessary. For example, histidine will have to be protected, while tyrosine and tryptophan ought be protected in order to improve overall yields. Again, ornithine must have its terminal delta amino group protected and ornithine may be converted to arginine. A protecting group would also be needed on a guanidino group. All amino aids, eg. cysteine and threonine having reactive groups in their side chain preferably are protected. In the preparation of those compounds wherein X₂ is the intermediates will be those compounds of the formulae which compounds may be prepared and applied according to Reaction Scheme C. The azlactone VI is prepared as in Reaction Scheme A and the steps going from VI to XXV are analogous to those of that Scheme except that the azlactone is treated with an unsaturated fluorinated carboxylic acid anhydride, and the product is treated with anhydrous oxalic acid to produce compounds XXV. Utilizing these intermediates XXV several pathways may be utilyzed to obtain the desired products. In one pathway C 1 the intermediate is sequentially subjected to a a chemical reduction of the electrophilic ketone, and b hydrolysis of the amide by standard procedures prior to coupling the R₁ moiety. The coupling is readily accomplished using standard peptide chemistry coupling procedures already referenced to produce compounds of formula XXVI these intermediates are also available for alternate pathways, i.e., C 1a or C 1b. In pathway C 1a the intermediates are sequentially treated with a ozone according to standard ozonolysis procedures to produce the corresponding ozonide, b treatment with dimethylsulfide to convert the ozonide to its aldehydic form and c oxidation, preferably using the Jones oxidation procedure to produce compounds of formula XXIVa. These compounds XXIVa are sequentially subjected to a R₅Y coupling and b Swern oxidation reactions according to already described standard procedures. In those instances wherein it is desired to first protect the hydroxy group, pathway C1 b is available. This pathway essentially mimics C 1a except that the hydroxy function is protected prior to ozonolysis and the hydroxy protecting group i.e. R₇ is removed in preparation for the Swern oxidation reaction. Typical protecting groups compatible with the described reactions can be used. Preferably the methoxyethoxymethyl group is utilized and is readily removed prior to the Swern oxidation by standard techniques such as by treatment with Zn Br₂. In pathway C 2 the intermediates are direct subjected to the above described sequential reactions ozonolysis, treatment with DMS, and oxidation to produce compounds of formula XXIX which in preparation for R₅Y coupling are converted to the spiro lactones of formula XXX. Coupling, and deprotection if necessary produce the desired compounds XXXI using standard techniques. Pathway C 3, a variation of pathway 6 1b, first reduces the electrophilic ketone to a hydroxy function which is protected with a suitable protecting group e.g. methoxyethoxymethyl and the resulting compounds XXVI are subjected to a ozonolysis, treatment with DMS, and the Jones oxidations, b R₅Y coupling and deprotection reactions, and c Swern oxidation, all of these reactions being done according to the above described procedures for these reactions to produce the desired compounds of formula XXXI. In those instances wherein difluorinated acid anhydrides are required for the preparation of the fluoromethyl azlactones, such anhydrides may be prepared by reacting tetrafluoroethylene F₂C CF₂ with an R₄CH CHCH₂OH reactant in the presence of a base e.g. NaH and the so desired R₄CH CHCH₂OCF₂ CF₂H intermediate is treated with butyllithium to produce an acid fluoride which is converted to its anhydride by standard procedures. Here again, it is obvious that compatibility features must be facilitated to ensure that the relevant groups can withstand the butyllithium reaction thus the R₄ moiety has to be protected when incompatible with the butyllithium reaction. For those compounds wherein X₂ represents the key intermediates useful for the preparation of the compounds of formula I bearing this group will be of the formulae the preparation and application of which is depicted by Reaction Scheme D. wherein P g is a protecting group suitably stable to the reaction steps involved and which in selectively cleaved following R₅Y coupling and the initial alkylation of XXXIV, R ₅Y is as defined for R₅Y except that R₅ optionally contains a protecting group. Following the initial step of alkylating the N protected aldehyde of formula XXXIV with an appropriate halide in the presence of zinc, the steps following the obtention of compounds XXXV follow the analogous procedures already described for Reaction Schemes A C. Having generally described the procedures by which the compounds of this invention may be prepared, the following specific examples serve to further illustrate the standard techniques and procedures which may be utilized to prepare the enzyme inhibitors of this invention I .
