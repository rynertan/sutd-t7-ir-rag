By properly arranging the correct reading character s in a type support member to form one or more correctly assembled words clearly visible to the operator, correct printing of the word s is achieved by the mirror image characters on the opposite side. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is a primary object of the present invention to provide a novel educational toy type printing devil that facilitates accurate type wetting for printing correct reading character s or word s . In one aspect of the invention, the type printing device comprises type removably mounted in a type support member. The type has a first character on one side that is readable from that side, and a second character on the opposite side that is a mirror image of the first character when read from the opposite side. The type is mounted within the support member with the second character extending through an opening in the support member for making a correct reading print when the second character is inked and moved into engagement with a receiving sheet. The type support member further has eans for releasably holding the type therein, and see through means in the type holding means through which the first character can be viewed to assure that the type is correctly mounted in the type support member to make a correct reading print. In another aspect of the invention, the type support member has one or more nests tor receiving the type. In still another aspect of the invention, each type is L shaped and has first and second capital letters on opposite sides respectively of one leg, and first and second small letters on opposite sides respectively of the other leg. Each leg of the type is selectively mountable within a nest for printing the letter thereon onto a receiving sheet. In more specific aspects of the invention, the type holding means comprises a pressure plate movable between an open position to allow placing type in the nests in the type support member, and a closed position for engaging and holding the type in the nests. The see through means comprises a transparent portion of the pressure plate. The transparent portion is in register with the letters on the type when the plate is in its closed position. An advantage, for example, of the type printing device of this invention is that it solves the problem of improperly setting the type while attempting to acnieve a correct reading print of one or more words. Where the type is set by viewing the mirror image of the correct letters or words from the printing side of the type, it is easy, particularly for a child, to improperly set the type. This problem is eliminated by setting the type in accordance with the correct reading letters or words on the type viewed from the side opposite the printing side.This printing device further sharpens the reading and spelling skills of the user. The invention and its advantages will become more apparent from the detailed description of the invention presented below.
