## Description
A Process for Producing Phosphoric Acid and or Phosphates from WetProcess Phosphoric Acid and an Extractant used therein. This invention relates to a process for producing pure phosphoric acid and or phosphates by extracting wet process phosphoric acid, and a new extractant used therein. It is well known that there are varying quantities of dissolved and suspended impurities such as calcium, iron, silica, aluminum, fluorine and magnesium etc. in wet process phosphoric acid. An extensive literature on removing the aforesaid impurities efficiently and economically for producing pure phosphoric acid and salts thereof both in study and industrial practice is available. One method of reducing these impurity levels is to extract PO P205 from wet process phosphoric acid into an appropriate organic solvent, which is then stripped by pure water, alkali solution or ammonia according to intended products. The method of solvent extraction extraction has been proved acceptable and efficient. Up to now, extractants for the above purpose could be classified into groups 1 alcohols, usually monohydroxy alcohols having fpur to eight carbon atoms such as butanol, i amyeol, hexanol, heptanol or octanol etc. 2 trialkyl phosphates, such as tributyl phosphate TBP 3 mixtures composed of different kinds of extractants such as the mixture consisting of alcohol, ketone and ether and the mixtures of phosphorylcontaining compounds and amines. In early United States patents U.S. 1,929,441, 1,929,442 and 1,929, 443 , C.H. Milligan proposed alcohols as extractants. In 1957, A.M. Baniel and R. Blumberg in Isreal patents 9,539 and 9,660 suggested n butyl alco hol ae extractant. And later, many kinds of extractants for phosphoric acid have been published in order to improve the extracting effect. DE A 2,822,303and 2,356,881 and U.S. 4,024,225 dleclosed alcohol, ketone and ether respectively. All the eaid extractants, however, are eoluble in water to a varying extent, 8o that an expensive recovery system of the appropriate solvent is neccessary. U.S. 3,438,764 reported organic aulfoxides and USSR 492,481 the mixture of TBP and petroleum sulfoxide for the same purpose. Unfortunatly also here solvent recovery is needed, due to its considerable solubility in water. TBP was selected for extracting wet process phosphoric acid in USSR 710,925. And the mixture of TBP, trlalkylamlne and alcohol was used byUSSR 596,542. In USSR 856,979, an extractant consisting of trialkyl phos phine oxides, trialkylamine and styrene copolymer was put forward. Although anine can raise the extraction efficiency, the use of it nay lead to formation of emulsions during the process. And its unknown toxic property limits the production of food grade phosphates. The use of pure trioctylphosphine oxide TOPO for the mentioned process has been studied in the laboratory. As for its difficult preparing method and high cost thereof, it is hard to say whether there is anything commercially valuable in it. The object of the preeent invention is to provide a process and an extractant of the abovementioned kind which make solvent recovery unnecessary, avoid emulsion formation and toxicity problems and are highly selective and efficient at low cost. According to the invention this task is solved by a process of the abovementioned kind which is characterized in that the wet process phosphoric acid is extracted with a water immiscible solvent mixture comprising a mixture of trialkyl phosphine oxides as extractant and a suitable water immiscible diluent to form a loaded solvent mixture phase and a raffinate phase. The extractant according to the invention for producing pure phosphoric acid and or phosphates is characterized by a mixed trialkyl phosphine oxides HTRPO having the following formula EMI3.1 wherein R1, R2 and R3 are same or different alkyl groups of 5 to 9 carbon atoms and the total number of carbon atoms per molecule is from 15 to 27. Purther preferred embodiments of the invention can be seen from the respective subelaims. In other words, in a preferred embodiment, the invention provides a process for making pure phosphoric acid and or phosphates from wetprocess phosphoric acid, which comprises 1 extracting about two thirds of P 0 from the crude acid with a water immiscible solvent mixture consi 25 sting of a mixture.of trialkyl phosphine oxides and a suitable water immiscible diluent, then 2 stripping the loaded solvent mixture with pure water, an alkali solution or gaseous ammonia to produce corresponding phosphoric acid in high purity or phosphates both for high grade fertilizers and for food and pharmaceutical uses, and 3 neutralizing the raffinate containing about one third of the left P2O5 with calcium carbonate to make precipitated calcium hydrogen phosphate as common fertilizer. Another result or the invention is to provide a new type or extractant for extracting phosphoric acid, which is a mixture of trialkyl phos phine oxides, particularly the mixed trialkyl phosphine oxides HTRPO . The mixed trialkyl phosphine oxides has a promising trend towards commercializing, for its high selectivity, low solubility in water, high extraction efficiency and simple preparing process, all of which result in low cost. The objects and advantages of the present invention will be further understood through following description and attached drawing, wherein figure 1 is a schematic flow diagram of an example of the basic process. The crude acid is fed by line 1 to extractor 2, and the loaded organic phase by line 3 subsequently enters into stripper 4 to which pure water, alkaline solution or gaseous ammonia is introduced through line 6, with inorganic phase out by line 7 and stripped organic solvent by line 5 returning to the extractor 2 as recycling extractant. The raffinate from extractor 2 by line 8 and calcium carbonate by line 10 are fed into digester 9 separately. After neutralization in digester 9, the precipitate of phosphate of calcium and partial impurities is separated from the mother liquor and discharged through line 12, and the clear mother liquid ie drawn off through line 11. The wet process phosphoric acid from decomposition of phosphate rock with sulfuric acid is used as a starting material in the present invention in which the concentration of P O is from 5 to 402 by weight. The crude 25 acid is contacted with a water immiscible solvent mixture consisting of extractant and diluent in countercurrent flow, while about 2 3 of P2O5 in the acid is extracted into the solvent mixture, and the balance of about 1 3 of P2O5 remains in the raffinate. The one used here is a new type of extractant disclosed by the invention. That is a mixture of trialkyl phosphine oxides, and preferentially is the mixed trialkyl phosphine oxides HTRPO which is a mixture having the following formula EMI5.1 wherein R1, R2, R3 are same or different alkyl groups with 5 to 9 carbon atoms respectively, and the total number of carbon atoms per molecule is from 15 to 27. The average molecular weight of the mixed trialkyl phos phine oxides is 312. It is a red brown liquid and has excellent selectivity. This means that its extracting ability for phosphoric acid is higher than that for the impurities. Hence, most of the impurities remain in raffinate during the extracting process.The loaded solvent, essentially free of impurities, is adapted for preparing pure phosphoric acid and high grade phosphates, especially dihydric potassium phosphate and dihydric ammonia phosphate. A comparison of selectivity coefficient for the mixed trialkyl phosphine oxides, TBP and trioctyl phosphine oxide TOPO is shown in Table 1, from which it is clear that the selectivity of the mixed trialkyl phosphine oxides is better than that of a single trialkyl phosphine oxide. Another feature of the mixed trialkyl phosphine oxides is its low solubility in water. While diluted with 40S kerosine, its solubility in water is only 90 PPM, much lower than that of TBP 380 PPN or other adopted monohydroxy alcohols under the same diluting conditions.The pro cess is hence simplified, for no recovery system for solvent has to be used. Besides, the extracting ability of the mixed trialkyl phosphine oxides is also good, as it has a high distribution coefficient listed in Table 2 . Compared with other extractante such as TBP and alcohols, higher recovery for phosphoric acid with leee theoretical extraction stages can be obtained. Table 1Composition of solvent mixture selectivity coefficient to Ng t 60 kerosine by volume 40 HTRPO 4.5 402 TOPO 3.3 aox TBP 2.1 The diluents proposed in the present invention can be selected from aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons or paraffin oils, and kerosine is preferred. Ae for the reason of physical property, a high proportion of extractant may increase difficulties in stripping. Consequently the ratio of extractant to diluent should be a proper value.The chosen proportion by volume of extractant to diluent is from 5 1 to 1 5, preferably 3 2 By adjusting the ratio of solvent mixture to crude acid by volume which is 1 1 to 4 1 and extraction stage in the extraction step, about 2 3 of P205 can be taken out from the crude acid. It is preferable to use a phase ratio between 1.5 1 and 2.5 1. The extraction is operated at a temperature ranging from 5 to 350C, preferably 250C. The contacting time in extraction is from 1 to 10 minutes. The loaded solvent from extraction step is then stripped with pure water, aqueous alkali solution or gaseous ammonia in conformity with production purposes. When stripped with pure water for producing pure phoephoric acid, the temperature is from 50 to 900C , preferably from 70 to 800C when stripped with an alkali solution such as poHaastuç for producing high purity KH2P04, it is operated at ambient temperature when stripped with ammonia for producing pure dihydric ammonia phosphate, the temperature is from 20 to 600C. The water immiscible organic phase from stripping step is recycled to the extraction step as extractant. The raffinate containing about 1 3 of the left P,O from the extrac 25 tion step is neutralized with calcium carbonate until all the P 205 is exhausted, and the formed secondary calcium phosphate CaHP04.2H20 , i.e.precipitated phosphate, precipitates with impurities from the raffinateq The small amounts of Fe, Ca, Mg, Al and F etc. in it are of benefit to the growth of plants, and the product can be used as cheap common fertilizer. So much less polluting effluent would have to be treated and discharged. The overall percentage recovery of P2O5 in this process is as high as 98 or more. It should be concluded from the above statement that the process of the invention is characterized by its high recovery ratio, simple process, less capital investment and less polluting problem. So it is economically valuable to commercialize the process. The mixed phosphine oxides HTRPO can be prepared by following methods 1 A mixture of monohydroxy alcohols of 5 to 9 carbon atoms having boiling point from 160 to 1900C reacts with iodine first, forming alkyl iodides. These then react with red phosphorus and nitric acid, followed by collecting fractions of the resulting compounds by vacuum distillation within a range of temperature from 160 to 260 0C under 110 to 120mmHg of absolute pressure as the mixed trialkyl phosphine oxides. 2 The mixed monohydroxy alcohos as stated in method 1 react with chlorinated sulfoxide first, forming alkyl halides. Theee then react with magnesium to produceGrinnard reagent, which is further treated with trichloride phosphorine oxide, followed by collecting fractions of the resulting compounds by vacuum distillation at temperature from 160 to 2600C under 110 mmHg of abeolute pressure as the mixed trialkyl phosphine oxides. Method 2 is simple and does not have to consume red phosphorus and iodine, both of which are not easy to recover. As a result, the production cost is lower than that by method 1. The mixed trialkyl phosphine oxides produced by either of the mentioned methods is a red brown liquid at room temperature. It is a mixture of trialkyl phosphine oxides of 15 to 27 carbon atoms, having average molecular weight of 312. The composition of the aforesaid mixture of monohydroxy alcohols is as follows C5H11OH 5 252, C6H130H 30 402, C7H15OH 20 4aX, C8R17 H 5 15S and C H OH 5 15S. 9 19 The starting material for preparing the mixed trialkyl phosphine oxides HTRPO can be chosen from the by product of high grade lubricant production. Besides its cheap price, the produced HTRPO in mixed form needs no further purification. Consequently the cost of the mixed trialkyl phosphine oxides is much lower than that of a single trialkyl phossphine oxide. Compared with trioctyl phosphine oxide TOPO , the cost is only 5S of TOPO s. It is one of the main objects of the invention to use the mixed trialkyl phosphine oxides as extractant.The invention is described in further details in the following examples. Example 1 100 ml crude phosphoric acid containing 18.6S P 205 was placed in a separating funnel. Using kerosine as diluent, the acid was extracted at temperature of 300C by HTRPO, TBP and isoamyl alcohol respectively with 1 weight ratio of the solvent mixture to the crude acid and 5 minutes of contacting time. Table 2 below illustrates the distribution coefficients of phosphoric acid at different proportions of extractant to diluent. Table 2 composition of solvent mixture volume S distribution coefficient 40S HTRPO 60 kerosine 0.23 60S HTRPO 40S kerosine 0.32 80S TBP 20S kerosine 0.19 100X TBP 0.26 100S isoamyl alcohol 0.03 Example 2 According to the flow sheet in figure 1, the crude phosphoric acid containing l9.67S P205 or 240 g l P205 , o.28 Fe203, 0.03S A1203, 0.66S CaO, 0.272S MgO and 0.6S P by weight was first introduced into extractor 2 and was extracted by a solvent mixture consisting of 60S by volume of the mixed trialkyl phosphine oxides and 40S by vloume of kerosine at 25 C. The flow rates of the acid and the solvent mixture are 3.96 l hr and 2.611 l hr respectively. The loaded solvent mixture was then stripped by pure water with a flow rate of 1.32 l hr in stripper 4 at 80 C. The aqueous phase from bottom of the stripper was purified phosphoric acid containing 260 g l of P2O5. The raffinate containing 96 g l P205 from extractor 2 was then reacted with suspended calcium carbonate solution in digester 9. After the reactants eeparated, secondary calcium phosphate containing 27.7 P205 with impurities of 2.7us F, 3.411 Mg, 1.83S Pe and 0.66S Al by weight was obtained. The organic solvent from the stripper was recycled to extractor 2.The said extractor and stripper are all mixer settlers with dimensions of 10x10x11 cm and 10x30x12 cm respectively. The purified phosphoric acid contained by weight 21.3 P205, 0.5 F, 0.17S CaO, 0.38S MgO and 0.5S suspended materials. Example 3 As described in Example 2 and Figure l, the loaded solvent mixture was stripped by an aqueous solution of KOH in stripper 4, during which the value of PH was controlled at about 4.5. The aqueous phase from stripper 4 was then evaperated, scrubbed and dried in succession to yield product KH2PO4. The purity of the product was over 99.5S with impurities of 0.017 NgO, 0.7 Fe 0 and 0.18S F by weight. The data conform to the 23 State Standards of China GB 1274 77, which is the standard for the first grade pharmaceuticals. Example 4 As described in Example 2 and Fig 1, the loaded solvent mixture from extractor 2 was stripped with gaseous ammonia in stripper 4, during the process, the value of PH was adjusted to 7 and white crystals were formed immediately. The crystals were then washed free from the solvent adhered to the surface of it with ethanol. Upon analysis, the content of NH H P011 was more than 99 , and SO4 and Fe were 0.01S and 0.003 by weight respectively, which meet the demands of HG 3 1064 77 of The Code of Ministry of Chemical Industry of China. Example 5 1 Kg mixed alcohols, the by product from high grade lubricant production, was distilled in a distillating still, collecting 0.83 Kg fraction at temperature from 186 to 190 C. The fraction was put into a reactor. When the temperature reached 120 to 1250C, 1.10 Kg iodine of 99 purity was added, half an hour later, adding 0.6 Kg red phosphorus and maintaining the reaction at 70 C for another half an hour, producing trialkyl phosphine iodide complex R3PI2 I . The R3PI2 I, 1 Kg eodium hydroxide t400 g l NaOH and 500 ml nitric acid 500 g l HNO3 were added to hydrolyzer to carry out hydrolysis. Through distillating the tydrolyzate under 110 mmHg absolute pressure, 0.74 Kg fraction was collected at temperature of 160 to 260 C.The infra red spectra and element analysis showed that the fraction was a mixture of trialkyl phosphine oxides containing 15 to 27 carbon atoms. And its average molecular weight is 312. Example 6 0.83 Kg distilled mixed alcohols as quoted in Example 5 was reacted with 1 Kg chlorinated sulfoxide in a reactor, forming 0.85 Kg of alkyl chlorides. The latter was reacted with 0.3 Kg of magnesium powder and 1 Kg ethyl ether as solvent for half an hour, then adding 1 Kg trichlorine phosphine oxide for another one hour of reacting. Finally the resulting compounds was di8t1X1ed under 110 mmHg absolute pressure collecting 0,81 Kg fraction at the range of temperature from 160 to 200 C, which was the mixed trialkyl phosphine oxide HTRP0 in accordance with requirements of the invention. Its average molecular weight was 312. The aforementioned Example 5 and 6 methods to produce the extractant according to the invention are useful even without relation to the process for producing phosphoric acid and or phosphates according to this invention. The features disclosed in the foregoing description, in the following claims and or in the accompanying drawing may, both separately and in any combination thereof, be material for realising the invention in diverse forms thereof.
