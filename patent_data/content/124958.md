## Description
A STYRENIC POLYMER AND A PROCESS OF PREPARING THE SAME The present invention relates to foamable or foamed styrenic polymers and to a process for the preparation thereof. In the prior art, foamed polymeric materials have been produced utilizing a variety of techniques. One common method comprises integrating within the polymeric material, which is in the form of beads or pellets, a blowing agent, such as pentane, for example, and subsequently utilizing such expandable beads or pellets to form the desired foamed product by extrusion, cavity molding or any other desired molding process. Another prior art extrusion system for the formation of foamed or cellular polymeric material is what is commonly ref erred to as a direct injection extrusion operation wherein the blowing agent is injected directly into a molten mass of foamable polymeric material and the desired foam material is extruded, as a sheet or tube, for example, in a single continuous operation.Both prior art systems are largely dependent for successful operation upon the selection of a proper cell size control additive to ensure proper cell size of. the final products. It has now been found that styrenic polymers in foam or foamable fortn can be produced so that the foam will have a uniform cell size by the incorporation in the styrenic polymer of a finely divided high molecular weight polymer nucleating agent which is insoluble in the styrenic polymer. According, the invention resides in one aspect in a process of preparing a styrenic polymer in foam form comprising, incorporating within the styrenic polymer a uniform dispersion of a polymeric nucleating agent which has a weight average molecular weight greater than 10,000 and is insoluble in said styrenic polymer and foaming the styrenic polymer with a foaming agent to yield a foam having a substantially uniform cell size. In a further aspect, the invention resides in a styrenic polymer containing a uniform dispersion of a finely divided polymeric nucleating agent having a weight average molecular weight greater than 10,000, insoluble in said styrenic polymer at least at the temperature employed during creation of a foam cell network in said styrenic polymer by means of a foaming agent. The high molecular weight polymer used as the nucleating agent herein must be insoluble in the styrenic polymer at least at the temperature of the styrenic polymer at the time of creation of the foam network. By high molecular weight is meant a weight average molecular weight of greater than about 10,000. The nucleating agent can be incorporated within the styrenic polymer during formation of the styrenic polymer, i.e. incorporated therein in situ.Alternatively, the nucleating agent can be incorporated into the foamable styrenic polymer after the formation of the styrenic polymer. Thus, a foamable preformed styrenic polymer containing the nucleating agent can result either from an in situ incorporation or from incorporation after the polymer has been formed. In addition, the nucleating agent can be incorporated within the foamable styrenic polymer as an integral process step in the creation of the styrenic foam structure. By this is meant, that sometime during the melt stage of the styrene polymer foam process, the nucleating agent can be dispersed therein. It is believed that any finely divided high molecular weight polymer which is insoluble in the styrenic polymer, at least at the time of the formation of a foam network by means of a foaming agent, can be employed. These polymeric nucleating. agents include the nylons, polycarbonates and polyimides but generally that class of polymers known as fluoroplastics is preferred.By fluoroplastics is meant any plastic based on polymers made from monomers containing one or more atoms of fluorine or copolymers of such monomers with other monomers, the fluorine containing monomer being in the greatest amount by weight ASTM D 883 . The fluoroplastics contemplated include polytetrafluoroethylene, fluorinated ethylene propylene copolymers perfluoroalkoxy resins, ethy lene tetrafluoroethy lene copolymers and polyvinylidene fluoride. Particularly preferred among the fluoroplastics is polytetrafluoroethylene in powder form. These materials all should have a weight average molecular weight of greater than 10,000. An especially preferred polymer is a commercially available Teflon powder identified as DuPont DDC 6000 and having a mean particle size of about 0.6 microns. The foamable polymers used herein are styrenic polymers and preferably are polymers of styrene, p methylstyrene, alphamethylstyrene, and any monomer mixtures thereof. Polystyrene and poly p methylstyrene are especially preferred. The polymeric nucleating agent must be present in an amount and in a particle size sufficient to yield an at least substantially uniform fine cell foam in the ultimately foamed styrenic polymer. The amount of nucleating agent generally will range from 0.001 to 0.5 by weight of the styrenic polymer prior to the foaming thereof. An effective mean particle size for the nucleating agent is from 0.1 to 10 microns.Particularly preferred is a mean particle size of about 0.6 microns. After the subject nucleating agent is effectively incorporated within the selected sytrenic polymer, the styrenic polymer can be converted into foam form by any conventional process.Two such foaming processes are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,482,006 and 3,444,283. If the nucleating agent is incorporated into the styrenic polymer in situ any of the techniques for the polymerization of the monomeric material can be employed, such as anionic polymerization, bulk polymerization, emulsion polymerization, solution polymerization and suspension polymerization.Example I A mixture of styrene 200 ml , pentane foaming agent 1,000 ml , styrene butadiene AB block copolymer 0.2 gm containing 40E styrene and having a molecular weight of 225,000 and Teflon powder 0.2 gm DuPont DLX 7000 was polymerized with 1. 5N butyl lithium 1.2 ml by stirring overnight at room temperature. The product was isolated by filtration and consisted of spherical particles 0.05 0.2 mm in diameter. This product was expanded by foaming the same in boiling water. The resulting product was a uniform small cell foam product having a bulk density of approximately 3 lbs. ft3. 48 kg m3 Example II The process was repeated but with the exclusion of the Teflon powder. The resulting polymer beads were expanded as in Example I. A non uniform cell structure was present in the foam product.Example III Bulk polymerization of styrene was carried out by heating styrene 180 ml , ethyIbenzene 20 ml and Teflon 0.03 gm DuPont DLX 7000 at UOOC for 6 hours and the resultant mixture devolatilized. The resulting polymer foamed to a fine cell foam structure after saturating with pentane, without the addition of a separate nucleatfng agent.Example IV Example III was repeated using p methylstyrene monomer instead of styrene. The resulting polymer foamed to a fine cell foam structure without the addition of a separate nucleating agent.Example V As an example of the general process disclosed in U.S. PatentNo. 3,482,006 and the incorporation of the fluoroplastic nucleating agent into the melt,polystyrene foam can be prepared as follows Polystyrene resin pellets are admixed with polytetrafluoethylene powder having a mean particle size of about 0.6 microns such that the nucleating agent constitutes 0.02S by weight based upon the total weight of the polystyrene being charged. These materials are continuously fed into a hopper of, for example, a 2 1 2 inch 6.4 cm diameter screw extruder having a length to diameter ratio of 24 1. The extruder is operated at an extrusion rate of about 150 Ibs. 68 kg per hour. By means of extruder barrel heaters, the portion of the extruder barrel surrounding the feedzone of the extruder is maintained at a temperature of about 220 F. 1040C . In the heat plasticizing zone, the pentane injection zone, and the mixing zone, the extruder barrel is maintained at a temperature of about 4000 to 4500F. 204 to 232or . About 5 by weight of pentane, based upon the total weight of resin and nucleating agent, is injected into the polystyrene composition at a point beyond the feed zone where the polystyrene is in a molten condition. The molten mass is then passed through the extruder mixing zone and a cooling zone where it is cooled to 290a 3200F. 143 1600C , and then extruded through an annular die orifice as a tubular foamed sheet. The tubular foam is passed about and over a mandrel designed to assist in maintaining a substantially uniform diameter within the extruded foam polymer tube. Thereafter, a knife or other cutting means cuts through one wall of the extruded tube and the same is opened to form a single wide sheet of extruded foam which can thereafter be wound into a roll for subsequent storage or use during thermoformation. The foregoing technique employing the polytetrafluoroethylene nucleating agent yields a fine uniform cell foam structure.
