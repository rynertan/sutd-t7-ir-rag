# Magnetic recording and or reproducing element.

## Abstract
A magnetic recording and or reproducing element 31 comprises a main element body 40 , and windings wound around the main element body. The main element body has a pair of extremely thin layers 43, 44 made from a ferro magnetic material, and the extremely thin layers oppose each other at respective edges thereof so as to constitute a gap 45 . Each of the thin layers is sandwiched between a pair of support members 46 49 which are made from a non mag netic and abrasion proof material. A contact surface 56 is formed on a vertex part of the main element body, for making contact with a magnetic recording medium 22 so as to record and or reproduce a signal on and or from the magnetic re cording medium. The main element body has one or a plurality of side surfaces 52 55 which form a predetermined angle with respect to the contact surface and define the peripheral edge of the contact surface so that the contact surface has a predetermined shape with an extremely small area and has the gap at an approximate center of the predetermined shape.
