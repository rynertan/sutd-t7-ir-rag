A valve for a pressurized fluid containing cylinder having a plunger 6 axially moving along a seating provided in a first hollow block member 2 suitable for connection of the cylinder to a consumer, said plunger 6 being opened by the connecting operation against the counteraction of a spring means 9 . In order to prevent the unauthorized refilling of the cylinder without disassembling of the valve 1 , a second block member 5 closely cooperates with the first block member 2 and is provided with a shutter 12 which, after the first filling operation of the cylinder, is moved in a posi tion which allows the exiting of the pressurized fluid from the cylinder but hinders the refilling of the same cylinder unless the valve 1 is completely disassembred.
