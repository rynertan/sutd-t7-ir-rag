## Description
The present invention relates to aircraft navigational systems and methods for automatically creating aircraft navigational guidepoints, utilizing VOR navigational equipment in conjunction with a digital computer and computer controlled display. More particularly, the invention relates to an aircraft navigational system as described in the preamble of claim 1. Such a system is known from US A 4.413.322. For instrument navigation, most aircraft rely on a number of VHF omnirange stations VOR which are geographically situated throughout the world. These VOR stations transmit electronic signals in a 360 direction which, when received by navigational equipment aboard the aircraft, indicate to the aircraft pilot the aircraft bearing to the station if the aircraft if equipped with distance measuring equipment DME the VOR signal received by the aircraft will also indicate the distance of the aircraft to the VOR station VOR station is also referred to as a navigational station of NAVAID. The combination of bearing and distance information allows a pilot to pinpoint his location relative to the NAVAID, and by utilizing navigational charts which show the exact geographical location of the NAVAID, the precise location of the aircraft can be determined. To display the electronic position data transmitted by the NAVAID, the pilot relies upon a VOR receiver which can be manually tuned to the discrete transmitting frequency of the particular VOR station which the pilot chooses to navigate by. The pilot then selects a particular VOR radial by manually selecting that radial at the VOR receiver. The VOR display equipment in the aircraft then displays the aircraft geographic position relative to the selected radial as well as distance from the NAVAID, information hereinafter referred to as place bearing distance PBP information. PBD data can be utilized to create navigational points to guide the aircraft along its route thereby allowing the pilot much more flexibility in planning the route of the aircraft these place bearing distance navigational guidepoints are also known as waypoints . Many of the sophisticated aircraft navigational systems include a programmable digital flight management computer FMC for programming flight navigational information prior to takeoff the flight navigational information including guidepoints and active flight plan data defining the planned route of travel of the aircraft. Also included is a control display unit CDU for controlling the navigational system and displaying data to the aircrew and a horizontal situation indicator HSI for displaying the navigational information such as the geographic location of NAVAIDS and guidepoints on a CRT screen located in the cockpit. The HSI displays the NAVAID guidepoints and flight path legs on the CRT together with the present position of the aircraft relative to those navigational points so that the aircrew has a pictorial presentation of the aircraft s journey. The flight management computer can be coupled to the aircraft s flight control system to automatically fly the planned route. In order to allow the computer to be programmed in flight, the cockpit is equipped with an alphanumeric keypad accessible to the aircrew. Sometimes in flight modification of the flight path is necessary due to traffic conflicts or weather changes. The aircrew enters the desired flight path into the computer by entering the guidepoints defining the modified flight path, the flight path information is then displayed at the CDU and the geographical locations of the guidepoints are symbolically displayed at the HSI. It is desirable that any in flight programming by the aircrew be accomplished as quickly and as easily as possible. Present day commercial airline aircraft are now being designed for operation by two pilots instead of three, government approval of the two pilot commercial airline aircraft being based on an aircraft design which allows for safe aircraft operation by a two pilot crew. The use of NAVAIDS in conjunction with aircraft VOR receivers to automatically create navigational guidepoints is of itself not new. In U.S. Patent No. 4,313,322 Foster, et al, there is disclosed an area navigation device which automatically establishes guidepoints along a preselected course line intersecting with any one of four radials of a VOR station. This system, however, cannot accomodate changes in the pre programmed flight plan, since it depends on a predetermined straight line emanating from the aircraft s current position for the creation of new waypoints. Furthermore, the system as taught in this patent does not give the aircrew a free choice of the location of the new waypoints, as they must necessarily be located on both the predetermined course line The present invention therefore has for its object to provide an aircraft navigational system as described in the preamble of claim 1, which will enable aircrews to quickly and surely perform in flight modifications of the planned flight path in respons to ATC requirements or weather changes. According to the invention, this is accomplished in that the computer means is arranged to provide a connecting line between the guidepoints indicating the flight path, the connecting line comprising a plurality of successive segments having various bearings, and each segment being defined by at least two guidepoints, and the radial selection means is arranged to select any radial having a bearing between 0 and 360 . In a preferred embodiment of the navigational system of the invention, input means are provided for entering information defining a selected distance from a selected geographical location and for feeding a navigational distance signal defining the selected distance from the selected geographical location to the computer means, and the computer means is arranged to respond to the navigational distance signal and to provide a third informational signal indicating a point of intersection of the connecting line with the navigational distance to define a second new guidepoint, and to store data defining the second new guidepoint in the memory. Thus, an aircrew is quickly provided with a point on the flight path which is at a selected distance from e.g. an airfield. In another preferred embodiment, the input means is arranged to enter information defining a selected bearing from the selected geographical location and to feed a navigational radial signal defining the selected bearing from the selected geographical location to the computer means, and the computer means is arranged to respond to the navigational radial signal and to provide a fourth informational signal indicating a point of intersection of the navigational distance with the navigational radial to define a third new guidepoint, and to store data defining the third new guidepoint in the memory. Thus, the aircrew may easily create a guidepoint which is not part of the original flight path. The navigational system according to the invention may further comprise selection means for allowing an aircraft pilot to select guidepoints stored in the memory for in conjunction with the new guidepoint defining new segments of the connecting line. These and other objects and advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent upon reading the following detailed description and upon reference to the attached drawings in which Referring to FIG. 1, there is shown an aircraft navigational system comprising a navigational computer 10 interconnected with a control display unit 12, and a horizontal situation indicator 14 horizontal situation indicator 14 includes a character generator 16 and a CRT screen 17 for the cartographic display of NAVAIDS, guidepoints, aircraft route of flight, and selected radials as shown in FIG. 2, as well as aircraft track and heading information. CDU 12 and CRT 17 are located in the aircraft cockpit to interface with the aircrew. Control display unit CDU 12 includes an alphanumeric keypad 18, with dedicated mode keys, which is a primary method for entering flight navigational data into computer 10, as well as selecting modes of operation, and for controlling the display of data at CRT screen 17 and display window 20 located on the front of CDU 12. CDU 12 includes a FIX page, illustrated in FIG. 3A, wherein place bearing distance data pertaining to a selected geographical location stored in computer 10 can be alphanumerically displayed and modified, e.g., FIX ABC. CDU 12 also includes a LEGS page, illustrated in FIG. 3B, including a separate line for a leg of the flight plan, wherein a data field listing each fix defining each leg of the flight plan can be alphanumerically displayed and modified on individual lines of the page by pressing an appropriate line select key 21 located at either side of CDU window 20. A place bearing distance may be transferred from the FIX page to the LEGS page via the CDU scratchpad by pressing the line select key 21 adjacent to the selected line. The place bearing distance is placed on the selected line of the LEGS page corresponding to the leg of the flight plan wherein the place bearing distance entry lies. For example, FIX ABC FIG. 3A may be transferred to the CDU scratchpad by pressing corresponding line key 21. By calling up the appropriate LEGS page and pressing the corresponding line key 21, FIX ABC may be line selected to the appropriate location in the flight plan route. Computer 10 is a programmable digital computer including permanent memory for storage of NAVAID data including the respective latitudes longitudes and named identifiers thereof, and ii selected geographical reference points GRPs including the respective latitudes longitudes and named identifiers thereof. Geographical reference points GRPs define geographical locations along the route of flight which are automatically displayed at CRT 17 and CDU window 20, or which may be accessed by their named identifier via keypad 18 for display at CRT 17 or CDU window 20. Computer 10 includes temporary memory for the storage of active flight plan data including guidepoint place bearing distance data, as well as selected reference points SRPs which define pilot selected geographical locations and which are entered as a latitudes longitudes via keypad 18 for display at CRT 17 and window 20. Computer 10 also includes an arithmetic unit for performing calculations to create a flight plan route utilizing the geographical locations of selected NAVAIDS, GRPs, SRPs, guidepoints and other navigational reference information. Computer 10 determines the track to be flown between these flight plan geographical locations and displays the track information cartographically and alphanumerically at CRT 17 FIG. 2 . For definition purposes, a guidepoint is typically an identified magnetic bearing and distance from a NAVAID, geographical reference point GRP or selected reference point SRP . However, a guidepoint may be more broadly defined as any geographical location which is defined by a known latitude and longitude, such as for example a NAVAID, GRP OR SRP. Navigation and position data is supplied from computer 10 to symbol generator 16 which generates the required symbology and interface signals for CRT display. The data supplied by computer 10 includes i map background information such as flight path and location of guidepoints, NAVAIDS, GRPs, SRPs and airports relative to the aircraft, and ii airplane dynamic data such as track and ground speed, time of distance to next guidepoint and computed winds. The display at CRT 17 includes two modes i a map mode wherein the aircraft position is dynamically displayed relative to the flight path and to other earth references data such that the display is dynamically changing around the aircraft, and ii a plan mode wherein a portion of the flight plan route is displayed statically in reference to a guidepoint along the route. All of the symbols are drawn on the face of CRT 17 using known stroke writing techniques. It will be appreciated that the software necessary to generate the above mentioned symbology is known in the art and within the knowledge of one having ordinary skill in the art. Preferably, the aircraft navigational system of the present invention utilizes air navigational equipment, currently aboard the Boeing 757 767 aircraft as of February, 1985, manufactured by Sperry Flight Systems of Phoenix, Arizona, including Sperry Flight Management Computer which bears Part Number 404 6833 944, Sperry Control Display Unit which bears Part Number 403 8170 905 and a Symbol Generator Manufactured by Rockwell International, Collins Division, which bears Part Number 622 5045 030, and Rockwell CRT which bears Part Number S2422404 601. Utilizing the preferred aircraft navigational equipment, there is shown in FIG. 2 a typical map mode presentation at CRT 17 for providing navigational information to the aircrew. There is shown at CRT 17 a computer generated compass heading display 19 and a heading marker 20 for providing the heading of the aircraft relative to magnetic north. In order to provide a cartographic display of the projected aircraft track, i.e., flight path, there is shown a vertically oriented track display line 32 which represents a line joining two or more geographical locations stored in computer 10 FIG. 1 and displayed via character generators 16. In order to provide a visual display of the geographical location of the aircraft relative to the projected flight path 32, an aircraft symbol 34 is provided at the lower end of track 32. Continuous inputs from the aircraft s inertial navigation system are provided to computer 10 to display aircraft symbol 34 at a proper geographical location relative to flight path 32. During inflight operation of the aircraft, the aircrew continuously monitors and corrects for changes in the aircraft s position relative to the projected flight path 32 by viewing CRT 17. Also displayed at CRT 17 are the preprogrammed geographical locations of selected NAVAIDS, GRPs, SRPs and waypoints such as VOR station 31, identified as ADE , and geographical reference point 35, identified as ABC . In the map mode position in which the aircraft position is displayed dynamically relative to the earth reference geographical locations, a pictorial display of the forward movement of the aircraft is provided by computer 10 and character generator 16 wherein earth reference points, such as NAVAIDS, GRPs and SRPs, are continuously moving in a downward direction relative to aircraft symbol 34. As the aircraft continues on its flight, new NAVAIDS, GRPs and SRPs are displayed at the top of CRT screen 17 in order to represent the progress of the aircraft along its projected route of flight. CDU 12 includes a FIX mode key for selection of a FIX page. Selected geographical fixes including NAVAIDS and GRPs may be entered into the FIX page at keypad 18 utilizing the assigned identifier, whereas an SRP may be entered into a FIX page as a latitude longitude. A symbol identifying the selected fix is then displayed at CRT 17 FIG. 2 . Selected radials may be entered into the CDU FIX page at keypad 18 which are displayed at CRT 17 as radials emanating from the selected fix. In addition, a selected distance may be entered into the FIX page at keypad 18 which is displayed at CRT 17 as a circle located circumferentially about the selected fix at a constant radius equal to the selected distance FIG. 12 . In a preferred embodiment of the invention illustrated in FIG. 1, the aircraft navigational system utilizes a VOR receiver 22 including a window 24 at the front thereof for displaying the VOR frequency selected by a dial 26 located below window 24, and a window 28 for alphanumerically displaying the VOR radial selected by a dial 29 located below window 28. VOR receiver 22 is interconnected with computer 10 for transfer of VOR navigational data thereto. Utilizing the present invention, navigational guidepoints are created by i the intersection of a track line joining two or more guidepoints, e.g., the aircraft projected flight path, with one or more selected radials selected ii intersection of a track line joining two or more guidepoints with one or more selected DME distances as shown in FIG. 14 or iii intersection of one or more selected radials with one or more selected distances as shown in FIG. 19. Although a preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to the creation of guidepoints by the intersection of VOR radials and DME distances with the track line, the present invention also includes the creation of guidepoints by i the intersection of a track line with radials emanating from GRPs and SRPs, ii the intersection of a track line with selected distances from the GRPs and SRPs, and iii intersection of GRP and SRP radials with GRP SRP selected distances. Referring now to FIG. 4, there is shown a map mode display of one embodiment of the present invention wherein one or more guidepoints are created by intersection of a line joining two or more guidepoints with one or more selected radials. Typically the line joining two or more guidepoints comprises the projected aircraft path however, it should be realized the the invention may be utilized to determine a new guidepoint which is defined by i a line joining two or more predetermined selected guidepoints, one or more of which do not define the aircraft projected flight path and ii a selected VOR radial. The graphical representation is displayed at CRT 17 of HSI 14, wherein there is displayed a pilot selected VOR radial 30 radiating from a pilot selected VOR station 31, radial 30 intersecting aircraft projected flight path 32 to create a new guidepoint 36 , located vertically above aircraft symbol 34. Pressing the FIX mode key of CDU 12 in conjunction with other selected keys causes a selected FIX page to be displayed thereon wherein place bearing distance data pertaining to the selected FIX may be displayed and modified. By placing VOR receiver 22 in a manual mode and entering a NAVAID identifier into the FIX page which has a corresponding VOR frequency selected at window 24, the radial 30 selected at VOR dial 29 is provided to computer 10 and symbol generator 16 for display cartographically at CRT 17. When radial 30 crosses a flight path leg, the place bearing distance of guidepoint 36 is automatically entered into the temporary memory of computer 10 and displayed on the FIX page. This place bearing distance data is line selected into the CDU scratch pad, moved to the LEGS page where the geographical guidepoints defining the route of flight are located, and entered as a new guidepoint in the flight plan. It should be appreciated that simultaneously with the display of NAVAID 31, guidepoints 36, flight path legs, and radial 30 at CRT screen 17, place bearing distance data defining NAVAID 31, guidepoints 36 and selected radial 30 are also displayed at window 20 of CDU 12 FIG. 1 in an alphanumeric format, e.g. SEA 090 27. Therefore, although it is possible to utilize the present invention without display of any one of or all of the following at CRT 17 NAVAID, guidepoint and flight path data, by utilizing a place bearing distance format displayed at CDU window 20, display of this navigational data cartographically at HSI CRT 17 provides a simpler and more efficient format for creating new guidepoints 36 . Prior to the present invention, there were several methods for creating and displaying new navigational guidepoints depending upon whether or not each guidepoint had been preprogrammed into the memory of computer 10. In the case where the new guidepoint was stored in memory, the pilot was required to enter the appropriate identifier for the desired guidepoint by pressing the appropriate buttons on CPU keypad 18. Generally the pilot referred to a code book for obtaining the appropriate identifier, or the pilot accessed a list of identifiers for display at window 20 by activating keypad 18. In the case where the guidepoint had not been preprogrammed into computer memory, the pilot was required to obtain the geographical location of each guidepoint, usually defined as a latitude and longitude, or bearing and distance from a specific NAVAID, and then enter this information into the computer by pressing the appropriate buttons on keypad 18. Referring to FIG. 5, there is shown a plurality of guidepoints 36 interconnected by a track or connecting line, indicated at 37, which comprises the aircraft projected route of flight. Adjacent guidepoints 36 define individual flight path legs 32 which comprise segments of the projected flight path. Aircraft 34 tracks these flight path segments 32 until reaching the vicinity of an airport 38 where aircraft 34 makes either a visual approach or an instrument approach and landing as weather and traffic conditions dictate. A typical situation may arise wherein the crew of aircraft 34 planned its flight to guidepoint 36x where a visual approach and landing at runway 02 was planned. Due to a change in the wind direction at airport 38, the duty runway is changed to runway 33. Waypoint 36x will not prepare aircraft 34 for an approach to runway 33, therefore a new approach guidepoint must be programmed into computer 10 by the pilot, and a distance and course to this new guidepoint must be determined. A guidepoint 36y was preprogrammed into computer 10 prior to flight and is now displayed on CRT 17, however, guidepoint 36y is an approach guidepoint to runway 27 and not usable as an approach point for runway 33. In order to create a suitable approach guidepoint to runway 27, prior to the present invention, the pilot accessed computer 10 via keypad 18 to determine if there was a guidepoint preprogrammed therein to provide an approach point to runway 33. If there was no preprogrammed guidepoint, the pilot obtained the geographical location of the suitable approach point, either as a bearing and distance from a suitable NAVAID or a latitude and longitude, and then entered this data into computer 10 via keypad 18. In contrast, however, in the present invention, the pilot rotates VOR receiver dial 29 FIG.1 until the selected radial 30 FIG. 5 crosses line segment 32 connecting guidepoints 36 and 36y, at the desired location. The numerical value of selected radial 30 is transmitted to computer 10 which determines the geographical location of the point of intersection to define a new guidepoint. The alphanumerical place bearing distance of the new guidepoint is determined by computer 10 in a manner to be described shortly and then transmitted to CDU 12 for display at the CDU FIX page. The pilot line selects this place bearing distance into the appropriate location on the LEGS page and executes this entry thereby entering guidepoint 36 into computer 10 for display at HSI CRT 17. A track line 32 connecting guidepoint 36 to guidepoint 36 and to destination 38 is displayed to provide a visual path for the aircrew to monitor when navigating aircraft 34 to new guidepoint 36 and on to destination 38. Referring now to FIG. 6, there is shown a flow chart describing an overview of a method for creation of guidepoint 36 in FIGS. 4 and 5. Initially, the latitude longitude of each guidepoint of the active flight plan is retrieved from the data base of flight management computer 10 the latitude and longitude of each flight path guidepoint typically preprogrammed into computer 10 prior to flight. The latitude and longitude of the aircraft is retrieved from the aircraft s inertial guidance system as needed. As the pilot selects a particular VOR station by selecting its frequency at dial 26, FIG. 1 the latitude and longitude of the VOR station is retrieved from a preprogrammed lookup table in computer 10. After tuning in the VOR station, the pilot selects the desired radial at VOR dial 30 FIG. 1 , with the remaining process steps resulting in the creation of a new navigational guidepoint 36 accomplished by computer 10 in conjunction with HSI 14 and CDU 12. Initially, the selected radial in degrees magnetic is converted to degrees true by adding or substracting the magnetic variation of the aircraft s present geographic location. The true bearing from the VOR station to each of the preprogrammed guidepoints including the aircraft s destination, as well as the true bearing from the VOR station to the aircraft, are determined to obtain a plurality of checkpoints so that each checkpoint is defined by its true bearing from the VOR station. The pilot selected VOR radial is then compared with each set of adjacent checkpoints starting at the aircraft s present position, to determine between which adjacent set of checkpoints the selected VOR radial lies. For example, in FIG. 7 there is shown a number of checkpoints as they would appear on CRT 17 of HSI 15. These checkpoints, designated 1 through 5, including guidepoints 36, destination 38 and aircraft location defined by aircraft symbol 34 are joined by flight path legs 32. The true bearing of each checkpoint from VOR station 31 is shown the selected VOR radial 30, e.g. 290 , lying between adjacent guidepoints 2 and 3, e.g. 270 and 305 . If a selected VOR radial lies between two sets of adjacent checkpoints as shown in FIG. 8, the set of adjacent checkpoints which are sequentially closer to the aircraft, i.e. guidepoints 3 and 4, are selected. After determining between which set of adjacent checkpoints selected radial 30 FIG. 7 lies, the latitude and longitude of the intersection point of flight path leg 32 with selected radial 30 is determined the intersection point defined as newly created guidepoint 36 . The latitude longitude of guidepoint 36 is then calculated in order to determine the true bearing and distance of guidepoint 36 from VOR station 31 thereby defining guidepoint 36 as a place bearing distance PBD from VOR station 31. A more detailed description of the present embodiment is provided by referring to the flow chart in FIGS. 9A and 9B wherein the number of remaining guidepoints NUMWPT , is defined as the number of checkpoints remaining in the aircraft route of flight the term checkpoints including the aircraft, destination and remaining guidepoints. After conversion of the selected VOR magnetic radial to true, the bearing from the VOR station to each of the checkpoints, i.e. guidepoints, aircraft and destination, is determined in the following manner. The great circle distance and true bearing between two geographical locations identified by their respective latitude longitude, such as between a VOR station and a checkpoint, are calculated by using known spherical geometric relationships. Referring to FIG. 10, there is shown a representation of the earth indicated at 40, including a true north point 42 atop thereof, and a center 44 a reference line 45 connects true north point 42 with earth center 44. Two guidepoints 36a, 36b located on the surface of earth 40 are also identified by their respective latitude and longitudes, LAT 1, LONG 1 and LAT 2, LONG 2 respectively. In order to provide a geometric representation of the geographic locations of guidepoints 36a, 36b, a distance 32 between guidepoints 36a and 36b is measured over the surface of the earth as a great circle distance GCD a great circle distance is defined as the shortest route between any two points on the earth s surface. The great circle distance between north point 42 and guidepoint 36a is identified as reference line 50 the great circle distance between north point 42 and guidepoint 36b identified as reference line 52. The radial distance between earth center 44 and guidepoints 36a, 36b respectively is represented by radius reference lines 56, 58 respectively. The angular distance between true north reference line 45 and radius reference line 56 is identified as an angle B, equivalent to an angle of 90 minus LAT 1 the angular distance between north reference line 45 and radius reference line 58 is identified as an angle A, equivalent to an angle of 90 minus LAT 2. The angular distance between radius reference lines 56 and 58 is identified as an angle C. An angle D identifies the angular distance between reference line 50 and flight path leg 32. In order to determine 1 the length of flight path leg 32, i.e. the great circle distance between geographical locations identified by their respective latitude longitudes, and 2 the true bearing angle D from guidepoint 36a to guidepoint 36b, the following derivation is utilized. A known geometric relationship, the law of cosines for sides of oblique spherical triangles, is Therefore In addition, it is known that Therefore and However, if LONG 2 is greater than LONG 1, then angle D angle D . After determination of the true bearing from the VOR station to each of the checkpoints, it is then determined, as previously discussed, between which set of adjacent checkpoints the selected VOR radial lies by comparing the true bearing of the selected VOR radial with the true bearings of each adjacent set of guidepoints, identified as I and I 1 respectively in FIGS. 9A and 9B. Once the guidepoints 36 which are adjacent to new guidepoint 36 have been determined, the geographic location of guidepoint 36 is determined by calculation of the great circle distance and true bearing from one of the adjacent guidepoints 36 to guidepoint 36 . Referring now to FIG. 11, there is shown a geometric representation of two guidepoints 36a, 36b and a NAVAID 31, the geographical locations of which are typically preprogrammed into computer 10 as part of the active flight plan route flight path leg 32 connecting guidepoints 36a, 36b. Selected VOR radial 30 intersects flight path leg 32 to create new guidepoint 36 at the intersection thereof. In order to determine the place bearing distance of guidepoint 36 from NAVAID 31 for display on HSI screen 17 and at CDU window 20 Fig. 1 , a great circle distance, identified as ZETA, defining the distance between guidepoint 36a and guidepoint 36 , together with the true bearing of guidepoint 36 from guidepoint 36a, are determined. In order to determine distance ZETA which comprises a line segment 61 between guidepoint 36 and guidepoint 36a, a true north reference line 62 intersects guidepoint 36a and selected radial 30 to form two right triangles 64 and 66 reference line 62 intersecting VOR radial 30 at a point where reference line 62 is perpendicular to selected radial 30. Reference line 62 defines a distance G between guidepoint 36a and selected radial 30. Referring first to triangle 64, there is included an angle E1 formed by the intersection of flight path segment 61 and true north reference line 62. By trigonometry, ZETA G cos E1 , distance G and angle E1 to be determined in the following manner. An angle D representing the true bearing of guidepoint 36 from guidepoint 36a is formed by the intersection of flight path leg 32 with true north reference line 62. Referring now to triangle 66, hypotenuse 70 thereof represents the great circle distance between VOR station 31 and guidepoint 36a, a distance determined in a manner discussed in Derivation No. 1. An angle E3 is formed by the intersection of selected radial 30 and hypotenuse 70. An angle E4 is formed by intersection of hypotenuse 70 and true north reference line 62. An angle E5 comprises the supplement of angle E4. An angle E is formed by the intersection of hypotenuse 70 and flight path leg 32. Distance G therefore is determined by multiplying the great circle distance between NAVAID 31 and guidepoint 36a GCD I by sin E3 , E3 representing the angle between the true bearing of selected radial 30 and the true bearing of guidepoint 36a, the true bearing of guidepoint 36a having been determined previously. In order to determine angle E1 of triangle 64 It should be appreciated that other trigonometric relationships may be used to compute distance ZETA. For example in triangle 66, G GCD I cos E4 , therefore, by substitution ZETA GCD I cos E4 cos E1 . Also, in triangle 64, ZETA G sin E6 E6 identifying an angle of triangle 64 formed by the intersection of flight path 32 and selected radial 30. The present invention includes all other equivalent methods of determining distance ZETA using known trigonometric relationships. In order to calculate the latitude and longitude of guidepoint 36 utilizing a known distance ZETA and true bearing angle D of guidepoint 36 from guidepoint 36a, a known latitude and longitude, the following derivation is used. Referring to FIGS. 10, the law of cosines for sides of oblique spherical triangles states that From the law of cosines for sides of oblique spherical triangles If angle C is between 0 and 179 , then After determination of the latitude and longitude of guidepoint 36 , the place bearing distance of guidepoint 36 relative to NAVAID 31 is determined by utilization of the equation derived in Derivation 1 for determining the great circle distance and true bearing between two geographical locations, each geographical location having a known latitude longitude. The place bearing distance data pertaining to guidepoint 36 is then formatted for display on HSI CRT 17 and CDU display window 20. In another embodiment of the present invention there is shown in FIG. 12, CRT 17 of HSI 14 wherein there are displayed distance circles 70 representing aircrew selected distance DME DIS , from a selected geographical location identified as FIX 71, which are input to computer 10 by the aircrew at CDU keypad 18 on the CDU FIX page. Also displayed at CRT 17 is aircraft 34 and flight path 32, which includes FIX 71 as a navigational point along flight path 32, as well as an alphanumerical display of the distance represented by circle 70 and other desired data such as altitude requirements. The conventional aircraft navigational system described previously and utilized on Boeing 757 767 commercial aircraft, has the capacity for displaying an arcuate flight path at CRT 17. These arcuate flight paths have been displayed in conjunction with straight lines to portray the aircraft projected route of flight including i an aircraft holding pattern which is typically a racetrack type of pattern which the aircraft flies while awaiting clearance by air traffic control ATC to an approach for landing, ii an arcing approach which requires the aircraft to fly an arcuate path to place the aircraft in position for landing, and iii a transition between two flight legs representing different courses wherein an arcuate path is used to connect the flight legs to provide a transition path for the aircraft to fly. In the conventional navigation system, an arcuate flight path was located and displayed at CRT 17 by providing to computer 10 the latitude and longitude of the starting point of the arcuate flight path and the ending point of the arcuate flight path, respectively, as well as the radius of the arc, the value of the angle which the arcuate path subtended between the starting and ending points, and the initial course of the arcuate path, which is defined as the initial direction of the arcuate path from the starting point relative to true north. A positive value for the subtended angle results in the arc being drawn in a clockwise direction a negative value for the subtended angle results in the arc being drawn in a counterclockwise direction. The initial course is dependent upon the location of the starting point relative to the center of the circle. For example, when the starting point bears 270 from the center of the circle, i.e., to the left of the center, the initial course from the starting point is north or 0 . In the present invention, however, it has been recognized that the display of selected circle 70 cartographically, as illustrated in FIG. 12, wherein the radius thereof represents a selected distance from FIX 71 provides the aircrew with a visual display of distance information relative to the aircraft and flight path. FIX 71 may be a NAVAID defined by the latitude longitude thereof, a GRP defined by the latitude longitude thereof and given an identifier such as BOY for access via CDU keypad 18 by the identifier, or an SRP defined by the latitude longitude thereof and entered via keypad 18 as a latitude longitude. Sometimes clearance is given by air traffic control ATC utilizing DME distances and altitude clearance limits that are independent of identified geographic locations. For example, a typical ATC clearance prior to a landing approach might read expert clearance to 15,000 feet at 55 DME from, for example, the Seattle VOR , and expect further clearance upon crossing the 30 nautical mile at 13,000 feet descending to 10,000 feet . As far as Applicants are aware, conventional systems provide no visual cartographic display of these DME distances in reference to the aircraft s position and projected flight path. It can be appreciated however, that the display of selected circle 70 may be utilized to provide the aircrew with the knowledge of the aircraft s position relative to the DME distances specified in the ATC clearances so that the aircrew is prepared for the altitude change instructions. In accordance with the present invention, the aircrew enters a selected distance in a required format via CDU keypad 18 at the CDU FIX page, where it is displayed alphanumerically as a selected distance from FIX 71. The distance data is transmitted to computer 10 which recognizes the circle format causing computer 10 and symbol generator 16 to display selected circle 70 at CRT screen 17 in a manner to be described hereinafter. As the aircraft 34 progresses along flight path 32, circle 70 and FIX 71 move in a downward direction relative to CRT 17 and aircraft symbol 34. When aircraft symbol 34 intersects with circle 70, the pilot is able to ascertain that the aircraft is at the selected distance identified in the ATC instructions, in preparation for the further altitude clearance instructions forthcoming from ATC. Location and display of selected circle 70 is accomplished utilizing the aircraft navigational system described previously on board Boeing 757 767 aircraft, and by referring to the flow chart in FIG. 13. A selected geographical location having a preprogrammed latitude longitude XLAT XLONG or a selected NAVAID 31 identifier, having a preprogrammed latitude longitude XLAT XLONG , together with a numerical value of the selected distance XRAD are entered into computer 10 at keypad 18 FIG. 1 . The latitude and longitude of a tangent point TANLAT TANLONG to a circle having a centerpoint XLAT XLONG and a radius equal to the selected distance XRAD is determined by selecting TANLAT to have a latitude equal to that of XLAT, and then converting this latitude into radians. TANLONG is determined by the equation The latitude and longitude of the tangent point TANLAT TANLONG is utilized as a starting latitude longitude and an ending latitude longitude for creation of circle 70. A subtended angle value of either 360 or 360 is preprogrammed into computer 10 unless a value of 360 is equated to 0 by computer 10, wherein a value less than 360 but substantially equal to 360 , such as 359.9 , is used. An initial course of 0 is preprogrammed into computer 10 for establishing the initial course for the creation of circle 70 when TANLAT is selected to have a latitude equal to XLAT and when the subtended angle is programmed as a positive value. An initial course of 180 is preprogrammed into computer 10 for establishing the initial course for creation of circle 70 when TANLAT is selected to have a latitude equal to XLAT and when the subtended angle is programmed as a negative value. In another embodiment of the present invention illustrated in Fig. 14, there is shown a representation wherein one or more guidepoints 36 are created at the intersection of a selected distance, represented by a circle 70, with the aircraft projected flight path 32. The representation, displayed at CRT 17 or HSI 14, includes flight path 32, aircraft symbol 34, selected geographical FIX 71 and distance circle 70, representing the selected distance DME DIS from FIX 71. As discussed previously, DME DIS is input to computer 10 by the pilot at the CDU FIX page to create a place bearing distance, which is then transferred to the CDU scratchpad, line selected to the proper location at the CDU LEGS page and displayed at CRT 17. Simultaneously with the display of the above navigational data cartographically at HSI CRT 17, data defining FIX 71, guidepoints 36 and the selected distance is displayed at CDU window 20 FIG. 1 in an alphanumeric format. It should be appreciated that creation of guidepoints 36 does not require the display of the selected distance as selected circle 70 at CRT 17 however, the display of selected circle 70 and flight path leg 32 provides the aircrew with immediate visual feedback of the intersection point prior to transferring the PBD data to the LEGS page and displaying the PBD data as a newly created guidepoint. It should be appreciated that the creation of navigational guidepoints at the intersection of the aircraft projected flight path of one or more selected distances is a rapid method of creating navigational guidepoints not available in conventional aircraft navigational systems. For example, an aircrew without the benefit of distance circle display 70 described previously receives a clearance from air traffic control to descend to 10,000 feet at 30 mile DME inbound to the Seattle VOR FIX 71 in FIG. 14 . The aircrew enters the selected DME distance via CDU keypad 18 in a required format at the CDU FIX page. The DME distance data is transmitted to computer 10 which utilizes the DME distance data, together with the geographical locations of NAVAIDS, GRPs and SRPs defining the projected route of flight, to determine the geographical location of the point of intersection in a manner to be described hereinafter. The point of intersection is displayed at the CDU FIX page as an alphanumeric bearing and distance, which is transferred to the LEGS page and line selected by the aircrew into the CDU scratch pad, moved to the LEGS page which the geographical guidepoints defining the route of flight are located, and entered as a new guidepoint in the flight plan. A track line 32 connecting guidepoint 36 to aircraft symbol 34 and to subsequent guidepoints 36, is displayed at CRT 17 to provide a visual path for the aircrew to monitor when navigating in reference to new guidepoint 36 . The point of intersection is displayed as a new guidepoint 36 which moves in a downward direction on CRT 17 relative to aircraft symbol 34 to provide a visual indication to the aircrew when the required descent to 10,000 feet is to be made. There is shown in FIG. 15 two sets of guidepoints guidepoints 36a, 36b, identified as LAT 1 1 LONG 1 1 , LAT 2 1 LONG 2 1 respectively, defining a flight path 32a which intersects the selected DME distance, represented by circle 70, on an inbound flight leg, and guidepoints 36c, 36d which are identified as LAT 2 2 LONG 2 2 , LAT 1 2 LONG 1 2 respectively, defining flight path leg 32b which intersects the selected DME distance on an outbound flight path leg. An inbound leg is defined as a flight path leg wherein the distance between flight path 32 and FIX 71 decreases as the aircraft travels along flight path 32 an outbound leg defined as a flight path leg wherein the distance between flight path 32 and FIX 71 increases as the aircraft travels along flight path 32. Referring now to FIG. 16 there is shown a flow chart describing an overview of a method of the present invention for the creation of guidepoints 36a , 36b FIG. 15 . Initially the latitude longitude of each guidepoint of the active flight plan is retrieved from the data base of flight management computer 10. The latitude and longitude of the aircraft is retrieved from the aircraft s inertial guidance system. After accessing FIX 71, the pilot inputs a selected distance into computer 10 at the FIX page of CDU keypad 18. Computer 10 then determines 1 whether or not the selected distance intersects the projected flight path, 2 which flight path leg the selected distance intersects, and 3 whether the flight path leg is inbound or outbound relative to the FIX 71. Using spherical geometry, the distance and true bearing between adjacent checkpoints comprising guidepoints 36, destination 38 and aircraft location defined by aircraft symbol 34, is determined to define the intersected flight path leg. In order to approximate the intersection point of the selected distance with the projected flight path, a halfway distance point between adjacent checkpoints which define the intersected flight path leg is determined, this halfway point designated as a temporary guidepoint identified as LATHALF LONGHALF Fig. 15 . The distance between the temporary guidepoint and one of the adjacent guidepoints is again halved, the new halfway point again defining a temporary guidepoint. This halving iteration continues until the intersection point comprising the newly created guidepoint is located within a predetermined tolerance. The intersection point latitude longitude and true bearing GCD from the FIX to the newly created guidepoint is then determined using spherical geometry, the result formatted as a place bearing distance for display at CDU window 20 and at CRT 17. A more detailed description of the present embodiment is provided by referring to the flow chart in FIGS. 17A and 17B wherein after calculation of the number of remaining checkpoints, the great circle distance from FIX 71 to each set of adjacent checkpoints is compared with the selected distance to determine through which flight path leg 32 or flight path legs 32a, 32b the selected distance DME DIS intersects, as shown in Fig. 18. The numerical value of the selected DME distance is located between the numerical values of the distances from FIX 71 to the set of adjacent checkpoints which define intersected flight path 32a. Once the adjacent guidepoints which define the intersected flight path leg have been determined, the geographical location of the intersection point comprising new guidepoint 36a is determined. In order to provide a geometric description for determination of guidepoint 36a , reference is made to FIG. 15 wherein the great circle distance from FIX 71 to guidepoints 36a, 36b, 36c, 36d is identified as D1 to FX 1 , D2 to FX 1 , D2 to FX 2 , and D1 to FX 2 respectively. A halfway point 62 is located equidistant from guidepoints 36a and 36b . Using the equation derived in Derivation No. 1 for determining the great circle distance and true bearing between two guidepoints identified by known latitude longitude, the great circle distance between guidepoints 36a and 36b is calculated and then divided in half to determine the GCD to midpoint 62. Using the equation derived in Derivation No. II for determining the latitude longitude of a second location using the GCD and true bearing of the second location from a first location having a known latitude longitude, the latitude and longitude of halfway point 62 is determined. Utilizing the latitude longitude of FIX 71 and halfway point 62 respectively, the great circle distance from halfway point 62 to FIX 71 DN to FX 1 is determined, and then compared with the selected DME distance DME DIS to determine through which segment of flight path leg 32 to the DME radius intersects the flight path segments defined by LAT 1 1 LONG 1 1 , LATHALF LONGHALF and LAT 2 1 LONG 2 1 , LATHALF LONGHALF respectively. For example, if DN to FX 1 10 miles, D2 to FX 1 5 miles and DME DIS 7 miles, then the segment of flight path leg 32a defined by LAT 2 1 LONG 2 1 and LATHALF LONGHALF intersects the selected DME distance. The latitude longitude of LATHALF LONGHALF is determined using the equation derived in Derivation No. II. The determination of the geographic location of guidepoint 36a continues by dividing the distance between LAT 2 1 LONG 2 1 and LATHALF LONGHALF in half to create two new flight path segments, comparison is then made between a new DN to FX 1 and DME DIS to determine through which of these new flight path segments the DME distance intersects. These successive calculations using increasingly smaller flight path segments continue until the tolerance limits DN to FX 1 DME DIS are reached, resulting in a close approximation of the latitude and longitude of guidepoint 36a utilizing the equation derived in Derivation No. II from which the great circle distance and true bearing of guidepoint 36a from FIX 71 is determined utilizing the equation derived in Derivation No. 1 for determining the great circle distance and true bearing between two geographical locations defined by the respective latitude longitude. The results are automatically entered into the temporary memory of computer 10 and then formatted for display as a place bearing distance on the FIX page of CDU 12, and then line selected into the CDU scratchpad, moved to the LEGS page, and entered as a new guidepoint 36a in the flight plan. In another embodiment of the present invention shown in FIG. 19, there is provided a map mode representation wherein new guidepoints 36 are created at the intersection of one or more selected radials and one or more selected distances from a selected geographical location. Waypoints 36 are created and displayed independently of selected guidepoints 36 and track line 32 therebetween. The representation, displayed in the map mode at CRT 17, includes FIX 71, DME circle 70, a radial 74, aircraft symbol 34 and flight path 32. As discussed previously, FIX 71 may comprise i a VOR NAVAID, ii a geographical reference point GRP defined as a latitude longitude given a named identifier and preprogrammed into computer 10, or iii a selected reference point SRP defined as a geographical location entered via keypad 18 as a latitude longitude. Radial 74 may comprise a pilot selected VOR radial entered via VOR receiver 22 when FIX 71 comprises a VOR NAVAID or radial 74 may comprise a pilot selected radial entered as a bearing from a selected GRP or SRP. The intersection of the selected distance, represented by circle 70, with radial 74 defines place bearing distance data which is displayed at the FIX page of CDU 12. Radial 74 and circle 70 are referenced to a common FIX 71, with radial 74 defining the bearing from FIX 71 and circle 70 defining the distance from FIX 71. The PBD data is line selected to the proper location on the LEGS page and then displayed as guidepoint symbol 36 at CRT 17 and as alphanumeric data at CDU window 20 a track line 32 connecting new guidepoint 36 to aircraft symbol 34 by and to subsequent guidepoints 36 is displayed at CRT 17 to provide a visual path for the aircrew to monitor when navigating in reference to new guidepoint 36 . Embodiments disclosed herein may be combined for display simultaneously or for display in various combinations depending upon pilot preference and projected flight path route restrictions.
