# Device for transporting and or spreading liquids.

## Abstract
A manure spreader comprises a tank 1 for receiving liquid manure from a pit 61 . The manure enters the tank 1 through a conduit 60 temporarily connected to an inlet 2 by a coupling device 46 . To spread the manure, a distribu tion member 16 is fitted to the inlet 2 which then serves as an outlet . A valve 3 is provided for shutting off the inlet 2 from the tank 1 . A control linkage 21 is provided for operating the coupling device 46 , the distribution member 16 and the valve 3 . The control linkage 21 in constructed so that the valve 3 only opens when the inlet 2 is connected to the conduit 60 or the distribution member 16 to avoid the unpleasant effects of accidental manure spillage.
