# A self protected sheathed resistor.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a temperature limiter particular ly useful with electric heater elements of the sheathed type. A switch is supported on the flange of the heater by fulcrum means which allow for the oscillatory movement of the switch relatively to the flange. The oscillation of the switch is actuated by a rod engaging both the sheath of the heater and the switch. The switch comprises a movable control pushbutton engaging the flange.
