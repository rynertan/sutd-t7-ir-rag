# TREATMENT OF ARTICLES HAVING A COATING OF A MOISTURE CURABLE COMPOSITION

## Abstract
A method of treating shoe parts having a coating of a moisture curable composition utilises an apparatus in which a support 16 for an article, e.g. a lasted shoe S, can be supported within a chamber 30 in which the support can be enclosed. The chamber 30 is supplied with heat and moisture. More especially, the article is subjected to infra red radiation from a heater 44 and steam is supplied to the chamber 30 such that the humidity of the atmosphere within the chamber 30 is maintained during the operating cycle at a dew point of between 50 and 60 C. The surface temperature of the heater 44 is between 250 and 420 C, preferably between 300 and 380 C, and the article is sub jected to infra red radiation for a period of between 5 and 25 seconds, preferably 10 seconds. Because the chamber 30 is enclosed, steam is supplied for only the first 5 seconds of the heating period. To facilitate work handling, the support 16 is movable between a loading unloading position and an operative position within the chamber 30 , and an arrangement of screens 52,54 is provided for closing the chamber respec tively in the loading unloading position and the operative position. The screens also serve to cause the steam created during a cycle of operation to be evacuated into ambient atmosphere at the end of each operating cycle.
