## Abstract
In a VTR having a rotary head cylinder 20 having four magnetic heads with 90 angular pitches inbetween on a cylindrical surface thereof, a magnetic recording tape is helically wound around the rotary head cylinder 20 , a motor to drive the rotary head cylinder 20 is servo controlled by utilizing output signal of a phase comparator 10 which compare a first frequency divider 62 to divide frequency of output signal of a rotation phase detector 7 into 2N N
