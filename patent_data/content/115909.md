# Improvements in gas fires.

## Abstract
The present invention discloses an open gas fire having a gas burner 1, 9 , the combustion products of which are fed to a flue system 21 via a heat exchanger 15 for use in providing heated convection air. With such gas fire constructions too much cold air can be drawn into the fire through the front of the fire due to the capacity of the flue system. The flue system 21 has to be able to cope with the maximum quantity of com bustion products which can be produced, to thus avoid spillage of the products from the front of the fire. At gas settings other than setting to produce the maximum combustion product, cold air is then drawn into the flue reducing the thermal efficiency of the fire. The present invention improves the thermal efficiency of the gas fire by providing an adjustable baffle 23 which is arranged to vary the flow through cross section of the path of the combustion products to the flue system 21 . Thus the flue cross section 21 can be matched to the combustion products quantity, reducing the quantity of cold air drawn into the front 3 of the fire and thus improving thermal efficiency.
