# Electrophotographic copying machine including an automatic document feeder.

## Abstract
The control system of an electrophotographic copier includes jam recovery arrangements. The copier employs an automatic document feed system for feeding original documents in turn from a stack to an exposure station. When a copy sheet jam occurs, the original document at the exposure station is registered in a register stack 232 of a data store 230 . The number of copies lost by jams are recorded in a copy count register stack 234 in the data store. At the end of the copying run from the original document stack, these can be reloaded and a further run processed using the data from the store to produce those copies lost during the first run. In order to assist re collation of the replacement copies into the set, blank sheets may be fed to the copy collection device in place of the copies lost by jamming.
