# Preparation of alkyl halides.

## Abstract
Alkyl halides are prepared by reacting an alcohol with a halogenating agent in the presence of a compound of a metal of Groups IA or IIA of the Periodic Table as catalyst. The performance of the catalyst is generally improved by the addition of a solubilising agent.

## Description
PREPARATION OF ALKYL HALIDES This invention relates to a process for the preparation of alkyl halides from organic hydroxyl compounds in which the hydroxyl group is attached to an aliphatic carbon atom. It is known that alcohols can be converted into corresponding chloro compounds by reaction with thionyl or sulphuryl chloride via an intermediate chlorosulphite or chlorosulphate ester. However yields of the desired product are low because of competing decomposition reactions. The provision of soluble chloride ions by the addition of a tertiary amine results in some improvement, but yields are still far from quantitative, particularly in the preparation of secondary alkyl halides. Furthermore, extended reaction times are often necessary to achieve a satisfactory level of chlorination even when amine catalysis is employed. We have now discovered that the use of an inorganic catalyst in such a halogenation reaction results in both a shorter reaction period and an increased yield of desired product. Contamination of the product with unwanted by products is also reduced. Thus according to the present invention there is provided a process for the production of an alkyl halide of formula I EMI1.1 which process comprises reacting an alcohol of formula II EMI2.1 R2 R2 and R3which may be the same or different, are e en atoms or alkyl groups containing 1 to 24 carbon atoms, may b2 substituted by aromatic or other inactive tituantsa with a halogenating agent in the presence of a compound ml of Groups LA or IrA of the Periodic Table. alerably R1 and R2 are alkyl groups containing 1 to 12 carbon na R3 is a hydrogen atom. certain cases, particularly strongly polar feedstocks, the may be derived by adding the free metal to the reactants to a e compound in situ, but more commonly a pre formed compound e used. Suitable catalysts include the chlorides, hydroxides, alkoxides nanoates of lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium, nesium, calcium, strontium and barium. the psrformance of the catalyst is generally improved by the on of a solubilising agent. Suitable agents include crown ers, polyalkoxy compounds containing three or more alkoxy groups molecule, such as dimethyl polyethylene glycol, and dipolar, solvents, such as dimethyl sulphoxide. referred halogenating agents are chlorinating agents such as ml chloride and sulphuryl chloride. e reaction is suitably effected at a temperature in the range 220 C, preferably in the range 750 to 850C. Pressure is not a significant parameter and the reaction is are OSt conveniently carried out at ambient pressure. the molar ratio of alcohol to halogenating agent is suitably in inge 1 1 to 1 5, preferably 1 1 to 1 1.5. quantity of catalyst employed is preferably in the range v by weight, expressed as a percentage by weight of the reaction may be effected in the presence or, preferably, once of a solvent. Suitable solvents include 1,2 dichloroethane, toluene and chloroform. The invention is illustrated with reference to the followingExamples. Example 1 is not in accordance with the invention and provided for comparison. Example 1 1.3g O.OlM octan 2 ol was heated with with stirring at 80 C with 1.43g 0..12M thionyl chloride. The product was isolated 7 pumping in vacuo. After 4.5 hours 13C NMR Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy indicated the production of 31Z by wt octyl chloride 34 chlorosulphite, 114 oct l ene, 10 cis oct 2 ene and 10 trans oct 2 ene. Example 2 3.0g 0.03M octan 2 ol was heated stirring at 80 C with 4.29g 0.036M thionyl chloride and 39 mg 1 by wt lithium hydroxide monohydrate 39 mg, 1Z . The product was isolated as before. After 3 hours 13C NMR spectroscopy indicated the production of 43 by wt octyl chloride, 4X chlorosulphite, 11X oct 1 ene, not. cis oct 2 ene, 16 trans oct 2 ene and 10 other material. Example 3 3.9g 0.03M octan 2 ol was heated with stirring at 800C jt 4.29g 0.036M thionyl chloride, 39 mg 1 by wt lithium hydroxide monohydrate and 160 mg l2 crown 4 ether. The product was isolated as before. After 0.5 hours 13C NMR spectroscopy indicated an octyl chloride content of 75X by wt. No remaining chlorosulphite could be detected and other product levels were 2X oct l ene, 3.5X cis oct 2 ene, 5.5X trans oct 2 ene and 142 other material. A canparison of Examples 1 and 2 shows that using a lithium hydroxide catalyst increases both the reaction rate and the yiel desired product. Example 3 shows that these effects are greatly enhanced by Lhe addition of 12 crown 4 ether as a solubilising agent for the catalyst.
