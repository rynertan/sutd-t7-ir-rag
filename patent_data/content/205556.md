## Description
This invention relates to the production of graphitic carbon fibrils having high surface area, high Young s modulus of elasticity and high tensile strength. More specifically, it relates to such fibrils grown catalytically from inexpensive, readily available carbon precursors without the need for usual and expensive graphitizing temperatures approximately 2900 C . Fiber reinforced composite materials are becoming increasingly important because their mechanical properties, notably strength, stiffness and toughness, are superior to the properties of their separate components or of other non composite materials. Composites made from carbon fibers excel in strength and stiffness per unit weight, hence are finding rapid acceptance in aerospace and sporting goods applications. Their high cost, however, inhibits their wider use. Carbon fibers are currently made by controlled pyrolysis of continuous filaments of precursor organic polymers, notably cellulose or polyacrylonitrile, under carefully maintained tension, needed to insure good orientation of the anisotropic sheets of carbon atoms in the final filaments. Their high cost is a consequence of the cost of the preformed organic fibers, the weight loss in carbonization, the slow rate of carbonization in expensive equipment and the careful handling necessary to avoid breaks in the continuous filaments. There has been intense development of methods of spinning and carbonizing hydrocarbon pitch fiber to reduce precursor filament cost and weight loss. So far, the pitch pretreatment, spinning conditions and post treatments needed to insure correct orientation of the sheets of carbon atoms in the final products have been nearly as expensive as the previously noted method involving organic polymers. Both methods require use of continuous filaments to achieve high orientation and best properties. There is a practical lower limit of fiber diameter, 6 to 8 µm, below which fiber breakage in spinning and post treatments becomes excessive. An entirely distinct approach to carbon fiber formation involves the preparation of carbon filaments through the catalytic decomposition at metal surfaces of a variety of carbon containing gases, e.g., CO H₂, hydrocarbons, and acetone. These filaments are found in a wide variety of morphologies e.g., straight, twisted, helical, branched and diameters e.g., ranging from tens of angstroms to tens of microns . Usually, a mixture of filament morphologies is obtained, frequently admixed with other, non filamentous carbon cf. Baker and Harris, Most reports that cite formation of filamentous carbon do not document the particular type of filaments formed, so that it is impossible to determine whether the filaments are suitable for reinforcement applications. For example, Baker et al., in GB A 1,499,930 1977 , disclose that carbon filaments are formed when an acetylene or diolefin is decomposed over catalyst particles at 675 775 C. No description of the structure of these filaments is given, however. In EP A 56,004 1982 , Tates and Baker describe the formation of filamentous carbon over FeO Several groups of workers have disclosed the formation of straight carbon filaments through catalytic decomposition of hydrocarbons. Oberlin, Endo, and Koyama have reported that aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene are converted to carbon fibers with metal catalyst particles at temperatures of around 1100 C, Carbon Tibbetts has described the formation of straight carbon fibers through pyrolysis of natural gas in type 304 stainless steel tubing at temperatures of 950 1075 C, It has now unexpectedly been found that it is possible to catalytically convert hydrocarbon precursors to carbon filaments substantially free of pyrolytically deposited thermal carbon, and thereby to avoid the thickening stage reported in the prior art as overlapping and concomitant with the filament lengthening stage. This ability allows the direct formation of high strength fibrils useful in the reinforcement of matrices, in the preparation of electrode materials of very high surface area, and in the shielding of objects from electromagnetic radiation. This invention concerns an essentially cylindrical discrete carbon fibril characterized by a substantially constant diameter between 3.5 and 70 nm, e.g. between 7 and 25 nanometers, length greater than 10² times the diameter, an outer region or multiple essentially continuous layers of ordered carbon atoms and a distinct inner core region, each of the layers and core disposed substantially concentrically about the cylindrical axis of the fibril. The entire fibril is substantially free of pyrolytically deposited thermal carbon. The inner core of the fibril may be hollow or may contain carbon atoms which are less ordered than the ordered carbon atoms of the outer region, which are graphitic in nature. The fibril of this invention may be produced by contacting a catalyst comprising iron supported on alumina with a gaseous, carbon containing compound at a temperature sufficiently high to form fibrils, yet low enough to avoid significant thermal decomposition of the gaseous carbon containing compound with formation of pyrolytic carbon, the ratio on a dry weight basis of carbon containing compound to catalyst being at least 100 1. The contacting of the metal containing particle with the carbon containing compound may be carried out in the presence of a compound, e.g. CO₂, H₂ or H₂O, capable of reaction with carbon to produce gaseous products. Suitable carbon containing compounds include hydrocarbons, including aromatic hydrocarbons, e.g. benzene, toluene, xylene, cumene, ethylbenzene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, anthracene or mixtures thereof non aromatic hydrocarbons, e.g., methane, ethane, propane, ethylene, propylene or acetylene or mixtures thereof and oxygen containing hydrocarbons, e.g. formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acetone, methanol, or ethanol or mixtures thereof and include carbon monoxide. The suitable catalyst comprises an iron containing particle which may have a diameter between 3.5 and 70 nanometers, and which is supported on a support of alumina. In one embodiment the surface of the metal containing particle is independently heated, e.g. by electromagnetic radiation, to a temperature between 850 C and 1800 C, the temperature of the particle being higher than the temperature of the gaseous, carbon containing compound. In a specific embodiment, the metal containing particle is contacted with the carbon containing compound for a period of time from 10 to 180 min at a pressure of from 10,13 to 1013 kPa. In this embodiment, the gaseous carbon containing compound is benzene, the reaction temperature is between 900 C and 1150 C and the ratio of carbon containing compound to catalyst is greater than 1000 1. The contacting may be carried out in the presence of gaseous hydrogen. In addition to the above mentioned method and carbon fibril produced thereby this invention also concerns a method for producing a substantially uniform plurality of essentially cylindrical, discrete carbon fibrils which comprises contacting a catalyst comprising iron supported on alumina with a gaseous, carbon containing compound at a temperature sufficiently high to form fibrils, yet low enough to avoid significant thermal decomposition of the gaseous carbon containing compound with formation of pyrolytic carbon, the ratio on a dry weight basis of carbon containing compound to catalyst being at least 100 1. Preferably, each of the fibrils so produced has a diameter substantially equal to the diameter of each other fibril. In one embodiment the metal containing particles are pre formed. The fibrils are useful in composites having a matrix of e.g., an organic polymer, an inorganic polymer or a metal. In one embodiment the fibrils are incorporated into structural materials in a method of reinforcement. In other embodiments the fibrils may be used to enhance the electrical or thermal conductivity of a material, to increase the surface area of an electrode or an electrolytic capacitor plate, to provide a support for a catalyst, or to shield an object from electromagnetic radiation. Fig. 1. Numerous 10 45 nm diameter fibrils, together with catalyst support and reaction debris. Fig. 2. A fibril with a diameter of approximately 25 nm, together with catalyst support and reaction debris. An essentially cylindrical carbon fibril may be produced in accordance with this invention, said fibril being characterized by a substantially constant diameter between 3.5 and 70 nm, a length greater than 10² times the diameter, an outer region of multiple layers of ordered carbon atoms and a distinct inner core region, each of the layers and core disposed concentrically about the cylindrical axis of the fibril. The entire fibril is substantially free of pyrolytically deposited thermal carbon. The term cylindrical is used herein in the broad geometrical sense, i.e., the surface traced by a straight line moving parallel to a fixed straight line and intersecting a curve. A circle or an ellipse are but two of the many possible curves of the cylinder. The inner core region of the fibril may be hollow, or may comprise carbon atoms which are less ordered than the ordered carbon atoms of the outer region. Ordered carbon atoms, as the phrase is used herein means graphitic domains having their In one embodiment, the length of the fibril is greater than 10³ times the diameter of the fibril. In another embodiment, the length of the fibril is greater than 10⁴ times the fibril diameter. In one embodiment, the fibril diameter is between 7 and 25 nm. In another embodiment the inner core region has a diameter greater than 2 nm. More specifically, a method for producing an essentially cylindrical, discrete carbon fibril according to this invention comprises contacting a catalyst, i.e., a discrete iron containing particle supported on alumina, with a precursor, i.e., a suitable gaseous, carbon containing compound, at a temperature between 850 C and 1200 C. The ratio on a dry weight basis of carbon containing compound precursor to iron containing particle catalyst is suitably at least 100 1. It is contemplated that a variety of carbon containing compounds are suitable as precursors when used with an appropriate combination of reaction parameters, in accordance with this invention. In one embodiment, exemplified herein, the precursor is benzene. Other contemplated suitable precursors include hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. The hydrocarbon precursor may be aromatic, e.g. benzene exemplified herein , toluene, xylene, cumene, ethylbenzene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, anthracene or mixtures thereof. Alternatively, the hydrocarbon may be non aromatic, e.g. methane, ethane, propane, ethylene, propylene or acetylene or mixtures thereof. The hydrocarbon may also contain oxygen, e.g. alcohols such as methanol or ethanol, ketones such as acetone, and aldehydes such as formaldehyde or acetaldehyde or mixtures thereof. Important reaction parameters, in addition to the particular precursor, include catalyst composition and pretreatment, catalyst support, precursor temperature, catalyst temperature, reaction pressure, residence time or growth time, and feed composition, including the presence and concentrations of any diluents e.g., Ar or compounds capable of reaction with carbon to produce gaseous products e.g., CO₂, H₂, or H₂O . It is contemplated that the reaction parameters are highly interdependent, and that the appropriate combination of reaction parameters will depend on the specific precursor carbon containing compound. In this invention, the catalyst comprises preferably a particle having a diameter between 3.5 and 70 nm and contains iron. In one embodiment, the catalyst is contacted with the carbon containing compound in the presence of a compound capable of reaction with carbon to produce gaseous products. In one such embodiment, the compound capable of reacting with carbon is CO₂, H₂, or H₂O. It is desirable that catalyst particles be of reasonably uniform diameter and that they be isolated from one another, or at least held together in only weakly bonded aggregates. The particles need not be in an active form before they enter the reactor, so long as they are readily activated through a suitable pretreatment or under reaction conditions. The choice of a particular series of pretreatment conditions depends on the specific catalyst and carbon containing compound used, and may also depend on other reaction parameters outlined above. Exemplary pretreatment conditions are provided in the Examples which follow. The iron containing particles may be precipitated as metal oxides, hydroxides, carbonates, carbonylates, nitrates, etc., for optimum physical form. Well known colloidal techniques for precipitating and stabilizing uniform, very small particles are applicable. For example, the techniques described by Spiro et al. for precipitating hydrated ferric oxide into easily dispersable uniform spheres a few nanometers in diameter, are very suitable for catalyst preparation, J. Am. Chem. Soc. For ease of removal, the preferred physical form of the alumina is thin films or plates which can easily be moved into and out of the reactor. The reaction temperature must be high enough to cause the catalyst particles to be active for fibril formation, yet low enough to avoid significant thermal decomposition of the gaseous carbon containing compound with formation of pyrolytic carbon. The precise temperature limits will depend on the specific catalyst system and gaseous carbon containing compound used. For example, benzene is kinetically thermally stable to 1100 C, methane to 950 C, and acetylene to 500 C. In cases where thermal decomposition of the gaseous carbon containing compound occurs at a temperature near or below that required for an active, fibril producing catalyst, the catalyst particle may be heated selectively to a temperature greater than that of the gaseous carbon containing compound. Such selective heating may be achieved, for example, by electromagnetic radiation. The carbon fibril of this invention may be produced at any desirable pressure, and the optimum pressure will be dictated by economic considerations. Preferably, the reaction pressure is between 10,13 and 1013 kPa. More preferably, the reaction pressure is 101,3 kPa. In one exemplified embodiment, the fibril is produced by contacting for 180 min and at a pressure of 101,3 kPa, a suitable iron containing particle supported on alumina with benzene gaseous in an approximately 9 1 hydrogen benzene mixture at a temperature of 900 C, the ratio on a dry weight basis of carbon containing compound to iron containing particle being greater than 1000 1. In another exemplified embodiment the fibril is produced by contacting for from one to five minutes and at a pressure of one atmosphere, a suitable iron containing particle supported on alumina with benzene gaseous in an approximately 9 1 hydrogen benzene mixture at a temperature of 1100 C, the ratio on a dry weight basis of carbon containing compound to iron containing particle being greater than 1000 1. Fibrils made according to this invention are highly graphitic as grown. The individual graphitic carbon layers are concentrically arranged around the long axis of the fiber like the growth rings of a tree, or like a scroll of hexagonal chicken wire. There is usually a hollow core a few nanometers in diameter, which may be partially or wholly filled with less organized carbon. Each carbon layer around the core may extend as much as several hundred nanometers. The spacing between adjacent layers may be determined by high resolution electron microscopy, and should be only slightly greater than the spacing observed in single crystal graphite, i.e., 0.339 to 0.348 nm. There are no methods for direct measurement of the physical properties of such small fibrils. However, the stiffness of composites containing the fibrils are those expected from the Young s moduli which have been measured on larger, well graphitized carbons. Another aspect of this invention concerns a method for producing a substantially uniform plurality of essentially cylindrical, discrete carbon fibrils. The plurality of fibrils is substantially uniform in the sense that the diameter of each fibril is substantially equal to the diameter of each other fibril. Preferably each of the fibrils is substantially free of thermally deposited carbon. The method for producing such a plurality involves contacting for an appropriate period of time and at a suitable pressure, a catalyst comprising iron supported on alumina, with a suitable gaseous carbon containing compound as previously discussed, at a temperature between 850 C and 1200 C, the ratio on a dry weight basis of carbon containing compound to metal containing particle being at least 100 1. By this method a substantially uniform plurality of fibrils, e.g. each having a diameter substantially equal to the diameter of each other fibril, may be obtained. Another aspect of this invention concerns a composite which comprises carbon fibrils as described above, including composites serving as structural materials. Such a composite may also comprise a matrix of pyrolytic or non pyrolytic carbon or an organic polymer such as a polyamide, polyester, polyether, polyimide, polyphenylene, polysulfone, polyurethane or epoxy resin, for example. Preferred embodiments include elastomers, thermoplastics and thermosets. In another embodiment, the matrix of the composite is an inorganic polymer, e.g. a ceramic material or polymeric inorganic oxide such as glass. Preferred embodiments include fiberglass, plate glass and other molded glass, silicate ceramics, and other refractory ceramics such as aluminum oxide, silicon carbide, silicon nitride and boron nitride. In still another embodiment the matrix of the composite is a metal. Suitable metals include aluminum, magnesium, lead, copper, tungsten, titanium, niobium, hafnium, vanadium, and alloys and mixtures thereof. The carbon fibrils are also useful in various other applications. One embodiment is a method for increasing the surface area of an electrode or electrolytic capacitor plate by attaching thereto one or more carbon fibrils of this invention. In another embodiment the fibril can be used in a method for supporting a catalyst which comprises attaching a catalyst to the fibril. Such catalyst may be an electrochemical catalyst. The carbon fibrils are also useful in a method of enhancing the electrical conductivity of a material. According to this method an effective electrical conductivity enhancing amount of carbon fibrils is incorporated in the material. A further use of the carbon fibrils is in a method of enhancing the thermal conductivity of a material. In this method an effective thermal conductivity enhancing amount of carbon fibrils is incorporated in the material. An additional use of the carbon fibrils is in a method of shielding an object from electromagnetic radiation. In this method an effective shielding amount of carbon fibrils is incorporated in the object. This invention is illustrated in the examples which follow.
