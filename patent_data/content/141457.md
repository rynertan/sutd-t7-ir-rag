# A method of making a gas pressure thermometer.

## Abstract
A measuring system comprising a container for the gas, a Bourdon tube, and a capillary of no more than about 20 m which connects said container to one end of the Bourdon tube is filled with the gas to a superatmospheric pressure prevailing at the ambient temperature of at least about 5 bar. The system is hermetically sealed and the free end of the Bourdon tube 1 is connected to a temperature indicator or recorder through a transmission mechanism 2 constituted by a multi membered linkage including a lever bar 3 , a draw link 4 , and a rack bar 5 with a pinion 6 , with adjustable angles α between the central draw link and said lever, and β between said draw link and said rack bar. The combination of the Bourdon tube 1 , the transmis sion mechanism 2 and the temperature indicator 8 or recorder is housed in a cabinet. According to the invention, the method is characterized in that, for use in the measuring system, a Bourdon tube is chosen with a long overal spring excursion of at least 22 mm and an effective spring excursion of about 11 mm, and the non linear indication occurring as the Bourdon tube is uncoiled is compensated for by adjusting angles α and β. Preferably, with the effective spring excursion of the Bour don tube of about 11 mm a spring excursion of about 40 22 mm is selected, and the transmission mechanism preferably has a factor of magnification of no more than about 1 8.5.
