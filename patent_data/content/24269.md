# Heat recovering system.

## Abstract
A heat recovering system comprising at least one heat accumulator in the shape of a comparatively elongated pack of heat absorbing plates between which there are formed flow channels for the inlet and exhaust air and wherein the air flow direction through the heat absorbing pack is periodically reversed. The inlet air channels and the exhaust air channels are hermetically sealed off from each other, whereby the inlet air and exhaust air care caused to flow in different channels and the heat is transferred from one side of the partition between the channels, is stored in the partition and is finally emitted from the other side of the partition.
