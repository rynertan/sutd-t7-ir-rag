# A long life insoluble electrode and process for preparing the same.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to preparation of in soluble electrodes having few surface defects and long life. The process for the preparation of electrodes com prises coating the surface of an electroconductive, cor rosion resisting base metal with at least one member selected from the platinum group metals and applying laser beams having energy density of 1 kW cm² or higher to the coated surface at a laser energy of 10 kJ cm² or less, thereby improving said surface due to its rapid heat treatment.
