# Multifunctional additive for lubrificating oils and process for the preparation thereof.

## Abstract
Multifunctional additive for lubrificating oils consisting of a base copolymer and of monomers grafted to said base copolymer said base copolymer being the product of copolymeri zation of at least an alkyl metacrylate containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms in its alkyl group, with at least an alkyl meta crylate containing from 10 to 18 carbon atoms in its alkyl group said graft monomers comprising at least a member se lected from the class consisting of N vinylimidazoles, N vi nylpyrrolidones, vinylpyridines and N,N dialkylaminoethyl metacrylates and at least a member selected in the class of compounds definable by means of the general formula CH₃ O CH₂ C C O CH₂CH₂ The process for the production of such an additive com prises a first reaction step wherein at least one alkyl meta crylate containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms in its alkyl group is partly or fully copolymerized with at least an alkyl meta crylate containing from 10 to 18 carbon atoms in its alkyl group followed by a second reaction step, wherein said co polymerization is completed, if it is not completed in the first step, and to the polymer the above mentioned monomers are grafted.
