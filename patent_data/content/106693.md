# A PIVOT BEARING

## Abstract
A pivot bearing between first and second components 10, 11 each of which is formed from a metal material. The pivot bearing comprises a hollow annular boss 14 which is formed as an integral part of the first component 10 by being drawn from the base material from which the first component is formed. An opening 12 is provided in the second component 11 and the annular boss 14 is pivotally located within the opening. The free end portion 18 of the boss 14 is pressed over such that the cross sectional area of the free end is greater than the opening 12 thereby pivotally retaining the second component 11 on the annular boss 14 . A wear resistant plastics bushing comprising a sleeve 25 and a flange 16 can be positioned within the bearing and placed under pressure by the coupling of the compo nents to create a required level of friction within the bearing.
