# Membrane cell brine feed.

## Abstract
Method for reducing electrical energy consumption over long term use of an electrolytic cell containing an ion exchange membrane which comprises electrolyzing an alkali metal chlo ride solution in the cell which contains a concentration of less than about 70 ppm carbonate whether or not such concen tration is achieved by removing excess carbonate previously added to the solution to reduce the hardness.
