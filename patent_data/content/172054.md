# A system for the display of video images on a screen by line by line and point by point sweeping.

## Abstract
This system includes a composite memory 5 in which are memorized the data for images to be displayed for each frame. A video display processor 12 controls the screen 8 . A central processing unit 1 effects the composition of the image with the memory and an adress processor 10 , the extraction of the point data to be displayed being effected by a time base circuit BT synchronized with the sweeping of the screen, and by a control device 15 for dynamic access which distributes the access times among different units utilizing the memory. The memory 5 includes a first control memory for the memorization of a data word for a line or group of lines making up the image, each word having an address value for addressing a second control memory which contains, at each of these addrsses, at least one display attribute data word characterizing the contents of the line s corresponding to the value of the respective address of the first control memory.
