# PURIFICATION OF TEREPHTHALIC ACID

## Abstract
An improved method for producing purified terephthalic acid by catalytic hydrogenation is disclosed. Control of the reduction of colored compounds during the production of purified terephthalic acid is effected by modulating solution hydrogen concentration during hydrogenation.
