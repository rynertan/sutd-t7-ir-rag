# Extraction process.

## Abstract
Dry tea leaf is extracted with aqueous solvent, preferably by countercurrent procedures at atmospheric pressure, the spent tea leaf is separated from the extract, the spent tea leaf is acidified to a pH within the range of 2.0 to 3.0, the acidified spent tea leaf is further extracted with aqueous solvent at tem peratures of about 140 170 C for at least 4 minutes at pres sures of about 80 100 psig to provide a high temperature high pressure acid extract, and said high temperature high pressure acid extract is used as aqueous solvent in the earlier extraction procedures to provide a high extraction yield of good quality extract.
