# Extraction and intensification of anthocyanins from grape pomace and other material.

## Abstract
Anthocyanin extracts, known as enocianina, extracted from grape pomace with sulphure dioxide, are treated with enzymes, e.g. pectinase and amylase, to reduce or remove solids from the extract. The colour of the enocianina can be intensified by treatment of the clarified extract with acetal dehyde.
