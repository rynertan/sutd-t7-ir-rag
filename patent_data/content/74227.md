# Adapter permitting smaller size battery cell to function in larger size applications.

## Abstract
Adapter for permitting a smaller standard size battery to be used in applications requiring dimensionally large standard size battery cells. The adapter can be economically formed of plastic and is intended to permit an AA size cell 12 to be used in C and D cell applications and a specially arranged metallic contact 89 is provided at one end in conjunction with a stop member 84 which prevents the repeated insertions of the AA size cell 12 from crushing a resilient member 92 integrally formed with the electrical contact member 89 . The adapter can be formed in two halves and can be secured together by means of an outer label, thereby eliminating the necessity for glues and adhesives to hold the halves together.
