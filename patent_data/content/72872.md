## Description
l HYDROXYMETHYL PROSTEN l OL DERIVATIVES The present invention relates to l hydroxy lhydroxymethyl prostaglandins, as well as the pharmaceutically acceptable, non toxic C1 to C4 alkyl esters thereof, and to the intermediates and processes for producing such compounds. Prostaglandins have classically been described as chemically related 20 carbon chain hydroxy fatty acids having the basic skeleton of prostanoic acid EMI1.1 The prostaglandins having a hydroxyl group at the C ll position and a keto group at the C 9 position are known as the PGE series, and those having a hydroxyl group in place of the keto group are known as the PGF series and are further designated by an or B suffix to indicate the configuration of the hydroxyl group at said position. The natural compounds are the hydroxy substituted compounds. They may contain different degrees of unsaturation in the molecule, particularly at C 5, C 13 and C 17, the unsaturation is also indicated by a suffix.Thus, for example, the PGF1 and PGE series refer to prostanoic acids having a trans olefin bond at the C 13 position, while the PGF2 and PGE2 series refer to prostadienoic acids having a cis olefin bond at theC 5 position and a trans olefin bond at the C 13 position.For a review on prostaglandins and the definition of primary prostaglandins, see, for example, P. RannJell, The Prostaglandins, 1, pp. 5 22 1973 . The preparation of derivatives of prostanoic acid has become of great importance since the demonstration of the highly interesting range of biological and pharmacological activities of natural prostaglandins. The great majority of these studies have focused on modification of the two side chains, or modifications substitutents attached to the cyclopentenone moiety see for example U. Axen et al., Synthesis Vol. 1, John Wiley and Sons Inc., New York, N.Y. 1973 and P. H. Bently, Chem.Soc. Reviews 2, 29 1973 . The synthesis of prostaglandin analogs possessing a 3 oxa or l1 deoxy 3 thia moiety have been described, among others in U.S. Patent No. 3,873,607 U.S. Patent No.3,950,406 Netherlands Patent 7305222 Q U.S. Patent No.3,944,593 U.S. Patent No. 3,931,289 and U.S. Patent No.3,936,487. The synthesis of several prostaglandin analogs wherein the hydroxyl group at C 15 has been removed and a hydroxyl group has been introduced at C 16 has appeared see, for example, U.S. Patent No. 3,950,406 Prostaglandins, Vol. 10, 733 1975 Tetrahedron Letters, No.48, 4217 1975 . Recently reports have also appeared wherein the C 16 carbon bearing a hydroxyl group is substituted with a methyl group lsee Pappo et al., Tetrahedron Letters,No. 4, 235 1975 Collin et al., U.S. Patent No.3,965,143 and Belgium Patent No. 827,127 . Also, a patent has recently appeared wherein the C 16 carbon bearing the hydroxyl group is substituted with vinyl, methylvinyl, and cyclopropyl U.S. Patent 4,061,670 . The present invention is directed to the compounds of the formula EMI3.1 wherein n is the interger 2 5 inclusive x is CH2CH2 or CH CH cis R1 is hydrogen or hydroxy R and R are the same or different and are hydrogen, C1 to C4 alkyl, C1 to C6 alkanoyl or optionally substituted benzoyl, wherein said substituents on said benzoyl moiety are selected from the group C1 to C4 alkoxy, halo and trifluoromethyl C13 C14 is CH2CH2 or CH CH trans andR2 is selected from the group consisting of EMI5.1 wherein R is hydrogen,or methyl R is selected from the 4 5 group consisting of C c alkyl R is selected from the 47 9 group consisting of C3 C6 R1 is selected from the group 11 consisting of C3 C7 alkyl the racemic mixtures thereof and the individual optically active enantiomers thereof and the pharmaceutically acceptable non toxic salts thereof. In particular, the compounds of this invention can be prepared by a 1,4 conjugate addition procedure involving treatment of an ether blocked cyclopentenone such as 64 or 70 with a lithio cuprate reagent such as 74 , 25 , or 76 , prepared as illustrated in Flowsheets A through G which follow. The 1,4 conjugate addition procedure is described hereinbelow. The preparation of the various requisite l iodo trans l alkenyl or l tributylstannyl trans l alkenyl derivatives is illustrated in Flowsheets A C and the methods of preparation of the 4 hydroxycyclopentenones embracing the l hydroxymethyl l hydroxy chain are described in connection with Flowsheets D and E. In accordance with the procedure as outlined in Flowsheet A, an aldehyde 34 is treated with propargylic magnesium halide to form the homopropargylic alcohol 35 , which is converted to its trimethylsilyl ether in the usual manner. The silylated derivative is then treated with disiamylborane prepared in situ in tetrahydrofuran solution at ice bath temperature from 2 methyl 2 butene, sodium borohydride and boron trifluoride ethereate and then anhydrous trimethylamine oxide. The resulting solution and an iodine solution in tetrahydrofuran are added simultaneously to a sodium hydroxide solution to give the l iodo 4 trimethylsilyloxytrans l alkene 36 , precursors for 16 hydroxy prostaglandins. The trimethylsilyl protecting group is removed with mild acid and the resulting vinyl iodide alcohol is oxidized with pyridinium chlorochromate to provide the l iodo 4 oxo trans l alkene 37 , which upon treatment with a Grignard reagent R113MgX provides the l iodo 4 hydroxy trans l alkene, which is silylated in the usual manner to provide the silyl either 38 wherein R is 11 a C3 to C7 alkyl or an alkenyl group and R 13 is vinyl, methyl, or hydrogen. FLOWSHEET AEMI7.1 A preferred method for the preparation of vinyl lithium precursor is also described in Flowsheet A.Treatment of the requisite carboxylic acid 39 or 39a with the appropriate organolithium reagent R Li or 13R Li respectively , wherein R and R are herein 11 11 13 above defined, give the corresponding ketone 40 which upon treatment with propargylic magnesium halide provides the homopropargylic alcohol 41 which is converted to the trans vinylstannyl derivative by sequential treatment with chlorotrimethylsilane and tri n butyltin hydrideTreatment of the vinylstannyl reagent 42 with nbutyllithium at a temperature of lO0C to 780C generates the corresponding vinyl lithium reagent. FLOWSHEET BEMI8.1 In accordance with Flowsheet B hereinabove, the precursors for 16 hydroxy prostaglandins are prepared by treating an appropriate aldehyde or ketone 43 with a propargylic magnesium halide to yield the requisite homopropargylic alcohol 44 . The alcohol is protected as a trityl ether 45 for secondary alcohols or as a trimethylsilyl ether 45 for tertiary alcohols .These ethers are then converted to the appropriate transvinyliodide 46 by treatment with disiamylborane generated in situ from 2 methyl 2 butene, sodium borohydride, and then iodine and sodium hydroxide, wherein R 15 is hydrogen, or methyl Z is O C C6H5 3 when R 15 is hydrogen and Z is O Si CH3 3 when R 15 is methyl or ethyl R 14 is selected from the group C3 to C7 alkyl. The preparation of the precursors for the synthesis of secondary 15 hydroxy congeners and 16 hydroxy congeners are described in the literature. The preparation of the precursor for 15 methyl 15 hydroxy is described inFlowsheet C hereinbelow. See, for example, U.S. Patent No.4,235,797 which is incorporated herein by reference.In accordance with Flowsheet C, an acid chloride, wherein R5 is a C4 C7 alkyl group, is treated with acetylene and aluminum trichloride to provide the vinylchloride 55 which upon treatment with sodium iodide furnishes the vinyliodide 56 . Treatment of 56 with methylmagnesium halide followeR by chlorotrimethylsilane gives the requisite protected vinyliodide 57 . FLOWSHEET CEMI10.1 The procedures set forth above for the preparation of the various vinyl iodide and vinyl tin intermediates have been disclosed with particularity in the following U.S. PatentNo. 4,233,231 and U.S. Patent No. 4,254,145. The preparation of the cyclopentenones useful in this invention containing the l hydroxy l hydroxymethyl feature 58a and 59a where R1 is hydrogen or a hydroxy group can be accomplished in several ways.EMI11.1 The preparation of the respective hydroxyhydroxymethyl analogs and the protection of these compounds for a conjugate addition reaction is described hereinbelow in Flowsheets D and E. For the preparation of cyclopentenones of the type wherein the intermediate includes the group CH CH cis , as shown by structure 59b. An alkyl vicinal diol substituted triarylphosphonium halide is first prepared by reaction of 4 w halo C4 to C6 alkyl 2,2, dimethyl 1,3 dioxolane with triphenylphosphine in the presence of a polar inert solvent, for example, dimethyl formamide, acetonitrile, etc. sometimes admixed with acetone. See Flowsheet D . The reaction is typically conducted at elevated temperatures 600l00C for from about 24 to 178 hours.The alkyldiol substituted triphenyiphoshonium halide 60 obtained is then used in a subsequent Wittig Reaction with a 2,5 dihydro 2,5 C1 to C4 alkoxy 2 3 l oo propyls furan 61 to produce a 2,5 dihydro 2,5 di C1 to C4 alkoxy 2 , 1 dihydroxy 3 C8 to C10 alkenyl furan 62 .The reaction is carried out in demethylsulfoxide typically at 0 to 500 in the presence of the Wittig reagent, prepared by treating dimsyl sodium with compound 60 typically in the same inert solvent. Conversion of compound 62 to the required cyclopentenones 63 is effected by sequential treatment of 62 with wet silica gel and, after isolation of crude intermediate material, with aqueous mineral acid in a co solvent such as dioxane or dimethoxyethane. A preferred system is one normal sulfuric acid in aqueous dioxane at reflux temperatures for a period of 24 hours Protection of the hydroxy groups of compounds 63 suitable for the conjugate addition reaction is accomplished by treating these compounds with hexa C1 to C4 alkyl di silazane and a halo tri C1 to C4 alkylsilane such as chlorotimethylsilane.The components are admixed in a suitable polar organic solvent, i.e., pyridine for from about 1 to about 24 hours at 0 to 750 affording the compounds 64 . The preparation of cyclopentenones of the type used in the preparation of the compounds of formula 58a is accomplished by reaction of a 2 hydroxy suberic, azelic or sebacic acid 65 and acetone to yield the corresponding 4 U carboxy C5 to C7 alkyl 2,2 dimethyl 5oxo 1,3 dioxolane 66 . See Flowsheet E.The cyclization is carried out in the presence of catalytic amounts of an acid catalyst, i.e., sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, p toluenesulfonic acid and the like, typically an inert organic solvent such as acetone, petroleum ether or mixtures thereof for a time and at a temperature sufficient to complete the reaction. Preferably the reaction is conducted under reflux conditions with the simultaneous azeotropic removal of water until no additional water accumulates in the distillate. Compounds 66 are converted, through the intermediacy of their mixed anhydrides with trifluoroacetic acid followed by FridelCrafts acylation of furan, into 2 furoyl 2 hydroxy C7 to Cg alkanoic acids 67 .Typically the reaction is accomplished in a polar inert organic solvent, i.e., chloroform, methylene dichloride, etc., at 0 to SOC for 5 minutes to 40 hours. Compounds 67 are selectively reduced to compounds 68 using borane tetrahydorfuran complex at temperatures of 10 to 200 over 1 to 24 hours.Solvents of preference include the linear and cyclic ethers such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, and the like. Rearrangement of compounds 68 to the 4 hydroxy cyclopent 2 en l on 2 yl alkane 1,2 diols 69 is accomplished by 1 Treatment of 68 with a solution of weak aqueous acid in a solvent such as dioxane or dimethoxyethane at a temperature of 750 1000. A preferred system is two normal formic acid in aquous dioxane at reflux temperatures for a period of 24 hours 2 after completion of the first stage, the reaction solution is treated with a strong acid, preferably sulfuric acid in a quantity sufficient to make the solution one normal, and the resulting reaction solution is further heated to effect final conversion to 69 . A preferred set of conditions employs the above prepared solution one normal in sulfuric acid in aqueous dioxane at reflux temperatures for a period of 24 hours. FLOWSHEET DEMI15.1 FLOWSHEET EEMI16.1 wherein n 6 to 8. The hydroxy groups of compounds 69 may also be protected using the procedure described for compounds 63 , which gives rise to compounds 70 . The preparation of the compounds of formula I from the requisite intermediate cyclopentenones the preparation of such of which being disclosed above is accomplished by a conjugate addition reaction using organocopper reagents. These procedures are well known in the art and are described in, for example, C.J. Sih, et al J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 97 865 1978 . A brief description of the reaction sequence is set forth below and in the Preparations and Examples herein.EMI17.1 R21 represents an R2 group wherein the hydroxyl substituents of this moiety have been protected by the procedures shown above in Flowsheets A through C, P is a protecting group and R2 and X are as previously defined. The protecting groups P are selected from any of the protecting groups well known to those skilled in this art and include the groups tri C1 to C4 alkylsilyl, such as those obtained from the silylchlorides triphenylmethyl, such as those obtained from the trityl halides p methoxy triphenylmethyl, from p methoxytriphylmethyl halides methoxymethyl, from chloromethylether as well as those protecting groups obtained from 2 methoxypropene dihydro 2H pyran, ethylvinylithio and the like. Typically the hydroxy compounds of formulae 69 and 63 are heated with an amount of the protecting group reagent, in sufficient excess to assure complete reaction of each hydroxy moiety, i.et, 2 equivalents of protecting group reagent per equivalent of hydroxy moiety, in the absence or presence of an inert organic solvent. In accordance with Flowsheet F the vinyl iodide 71 is treated with either one equivalent of n butyllithium or 2 equivalents of t butyllithium at low temperature, preferably 300 to 700 in an inert solvent, e.g., hexane, ether or toluene to provide the trans alkenyllithium reagent 73 . Alternatively, the vinyllithium reagent 73 can be prepared by treatment of a vinylstannyl derivative such as 72 with n butyllithium at 100 to 78 in ether or THF. For the preparation of the asymmetrical lithio cuprate 74 or the like, a solution of one molar equivalent of copper I l alkyne, preferably one to five molar equivalents, and anhydrous ether is added to one molar equivalent of the aforementioned vinyllithium solution cooled to about 780C. After about one hour at this temperature, a molar equivalent of the requisite cyclopentenone 64 or 70 is added. After several hours at 780C to 200C the reaction mixture is quenched with aqueous ammonium chloride solution and the blocked product 77 is isolated in the usual manner and see Flowsheet G . It is also possible to effect conjugate 1,4addition with the asymmetrical lithio cuprate 76 derived from vinyllithium 73 and cuprous thiophenoxide.A solution of vinyllithium 73 in ether at 780C is reacted with equimolar amounts of a reagent prepared by admixture in ether at OOC to 780C of equimolar amounts of cuprous thiophenoxide and copper I iodidetributylphosphonium complex. After about 30 minutes at this temperature, the lithio cuprate 76 is treated with the requisite cyclopentenone 64 or 70 as described here inabove for the conjugate addition with l alkynyl lithio cuprate 74 . For the preparation of the symmetrical lithio cuprate 75 one molar equivalent of copper I iodidetributylphosphine complex, dissolved in anhydrous ether, is added at about 780C to two molar equivalents of the aforementioned vinyllithium 73 solution in hexane, cooled to 78 C. After about one hour at this temperature, the lithio cuprate 75 is treated with the requisite cyclopentenone 64 or jO as described hereinabove for the conjugate addition with the l alkynyl lithio cuprate 74 . Removal of the blocking groups from 77 to give the prostaglandin congeners of formula I is accomplished by treatment of 77 with a mixture of acetic acid, tetrahydrofuran and water 4 2 1 at 250C to 550C.FlowsheetG particularly illustrates these procedures where compounds 87 a and 87 b are deblocked to yield the compounds of formula I a and I b. In Flowsheet G, P represents a protecting group, and X, Rg, R11 and n are as previously defined FLOWSHEET FEMI21.1 FLOWSHEET GEMI22.1 FLOWSHEET G CONTINUEDEMI23.1 All available evidence indicates that the CH CH h function introduced by the cuprate process occupies a position trans to the 11 hydroxy function.Similarly, in the product e.g., 87 a and 87 b the two side chains attached to C8 and C12 are trans to each other. However, the configurational relationship in the product as it is obtained directly from the cuprate process may be either cis or trans, i.e., these products may have the side chains in a trans or cis relationship or they may be a mixture containing both the trans and cisisomers. This is indicated in the nomenclature of the compounds involved by the designation t. In order to ensure a trans relationship in 77 these products can be submitted to conditions known in the literature to equilibrate the cis 8 iso PGE to a mixture containing about 90 of the trans product. These conditions involve treatment with potassium acetate in aqueous methanol for 96 hours at room temperature. When the compounds of this invention are prepared from racemic starting compounds two racemates are obtained.In appropriate instances these racemates can be separated from each other by careful application of the usual chromatographic procedures. In the more difficult instances it may be necessary to apply high pressure liquid chromatography including recycling techniques. See G. Fallick, American Laboratory, 19 27 August, 1973 as well as references cited therein. Additional information concerning high speed liquid chromatography and the instruments necessary for its application is available fromWaters Associate, Inc.Maple Street, Milford, Mass.3 It is also possible to prepare the compounds of this invention in their optically active forms by the conversion of the optically active 2 , l alky1diol 4 hydroxycyclopent 2 en l ones 64 or 70 to the optically active protected analogs by procedure well known to the art.The compounds of formula I can be selectively esterified by dissolving the free hydroxy compounds in pyridine and adding one equivalent of an anhydride 5 CO 20 or the acid chloride R5COC1 and allowing the mixture to stand overnight to give the desired esters 78 and 79 . EMI25.1 wherein R15 is phenyl substituted with one or more groups such as alkyl C1 C4 , OR R C2 C4alkyl , SR R C2 C4alkyl , F, C1, dialkylamino, or C2 C4 alkyl. The 4 hydroxycyclopentenone racemates may be resolved into their component enantiomers 83 and 84 wherein n, X, R and R are as hereinabove defined by derivatizing the ketone function with a reagent having an optically active center. The resulting diastereoisomeric mixture can then be separated by fractional crystallization, or by chromatography, or by high speed liquid chromatography involving, if necessary,recycling techniques. Among the useful optically active ketone derivati zing reagents are I a aminoxy a methylpentanoic acid hydrochloride to give 85 , R 2 aminoxy 3, 3 dimethylbutyric acid hydrochloride, and 4 methylbenzyl semicarbazide. After separation of the distereomeric derivatives, reconstitution of the keto function provides the individual 4 hydroxycyclopentenone enantiomers 83 and 84 . A useful procedure for the resolution of a 4hydroxycyclopentenone racemate via an oxime is described in the art 1R. Pappo, P. Collins and C. Jung,Tetrahedron Letters, 943 1973 . The resolution of the hydroxycyclopentenone 83 wherein CE2 X CH2 is EMI26.1 is described by Bruhn et al., Tetra hedron Letters, 235 1976 .EMI27.1 Other useful ketone derivatizing agents are optically active 1,2 glycols, e.g., D 2,3 butanediol, or 1,2 dithiols, e.g., L 2,3 butanedithiol. These are used to convert the 9 oxo derivative to 9,9 alkylenedioxa or 9,9 alkylenedithia derivatives, separation of diastereomers by chromatographic procedures followed by regeneration of the individual 9 oxo diastereomer by ketal cleavage all by procedures well known in the art. Both ketalization and deketalization would have to be accomplished by procedures which would not disrupt the ll oxo9 keto system, which of course, is not a problem in the ll unsubstituted series. An alternate procedure for the preparation of the 4 R hydroxycyclopentenone enantiomers such as 83 involves as a key step the selective microbiological or chemical reduction of trione 86 to the 4 R hydroxycyclopentanedione 87 . A wide variety of microorganisms are capable of accomplishing this asymmetric reduction, one of the most useful being Dipodascus unincleatus. This step also can be achieved chemically by catalytic hydrogenation in the usual manner for example, under about one atmosphere of hydrogen in methanol using a soluble rhodium catalyst with chiral phosphine ligands, such as 1, 5 cyclooctadiene bis o anisylcyclohexylmethylphosphine rhodium I tetrafluoroborate in the presence of one equiva lent of organic base, such as triethylamine.EMI29.1 Procedures for the preparation of the requisite cyclopentanetriones are well established in the art and generally involve the treatment of an w l oxo long chain ester with methyl or ethyl oxalate and a base such as sodium methoxide in methanol, followed by treatment with hydrochloric acid in aqneous methanol. See J. Kutsube and M. Matsui, tP. Biol. Chem., 33 1078 1969 P.Collins, C.J. Jung and R. Pappo, Israel Journal of Chemistry 6, 839 1968 R. Pappo, P. Collins and C. Jung, Ann, N.Y.Acad. Sci., 180, 64 1971 C. J. Sih, et al., J.A.C.S., 95, 1676 1973 see reference 7 and J.B. Heather, et al.,Tetrahedron Letters, 2313 1973 for pertinent background literature. It is also possible to resolve the 4 hydroxycyclopentone racemate 88 by microbiological means. Thus, treatment of the 4 O alkanoyl or aroyl derivatives 89 , h 8 aryl or alkyl of racemate 88 preferably the 4 0acetyl and 4 O propionyl derivatives with an appropriate microorganism, preferably a Saccharomyces species e.g., 1375 143, affords preferential de O acylation of the 4 R enantiomer to give 190 , which is then separated from the unreacted 4 S O acyl enantiomer 191 by chromatographic procedures. After separation, mild hydrolysis yields the 4 S hydroxycyclopentenone 192 . See N. J. Marsheck and M. Miyano, Biochima et Biphysica Act, 316, 363 1973 for related examples .EMI30.1 EMI31.1 It is also possible to prepare the individual 4 hydroxycyclopentenones 190 and 192 directly by selective microbial hydroxylations of the corresponding 4 unsubstituted cyclopentenone 193 . For example, withAspergillus niger ATCC 9142 a selective 4 R hydroxylation of 148, Z CH2 6 has been reported see S.Kurozumi, T. Tora and S. Ishimoto, Tetrahedron Letters, 4959 1973 . Other microorganisms can also accomplish this hydroxylation.EMI31.2 The ring system of the novel compounds of this invention allows them to be characterized as PGE type compounds EMI31.3 The novel compounds of this invention possess the pharmacological activity described below as associated with the PGE prostaglandin type. The known PGE compounds are all potent in causing multiple biological responses even at low doses. For example, PGE1 and PGE2 are extremely potent in causing vasodepression and smooth muscle stimulation, and also are potent as antilipolytic agents. Moreover, for many applications, these known prostaglandins have an inconviently short duration of biological activity. In striking contrast, the novel prostaglandin analogs of this invention are substantially more specific with regard to potency in causing prostaglandin like biological responses, and or having a substantially, longer duration of biological activity.Therefore, each of these novel prostaglandin analogs is surprisingly and unexpectedly more useful than one of the corresponding above mentioned known prostaglandins for at least one of the pharmacological purposes indicated below for the latter, either because it has a different and narrower spectrum of biological activity than the known prostaglandins, and therefore is more specific in its activity and causes smaller and fewer undesired side effects than the known prostaglandins, or because of its prolonged activity, fewer and smaller doeses of the novel prostaglandin analog can frequently be used to attain the desired result. ll deoxy PGE type compounds are additionally selective in that they are at most relatively very weak stimulants of smooth muscle. The ll deoxy PGE compounds have a further advantage in that they are much more stable and have a longer shelf life than the corresponding 11hydroxy derivatives as described more fully hereinbelow. Another advantage of the novel compounds of this invention, compared with the known prostaglandins, is that these novel compounds are administered effectively, orally, sublingually, intravaginally, buccally, or rectally, in addition to the usual intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous injection or infusion methods indicated above for the uses of the known prostaglandins. These qualities are advantageous because they facilitate maintaining uniform levels of these compounds in the body with fewer, shorter, or smaller doeses and make possible self administration by the patient. PGE1, PGE2 and dihydro PGE1, , and their esters and pharmacologically acceptable salts, are extremely potent in causing various biological responses. For that treason, these compounds are useful for pharmacological purposes.See, for example, Bergstron, et al., Pharmacol. Rev. 20, 1 1968 , and references cited therein. A few of those biological responses are systemic arterial blood pressure lowering in the case of the PGE, compounds as measured, for example, in anesthetized phenobarbital sodium pentolinium treated rats with indwelling aortic and right heart cannulas pressor activity, similarly measured, for thePGF compounds stimulation of smooth muscle as shown, for example, by tests on strips of guinea pig ileum, rabbit duodenum, or gerbil colon potentiation of other smooth muscle stimulants antilipolytic activity as shown by antagonism of epinephrine induced mobilization of free fatty acids or inhibition of the spontaneous release of glycerol from isolated rat fat pads inhibition of gastric secretion in the case of the PGE as shown in dogs with secretion stimulated by food or histamine infusion activity on the central nervous system decrease of blood platelet adhesiveness in the case of PGE, as shown by platelet toglass adhesiveness, and inhibition of blood platelet aggregation and thrombus formation induced by various physical stimuli, e.g., arterial injury and various biochemical stimuli, e.g. ADP, ATP, serotonin, thrombin and collagen and in the case of the PGE compounds, stimulation of epidermal proliferation and keratinization as shown when applied in culture to embryonic chick and rat skin segments. Because of these biological responses, the knownPGE prostaglandins are useful to study, prevent, control, or alleviate a wide variety of disease and undesirable physiological conditions in birds and mammals, including humans, useful domestic animals, pets, and zoological specimens, and in laboratory animals, for example, mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys. For example, PGE compounds, are useful in mammals, including man, as nasal decongestants. For this purpose, the compounds are used in a dose range of about 10 g to about 10 mg per ml of a pharmacologically suitable liquid vehicle or as an aerosol spray, both for topical application. PGE compounds are also useful in mammals, including man and certain useful animals, e.g., dogs and pigs, to reduce and control excessive gastric secretion, thereby reducing or avoiding gastric erosion or gastrointestinal ulcer formation, and accelerating the healing of such ulcers already present in the gastrointestinal tract. For this purpose, the compounds are injected or infused intravenously, subcutaneously, or intramuscularly in an infusion dose range of about 0.1 g to about 500 g per kg of body weight per minute, or in a total daily dose by injection or infusion in the range of about 0.1 mg to about 20 mg per kg of body weight per day, the exact dose depending on the age, weight, and condition of the patient or animal, and on the frequency and route of administration.These compounds may also be useful in conjunction with various non steroidal anti inflammatory agents, such as aspirin, phenylbutazone, indomethacin and the like, to minimize the well known ulcerogenic effects of the latter. PGE compounds are useful whenever it is desired to inhibit platelet aggregation, to reduce the adhesive character of platelets, and to remove or prevent the formation of thrombi in mammals, including man, rabbits, sni rats. For example, these compounds are useful in treatment and prevention of myocardial infarcts, to treat and prevent post operative thrombosis. For these purposes, these compounds are administered systemically, e.g., intravenously, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, and in the form of sterile implants for prolonged action. For rapid response, especially in emergency situations, the intravenous route of administration is preferred.Doses in the range of about 0.005 mg to about 20 mg per kg of body weight per day are used, the exact dose depending on the age, weight, and condition of the patient or animal, and on the frequency and route of administration. lla Rydroxy PGE compounds are extremely potent in causing stimulation of smooth muscle, and are also highly active in potentiating other known smooth muscle stimulators, for example, oxytocic agents, e.g., oxytocin, and the various ergot alkaloids including derivatives and analogs thereof.Therefore PGE2, for example, is useful in place of or in combination with less than usual amounts of these known smooth muscle stimulators, for example to relieve the symptons of paralytic ileus, or to control or prevent uterine bleeding after abortion or delivery, to aid in expulsion of the placenta, and during the puerperium. For the latter purpose, the PGE compound is administered by intravenous infusion immediately after abortion or delivery at a dose in the range about 0.01 g to about 50 g per kg of body weight per minute until the desired effect is obtained. Subsequent doses are given by intravenous, subcutaneous, or intramuscular injection or infusion during puerperium in the range of 0.01 mg to 2 mg per kg of body weight per day, the exact dose depending on the age, weight, and condition of the patient or animal. PGE compounds are also useful as hypotensive agents to reduce blood pressure in mammals including man.For this purpose, the compounds are administered by intravenous infusion at the rate about 0.01 g to about 50 g per kg of body weight per minute, or in a single or multiple doses of about 25 g to 2500 g per kg of body weight total per day. In addition, PGE type prostaglandins compounds are useful in place of oxytocin to induce labor in pregnant female animals, including man, cows, sheep, pigs, at or near term or in pregnant animals with intrauterine death of the fetus from about 20 weeks to term. For this purpose, the compound is infused intravenously at a dose 0.01 g to 50 g per kg of body weight per minute until or near the termination of the second stage of labor, i.e., expulsion of the fetus. The compounds are especially useful when the female is one or more weeks postmature and natural labor has not started, or 12 to 60 hours after the membranes have ruptured and natural labor has not yet started. PGE compounds are also useful for controlling the reproductive cycle in ovulating female mammals, including humans and other animals. The novel PGE compounds of this invention are also useful as bronchodialtors for the treatment of asthma and chronic bronchitis. As such they may be conveniently administrered by inhalation of aerosol sprays prepared in a dose range of about 10 g to about 10 mg ml of a pharmacologically suitable liquid vehicle. Relative to the natural prostaglandins, the PGE compounds in particular have the significant advantage of inducing prolonged effects. The compounds of this invention are useful as vasodilators whose activity may be restricted to the site of application by control of the dose applied. Compositions containing the compounds of this invention may be applied topically and by local injection to increase peripheral circulation or to treat peripheral vascular disorders of the arteriospastic and occlussive types. Compositions for topical administration containing prostaglandins similar to those of this invention are disclosed by applicationSerial No. 934,199 filed August 16, 1978, now U.S. PatentNo. 4,254,145. The compounds of this invention may be employed as vasodilators for topical application in the compositions and dosages described by the above cited applications.Typically topical preparations contain from about .3 to 20 by W W of the compounds of this invention in a pharmaceutical carrier, and preferably from about 1 to 5 by W W of the prostaglandin. The compounds of this invention may also be administered topically or by local injection to lower the systemic blood pressure of man and warm blooded animals.Systemic action is obtained by the use of an effective dosage greater than that used to induce localized action at the site of application. The effective dosage of the compounds of this invention administered topically in a pharmaceutical carrier for systemic effect is about .1 mg.to 10 mg. per kq. of body weiqht per day. Pharmaceutical carriers and compositions which may be employed are disclosed by application Serial No. 934,199, filed August 16, 1978 U.S. Patent No. 4,254,145.
