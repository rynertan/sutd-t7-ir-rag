A rubber reinforced, mass polymerized styrenic polymer resin comprising a a polymer matrix derived from one or more monovinylidene aromatic compounds and, optionally, one or more other ethylenically unsaturated monomers and b a rubber dispersed as discrete particles therethrough, characterized in that the polymeric matrix comprises, in polymerized form, from 0.1 to 15 weight percent of an ester of acrylic acid.

## Description
The present invention relates to rubber reinforced monovinylidene aromatic polymer resins prepared by a mass polymerization process and modified with certain acrylic acid ester monomers. Rubber reinforced thermoplastic materials derived from mass polymerization, in the presence of the rubber, of a monovinylidene aromatic compound such as styrene or a derivative of styrene and, optionally, one or more other comonomers such as acrylonitrile, are employed in a wide variety of commercial applications such as packaging, refrigerator linings, furniture, domestic appliances and toys. These thermoplastic materials are often referred to as styrenic polymer resins . The toughness, flow and gloss properties of these styrenic polymer resins are important and need to be optimized for a particular end use application. For example, it is desirable that the styrenic polymer resins styrene molding polymers used in injection molding applications flow relatively easily, at the pressures employed, to completely fill a mold which can sometimes be of a complex or intricate shape. It is also desired that the resultant article have good toughness as well as a uniform and fairly high level of gloss. In general, unmodified rubber reinforced styrenic polymer resins do not possess the desired flow characteristics for use in injection molding and other end use applications while the gloss properties of articles molded from such resins tend to be quite sensitive to molding conditions. To improve the flow properties of the styrenic polymer resin, it has become a common practice to add a flow promoter or plasticizer such as mineral oil to the resin. The plasticizer or flow promoter can be added before, during or after the preparation of the styrenic polymer resin. Unfortunately, the effect of mineral oil or other similar plasticizer on the flow characteristics of the styrenic polymer resins is limited and can be accompanied by undesirable side effects. The presence of mineral oil or other plasticizer can often lead to a phenomenon known as mold sweating . Specifically, the mineral oil or plasticizer diffuses to the interface between the styrenic polymer resin and the surface of the mold which often results in a non uniform surface of the molded article. It is also known that the flow properties of a styrenic polymer resin can be improved by preparing the styrenic polymer at a broader molecular weight distribution or by decreasing the molecular weight of the styrenic polymer. Unfortunately, as the molecular weight of the styrenic polymer becomes broader, the styrenic polymer resin often exhibits a lower strength. Moreover, methods for preparing a styrenic polymer at a broad molecular weight distribution are generally inefficient, i.e., the rate of conversion from monomer to polymer is generally lower. Alternatively, when the styrenic polymer is prepared at lower molecular weights, the resulting styrenic polymer resin is generally more brittle and less flexible, with a coincident decrease in strength. Mass polymerized rubber modified styrenic resins, due to the generally large size of the rubber particles, are also known to be generally more difficult to mold into articles having uniform good gloss. While the molding conditions can be adapted to obtain optimized gloss for a resin, it is difficult to maintain exactly constant mold conditions over a period of time and especially in large and or complex mold designs. On the other hand, emulsion polymerization processes are well known for the preparation of rubber reinforced styrenic polymers having good gloss properties. Such resins, due to their small, dense rubber particles are known to be suitable for producing molded articles wherein the gloss level is uniformly high and relatively independent of the molding conditions or mold size and shape. Such resins are found, however, for given levels of rubber reinforcement, to have poor toughness i.e., impact resistance as compared to mass polymerization products. In USP 4 308 355, it is taught that toughness of emulsion polymerized ABS type resin is improved by the use of 1 to 15 weight percent of acrylic acid ester e.g., butyl acrylate in the rubber grafting step. The toughness of these emulsion resins is still found to be inadequate for many applications, especially when compared to mass polymerized resins. In view of the stated deficiencies in the toughness, gloss and flow characteristics of the prior art rubber reinforced styrenic polymer resins, it remains highly desirable to provide such a styrenic polymer resin having improved property combinations and a method for preparing such a styrenic polymer resin. Accordingly, in one aspect, the present invention is a rubber reinforced, mass polymerized styrenic resin comprising a a polymer matrix derived from one or more monovinylidene aromatic compounds and, optionally, one or more other ethylenically unsaturated monomers and b a rubber dispersed as discrete particles therethrough, characterized in that the polymeric matrix comprises, in polymerized form, from 0.1 to 15 weight percent of an ester of acrylic acid. In another aspect, the present invention is a method for mass polymerization of a rubber reinforced styrenic polymer resin which comprises polymerizing in the presence of a rubber a monovinylidene aromatic compound and, optionally, other ethylenically unsaturated monomers characterized in that from 0.1 to 15 weight percent, based on the total weight of the monomers, of an ester of acrylic acid is copolymerized with the monovinylidene aromatic compound and other ethylenically unsaturated monomers, if any. Surprisingly, when a small amount, i.e., less than 15 weight percent, of an ester of acrylic acid is copolymerized with the monovinylidene aromatic compound and any other optionally employed comonomers to prepare the polymer matrix of a styrenic polymer resin, the resulting styrenic polymer resin exhibits improved flow characteristics. This is especially surprising since the esters of methacrylic acid, particularly those esters of methacrylic acid with an alcohol having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms, have not been found to significantly improve the flow characteristics of the styrenic polymer resin. This improvement in flow properties means that less time is required to fill molds with the molten polymer in injection molding process. In addition, due to the fact that the acrylic ester is present in copolymerized form in the styrenic polymer i.e., is copolymerized with the monovinylidene aromatic compound and other comonomers , the problems of mold sweating which are associated with using relatively large concentrations of an unbound plasticizer such as mineral oil are reduced and or eliminated. The resins according to the present invention thereby provide a real productivity advantage in terms of the reduced time required for mold cleaning. It is equally as surprising and unexpected that the use of such acrylic acid ester comonomer is additionally found to reduce the sensitivity of the gloss properties obtained in molded articles to variations in molding conditions. This is very important in the injection molding of complex and or large parts where the molten resin may be exposed to varying mold conditions in a single mold while flowing from the injection port to fill the entire mold. The ultimate result of the improved resin according to the invention is that tough, glossy articles can now be produced in standard injection molding processes with reduced cycle times and mold maintenance. The method of the present invention is used to obtain good gloss and flow characteristics of rubber reinforced styrenic polymer resins such as high impact polystyrene often referred to as HIPS or the so called ABS type resins, including transparent rubber reinforced polymer products such as described in U.S. Patent No. 4 097 555. The styrenic polymer resins of the present invention are useful in essentially any application in which the unmodified styrenic polymer resin can be employed. Due to their exceptional flow properties, the styrenic polymer resins of the present invention are particularly useful as styrene molding polymers in injection molding applications such as employed in the preparation of toys, appliances and electrical equipment and in the extrusion thermoformable applications. The styrenic polymer matrix resins of the present invention are derived from a monovinylidene aromatic compound and an ester of acrylic acid. Representative monovinylidene aromatic compounds which can be employed herein include styrene, alkyl substituted styrenes e.g., alpha methylstyrene and alpha ethylstyrene and ring substituted styrenes e.g., vinyl toluene, particularly para vinyltoluene, ortho ethylstyrene and 2,4 dimethylstyrene ring substituted halogenated styrene such as chlorostyrene and 2,4 dichlorostyrene styrenes substituted with both a halo and an alkyl group such as 2 chloro 4 methylstyrene and vinylanthracene. In general, the preferred monovinylidene aromatic compound s employed in preparing the styrenic polymer resin is styrene or a combination of styrene and alpha methylstyrene in which combination the alpha methylstyrene comprises advantageously from 10 to 50, more advantageously from 15 to 40, weight percent of the total weight of the styrene and alpha methylstyrene . Styrene is the most preferred monovinylidene aromatic compound. The esters of acrylic acid suitably employed in the practice of the present invention are those esters which are capable of forming, when homopolymerized, a polymer having a low glass transition temperature T In preparing the styrenic polymer resin of the present invention, the acrylic acid ester is employed in an amount from 0.1 to 15 weight percent, said weight percents being based on the total weight of the matrix styrenic polymer. When lower levels are employed the above mentioned flow and gloss property improvements are not observed while higher levels will tend to lower resin heat softening points and cause the resins to have unacceptably long cycle times in typical molding operations. Within said compositional limitation, the amount of the acrylic acid ester most advantageously employed is dependent on the specific monomeric components employed and their concentrations as well as whether the styrenic polymer resin is reinforced by other reinforcing agent, e.g., glass fibers. In general, the styrenic polymer comprises, in polymerized form, from 0.2 to 12, more preferably from 0.5 to 10, weight percent of acrylic acid ester, most preferably 1 to 7 weight percent, said weight percents being based on the total weight of the matrix styrenic polymer. In addition to the monovinylidene aromatic compound and acrylic acid ester, one or more other comonomers can be employed to form the styrenic polymer. Representative of such other comonomers include the unsaturated nitriles such as acrylonitrile, ethacrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile and mixtures thereof the alpha,beta ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids such as acrylic and methacrylic acid the esters of methacrylic acid such as ethyl methacrylate or methyl methacrylate and the vinyl esters such as vinyl acetate. Of the various styrenic polymer resins comprising additional comonomers, polymer resins of particular interest in the practice of the present invention are ABS type polymer resins comprising, as a matrix, a copolymer of at least one monovinylidene aromatic compound and at least one unsaturated nitrile modified by the acrylic acid ester. Preferred of the unsaturated nitriles is acrylonitrile. In preparing the styrenic polymer, the amount of the unsaturated nitrile s most advantageously employed will vary depending on the physical and chemical properties desired in the final styrenic polymer resin. In general, the styrenic polymer will advantageously be derived from 5 to 35, preferably from 15 to 25, weight percent of the unsaturated nitrile s wherein said weight percent is based on the total weight of the matrix styrenic polymer. Rubbers useful in preparing rubber reinforced styrenic polymer resins are well known in the art and reference is made thereto for the purposes of this invention. Advantageously, the rubber employed in preparing the rubber reinforced polymer resin is a homopolymer or copolymer of an alkadiene which exhibits a second order transition temperature not higher than 0 C and preferably not higher than about 20 C as determined by conventional methods, e.g., ASTM Test Method D 746 52 T. Copolymers of ethylene, propylene and, optionally, a non conjugated diene e.g., EPDM rubbers can also be employed. Preferably, the rubber is a homopolymer of a 1,3 conjugated diene such as butadiene, isoprene, piperylene, chloroprene or a copolymer of the conjugated diene with a comonomer such as a monovinylidene aromatic compound, e.g., styrene which is commonly chemically bonded randomly, in blocks or as grafted branches to the alkadiene polymer an alpha,beta ethylenically unsaturated nitrile such as acrylonitrile or an alpha,beta olefin such as ethylene or propylene. The rubber may also contain a small amount of a cross linking agent such as divinylbenzene, but excessive cross linking can result in the loss of the rubber characteristics of the rubber. Preferred rubbers are homopolymers of 1,3 butadiene and block or random copolymers of at least 50, more preferably from 55 to 85, weight percent of 1,3 butadiene and up to 50, more preferably from 15 to 45, weight percent of a monovinylidene aromatic compound, preferably styrene. In general, the rubber is employed in an amount such that the resultant rubber reinforced resin contains from 3 to 20 weight percent rubber. Rubber reinforced polymers of particular interest herein include the transparent, rubber reinforced styrenic resins modified by including the acrylic acid ester in the polymer matrix phase. In general, the modified, transparent, rubber reinforced styrenic polymer resins comprise a polymer matrix phase of at least one monovinylidene aromatic compound, an ester of methacrylic acid, preferably methyl methacrylate and, optionally, an unsaturated nitrile, modified with the acrylic acid ester. In preparing the modified, transparent, rubber reinforced styrenic polymer resin, the methacrylate comonomer and the acrylic acid ester are employed in amounts sufficient to render the rubber reinforced product transparent. Although such amounts will vary depending on the specific monomers and rubber employed in preparing the rubber reinforced styrenic polymer resin, in general, the modified, transparent HIPS type resins are derived from 25 to 65 weight percent of the monovinylidene aromatic compound, from 25 to 75 weight percent of the methacrylate, preferably methyl methacrylate and from 0.1 to 15 weight percent of the acrylic acid ester. Alternatively, in the preparation of a modified, transparent ABS type resin , the methacrylate and the acrylic acid ester are advantageously employed in an amount such that their combination totals from 15 to 70 weight percent of the styrenic matrix polymer, with the acrylic acid ester being employed in an amount such that it comprises from 0.1 to 15 weight percent of the styrenic matrix polymer. In general, the modified, transparent ABS type resin will preferably comprise from 25 to 35 weight percent of the methacrylate and from 0.2 to 10 weight percent of the acrylic acid ester. These resins typically comprise 20 to 55 weight percent of a monovinylidene aromatic compound and 5 to 35 weight percent of an unsaturated nitrile. In the practice of the present invention, the styrenic polymer resin having the improved flow characteristics is prepared by copolymerizing the monovinylidene aromatic compound s with the ester of the acrylic acid and any optionally employed other comonomers. In general, the mass type polymerization techniques and conditions which can be employed in preparing rubber reinforced styrenic polymer resins such as HIPS and ABS type resins are advantageously employed in preparing the styrenic polymer resins of the present invention. For example, in preparing ABS and HIPS type resins, mass or a combination of mass suspension polymerization techniques are most commonly employed and are also suitably employed in the practice of the present invention wherein the acrylic acid ester in copolymerized with the monomers conventionally employed in preparing said resins. Illustrative mass polymerization techniques are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3 243 841, 3 488 744 and 3 903 202, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Using mass polymerization techniques, the styrenic polymer resin is preferably prepared in one or more substantially linear stratified flow or so called plug flow type reactors, which may or may not comprise recirculation of a portion of the partially polymerized product in a stirred tank reactor wherein the contents of the reactor are essentially uniform throughout, or a combination of the two. Depending of the specific monomeric components employed and the amount of rubber present in the polymerization reaction mixture, an organic liquid reaction diluent such as aromatic hydrocarbon or inertly substituted aromatic hydrocarbon e.g., ethylbenzene, benzene or toluene and a free radical initiator such as a peroxide initiator e.g., azobisisobutyronitrile, 1,1 bis In general, the organic liquid reaction diluent is employed to control the viscosity of the polymerization mixture as well as to provide sufficient heat transfer thereof. If employed, it will generally comprise from 2 to 20 weight percent based on the total weight of the polymerization mixture i.e., the copolymerizable monomers, rubber, and the organic liquid reaction diluent . The initiator can be employed to vary the product properties of the polymer as well as to modify the rate of polymerization. In addition, the free radical initiator can be employed to initiate grafting of rubber in the polymerization mixture with polymerizing and polymerized monomers. In general, if employed, the initiator is used in an amount from 50 to 5000, preferably from 100 to 2000, weight parts per million weight parts of the monomer employed. The mass polymerization mixture can further contain other additives such as an antioxidant e.g., an alkylated phenol such as di Temperatures at which polymerization can be conducted are dependent on the specific components employed but will generally vary from 75 to 225 C, preferably 90 to 190 . In the preparation of the styrenic polymer resin using the described mass polymerization techniques, the polymerization is continued to the desired degree of completion and the resulting product is then treated to remove any unreacted monomer such as by flashing of the monomer and other volatiles at an elevated temperature under vacuum. When employing mass polymerization techniques for preparing a rubber reinforced styrenic polymer resin, the rubber is generally first dissolved in polymerizable monomer e.g., styrene and the acrylic acid ester and this monomer rubber solution is added to the mass polymerization mixture. In mass polymerization processes using a plug flow type reactor, upon addition of the monomer rubber solution to the polymerization system, the monomers are polymerized and, upon initial formation of polymer, the initially prepared polymer comes out of solution and forms a discontinuous phase comprising polymer dissolved in monomer dispersed throughout a continuous phase of the solution of rubber and monomer. Eventually, sufficient amounts of the monomer are polymerized and the discontinuous phase becomes the continuous phase with the rubber forming a discontinuous phase dispersed throughout a continuous phase of the copolymer. This phenomenom is referred to as phase inversion which term means generally the conversion of the polymer from a discontinuous phase dispersed in a continuous phase of the rubber through a point where there is no distinct continuous or discontinous phase in the polymerization mixture to a continuous polymer phase having a rubber dispersed therethrough. Alternatively, when a stirred tank reactor is employed in a mass type polymerization process, phase inversion can occur essentially immediately upon the addition of the monomer rubber solution to the polymerization mixture. It is important in the mass polymerization process and product according to the present invention, in obtaining good toughness to achieve rubber particle sizes generally larger than 0.1, preferably larger than 0.5 micrometer, more preferably larger than 0.7 micrometer and most preferably at least 1.0 micrometer. This is done in mass polymerization processes by techniques known to those skilled in the art including amount and type of agitation, the selection of the rubber type, polymerization conditions, and additives such as mercaptans or peroxides which affect the amount of polymer grafted to the rubber during the particle sizing phase. Although the modified ABS and HIPS type resins according to the invention are prepared using the described mass polymerization techniques, ABS type resins often having relatively high rubber concentrations are also conventionally prepared using emulsion polymerization techniques. Illustrative of the so called emulsion polymerization techniques for the preparation of a rubber reinforced resin are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3 509 238, 3 751 526, and 4 308 555 which are hereby incorporated by reference. It is possible, and sometimes desirable to blend materials prepared according to the invention with amounts of such emulsion polymerized resins. The following experiments are set forth to illustrate the advantages of the present invention and should not be construed to limit its scope. In the experiments, all parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise indicated. In the experiments, melt flow rate was determined using test methods designated ASTM D 1238 and the Vicat heat distortion temperature, which is an indication of the heat softening point of the polymer, was measured using the test methods described by ASTM D 1525 65T, Rate B. The tensile properties were measured using test method designated ASTM T 638 on samples which were compression molded at a melt temperature of 180 C. The tensile yield is expressed in Newtons per square millimeter N mm² and the elongation is the elongation at break expressed as a percentage of the original length. The impact strength is the notched Izod impact strength expressed in Joules meter J m measured using the test method described by ASTM D 256. The test specimens for measuring the impact strength were prepared by compression molding at a mold temperature of 180 C for 15 minutes. The molecular weight of the styrenic polymer was measured using gel permeation chromatography and the test method designated ASTM D 363, without correction between the copolymer and polystyrene standards and the solution viscosity was measured using the test method designated ASTM D 445. To a reactor vessel having a temperature control means and an agitator means were added 1500 parts of a solution comprising 6 percent of a low cis polybutadiene rubber sold as Buna Hx 529c by the Bayer, 8.5 percent ethylbenzene, 4.3 percent mineral oil, 77.5 percent styrene and 5 percent n butylacrylate. The reaction mixture was exposed to a constant agitation at a rate of 100 rpm. At the end of 2.1 hours, the reactor contained 30 percent solids and phase inversion had been completed. At this time the agitator speed to which the polymerization mixture was exposed was reduced to 60 rpm. Polymerization was contained for an additional 2.1 hours at which time the agitator speed was reduced to 30 rpm. and polymerization was continued for an additional 2.1 hours. The temperature of the reaction mixture during polymerization was initially 110 C and was continuously increased during the polymerization to a final temperature of 180 C. Following polymerization, the reaction mixture was emptied from the reactor vessel and placed in a vacuum oven where the residual monomer, ethylbenzene and other volatiles were removed from the polymerization mixture and the rubber was cross linked. The volume average particle size of the rubber and the resulting product was found to be 2.6 micrometer when determined using a commercially available particle size analyzer supplemented as necessary by transmission electron microscopy. The polymer composition of the rubber reinforced styrenic polymer resin consisted of 4.3 percent mineral oil, 8.5 percent rubber dispersed as discrete rubber particles throughout a copolymeric matrix 87.2 percent consisting of, in polymerized form, 93.6 percent styrene and 6.4 percent n butylacrylate. A styrenic polymer resin was prepared in an identical manner to that of Experiment 1 except that the polymerization mixture consisted of 72.5 percent styrene, 10 percent n butylacrylate, 6 percent rubber, 3 percent mineral oil and 8.5 percent ethylbenzene. The resulting rubber reinforced styrenic polymer resin comprised 3.5 percent mineral oil, 9.2 percent rubber dispersed at a volume average particle size of 3.0 micrometer throughout a coploymer matrix 87.3 percent consisting of, in polymerized form, 87.5 percent styrene and 12.5 percent n butylacrylate. A rubber reinforced polystyrene was prepared using the techniques identical to those of Experiment 1 except that the polymerization mixture comprised 82.5 percent styrene, 6 percent rubber and 3 percent mineral oil no n butylacrylate was employed . The resulting rubber reinforced polystyrene comprised 8.7 percent of a rubber dispersed at a volume average particle size of 2.4 micrometers throughout a matrix polymer phase consisting of polystyrene. The rubber reinforced polystyrenic resin further comprised 4.1 percent mineral oil. The melt flow rates, Vicat softening temperatures, Izod impact strengths, tensile properties and molecular weights of the above mentioned resulting rubber reinforced styrenic polymer resins were measured and are set forth in accompanying Table I. As evidenced by the data set forth in Table I, the inclusion of n butylacrylate in preparing the polymer phase of the rubber reinforced styrenic polymer resin improves the flow characteristics of the resulting polymer. Moreover, although the Izod impact strengths and tensile yield are reduced when the n butylacrylate is employed, the rubber reinforced styrenic resins prepared using the n butylacrylate still possess a sufficiently high Izod impact strength and tensile yield for most applications. In addition, the tensile yields and impact strengths can be optimized with slight modifications in the amount and or size of the resulting disperse particles. Using the techniques of Experiment 1, a transparent rubber reinforced polystyrene product was prepared by feeding to the reactor 1500 parts of a solution comprising 42.5 percent styrene, 32.2 percent methylmethacrylate, 8.3 percent sec butylacrylate, 6.7 percent rubber of block copolymer comprising 70 percent polymerized butadiene and 30 percent polymerized styrene, 10 percent ethylbenzene, 0.02 percent of a free radical initiator, 0.08 percent of a chain transfer agent and 0.2 percent of an antioxidant. This polymerization was exposed to constant agitation at a rate of 100 rpm. At the end of 1.5 hours, the reactor contained 32 percent solids and phase inversion and particle sizing of the rubber had been completed. The agitation rate to which the polymerization mixture was exposed was then reduced and polymerization completed over a 3.5 hours at a reduced agitation rate. The temperature of the reaction mixture during polymerization was initially 110 C and was increased during polymerization to a final temperature of 160 C. The resulting rubber reinforced copolymer comprised a copolymer matrix consisting, in polymerized form, of 52.6 percent styrene, 38.9 percent methylmethacrylate and 8.5 percent sec butylacrylate. Dispersed throughout the continuous copolymer matrix phase was 11 percent, based on the total weight of the copolymer resin, of disperse rubber particles having a particle size of 3.5 micrometer. The melt flow rate of the resulting high impact styrenic copolymer resin was 1.8 g 10 min. The Vicat softening temperature was 95 C. The Izod impact strength was 95J m, the tensile yield was 32.4 N mm² and elongation at break was 35 percent. Using similar techniques, a transparent high impact polystyrene product was prepared having a copolymer matrix phase consisting, in polymerized form, of 50.8 percent styrene, 39.3 percent methyl methacrylate and 9.9 percent n butylacrylate. The rubber reinforced product comprised 10 percent, based on the total weight of the rubber reinforced resin, of the rubber which was dispersed throughout the copolymer matrix phase at a particle size of 1.8 micrometer. The melt flow rate of this product was 3.9 g min and the Vicat softening temperature was 85 C. The impact strength of the rubber reinforced styrenic copolymer product was 96 J m, the tensile yield was measured to be 32.1 N mm² and the elongation at break was measured to 28 percent. Using the techniques of Experiment 3, a transparent high impact styrenic polymer was prepared which comprised 89.5 percent of a copolymer matrix having 10.5 percent of the block copolymer rubber dispersed therethrough at a volume average particle size of 0.5 micrometer. The copolymer matrix phase consisted, in polymerized form, of 45 percent styrene and 55 percent methylmethacrylate. The melt flow rate of this product was less than 0.5 g 10 min and the Vicat is 106 C. The Izod impact strength was 85 J m and the tensile yield was 33.1 N mm². The elongation at break was only 1 percent. Using the techniques of Experiment 3, a transparent rubber reinforced copolymer of styrene, methyl methacrylate, n butylacrylate and acrylonitrile was prepared. Specifically, the polymerization mixture consisted of 26.2 percent styrene, 21.1 percent methyl methacrylate, 6.5 percent n butylacrylate, 18.9 percent acrylonitrile, 7 percent of a block copolymer identical to that employed in Experiment 3, 20 percent of ethylbenzene, 0.03 percent of a free radical initiator, 0.07 percent of a chain transfer agent and 0.2 percent of an antioxidant. Polymerization temperatures were maintained between 100 C to 155 C. Polymerization was continued until 75 percent of the original monomer fed to the polymerization system had been polymerized. The resulting product comprised 11.8 percent rubber which was dispersed throughout the copolymer matrix phase at a particle size of 1 micrometer. The copolymer matrix phase consisted, in polymerized form, of 45.7 percent styrene, 28 percent methyl methacrylate, 5.9 percent n butylacrylate and 20.4 percent acrylonitrile. The melt flow rate of the resulting transparent ABS type resin was 2.3 g 10 min. The Vicat softening temperature of the copolymer product was 96 C. Using identical techniques, a transparent ABS type resin was prepared comprising 10 percent of the block copolymer rubber dispersed throughout the continuous copolymer matrix phase at a particle size of 2.5 micrometer. The copolymer matrix phase, consisted, in polymerized form, of 48 percent styrene, 29 percent methylmethacrylate, 8 percent n butylacrylate and 15 percent acrylonitrile. The melt flow rate of the resulting transparent ABS type copolymer resin was 5.3 g 10 min and the Vicat softening temperature was 90.4 C. Using the techniques of Experiment 4, a transparent ABS type copolymer resin product was prepared consisting of 9.6 percent of the block copolymer rubber dispersed at a volume average particle size of 0.3 micrometer. The copolymer matrix phase consisted, in polymerized form, of 44.8 percent styrene, 32.5 percent methylmethacrylate and 22.7 percent acrylonitrile. The melt flow rate of this product was only 0.6 g 10 min and the Vicat softening temperature was 101 C. Using the techniques of Experiment 4, a transparent ABS type copolymer resin was prepared which comprised 90.3 percent of a copolymer matrix and 9.7 percent of rubber dispersed as discrete particles having a volume average particle size of 0.4 micron throughout the copolymer matrix. The copolymer matrix consisted, in polymerized form, of 46.7 percent styrene, 34.7 percent methylmethacrylate, and 18.6 percent acrylonitrile. The melt flow rate of the transparent ABS type resin which contained no butylacrylate was 0.46 g 10 min. The Vicat softening temperature of this product was 103 C. As evidenced by the copolymer products of Experiments 4 and 5 and Comparative Experiments C and D, the transparent ABS type resins having a continuous copolymer matrix phase containing, in polymerized form, the lower alkyl acrylate, exhibited unexpectedly superior flow properties as compared to an equivalent transparent ABS type resin having a copolymer matrix phase which contained no lower alkyl acrylate. Using the techniques of Experiment 4, an ABS type resin was prepared. Specifically, the polymerization mixture consisted of 55.4 percent styrene, 3.0 percent n butylacrylate, 15.5 percent acrylonitrile, 7.4 percent of a polybutadiene rubber identical to that employed in Experiment 1, and 18.7 percent of ethylbenzene, and also contained 0.015 weight parts of a free radical initiator, and 0.3 weight parts of an antioxidant. Polymerization temperatures were maintained between 100 C to 155 C. 1000 ppm of a chain transfer agent was added during polymerization. Polymerization was continued until 74 percent of the original monomer fed to the polymerization system had been polymerized. The resulting product comprised 12 percent rubber which was dispersed throughout the copolymer matrix phase at a particle size of 0.7 micrometer. The copolymer matrix phase consisted, in polymerized form, of 73.9 percent styrene, 3.4 percent n butylacrylate and 22.7 percent acrylonitrile. The melt flow rate of the resulting ABS type resin was 3.2 g 10 min. The 60 Gardner gloss and flow properties were found to be generally better than that of a commercially available mass polymerized ABS resin having similar chemical composition and rubber particle size i.e., the other physical properties are generally equivalent but not containing any acrylic acid ester.
