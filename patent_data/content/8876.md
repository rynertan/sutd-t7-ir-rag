# Brake applying device.

## Abstract
A brake applying device for an internal shoe drum brake and comprising a hydraulic wheel cylinder 11 having pis tons 12, 13 operated to apply the brakes by one or both of hydraulic pressure or a wedge assembly 14 that move transversely of the wheel cylinder 11 . The wedge assembly has a wedge 16 and rollers 21 which act between the wedge 16 and the pistons 12, 13 to facilitate movement of the wedge. The rollers 21 are housed in a cage 22 that can move relative to the wedge 16 , the unloaded datum posi tion of the cage 22 on the wedge is determined by two opposed springs 27 and 29 that act on the cage. In order to prevent the cage 22 from becoming damaged during exceptional service conditions it has been arranged for the cage 22 to move relative to the wedge 16 during the initial application of the brakes. This is achieved by providing an abutment 38 which is encountered by the cage 22 during retraction of the wedge 16 so as to compress one of said springs 27 .
