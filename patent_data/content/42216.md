# Fuel reactor.

## Abstract
A fuel reactor having an outer frusto conical shell which is closed at one axial end and a fuel inlet at this axial end projects fuel axially into the outer shell and into an inner shell mounted coaxially therewith, the inner and outer shells being connected together at the discharge end of the inner shell, with the inner shell being open at its other end and axially spaced from the closed end of the outer shell. A tangential combus tion air inlet is connected to the annular space between the two shells while a discharge nozzle is mounted on the discharge end of the inner shell. A number of cir cumferentialiy spaced tangential slots in the inner shell adjacent the nozzle scoop up some of the swirling air projected in through the tangential air inlet and direct some of the air onto the outer surface of the discharge nozzle so that it is cooled.
