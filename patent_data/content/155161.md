## Description
This invention relates to an arrangement or apparatus for use in the treatment of surfaces. Throughout the specification and claims, the term surface treatment is used. This term is used to refer to the treatment of any appropriate surface such as for example by coating , abrading, cutting, brushing, polishing, buffing and the like. These are by way of example only however. Such treatment can be applied to any and all appropriate surfaces as for example wood, synthetic and natural resins, resin bonded materials, cement, ferro cement, earthenware, wallboards, chipboard, plaster board, fibreboard, metal and the like. Again these are by way of example only. The invention has application to all surfaces. Up until this time, various arrangements and means have been provided for the treatment of surfaces and for the preparation of surfaces for varying purposes. For example, arrangements and implements have been provided for sanding down wooden surfaces, to provide a smooth surface, prior to painting or varnishing. Arrangements and implements have also been provided which smooth down roughened surfaces, in order to avoid rough and unpleasant surfaces which can be displeasing from an aesthetic point of view and capable of causing injury or damage. The methods and arrangements for surface treatment, used up until this time, have often involved the use of implements or machines, employing a basically rotary, orbital or continuous belt action. Certain arrangements have included those assemblies as described in patent specification CH A 415336, U.S. A 1761059 and U.S A 1818361. It is known from the prior art to provide at least two elongate operating members so mounted as to be capable of longitudinal movement relative to one another an drive means for imparting a longitudinal reciprocating movement to each of the operating members. Referring in particular to situations where it has been desired to prepare and finish round or curved surfaces, such as for example during the construction of marine craft , initial preparation is usually carried out by such known methods and apparatus, with finishing usually being carried out by hand. The finishing is often carried out by one or more operators, using sandpaper mounted on or held onto a pad or connected to a flexible hand operated base board. While known methods and arrangements of machine sanding or surface treatment have been reasonably satisfactory for many purposes, there have also been a number of disadvantages. One disadvantage is the requirement for finishing curved surfaces by hand. This is nearly always necessary, and generally involves substantial time and effort from a labour point of view. It has been found to be a particular problem when sanding the hulls or marine craft, and particularly small boat hulls where it is very important that a fair line be achieved from bow to stern from top side to keel and on the diagonals. Indeed it is important that a fair line be obtained in all directions, so that not only is the hull of the boat aesthetically pleasing, but so that water flow is aided and effectively permitted around the hull of a marine craft. As will be appreciated, this minimises water resistance and therefore provides for maximum hull performance. Up until this time the general practice when finishing boat hulls has been to remove most of the severe surface irregularities such as high spots by the use of known methods and machines such as rotary, orbital and continuous belt action arrangements. A fair line has then been obtained by using flexible hand held and hand operated sanding boards. These flexible boards usually have a handle at each end, and are manually forced to comply with the curvature of the hull being sanded while being forced backward and forward by one or two operators while being traversed along the length of the hull from topsides to keel and on the eventually an acceptably fair line is achieved. It will be appreciated however, that such hand operation is hard work, tedious and particularly time consuming work. In some cases, and depending of course upon the size of the marine craft concerned it may require months of hand fairing or hand sanding, to obtain an acceptable and satisfactory fair line and standards finish. This is particularly so where it is necessary to finish a high class or high performance, hand constructed marine craft. Reference is made by way of example only, to the problems encountered in the preparation of marine craft and boats. However, it should be appreciated that similar problems arise in other areas, such as for example building construction areas, and in the area relating to the preparation of moulds and plugs, such as for use in the production of boat hulls, swimming pools, saunas and the like . In addition, the shortcomings also exist in the automotive panelbeating business, where for example soft plastics or soft metal fillers are used to fill dents and damaged portions of panelwork. Following this filling, the surfaces must be abraded or cut back to produce fair curves or a fair line, relative to the undamaged portion of the panel or panels, of the body of the automobile. Thus, it will be appreciated that once again, an amount of hand and manual work is required, which as stated above, is hard, tedious and tome consuming. Methods and arrangements used up until this time have been unable to satisfactorily conform to curved surface shapes of material being finished, and thus cannot be satisfactorily used for the final sanding or preparing of such surfaces for painting, varnishing and other finishes. In addition to the above, rotary sanders and surface grinders and to a certain extent orbital sanders , operate with such an action that when using a coarse grit, or even a moderately coarse grit or abrasive surface, the surface being treated is often marred with scour marks, such as for example circular scour marks. Even though it may be possible to remove these with a good hand finish, such scour marks often require a substantial amount of hand sanding or hand work before they are effectively removed. Oribital sanders used up until this time cannot, it has been found, operate hard up against any projecting surface. For example, against curves or angles at an overlap point in any horizontal weatherboard sheeting of a house, or even in a vertical board and batten sheating. The action of an orbital sander causes banging and often action against projecting surfaces, and sometimes denting or damaging of the projecting surfaces. Belt sanders have been used up until this time in certain areas of surface treatment. Such arrangements have not normally been capable of being used for sanding or treatment, hard up against any projection, as the belts usually run centrally over rollers and an intermediate platten. In models which have been designed and manufactured to allow relatively close sanding, this is often restricted to one side of the machine. In the case of sanding such surfaces of vertical board and batten walls, using belt sanders, this would require the machine to be reversed. Thus, in such cases, the contact surface of the sandpaper or abrasive belt, would tend to drive the machine downward. This then requires some degree of strength to allow sufficient control or operation, which is particularly tiring from an operators point of view. In certain belt sanders used up until this time, it has also been a problem that the belts sometimes become dislodged and removed from the rollers and plattens this causing delays and in some cases damage. Further problem with belt sanders used up until this time, is that sanding work and thus surface treatment effectively only takes place under the central platten and not under the end rollers. Thus, it is not possible with belt sanders known up until this time, to effectively and fully sand into corners and similar locations. Problems have also been encountered with known arrangements used for cleaning, polishing, buffing and the like. It will be appreciated from the above that there are a number of known methods and arrangements for use in surface treatment. It will also be appreciated however that there are a number of problems associated therewith. It is a further object of the invention to provide a straight forward and efficient arrangement of surface treatment. According to one aspect of this invention there is provided an arrangement for use in surface treatment including at least two elongate operating members so mounted as to be capable of longitudinal movement relative to one another drive means being provided and so adapted as to impart a longitudinal, reciprocal movement to each of the operating members characterised in that each of the operating members is resilient or flexible so as to allow the operating members to conform to predetermined shapes, configurations and contours and the arrangement includes at least two spaced apart handles or grip members being mounted at substantially adjacent ends of the operating members each handle or grip member being pivotally mounted on a connecting means engaged between the operating members and wherein the undersides of said operating members are formed or provided for surface treatment and or have attached thereto material for surface treatment. It will be appreciated from the above, that there are a number of problems associated with methods and arrangements used for surface treatment up until this time. The present invention effectively sets out to overcome or minimise one or more of these problems, by providing an arrangement which incudes at least two elongate operating members, formed of an appropriate material. The underside of the operating members are either formed to allow for surface treatment, or have attached thereto, material to facilitate surface treatment. The operating members are connected to one another, in a basically side by side manner, and are associated with a prime mover and drive means. The prime mover and drive means are so adapted that on operation of the prime mover the drive means imparts an alternate reciprocating movement to each of the operating members so that they reciprocate on their longitudinal axes, relative to each other. It has been found that the reciprocating movement of the operating members relative to each other, provides for particularly effective, controlled and straight forward surface treatment. In particular the reciprocal movement of the operating members of the present invention as will be appreciated from the following description , provides an effective means of achieving a good surface finish and fair line. The present invention also provides an arrangement whereby the alternating reciprocal movements of the operating members compensate for each other to a certain extent to at least reduce the effort required on the part of the operator s . The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein The arrangement of the present invention includes at least two elongate operating members 2, in the form of elongate lengths of suitable material, such as wood, fibreglass, metal, synthetic resin or some other suitable or appropriate material. The underside surfaces 2a of the operating members 2 have attached thereto an appropriate surface or configuration, or have integrally attached thereto or formed therewith, a desired surface or configuration. For example, the undersides 2a of the operating members 2 have matter attached thereto, or are so formed, as to allow for sanding, polishing, buffing, abrading, cutting or the like. Typically a suitable roughened sand paper or abrasive type material can be attached to the undersides 2a of the operating members 2, for use in the sanding of an appropriate surface. It will be appreciated however, that this is by way of example only, and that the underside surfaces of the operating members 2 can be formed of any desired configuration or contour, or can have any appropriate material or surface attached thereof, depending upon the requirements of the user. The operating members 2 can be essentially straight or flat members, but are preferably curved and resilient or tensioned in particular where it is desired to use the arrangement of the present invention for the treatment of curved or generally rounded surfaces . It is particularly advantageous that the operating members be flexible and either resilient or tensioned and at least partially curved, or so constructed of an appropriate material that they have at least some inherent resilience and flexibility, when in use. In a preferred form of the invention, the operating members 2 are constructed of a material which is at least partially flexible or resilient. It will be appreciated that this is not an essential feature of the invention to sand a planar surface but the flexibility and resilience does allow the operating members 2 to conform to the curved shapes, configurations and contours of the work being sanded. In preferred forms of the invention, the two spaced apart elongate operating members 2 are provided, laterally spaced apart a short distance, one from the other, and as will be appreciated hereinafter, means are provided to connect the operating members 2 together, in the essentially spaced apart manner. In a further form of the invention not shown , at least two side by side elongate operating members 2 are used, the adjacent sides thereof, being effectively stepped so that they engage with each other in a stepped manner, this allowing for lateral meshing of adjacent edges of the operating members 2. while at the same time allowing for longitudinal movement therebetween and relative thereto. While the present invention is described with reference to the use of two elongate operating members 2, it should be appreciated that the invention has application to more than two operating members 2. For example three, four or a plurality thereof. In the preferred form of the invention as shown in Figure 4 there are two handles or grip members 10 and 36 pivotally mounted at or toward opposite ends of the operating members 2. Figure 1 of the drawings illustrates a pivotally mounted handle or grip member 10 at the first end 2b of the elongate operating members 2, toward which end a prime mover 15 is also located. The operating members 2 are provided with an appropriate treatment surface on their underside 2a. An arrangement is provided between the elongate operating members 2 and toward their first end 2b which allows for the operating members 2 to be effectively maintained in a reciprocating side by side position, while at the same time allowing for the reciprocating movement to be imparted to each of the operating members 2. In one form of the invention an appropriate mounting block 4 can be provided on upper surfaces 3 on each of the operating members 2. Appropriate attachment means such as screws, bolts or the like extend upwardly therefrom so as to engage with mounting plates 5. This will be described hereinafter. In an alternative form of the invention an appropriate over centre catch means can be provided on the upper surface 3 of the operating members 2, to allow for a quick and effective releasable engagement between the mounting blocks and the upper surfaces 3 of the operating members 2. Other releasable engagement means and arrangements can be used. If desired, an appropriate shock absorbing material 6 such as a flexible or semi flexible shock absorbing material can be provided between mounting blocks 4 or upper surfaces 3 of the operating members 2, and an underside of the mounting plates 5, in order to assist in absorbing vibration and the like brought about by the reciprocal momemt being applied to the operating members 2. In the form of the invention shown in Figure 2 of the drawings, mounting blocks 4 can be provided in an appropriate manner on upper surfaces 3 of the operating members 2 in any appropriate manner with, for example, engagement means in the form of screws or bolts extending upwardly therefrom. Mounting plates 5 with holes provided therein, are then positioned over the mounting blocks 4 so that the upwardly extending bolts or the like, engage within the holes in the mounting plates 5, these then being secured in position such as by nuts and the like. Other means of attachment including releasable attachments, can however be used. Thus, mounting plates 5 are releasably or detachably engaged with or mounted relative to, elongate operating members 2. It is an advantage of the present invention, that the operating members 2 are, in one form, releasably engageable. Thus, it will be appreciated that operating members 2 can therefore be removed for repair or replacement as desired. For example, various sizes, shapes and surfaces can be replaced and modified because of the releasable or replaceable nature of the engagement of the mounting plates 5 and the operating members 2. An elongate connecting plate 7 extends between and over the mounting plates 5, and is pivotally connected to each of the mounting plates 5, while being maintained in a spaced apart position above the mounting plates 5. The connecting plate 7 is pivotally connected to the mounting plates 5 as at 8 and 9 so as to allow for its pivotal movement, on a reciprocating movement being applied to each of the operating members 2. A handle or grip member 10 extends upwardly from the connecting plate 7 to enable the arrangement of the invention to be held and gripped by an operator. In a preferred form of the invention, an operating switch 10a or mechanism is associated with the handle to enable an operator to control the operation of the arrangement. For easy and straight forward operation and for control of the arrangement of the invention, the handle 10 is pivotally mounted to the connecting plate 7. The connecting plate 7 serves to maintain the operating members 2 in a spaced apart yet substantially parallel position relative to each other. The prime mover 15, such as for example an electric motor or some other appropriate prime mover is provided and mounted so as to be adjacent to the mounting plates 5. In the form of the invention shown in Figure 1 of the drawings, the prime mover 15 is in the form of an appropriate electrical motor, connected by a cable or cord 16 to a source of power. Other forms of prime mover can however be used. The prime mover 15 preferably operates drive means which impart a reciprocating movement to each of the operating members 2. In the form of the invention shown in Figure 1 of the drawings, drive means 18 and 17 extend outwardly from the prime mover 15, the drive means 18 and 19 being in the form of at least two elongate shafts 18 and 19, which extend from the prime mover 15 and are also connected to respective mounting plates 5. The elongate drive shafts 18 and 19 are substantially flat shafts in one form of the invention, and are substantially co axial being positioned one on top of the other, the shafts 18 and 19, so mounted to the prime mover 15 that on actuation of the prime mover 15, the drive shafts 18 and 19 reciprocate oppositely. Link members 20,21 are provided which extend outwardly and substantially transversely of the longitudinal axes of the shafts 18,19 so that said lines 20 extending outwardly and transversely from the upper or top elongate shaft 18 are suitably connected or attached to the mounting plate 5a, while the links 21, extending outwardly from the bottom or lower elongate shaft 19 are attached to the mounting plate 5b, Figure 2 of the drawings . Carrier means are provided for mounting the prime mover 15, the carrier means being in the form of elongate carrier shafts 28 which extend outwardly from the prime mover 15, and are positioned immediately above and below and substantially co axial with the drive shafts 18,19. The drive shafts 18,19 preferably have elongate slots 27 therein, and suitable securing means such as bolts, screws and the like are passed through the upper and lower carrier shafts 28 and through the slots in the drive shafts 18,19 to be secured in this position. In this way, the carrier means 28 and drive means 18,19 are secured one to the other the carrier means 28 preferably being formed of a relatively rigid or strong material, which allows the prime mover 15 to be thereby supported relative to the mounting plates 5. Thus, in use, once the prime mover 15 is acutated by for example operation of the switch 10a or operating means on a handle 10 , the drive shafts 18,19 will be caused to oppositely reciprocate, the drive shafts 18,19 reciprocating in the path defined by the spaced apart carrier shafts 28, this being possible due to the elongate slots in the drive shafts 18,19. The opposing reciprocating movements being applied to the drive shafts 18,19 are in turn imparted to the operating members 2, through the links 20 and 21 and mounting plates 5. Thus, on actuation of the prime mover 15, the operating members 2 are caused to alternately reciprocate in substantially longitudinal direction so as to be applied against a surface to be treated. In the preferred form of the invention, the elongate operating members 2 are laterally spaced apart one from the other. Mounting plates 5 and the pivotally mounted handle or grip member 10 as well as prime mover 15 are provided adjacent the first end 2b. At or adjacent the second end 2c of the operating members 2, mounting plates 30 are provided and are attached to the upper surfaces 3 of the operating members 2 a connecting plate 35 being pivotally connected at each end to mounting plates 30 so as to connect the free ends of operating members 2 together in a basically spaced apart manner, and so allow for reciprocal movement of the operating members 2 relative to each other. A handle or grip 36 is pivotally connected to the connecting plate 35. Both handles or grip members 10 and 36 extend upwardly from connector plates 7 on which they are mounted, so that by gripping handles 10 and 36, located at the ends of the operating members, an operator can apply bending, curving or torsional moments to the operating members. Alternatively, the apparatus of this invention can be used by two operators, one at each end. This is of particular advantage, where the operating members 2 are of relatively substantial length and where for example, the surface to be treated is arcuate or curved. In this case preferably flexible pre tensioned and or curved operating members 2 are used. In use, on certain surfaces and in certain circumstances, it may be that the reciprocal movement of the operating members 2 will cause a slight scissor effect, such that it is desirable to form or modify mountings of the operating members 2 to allow for and accommodate such movement. For example, mountings of the apparatus can be provided with elongate slots so that the operating members 2 can be maintained in a substantially side by side relationship notwithstanding the movement thereof. It should be appreciated that the reciprocal movement or moment being applied to the operating members 2, is such that a vibratory moment is, in many circumstances, also applied to the operating members 2. The present invention is described with reference to the prime mover 15 being in the form of an electrical motor. It should be appreciated that the prime mover 15 can be of any appropriate form. For example, the prime mover 15 and drive means can be operated by means of pneumatics, air pressure cylinders, hydraulics, internal combustion, steam, magnetic drive, spring return mechanisms or the like. In some forms of the invention it is considered that it may be desirable, in order to assist maintaining contact between the undersides of the operating members and a surface to be treated , to use one or more weights not shown along the length of one or more operating members 2. For example, these can be clipped on, secured in any desired manner or attached by magnetic means and the like. Alternatively, magnetic, gaseous or air pressure force weight could be applied in order to assist in maintaining the operating members 2 against a surface to be treated. It will be appreciated that in certain circumstances, it may be particularly advantageous to apply such weight, given that a continuity of pressure throughout the length of the operating member 2, during a sanding or buffing operation, is important to an effective operation and satisfactory end result. The present invention has been described by way of example only and with reference to the accompanying drawings in connection with two spaced apart elongate operating members 2. A great number of operating members 2 can be used if desired.
