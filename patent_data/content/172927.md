# A door stop.

## Abstract
A door stop has a base plate 12 on which is mounted a bracket 14 . The base plate is a flat sheet having a slot 16 in which slides a pin 24 located on the bracket. The bracket is hinged to the base plate by means of a pin 18 and has spaced apart upstanding formations 22 which are arranged to abut the side surfaces of a door in the operative position to hold the door captive. Movement of the bracket beyond the extreme positions is checked by stop means. The base plate includes means to accomodate the bracket in two positions enabling the door stop to be used for left and right hand opening doors.

## Claims
I CLAIM 1. A door stop comprising an element and a base plate for mounting with a door, the element being hinged on an axis for rotation between a first position in which a forward surface of a door is adapted to strike at least one of two spaced apart members formed on the element and a second position in which the members abut the forward and rear surfaces of the door, the base plate including a stop member arranged to restrict movement of the element beyond the extremes of the first and second positions. 2. A door stop according to claim 1 in which the element is mounted on the base plate and hinged on an axis passing through the base plate. 3. A door stop according to claim 1 or claim 2 in which one or both spaced apart members formed on the element are arranged to lie in the path of movement of the forward surface of the door such that on striking one of the members the other member is moved to abut the rear surface of the door and hold the door captive between opposed faces of the members. 4. A door stop according to any one of claims 1 to 3 in which the base plate is removably attached to the element and includes means for receiving the element in at least two positions.

## Description
This invention relates to a door stop and in particular to a door stop for holding a door captive in the open position.In the prior art various types of door stops have been known. One such door stop is described in UnitedStates Patent 1,626,422 Mutispaugh in which a swinging member has a tapered nose which provides a sliding surface for the door to engage in the open position. This device engages the undersurface of the door and hence the door will have to be hung above a pre determined level from the surface of the floor. In United States Patent No.230,422 Kelly is described a door stop which engages the door from the underside of the base. The door stop described in United States Patent No. 1,494,790 Kuhrt can only be mounted after structrual changes to the floor above which the door is hung are effected.United States Patent No. 1,667,771 Chiapparelli a door stop is arranged to operate from a recess formed in the floor. In United States Patent 245,082 Massey a door stop is arranged to engage the undersurface of the door. The door stop shown in United States PatentNo. 914,798 Connor engages the upper surface of a door.United States Patent No. 1,280,048 Lavender describes a door stop in which a swinging member has an extreme position in which it is checked by a part of a wall of other fixed structure located close to the door. It is an object of the invention to provide a door stop which mitigates the disadvantages of the prior art and is simple to operate.According to the invention a door stop comprises an element and a base plate for mounting with a door, the element being hinged on an axis for rotation between a first position in which a forward surface of a door is adapted to strike at least one of two spaced apart members found on the element and a second position in which the members abut the forward and rear surfaces of the door, the base plate including a stop member arranged to restrict movement of the element beyond the extremes of the first and second positions.In a preferred form of the invention the element is mounted on the base plate and hinged on an axis passing through the base plate. Preferably the spaced apart members are formed on the element and arranged to lie in the part of movement of the forward surface of the door, such that on striking one of the members the other member is moved to abut the rear surface of the door and hold the door captive between opposed faces of the members.Preferably the door stop member comprises a pin connected to the element and arranged to slide in a groove formed in the base plate which includes a second stop formation located remote from the groove. The base plate is preferably removably attached to the element and includes means for receiving the element in at least two positions such that the door stop may be used for both right hand and left hand operating doors.The element and the base plate are preferably mountable on a floor of the building such that in the open position of the door a forward surface of the door strikes one of opposed faces of the element to cause the other opposed face to move in the path of the door. In striking this opposed face the first opposed face moves in to hold the door captive in position. The door may preferably be released from this position by moving one of the opposed faces clear of the part circumscribed by the edge of the door thus permitting opening or closing thereof.An embodiment of the invention is described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawing in which is seen a perspective view of a door according to the invention.Referring to the drawing a door stop 10 comprises a base plate 12 on which is mounted a bracket 14.The base plate 12 comprises a flat sheet which is triangular in plan and having a slot 16 formed approximately midway of the triangle. The bracket 14 is hinged on a shaft 18 which is mounted on the plate 12 and passes through a bore formed in the plate. A further bore 19 is formed in the plate 12. A screw 20 carrying a sleeve is mounted at the apex of the base plate 12. The base plate 12 is fixed on the floor of a building in a conventional manner and arranged to lie in the path of the circle circumscribed by an edge of the door 26.The bracket 14 comprises a plate having spaced apart upstanding formations 22. The surface 23 of one of the upstanding formations 22 is contoured to form a nosing section. The distance between the upstanding formations 22 corresponds substantially to the thickness of the door 26 such that the door may be held captive between these faces. A pin 24 connected to the undersurface of the bracket 14 is mounted for movement in the slot 16.In use of the invention the door stop 10 is mounted in a position in which a door has to be anchored, which generally is in the fully opened position. The door stop 10 is mounted with the shaft 18 located at the rear side of the door such that when the door moves from the closed to the open position the forwa rd edge strikes the nose 23 which causes the bracket 14 to move outwardly and the edge of the door to strike the inside face of the formation 22 which in turn causes the formation 22 having the nose 23 to move back into position and engage the door 26. Movement beyond the extreme positions is checked by the pin 22 sliding in a slot 16 and by the screw 20. When the door is to be closed the formation 22 having the nose 23 is moved outwardly using the foot thus releasing the engaging position of the door stop 10 and enabling the door 26 to be closed. The base plate 12 has an additional bore 19 which enables the screw 20 to be mounted therein and the shaft 18 to take the place of the screw 20 hence enabling it to be used for doors opening in a direction opposite to that seen in the drawing.The features disclosed in the foreoging description, in the following claims and or in the accompanying drawings may, both separately and in any combination thereof, be material for realising the invention in diverse forms thereof.
