# IMPROVEMENTS IN WASHING MACHINES FOR MECHANICAL PARTS

## Abstract
A machine for washing mechanical parts, in which the parts to be washed are moved through the interior of the machine, for example by means of a step by step system. Two end uprights 2 are provided on which rests a chassis which carries conventional mechanical and washing assemblies, the chassis having no intermediate props or supports. The chassis comprises two lower beams con nected by smaller transverse beams 6 to an upper longitu dinal beam 5 , this assembly forming a composite beam. The chassis is enclosed on the underside by a lower channel, and on its upperside by a concave longitudinal lid 8 . This lid is mounted so that it can rotate around the longitudinal axis of the machine, to allow access to the inside of the machine.
