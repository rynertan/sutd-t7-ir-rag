# Magnetic toner and method of developing magnetic images.

## Abstract
Magnetic toner comprising a styrene butadiene copolymer resin, and a cubically shaped magnetite material, which toner has a fusing latitude range of at least 16 degrees Centrigrade up to a maximum temperature of 199 degrees Centigrade. Toners having melt fusing temperatures of from about 149 degrees Centrigrade to about 191 degrees Centigrade are desirable. The preferred cubical magnetite used is Mapico Black, which is present in amounts of from about 40 percent to about 70 percent. The toners of the present invention are useful for example in magnetic imaging systems. especially systems employing heat pressure fusing and high speed fusing systems.
