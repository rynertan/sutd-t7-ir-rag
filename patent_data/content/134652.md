# APPARATUS FOR EXTRACTING AND INVERTING THE HOUSING COVER OF A HYDRAULIC LIFT MECHANISM OF A TRACTOR

## Abstract
A service tool to be fitted to a tractor to extract and support the cover 2 of the housing 2A of a hydraulic lift mechanism. The tool includes a hoist 9 by which the cover 2 is lifted from the housing. The hoist 9 is supported on a pivotal structure comprising rigid links 4, 10 and the structure is swung bodily together with the hoist 9 and the cover 2 after it has been raised and secured to the hoist 9 in a clockwise direction, as viewed in Figure 2, to withdraw the cover 2 from a position beneath the cab 3 of the tractor. The pivotal movement of the links 4 and 10 is limited by a stop pin 17 slidable in a slotted arm 14 also forming part of the structure. The hoist 9 together with the cover 2 is then swung about a pivot 7 to invert the cover, the arm 14 holding the inverted cover 2 displaced laterally from the housing 2A.
