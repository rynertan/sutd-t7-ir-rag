# Spool for use in carbon fiber oxidation and method for manufacturing same.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a non expanding spool 10 suitable for use in oxidation of green spun carbon fibers, subsequent to fiber spinning and prior to carbonization. The spool 10 is a hollow tube 14 formed, suitably on a mandrel, from a multi ply, multidirectional woven graphite cloth 32 impreg nated with a thermosetting resin, e.g. polyimide. A plurality of hoop fiber filaments 34 are wrapped around it and become impregnated with the thermosetting resin. The resulting spool is then baked or cured at elevated tempera tures. The baked spool is then provided, for example by piercing, with a large number of geometrically or randomly disposed holes or openings 12 .
