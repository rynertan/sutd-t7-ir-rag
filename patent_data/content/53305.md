## Description
WITHA PACKING CONTAINER SUCTION TUBE AND A METHOD FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF THE he present invention relates to a packing container comprising tro adjoining wall panels, situated at an angle to one another, and a suction tube applied to the outside. The present invention also relates to a method for the application of a suction tube to a packing container comprising two adjoining wall panelsv diuated at an angle to one another. Beverages ready for consumption such as juices and the like are often packed in non returnable packages, from which the beverages are intended to be consumed directly with the help of a suction tube. For this purpose the packing container is provided with a specially marked area in which the packing material is weakened so as to facilitate penetration of the material, rhen the suction tube is to be introduced in connection with the consumption of the contents. The suction tube is furnished either separately at the point of sale, or else it is applied in certain types of packages to the outside of each individual packing container. The suction tube is wrapped in an envelope of paper or plastic, which envelope is attached by means of an adhesive to a side wall of the packing container.To make it possible to apply, a suction tube which is as long as possible to a packing container of e.g. parallelepipedic form, the suction tube is placed diagonally over the largest rectangular side wall. In this way it is made possible to utilize a suction tube of a length convenient to the user without the suction tube, when it is applied to the packing container, extending outside the boundary line of the side wall, which would act as an obstacle in the handling of the packing container and would mesn,moreover, very probably that damage to the suction tube by buckling would be a very common occurrence. The abovementioned technique of application of the suction tube has been used successfully on parallelepipedic packages, since in such packages relatively large plane side walls are available for the attachment of the suction tube. In the type of packing containers which are generally described as gable top or ridge type package , however, it has not been possible Xp to now to apply suction tubes of sufficient length, since this type of BsckByg container has relatively small, connected, wall surfaces. A suction tube of the length required for the purpose will, therefore, unavoidably ext ui outside the contours of the packing container with the aforementioned disadvantages as a consequence. It is an object of the present invention to overcome the aboyementioned disadvantages in the application of auction tubes to packing conin4 rJ and to provide a packing container of the ridge type with a suction tube which, in spite of the rev ires length, does not extend outside the contours of the packing container in applied condition. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a packing container of the ridge type with an externally applied suction tube, which packing container has a conventional, well knowa basic design which is not tsmdetRd more complicated or expensive by the application of the suction tube. These and other objects have been achieved in accordance with the invention in that a packing container comprising two wall panels adjoining ene another, situated at an angle to one another and an externally applied suction tube has been given the characteristic that the suction tube is bent and is applied so that it extends over the said wall panels, the place of bending coinciding with a folding line located between the panels. preferred embodiments of the packing container in accordance with the invention have been given the further characteristics which are evident from the subsidiary claims 2 to 8 inclusive. Ridge packages of the type used for the packing of beverages ready for consumption are usually of 1 4 litre size, and for this size of package the invention makes possible the use of a suction tube of a length which is almost double the size of the greatest possible length of a suction tube which is attached in a conventional manner, that is to say diagonally over a single wall panel.In that the suction tube is bent in accordance with the invention and is placed over a side wall panel as well as over a top wall panel of the packing. container extending at en angle to the sane, any bending which is so strong that there is a ick of damage to the suction tube is avoided, since the angle between the said panels on packing container accoS modating 1 4 litre is relatively obtuse and reaches appro. 1200. If the suction tube is made of relatively flexible plastic material, e.g. polypropylene or HDPE, the risk of buckling of the suction tube at this bending angle is small. In accordance with the invention the suction tube is placed appropriately so that it extends along the common diagonal line of the two panels, which not only allows a maximum length of suction tube, but also reduces the neoessery bending of the suction tube, since the suction tube, as a result of extending obliquely over the folding line between the two panels is given a bending angle V which is greater more obtuse than the angle 4 between the panels. Xhe risk of the suction tube being buakled or damaged in connection with the bending or handling is reduced further, if the suction tube is made of a flexible plastic material and is provided with a beading indication aeg. in the form of a bellow type fold. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a rapid and safe method for the mechanical and automatic application of the suction tube to A Packing container without either the ùctiontube or the packing con trainer being damaged. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a method for the application of the suction tube to two wall panels of a packing container which are situated at an angle to one another. These and other objects have been achieved in accordance with the invention in that a method for applying a suction tubeto a packing con tainer comprising two adjpining wall waLl ela , situated at an angle to one another has been given the characteristic that the suction tube is made to rest against and to be joined to both wall panels with the help of adhesive. Preferred embodiments of the method in accordance with the invention have been given the characteristics which are evident from the subsidiary claims 10 to 21 inclusive.the method in accordance with the invention makes possible the mechanical application and attachment of a suction tube to two adjoining wall panels on a packing container situated at an angle to one another. Through the various embodiments of the method in accordance with the invention is made possible the application of a straight suction tube with subsequent bending as well as the bending of the suction tube to the required angle and subsequent application. In accordance with one embodiment, a certain pre benithg of the tube is also made use of rnich makes it possible to utilize a suction tube of relatively rigid and unyielding material. Preferred embodiments of the packing container as well as of the method in accordance with the invention will now be described in greater detail with special reference to the enclosed schematic drawing, which merely show the details necessary for the understanding of the invention. Big.l shots in perspective a preferred embodiment of the packing contanner in accordance with the invention including the applied suction tube. Fig.2 is a side view of a auction tube bent at an angle B. Fig.3 shows schesatically the packing container in accordance with the invention from the sides and illustrates the location of an angle between one top will panel and the adjoining side wall panel of the packing container. s preferred embodiment of the packing container in accordance with the invention comprises a conventionally desired so callcd ridge type package with a volume of 1 4 litre. This type of package is used e.g. for juices and the ADke ready for drink and is manufactured fron a flexible laminated material which comprises a central carrier layer of fibrous material, e.g.paper, which is covered on both sides by thermoplastic material polyetbylene rhich on the one hand serves to make the laminate liquid tights on the other hank rakes possible heat sealing. The laminate is fed to a machine for forming, filming and closing of the packing containers in the form of flattened, tubular blanks of square cross section.In the machine the blnnk is converted to a packing container which is filled and closed so as to obtain the maix shape as shown in fig. 1. More precisely, each packing container comprises a base, not visible in fig.l and side wall panels 1,2 parallel in pairs and joined to the same in the figure only two side wall panels are visible . The side wall panel 1, like the opposite side wall panel not visible is connected at its upper end to a top wall panel 3 which, together with a number of partly visible backfolding panels 4,T forms a ridgelike packing top part, crowed by a eealing fin 6 in which the individual wall folda are sealed in a liquid tight tanner to one another. The packing container in accordance with the invention also comprises one or more weakened areas 7,8 to make possible the introduction of a suction tube into the packing container, when the contents are to be consumed. The weakened areas or suction tube holes 7,8 preferably consist of holes punched out of the material which are of a diameter substantially correeponding to the diaaeter of the suction tube used, and are covered by one or more layers of plastic or aluminum foil, which layer, however, is of relatively small thickness, so that it can be penetrated in a simple manner by means of the suction tube end. Finally the packing container in accordance with the invention also comprises an externally placed suction tube 9, which preferably is placed into an envelope 10 adapted to the shape and length of the suction tube. The suction tube as well as the envelope are preferably made of a flexible plastic material and the suction tube g is applied so that it extends over the side wall panel 1 as well as over the top wall panel 3. More precisely, the suction tube 9 is bent at a centrally located place which coincides with a folding line 11 between the wall panels 1 and 3.In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the packing container, the suction tube is placed so, moreover, that it extends cibctantially along the joint diagonal of the two wall panels 1 and 3. The design of the packing containers in accordance with the invention rith the suction tube bent and placed along the joint diagonal of the adjoining wall panels, makes it possible to join the auction tube to the container wall in such a manner that the suction tube does not with any part of it extend outside the contour of the packing container. This is necessary so as to prevent the suction tube from becoming damaged er unstucken handling of the g container.The placing of the suction tube makes it also possible to utilize a suction tube of such a lengthj that on being used it cannot diseppear down into the packing container, that is to say,the .length of.the suction tube is greater than the maximum distance between the suction tube hole 7 or 8 and the most distant inner corner of the packing container een from the suction tube hole. This has not been possible earlier, with a conventional placing of the suction tube diagonally over one of the side wall penels since the space available them did not make possible an application of a suction tube of a length greater than the said inner distance in the packing container. Earlier attempts to apply a suction tube over more than one wall surface on the packing container have often failed Qsx account of the suction tube being exposed to damage by buckling. By applying the suction tube diagonally over a top wall panel and a side wall panel, the suction tube will be bent at an angle V fig2 which is greater than the angle alpha fig.3 between the two wall panels and smaller than 1800. The diagonal placing of the suction tube means that the suction tube extends obliquely over the folding line 11, so that the angle V of the suction tube will become greater than the angle between the two adjoining wall panels. In the conventionally shaped packing container.mentioned earlier with a volume of 1 4 litre, the angle is typically between 110 1200, which gives an angle for the suction tube of between 1300 and 1400 when. the suction tube is applied diagonally in accordance with the invention. Suction tubes manufactured of flexible plastic material, L prefer red. materials being polypropylene or BDPE high density polyethylene , may be bent readily at this angle in cold condition, that is to eay,bent elastically withent keing demaged an without any difficulties arising when the suction tube is returned to its normal straight form. In order to facilitate further the bending, especially when the suction tube is made of other, less flexible plastic material, the suction tube may be provided with a bending indication e. x centrally located part with a slightly oval or flat crose section or one or adore bellows folds.The placing of the part provided with bending indication centrally on the suction tube allows the retaining of the relatively rigid end parts of the suction tube, which facilitates ge, end in particular the penetration of the suction tube hole or the packing container wall on consumption. The attachment of the suction tube on the wall panels of the packing sontxer is done preferably by means of thermoplastic hesive which is applied between the wall panels and the two ends of the suction tube. over the attachment may also be done by a different technique e.g.self edhesive strips or the like. As mentioned earlier, the suction tube is generally wrapped in a suction tube envelope which ay be manufactured of a thin, flexible plastic material or paper. In the description and to the claims the term suction tube is used to describe the suction tube proper as well as the suction tube wrapped in a suitable envelope, since hoth sariants occur in practice without having any effect on either the location of the suction tube, the bending of the suction tube or any other parameter significant for the invention. The application of a suction tube to a packing container and the bending of the same in accordance with the invention may be carried out in a number of different ways. It is a common feature of the different methods in accordance with the invention1 all of which will be described in the following, however, that the suction tube is applied to two adjoining wall panels of the packing container situated at an angle to one another,by virtue of the suction tube being made to rest against and be joinedtto both wall panels with the help of adhesive. In accordance with the different embodiments of the method in accordance with the invention, the bending of the suction tube may take place either at the same time as the application of the same to the packing container, before the application of the suction tube to the packing container or through a combination of both these procedures.ill these methods will be described in the following. In accordance with a first embodiment of the method in accordance with the invention, the suction tube is bent at the same time as it is applied to the packing container More precisely, the procedure is so that the ready filled and closed packing container is provided with a coating of thermoplastic material, so called hot melt on the side wall panel 1 rhich adjoins directly the top wall panel 3 situated above The adhesive is applied to one bottom corner of the side wall panel 1, whereupon a suction tube 9, possible wrapped in an envelope, is brought into contact with the hot melt before the same has hed time to cool off. The suction tube i given here a direction which coincides with the ultimate diagonal placing.Then further hot melt is applied to the corresponding top wall panel 3 end, more precisely, to the opposite top corner of the same. Subsequently the suction tube is bent in cold condition, so that its free end will rest against the top wall panel 3 end the still warm and soft adhesive, which has been applied to the spme. By this method the bending of the suction tube will take place auto magically in the right position, since the edge 11 between the top wall panel and the side wall panel acts as a holding up surface during the bending operation.Furthermore, the suction tube will automatically be given the right bending angle if it is ensured that it rests against the side wmfl panel as well as against the top wall panel. After the adhesive applied to the upper part of the top wall panel has set, the suction tube will be fired in the desired position on the packing container, ready to be detsched snd used when the con tsit of the packing container are to be consumed. After detebment, the suction tube 9 on account of its inherent flexibility auto maticnlly resumes its original straight form. The method described has been found to function with great safety also at sigh manufacturing speed and the method is, moreover, simple and applicable in most cases when a filled and closed packing container of the ridge type is to be provided with an attached suction tube, possibly provided with a protective envelope. As an alternative to the method described above, it is also possible to bend the suction tube before the application of the same to the packing container, which is particularly appropriate if the suction tube is intended to be bent permanently, that is to say,if it is to be heated before the bending so that the bending kill be plastic. Such a suction tube will thus be angled, even after detachment from the packing container, which of course shortens a little the effective length of the suction tube, but makes it possible to use a particularly rigid and strong suction tube material, e.g.RIPS High Impact Polystyrene which sometimes may be desirable. The method presumes that the angle V over which the suction tube is to be bent, will be calculated in advance, which can be done in a fairly simple manner, since the angle alpha between the top wall panel and the side wall panel is knout end it 18 only necessary to compensate for the reduction of the bending angle which stems from the diagonal placing of the suction tube obliquely over the folding line 11. In a ridge package of conventional shape which holds 2.5 dl, the angle Q is thus generally lioc 120 , 120 , which gives e angle V of 130 140 . Instead of calculating the angle V with the guidance of the angle it is of course possible in a sinple manner, to determine a suitable angle V empirically. By bending the suction tube prior to application, a heating of the auction tube to the softening temperature of the suction tube material is thus made possible1 so that the bending can be made permanent. This is ,eo difficult to carry out in the firstmentioned method in accordance with the invention, since heating of the suction tubeJafter the same has been placed directly adjoining the packing container, would be difficult to sealizeoving to the risk of damage to the packing container wall which, as xentioed previously, is coated with an external thermoplastic layer. In accordance with s third embodiment of the method in accordance with the invention, use is made of plastic as well as elastic bending of the suction tube, and this embodiment can be said to constitute a combination of the two firstmentioned embodiments. This third method of applying av suction tube to a packing container of the ridge type is used when a suction tube material is employed which has a certain, albeit limited, inherent flexibility.This may be the case e.g. when the suction tube material in itself is relatively flexible polypropylene , but where the suction tube yen account of its wall thickness is liable to the risk of buckling on being bent to the desired angle V in cold condition. ero it is possible, prior to its application to the packing container to heat the suction tube end bend it to an angle V7 which is substantially equal angle 180 alpha alpha 2 , so that EMI8.1 sub sequently on application it ean be bent elastically to an angle V2, which is smaller more acute than the angle V1 and normally coincides with angle V. In other words, the suction tube is heated before the application and bent over approximately half the angle from straight condition to the desired final angle, so that the suction tube will permanently be at this angle, whereupon, after application and in accordance with the embodiment 1 described above, an elastic bending and attachment of the suction tube to the wall panel of the packing container are performed.After detachment of a suction tube thus prepared, the suction tube will return to the angle V1, which to sone extent Ehortens the usable, active length of the suction tube, but not to such a high degree as in accordance with the embodiment troy where the suction tube remains completely in the bent position, that is to say, at an angle V between the two halves of the suction tube. whilst in all three embodiments of the method in accordance with the invention described above it is assumed that the suction tube is applied to a filled and ready formed packing container , the suction tube is being applied to the packing container, in accordance with a fourth embodiment of the method according to the invention, already before the same has been fully formed and obtains its ridge shaped top pert.In contrast to the earlier methods, the attachment of the suction tube is taking place here whilst the packing container is still in the filling machine, which is an advantage inasmuch as the packing container, when it leaves the v chiaelis completely finiehed and vided with suction tube, so that it can be packed directly in the collective package, e.g. be entrapped in shrink film and be conveyed to the retailer and consumer. In the manufacture of the individual packing containers these are formed as zeetioned previously, from a tubular blank of square cross section, which blenk is provided in the filling machine with a base and is filled with the desired contents, whereupon the ritype top part is formed and the material layers included are joined together in a liquid tight manner so that the sealing fin 6 is formed.The application of the suction tube to the well panels of the packing container is taking place here prior to the formation of the ridge like top part on the packing container, that is to say, whilst the top wall panel 3 is still in vertical position in the same plane aa the side wall panel 1.The suction tube can be applied to the packing container , therefore, and joined to the two adjoining wall panels 1,3 in straight condition, so as to be bent aubsequently to the desired angle at the same time as the formation of the top part of the packing container, that is to say, at the same time as the folding down of the top wall panel 3 to the position shown in fig. 1. The application of the suction tube takes place preferably, as mentioned previously, with the help of a heat sealable adhesive, which is applied to diagonally opposite corners of the rectangular surface which is formed by the side wall panel 1 and the top wall panel 3.The suction tube is then applied diagonally over the said panels and the adhesive is allowed to dry before the top wall panel is folded down so that the desired angle of 110 120 is formed. On fol ing down, he suction tube will be bent into the correct position over the folding line 11 without any further measures having to be taken. This method ensures a rapid and con tinuous manufacture when all the packing containers coming off the packing and filling machine are to be provided with suction tubes, but in return requires a certain amount af redesign of the packing machines which are used at present. In the casea where the bending of the suction tube is to be pe ent, the suction tube,.or rather that part of the suction tube on which the bending is to take place ls heated to the softening temperature of the suction tube material prior to bending, whereupon the suction tube becomes plastic and the bending can take place without any risk of buckling of the suction tube, In order to prevent the suction tube from being flattened or in some other Lamier being deformed in an undesirable anner in connection with the bending, it is appropriate to support the suction tube during the actual bending inter nally by means of a spiral spring or the like. It is also possible merely to heat the suction tube to softening temperature on the side on which the suction tube material during the bending operation will be stretched, that is to eay the side remote from the packing container. Through this techniques the deformation of the suction tube is limited to a certain flattening on the heated side, which flattentig,though, has no negative effect on the suction of the tube.The temperature used for heating the suction tube is adopted to the suction tube material used, and a suitable softening temperature for potypropylene is thins 155 170 C whilst a suitable corresponding temperature for EDPE is 110 125 C. Although the suction tube in the package as well as in the method in accordance with the inveNtion has been described as non wrapped, it will be understood in the description ss well as in the patent claim, that the suction tube can be provided with a protective envelope which , for reasons of hygiene, is very often the case. The protective envelope is mainly flattened tubular and may consist of paper or plastic material. When the pro tective envelope is made of plastic material it is appropriate to ensure that the softening temperature of this plastic material is higher than that of the plastic material of which the suction tube is made, since this sakes it possible to heat and bend the suction tube whilst it is located inside the suction tube envelope. For the rest,thepuction tube can be treated substantially in similar manner in accordance with all the embodiments of the method according to the invention, irrespectively of whether it is enwrapped in an envelope or not.
