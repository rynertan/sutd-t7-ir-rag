# Coaxial cable incorporated with induction cable.

## Abstract
A coaxial cable comprises a carrier cable 2 with a center conductor 4 which is filled with an insulator 5 and covered with an insulator 6 , at least one induction cable 3 with an induction wire 7 covered with an insulator 8 , and an outer conductor 9 covering the carrier cable 2 and the induction cable 3 . To avoid unwanted piezoelectric effects induced in the dielectric substances subjected to possible physical pressure and to increase the induced output of the coaxial cable, the induction cable 3 is helically wound on the carrier cable 2 .
