# Differential amplifier.

## Abstract
Each cascaded amplifier stage comprises two input transistors 118, 120 and two control transistors 110, 112 respectively supplied with bias voltage V and bias current I. The differential current flowing through transistors 118, 120 is amplified by each stage. By connecting diode loads, D1 D2 D3, D4 and D5, D6 in the connections between the emitters of transistors 118 , 120 and the base collector connections of transistors 110 112 and 120 110 etc., the amplification in each stage is increased so that the differen tial current is amplified at a higher rate than the proportion of I2 I1 I3 I2 etc.
