# STABLE EMULSIONS OF WATER RESISTANT POLYVINYL ALCOHOL STABILIZED VINYL CHLORIDE ETHYLENE COPOLYMERS

## Abstract
A method for preparing a stable vinyl chloride based resin emulsion which comprises a copolymer colloidally dispersed in an aqueous medium, the copolymer having a Tg from 0 to 50 C, about 65 to 90 wt vinyl chloride, about 5 to 35 wt ethylene, 0 to 10 wt olefinically unsaturated co polymerizable monomer and prepared by emulsion poly merization of vinyl chloride, ethylene and, optionally, an olefinically unsaturated comonomer in the presence of about 3 to 15 wt polyvinyl alcohol as the dispersing agent, the polymerization method comprising a forming an aqueous emulsion reaction mixture con taining substantially all the polyvinyl alcohol and a portion, preferably at least 5 , of teh total vinyl chloride monomer, b pressurizing the reaction mixture with an ethylene pressure sufficient to provide the copolymer with a 5 to 35 wt ethylene content. c initiating the reaction mixture by the addition of a free radical generating source and continuing polymeriza tion until the rate of polymerization begins to decrease to provide a prepolymer emulsion, and d adding the remaining vinyl chloride at a substantial ly uniform rate and continuing polymerization until the poly merization reaction is no longer self sustaining, ethylene being neither withdrawn nor added during the polymeriza tion in one embodiment.
