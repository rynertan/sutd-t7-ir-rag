# Low hydrostatic head electrolyte addition to fuel cell stacks.

## Abstract
A fuel cell system for supplying electrolyte, as well as fuel and an oxidant to a fuel cell stack having at least two fuel cells 10 , each of the cells 10 having a pair of spaced electrodes 22, 30 and a matrix 26 sandwiched therebetween, fuel and oxidant paths asso ciated with a bipolar plate 14, 16, 18 separating each pair of adjacent fuel cells and an electrolyte fill path 42 for adding electrolyte to the cells and wetting said matrices. Electrolyte is flowed through the fuel cell stack in a back and forth fashion in a path 62, 64 in each cell substantially parallel to one face of opposite faces of the bipolar plate exposed to one of the electrodes and the matrices to produce an overall head uniformly between cells due to frictional pressure drop in the path for each cell free of a large hydrostatic head to thereby avoid flooding of the electrodes.
