Thus, the active compounds according to the present invention may be used as such or in combination with suitable pharmaceutical diluents and or carrier materials and may be formulated in usual manners. The compounds according to the present invention may be used both in human or veterinary medicine in any desired form such as in systemic form provided that the formulation and maintenance of a sufficient blood and tissue level is produced. This is possible by oral, rectal or parenteral administration of suitable dosages.It is preferred to use pharmaceu tical preparations allowing the administration of single dosages in suitable forms of administration such as tablets, dragées, capsules, suppositories, granulates, solutions, emulsions, suspensions, sols or gels. The dosage of administration in general is between 20 and 50 mg. per day, preferably between 30 and 200 mg. per day and may be administered in a single dose or several doses, preferably in two to b tohr e .daily doses. Suitable carrier materials for the preparation of orally administratable preparations, for instance tablets, capsules, granulates or powders, are for instance calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, starch, suggar, lactose, talcum, magnesium stearate, gelatine, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum arabic, sorbitol, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, carboxymethylcellulose, shellac and the like. Tablets may be coated in usual manners. Liquid products for oral administrations may be aqueous or oily suspensions or solutions. They may also be powderous products with a filler material obtained by deep freeze drying which products are dissolved before administration.The pharmaceutical preparations according to the present invention may also be suppositories for rectal administration containing pharmaceutically acceptable carrier materials such as polyethyleneglycol , lanolin, coconut butter, witepsol or the like. The products may also be prepared for external administration in the form of ointments or creams which are produced in usual manners with usual additives.The following examples serve to further illustrate the present invention without however limiting the same thereto.
