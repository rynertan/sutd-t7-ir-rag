# Graft copolymer plasticized PVC blends as thermoplastic elastomers.

## Abstract
Compositons comprising high rubber ABS graft copoly mers, PVC and plasticizers for PVC are useful as thermoplas tic elastomers. Formulations exhibiting good solvent resist ance, abrasion and compression set characteristics may be used in shoe soling, wire and cable covering, hose and tubing and automotive applications.
