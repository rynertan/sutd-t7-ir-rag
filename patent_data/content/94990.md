# Magnetic coating compositions for magnetic recording materials.

## Abstract
A magnetic coating composition for use in the produc tion of a magnetic recording material is described. The composition is comprised of at least ferromagnetic metal powder and or ferromagnetic alloy powder and nitrocellu lose having an average degree of polymerization of from 10 to 55, or at least ferromagnetic metal powder and or ferromagnetic alloy powder, nitrocellulose having an aver age degree of polymerization of from 10 to 55, and at least one polymeric binder. This magnetic coating composition has excellent dispersibility of the magnetic powder, and can provide a magnetic recording material which has excellent surface smoothness and orientation ratio, as well as excel lent durability.
