# Field coil assembly for a dynamoelectric machine.

## Abstract
A magnetic coil assembly for a dynamoelectric machine comprises a magnetic field coil 26, a magnetic field pole core 14 adapted to be mounted on a rotor 10 of the dynamoelelctric machine, an electrical insulation 38, 42 placed around the magnetic field coil. The electrical insulation is disposed only in the region between the pole core and the straight coil side por tions 44 of the magnetic coil, excluding the coil end portion or the end turns 46 of the coil. The magnetic pole is bevelled at the corners 57 thereof to provide a sufficient insulating dis tance between the coil and the pole.
