## Abstract
A guiding device for a distributor for winding a cable on a flanged reel, which gutding device 6 comprises a traverse tube 17 supported by a traversing device 3 of the distributor for reciprocating the tube between the flanges of the reel. The tube forms a path of movement L for guiding the cable 5 to a free end of the traverse tube. A guide head 20 is provided at the free end of the traverse tube for guiding the path of movement of the cable with respect to the flanges 11, 12 of the reel 9 . The guide head comprises at least one guide surface 24 eccentrically positioned with respect to the path of movement for contacting the flange of the reel. The horizontal distance of the guide surface from the path of movement equals to one and a half times the diameter of the cable to be wound in a first rotation position of the guide tube and to half the diameter of the cable in a second rotation position of the guide tube.
