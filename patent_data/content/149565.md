## Description
This invention is concerned with assays of the kind in which an analyte in a liquid medium is assayed by a method which involves partition of a labelled reagent between a liquid phase and a solid phase. Typically, the assay reagents include a solid phase reagent which may be particulate or in monolithic form e.g. as a coating on an assay tube, and a labelled reagent initially in the liquid phase. Assays of this kind are very well known and include immunoassays and immunometric assays. In most assays, after incubation of the reagents, the solid phase is separated from the liquid phase, and a measurement is made of the amount of label in either the solid phase or the liquid phase. When a particulate solid is used, separation of the two phases has generally been effected by settling slow or by centrifuging fairly quick but difficult to automate . More recently magnetically attractable particles which are suspendable but insoluble in the liquid phase have been used as reagent carriers these have the advantage that they can quickly be separated from the liquid phase by the use of magnets and without the need for centrifuging. European Patent Specification 30086A describes a test tube assembly for use in assays utilising magnetically attractable particles, which comprises a plurality of test tubes mounted in a planar support member, and a planar base member comprising magnets, wherein the support member can be releasably coupled to the base member in such a way that the magnets attract and retain magnetically attractable particles in the tubes, the assembly being invertable to decant liquid from the tubes while retaining magnetically attractable particles therein. In one embodiment, an assay involves the use of a radioactively labelled reagent initially in the liquid phase and another reagent bound to suspendable magnetically attractable particles. The reagents are incubated with samples containing the analyte in test tubes in the support member. This is then coupled to the base member so as to bring down the particles. The assembly is inverted to remove the supernatant liquid. The particles in the tubes are washed and the supernatant liquid again removed. Finally, the radioactivity in each tube is measured by inserting the test tubes in the support member in a multi head counter. While this embodiment is in many ways convenient, it does suffer from the disadvantage that a radioactively labelled reagent is used. Handling radioactivity requires special precautions and equipment which are not always readily available in laboratories that might otherwise perform the assay. Also, multi head counters of radioactivity are rather large and cumbersome items of equipment, due to the need to shield each counting head from radiation from neighbouring counting wells. The European Patent Specification does contemplate the use of non radioactive optical e.g. fluorescent labels. But the only technique described involves precipitating the magnetic particles and then observing optical properties e.g. fluorescence in the resulting supernatant liquid. Such observation is necessarily made from the side of the assay vessel, in order that the precipitate be screened from observation. Multi head equipment for this purpose is not currently available, and would in any case be expensive and cumbersome. No practicable assay system using an optical label is described. European Patent Specification 30087A describes a non competitive immunoassay method utilising magnetically attractable particles which include a receptor for the analyte under assay. An excess of receptor is added and the magnetic particles separated from the solution. Once separated the particles are resuspended and the amount of unbound receptor or amount of analyte bound is determined using a label which may be a radioactive, fluorimetic, luminescent or enzymic group. In order to perform the assay the magnetically attractable particles are either first separated from the liquid or, as is exemplified, drawn to the bottom of the vessel so that the optical properties of the supernatant liquid may be determined from the side of the assay vessel as described in EP 30086A. The present invention results from our discovery that, when magnetically attractable particles carrying a bound labelled reagent which can emit or generate a fluorescent or luminescent signal are re suspended in a liquid medium, it is possible to observe the signal generated by the labelled reagent in the suspension. Furthermore, the strength of the signal bears a definite relationship to the concentration of the labelled reagent. This discovery is surprising, since magnetically attractable particles, unlike conventional solid particles of e.g. polyacrylamide, are necessarily opaque. It would have been reasonable to expect that, as a result of the opaque particles, little or no observable signal would be generated by the labelled reagent in the suspension. This surprising discovery has an important practical consequence. It becomes possible to use a fixed array of assay vessels for performing an assay involving fluorescent or luminescent signals. The signal can be observed from above or below, and no radiation shielding is required, so the assay vessels can be made very small and positioned very close together. In fact, microtiter plates can be used. The present invention provides a method of performing an assay of an analyte in a liquid medium, comprising the use of The method of this invention preferably uses an array of assay vessels in fixed relationship to one another. Use of such an array has practical advantages of ease and speed of handling, which are important where large numbers of repetitive actions have to be carried out. Handling of individual assay vessels is eliminated. Automatic dispensing of different reagents is facilitated. Confusion between assay vessels, which is inevitable when vessels are handled individually, is practically avoided. The array of assay vessels is preferably planar with individual assay vessels arranged regularly in rows and columns. As mentioned above, microtiter plates may be used with advantage. Commercially available microtiter plates are of injection moulded plastic containing 96 wells each of approximately 0.3 ml capacity, arranged in 8 rows of 12.Both clear and opaque white or black plates are available. Microtiter plates are widely used in microbiology, and have been used to a small extent for performing assays of the kind with which this invention is concerned. But such use has been limited by the problems of separating a solid reagent from the liquid phase. While it is possible in principle to coat the sides of each well with a solid phase reagent, it has proved difficult in practice to introduce the same amount of solid phase reagent into each well and for a precise assay, it is necessary that the amount of each reagent in each tube be accurately the same. This difficulty, which has not been overcome, may arise from the moulding technique used to make the plate some wells are inherently more receptive to reagent than others. If a particulate solid phase reagent is used, then two problems arise. Centrifuging microtiter plates is inconvenient. Also, a pellet of solid material results from bringing down a particulate reagent out of suspension, and it is difficult to make useful measurements of any optical signal generated from the pellet. The present invention overcomes all these problems, by using magnetically attractable particles which are re suspended in liquid prior to observing the signal, and permits the widespread use of microtiter plates for immunoassays. The method of this invention involves the use of a labelled reagent which is initially in the liquid phase but which becomes partitioned between liquid and solid phases. While the nature of the label is not critical, the method is particularly well suited for fluorescent and luminescent systems. The label is therefore a group which, when suitably treated, gives rise to a fluorescent or luminescent signal. Fluorescent and luminescent systems are well known in the art and do not in themselves form part of this invention. One known chemiluminescent system involves a peroxidase enzyme with a luminol type substrate. One known fluorescent system involves an alkaline phosphatase enzyme with a methylumbelliferone phosphate substrate. When the signal system is made up of several components, it will be understood that any one of the components may constitute the label of the labelled reagent. The term labelled reagent includes reagents that are labelled after incubation with the assay sample. Similarly, the term reagent bound to magnetically attractable particles includes reagents that are so bound after incubation with the assay sample. Assay techniques of this kind are known, and some are discussed below. Several requirements attach to the magnetically attractable particles used in the method. These particles must carry a reagent which can bind another reagent initially present in the liquid phase. The particles must be suspendable in the liquid phase, preferably without shaking, for a period at least as long as the incubation time of the assay. This requirement suggests particles of small size and density approximating to that of the liquid phase. On the other hand, the particles must be magnetically attractable, preferably to an extent to permit quick and easy separation by magnets from the liquid phase. This requirement suggests a high proportion of ferromagnetic material, necessarily of rather high density. These conflicting requirements have proved somewhat difficult to meet, but there are now commercially available particles of micrometer size comprising powdered iron oxide or magnetite embedded in a plastics matrix, and having a specific gravity of 1.15 to 1.2. The exact nature of the magnetically attractable particles used is not critical to this invention. It is, however, desirable that the particles carry a high concentration of the chosen reagent. If the reagent concentration on the particles is too low, then the Concentration of labelled reagent that becomes bound to the particles during the course of the assay will necessarily be low. Because part of the signal generated by the label is inevitably obscured by the particles, the level of signal generated needs to be rather high. It is surprising that the concentration of the reagent that can be attached to the particles is sufficiently high to enable a useful signal to be generated in the assay. As a rule of thumb, the magnetically attractable particles should not attenuate the signal generated by the labelled reagent thereon by more than about 90 , preferably by no more than 50 . Various assays have been described in the literature in which a labelled reagent becomes partitioned between a liquid phase and a solid phase. These involve reaction between the analyte and a specific binder for the analyte. Typical analyte specific binder combinations include antigen antibody, hapten antibody and antibody antigen. One class of assay to which this invention is particularly applicable is known as competition assay or immunoassay. In this class, the labelled reagent is the analyte or a derivative thereof coupled to a signal generating group. The specific binder is bound to the magnetically attractable particles, either before, during, or after the incubation with the assay sample. In the assay, the analyte in the assay sample and the labelled analyte derivative compete for reaction with a known amount of the solid phase specific binder. The proportion of the labelled analyte derivative that becomes bound to the solid phase is a measure of the concentration of the analyte in the sample. In this assay, it is important that the amount of solid phase specific binder be constant from one assay vessel to the next, and the use of magnetically attractable particles as carriers makes this easy to achieve. In another assay, a 2 site immunometric assay, the assay sample is incubated with excess antibody, which is either in the solid phase throughout or is insolubilised during or after incubation, whereby the analyte in the sample becomes bound to the solid phase. A labelled antibody to the analyte, or an antibody to the analyte followed by a labelled reagent for binding to the said antibody, is added to the liquid phase, and the amount of the label that becomes bound through the analyte to the solid phase is directly proportional to the concentration of analyte in the assay sample. The nature of the analyte is not critical. The invention is of use in relation to all liquid phase analytes that can be assayed by a technique which involves partition of a labelled reagent between a liquid and a solid phase. The method involves incubating the reagents, either all together or in sequence, for a time in accordance with conventional assays for the analyte. After incubation, the solid phase is brought down out of suspension and the supernatant liquid removed. The solid phase may be washed and is then re suspended in a fluid medium prior to observing a signal generated by the labelled reagent. When a microtiter plate is used, the sequence of steps may typically be as follows For measuring fluorescence or chemiluminescence, it is necessary that each well be optically screened from its neighbours. Equipment is commercially available for measuring fluorescence in the individual wells of standard opaque black microtiter plates. Depending on the chemical system used, a chemiluminescent signal may be emitted either as a short lived flash of light or as a substantially constant light emission. The following Examples illustrate the invention.
