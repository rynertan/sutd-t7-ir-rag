# Decorating substrate materials.

## Abstract
A method for decorating substrate materials such as flat metal sheet or cylindrical metal containers in which a linear polyester adhesive laminate film is applied to the substrate either prior to or simultaneously with a flexible dye transfer car rier. Thus, on heating the laminate film bonds to the substrate and dye is transferred from the carrier to the film. After cooling the carrier is removed, leaving a high gloss, finely decorated laminate film substrate.
