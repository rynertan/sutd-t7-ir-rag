# Low temperature method for making optical fibers.

## Abstract
A glass optical waveguide preform is formed by chemical reaction of gaseous and or vapourised ingredients A and B within a glass substrate tube 52 . A reactant feed tube 50 extends into a first end of the substrate tube 52 . One of the reactants A flows through the feed tube 50 , and another B flows through the annular channel between the feed 50 and substrate 52 tubes. The reactants A and B combine just downstream of the end of the feed tube 54 and react to form particulate material, of which at least a portion is deposited on the substrate tube 52 . The output end of the feed tube 50 traverses 58, 60 the substrate tube 52 so that the region of maximum soot deposition moves along the length of the substrate tube. A hot zone 54, 56 traverses 18a , 18b the substrate tube 52 in synchrony 58 with the feed tube 50 to sinter the deposited soot.
