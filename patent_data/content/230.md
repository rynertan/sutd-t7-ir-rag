# Process for the biological purification of waste water.

## Abstract
Process for the biological purification of waste water and process for the recovery of N compounds including the steps of bringing the pH of the suspension of the surplus sludge at a value of between 8 and 11 and hydrolyzing it in the presence of a volatile base at a temperature of between 90 and 300 C, which base preferably NHâ‚ƒ is removed from the hydrolysate formed after termination of the hydrolysis. N compounds can be recovered from the hydrolsate, which can also be converted to cattle feed.
