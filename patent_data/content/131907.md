# Method of reconstructing synthetic aperture radar image.

## Abstract
Azimuth compression processing is carried out by the steps of determining Doppler rate time change data 2 in a reconstructed scene from orbit data 1 of a satelite or aircraft, determining azimuth coordinates transformation data of an image after range compression 6 , that is, resampling posi tion designation data, from the Doppler rate time change data, resampling 11 the image after range compression, in the azimuth direction using the azimuth coordinates transforma tion data, keeping unaltered the Doppler rate of a point image relating to the image after coordinates transformation irresp ective to the position in the azimuth direction inside the scene, and thereafter using FFT.
