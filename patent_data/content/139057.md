# An optical vibration analyser.

## Abstract
An optical vibration anaivser in which a fibre optic probe 10, 11 collects back scattered light from a non coherent light source 15, 20 illuminating a vibrating surface 28 . The vibrating surface 28 causes near parallel light close to the probe to be scattered into the end face of the probe in proportion to its amplitude. The intensity variation is de tected by a planar diffused photo diode 16, 21 and ampli fied to a usable level. The amplitude of the back scattered light is very small in comparison with ambient light and other non correlated noise from which it is extracted. The vibrations in the observed surface are excited by a sweep oscillator 2 and the received signal is processed by a dual tracking filter 6 locked to the sweep oscillator 2 . The filtered output shows the mechanical position of the surface and vibration ampli tude and can be directly monitored.
