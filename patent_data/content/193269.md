## Description
The present invention relates to processes for preparing articles such as optical devices, bearing silica coatingsthereon. Improvement in the transmittance of light through optical devices such as windows, solar collector coverplates, lenses and prisms has long been sought so as to increase their usefulness. Optical devices havingsurfaces coated with antireflecting layers, typically having an optical thickness of one quarter of awavelength, are known. Also known are optical devices in which surface reflections are reduced by alteringthe surface to provide a gradient index of refraction between that of the medium traversed by the incidentlight, such as air and that of the body of the optical device. One method for providing such an altered surface is disclosed in Great Britain Patent No. 29,561. Itinvolves tarnishing glass surfaces in aqueous solutions of sulphuretted hydrogen in order to reduce thereflection of light therefrom. Such a method is not useful for producing an antireflection surface onpolymeric substrates. Another method for providing such an altered surface is disclosed in Nicoll U.S. Patent No. 2,445,238 .This patent discloses a method for reducing reflection from glass surfaces in which the glass is heated in avapor of hydrofluoric acid to form a skeletonized surface. Such skeletonized surfaces are difficult toreproduce and maintain. Moulton U.S. Patent No. 2,432,484 discloses a technique for forming a non gelling, nonuniformlydispersed layer of anhydrous colloidal particles on the surface of articles. The particles form a randomarrangement of peaks on the article surface to provide antireflection characteristics. Moulton U.S. Patent Nos. 2,536,764 and 2,601,123 discloses a transparent binder coating preparedusing a dilute solution of tetraethylorthosilicate in organic solvent to render the colloidal particulate layertaught in the 484 patent resistant to wiping and handling, as such layers are inherently readily susceptableto injury. Geffcken et al. U.S. Patent No. 2,366,516 disclose an antireflection layer formed by applying anaqueous dispersion of a gel like low hydrated oxide, such as silicon dioxide, to an object and heating thecoated object to a temperature of 250 C to form a hardened layer. Such a layer cannot be applied to mostpolymer substrates due to degradation of the substrate by heating to 250 C. Baker et al. U.S. Patent No. 3,301,701 disclose rendering a glass base antirefiective by coating with afinely divided silica substantially free of silica gel. Such a coating would be expected to be brittle, weak, andpowdery. Land et al. U.S. Patent No. 3,833,368 disclose antireflection coatings for photographic products whichare an eighth wave layer of a fluorinated polymer applied over an eighth wave layer of silica, the silica layerhaving been formed from an aqueous colloidal silica sol. Swerdlow U.S. Patent No. 4,409,285 discloses an antireflection coating for optical surfaces, the coatingformed from silica and or alumina particles in a polymeric binder with particles protruding from the surfaceof the binder. 20 to 98 weight percent of the particles have a size in the range of 7 to 50 nanometers nm and 5 to 65 weight percent of the particles have a size in the range of 75 to 150 nm. Yoldas U.S. Patent Nos. 4,271,210 and 4,346,131 and McCollister et al. U.S. Patent No. 4,273,826 disclose anti reflection coatings produced by coating a substrate with a metalio organic compound, e.g.alkoxide, and heating the coated substrate at temperatures which decompose the organic components ofthe coating leaving a metal oxide layer on the substrate. The temperatures necessary to decompose theorganic components would also decompose polymeric substrates. Dorer et al. U.S. Patent No. 4.190.321 disclose an antireflective coating of a metal oxide in the form ofdiscrete leaflets of varying heights and shapes. This coating is susceptible to damage during handling dueto the fragility of the leaflet structure. Cathro et al, Silica Low Reflection Coatings for Collector Covers, by a Dip Coating Process, SOLARENERGY, Vol. 32, No. 5, 1984, pp. 573 579 disclose low reflection silica coatings prepared from ethanol basedsilica sols which are aged at pH 7. Aging causes an increase in optical density and viscosity due tothe agglomeration of silica particles prior to coating. Although good adhesion of the coating to glass is saidto be obtained by heating at elevated temperatures, adhesion to polymeric substrates is poor, i.e., thecoating can be wiped from the surface of the substrate by rubbing with a tissue. The present invention is directed to a process for forming a coated article comprising coating apolymeric substrate with a solution containing 0.2 to 15 weight percent colloidal silica particles having an average primary particle size of less than 20 nm 200A , and drying said coating at a temperature of less than200 C to form apolymeric substrate having a coating of a continuous gelled network of silica particles which istransparent, provides a substantially smooth surface, is substantially uniform in thickness and is substantiallypermanently adhered to saidpolymeric substrate providing a 180 peelback value of at least 500 g cm. The coating adheres very well to polymeric substrates and canprovide such substrates with excellent average reduction in specular reflectance, e.g., at least two percent.When the polymeric substrate is transparent, the coating can provide an average increase in transmission therethroughof normal incident light in the wavelength range of 400 to 800 nm over the transmission through anuncoated substrate of the same material. The increase in transmission is preferably at least two percent andup to as much as ten percent or more. The coating can also provide antistatic properties and reducedsurface resistivity to polymeric film and sheet materials, subject to static build up. Thecoating also preferably provides abrasion resistance and slip properties to polymeric materials, such as filmand sheet materials, thereby improving their handleability. The article obtained with the process of the invention is apolymeric substrate bearing a continuous gelled network of silica particles. Theparticles have an average primary particle size of less than 20 nm 200 A . As used herein,the term continuous refers to covering the surface of the substrate with virtually no discontinuities or gapsin the areas where the gelled network is applied. The term geiled network refers to an aggregation ofcolloidal particles linked together to form a porous three dimensional network. The term porous refers tothe presence of voids between the silica particles. The term primary particle size refers to the averagesize of unagglomerated single particles of silica. The articles comprise a polymeric substrate which may be of virtually any construction,transparent to opaque, having a flat, curved, or complex shape andhave formed thereon a continuous gelled network of silica particles. When the coating is applied totransparent polymeric substrates to achieve increased light transmissivity, the coated article preferably exhibits a totalaverage increase in transmissivity of normal incident light of at least two percent and up to as much as tenpercent or more, depending on the substrate coated, over a range of wavelengths extending at leastbetween 400 to 800 nm. An increase in transmissivity can also be seen at wavelengths into the infraredportion of the spectrum. The polymeric substrates may comprise polymeric sheet, film, or molded material such as polyester,polyimide, polystyrene, polymethylmethacrylate, polycarbonate, polysulfone, polyacrylate, and celluloseacetate butyrate. Figure 1, a transmission electron micrograph of a coating 1 useful in the invention at a magnification of300.000X, shows that the coating is continuous, i.e., covers the surface of the substrate with virtually nodiscontinuities or gaps, and provides a substantially smooth surface which has only minor surfaceimperfections. Fig. 1 further shows that the coating 1 is substantially uniform in thickness. The coating is substantially permanently adhered topolymeric substrates to which it isapplied, i.e., it provides a 180 peelback value of at least about 500 g cm when tested according to amodification of ASTM Test Method D3330, generally with failure at the adhesive layer and no coatingremoval from the substrate. In the modified lest method, a 1.9 cm wide strip of Scotch Brand Magictransparent tape, available from 3M Company, is adhered to the test sample by rolling a 2 kg roller backand forth twice across the tape. The tape is then peeled from the test sample at 180 at a rate of 2 cm min. The excellent adhesion of the coating to thepolymeric substrate and the adhesive of the test tape alsodemonstrates the utility of the coating as a primer for adhering adhesives topolymeric substrates,e.g, polyester films. The gelled network provides a porous coating having voids between the silica particles. If the openporosity is too small, the properties of the coating, such as adhesion and antireflectance may be reduced. Ifthe open porosity is too large, the coating is weakened and may have reduced adhesion to the polymeric substrate.Generally, the colloidal solution from which the gelled network is obtained is capable of providing an openporosity of 25 to 70 percent, preferably 30 to 60 percent when dried. The open porosity is determined bydrying a sufficient amount of the colloidal solution to provide a dried product sample of about 50 to 100 mgand analyzing the sample using a Quantasorb surface area analyzer available from Quantachrome Corp.,Syosett, NY. The voids of the porous coating provide a multiplicity of subwavelength interstices where the index ofrefraction abruptly changes from that of air to that of the coating material. These subwavelength intersticeswhich are present throughout the coating layer, provide a coating which may have a calculated index ofrefraction of from 1.15 to 1.40, preferably 1.20 to 1.30 depending on the porosity of the coating. When theporosity of the coating is high, e.g., about 70 percent, lower values for the index of refraction are obtained.When the porosity of the coating is low, e.g., 25 percent, higher values for the index of refraction areobtained. The index of refraction of the coating is dependent on the relative volume ratios of the particlesand the interstices and the index of refraction of the silica, i.e., 1.47. For purposes of this invention, theindex of refraction RI is calculated using the formula The average primary particle size of the colloidal silica particles is less than 20 nm 200 A to achieve good adhesion of the coating to the substrate. The average primary particle size of thecolloidal silica particles is more preferably less than about 7nm 70 A when antireflection properties aresought. When the average particle size becomes too large, the resulting dried coating surface is lessefficient as an antireflection coating. The dried coating is preferably from about 20 to 500 nm thick. Such coatings provide good adhesionand antistatic properties. When the coating thickness is too great, the coating has reduced adhesion andflexibility and may flake off or form powder under mechanical stress. When antireflection properties aresought, the dried coating thickness is preferably about 70 to 250 nm, more preferably 100 to 200 nm. Articles such as transparent sheet or film materials may be coated on a single side or on both sides toincrease transmissivity, the greatest increase being achieved by coating both sides. The process of the invention comprises coating a polymeric substrate with a solution containing about 0.2 to 15weight percent colloidal silica particles having an average primary particle size less than 20 nm 200A . Preferably less than about 7 nm 70 A . and drying the coating at a temperature less than 200 C.preferably in the range of 80 to 120 C. Coating may be carried out by standard coating techniques such as bar coating, roll coating, curtaincoating, rotogravure coating, spraying and dipping. The polymeric substrate may be treated prior to coating to obtain auniform coating. Various known treatment techniques include corona discharge, flame treatment, andelectron beam. Generally, no pretreatment is required. The colloidal silica solution, e.g., a hydrosol or organosol, is applied to thepolymeric substrate of the article to becoated and dried at a temperature, less than about 200 C, preferably 80 120 C to remove water or organicdiluents. The coating may also be dried at room temperature, provided the drying time is sufficient topermit the coating to dry completely. The drying temperature should be less than that at which thesubstrate degrades. The resulting hygroscopic coating is capable of absorbing and or rehydrating water inan amount of up to about 15 to 20 weight percent, depending on ambient temperature and humidityconditions. The colloidal silica solution, finely divided solid silica particles of ultramicroscopic size in a liquid,utilized in the present invention, may be acid stabilized, sodium stabilized, or ammonia stabilized. It isgenerally helpful to acidify sodium stabilized silica sols to a pH of 3.5 to 4.0, e.g., with glacial acetic acid, toprevent particle agglomeration prior to preparation of the coating solution when alcohol is used as a diluent.Examples of commercially available colloidal silicas useful in the invention include Nalco 2326 and Nalco1034A, available from Nalco Chemical Co., and Ludox LS, available from E. I. duPont de Nemours Co., Inc. The colloidal coating solution should contain 0.2 to 15 weight percent, preferably about 0.5 to 6 weightpercent, colloidal silica particles. At particle concentrations above 15 weight percent, the resulting coating may have reduced uniformity and exhibit reduced adhesion to the polymeric substrate surface. Difficulties in obtaininga sufficiently thin coating to achieve increased light transmissivity and reduced reflection may also beencountered at concentrations above 15 weight percent. At concentrations below 0.2 weight percent,process inefficiencies result due to the large amount of solvent which must be removed and antireflectionproperties may be reduced. The thickness of the applied wet coating solution is dependent on the concentration of silica particles inthe coating solution and the desired thickness of the dried coating. The thickness of the wet coating solutionis preferably such that the resulting dried coating thickness is from 20 to 500 nm thick. The coating solution may also optionally contain a surfactant to improve wettability of the solution onthe polymeric substrate, but inclusion of an excessive amount of surfactant may reduce the adhesion properties of thecoating. Examples of suitable surfactants include Tergitol TMN 6 Union Carbide Corp. and Triton X 100 Rohm and Haas Co. . Generally, the surfactant can be used in amounts of up to about 0.5 weight percentof the solution. The coating ingredients may optionally contain a polymeric binder. Useful polymeric binders includepolyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl acetate, polyesters, polyamides, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, copolyesters, copolymersof acrylic acid and or methacrylic acid, and copolymers of styrene. The coating solution can contain up toabout 50 weight percent of the polymeric binder based on the weight of the silica particles. Useful amountsof polymeric binder are generally in the range of 0.5 to 10.0 weight percent. Addition of various adjuvants, such as slip agents and processing oils, to the substrate material mayreduce the adhesion of the coating to the polymeric substrate. The following specific, examples will serve to illustrate the invention. In these examples, all percentagesand parts are by weight unless otherwise indicated. Six grams of Nalco 2326 ammonia stabilized colloidal silica 14.5 colloidal silica as SiO The coating adhered aggressively to the substrate. A 1.9 cm 3 4 inch wide strip of Scotch BrandMagic transparent tape was applied to coated and uncoated film samples by hand pressure. A force ofabout 180 g cm tape width was required to remove the tape from the uncoated sample, while a force ofabout 530 g cm tape width was required to remove the tape from the coated sample, demonstrating aremarkable increase in the adhesion of the tape. The adhesive of the tape did not remove the coating fromthe coated film, but exhibited adhesive split of the adhesive layer leaving adhesive residue on the coatingfurther demonstrating the strong bond of the adhesive to the coated film. No adhesive split was observedwhen the tape was removed from the uncoated sample. The antireflection and transmission properties of the film were measured using an IBM UV VIS 9432Spectrophotometer at wavelengths of from 350 to 800 nm. An uncoated sample of the film was alsomeasured for comparative purposes. The results of these tests are shown in Figs. 2 and 3. As can be seenfrom Fig. 2. the reflectance of the uncoated sample. curve 2, was 12 at 600 nm, while the reflectance ofthe coated sample, curve 3, was about 2 at 600 nm. As can be seen from Fig. 3, the light transmission ofthe uncoated film, curve 4, was about 88 at 600 nm, while the light transmission of the coated sample,curve 5, was about 98 at 600 nm. This demonstrates the excellent reduction of reflectance and increasein transmission of light provided by the coating. A coating solution was prepared by diluting colloidal silica Nalco 2326 with ethanol to a concentrationof 2.5 solids and adding 0.01 Tergitol TMN 6. The solution was coated on 0.1 mm thick polyethyleneterephthalate film using a rotogravure coating roll. The coated film was dried at 93 C for three minutes. Theresulting coating was porous, continuous, and about 100 nm thick. The coating was substantially similar tothe coating shown in Fig. 1. The dried coating was observed to have good antireflection properties. Samples of the coated film as well as samples of uncoated film were tested for adhesion using themodified ASTM Test Method D3330 described hereinabove. The uncoated film had an adhesion value of189 g cm tape width with no adhesive split from the tape. The coated sample had an adhesion value of 559 g cm tape width. The tape did not remove the coating from the film, but exhibited adhesive split of theadhesive layer, again demonstrating the excellent adhesion of the coating to the substrate and the excellentadhesion of the adhesive to the coating. Various transparent polymeric sheet materials, as identified in Table 1, were coated by dipping thematerials in a coating solution containing 1.5 colloidal silica Nalco 2326 or by wiping the solution oneach side of the sheet material with a tissue wrapped glass rod and drying the coated sample. The following coating solutions were used to coat the various sheet materials For each example, the substrate material, coating method, coating solution, and drying temperature,together with the resulting light transmission determined using an IBM UV VIS 9432 Spectrophotometer atwavelengths of from 400 to 800 nm, are set forth in Table 2. Light transmission data for uncoated materialsare also set forth in Table 2 for comparative purposes. As can be seen from the data in Table 2, the coatings provide an excellent increase in lighttransmission for each of the materials which were coated. Each coated sample exhibited at least twopercent average increase in light transmission. The greatest increase in transmission was achieved on theCR 39 polycarbonate with the average percent increase in transmission for Example 7 being 6.8 percent.
