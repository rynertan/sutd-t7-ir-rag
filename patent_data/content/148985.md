# SIGNATURE HANDLING APPARATUS

## Abstract
An improved signature handling apparatus includes a plurality of signature feeders which are operatable to form groups of signatures on a conveyor. Detectors are associated with the signature feeders to detect a signature misfeed and a resulting defective group of signatures. The conveyor sequentially transports the groups of signatures to a delivery assembly which directs groups of signatures containing a predetermined number of signatures to a trimmer. The delivery assembly directs defective groups of signatures containing less than the predetermined number of signa tures to a reject tray. The delivery assembly includes a nip through which the signatures are fed from the conveyor. The size of the nip can be varied by varying the distance between rollers disposed on opposite sides of the nip. A control assembly decreases the distance between the centers of rotation of the rollers to decrease the size of the nip when a group of signatures, containing less than the predetermined number of signatures, is to be fed through the nip.
