# A XENOGENEIC EXPRESSION CONTROL SYSTEM, A METHOD OF USING IT, EXPRESSION VECTORS CONTAINING IT, CELLS TRANSFORMED THEREBY AND HETEROLOGOUS PROTEINS PRODUCED THEREFROM

## Abstract
A portable supplementary control system comprising a promoter operator operably linked to a gene encoding the desired heterologous protein plus a gene encoding a com patible supplementary repressor protein operably linked to an inducible promotor, thus remedying any deficiency of repressor provided by the host s own genome, so that expression of a gene encoding a heterologous protein is repressed until a favourable point in the growth cycle of the host. The control system offers a method whereby heterolo gous protein production can be regulated by manipulation of the environment or of the medium.
