# Method and composition of inhibiting corrosion and deposition in aqueous systems.

## Abstract
Composition for inhibiting corrosion and scale deposi tion on metallic surfaces in contact with an aqueous system comprising 1 an effective amount of a water soluble zinc com pound adapted to liberate ZnÂ² ions in solution, 2 an effective amount of a water soluble cellulose gum and 3 an effective amount of organo phosphorus acid compound or water soluble salt thereof and a method of treating cooling water systems of the type prone to scale formation on, and corrosion of, metallic parts in contact with the water system comprising the step of adding to the cooling water system an effective amount of such a composition.
