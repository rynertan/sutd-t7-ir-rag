## Description
Method for the biological purification of contaminated gases The invention relates to a method for the biological purification of contaminated gases containing contaminants which are not or hardly water soluble by means of one or more types of microorganism. From Chem. Ing. Tech. 56 1984 No. 4, pages 279 286 it is known that many types of microorganism are capable of converting numerous undesired components in air such as, in particular, intensely malodorous substances, into un objectionable products. In view of the fact that the ac tivity of organisms of this type is associated with water, such substances need to be transferred from the gas phase to the aqueous medium of the microorganism. For the aero bic microbial conversion described in the said literature reference, apart from water, oxygen must additionalLy be present. As technical embodiments for the biological puri fication of, for example, waste gases from agricuLture or industry respectively, the biofilter devices and also the biowashing devices are particularly mentioned. A biofilter may be depicted by Figure 1 in which 1 represents an inlet pipe for contaminated air, 2 a humidifying device for the contaminated air, 3 a spray device, 4 a pipe for the humidified contaminated air, 5 a pressure chamber or gravel bed, 6 a filter bed, for example of compost and or peat, and 7 an out let for the purified air. Apart from the advantages of a biofilter such as low running costs and a simple construc tion of the system, this system has a number of disadvantages such as large dimensions and a limited surface load ing. In particular, biofilters normally have a large area, for example of 300 1,200 m2 and a thickness of approximately 0.5 1 metre. The low surface loading of a biofilter is associated with the fall in pressure through the filter bed which because of energy costs should not be more than 100 200 mm of water column.Because of this the surface loading of the modern compost filters is approximately 100 m3 m2 hour. By using compost compounded in a special manner the surface loading can be increased by a factor of 3 5. To eliminate one of the disadvantages connected with the biofilters, in particular the bulkiness thereof, the biowash device has been developed. A device of this type may be represented byFigure 2 in which 8 represents a wash column, 9 an inlet pipe for contaminated air, 10 an outlet pipe for the purified air, 11 a pipe for the water loaded with contaminants, 12 an aeration vessel with an air inlet pipe 13 or outlet pipe 13a respectively and 14 a pipe for purified water. A system of this type has, however, also disadvantages such as the occurrence of contamination of the packing in the wash column 8 by microorganisms, while at the same time the stability of the microorganisms in a system of this type leaves something to be desired.In addition, in the wash column 8 employing water only a limited rate of mass transfer is attained for numerous organic compounds such as toluene. Because of this the size of the wash column and also the rate of flow of the washing liquid should be considerable. Further from German Offenlegungsschrift 3,227,375 a method is known for the purification of waste gases containing biologically degradable contaminants, which are slightly water soluble. These contaminants are absorbed by a suspension of active sludge in water and broken down aerobically by microorganisms in the active sludge present in a vessel. For increasing the absorption capacity or achieving a buffer capacity for peak loads 0.2 10 g of active charcoal per liter is added to the active sludge suspension after which the contaminants absorbed in the sludge or on active charcoal respectively are degraded aerobically. However, according to the method known from said German Offenlegungsschrift 3,227,375 the amount of contaminants to be adsorbed is limited to a maximum of a few grams per liter.This means that at very discontinuous emissions, for instance at the storage and transhipping of chemicals in tanks, a very large reservoir of active sludge is necessary. This also means that an optional anaerobical treatment is not considered applicable on account of the necessary heating to the optimum temperature of about 350C. Further this also means that especially for an anaerobical conversion the danger of poisoning the microorganisms because of concentrations of dissolved, non absorbed compounds, being too high, can be considered a threat for the stability of the purification method. It has been found that the disadvantages associated with the systems discussed above can be completely or largely eliminated if, in a first stage, the contaminated gas is brought into contact with an aqueous suspension containing 2 40 z by weight of a biologically inert carrier material as sorbent which is optionally loaded with one or more types of microorganism, whereafter, in a second stage, the contaminants absorbed on the carrier material are broken down anaerobically, optionally preceded or followed by an aerobic fermentation. The advantages of the system according to the invention comprising the anaerobical purification stage are the smaller sludge production and the decreased need for nutrients in respect to aerobical systems. Further there is hardly any need for energy necessary for stirring etc. in the anaerobical purification of aqueous sludges, this contrary to aerobical systems. A further ad vantage in a number of cases is the production of methane. Another advantage of the invention is that the large amount of carrier material has a stabilising action on the microorganisms. Because of the open bed structure of the first stage of the method according to the invention, it can be constructed in a compact manner from the technical point of view. Because of the low drop in pressure and the rapid mass transfer a surface loading of, for example, 5,000 10,000 m3 m2 hour can in principle be attained. The second stage of the method according to the invention is a bioreactor in which the suspension loaded with contaminants is purified anaerobically. This stage can be preceded or followed by an aerobical stage. As an example of such a combination an aerobic conversion of NH3 into NO3 and subsequently an anaerobic conversion of the NO3 obtained into N2 may be mentioned. Like the first stage, the second stage of the method according to the invention can also be constructed in a compact manner. Thus, in the aerobic purification, if used, the per centage of space taken up by air in the device according to the invention is much lower than in a biofilter known from the prior art a few per cent against 50 . In addition, in the case of the invention, the quantity of inert material is small compared with the known biofilters.At the same time, a smaller floor area can be achieved because a greater installation height is possible. In a biofilter this is not achievable because the pressure drop through the filter rises too high and because of the resulting energy consumption. With discontinuous emissions it is possible by using adsorbents to make do with a smaller biological reactor. For an emission duration of, for example, two hours per day, the biological reactor may be dimensioned twelve times smaller because outside the emission period the compounds stored in the adsorbents can be broken down further. From the above it follows that the appliance necessary for the carrying out of the method according to the invention can be constructed from equipment common in the processing industry. As a result of this the biological purification according to the invention can be fitted into already existing industrial processing systems in a simple manner. Moreover, the invention has the advantage that specific microorganisms can be used so that it is possible to load carrier material with the said microorganism or microorganisms which give optimum results for a certain conversion. At the same time in organic compounds can be used as nutrients for the microorganisms concerned. The method according to the invention can be carried out in a device according to Figure 3. In this device 15 represents a wash appliance, 16 an inlet pipe for contaminated air, 17 an outlet pipe for the purified air, 18 an inlet pipe for the suspension of carrier optionally loaded with a microorganism, 19 an outlet pipe for the suspension of the carrier optionally loaded with a microorganism, 20 a biological reactor or reactor system and 21 a waste pipe. Via the waste pipe 21 a portion of the liquid is periodically released in order to prevent poisoning by accumulation of breakdown products.More particularly, the washappliance 15 can be constructed in the form of, for example, a packed column for example very open with a channel type packing or as a turbulence washing device. With regard to the biological reactor 20 it is emphasised that the latter can be operated both aerobically and anaerobically, and in addition, if required, may consist of several separate stages for the breakdown of various compounds which takes place under different conditions. A preferred embodiment of the device shown inFigure 3 is depicted in Figure 4. In the said Figure 4 15 to 20 incl. have the meanings stated in the discussion of Figure 3, and 22 represents a connecting pipe between reactor 20 and a separating device 23 , 24 a return pipe from the separating device 23 to the reactor 20 and 25 a waste pipe. The separating device 23 is, for example, a settling tank or, advantageously, a hydrocyclone system from which a carrier optionally loaded with microorganisms is removed via pipe 18 and fluid with optionally loose microorganisms via pipe 24 . As examples of inert carrier materials to be used in the method according to the invention mention may be made of the inert carrier materials known from the prior art such as types of active charcoal, silica, alumina, zeoCites, molecular sieves, metal oxides, sand and oorous glass. The carrier materials are used, for example, in a quantity of 2 G referred to the suspension. The choice of the microorganisms in the method according to the invention is, on the one hand, dependent on the prevailing conditions, i.e. anaerobic or aerobic conditions, and on the other hand, on the desired reaction.More particularly, the following microorganisms may be used under anaerobic conditions Aerobacter hydrogenomonas, varieties of Clostridium, varieties of Methanospirillum, varieties of Methanobacter and varieties of Alkal genes. Under aerobic conditions, for the breakdown of hydrocarbons various varieties of Pseudomonas and Artrobacter and moulds may be used, for the breakdown of sulphur compounds such as H2S and mercaptans varieties of Thiobacillus, such as Thiobacillus thiioxidans and Thiobacillus thioparus, for the breakdown of nitrogen compounds such as NH3 and amines varieties of Nitrobacter andNitrosomonas, and for the breakdown of chlorinated hydrocarbons, for example, varieties of Pseudomonas,Arthrobacter, Acinetobacter, Rhodotorula and Aspergillus.Often the carrier should be inoculated with a complex mixture of microorganisms such as active sludge from an aerobic or anaerobic water purification plant, percolation water from composting processes, biomass from the sludge fermentation of sewage water purification plants and or extracts from methanogenic sediments. Examples of waste gases to be purified are air loaded with in organic contaminants, for example originating from intensive livestock breeding, and also industrial waste gases which are contaminated, for example, with hydrocarbons such as toluene and the like. Another example of a gas to be puri fied is fermentation gas which contains, for example, 0.12 of H2S. On burning an H2S containing fermentation gas of this type corrosion problems, in particular, occur in the combustion equipment. In the method according to the invention a pH buffer is preferably used. For example, gases which are contaminated with nitrogen containing compounds are advantageously treated at a pH of 7 9 and gases which contain sulphur containing contaminants advantageously at a pH of 2 4. Since microorganisms are sensitive to toxic components in the contaminated gas it is advisable in such a case to subject the gases to be purified to a chemical pretreatment. For example, an excessive concentration of aldehydes may have a toxic effect on the microorganisms so that a mild chemical oxidation of the aldehydes to the corresponding acids is used with advantage. If the purification according to the invention is only carried out anaerobically the microorganism used for the purification should, as a rule, be provided with a nutrient such as nitrate. For example, a nitrate addition of this type is used in the anaerobic purification of H2S containing fermentation gas, in which the following reaction occurs 8No3 5H2S H2S04 4N2 4S042 4H20 The last named reaction can be carried out by a number of microorganisms such as Thiobacillus denitrificans and Thiomicrospira denitrificans. For the sake of completeness it is emphasised with respect to this last named reaction that the H2S04 obtained can be neutralised by means of a base such as NgC03, CaCO3 or Ca OR 2. Moreover, the invention relates to a method for the biological purification of a contaminated gas by means of one or more varieties of microorganism, in which the gas to be purified contains one or more gaseous nitrogen compounds as contaminant. The purification of gases with gaseous nitrogen compounds such as NH3 in them is known, for example, from intensive livestock breeding. The said NH3 can be converted into N03 nitrate by means of, for example, biofilters.The disadvantage of the classical operation is, however, that the N03 is released in large quantities of water, which water then has to be discharged and therefore causes environmental contamination. It has been found that the biological purification of gases can be carried out in a more efficient manner if the gas to be purified contains at least one or more NOx gases as contaminant, x having a value of 0.5 2.5. Because of the conversion of the NOx gases into the nitrate, the contaminant NOx can be removed at the same time, for example from flue gases, the waste gases of nitric acid factories or the gases extracted above pickling baths provided with nitric acid. The NOx content of the gases to be purified is, for example, 10 1000 ppm. This last named method can be applied by using many types of purification device such as biofilters, biowashers and devices based on suspensions of carrier material optionally loaded with microorganisms. Since in the conversion of NOx and other nitrogencontaining compounds according to the invention fairly concentrated nitrate solutions are obtained, the waste water from biofilters and the like has a considerable biological nutritional value. Here the quantity of nitrate may rise to 50 100 gram of nitrate litre of waste water. In this connection it is surprising that the microorganisms present on the carrier material do not die off. Through an optimisation of the method according to the invention, such as a critical moisture control and the use of the waste water to humidify the gas to be purified or the carrier material respectively, the concentration of nitrate in the waste water can be increased further. The purification method according to the invention based on the use of NOx gases can be used in many fields.By the addition of flue gas to a waste gas stream to be purified the nitrate N03 is, as already mentioned, formed from the NOx, which leads, for example, in the case of gases contaminated with hydrocarbons to an increased hydrocarbon consumption or breakdown. A specific application of the last named method according to the invention consists in a biological purification system in respect of the purification and combustion of fermentation gas. More particularly, this specific method can be clarified by reference to Figure 5, in which 27 represents an inlet pipe for fermentation gas, 26 a reactor, 28 a pipe for purified fermentation gas, 29 a combustion device for the fermentation gas, 30 a pipe for flue gases, 31 a reactor for the purification of the flue gases, 32 an outlet pipe for the purified flue gases, 33 a pipe for the supply of water, 34 an outlet pipe for the nitrate solution obtained in the second reactor vessel and 35 a waste pipe from the first reactor. The quantity of nitrate formed in reactor 31 can also be controlled by adjustment of the combustion device 29 . In the first reactor of Figure 5 an anaerobic conversion takes place of the H2S present in the fermentation gas according to the reaction below 8N03 SH2S H2SO4 4N2 4S042 4H20The H2S04 obtained in this reactor is neutralised with a base such as CaC03 or Ca OH 2. The purified fermentation gas originating from the first reactor is subsequently burnt in a combustion device 29 . During this combustion flue gases are released which contain N0x. These flue gases, diluted or undiluted, are treated aerobically in asecond reactor 31 , the NO, being converted into N03 nitrate . Apart from purified flue gases, the nitrate formed is removed from this second reactor 31 , which nitrate can be used in the first reactor for the anaerobic conversion of H2S which takes place therein. As microorganisms which can be used for the anaerobic conversion Of H2S, mention may be made of Thiobacillus denitrificans and Thiomicrospira denitrificans. As microorganisms which are suitable for the conversion of NO, into N03 mention may be made of varieties of Nitrosomonas. The invention is explained in more detail by reference to the examples below, which should not, however, be interpreted as restrictive.Example I During an operating time of 2,000 hours year 120,000 ,3 hour Of waSte gas with a toluene content of 330 mg m3 and a temperature of 200C was removed from a factory plant and fed to a device according to the invention. The device according to the invention consisted, as shown in Figure 3, of a wash column 15 having a floor area of 30 m2 and a height of 1 m. Water containing 15 by weight of active charcoal was used as suspension. The active charcoal was loaded with microorganisms by impregnation with percolation water from composted domestic refuse. The liquid gas ratio in the wash column 15 was 2 kg kg. The suspension loaded with contaminant was then fed to a bioreactor 20 which had a capacity of 60 m3 2 vessel having a base area of 30 m and a height of 2 m . As a result of the biological breakdown occurring in the bioreactor a removal efficiency of 75 95 was obtained. The above device according to the invention occupied a floor area of 30 m2 and had a height of approx. 5 m. On comparing the dimensions of the device according to the invention described above with those of a biofilter known from the prior art having a layer thickness of 1 m which, with a surface loading of 300 m3 m2 hourshould have a area of 400 m2 for the processing of 120,000 m3 hour, it can be deduced that the device according to the invention occupies a considerably smaller floor area 30 m2 as against approx. 400 m2 . To illustrate the breakdown or the beneficial effect of NOx gases respectively on the operation of bioreactors a few examples are mentioned below which should not, however, be interpreted as restrictive.Example II A pilot plant biofilter with compost as biologically active filling material in a layer thickness of 1 m was used for the purification of gas which was loaded with 60 ppm of NOx. The filling material was at the same time buffered to a pH of 7 9 by addition of lime CaC03 .The gas contaminated with NOx was passed through with a surface loading of as much as 400 m3 m2 hour. Despite this a removal efficiency of 80 95 was nevertheless achieved.Example III A pilot plant biofilter with a tree bark compost mixture as biologically active filling material was used for the purification of gas which was loaded with 330 mg of toluene m3. The contaminated gas was passed through with a surface loading of 300 m3 m2 hour. Without effecting a nitrate addition or NOx supplementation, the toluene removal efficiency was less than 10 . However, with an NOx supplementation of 10 20 mgNOx m3 the toluene removal efficiency increased to over 90 . On using flue gas as NOx source, only 1 5 of flue gas referred to the toluene containing gas had to be added to the gas to be purified.Example IV In this example the device according to Figure 5 was used. Fermentation gas containing 0.25 by volume of HZS and having a temperature of 200C was fed via pipe 27 through a biofilter 26 in which there was a bed ofThiobacillus denitrificans on active charcoal The rate of flow of the fermentation gas was 20 m3ihour and the volume of the biofilter was 2 m3. The HZS removal efficiency was 95 99 . The fermentation gas purified in this manner was then fed via pipe 28 to a combustion device 29 and burnt, a flue gas flow of 200 m3 hour with an NOx content of 500 ppm being obtained via pipe 30 . After cooling, humidification and dilution 2 5 times with ambient air, the waste gas obtained was fed through a second biofilter 31 . This second filter was filled with a tree bark compost mixture and had a floor area of 2,5 m2 and a height of 2 m. The waste water from the second biofilter 31 was periodically sprayed via pipe 34 in a quantity of 50100 litre day over the bed of the first biofilter 26 , the nitrate present in the said waste water then being used in the first biofilter as nutrient for the microorganismThiobacillus denitrificans present therein. By means of the method described in this example it is possible to achieve a continuous purification process for fermentation gas or a continuous conversion of NOx gases into nitrate respectively, which nitrate may serve as nutrient in the anaerobic purification process for the fermentation gas.
