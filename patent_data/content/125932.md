# Control apparatus for and method of operating automatic filling machine.

## Abstract
A control apparatus fore filling machine of the type emp loying a hopper 12 and rotary feed auger 18 determines the exact number of auger revolutions required to deliver a pre selected weight of material 16 to be dispensed by weighing the volume of material delivered by a given number of auger revolutions and computing the ratio of the number of auger revolutions to the weight of the volume delivered. The ratio is then divided into the desired weight to determine the actual number of auger revolutions required to deliver the desired weight. The control apparatus also measures the amount of rotation of the rotary auger 18 after the auger is braked at the end of each fill cycle and increments or decrements a pre selected set point number of auger revolutions, depending upon whether the actual number of auger revolutions is grea ter than or less than the set point, to compensate for auger rotation after braking.
