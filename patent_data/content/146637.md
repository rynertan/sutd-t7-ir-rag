# METHOD OF DETECTING ERROR.

## Abstract
Each of the data words D is formed of a digital signal of a predetermined number of bits. A predetermined consecu tive number of the data words D on a recording or transfer medium are combined to form a data block. When decoding a data signal provided with an error inspection symbol P in accordance with a sequence within a data block and another error inspection symbol Q in accordance with a sequence which is different from the sequence within the data block, all erroneous data words detected by the other error inspection symbol Q are judged to be erroneous. The method makes it possible to reliably detect any erroneous data word.
