On both sides of the base line of the sealing fin 10 parallel tearing perforation lines 6 located opposite one another are provided which at a point on the top side of the triangular lug 15 converge uniformly in an arcshaped manner so as to extend over the lateral edges 13 of the triangular lug 15 and converging on the underside of the triangular lug 15 without the said tearing perforation 6, 6 having any breaks or point of discontinuity other than those arising in connection with the perforation 6 passing over the lateral edge 13 of the triangular lug 15 .
