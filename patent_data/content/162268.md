# Position speed detection method and apparatus.

## Abstract
A position speed detection method and apparatus em ploying an encoder mounted on the rotary shaft of a motor in order to control the position and speed, wherein the coarse position Pc K and fine position are simultaneously de tected by an encoder pulse and an encoder original signal A,B , respectively and the detected results are combined to detect the position and speed of the motor with high preci sion.
