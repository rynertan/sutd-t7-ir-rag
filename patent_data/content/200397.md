## Description
This invention relates to amine epoxide reaction products and to aqueous dispersions thereof which may be used in coating compositions suitable for application to a substrate by electrodeposition. It is known that aqueous dispersions of ionisable salts of certain amine epoxide reaction products are useful in coating compositions which are to be applied to a cathodic substrate by electrodeposition. Typical ionisable salts of reaction products of this type and of aqueous dispersions thereof which are useful in coating compositions to be used in an electrodeposition process are described in U.S. Patent No. 4,064,090. Reaction products of this general type are particularly useful in cathodic electrodeposition processes since, in general, they impart to a cured coating on a substrate a good resistance to corrosion which is a characteristic of the epoxide resins and the amine nitrogen atoms provide a suitable site for the cationic charge necessary for cathodic deposition. In addition they usually contain groups, for example hydroxyl groups, which are reactive with a crosslinking agent which also can be present in the coating composition which is to be applied to a substrate by electrodeposition. It is also known, for example from European Patent Publication No. 070,550 and from U.S. Patent No. 3,963,663 that polyoxyalkylene polyamines are useful as an amine reactant in this type of amine epoxide reaction product since they improve the flexibility of the final coating. In both of these publications the epoxide reactant has an average 1,2 epoxy functionality greater than 1.0. We have now found that improved reaction products of the amine epoxide type, which are particularly useful in coating compositions to be applied to a substrate by a cathodic electrodeposition process, can be prepared by coreacting a polyepoxide, a polyoxyalkylene polyamine, a secondary amine and, optionally, a monoepoxide. The improvements relate in particular to the corrosion resistance and other properties of the final coating film and to the properties of application, for example the emulsion stability and throwing power of the aqueous dispersion. According to this invention we provide a non gelled amine epoxide reaction product which is obtained by coreacting The coreactants may be reacted in a single stage one or two more of the coreactants may be reacted in a first stage to give an intermediate product, followed by a further reaction stage or stages in which the remaining coreactants are reacted with the preformed intermediate reaction product. The proportions of the polyfunctional reactants B and C are selected, taking into account the proportion of the monofunctional reactant A and, the proportion of the optional monofunctional reactant D, such that the final reaction product is not gelled. Preferably the polyepoxide has a 1,2 epoxide functionality of from 1.1 to 2.0 more preferably 1.3 to 2.0 and still more preferably 1.4 to 1.8. If the 1,2 epoxide functionality of the polyepoxide is significantly greater than 2.0 then there is a risk of gelation. Examples of suitable polyepoxides include the polyglycidyl ethers of cyclic polyols of epoxide equivalent in the range 150 2500, preferably in the range 200 2000, more preferably in the range 400 1000. Specific examples of suitable polyepoxides include those prepared by the etherification of a poly phenol with epichlorhydrin in the presence of an alkali. The polyphenol may be for example bis 4 hydroxyphenyl 2,2 propane. Suitable polyepoxides include those which are commercially available from Shell Chemicals under the Registered Trade Mark Epikote , for example Epikote 1001, 1004 and 1007. Polyepoxides of lower molecular weight may be chain extended to provide polyepoxides of higher molecular weight, for example by reaction with bisphenol. Other suitable polyepoxides include the diglycidyl ethers of polypropylene glycol, for example those having an epoxide equivalent in the range 150 350. Polyepoxides of this type are commercially available from Dow Chemicals as DER 732 and 736. Suitable polyepoxides also include those in which the 1,2 epoxy functionality of a precursor has been reduced by reaction of a proportion of epoxide groups with a capping or terminating agent, for example a phenol or a monocarboxylic acid. Suitable phenols include phenol, alkylated phenols such as cresol, nonyl phenol and The polyoxyalkylene polyamine is preferably a diamine or a triamine, or more preferably a triamine. Preferably the amino groups are primary amino groups which each contain two reactive hydrogen atoms wherein the second reactive hydrogen atom is much less reactive than the first reactive hydrogen atom after the first reactive hydrogen atom has been reacted with an epoxide. Mixtures of diamines and triamines may be used. A diamine may have a functionality of up to 4. A triamine may have a functionality of up to 6. However, in view of the foregoing preferment as to reactivity of the amino hydrogen atoms, preferably they have effective functionalities of 2 and 3 respectively. In one preferred type of reaction product the functionality of the polyoxyalkylene polyamine is reduced by reaction with the optional monoepoxide D before it is reacted with the polyepoxide B . Preferably the effective functionality of the polyamine is reduced in this way to not less than 1.5. One preferred polyoxyalkylene polyamine is a diamine of structure Another preferred polyoxyalkylene polyamine is a triamine which has the general structure One suitable such triamine is commercially available as Jeffamine T 403 where a b c 5.3 approx. ,x CH₃. The polyoxyalkylene polyamine is preferably of average molecular weight in the range 150 4000, more preferably in the range 200 2000. It may be preferred to reduce the proportion of polyoxyalkylene polyamine which is used for example by replacing some of it with a monoprimary amine which has reactive hydrogen atoms each readily reactive with an epoxide group. This primary amine thus fulfills an epoxide bridging function of the replaced polyamine. Suitable monoprimary amines include, for example, ethanolamine, butylamine and long chain fatty amines such as the amine obtained by the reduction of the amide of coconut oil fatty acid. The monoprimary amine may also contain within its structure a tertiary amino group, for example it may be dimethylamino propylamine, diethylamino propylamine, N aminopropyldiethanolamine or N aminopropyl morpholine. As previously mentioned, according to one aspect of the invention it is preferred to react the polyoxyalkylene polyamine C with at least a proportion of the optional monoepoxide D before the polyoxyalkylene polyamine is reacted with the remaining reactants. However, according to another preferred aspect of the invention, satisfactory reaction products can be obtained when the same proportions of reactants as are used in such a preferred process are all coreacted in a single stage. According to a further preferred aspect of the invention the monoepoxide is excluded as a co reactant. In general the amount of the optional monoepoxide D which is used depends upon two requirements, a the stability of the emulsion which is obtained from the final reaction product after it is treated with acid and emulsified in water and b the requirement to leave for reaction with the polyepoxide on average at least one reactive amino hydrogen atom per molecule of diamine or triamine and preferably to leave in the final product, i.e. even after reaction with the polyepoxide, some secondary amino groups. Particularly suitable monoepoxides are the glycidyl esters of carboxylic acids, for example the glycidyl ester of an acid in which the carboxyl group is attached to a tertiary C₈ alkyl group commercially available as Cardura E from Shell Chemicals . Other suitable monoepoxides are glycidyl ethers, for example alkyl glycidyl ether optionally substituted where the alkyl group may be for example butyl or hexyl, or aryl glycidyl ethers optionally substituted for example phenyl glycidyl ether. The optional intermediate product which is obtained by reacting the polyoxyalkylene polyamine C with the monoepoxide D according to the above mentioned one preferred aspect of the process, is preferably reacted in a further single stage with the remaining reactants, the polyepoxide B and the secondary amine A . Alternatively the reaction with the polyepoxide and the secondary amine may be carried out in separate stages. Suitable secondary amines A include dialkylamines, for example diethylamine and diisopropylamine substituted dialkylamines, for example the preferred hydroxyalkylamines such as diethanolamine, N methylethanol amine and diisopropanolamine and cycloaliphatic amines, for example hydroxyethylpiperazine, morpholine and N methylpiperazine. When defining the relative proportions of the reactant components which are preferably used in preparing the amine epoxide reaction product of this invention it is convenient to refer to the relative molar proportions of the reacting functional groups which are present in each reactant T, A, B, C and D where T denotes the capping or terminating agent used with the polyepoxide and these can be expressed as the following ratio, T monofunctional terminating group B polyfunctional epoxide groups in a polyepoxide Preferably the reactants are used in the following ratio ranges 0 2 2 6 1.5 3.5 0 2 0.25 1.5 more preferably in the ratio ranges 0.5 1.5 3 5 2 3 0 1 0.5 1.5. When, as described above, a portion of the polyoxyalkylene amine is replaced by a primary amine, the ratio range of the polyoxyalkylene amine is reduced to 1.0 3.0 and there is used a relative molar proportion of up to 1 of the primary amine. Clearly the amine epoxide reaction products obtained by the process of this invention will comprise a complex mixture of components, and the nature of the mixture will depend for example upon the relative proportions of the reactants. We believe, but without limitation, that certain components are beneficial in a reaction product which is to be employed as its ionisable salt in aqueous dispersion in a coating composition for application by a process of electrodeposition. For example we believe that when C is a diamine structures A B C D and A B A where A ,B ,C and D represent the residues of the reactants A,B,C and D respectively may be beneficial in certain respects. When C is a triamine and there is also used a capping or terminating agent T it is believed that A B C B T or A B B T may be useful structures where A ,B ,C ,D and T , represent the residues of the reactants A,B,C,D and T respectively . Any of the stages for reacting A,B,C and optionally D and or T may be carried out in inert organic solvent, at temperatures of 50 200 C, preferably 75 150 C. Suitable such solvents include methyl isobutylketone, Cellosolve acetate, ethyl butyl Cellosolve and toluene. In general it is desirable to add the secondary amine to the polyepoxide Preferably the final amine epoxide reaction product has an amine value of 0.5 2.0 millimoles g and an epoxide value of approximately zero. Aqueous dispersions of the amine epoxide reaction product may be prepared by adding water and a suitable neutralising acid, for example an inorganic acid such as phosphoric acid or an organic acid such as acetic acid or lactic acid, to the above final product preferably distilling off the volatile organic solvent which is present and then emulsifying under conditions of high shear. The invention thus provides also an aqueous dispersion of an ionisable acid salt of a non gelled amine epoxide reaction product prepared as herein described. In addition to the ionised acid salt of the amine epoxide reaction product other materials which may be present also in the above aqueous dispersion when used as a coating composition include, for example, a crosslinking agent for the amine epoxide reaction product, for example a capped or blocked poly isocyanate, a β hydroxyester of the type described in EP O 040 867, or phenol , melamine , benzoguanamine , glycoluril , or urea formaldehyde resins catalysts, for example for the crosslinking reaction surfactants pigments coalescing solvent, and any other material which is conventionally present in aqueous coating compositions. Thus the present invention also provides a coating composition which comprises an aqeuous dispersion of an ionisable acid salt of the amine epoxide reaction product prepared as herein described together with a crosslinking agent. The coating composition is particularly suitable for application to a conductive substrate by electrodeposition and the invention also provides a process of coating by electrodeposition a conductive substrate, immersed as a cathode in the composition, by passing an electric current between the substrate and a counter electrode. In addition to the materials mentioned above as possible components of a coating composition according to this invention, there may also be present organic film forming components, usually polymeric components, in addition to the amine epoxide reaction product. Preferably there is present in the aqueous dispersion of a coating composition derived therefrom at least 50 by weight of the amine epoxide reaction product based on the total organic film forming components, but in addition to any crosslinking agent which is mentioned above there may be present other film forming components for example acrylic or vinyl polymers, alkyd resins, polyesters and polurethanes. These further components preferably contain groups which are crosslinkable, for example hydroxyl groups, and these groups are preferably reactive with the crosslinking agent, for example a blocked polyisocyanate, present to crosslink the amine epoxide reaction product. These further organic, preferably polymeric, components may be present to improve or modify the characteristics of the coating film obtained from a coating composition. For example, when the coating compositions are applied to a substrate by electrodeposition it may be necessary to add suitable components to improve adhesion between the elecrodeposited film and the substrate or a subsequently applied coating to minimise the formation of craters in the coating to improve the throwing power of the composition or to increase the film thickness. Certain hydroxyl group containing acrylic copolymers have been found useful in certain of these respects, for example a hydroxybutyl acrylate butylacrylate copolymer. The process of applying by electrodeposition the coating compositions of this invention is in general conventional. In addition to their use as a primary film forming component of the coating compositions of this invention the amine epoxide reaction products may also be useful as pigment dispersants in these or similar coating compositions. In such a case the amine epoxide reaction product may be used to disperse a pigment or mixture of pigments, extenders and the like in an aqueous medium before being combined with a primary film forming component of the coating composition. The amount of the amine epoxide reaction product which is used in this preliminary pigment dispersion step in aqueous medium may be in the range 1 60 , preferably 4 40 , by weight based on total solids weight of the preliminary dispersion. The amount of pigment present in the preliminary dispersion may be in the range 10 80 , preferably 15 70 by weight based on the total solids weight of the preliminary dispersion. The invention is illustrated by the following Examples in which parts and percentages are by weight. This Example illustrates the preparation of an epoxide amine reaction product according to the invention by a process in which a polyoxyalkylene diamine is first reacted with a monoepoxide in equimolar proportions and the reaction product then reacted with a polyepoxide and a secondary amine in the molar ratio 5 4 3 respectively. The Example also illustrates the preparation of a stable aqueous dispersion of the reaction product and the use of this dispersion in a pigmented coating composition to coat a metallic article by electrodeposition. The resulting emulsion was stirred and heated under inert gas to remove water and methyl isobutyl ketone, and any other volatile organic solvent present. The water removed was subsequently replaced, and after filtration the resulting dispersion was diluted to 20 solids. A conventional pigment millbase containing a tin catalyst was then added to produce a coating composition. A phosphated steel panel as cathode was coated by electrodeposition at 350 volts for 2 minutes using the above coating composition at a bath temperature of 27 C. The composition had a pH of 5.6 and a conductivity of 1650 µs ccm ¹. The panel was removed, rinsed with demineralised water and stoved at 180 C for 20 minutes. A smooth corrosion resistant coating film was produced which had good mechanical properties when subjected to stone chip, bending and impact tests. This Example illustrates the preparation of three epoxide amine reaction products by the procedure of Example 1 the molecular weight of the polyepoxide resin being different in each case. The polyoxyalkylene diamine monoepoxide adduct used in each case is the same as that described in Example 1 a . The three epoxide amine reaction products were prepared according to the method in Example 1 b using the following ingredients in parts by weight The three resulting final reaction products 1, 2, and 3 were made up into corresponding aqueous dispersions 1 , 2 3 by the procedure of Example 1 c using the following formulations parts by weight The dispersion 1 was fine but some coagulant was formed during the solvent stripping stage. The dispersion 2 was very fine and no coagulant was formed during the stripping stage. The dispersion 3 was coarse and totally coagulated during stripping. Thus the diepoxide resin of epoxide equivalent 475 was unsuitable in this type of preparation. The filtered dispersion 1 and the unfiltered dispersion 2 were made up into coating compositions as described in Example 1 c . They had the following parameters Coating films were deposited during 2 minutes on phosphated steel panels by electrodeposition at 380 volts. Smooth, corrosion resistant films were obtained after baking at 180 C for 20 minutes. This Example illustrates the preparation of an epoxide amine reaction product using an alternative polyoxyalkylene diamine, bis 3 aminopropyl polytetra hydrofuran of molecular weight 750. This Example illustrates the preparation of an epoxide amine reaction product using a mixture of poly oxyalkylene diamines, their average molecular weight being higher than that of the diamine used in Example 1. This Example illustrates the preparation of two epoxide amine reaction products in which there is used either an alternative monoepoxide or an alternative secondary amine. This Example illustrates the preparation of epoxide amine reaction products using three different molar proportions of the monoepoxide D. This Example illustrates the effect of altering the relative amounts of the secondary amine and of the polyoxyalkylene diamine monoepoxide adduct in order to increase that amount of the final product which does not contain a polyoxyalkylene diamine residue or a monoepoxide residue. This Example illustrates the preparation of a resin, similar to that prepared in Example 1, but by a single stage process rather than by the two stage process used in the previous Example. This Example illustrates the use of an alternative cross linking agent. a Films deposited onto phosphated steel panels were smooth and well cured after stoving at 180 C for 30 minutes. This Example illustrates the preparation of pigmented coating compositions similar to that described in Example 1 but in which the acrylic copolymer was either omitted or replaced by a different copolymer. The procedure and formulation of EXample 1 c was followed in two further preparations except that the acrylic polymer there described The resulting paint had the bath constants This Example illustrates the preparation of an aqueous dispersion similar to that of Example 1 but in which the acrylic polymer was prepared After emulsification the acrylic monomers were polymerised by adding a solution of 1 part of ascorbic acid, 0.25 part of ferrous sulphate in 70 parts of water to the emulsion. The mixture was stirred gently overnight after which time the polymerisation was complete. The resulting emulsion was stripped of volatile organic solvents and made into a coating composition. The bath constants compared with those from Example 1 were This Example illustrates the use of the resins of this invention as aqueous pigment dispersants. This Example illustrates the preparation of an amine epoxide reaction product from co reactants A, B, C and D and its use in a coating composition. A polyepoxide is prepared from intermediates and is reduced in 1,2 epoxy functionality by reaction This Example illustrates the preparation of an amine epoxide reaction product from co reactants A, B and C, in which This Example illustrates the preparation of an amine epoxide reaction product from co reactants A, B, C and D in which the polyoxyalkylene polyamine is a triamine which has been pre reacted with either 1 or 2 moles of a mono epoxide. Two samples of 440 parts of a polyoxyalkylene triamine of molecular weight approximately 440 commercially available as Jeffamine T 403 were pre reacted with a 250 parts and b 500 parts, respectively, of glycidyl ether of a C₈ tertiary alkyl monocarboxylic acid, commercially available as Cardura E. In the case of a the mixture was heated to 120 C and after an exotherm the temperature was maintained at 140 C for 2 hours. The product had an amine value of 4.3 mm g and an epoxide value of zero. In the case of b the mixture was heated at 140 C for 1 hour. Heating was maintained at 140 C for a further 1 hour. The product had an amine value of 3.2 mm g and an epoxide value of zero.
