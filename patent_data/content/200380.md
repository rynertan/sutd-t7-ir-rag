# Moulding routing apparatus.

## Abstract
Apparatus for cutting grooves in the ends of moulding members enabling the moulding members to be joined in an L shaped assembly by inserting an L shaped bracket. A base 150 of the apparatus has a guide surface 151a to engage the reverse side of the moulding 101 and to position the moulding 101 directionally laterally, and to extend direc tionally longitudinally. A stop 155, 155a engages the mitred end 101b of the moulding 101 , to set the moulding 101 in a desired longitudinal position wherein it is held by clamp means 158 . A rotary router 100 projects into lapping relation with the mitred end 101b of the moulding 101 and is displaceable relative to the base to directionally sideward ly engage and penetrate the mitred end 101b of the moulding, thereby to produce a groove, the router thereafter being sidewardly removable from the groove. Adjustment means are provided to move the base 150 , laterally, thereby to position the mitred end of the mouding relative to the router 100 .
