## Abstract
A one piece, plastic, flat cable clamp has a base 10 , a pair of end walls 11, 12 on the base 10 and a cover 14 hinged on one of the end walls 11, 12 to fold over and extend across the base 10 in a latched closed position to retain a plurality of flat cables between the cover 14 and base 10 . The cable clamp is stackable on an identical cable clamp, the base of the upper cable clamp being positioned on the cover of the lower cable clamp and being retained thereon when its cover is in the latched closed position.
