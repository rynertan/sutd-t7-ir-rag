## Description
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An improved electrode for use in electrochemical reactions wherein the improvement comprises the use of an electrode that has a protective electronically conductive coating about 10 200 microns thick the coating comprises a film forming binder that is selected from the following group an acrylic polymer polysiloxane blend, a chlorosulfonated polyethylene epoxy resin blend, a chlorosulfonated ethylene vinyl acetate polymer epoxy resin blend, copolymer of vinylidene fluoride hexafluoropropylene polytetra fluoroethylene, copolymer of tetrafluoro ethylene perfluoroalkoxyvinyl ether, copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene and hexafluoropropylene, polyvinylidene fluoride, fluorinated dioxole polymer, copolymer of fluorinated dioxole tetrafluoroethylene, copolymer of fluorinated dioxole vinylidene fluoride, copolymer of fluorinated dioxole chlorotrifluoroethylene and electronically conductive finely divided filler material in a filler to binder weight ratio of about 50 100 to 300 100 and the binder containing filler has an electrical volume resistivity of about 0.1 50 ohm.cm. Detailed Description of the Invention This invention is directed to a coated electrode for use in electrochemical reactions that has a conductive substrate with a conductive coating, about 10 200 microns thick. The coating comprises a film forming binder which is inert to the corrosive medium typically used in the electrochemical reaction and contains electronically conductive, finely divided filler materials. Electrochemical reactions which subject electrodes to corrosive materials are used in the following chrome plating bath, electrowinniing cells for the recovery of metals, lead acid storage batteries and the like. Underground pipe lines are often protected by making them cathodic, and anodes connected to the pipe line are buried in the ground and are subject to corrosion. In the above, the electrodes used are subject to acids and corrosive conditions and currently require electrodes that are non corroding and very expensive, such as stainless steel or titanium metal or extra heavy duty electrodes so that failure does not occur within an unacceptable period. By providing a conductive and protective coating, less expensive electrodes could be used or smaller and lighter weight electrodes could be used. One typical example is the lead acid storage batteries. Lead acid storage batteries generally use lead alloy grids for electrodes, and use sulfuric acid as the electrolyte. The corrosion rate of these grids which typically are lead alloys of antimony or calcium can be reduced from one half to one third by coating these grids with one of the above conductive coatings. There are a number of advantages to using coated grids in batteries in comparison to conventional batteries that typically do not use coated grids. The battery life can be increased from 2 3 times without changing the battery since corrosion failure of the grid is substantially reduced and is one of the reasons for battery failure. The power output of a battery can be increased without a change in battery size and weight since thinner grids can be used which will have the same life as the thicker and heavier grids that are currently used. Size and weight of a battery can be reduced and the battery life will be the same as conventional batteries since thinner and lighter coated grids are used. Typical coating compositions used to form coatings on electrodes contain 10 80 by weight of a film forming binder, 20 90 by weight of a liquid carrier, and electronically conductive filler material in a filler to binder weight ratio of about 50 100 to 300 100. Preferably, the composition contains 40 70 by weight of the film forming binder, 30 60 by weight of the liquid carrier, and filler material in the above ratio. Generally, the liquid carrier is an organic solvent for the binder. The carrier can be aqueous to form a dispersion or a blend of a nonsolvent and solvent for the binder to form a nonaqueous dispersion. To be an effective coating for electrodes, the coating must be electronically conductive and have a low volume resistivity. The composition of the coating of binder and filler in its dried state has an electronic volume resistivity of about 0.1 50 ohms.cm. and preferably, 0.2 20 ohms.cm. Typical conductive filler materials are carbonaceous pigments, such as carbon black pigments like furnace black, acetylene black, and graphite. One preferred carbon black pigment is Gulf acetylene black.Preferably, a mixture of carbon black pigments and finely divided graphite are used. Transition metal oxides are also useful conductive filler materials, such as lead dioxide, magnetite, titanium suboxide having the formula TiOx where x is less than 2, ruthenium oxides, mixed titanium and ruthenium oxide pigments and the like. Powdered metals such as titanium sponge, powdered zirconium and tantalum alone or in combination with graphite also can be used. One useful coating composition has a film forming binder of a blend of about 20 90 by weight of an acrylic polymer and 10 80 by weight of a polysiloxane.Preferably, the composition contains about 50 75 by weight of the acrylic polymer and 25 50 by weight of the polysiloxane.

The polysiloxane has attached to silicone atoms of its backbone alkyl groups with 1 6 carbon atoms, phenyl groups and hydroxyl groups and containing sufficient hydroxyl groups to provide a silanol content of about 0.5 7 by weight. In general, the acrylic polymer must be compatible with the polysiloxane and contain a sufficient number of reactive groups, primarily glycidyl groups, to crosslink with the polysiloxane under ambient temperatures after the coating compositions has been applied to a substrate. The acrylic polymer should have a glass transition temperature of about 200C to 500C. A number average molecular weight of about 2,000 to 20,000, a weight average molecular weight of about 10,000 to 100,000 and a molecular weight distribution of about 2 to 5. The glass transition temperature of the polymer is determined by differential scanning colorimetry or is calculated. The acrylic polymer is prepared by conventional polymerization procedure in which monomers, catalyst and solvent are charged into a conventional polymerization vessel and reacted at about 60 to 1750C for about 1 6 hours to form the polymer. Typical solvents which are used to prepare the acrylic polymer are the following toluene, ethyl acetate, acetone, methyl isobutyl ketone, methylethyl ketone, ethyl alcohol, mineral spirits, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate, and other aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon, esters, ethers, ketones and alcohols which are conveniently used. About 0.1 4 by weight, based on the weight of the monomers, of the polymerization catalyst is used to prepare the acrylic polymer. Typical catalysts are azobis isobutyronitrile, azo bis gamma dimethyl valeronitrile , benzoyl peroxide, t butyl pivalate and the like. Preferably, the acrylic polymer contains about 10 30 by weight of glycidyl methacrylate or glycidyl acrylate and 70 90 by weight of other ethylenically unsaturated monomers. Typical ethylenically unsaturated monomers that are used to form the acrylic polymer are as follows alkyl methacrylates having 1 12 carbon atoms such as methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, butyl methacrylate, hexyl methacrylate, 2 ethylhexyl methacrylate, nonylmethacrylate, lauryl methacrylate, cyclohexyl methacrylate, isodecyl methacrylate, propyl methacrylate, phenyl methacrylate, isobornyl methacrylate and the like alkyl acrylates having 1 12 carbon atoms in the alkyl group such as methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, propyl acrylate, isopropyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, isobutyl acrylate, hexyl acrylate, 2 ethylhexyl acrylate, nonyl acrylate, lauryl acrylate, cyclohexyl acrylate, isodecyl acrylate, phenyl acrylate, isobornyl acrylate and the like styrene, alkyl substitued styrene such as methyl styrene, t butyl styrene, vinyl toluene. One preferred acrylic polymer contains about 10 30 by weight of glycidyl methacrylate, 10 20 by weight of styrene, 50 60 by weight of butyl methacrylate and 5 20 by weight butyl acrylate. One particularly preferred acrylic polymer contains 20 by weight glycidyl methacrylate, 15 by weight sytrene, 55 by weight butyl methacrylate and 10 by weight butyl acrylate. The polysiloxane contains the following unitsEMI6.1 where R and R1 are alkyl groups having 1 6 carbon atom, phenyl groups or hydroxyl groups and contains sufficient number of hydroxyl groups to provide a silanol content of about 0.5 7 by weight. One preferred resin is DowCorning s D.C. 840 silicone resin which formed by hydrolyzing selected amounts of mono, di and tri methyl chlorosilicone, mono, di and tri phenyl chlorosilicone,mono, di and tri propyl chlorosilicone and mono, di and tri amyl chloro silicone and the resulting products are condensed to form a resin blend having a silanol content of about 1.9 3 by weight.Other polysiloxane which give similar results areBayer s Baysilone Resin P150K, Rhone Poulenc s Rhodorsil 6406X and General Electric s SR 165. These polysiloxanes are proprietary products but are believed to be formed as described above. Trace amounts of multivalent metal ions of iron, aluminum, zinc and tin from the above pigments or from other sources, such as from the mill or mixing vessel in which t w c j11 C, iLiOn was prepared are present in the composition and co ordinate with the silanol groups of the polysiloxane. The metal ions catalyze the crosslinking reaction between the acrylic polymer and polysiloxane to provide ambient temperature curing of the coating composition after application to a substrate. If the metal ions complexed with the silanol groups are not present, elevated temperatures generally are required to cure the composition. To insure stability of the coating composition during storage, compounds such as acetyl acetone are added in amounts of about 0.75 3 by weight. The acetyl acetone complexes with metal ions in the composition and prevents catalyzation of the crosslinkiing reaction during storage. Upon application the acetyl acetone volatilizes and allows the metal ions to complex with the silanol groups as described above and catalyze curing of the finish. Other auxiliary stabilizers can also be added such as glycidyloxy alkoxy silanes such as gamma glycidoxypropyl trimethoxy silane.

Lead acid storage batteries made with the coated lead grids are expected to have a life of about 2 3 times that of batteries made with uncoated lead grids.Lead acid storage batteries can be made with grids that are 1 3 1 2 of the weight of conventional uncoated grids and can be expected to have a life equivalent to that of a conventional battery. Also, lead acid storage batteries can be made of the same size as conventional batteries but with substantially more power since the grids can be made thinner and more grids can be used in the battery.
