# Lead frame and housing for integrated circuit.

## Abstract
A lead frame is capable of use with integrated circuit chips of different sizes and having different numbers of termi nal areas, in that it comprises a centrally located support member, 5 and a plurality of leads 6,7 having inner end portions 8,12 which are integral with the support member 5 and having outer portions 10,16 forming a radiating pattern relative to the support member, at least one 7 of the loads being a composite lead comprising a trunk lead 12 and branch leads 13 extending from side edges of the trunk lead 12 at spaced intervals and at increasing distances from the support member 5 , whereby the lead frame can be used with a relatively small chip by removing the support member 5 and connecting the leads 6 excluding the trunk lead 12 , to the terminal areas of the chip, and the lead frame can be used with larger sizes of chips by removing the support member 5 and a portion of the trunk lead 12 adjacent to the support member 5 whereby branch and other leads 13,6 can be connected to terminal areas of the chip.
