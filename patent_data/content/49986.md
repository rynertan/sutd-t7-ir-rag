# Electric motor.

## Abstract
A synchronous motor comprising a permanent magnet rotor 18 and a stator 12 which, at start up, uses rectifiers 48,52 for supplying the stator coil 10 with rectified current and a commutator 26 comprising a rotary member 22 and fixed elements 28,30,32 , the rotary member 22 being axially displaceable 70 under the action of a centrifugal mechanism against a spring to disengage it from the fixed elements 28,30,32 when the rotor approaches synchronous speed and thereby connect the stator coil 10 directly with the AC supply 44 .
