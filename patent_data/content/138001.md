# Improved coolant level sensor arrangement for internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
In order to protect a level sensor from splashes, foaming and precipitation which occurs within the coolant jacket of an engine wherein the coolant is permitted to boil and the vapor used a vehicle for removing heat from the engine, the sensor is arranged within a shielding structure which becalms the environment immediately surrounding the sensor thus enabling accurate level control.
