# Radiation and static electricity suppression device.

## Abstract
A radiation and static electricity suppression device 13 is disclosed that is formed of a mesh fabric 14 having at least some of the yarns 22 capable of conducting electric ity. The mesh is affixed to a frame 16 that serves to con form the mesh to the surface of a cathode ray tube. A grounding earthing connection 26 is included to ground the mesh 14 to the chassis of the cathode ray tube 10 . The mesh 14 when grounded suppresses the static field and significantly reduces electromagnetic radiation emanating rom the CRT circuitry and passing through the opening in the CRT housing.
