# Dual transducer assembly with linear adjustment.

## Abstract
A linear adjustment mechanism for a doublesided flex ible disk head assembly includes a bearing slot 60 formed in the rear surface portion of a lower transducer arm 10 a slide block 13 carried by the upper surface 15 of the lower arm member 10 and an upper transducer arm mem ber 12 . The slide block has a vertically arranged bearing apperture 61 for accommodating a crank 70 having an offset pin 73 dimensioned to be received in the bearing slot 60 and a shank portion 72 dimensioned to be received in the bearing aperture 61 in the slide block. Rotation of the crank shank provides a translational force via the bearing slot and bearing aperture between the first and second arm members.
