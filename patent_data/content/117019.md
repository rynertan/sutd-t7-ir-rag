# Immunoassay methods employing patterns for the detection of soluble and cell surface antigens.

## Abstract
Methods for determining the presence of antigens or antibodies in an aqueous sample or presence of antigens on the surface of cells. A preferred embodiment employs fluorescent antigens which compete with the sample anti gens for antibody binding sites. The antibodies are deposited on a support surface means in alternating patterns. The surface means and fluorescence detector are translocated with respect to each other and a signal generated by the detection of the repeating pattern of fluorescence. The signal is analyzed by means of a gated integrator responsive to a gate track control means also located on the surface means. Immunoassay methods having increased sensitivity are thereby obtained.
