# A LIQUID RING PUMP

## Abstract
A liquid ring pump including a helically bladed rotor 2 eccentrically mounted in an elongated pump casing 1 and including a hub 3 , a suction inlet 18 and a discharge outlet 19 at respective ends of the pump casing 1 . The open space between the bladings ends at the inlet are closed by a preferably circular plate 26 and access to the space between the bladings are given only through one or more openings 27 in the plate 26 . This results in a minimizing of the power loss. Paddles 28 could be attached to the plate 26 and there could be a plate 31 at the discharge end as well. Further the holes 27 could be arranged in the hub 3 , and the end of the rotor at the inlet end could be located in a cavity 32 in the end wall 10 . Even further the edge of the helically blades 4 on the rotor 2 is pulled forward in the transportation direction, and the blades can have a slight curved form. The pump could also comprise an impeller 36 on the same shaft 5 as the rotor 2 and placed with the impeller blades in a short distance to the end wall 11 of the rotor housing 1 at the outlet end 19 . In the end wall 11 at the edge of the impeller 38 there could be a circular cavity 39 with radial walls 40 spaced through out the cavity. The pump could comprise one or more sickle shaped plates 22 attached to the internal wall of the pump casing 1 and surrounding the rotor 2 and one or more holes 35,36,37 could be arranged in the top part of the end walls 10,11 of the rotor housing 1 and the sickle shaped plates 29 .
