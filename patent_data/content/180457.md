## Description
The present invention relates to a semiconductor device. More particularly, it relates to an integrated circuit IC device of a compound semiconductor and a method for producing the same. The present invention also relates to an improvement in the isolation of active elements i.e active regions from each other in the compound semiconductor IC device. In silicon semiconductor IC devices it is necessary to form an isolation region or structure such as a PN junction, or insulating layer. In general, there has been no special need to form an isolation region in GaAs FET IC devices, since a channel region, source region, and drain region of each GaAs FET are formed in a semi insulating GaAs substrate by an ion implantation method. Recently, however, IC devices, such as FETs utilizing a two dimensional electron gas and heterojunction bipolar transistors, are produced by using a laminated layer formed on the substrate by a molecular beam epitaxy MBE or a metal organic chemical vapor deposition MOCVD . In this case, it is necessary to form an isolation region in the laminated layer so as to isolate the active elements regions from each other. Such an isolation can be achieved by etching portions of the laminated layer between active regions thereof so as to form island active regions e.g., cf. Fig. 1 of U.S. Serial No. 676,359 filed on November 29, 1984, corresponding to EP A 0143656 . In this type of isolation, steps formed by etching bring about a break in the interconnection conductor i.e., a so called step coverage failure , and a base area of each island active region is increased, preventing an increase in the integration degree. The isolation can be also achieved by implanting ions, such as hydrogen H and oxygen O into portions of the laminated layer except for the active regions, to make those portions inactive e.g., cf. Fig. 10 of U.S. Serial No. 587,967 filed on March 9, 1984, corresponding to EP A 0119089 . In this type of isolation, the resistivity of the isolation region is reduced by a heat treatment carried out in a later production step. During the heat treatment, the introduced ions diffuse and increase the area of the isolation region, also preventing an increase in the integration degree. It is difficult to carry out a deep inactivation by the ion implantation method. Especially where oxygen ions are implanted, carriers trapped at a gap center are apt to be excited when an electric field is applied to the ion introduced region, so that a current may flow. Furthermore, it is possible for the isolation to be achieved by a combination of etching and filling, namely, etching a portion of the laminated layer around the active regions to form a U shaped or V shaped groove and filling the groove with an insulating material, such as SiO₂ , Si₃N₄ , and polycrystalline silicon. Such a combination process is adopted, for example, in a V groove Isolation Polycrystal backfill structure VIP , and in a U groove isolation structure wherein the U groove is formed by a reactive ion etching RIE and filled with the insulating material , for silicon IC devices. However, where the U shaped or V shaped groove is formed in the laminated layer of the GaAs IC devices and is filled with SiO₂ , Si₃N₄ and the like, the difference in the thermal expansion coefficient between GaAs and SiO₂ Si₃N₄ produces an internal stress which may cause crystalline defects during a heat treatment. The thermal expansion coefficients of GaAs, SiO₂ , and Si₃N₄ are 8.7 0.1 x 10 ⁶ l K , 5 to 6 x 10 ⁷ l K , and 3 to 5 x 10 ⁶ l K , respectively. In this case, when GaAs is etched in the later step, the filled insulating material is not etched, so that a step is formed at the end of the isolation region. Such a step may bring about a step coverage failure of an interconnection conductor. Of interest too, are the field effect devices of US A 4,028,147 which are electrically isolated with a semi insulating semiconductor epitaxial layer. In this case, the elements are directly formed in the insulating layer and it is unnecessary to form an isolation region for isolating the elements from each other. Moreover M.E.Kim et al, JEEE Electron Device Letters, vol. EDL 1, No.8, August 1984 at pages 306 309 describes the use of monolithic integration techniques for facilitating GaAs GaAIAs selective epitaxy and which can be used for the isolation procedures of US A 4,028,147. An object of the present invention is to provide isolation of GaAs IC devices without the above mentioned disadvantages. Another object of the present invention is to provide a compound semiconductor IC device with an improved isolation structure. According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a semiconductor integrated circuit device comprising In order to achieve isolation of a compound semiconductor IC device, according to the present invention, a groove is formed by selectively etching a laminated layer and a portion of a semi insulating compound semiconductor substance and the groove is then filled with a semi insulating compound semiconductor. Thus, in a second aspect, the invention provides a method for producing a semiconductor integrated circuit, comprising the steps of Since the filler compound semiconductor material will generally be similar to or the same as the laminated layer and the substrate, regardless of conductivity type and impurity concentration, the thermal expansion coefficient and the crystal lattice of the former are almost the same as that of the latter, i.e. there is essentially lattice matching. Accordingly, any internal stress occurring during a heat treatment is very small. Furthermore, the filler compound semiconductor will generally be epitaxially grown in the groove, so that the interface of the filler to the laminated layer and substrate has good physical and electrical properties. The compound semiconductor of the substrate, each layer of the laminated layer, and the filler is generally a III V Group compound semiconductor, for example Ga Where each layer of the laminated layer has a first conductivity type e.g., n type or p type , the filler compound semi conductor may have a second conductivity type opposite that of the first conductivity type e.g., p type or n type . Where the laminated layer comprises an n type layer and a p type layer, then as in the above case, the filler compound semiconductor is generally a semi insulating semiconductor. Note, silicon IC devices have neither an intrinsic semiconductor isolation region nor a filler PN junction isolation structure. For a better understanding of the invention and to show how the same can be carried into effect reference will now be made, by way of example only, to the accompanying drawings Referring to Figs. 1 to 5, a GaAs IC device comprising hetero bipolar transistors and a method of producing the device according to a preferred first embodiment of the present invention are now described. As illustrated in Fig. 1, on a semi insulating GaAs substrate wafer 1, an n type GaAs layer 2 e.g., 900 nm thick , an n type GaAs layer 3 e.g., 500 nm thick , a p type GaAs layer 4 e.g., 100 nm thick , an n type AlGaAs layer 5 e.g., 150 nm thick and an n type GaAs layer 6 e.g., 150 nm thick are epitaxially formed in sequence by an MBE method. It is also possible to form the layers 2 to 6 by an MOCVD method. The GaAs layer 6 is covered with a suitable masking layer not shown having an opening corresponding to an isolation region pattern. The laminate of layers 2 to 6 and a portion of the substrate 1 are then selectively etched by a dry etching method e.g., RIE method or an ion milling method using argon ions Ar , to form a U shaped groove 7, as shown in Fig. 2. The groove 7 surrounds an island active region 8. The width of the groove 7 is from 0.3 to 5 µm. As illustrated in Fig. 3, a semi insulating GaAs layer 9 is deposited on the entire surface of the laminate of layers 2 to 6 by an MOCVD method, a chemical vapor deposition CVD method or a liquid phase epitaxy LPE method, to fill the U shape groove 7. An MBE method can be adopted for the formation of the semi insulating GaAs layer. In this case, the surface profile of the formed layer is different from that shown by the layer 9 in Fig. 3. A resist layer 100 is then applied over the undoped GaAs layer 9. It is possible to adopt organic material which is used in a spin coating method, instead of resist material. Next, the resist layer 100 and the semi insulating GaAs layer 9 are etched by an ion milling method using Ar ions, to leave a portion of the GaAs layer 9 within the groove 7, as shown in Fig. 4. The mixture ratio of CF₄ to O₂ is controlled to equalize an etch rate of the resist with that of the GaAs. Thus, the U shaped groove is filled with the semi insulating GaAs layer to complete the isolation structure. The hetero bipolar transistor Fig. 5 is formed in the isolated active region as follows. A resist pattern not shown is formed on a portion of the top GaAs layer 6 corresponding to an emitter region. Using the resist pattern as a mask, the top GaAs layer 6 is etched by a suitable etching method e.g., an RIE method using a reactive gas of CCl₂F₂ and a diluent gas of He . Another resist pattern not shown having an opening corresponding to a base region is formed on the exposed surface. Magnesium ions Mg or Beryllium ions Be are introduced into the layers 5, 4, and 3 through the opening by an ion implantation method to form a p type region 10. An annealing treatment after ion implantation is performed either at a temperature of 700 C for one hour in a furnace, or at a temperature of from 750 C to 900 C for 1 to 20 seconds by a lamp. A base electrode 11 of, e.g., Cr Au, is selectively formed on the p type region 10. Then, the layers 5, 4, and 3 are selectively etched to form a groove 12 for a collector contact extending beyond the p type region 10. At the same time, an emitter electrode 13 and a collector electrode 14 are selectively formed on the top GaAs layer 6 and on the GaAs layer 2, respectively. These electrodes 13 and 14 are made of, e.g., AuGe Au. A heat treatment a so called alloying treatment for the electrodes 13 and 14 is performed at a temperature from 400 to 450 C for 5 seconds to 5 minutes. Thus, the transistor is completed. In the above description, the n type GaAs layer 2 is a sub collector layer for decreasing a collector series resistance the n type GaAs layer 3 is a collector layer the p type GaAs layer 4 is a base layer the n type AlGaAs layer 5 is an emitter layer, e.g., a wide gap emitter layer and the n type GaAs layer 6 is a contact layer for decreasing a contact resistance of an emitter. In this embodiment, the filler semi insulating GaAs layer is epitaxially grown to be a single crystal having a thermal expansion coefficient of 8.7 0.1 x 10 ⁶ l K . Since this coefficient is equal to or very close to that of each of the layers 2 to 6 and the substrate 1, an internal stress causing crystalline defects is not generated in the obtained structure. Also, interfaces between two adjoining materials selected from the filler GaAs 9, each of the layers 2 to 6, and the substrate 1 are subjected to substantially no stress, and thus the interfaces do not have an adverse influence on the properties of the elements. The epitaxially grown semi insulating GaAs layer 9 has a good quality interface with the layers 2 to 6 and substrate 1 and has a small number of interface traps. On the other hand, a filler insulator such as silicon oxide and silicon nitride has a large number of interface traps and the fixed charge formed at the interface may vary a potential distribution and generate a surface leakage current and a surface recombination current. Furthermore, when the wide gap emitter layer is adopted, a counter injection from base to emitter does not occur, although the impurity concentration of the base region is increased. Therefore, it is possible to make use of the special characteristics, such as a high emitter injection efficiency and low base resistance, of the hetero bipolar transistor. Figure 6 is a schematic partially sectional view of a GaAs IC device having an enhancement mode GaAs FET and a depletion mode GaAs FET, which FETs utilize a two dimensional electron gas, according to a second embodiment of the present invention. On a semi insulating GaAs substrate wafer 21, an undoped GaAs layer 22, an undoped AlGaAs layer a spacer layer 23, an n type AlGaAs layer electron supply layer 24, an n type GaAs layer 25, an etching stoppable n type AlGaAs layer 26, and a contact n type GaAs layer 27 are formed in sequence by an MBE method or an MOCVD method. It is possible to omit the undoped AlGaAs layer 23. The layers 22 to 27 are selectively etched to form a U shaped groove extending into the undoped GaAs layer 22. The groove is filled with semi insulating GaAs 28 in a manner similar to that of the first embodiment. The groove containing the filler of semi insulating GaAs 28 surrounds an active region i.e., a portion of the laminated layer to isolate that region from another region. It is possible to adopt a p type GaAs instead of the semi insulating GaAs, since all of the layers 24 to 27 have n type conductivity and there is no p type layer. Ohmic contact electrodes 30, 31, and 32 of AuGe Au are selectively formed on the n type GaAs layer 27. A heat treatment for alloying e.g., at 450 C for 1 minute is carried out. Then, portions of the GaAs layer 27 and the AlGaAs layer 26 corresponding to a gate region of the enhancement mode FET are etched by a suitable etching method. Portions of the GaAs layers 25 and 27 are simultaneously etched to form a groove for the gate electrode of the enhancement mode FET and a groove for the gate of the depletion mode FET. This etching treatment is carried out by an RIE method using an etchant gas of CCl₂F₂ and a diluent or carrier gas of He, since an etch rate of GaAs is about 200 times larger than that of AlGaAs. A gate electrode 33 and a gate electrode 34 of Ti Pt Au are selectively formed on the AlGaAs layers 24 and 26, respectively. An insulating layer 35 of, e.g., SiO₂ , is deposited on the entire exposed surface and is selectively etched to form contact holes. Then interconnecting conductor lines 36, 37, and 38 of Ti Au are formed. Thus, the GaAs IC device in which the enhancement mode and depletion mode GaAs FETs are formed in the isolated active region, is produced. Referring to Fig. 7, the effect of a semi insulating semiconductor layer sandwiched between two n type semiconductor layers is now explained. An energy band of the n S.I. n type GaAs layers is indicated by solid lines and that of the n i n type Si layer is indicated by broken lines. As is evident from Fig. 7, the barrier height of the semi insulating GaAs layer is higher than that of the intrinsic Si layer. In the case of the GaAs layers, it is very difficult for electrons to pass over the barrier, so that the semi insulating GaAs layer can serve as an isolation layer. In the case of the Si layers, electrons can pass over the barrier, so that generally the intrinsic Si layer is not used for the isolation layer. Among variants to the above described procedures which may be adopted while not departing from the invention as defined in the appended claims the following may be mentioned. For example, prior to the formation of the semi insulating GaAs layer, an SiO₂ layer may be formed on the top GaAs layer. The portion of the semi insulating GaAs layer deposited on the SiO₂ layer becomes polycrystalline. The polycrystalline GaAs can be etched faster than the single crystalline GaAs, and the SiO₂ layer is then removed. Furthermore, the isolation structure according to the present invention can be used in a HET Hot Electron Transistor IC or a RHET Resonant Hot Electron Transistor IC, which are disclosed in, e.g., U.S. Serial No.754,416.
