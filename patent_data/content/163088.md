# Double grip, relative motion tube puller.

## Abstract
A tube puller apparatus 1 and a process for pulling tubes 110 from a tubesheet 112 with relatively movable upper and lower linked gripping means. This assembly includes an outer sleeve 5 where the lower gripping means 3 is located, and a middle sleeve 26 where the upper gripping means 25 is located which is slidable a predeter mined distance within the outer sleeve 5 . The tube puller 1 is inserted into a tube 110 , and the lower gripping means 3 is engaged to the mouth of the tube. The upper gripping means 25 is engaged beyond the tube mouth. A puller including a hydraulic ram 117 applies a tensile force onto the lower gripping means 3 to pull on the mouth of the tube 110 and to plastically contract the outer diameter of the tube in the vicinity of the tubesheet 112 . Then the connecting assembly between the two gripping means extends to its maximum length, and the pulling means applies a tensile force to both the upper and lower gripping means. Both of the gripping means then coact to withdraw the tube 110 from the tubesheet 112 .
