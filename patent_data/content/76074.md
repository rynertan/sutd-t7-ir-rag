# Device for applying a high frequency electromagnetic field to living tissue to promote healing thereof.

## Abstract
A portable therapy device for attachment to a patient to promote tissue healing by exposure to an r.f. field, comprises an oscillator 5 which energises an antenna having a transmitting element 1 the natural directive pattern of which is modified by a reflector 8 and a parasitic element 10 such that a major part of the r.f. field emitted by the antenna passes to the patient. In another embodiment the antenna is configured to produce a spatially substantially uniform field strength over the area of the patient being treated. The device subjects the tissue to r.f. power levels which produce no significant tissue heating.
