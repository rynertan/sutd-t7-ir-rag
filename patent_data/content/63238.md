## Description
AN EFFICIEtiCY I9ROVIiQG AGENT FOR FEED AND A PREVENTIVE AND TREATING AGENT FOR COCCIDIOSIS FIELD OF THE INVENTION The prevent invention relates to an efficiency improving agent for a livestock or poultry feed or a preventive and treating agent for livestock or poultry coccidiosis containing antibiotics. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Attempts have already been made widely to promote the growth of and improve the fecundity of poultry and livestock by the addition of an antibiotic to feed. In the case of an antibiotic used in both man and animals, however, man is subject to deleterious effects such as the emergence of resistant bacteria and so forth since he is bound to simultaneously ingest the antibiotic that has remained and accumulated in the animal body when he eats the animals. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide an efficiency improving agent for a livestock or poultry feed or a preventive and treating agent for livestock or poultry coccidiosis which is free of the above described drawbacks. As a result of extensive investigations it is found that antibiotics 5057A and 5057B can remarkably improve the efficiency of the utilization of a livestock and poultry feed and have a preventive and treating activity against livestock and poultry coccidiosis. The present invention is based on this finding and provides an efficiency improving agent for a livestock or poultry feed or a preventive and treating agent for livestock or poultry coccidiosis which contains antibiotic 5057A or its physiologically acceptable salt and or antibiotic 5057B or its physiologically acceptable salt as an effective ingredient. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Antibiotics 5057A and 5057B are the ones found in a culture broth of a Streptomyces s.p. 5057 strain FERM BP 62 , method for the preparation of the antibiotics 5057A and 5057B and physical and chemical characteristics thereof are described in Japanese Patent Publication No. 8641 1979 andJapanese Patent Application No. 158856 1980, respectively.Both of the antibiotics are produced by cultivating a Streptomyces s.p. 5057 strain according to the usual method. The A and B substances can be isolated according to the ordinary method they can also be obtained as a mixture. The antibiotics 5057A and 5057B both belong to an antibiotic of the polyether series and are knawn to have an excellent antibacterial activity. The effective ingredient of the composition of the present invention, antibiotic 5057A andlor 5057B can be used in the form of a purified preparation or a crude product, or as cells containing the effective ingredient. The antibiotics 5057A and 5057B may be in the form of a physiologically acceptable salt such as sodium and potassium salts. The efficiency improving agent for feed or preventive and treating agent for coccidiosis is, used as a preparation, such as powders, tablets, capsules, granules, and pills, that is prepared by either mixing or not mixing antibiotic 5057A and or 5057B with a physiologically acceptable solid or liquid diluent however, usually it is used by directly incorporating it into feed or drinking water or by adding its dispersion in a diluent to feed or drinking water. It is, when added to feed, used preferably as, for example, a premix prepared from it. The premix is obtained by mixing a purified product or a crude product of the effective ingredient, or cells containing it with a physiologically acceptable solid or liquid carrier.As a solid carrier, there are used, for example, flour, soybean powders, rice bran, corn powders, starch, glucose, yeast, fish meal, talc, and diatomaceus earth, etc. As a liquid carrier, there are used, for example, physiological saline solution, distilled water, and a physiologically acceptable organic solvent, etc. Further, suitable supplementary agents or additives such as an emulsifying agent, dispersant, suspending agent, moistening agent, concentrating agent, gelation agent, antimicrobial agent, antiseptic agent, enzyme preparation, antibiotic, and lactic acid preparation, etc. can also be used in admixture with the foregoing preparations. The concentration of the effective ingredient in the premix can suitably be adjusted depending on the kind of livestock or poultry. The concentration for use of the efficiency improving agent for feed of the present invention varies according to the kind and age of livestock or poultry for example, in the case of poultry such as a domestic fowl, quail, turkey, guinea fowl, duck, and goose, it is administered as a feed containing usually 5 200 ppm, preferably 10 100 ppm, of the effective ingredient. There are used a feed containing.usually 5 200 ppm, preferably 10 100 ppm, of the effective ingredient in the case of swine and a feed containing usually 1 100 ppm, preferably 2 50 ppm, of the effective ingredient in the case of a ruminant such as cattle, sheep, and goat.As a preventive and treating agent for coccidiosis, there is used a feed containing 10 250 ppm, preferably 20 100 ppm, of the effective ingredient. The effective ingredient of the present invention, antibiotics 5057A and 5057B, are excellent in that it is effective in not only improving the efficiency of feed but also promoting the growth it also has a special feature of low toxicity. The present agent, when administered to poultry, can improve the efficiency of feed, prevent the occurrence of coccidiosis which is dreadful for poultry, and cure the desease. On its administration to swine, it not only improves the efficiency of the feed utilization but also prevents and cures diarrhea from which a young pig is liable to suffer. On its administration to a ruminant, an increased ratio of propionic acid to acetic and butyric acids in the rumen of the animal is observed. In general the utilization ratio of propionic acid is said to be large in the stomach of a ruminant, although a ruminant also utilizes acetic and butyric acid compounds in its stomach.It t is considered that the production of tropionic acid is promoted in the rumen by the administration of the present agent, and as a result the utilization efficiency of feed is improved. The present invention will be explained in detail by the following examples and test examples.EXAMPLE 1 5057A 1 cornstarch 99 The two substances are crushed and mixed uniformly to make a premix containing 1 of 5057A.EXAMPLE 2 5057B 5 soybean powders 95 A premix containing 5 of 5057B is prepared in the same manner as in Example 1. EXAMPLE 3 5057A o,5 5057B 0.5 soybean cake 99 A premix containing 0.5 of 5057A and 0.5 of 5057B is prepared in the same manner as in Example 1.EXAMPLE 4 crude product of 5057A 40 purity 2.5 crude product of 5057B 40 purity 2.5 bran 95 The substances are crushed and mixed uniformly to make a premix containing 1.0 of 5057A and 1.0 of 5057B.EXAMPLE 5 Dried cultured cells 1000 g containing 1.128 of 5057A and 0.86 of 5057B are crushed and used, as they are, as a premix.TEST EXAMPLE 1 Feed efficiency test on domestic fowls Domestic fowls tested species used exclusively for broiler Aber Acres species Basal feed yellow corn 42 flour 25 soybean cake 20 fish cake 8 alfalfa meal 3 tricalcium phosphate 1 calcium carbonate 0.25 table salt 0.45 vitamin 0.15 mineral 0.1 methionine 0.05 Method Fifty newborn chickens were divided into 5 groups of 10 each in such a way that the average body weight is the same in each group. Premixes of 5057A and 5057B were added to the foregoing basal feed so that the contents of 5057A and 5057B are .40 ppm and 80 ppm, respectively. This feed was administered to the animals over the period of 70 days, and the body weight and the ingested amount of the feed were measured. The results are shown in Table 1 below.

To the basal feed were added 50 and 100 ppm each of 5057A and 5057B. Infection with coccidiosis was done by inoculating 7 x 1014 per chicken of spore forming oocysts of Eimeria tenellum directly p.o. into the crop of the chickens. Groupsl 4 were reared with the feeds containing predetermined concentrations of the 5057 substances, starting from 1 day before the inoculation with oocysts. Group 5 is an infection control that was inoculated with oocysts and reared with the basal feed containing no agents tested and Group 6 is a non infection control. After 7 days after the inoculation with oocysts, the number of oocysts OPG in 1 g of stool was counted. The results are shown in Table 5 below.
