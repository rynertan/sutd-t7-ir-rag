# GYROSCOPE PICK OFF

## Abstract
The disclosure relates to a gyroscope in which an electric signal corresponding to an angle α, α between the rotor 9 of the gyroscope and the suspension means 7 of the rotor is generated. The rotor 9 is provided with one or more permanent magnets 13 . An element 14 of magnetic mate rial is disposed in the suspension means of the rotor so that the latter may move in relation to the element during its rotation. The element may be passed by the magnetic fields of the permanent magnets during rotation of the rotor so that magnetic flux changes occur in the element. The element 14 is arranged such that the flux changes are dependent upon the above mentioned angle and the flux changes are sensed by an electric induction winding 15 which generates the electric signal.
