# Electrochemical detector.

## Abstract
An electrochemical detector is disclosed which is espe cially suited for analysis of rapidly changing flowing streams such as found in high performance liquid chromatography. A jet made of microbore drawn capillary tubing 410 permits the construction of a cell for very low flow rates that still retains true wall jet hydrodynamics. Changes in cell re sponse in time are prevented by periodically cleaning a working electrode 310 . Cleaning and detection are both accomplished on a time scale much shorter than the fastest liquid chromatograph peaks by means of a three electrode cell design utilizing a small diameter, low capacitance, metal working electrode 310 situated close to a reference elec trode 370 . Cleaning is accomplished by means of a nonsquare wave periodic waveform which is effective in cleaning a wide variety of contaminants through the oxida tion and reduction of the working electrode 310 and or solvent prior to application of one or more working poten tials while providing a stable, reproducible detector. The detector thus provides improvements in both sensitivity and bandwidth over the prior art.
