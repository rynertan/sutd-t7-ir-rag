# Method for immunochemical measurement of trace components.

## Abstract
In an immunochemical measurement method of an antigen or antibody which comprises competitively re acting an antigen or antibody labelled with spectral sensitizer and an antigen or antibody to be measured, bringing either the reaction product of immune reaction or the unreacted component into contact with silver halide, exposing the same to light having a wavelength which the spectral sensitizer absorbs, developing the exposed silver, and, measuring optical density of the thus formed silver image and or colored dye, the con tact with silver halide is performed in the presence of a specific hydrazine compound. Thus, detection sensi tivity is markedly improved.
