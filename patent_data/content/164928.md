# VERTICAL HOT WALL CVD REACTOR

## Abstract
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for chemical vapor deposition of then film material layers onto a substrate. The method and apparatus can be used for epitaxially depositing silicon, for example, in the fabrication of semiconductor electronic devices. The apparatus has a multiple substrate reactor 12 , each having substrate carrier supports 14 , which are rotated and wherein the reaction gases are passed separately via interior manifolds 15, 16 into contact with each substrate carried and rotated by the supports 14 . The heat source 11 is an electrical resistance heated furnace element 11 surrounding theprocess cham ber 12, 13 , producing a hot wall condition, heretofore considered unacceptable for epitaxial silicon growth.
