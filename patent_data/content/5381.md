## Description
EJECTION DEVICE The present invention relates to moulding and in particular to ejection devices for use with moulding tools. Ejection devices for use with moulding tools, especially in injection moulding apparatus normally comprised an injector plate mounted on a cavity plate of the moulding tool for movement towards and away from the cavity plate and carrying a nrher of ejection pins which when the ejector plate is moved towards the cavity plate passed through openings in the cavity plate to extend proud of the interior surface of the cavity plate so that the moulding within the cavity plate is pushed out by the pins in their passage through the openings. Movement of the ejector plate towards the cavity plate is normally effected by a force applied to a rod or rods extending perpendicularly to the ejector plate.This means that a considerable space is required below the cavity plate of the moulding tool to accommodate the ejection device and its associated operating means, which are normally hydraulic. This invention provides an ejection device for use with a moulding tool comprising an ejector plate capable of being mounted on a cavity plate of the moulding tool for movement towards and away from the cavity plate and carrying at least one ejection pin which, when the ejector plate is moved towards the cavity plate, passes through an opening in the cavity plate to extend proud of the surface thereof, wherein cam means provided on the underside of the ejector plate remote from the cavity plate are operable to cause said movement of the ejector plate towards the cavity plate. By the use of cam means for operating the ejection device of the invention it is possible to locate the operating means for the ejection device to one side of the moulding tool instead of in line with the moulding tool and thus the space required for accommodating the moulding tool with its associated ejector plates can be greatly reduced. In a preferred form of the invention the cam means comprises one or more rolling bearing means that co operate with one or more wedge shaped driving surfaces. The wedge shaped driving surfaces may be provided on the underside of the ejector plate with the rolling bearing means being provided on a movable member such that when moved from a rest position to an operative position they bear on the wedged shaped driving surfaces and force the ejector plate towards the cavity plate but preferably the rolling bearing means are carried on the ejector plate and the wedge shaped driving surfaces are provided on a movable member. The movable member is preferably a movable bar extending generally parallel to and spaced at a fixed distance from the ejector plate. The invention will now be described by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 1 is a bottom plan of part of a moulding tool having an ejection device embodying the invention Fig. 2 is a vertical section on the line II II in Fig. 1 and Fig. 3 is a vertical section on the line III III in Fig. 1, showing the ejection device in its operative position. A moulding tool, part only of which is shown in the drawings includesea cavity plate 11 on the under face of which is mounted an ejection device 12 which includes a movable ejector plate 13 which carries a number of ejector pins 20 of the device 12. The ejection device 12 is accommodated within a housing 25 which comprises a bottom plate 26 secured to end walls 27 that act as spacer blocks separating the bottom plate 26 from the cavity plate 11. The ejector plate 13 is slideably mounted by means of bushes 14 on four support pillars 15 which extend from the bottom plate 25 and are secured by screws 16 to the plate 11. The ejector plate 13 is normally held spaced from the cavity plate 11 by means of compression springs 17 that surround four shoulder screws 16A, which pass slideably through SlateB, which springs act between the ejector plate 13 and the under face of the cavity plate 11. On the side of the ejector plate 13 remote from the cavity plate 11 is mounted a pair of rollers 18 each accommodated in a respective housing 19 secured to the plate 13 by screws 21 and dowels 23 and having a spindle 24 about which the roller is rotatable. The rollers 18 each co operate with a respective one of a pair of wedge surfaces 28 provided on a bar 29 that is slideably mounted in a groove 30 in the inner surface of the bottom plate 26 and extends longitudinally through the housing 25. Bar 29 has an end 31 disposed outside the housing 25, which end 31 is connected to an hydraulic cylinder not shown . The bar 29 can be moved from its rest position shown inFig. 2 to an operative position in which the pins 20 stand proud of the uppersurface of the cavity plate 11 and eject the moulded article from the moulding tool. In use, operation of the hydraulic cylinder pulls on the bar 29 causing the wedge surfaces 28 to push on the rollers 18, causing the ejector plate 13 to move towards the cavity plate 11 compressing the springs 17. The outer ends of the ejector pins 20 are normally accommodated in openings 32 in the cavity plate 11, but as the ejector plate 13 moves towards the cavity plate 11, the pins 20 move through the openings 32 to extend proud of the interior surface of the cavity plate as shown in Fig. 3 . When the bar 29 is returned to its initial rest position by the hydraulic cylinder, the springs 17 return the ejector plate 13 to its initial position, retracting the pins 20 through the openings 32. The ejection device above described can be fitted into a small space allowing several moulding cavities to be fitted into the same mould height on a moulding machine. In addition, the use of an hydraulic cylinder disposed outside the mould allows for easy maintenance and repair
