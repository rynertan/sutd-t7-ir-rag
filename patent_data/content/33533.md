# METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR THE AUTOMATIC CLASSIFICATION OF PATTERNS

## Abstract
Methods and apparatus for the automatic classification of patterns are disclosed in which the intensity or gray level values of selected pixels of digital images of functions of position invariant transforms of patterns to be classified, dis played as intensity functions, are correlated with one or more stored sets of values, each such stored set of values corres ponding to one of the classes into which the unclassified patterns are to be classified. Methods of determining the coordinates of the selected pixels for use in automatic signa ture verification and automatic handwritten numeral recogni tion are disclosed.
