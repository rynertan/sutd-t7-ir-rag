# PHASE ON RIDE THROUGH CONTROL CIRCUIT

## Abstract
A D.C. power supply 10, 44 having an auxiliary bridge rectifier 14, 38, 48 connected in series with a primary bridge rectifier 12, 46 is disclosed. The auxiliary bridge rectifier 14, 38, 48 floats above the potential of the primary bridge recti fier 12, 46 furnishing additional voltage at the D.C. power supply output 20, 22 56, 58 whenever the A.C. mains volta ge input to the main bridge rectifier 12, 46 drops below a pre determined value. In one embodiment of the present invention, a series of SCR s 26, 28 arranged in three phase configura tion perform the rectification and regulation functions of the primary bridge rectifier 12, 46 and the auxiliary bridge recti fier 14, 18 . In an alternate embodiment of the present inven tion, paired SCR s 40 and diodes 42 are arranged in a half controlled auxiliary bridge rectifier configuration 38 . Indivi dual firing angles for the various SCR s 26, 28, 40 are com puted as a composite of several factors, including a firing delay factor α ₀, a load current correction factor Δα and a phase shift compensation factor α α. Each of the several factors employed in calculating individual firing angles can be ascer tained in accordance with the desired D.C. voltage output of the D.C. power supply 10, 44 .
