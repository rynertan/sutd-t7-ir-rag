## Description
This invention relates to improved oral compositions for dental hygiene, and, in particular, to dental rinse formulations which upon application to the teeth, loosen plaque present on dental surfaces and render it more amenable to removal during brushing with a conventional dentifrice. Dental plaque is present to some degree, in the form of a film, on virtually all dental surfaces. It is a by product of microbial growth, and comprises a dense microbial layer consisting of a mass of microorganisms embedded in a polysaccharide matrix. The microorganisms present in plaque are mainly coccoidal organisms, particularly in early plaque, which, in the mouths of some persons at least, change to filamentous organisms after a few days. Plaque itself adheres firmly to dental surfaces and is removed only with difficulty even through a rigorous brushing regimen. Moreover, plaque rapidly reforms on the tooth surface after it is removed. A wide variety of microorganisms are found in the oral cavity, and among these are gram positive anaerobic rods associated with the development of plaque such as In addition to the aforementioned microorganisms, there is also present in plaque relatively small amounts of other substances such as salivary proteins, carbohydrates, epithelial cells and leucocytes. These organisms play a key role in the etiology of plaque. The bacterial organisms associated with plaque formation produce a capsular material which apparently causes the cells of the organism to adhere to each other, holding the plaque together and allowing for further growth. For example, one of the capsule forming bacteria which occurs in large numbers in early plaque is Plaque may form on any part of the tooth surfaces, and is found particularly at the gingival margin, in cracks in the enamel, and on the surface of dental calculus. As discussed in greater detail below, the danger associated with the formation of plaque on the teeth lies in the tendency of plaque to build up and eventually produce gingivitis, periodontitis and other types of periodontal disease, as well as dental caries and dental calculus. More specifically, dental plaque is a precursor to the formation of the hard crystalline buildup on teeth referred to as dental calculus. Both the bacterial and the nonbacterial components of plaque mineralize to form calculus, which comprises mineralized bacteria as well as organic constituents, such as epithelial cells, live bacteria, salivary proteins, leucocytes, and crystals of substances having molecularly bound calcium and phosphorus, e.g., hydroxyapatite, 3 Ca₃ PO₄ ₂ Ca OH ₂, octacalcium phosphate, Ca₈ HPO₄ ₂ PO₄ ₄.5H₂O, brushite, CaHPO₄.₂H₂O, and whitlockite, which is considered to have the formula beta Ca₃ PO₄ ₂. Dental plaque and, hence, calculus are particularly prone to form at the gingival margin, i.e., the junction of the tooth and gingiva. The buildup of plaque at the gingival margin is believed to be the prime cause of gingivitis and other periodontal disorders. Regular tooth brushing with a conventional dentifrice for some persons greatly retards or even prevents the accumulation of significant amounts of plaque and calculus. For other persons, however, plaque builds up rapidly even with regular brushing, which, in turn, leads to the formation of calculus, caries, and presents the danger of periodontal diseases. Removal by a dentist is currently the only safeguard against serious gingival inflammation caused by the accumulation of significant amounts of of plaque in some individuals. It is widely recognized in dentistry that a rigorous brushing regimen alone for many individuals will not prevent the formation of significant amounts of plaque. Mouthwashes are employed in conventional regimens of oral hygiene. US A 4 132 770 discloses a mouthwash product of a pH of 8.0 9.3 comprising 0.2 sodium lauryl sulfate and detergent builder but no sodium benzoate. However, conventional mouthwashes serve primarily to sweeten the breath, are formulated for that purpose, and are believed not to function in any significant way to loosen or remove plaque from the dental surfaces. Moreover, since the user typically does not employ a mouthwash expressly for the purpose of cleansing the teeth of plaque, mouthwashes are not routinely used immediately prior to brushing as a way of rendering plaque and or calculus more amenable to removal during the subsequent brushing process. There is, therefore, a definite need in the art for an oral hygiene composition which, when used alone, or in conjunction with a regular tooth brushing regimen, renders the plaque present on the dental surface more susceptible to removal during a subsequent brushing regimen employing a conventional dentifrice. In view of the foregoing, we have found it possible to provide an improved dental rinse which has a detersive effect upon plaque, and which functions to loosen the plaque present on dental surfaces, and thereby to aid in the reduction of caries formation, and to deter the development of calculus and oral diseases associated with excessive plaque formation such as gingivitis and periodontitis. We have also found it possible to provide an improved method of dental hygiene, and for removing, loosening and retarding the further development of plaque on dental surfaces. This invention provides a dental rinse intended for application to dental surfaces for the purpose of loosening the adherence of plaque present on the teeth, and retarding the further accumulation of plaque on the treated dental surfaces. In one aspect, the invention provides a dental rinse composition for loosening and removing plaque on dental surfaces comprising an aqueous or an aqueous and alcoholic carrier for ingredients of said dental rinse composition, wherein the ingredients include 0.1 to 10 by weight sodium lauryl sulfate and at least 1 by weight sodium benzoate effective for increasing the amenability of said plaque to removal when said composition is applied to dental surfaces, said composition further including a detergent builder and having a pH of 7.5 to 10. In a further aspect, the invention provides a method of cleaning dental surfaces which comprises applying a cleansing amount to said dental surfaces of a dental rinse composition comprising an aqueous or an aqueous and alcoholic carrier for ingredients of said dental rinse composition, wherein the ingredients include 0.1 to about 10 by weight sodium lauryl sulfate, at least 1 by weight sodium benzoate, a detergent builder, and said composition having a pH of 7.5 to 10. In a preferred embodiment of this invention the dental rinse comprises an alkaline solution with a pH of 8.0 to 9.0. It has been found that when sodium benzoate is employed in the alkaline dental rinse described above, the ability of the formulation to loosen plaque and to prevent plaque buildup subsequent to the application of the dental rinse is unexpectedly and significantly enhanced. It is also preferred to employ a nonionic oral surfactant in combination with sodium borate as the detergent building component of the dental rinse. In further embodiments of the dental rinse of this invention, minor effective amounts of colorant, flavorant, antiseptics, healing agents and other additives are advantageously employed in combination with the other ingredients. More specifically, formulations of the dental rinse of this invention may include antiseptically effective amounts of sodium salicylate, ethanol which may also serve as all or part of the liquid carrier , and an antiseptically active flavorant, e.g., thymol eucalyptol menthol. Of course, sodium benzoate itself imparts antiseptic properties to the formulation. Formulations, containing the foregoing ingredients, serve to sooth gums irritated from brushing, and when healing agents are employed, to actually enhance the rate of healing of gums and associated tissues which may have become irritated during brushing or due to an existing periodontal disorder such as gingivitis. This invention also provides a method for cleaning and loosening plaque from dental surfaces which comprises the step of applying the dental rinse composition described above to the dental surfaces of the oral cavity. In preferred embodiments of the method of this invention, the rinse is applied to the dental surfaces immediately prior to the step of brushing the teeth with a conventional dentifrice. It is believed that the dental rinse of this invention renders the plaque present on dental surfaces quite susceptible to subsequent removal during an ordinary brushing process. The dental rinse of this invention may be applied to the surface of the teeth by any conventional process. Preferably, however, the dental rinse is applied by placing a comfortable amount of the dental rinse in the oral cavity and then circulating the rinse about the mouth with the intention of thoroughly soaking the teeth and gums. The dramatic reduction in plaque content accomplished through the use of the dental rinse and associated methods of this invention should also serve both to reduce dental caries closely associated with plaque buildup, as well as preventing or ameliorating plaque and plaque associated oral disorders such as gingivitis and periodontitis. Further preferred features and embodiments of the invention are described below. The dental rinse formulations of this invention comprise an alkaline solution having a pH of 7.5 to 10, preferably about 8.0 or above, of sodium lauryl sulfate and a detergent builder therefor in a liquid carrier. The liquid carrier may be water or a solution of water and alcohol ethanol . The liquid carrier may comprise from about 70 to about 95 of the formulation, e.g. the formulation may include as the liquid carrier a component of about 65 to 95 water and about 5 to 35 ethanol. Sodium lauryl sulfate is employed as an oral surfactant in the dental rinse of this invention and is nontoxic and therefore suitable for use in the oral cavity. This surfactant provides a detersive effect when the formulation containing it is applied in about tablespoon quantities to the oral cavity. As explained below, a detergent builder is employed in conjunction with the oral surfactant. Sodium lauryl sulfate is employed in the aqueous or ethanolic solvent of the dental rinse at levels ranging from 0.1 to about 10 by weight of the composition, and most preferably from about 0.5 to about 2 of the composition. However, in general, the amount of surfactant employed is adjusted to provide the desired degree of detersive effect or, if desired, foam in the oral cavity during use. Dental rinses formed with sodium lauryl sulfate display a number of desired characteristics. For instance, when sodium lauryl sulfate is added at a concentration from 0.1 to 1.5 , plaque removal on initial use is high, and unremoved plaque exhibits markedly decreased viability and markedly increased susceptibility to removal by simple mechanical methods. The pH drop that usually occurs shortly after using a rinse is effectively delayed, indicating that production of acid by unremoved plaque has been substantially halted. Furthermore, a rinse formulated with sodium lauryl sulfate is effective at a much greater dilution than is a rinse formulated without such an alkaline alkyl sulfate. Without prejudice to the scope of the invention, it is believed that sodium lauryl sulfate acts as a potentiator for other ingredients of the rinse, thereby increasing their ability to loosen plaque, and their ability to penetrate bacterial colonies. A detergent builder is employed in combination with the oral surfactant component of the dental rinse. The detergent builders employed herein are nontoxic, orally compatible materials which are distinctly basic in aqueous solution, for example, sodium carbonate, sodium borate, mixtures thereof, or alkaline mixtures of sodium carbonate and or sodium borate with sodium bicarbonate. Preferably, the detergent builder is sodium borate and is present in amounts ranging from about 0.1 to about 1 , and most preferably, 0.2 to about 0.5 by weight of the rinse formulation. It is believed that the use of a detergent builder in conjunction with the surfactant component of this invention in basic solution enhances the ability of the dental rinse to both loosen and dislodge plaque from dental surfaces during rinsing, while at the same time enhancing the ability of the rinse to maintain the loosened plaque or calculus materials in suspension in the rinse, enabling the user to finally discharge them from the mouth. Significantly, the plaque loosening effect of the rinse renders the plaque remaining on the dental surface far more amenable to removal during a subsequent brushing process. When the dental rinse is distinctly basic, as will be the case when sodium borate is employed, sodium bicarbonate is advantageously employed in combination with sodium borate, both for its detergent building properties, as well as for its buffering properties in an aqueous solution. In particular, an amount of sodium bicarbonate may be employed in an aqueous ethanolic, or aqueous ethanolic solvent base containing one or more distinctly basic ingredients e.g., sodium borate in order to adjust the dental rinse to the desired basic pH level discussed above. For example, when sodium borate is employed in the amounts stated above, sodium bicarbonate is preferably employed at levels ranging from about 0.1 to about 1.5 , and most preferably about 0.3 to about 1.0 by weight of the rinse formulation. As mentioned above, the pH of the dental rinse is 7.5 to 10, and may be adjusted to the desired pH with sodium bicarbonate or another buffer. The upper limit of the alkaline pH of the composition is limited by the possible irritative effects of strongly alkaline solutions in the oral cavity. Thus, the pH is not above 10.0, and most preferably is between about pH 8.0 to about 9.0. It has been found that unlike the commercial mouthwash formulations which have an acidic pH, the use of the dental rinse of this invention, comprising an alkaline solution of an oral surfactant and detergent builder, functions during an ordinary rinsing plus brushing regimen, to reduce the amount of plaque present on dental surfaces during the usage period. It has also been found that when sodium benzoate is employed in combination with the other ingredients of the dental rinse of this invention, the plaque loosening and retarding properties of the composition are significatnly enhanced. Thus, in a preferred embodiment of this invention, the dental rinse comprises an alkaline solution having a pH of 7.5 to 10, of a liquid solvent carrier selected from water, ethanol or mixtures thereof containing sodium borate, sodium lauryl sulfate, and sodium benzoate. The sodium benzoate is employed at a level of a least 1 by weight, and most preferably at least 2 by weight of the composition. Plaque consists of about 80 live bacteria in a polysaccharide matrix. Therefore, it is desirable for a dental rinse to possess significant antibacterial properties in order to eliminate or retard the growth of the bacterial colonies present in plaque. The relatively high levels of sodium benzoate employed in embodiments of this invention impart antiseptic properties to the formulation. Moreover, in order to advantageously enhance the antiseptic properties of the dental rinse formulations auxiliary antiseptics may be included in the formulation. Further, antiseptic properties may also be imparted to the dental rinse by the use of a liquid carrier comprised of ethanol or ethanol water, and or auxiliary antiseptics suitable for use in the oral cavity. A preferred, antibacterial and analgesic additive is sodium salicylate. It is believed that sodium salicylate is advantageously employed in the dental rinse formulation of this invention because it also functions to aid in the solubilization and removal of plaque from the dental surface In addition to, or in place of sodium salicylate, other oral antiseptics which are soluble in the liquid carrier i.e., water and or alcohol and which are compatible with other ingredients of the formulation may be employed, for example, benzetnonium chloride, N alkyl pyridinium chloride, N cetyl pyridinium bromide, sodium N lauroyl sarcosine, N myristoyl glycine and potassium N lauroyl sarcosine. The sodium salicylate or other analgesics preferably comprise about 0.1 to 1 , and most preferably, about 0.2 to about 0.5 by weight of the rinse. In addition to the foregoing ingredients, the dental rinse of this invention may include adjuvant ingredients effective to provide the desirable flavoring and coloring, and to impart the desired mouthfeel to the formulation. In further embodiments of this dental rinse, the flavorant employed is one which possesses antiseptic properties, e.g. a flavorant based upon thymol, eucalyptol and menthol. Thus, the formulation may include as combined antiseptic ingredients sodium benzoate, sodium salicylate and the above mentioned antiseptic flavorant or an equivalent antiseptic flavorant. The concentration of the flavorant is adjusted to impart the desired taste and or degree of antibacterial activity to the overall formulation. In further embodiments of the dental rinse formulation of this invention, effective amounts of one or more analgesics and or substances which promote wound healing, i.e., healing agents, are employed. To this end, sodium salicylate discussed above is particularly preferred because of its associated antiseptic and plaque solubilizing properties. The healing agent may be suitably employed at levels, of, for example, 0.1 to about 3 . The preferred healing agent for use herein is allantoin glyoxyl diuride . In particular, a combination of a soluble hydrocolloid e.g. xanthan gum , sodium salicylate and allantoin is advantageously employed for its combined wound healing analgesic properties. That combination of ingredients provides both a soothing effect to gums that may be irritated following brushing, and additionally may enhance the rate of gum healing due to the debriding and healing action of the allantoin. Sodium bicarbonate also promotes debridement and, hence, it is advantageously employed in the formulation of this invention for that purpose, as well as for the other reasons discussed above. The dental rinse of this invention may also contain ingredients such as glycerine in amounts up to 20 by weight, or, for example, 8 to 18 by weight. The glycerine functions as a sweetener, and also imparts body to the composition along with the alcohol or any gums present as well as the desired mouthfeel. Equivalent materials may be employed in place of, or in combination with, the glycerine such as sorbitol and or propylene glycol. The dental rinse is prepared by mixing the active ingredients together to form a homogeneous solution of the constituent ingredients. The rinse is used in a conventional manner that is, by applying a comfortable amount in the mouth, say one tablespoon full, and rinsing it about the dental surfaces. As illustrated by the appended example, a striking reduction in the amount of plaque on tooth surfaces is accomplished over a relatively brief usage period when the dental rinse of this invention is employed in conjunction with an ordinary tooth brushing regimen. The manner of making and using the present invention will be illustrated further by the following detailed examples. The following dental rinse was formulated A dry mix of the portion A 2 ingredients was prepared, and then slowly added to a mixture of the portion A 1 ingredients with high speed propeller agitation. Also under high speed agitation, the phase A 3 ingredients were individually added in the listed order, followed by the slow addition of a previously prepared mixture of Portion B to the phase A 1 3 mixture. The resultant dental rinse had a pleasing red appearance and an acceptable mouthfeel. The product was uniform in appearance and did not separate even after prolonged standing at room temperature. The pH of the dental rinse was 7.7. Four patients were administered the dental rinse of Example 1, and were instructed to use the rinse as follows All four test patients were examined prior to usage of the dental rinse Day 1 on chart below . Plaque area was monitored during the test period through the use of POH disclosing tablets in accordance with the standard Quigley Hein index. See G. A. Quigley and J. W. Hein, Comparative Cleaning Efficiency of Manual and Powered Brushing, J.Amer.Dent.Assn., Vol. 65 26 1962 . Gingival inflammation was measured by the Loe Silness Index See, Journal of Periodontology, Vol. 36, pg. 178 1965 , Loe, Theilades, Jensen , employing the Ranfjord Index which uses 6 teeth, numbers 3, 9, 12, 19, 25 and 28. The results are summarized in Table 1. The foregoing demonstrates that the dental rinse of this invention was an effective agent in significantly reducing both plaque and gingival inflammation over the test period, when used in a regular home dental care regimen. The following formulations were prepared A double blind study of the test formulations was conducted. Neither the dentist administering the test nor the patients who used the dental formulations set forth above knew any details about the composition of the rinse. Five patients were randomly chosen to use the red, five patients to use the green and five randomly chosen Patients to test the amber formulation. At the start of the test each patient was given an initial examination with plaque disclosure tablets. The plaque disclosure tablets contain a red dye which preferentially stains plaque but does not stain the clean enamel surfaces of the teeth. The percent surface areas of the inside and outside tooth surfaces covered with plaque were then estimated, tooth by tooth, by a dentist in accordance with the method of Quigley Hein, mentioned above. After the initial examination, five patients were given a bottle of the red formulation, five patients were given the green, and five patients the amber formulation. Each patient was instructed to rinse with the formulation they were given twice a day prior to brushing. The patients were each instructed to retain the rinse in their mouths for at least 30 seconds, moving it around in the mouth in order to insure that all of the tooth and gum surfaces were well soaked in the rinse. After completing the rinsing step, the patient was instructed to brush in accordance with his regular routine and using his own toothpaste. After seven days of use of the test formulation, the patients returned to the clinic for a reexamination of their dental surfaces in accordance with the same procedures employed at the start of the test. The results of the test are summarized in Table 2. The foregoing demonstrates the ability of the dental rinse of this invention to loosen, dislodge and retard the buildup of plaque when the dental rinse is employed prior to brushing. It is noted that in test formulations which did not include sodium benzoate, plaque was reduced by 13 over the test period, while the effect was unexpectedly enhanced to 72 82 in the sodium benzoate containing formulations. A dental rinse is formulated from the following components combined in the indicated weight percentages. This invention has been described in terms of specific embodiments set forth in detail herein, but it should be understood that these are by way of illustration and the invention is not necessarily limited thereto. Modifications and variations will be apparent from the disclosure and may be resorted to as those of skill in the art will readily understand. Accordingly, such variations and modifications are considered to be within the purview and scope of the invention and the following claims.
