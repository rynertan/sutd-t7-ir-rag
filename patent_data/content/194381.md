# Dielectric materials having low dielectric constants and methods for their manufacture.

## Abstract
Dielectric materials having low dielectric constant are provided, the materials comprising fabrics impregnated with theremosetting resins, at least a portion of the fibers in the fabrics being fluorocarbon fibers. Also provided is a method of manufacture of these dielectric materials. The dielectric materials are useful in the fabrication of multilayer printed circuit boards.
