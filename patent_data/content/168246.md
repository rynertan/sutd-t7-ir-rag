# Improved active pull up circuit.

## Abstract
An improved active pull up circuit which can be fabri cated with reduced number of elements and operate with a small power consumption. A first switch is provided between a refresh voltage terminal and a time circuit node to be pulled up. A second switch controlled by a potential of a complementary circuit node is provided for operatively discharging the charge of a control electrode of the first switch. A pull up clock is applied via a capacitor to the control electrode of the first switch.
