# Measuring machine.

## Abstract
The invention provides a measuring machine which includes a stationary measuring contact point 26 and a movable measuring contact point 28 , each of which is positioned so as to oppose each other. Measuring of an object to be measured is carried out by putting the object between the stationary measuring contact point 26 and the movable measuring contact point 28 . A spindle 30 carrying the movable measuring contact 28 is supported by a linear bearing of the crossed roller type. The linear bearing 100 supports the spindle in plural directions, and thereby the spindle in plural directions, and thereby the sliding motion of the spindle 30 can be carried out smoothly to obtain the precise measuring value.
