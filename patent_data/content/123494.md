# Determining the level of contaminants in a hydraulic system.

## Abstract
Apparatus and method for determining the level of par ticulate contamination within the fluid of a hydraulic system. System fluid is introduced through a non return valve 6, 115 into a space 11, 107a where it is contained by a piston 5, 101 . The structure of the piston includes relatively movable parts 5, 15 102, 104 defining a restricted orifice to which fluid, having passed through a drilling 17, 111 in the piston, may escape to drain. When the piston is moved so as to tend to diminish the trapped volume, fluid is expelled from the volume through the drilling and clearance until the clearance becomes blocked by contaminant. The degree of contamina tion may then be derived from the distance that the piston has moved. The separate parts of piston structure are then relatively moved to clear the orifice and allow the rest of the trapped fluid to escape, after which the orifice is reset and another volume of fluid introduced to be tested. The piston may be driven by reaction with the system fluid, or alterna tively by means 121 independent of that fluid. The specifica tion describes alternative means 4, 14, 13 122, 123 for measuring the distance travelled by the piston, and alterna tive piston structures to define the orifice, and alternative arrangements of the device as a whole 30, Figure 2 and 3 relative to the hydraulic system as a whole.
