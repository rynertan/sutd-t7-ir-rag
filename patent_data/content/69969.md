# Microwave alcohol fuel sensor.

## Abstract
A microwave alcohol fuel sensor comprises a micro wave oscillator 7 , a microwave receiver 9 and a micro wave transmission circuit connected to the oscillator and the receiver. The microwave transmission circuit comprises a dielectric substrate 3 and, a strip line 5 mounted on the substrate so that microwaves leak from the substrate to an alcohol gasoline fuel, and the microwaves attenuate by alcohol dielectric loss, whereby output voltage from the receiver corresponds to alcohol content rate. The dielectric substrate is formed tubular so that a constant amount of the fuel is fed the sensor.
