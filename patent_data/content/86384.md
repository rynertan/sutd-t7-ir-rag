# Method of heat treating a material having a carbon degradable content.

## Abstract
Heat treating of a material containing a carbon degrad able content is carried out by segmenting the temperature range of heat treating into at least two intervals, a first one of which is able to support heat treating without blistering of the material at a first maximum rate and a second one of which is able to support heat treating without blistering at a second maximum rate different from the first rate, and the material is heated at a first rate equal to or less than the first maximum rate in the first interval and at a second rate different from the first rate and equal to or less than the second maximum rate in the second interval.
