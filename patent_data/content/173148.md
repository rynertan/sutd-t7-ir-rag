# A LOGIC CIRCUIT

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a logic circuit which reduces occurrence of breakdown of a pull down transistor T₃ and a pull up transistor T₄ T₈ in the output stage when a high voltage is applied to the power supply line and ensures high voltage resistance. The logic circuit of the present invention controls the pull up transistor T₄ T₈ provided between a first power supply V
