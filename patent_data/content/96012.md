# Drive transmission device for motor vehicles.

## Abstract
A drive transmission device for use in a motor vehicle gear box with an expansible pulley stepless speed variator 14, 17 , employs a reverser unit including a pair of constant mesh gears 30, 31 for transmitting drive, in the opposite direction from that imparted by the pulleys 14, 17 , from the drive shaft 11 driven by the engine to the driven shaft 19 connected by gears 21, 22 to a crown wheel 24 of the differential 25 . The reverser unit 30, 31 is engaged for the transmission of reverse drive by the sliding of a sleeve 27 on the drive shaft 11 from a position in which it renders the shafts 11 rigid with the driving pulley 14 to a position in which it renders the shafts 11 rigid with the input gear 30 of the pair of gears 30, 31 .

## Description
Drive transmission device for motor vehicles The present invention relates to a device for transmitting drive from the drive shaft driven by the engine to the axle shafts of the driven wheels of a motor vehicle, of the type comprising a drive shaft driven by the engine driving shaft, a hollow main shaft rotatably mounted on the drive shaft and carrying an expansible driven pulley, a driven shaft carrying an expansible driven pulley which is driven by a V belt from the driving pulley for forward drive, hydraulically operated means for controlling the expansion of the driving and driven pulleys, a reverser unit for the transmission of reverse drive from the drive shaft to the driven shaft, an intermediate shaft having a gear meshed with a gear on the driven shaft, and a differential driven by the intermediate shaft and driving the axle shafts of the vehicle. The object of the present invention is to provide a drive transnl. s s i on device of the aforesaid type in which the reverser unit is of small bulk and limited cost, and solves, in a simple manner and with limited weight, the problem of having a fixed connection between the axle shafts and a driving shaft in an automatic gear box. In order to achieve this object, the present invention provides a drive transmlssion device of the aforesaid type, in which the reverser unit is constituted by an input gear carried br the drive shaft and freely rotatable thereon, an output gear carried rigidly by the driven shaft and constantly meshed with the input gear, a hub keyed onto the drive shaft and provided with a sleeve which is slidable between two positions in which the drive shaft is rendered rigid with the input gear for reverse drive, and rigid with the expansible driving pulley for forward drive, respectively, and means for displacing the slidable sleeve between the two positions. One embodiment of the present invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the single appended drawing which shows a device according to the invention partially sectioned alOng its lorgiti dina1 axjs Referring now to the drawing, a clutch unit 10 of a motor vehicle engine is connected to a drive shaft 11 which is rotatably mounted in kearnngs and is driven by the driving shaft not shown cf the engine through the clutch unit 10. A hollow main shaft 12 is mounted coaxially and rotatably on the drive shaft 11, and is formed in one piece with one half pulley 13 of an expansible driving pulley 14. The other half pulley 15 of the driving pulley 14 is keyed onto the shaft 12 so as to be axially slidable thereon. A V belt 16 connects the pulley 14 to the expansible driven pulley 17. One half pulley 18 of the driven pulley 17 is formed integrally with a driven shaft 19 rotatably mounted parallel to the shaft 11, and the other half pulley 20 is keyed to the shaft 19 for axial sliding movement thereon. A gear 21 formed on the shaft 19 is constantly meshed with the gear 22 of an intermediate shaft 23. The gear 22 is also meshed with the crown wheel 24 of the differential 25. On the drive shaft 11 is keyed a hub 26 provided with a sleeve 27 which is slidable by known means not shown between respective positions in which it renders the hub 26, and hence the shaft 11, rigid with a crown wheel 28 fixed to the main shaft 12 carrying the pulley 14, and with a crown wheel 29 formed in one piece with an input gear 30 mounted rotatably and coaxially on the drive shaft 11. The gear 30 is, in turn, constantly meshed with an output gear 31 keyed onto the driven shaft 19. The pair of gears 30, 31 with the crown wheels 28, 29, the hub 26, and the sleeve 27, together with the end parts of the shafts 11, 12, 19, are housed in a casing which is separate from the rest of the device. This casing is formed by the wall 32 of the housing for the pulleys 14, 17 and a lid 33 fixed thereto in known manner. The drive trasmission device described above operates as follows In order to achieve forward movement, it is necessary to slide the sleeve 27 into the position in which it meshes with the crown wheel 28, whereby drive is transmitted from the shaft 11 to the pulleys 14, 17, and the differential 25 is thus driven in the same sense as the shaft 11 through the driven shaft 19 and the intermediate shaft 23. If the sleeve 27 is displaced so that it meshes with the crown wheel 29, however, a reverse movement is achieved beca ise the driven shaft 19 rotates in the op posite sense from the shaft 11 due to the meshing of the gears 30, 31, and thus drives the intermediate shaft 23 and the differential 25 in this opposite sense.
