# Method for cross linking of agar products.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method for cross linking of agar products in an alkaline surrounding. According to the invention divinylsulfone is used as cross linking agent in a manner known per se. The cross linking is performed at room temperature at pH 11 in the presence of a reducing agent, and unreacted vinyl groups are deactivated by means of a neutral hydrophilic deactivating substance comprising several hydroxyl groups. The cross linking was stable even at a pH as high as 13 during a test period of 15 days.
