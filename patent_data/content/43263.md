The potted plants one pot per compound tested infested with 100 150 aphids, were placed on a revolving turntable and sprayed with 100 110 milliliters of test.comound formulation by use of a DeVilbiss spray gun set at 40 psig. air pressure. This application which lasted 25 seconds, was sufficient to wet the plants to run off. As a control, 100 110 milliliters of a water acetone emulsifier solution containing no test compound were also sprayed on infested plants. After spraying, the pots were placed on their sides on a sheet of white standard mimeograph paper which had been previously ruled to facilitate counting. Temperature and humidity in the test room during the 24 hour holding period were 65 700F. and 50 70 percent, respectively.Aphids which fell onto the paper and were unable to remain stanching after being uprighted were considered dead. Aphids remaining on the plants were observed closely for movement and those which were unable to move the length of the body upon stimulation by prodding were considered dead. Larvse of the southern armyworn Spodoptare eridania, Cram. , reared on Tendergreen bean plants at a temperature of 80 T 50F. and a relative humidity of 50 5 percent, constituted the test insects. The test compounds were formulated by diluring the stock suspension wit water to give a suspension con tailing 500 parts of test compound per million parts of final formulation. Potted Tendergreen bean plants of standard height and age were placed on a revolving turntable and sprayed with 100 110 milliliters of test compound formulation by use of a DeVilbiss spray gun set at 10 psig air prcssure.

Tne flies were immobilized by anesthetizing with carbon dioxide and twenty five immobilized individuals, males and females, were transferred to a cage consistirg of a standard food strainer about five inches in diameter which was inverted over a wrapping paper covered surfaceThe test compounds were formulated by diluting the stock suspension with a 10 percent by weight sugar solution to give a suspension containing 500 parts of test compoun per million parts of final formulation. by weight. Ten milliliters of the test formulation ere added to a souffle cup containing a one inch square of an absorbent cotton pad.This bait cut was introduced and centered on the blotting paper under the food strainer prior to admitting the anesthetized flies. The caged flies were allowed to feed on the bait for twenty four hours, at a temperature of 80 5 F. and the relative humidity of 50 5 percent. Flies which showed no sign of movement on prodding were considered dead. Adults and nymphal stages of the two spotted nite Tetranvchus urticae Koch , reared on Tendergreen bean plar.ts at 80 5 percent relative humidity, were the test organisms. Infested leaves from a stock culture were placed on the primary leaves of two bean plants six to eight inches in height, growing in a two and ahalf inch clay pot. 150 200 Mites, a sufficient nur ber for testing, transferred from the excised leaves to the fresh plants in a period of twenty four hours. Following the twenty four hour transfer period, the excised leaves were removed from the infested plants.The test compounds were formulated by diluting the stock suspension with water to give a suspension containing 500 parts of test compound per million parts of final formulation. lne potted plants one pot per compound were placed on a revolving turn table and sprayed with 100 110 milliliters o test compound formulation b use of a DeVilbiss spray gun set at 40 psig. air pressure.

The compounds contemplated in this invention may be applied as mite ovicides and miticides according to methods known to those skilled in the art. Pesticidal compositions containing the compounds as the sctive toxicant will usually comprise a carrier and or diluent, either liquid or solid. Suitable liquid diluents or carriers include water, petroleum distillates, or other liquid carriers with or without surface active agents. Liquid concentrates may be prepared by dissolving one of these compounds wir a nonphytotoxic solvent such as acetone, xylene, or nitrobenzene and dispersing the toxicants in water with the aid of suitable surface active emulsifying ano dispersing agents. The choice of dispersing and emulsifying agents and the amount employed is dictated by the a ure of the composition and the ability of the agent to facilitate the dispersion of the toxicanc. Generally, it is desirable to use as little of the agent as is possible, consistent with the desired dispersion of the toxicant in the spray so that rain does not reemulsify the toxicant after it is applied to the plant and wash it off the plant.Nonionic, anionic, amphoteric or cationic dispersing and emulsifying agents may be employed for example, the condensation products of alkylerie oxides with phenol and organic acids, alkyl aryl sulfonates, complex ether alcohols, quaternary ammonium compounds, and the like. In the preparation of wettable powder or dust or granulated compositions, the active ingredient is dispersed in and on an appropriately divide solid carrier such as clay, talc, bentonite, diatomaceous earth.fullers earth, and the like. In the formulation of the wettable powders the aforementioned dispersing agents as well as lignosulfonates can be included. The recuired amount of, the toxicants contemplated herein may be applied per acre treated in from 1 to 200 gallons or more of liquid carrier and or diluent or in from about 5 to 500 pounds of inert solid carrier and or diluent. The concentration in the liquid concenrate will usually very from about 10. to 95 percent by weight and in the solid formulations from about 0.5 to about 90 percent by weight. Satisfactory sprays, dusts, or granules for general use contain from about 1 4 to 15 pounds of active toxicant per acre. The pesticides contemplated herein prevent attack by insects and mites upon plants or other material to which the pesticides are applied, and they have relatively high residual toxicity. With respect to plants, they have a high margin of safety in that when usec in sufficient amount to kill or repel the insects, they co not burn or injure the plant, and they resist weathering which includes wash off caused by rain, decomposition b ultraviolet iight, oxidation, or hydrolysis in the presence of moisture or, at least such decomposition, oxidation, and hydrolysis as would materially decrease the desirable pesticidal characteristic of the toxicants or impart undesirable characteristic for instance, phytotoxicity, to the toxicants. The toxicants are so chemically inert that they are compatible with substantially an other constituents of the spray schdule, and they may be used in the soil, upon the seeds, or the roots o plants without injuring either the seeds or roots of plants. They may also be used in combination with other pesticidally active compounds. When used as miticides they will normally be applied to the foliage of the plants to be treated. It will be appreciated that the compounds of this invention can also be used in combination with other biologically active compounds.
