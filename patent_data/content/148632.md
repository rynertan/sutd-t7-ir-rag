# IONOMERS WITH IMPROVED LOW TEMPERATURE FLEX CRACK RESISTANCE AND IMPROVED PROCESS ECONOMICS

## Abstract
Improved low temperature flex crack resistant ionic copo lymers of ethylene, unsaturated carboxylic acid and at least one softening comonomer that is capable of forming a homo polymer having a glass transition temperature of less than 40 C, such as alkyl acrylates and or alkyl vinyl ethers and from about 0.5 to about 6.0 mole of chain branches arising from the polymerization of ethylene, are obtained by direct or graft copolymerization, followed by neutralization of the car boxylic acid groups with metal ions, such ionic copolymers of ethylene being characterized by having from about 5 to about 20 chain branches arising from the polymerization of ethylene 1000 CHâ‚‚ units of the polymer backbone, said ethy lene chain branches being composed of butyl or longer bran ches, the copolymer being further characterized by satisfying the equation A 2.05 B C, wherein A is the mole percent of softening comonomer, B is the mole percent of butyl or longer chain branches derived from the polymerization of ethy lene, and C is from about 1.5 to about 24.3.
