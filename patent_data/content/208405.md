## Description
RARE EARTH OXHYDRIDES AND PROCESSES FOR THEIR PRODUCTION The present invention relates to rare earth oxyhydrides and processes for their production. It is known that the rare earth elements Re fori intermetallic compounds, hereinafter to be referred to as ICREe, which may be used as catalysts in a variety of chemical reactions.A large number of ICREs are shown. Recently, a new class of ICREs in which the rare earth element is associated with nickel has been discovered. These ICREs includeLaNi5, LaNi2 and CeNi5. Lanes was used by Coon et al, J. Phys.Chem., 1976, 80, 1878 for the conversion of carbon monoxideihydrogen mixtures into methane at a temperature above 225 C. According to an article by W.E. Wallace in Chemtech, December 1982, pages 752 to 754, Lands acts as a catalyst in its oxidised form in which nodules of nickel of a small diameter are to be found in an La203 support.Wallace distinguishes between three types of catalyst obtained from Lands, viz a type 0 obtained by calcining 18203 by the wet route, b type I obtained by oxidising La203 by synthesis gas, i.e. mixtures of gases essentially comprising carbon monoxide and hydrogen, and c type II obtained by oxidi9ing La203 by means of oxygen. These oxidised catalysts of Type 0, I and II make it possible to produce methane from synthesis gas. The aforesaid ICREs can fix hydrogen in a reversible manner, under moderate conditions of temperature and pressure giving rise to hydrides, see for example GB A 1546612. Those hydrides are known basically in three for, viz. the alpha phase containing less than 1 hydrogen atoms per crystallographic lattice, the beta phase containing 6 to 7 atoms of hydrogen per crystallographic lattice and the mixture of the alpha and beta phases. ICRE hydrides of the aforesaid type have been used as hydrogenation catalysts, in particular for the synthesis of ammonia see Takeshita T,Wallace W.E., Craig R.S. in J. Catal., 1976, 44, 236 . During the course of our research on catalysts we have produced suprisingly hydrldes of oxidised ICREs, hereinafter to be referred to as oxyhydrides, which compounds are believed to be novel. Accordingly, the present invention provides rare earth oxyhydrides of the formula I R qGqNi5 pMpOySzc I wherein RE is a rare earth element or a mixture of rare earth elements, G is either Th and or Y, M is at least one of Cu, Mn, Al, Pe, Cr or Co, q is zero or a number less than 1, p is zero or a number less than 5, y is an integer or decimal number from 0.4 to 6.5, and x is an integer or a decimal number equal to or less than 15. By rare earth elements is meant the elements from lanthanum Atomic No. 57 to lutetium Atomic No. 71 , and mixtures thereof.Amongst such mixtures, a mixture generally referred to as Mischmetal HEn , which is a mixture of rare earth elements of a composition depending upon the supplier, is preferred. The most commonMischmetal comprises rare earth elements in the proportion by weight La 23X, Ce 47Z, Pr 5X, Nd 18X, the remainder of the mixture up to 100 consisting of other rare earth elements.Attention is drawn to the high content of Ce in the aforesaid mixture. In the formula I , y is an integer or decimal number preferably in the range from 1 to 3.5 and x is an integer or decimal number preferably in the range from 1 to 8. amongst the preferred rare earth oxyhydrides are those of the formulae II to VII as follows N Ni5OyHx II wherein Mm is a Mischmetal, CeNi5OyHx III CeNi5 kMkOyHx IV Ce1 sNi5GsOyHx V MmNi5 kMkOyHx VI and Mm1 sNi5GsOyHx VII In the formulae II to VII above, G, M, y and x have the meanings assigned above, k is zero or an integer or a decimal number less than 5 and s is zero or a number less than 1. The rare earth oxyhydrides according to the present invention may also be supported. Suitable supports include alumina, silica alumina, carbon, and the like. In another aspect the present invention also provides processes for the production of rare earth oxyhydrides of the formula I . One process for the production of a rare earth oxhydride of the formula I comprises subjecting in a first stage an intermetallic compound of the formula VIII RE1 qGqNi5 pMp VIII in a closed reactor, preferably an autoclave, to a plurality of hydriding dehydriding cycles, the hydriding being performed under a hydrogen pressure of from 20 to 200, preferably from 100 to 150 bar and at a temperature of from 200C to below 450 C and the dehydriding being performed in the same closed reactor at a temperature in the range from 20 to 4300C in a second stage proceeding to static compression under an atmosphere of hydrogen by raising the temperature incrementally until a pressure in the range from S to 25 MPa 50 to 250 bar is attained, and in a third stage performing a limited oxidation by bringing the compound obtained in the second stage into contact with an oxygen containing gas or a gaseous oxidant at a temperature in the range from ambient to less than 450it for a period of about 4 hours to about 200 hours. In the first stage of the aforesaid process the hydriding is performed under a hydrogen pressure of from 20 to 200 bar, preferably from 100 to 150 bar and at a temperature of from 200C to below 4500C. The hydrogen pressure may be maintained by compensating for the quantity of hydrogen absorbed by the alloy. To effect dehydriding, the closed reaction vessel may suitably be placed under vacuum and re heated to the temperature at which hydriding was performed, i.e. a temperature in the range from 20 C to below 4500C. After the second hydriding cycle, the fixation of hydrogen is easier and the pressure may be decreased. The hydriding dehydriding may suitably be performed on alloys in lump or block form, which thereafter disintegrate. The specific surface area of the powder formed is observed to increase with the number of hydriding dehydriding cycles. It is preferred to perform from 4 to 20 cycles. In the second stage the operation known as static compression is effected. This operation probably increases the active surface area of the material. Typically, the powder obtained in the first stage is subjected to a hydrogen pressure of from 50 to 250 bar for a period sufficient to achieve pressure stabilisation, which may be several hours. The temperature is raised incrementally, for example by increments of 250C every 20 minutes, up to a maximum temperature which may reach a temperature below 4500C, depending on the nature of the alloy employed. Thus, for example, for Lanes the static compression corresponds to a maximum temperature of 150 to 2500C and a pressure of 150 to 200 bar. In the case of MmNis, the maximum temperature varies from 200 to 4000C and the hydrogen pressure from 140 to 250 bar approximately. In this way an ICRE hydride of the beta phase is obtained, that is to say a hydride rich in hydrogen. The equilibrium pressure at the compression stages depends on the nature of the hydride in question. In the third stage, typically an abrupt decompression of the closed reactor is effected, placing it in coumunlcatlon with an oxygen containing gas or a gaseous oxidant, at a temperature which is that of maximum compression, that is to say which may vary from 150 to 4500C. This temperature oay be termed the initial temperature To . Oxidation is effected at a temperature in the range from ambient to 450 C, preferably from 20 to 4000C. In other words, the hydride obtained in the second stage is either allowed to cool in contact with the oxygen containing gas or gaseous oxidant at ambient temperature or else the aforesaid gas is heated to a temperature below 4500C.The final temperature Tf is the temperature at the end of the oxidation treatment which lasts from about 4 hours to about 200 hours, preferably from 24 to 132 hours. The oxygen containing gas may be richer or poorer in molecular oxygen than air. Thus, there may be used, for example, oxygen or air, preferably air. Other gaseous oxitants may be employed if desired. The quantity of oxygen fixed, that is to say the value of y in formula I varies from about 0.7 to about 3 depending on the temperature of the oxidation stage. Generally, the value of y increases with the temperature at which the oxidation is performed.Thus, for example, for Lands y is approximately 0.7 to 0.8 when the air used as oxidant is at a temperature from 20 to 25eC y has a value of about 1.9 when the temperature of the air used as oxidant is about 3000C. When the air temperature is raised to 500 C, combustion with complete oxidation is achieved in the space of 3 hours and the value of y is then about 6.5. A second process for the production of rare earth oxyhydrides of the formula I comprises in a first step forging a solution comprising soluble salts of nickel and the other metallic element s thermally decomposable to the oxides thereof in such proportions as to satisfy the stoichiometric relationship of formula I , in a second step precipitating a mixture of the thermally decomposable salts of nickel and the other metallic element s , in a third step partially or wholly thermally decomposing the mixture of heat decomposable salts obtained it the second step, end in a fourth step reducing the product obtained in the third step in the presence of hydrogen. As regards the first step, the solution may suitably be formed by dissolving the salts of the metals thermally decomposable to their oxides in appropriate proportions in a suitable solvent, for example water. A preferred method of forming the solution, however, comprises reacting the rare earth intermetallic compound with a suitable acid. In this manner the solution so obtained has the stoichiometry dictated by the formula I . A preferred a a it thermally decomposable to the oxide is the nitrate, though other salts may be employed. Thus it is preferred, in the preferred method of performing step I to react tit ICRE with aqueous nitric acid. Precipitation of a mixture of the thermally decomposable salts may be achieved in a variety of ways. A suitable method is td evaporate three solution until tile salts precipitate but It preferred, thereafter, to dry the precipitate so obtained. This step may suitably be effected in the presence of a support, for example alumina, silica alumina, carbon, or the like. In this way it ilas being found possible to product, for example, LaNi5O1.7H10 supported on alumina. In the third step the mixture of heat decomposable salts is partially or wholly decomposed. Partial decomposition may suitably be achieved in the case of nitrate salts, for example, by calcination at a temperature in the range from 306 to 800 C for a period sufficient to achieve partial decomposition, e.g. 15 hours.Total decomposition may suitably be achieved by calcination at 8000C for a period sufficient to achieve total decomposition, e.g. 15 hours. In the fourth step the product obtained in the third step is reduced in the presence of hydrogen undar appropriate conditions, for example at 300 C under atmospheric pressure. The oxyhydride obtained by calcination at 400 C i.e. still containing some nitrates and subsequent reduction at 300 C under hydrogen at atmospheric pressure conformed to the stoichiometry MmNi5O1.7 w WO3 2wHxThis stoichiometry was calculated by mass balance from thermogravimetric data. This oxyhydride is somewhat unique in that it has a specific surface area of approximately 20m2 g, whilst the oxyhydrides prepared by other methods generally have surface areas of less than 10m2 8. A third process for the production of rare earth oxyhydrides of the formula I comprises in a first stage subjecting an intermetallic compound of the formule VIII in a closed reaction vessel, preferably an autoclave, to a plurality of hydriding dehydriding cycles, the hydriding being performed under a hydrogen pressure of from 20 to 200, preferably from 100 to 150 bar and at a temperature of from 20 C to below 450 C and the dehydriding being performed in the same closed reactor at a temperature in the range from 20 to 450 C, in a second stage oxidising the hydride of the intermetallic compound obtained in the first stage, and in a third stage chemically reducing the product obtained in the second stage to produce the rare earth oxyhydride. The first stage may suitably be operated in the manner as described previously for the first stage of the first process for the production of the rare earth oxyhydrides of the invention. The second stage may suitably be accomplished by heating the intermetallic compound hydride from the first stage in the presence of a gaseous oxidant, for example air, suitably in a muffle furnace or tube furnace with a current or O2 N2 for 15 hours at 400 C. The oxidised product from the second stage may suitably be reduced in a batch reactor or under a flow of H2 at atmospheric pressure and at 300 C. The invention will now be further illustrated by reference to the following Examples in which the ICRE is either LaNi5 or MmNi5. The following Table shows respectively the ICRE employed as initial material for the preparation of the oxyhydride HY STOR, designates the supplier of MmNi5 and LaNi5 the characteristics of the three stages in the preparation of the oxyhydride.

The hydriding was performed in 5 cycles at 4000C and under 150 bars. The compound obtained was MmNi5H6. This hydride was then oxidised under air muffle furnace or tube furnace with a current of 02 N2 for 15 hours at 400 C The compound became MiNi506.76. This oxide was then reduced in a batch reactor or under a flow of H2 at atmospheric pressure and at 300 C. There was obtained the oxyhydride MmNi5O1.76H8. Example 5PREPARATION OF AN OXHYDRIDE FROM NICKEL NITRATE AND RARE EARTHS This method is based on the production of a solution of nickel nitrates and rare earth. Two possibilities exist 1. Making a solution of the salts in question, adhering to stoichiometry so as to obtain 8 ratio of Ni Mb 5. 2. By attacking metallic MmNi5 with HNO3 in this way one obtains good stoichiometry direct . The nitrates solution was then concentrated by evaporating the solution spproximately 800C until the nitrates precipitated out.The precipitate was then dried and partially decomposed under a hood NO2 given off . The black residue was than calcined at 4000C 15 hours . If one wants to ensure total oxidation, that is to say total elimination of the nitrates, it is necessary to calcine the precipitate at 8000C 15 hours . In all cases reduction under H2 at 300 C under atmospheric pressure gave an oxhydride. The oxyhydride prepared by calcination at 400 C and subsequent reduction at 300çC under hydrogen at atmospheric pressure still having some nitrates gave stoichiometry of MmNi5O1.7 w NO3 2wH8. This oxyhydride have the peculiar feature of having a specific surface area of approximately 20 m2 g, whilst the oxhydrides prepared by other methods always gave specific surface areas of less than 10 m2 g. Moreover, this oxyhydride proved very active in the hydrogenation of isoprene.
