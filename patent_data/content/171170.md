# MICROWAVE OVEN

## Abstract
A microwave oven has a standard control circuit 1 and magnetron 2 . To enable the oven to operate from a 24V d.c. battery power supply 9 , such as that of a lorry, car, etc., the oven includes a 50 Hz inverter 11 and a transformer 12 for generating an a.c. power supply of mains frequency and volt age to drive a fan motor 5 and a timer motor 7 in the circuit 1 , and a 150 Hz inverter 13 and another transformer 20 for generating an a.c. power supply of higher frequency and differ ent voltages to drive the magnetron 2 and its associated heat er 10 . The oven also includes a battery sensing circuit 17 , which senses fluctuations in the battery voltage level and a control 18 adjusts current to the magnetron 2 accordingly. The control 18 also de energises the magnetron 2 if the bat tery voltage level goes low.
