# DECORATION OF WALL TILES

## Abstract
According to the present invention, a ceramic tile is provided with a glaze or other coating which is capable of absorbing on into or through its surface an image formed from dyes, such as emulsion dye colourings, or other im age forming material. The invention thus provides a method of decorating a ceramic tile wherein the decorative image is applied on into or through the glaze on or penetrating the tile, the glaze being formulated to absorb and retain the image. The image may be applied on or into the glaze or other tile coating from an image carrier preferably by colour transfer molecule bonding.
