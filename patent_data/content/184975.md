# Rotor thrust balancing.

## Abstract
A turbine construction in which the axial loading on the rotor including the compressor and turbine resulting from cooling air pressure in the compartment 64 between the compressor and turbine is balanced by making the com pressor and turbine areas exposed to the cooling air of equal area as by having the seals 32, 63 at compressor and tur bine ends of the compartment 64 equal in radius with re spect to the air of the rotor.
