# Ceramic honeycomb filters and the production thereof.

## Abstract
A ceramic honeycomb filter comprises of a porous ceramic structural body 1 having a plurality of channels 2 extending therethrough from one end face thereof to another end face thereof, wherein given channels 2 at one of the end faces having sealing portions 4 formed by bending and bonding the partition walls 3 defining the end portions of the channels, and the remaining channels have sealing portions formed by bending and bonding the parti tion walls at the other end portions of the channels. The filter is produced from a plastic ceramic honeycomb body by appropriately deforming the partition walls at the end faces of the body, e.g. by means of rods having tapered tips, and subsequently firing the body.
