# Reverse jet scrubber apparatus and method of scrubbing a gas stream.

## Abstract
A reverse jet scrubber apparatus and method for remov ing gaseous contaminants, such as sulfur dioxide, and par ticulate matter from a combustion gas stream, employing low energy and reduced amounts of scrubbing liquid, uses a plur ality of jet spray nozzles 18,20 centrally disposed and spaced apart from each other along an elongated conduit 12 to spray a caustic scrubbing liquid under high pressure counter currently into a high velocity, combustion gas stream, to form separate spray scrubbing zones 28, 30 covering the cross sectional area of the conduit, whereby a combustion gas stream is scrubbed and a clear gas stream is recovered down stream of the scrubbing zones. Preferably means 22,24 are provided for wetting the interior wall of the conduit with a film 26 of scrubbing liquid upstream of the scrubbing zones.
