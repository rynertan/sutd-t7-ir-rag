# Process for preparing calcium silicate shaped product.

## Abstract
A calcium silicate shaped product is prepared by forming an aqueous slurry of calcium silicate hydrate by reacting a calcareous source with a siliceous source in water as a disper sion under heating molding said aqueous slurry to form a molded product having a bulk density of less than 0.6 g cmÂ³ curing said molded product, in a closed tank having a capacity of 1.5 to 30 times of the volume of said molded product at 140 to 300 C by dry heating without feeding steam, and drying the product.
