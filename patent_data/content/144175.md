STABILIZED THERMOPLASTIC ELASTOMER COMPOSITIONS Backcround of the Tnvention Thermoplastic copolyester elastomers in which the polyester is modified with long rubbery segments have long been known in the art and are used in the preparation of molded and extruded articles. Such resins can be used alone or in conjunction with fillers or other resins to provide materials having a variety cf properties.

In further preferred embodiments of the in vent on, at least about 80 of the R groups of formulasI and II are hydrocarbon radicals remaining after re moval Gf carboxyl groups from terephthalic acid, between about 10 and about 40 , more usually between about 20 and about 30 , of the D groups of Formula II repre sent divalent radicals remaining after removal of hy droxyl groups from 1,4 butenediol and short chain its amount to between about 40 and about 65E bv weight of the copolyester. Detailed Description of the Invention The long chain ester units of the product of the invention are the reaction product of a long chain glycol with terephthalic acid or isophthalic acid. The long chain glycols are poly alkylene oxide glvcols having terminal or as nearly terminal as pos sible hydroxyl groups and hydroxyl numbers between about 18 and about 280 as determined in accordance wit ASTM test method E 222. Corresponding number average molecular weights are between about 400 and about 6,000. Number average molecular weight for a particular glycol may be calculated by dividing the hydroxyl number into 112,200. Glycols used in the invention preferably have a number average molecular weight between about 400 and about 6,000 as carbon to oxygen ratio of between about 2.0 to 1 and about 4.3 to 1.Representative long chain glycols available for use in making product of the invention include poly ethylene oxide glycol, poly l,2 and 1,3 propylene oxide glycol, and poly tetramethylene oxide glycol. Poly tetramethylene oxide glycol is a particularly preferred glycol for long chain ester units of the invent ion. Short chain units of product of tre invention may be made by reacting 1,4 butanediol, 1,4 butenediol or a mixture thereof with terephthalic acid or isoph thalic acid. In preferred embodiments l,4 butenedio is used in amounts between about 10 and about 40 , more usually between about 20 and about 30 , based on the total of 1,4 butaneciol and 1,4 butenediol. In making both the long chain and short chain units of product of the invention, the use of terephthalic acid is generally preferred with tre use cf between about 1 and about 20 isophthalic acid based on the total of terephthalic acid and isophthalic acid used being preferred when product of lower flexural modulus is desired. The terms terephthalic acid and isophthalic acid as used herein are intended to include the conden sat ion polymerization equivalent of such acids, i.e.their esters or ester forming derivatives such as acid chlorides and anhydrides, or other derivatives which behave substantially like such acids in a polymerization reaction with a glycol. Dimethyl terephthalate and dimethyl isophthalate are for instance suitable starting materials for elastomers of the invention. Copolyester elastomer for use in the invention can be made by conventional ester interchange reaction.A preferred procedure involves heating the dimethyl ester of terephthalic acid or of a mixture of terephthalic and isophthalic acids with a long chain glycol and a molar excess of a mixture of butanediol and butenediol in the presence of a catalyst at 150 260 0C followed by distilling off of methanol formed by the interchange. Heating is continued until methanol evolution is complete. Depending upon temperature, catalyst and glycol excess, the polymerization is complete within a few minutes to a few hours.This procedure results in the preparatIon of a low molecular weight pre polymer which can be carried to a desired high molecular weight copolyester by distillation cf the excess of snort chain diol in a conventional polycondensation reaction. Additional ester interchange occurs during this distilla tion to increase the molecular weight and to randomize the arrangement of the copolyester units. Best results are usually obtained if this final distillation cr polycondensation is run at less than 1 mm pressure and 220 255 C for less than 2 hours in e presence of antioxidants. Most practical polymerization tech n rot es rely upon ester interchange t complete the polyrerization reaction.In ormer to avoid excessive hcld time at high temperatures with possible irreversible thermal degradation, it is advantageous to employ a catalyst for ester interchange reactlcns. While a wide variety of catalysts can be used, organic tltanates such 25 tetrabutyl or tetraisopropyl titanate used alone or in combination with magnesium or calcium acetates are preferred. Complex titanates, such as derived from alkali or alkaline earth metal alkoxides and titanate esters are also very effective. Inorganic titanates, such as lanthanum titanate, calcium acetate antimony trioxide mixtures and lithium and magnesium alkcxides are representative of other catalysts which can be used. Prepolymers for product of the invention can also be prepared by a number of alternate esterification or ester interchange processes. Por example, the long chain glycol can be reacted with a high or low molecular weight short chain ester homopolymer or copolymer in the presence of catalyst until randomization occurs. The short chain ester homopolymer or copolymer can be prepared by ester interchange from either the dimethyl esters and low molecular weight diols, as above, or from the free acids with the diol acetates. Alternatively, the short chain ester Co polymer can be prepared by direct esterification from appropriate acids, anhydrides or acid chlorines, for example, with diols or by other processes such as reaction of the acids with cyclic ethers or carbonates. Obviously the prepolymer might also be prepared by running these processes in the presence of the long chain glycol. Ester Interchange polymerizations are generally run in the melt without adder solvent, but invert solvents can be used to facilitate removal of volatile components from the mass at low temperatures. This technlcue is especially valuable during prepolymer preparation, for example, by direct esterification. However, certain low molecular weight diols, for example, butanediol in terphenyl, are conveniently removed during high polymerization by azeotropic distillation.Other special polymerization techniques, for example, interfacial polymerization of bisphenol with bisacylhalides and bisacylhalide capped linear diols, may prove useful for preparation of specific polymers. Both batch and continuous methods can be used for any stage of Co polyester polymer preparation. Polycondensation of prepolymer can also be accomplished in the solid phase by heating finely divided solid prepclymer in a vacuum or in a stream of inert gas to remove liberated low molecular weight diol. This method has the advantage of reducing degradation because it must be used at temperatures below the softening point of the prepolymer.The major disadvantage is the long time required to reach a given degree of polymerization. Molecular weight of elastomer used in product of the invention may vary widely depending upon end use requirements. For elastomer used in product of the invention melt flow rate MFR is usually used as an indication of molecular weight. The actual molec ular weight of the elastomer is not usually determined.For typical uses of product of the invention such as extrusion or molding operations elastomer used tre quently has an MFR between about 0.1 and about 50 grams 1C minutes 2200C, 21609 as determined in accordance with ASTM test method D 1238 although elastomer of greater MFR such as up to about 350 or more may be produced if desired. Elastomer composition of tne invention ccnt rns between about 0.1 and about 25 weight percent wt polyvinylpyrrolidone PVP based on copolyester, preferably between about 0.5 and about 15 wt cn the sa e basis. While molecular weight of PVP used in the Invention is not critical as long as the PVP cces not produce discrete particles in the blend, use of PVP having a K value not exceeding about 30 is ore erred. PVP having a K value between about 0.5 and about 20 is especially preferred. K values mentioned herein are as determined by the Fikentscher equation Kline, G.M., Polyvinylpyrrolidone , Modern Plastics, Nov., 1945 . Elastomer of the invention preferably also contains between about 0.05 and about 5 wt based on polyester of cyanoguanidine CNG EMI9.1 or of guanidine stabilizer of the general formulaEMI10.1 Formula III where n is an integer between 2 and about 20, preferably 5 or 6. Use of this type of stabilizer improves long term thermal stability of the elastomer. Use of cyanoguanidine or stabilizer of Formula III in which n is 6, i.e. 1,6 Hexamethylene bis dicyandiamide F3D is especially preferred. In preferred embodiments, elastomer composition of the invention also includes between about 0.1 and about 5 by weight of said copolyester of c rphenylamine derivative of the general formula Formula IVEMI10.2 where R and R1 are methyl or phenyl. Preferred embodiments of the invention also include between about 0.05 and about 38 by weight of said copolyester of phosphorus compound of one or more of the formulas EMI10.3 tb 4 SEP SEP SEP X SEP t tb SEP Formula SEP V tb where t represents a tertiary butyl radical Formula VIEMI11.1 where R represents an alkyl radical having from 6 to about 22 carbon atoms or a hydrocarbon radical of the structureEMI11.2 where t represents a tertiary butyl radical orEMI11.3 Formula VII where each of R and R1 independently represents a hydrocarbon radical selected from the group consisting of alkyl, aryl and alkyl aryl hydrocarbon radicals having from 1 to about 22 carbon atoms and R3 represents hydrogen or a hydrocarbon radical selected from the group consisting of alkyl, aryl and alkyl aryl hydrocarbon radicals having from 1 to about 22 carbon atoms. Addition of these ingredients provides further unexpected improvement in thermal stability of elastomer of the invent ion. Phosphorous compounds of Formula VI suitable for use in the invention include for instance distearyl pentaerythritol diphosphite dioctyl pentaerythr itol diphosphite diisodecyl pentaerylthritol diphosphite dimyristyl pentaerythritol diphosphite bis 2,4 di t butyl phenyl pentaerythritol diphosphiteOf these the use of distearyl pentaerythritol diphosphite or bis 2,4 di t butyl phenyl pentaerythritol dihosphite is preferred. Suitable phosphorous compounds of Formula VII for use in the invention include for instance tris nonyl phenyl phosphite tris butyl phenyl phosphite trimethyl phosphite triethyl phosphite tris 2 ethylhexyl phosphite triisopropyl phosphite triisoctyl phosphite diisoctyl phosphite distearyl phcsphite triisodecyl phosphite triisoctyl phosphite trilauryl phosphite tristearyl phosphite diphenyl phosphite tr iphenyl phosphite diphenyl isodecyl phosphite diphenyl isooctyl phosphite phenyl isodecyl phosphite dilauryl phosphite di tridecyl phosphite ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphite diisoctyl octylphenyl phosphite phenyl diisodecyl phosphiteOf these, use of tris nonyl phenyl phosphite or phenyl diisodecyl phosphite is frequently preferred. Small amounts of antioxidant stabilizer, such as between about 0.1 and about 5 wt based on copolyester, are preferably included with the ingredients used in making copolyester for use in the invention.It is preferred that at least this small amount of antioxidant be present during polymerization of the copolyester in order to prevent excessive oxidation.Antioxidant consisting of 3,4 di tert butyl 4 hydroxy hydrocinnamic acid triester with 1,3,5 tris 2 hydroxy ethyl s triazine 2,4,6 1H, 3H, 5H trione is preferred but other suitable stabilizers may be used. Compositions of the invention may include additional conventional ingredients such as UV absorbers, e.g. benzophenones or benzotr iazoles . The prcpertres cf these ccrrpcsitions can also be modified by incorpora tion of various conventional inorganic fillers such as carbon black, silica gel, alumina, clays and chcpped fiberglass. In general, these additives have the effect of increasing the modulus cf the material at various elongations. Compounds having a range cf hardness values can be obtained by blending hard and soft copolyesters of the invention.The copolyesters can also be compounded with other resins such as pclvvinyl chloride or polybutylene terephthalate. Suitable flame retardant additives may also be used. As mentioned above, at least small amounts of antioxidant are preferably used during polymerization of copolyester of the invention. Other essential and optional ingredients of compositions of the invention are preferably added by blending with previously polymer ized copolyester. All such ingredients or portions thereof may, however, be present during polymerization of the copolyester so long as the polymerization reaction is not interfered with. Blending with copolyester may be carried out in any suitable manner such as in conventional mixing equipment with extrusion compounding being preferred. Elastomers of the invention exhibit superior retention of mechanical properties, especially tensile strength, and improved brittleness characteristics at elevated temperatures. Such elastomers are especially suited for use in molding various articles such as tires, hoses, drive belts, gears, etc. Such elastomers can be made in grades of low melt flow rate. This permits faster molding cycle times and allows the manr facture of blow molding grades of elastomers of the invention. Both cyanoguanidine CNG and guanicine stafri lizers of formula III are quite effective for stabilizing elastomer of the type used in the invention. CNG will, however, plate out onto extrusion processing equipment. This results in extruded parts which have dull surfaces. Guanidine stabilizers of formula III tend to bloom, resulting in dull, greasy appearing surfaces on rnished products. Use of PVP along with CNG or stabilizer of formula III in compositions of the inventicn sub stantially eliminates such plate out or blooming and resulting dull surfaces on extruded products. it has further been found that PVP alone has a significant stabilizing influence on elastomers of the type described herein. Stability of elastomers of this type containingPVP or PVP plus guanidine is further improved by the use of diphenylamine and phosphorous stabilizer as described herein.
