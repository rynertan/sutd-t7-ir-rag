# Image processing device for the real time processing and recognition of two dimensional images, and image processing system including at least two series connected image processing devices of this kind.

## Abstract
An image processing device for two dimensional raster images is described. The receiving means thereof are followed by a sub sampling circuit 28 for increasing the pitch of the raster received in accordance with an adjustable scale. To the sub sampling circuit there are connected a buffer 30, 32 and a correlation circuit 36, 38 for comparing a number of columns of pixels with a reference image. The comparison result is subjected to a logic operation. The device is suitable for modular use and may include a growth circuit for converting rasters portions into one colour or brightness when a predetermined minimum number of pixels therein contains the relevant colour or brightness, respectively.
