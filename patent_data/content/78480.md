# METHOD FOR FUSING AND CONNECTING SOLDER OF IC CHIP

## Abstract
Disclosed is a method for solder fusing and connecting an IC chip which comprises locating solder bumps for elec tric connection, disposed on an IC chip, and a metallic layer for controlling the shape of connecting portions, disposed on the IC chip having said solder bumps and having a melting point higher than the melting point of the solder bumps, to terminals for electric connection and to terminals for controlling the shape of the connecting portions, dis posed on a substrate, respectively heat fusing the solder bumps to form the connecting portions having the swelling shape at the center and heat fusing the metallic layer at a higher temperature to form bumps for controlling the shape of connecting portions, having the swelling shape at the center, and changing the connecting portions having the swelling shape at the center to connecting portions having the contracted shape at the center.
