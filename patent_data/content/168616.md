# Apparatus and method for multicolour printing by means of a thermal ink ribbon.

## Abstract
A resistive ribbon thermal transfer printer has a ther mal print head 18 movable across a record medium 12 , and a ribbon 10 which passes between the print head and record medium from a supply reel 16 to a take up reel 30 . A selectively rotatable colour transfer device 42 applies one of four colours, depending on its angular position, to the fusible layer on the ribbon, between the supply reel and the print head.
