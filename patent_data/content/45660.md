# Golf swing simulator device.

## Abstract
A golf swing simulator comprises a handle 10 pivotally connected about an axis 28 to an arm 20 , which in turn is pivotally connected about an axis 26 to a mounting 14, 15, 16 . The mounting includes two parts 14, 16 which are adjustable to vary the angle of the axis 26 to the horizontal. The connection between the handle 10 and the arm 20 is via a crank 22 , pivot axis 28 and means 132, 133 for adjusting the angle of the axis 28 relative to the axis 26 . This latter angular adjustment is centred about the point of intersection X of the pivot axis 28 with the longitudinal axis 34 of the handle.
