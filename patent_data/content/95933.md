# PLASTIC CONVEYOR BELT

## Abstract
A conveyor belt made of plastic modules capable of being integrally driven by sprocket wheels. The modules are elon gated molded bodies having projections extending integrally from the opposite sides thereof. The projections of adjacent modules are interdigited and connected by rods. The modules are provided with cylindrical driving surfaces in transverse openings therethrough which openings are each aligned with a different projection on one side of the bodies. The combina tion of projections and driving openings provides a foraminous belt, upon interconnection of the modules, allowing free circu lation of gases and liquids through the belt for processing of products carried thereby and for cleaning and sterilization of the belt. The belt may be adapted to traverse a curved path.
