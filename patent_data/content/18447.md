# An aqueous paper coating composition, and coated paper.

## Abstract
Paper coating compositions having an improved com ination of properties are prepared by admixing, in the normal proportions and by conventional techniques, one or more conventional paper coating pigments with a par ticular type of synthetic polymer latex. In such com positions, the particular latex employed is alkalisensitive and is prepared by emulsion polymerizing A from 10 to 90 parts by weight of a monomer mixture comprising, based upon the weight of such monomer mixture, 1 from 10 to 60 weight percent of an ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid monomer and 2 from 40 to 90 weight percent of a copolymerizable monoolefin compound in the presence of B from 10 to 90 parts by weight, on a polymer solids basis, of a copolymer latex comprising a monovinylidene aromatic monomer such as styrene and an open chain aliphatic conjugated diene such as butadiene.
