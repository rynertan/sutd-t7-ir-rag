# HEAT RECOVERABLE ARTICLE

## Abstract
Self supporting helical heat recoverable material provides easily installed insulating covering for wires and cables. The helical arrangement may be made by differential recovery of a two layered tape of the heat recoverable material around a cooled mandrel such that the inner tape layer recovers more than the outer. The inner layer may also serve as an adhesive layer or may carry an adhesive coating.
