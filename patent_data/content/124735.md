# Operating circuit for electric discharge lamp.

## Abstract
There is disclosed an operating circuit for an electric dis charge lamp in which a first DC operating circuit 26 for starting an electric discharge lamp 32 , a second DC operat ing circuit 28 for making the electric discharge lamp opera tive by a voltage near a rated lamp voltage and by a current near a rated lamp current, and a third DC operating circuit 30 for supplying a relatively large current to the electric dis charge lamp immediately after the electric discharge lamp is started and for stabilizing the lamp luminous flux in a short time, are connected in parallel. A switching circuit 62 for cutting off the first DC operating circuit after the electric dis charge lamp is started is provided at the output terminal of the first DC operating circuit. In addition, reverse current prevent ing circuits 66, 68 for preventing the currents from reversely flowing from the operating circuits at higher voltages are provided at the output terminals of the second and third DC operating circuits.
