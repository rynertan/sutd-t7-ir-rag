# Process for the synthesis of glycol monomethylethers.

## Abstract
A process for the synthesis of glycol monomethylethers consisting of reacting an olefin compound, methanol and hy drogen peroxide in aqueous solution in the presence of syn thetic zeolites containing titanium atoms, of general formula xTiO₂ 1 x SiO₂, where x lies between 0.0001 and 0.04
