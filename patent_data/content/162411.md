# Process for the production of active anode materials for use in cells.

## Abstract
Active anode materials comprising amalgamated zinc powder for use in cells, in which the corrosion of zinc is effectively inhibited by a smallest possible amount of mer cury, may be produced by a process comprising atomizing molten zinc added with mercury to obtain pre amalgamated zinc powder and bringing the thus obtained powder, which is dispersed in a liquid, into contact with mercury or an amal gam to further amalgamate said pre amalgamated zinc pow der.
