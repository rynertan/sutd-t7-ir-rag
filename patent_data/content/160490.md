# A semiconductor laser.

## Abstract
A semiconductor laser for laser oscillation at long wavelength or short wavelength visible light comprises a substrate 4 for crystal growth having a striped channel 2 , an active layer 7 for laser oscillation, and a cladding layer 6 containing Mg which is in contact with the side of said active layer 7 which faces the striped channel 2 in the substrate 4 .
