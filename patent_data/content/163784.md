## Description
Si CONTAINED FERROALLOY ADDITION AS A WEAK PRE DEOXITION PROCESS IN STEELMAKINGThis invention concerns witit Weak Pre deoxidation practice in steelmaking. Adding Si contained ferroalloy during tapping stage as weak pre deoxidation practice, this rlew practice could achieve lower production cost and thigh quality steel products. For rimmed steel production very mino addition of deoxidizer results in higher free oxygen contain in molten rimmed steel, which would react with solute element in molten steel, a solid skin layer around the ingot surface is formed.Such solid skin layer possessing good surface quality and soft characteristics will improve cold heading formability of the steel products whereas the inner part of rimmed steel could not provided for higher grade application because of its poor cleaniness. Ifigh free oxygen in rimmed steel liquid, couldn t be casted by continuous casting process, casted ingot causes lower production yield. imed steel couldn t be provided for special application for the reasons stated as above.For fully killed steel, the deoxidizer Al, Si, Ti, Mn added during tapping process is oxidized by the free oxygen in molten steel. The rcaction is shown below xAt y O MxOy M Deoxidizer, such as Al, Si, Ti, Mn etc. C frees oxygen in molten steel x,y coefficientBecause of lower free oxygen after deoxidizine, the fully killed often steel could be casted continuous casting process,Generally speaking, the production yield and internal quality of the continuous casted products is superior than that of ingot.Lower recovery rate and higher addition amount of deoxidizer for fully killed steel causes higher production costs and results in the residual of deoxidizing formations remained in steel. Such residual deoxidation formations is harmful to processing formability while the Weak Pre deoxidation process could vanish the defects stated above and provides lower cost higher cleaniness and higher quality steel products.Producting steel for cold working or forming applications by continuous casting, fully killed steel is usually adopted to avoid casting incident and blow hole formation in steel, Al and or Ti is the major deoxidizer in continuous casting process.Killed steel for cold working or forming applications could be classified into Al killed and Ti killed steel according to the deoxidizer adopted. Al killed steel as an exanple, in order to reduce work hardening effect, any Si contained ferroalloy could not be permitted to add into molten steel during steolmaking process, only Al is used as deoxidizer.Owing to the deoxidation reaction of Al 2Al 3 oJ A12o3 , alumina cluster Al2o3 forms in molten steel and rent ins in solid steel as inclusion, which could not be elongated during deformation, thus interfere the cold heading or working forxability. The objective of this new process stated above is to overcome the shortness of deoxi dstion practice, that is to reduce work hardening effect.For conventional Al killed steel, any Si contained ferroalloy could not be added during steelmaking. Such deoxidation concept is modified by this new deoxidation process, during tapping of top blowing furnace, bottom blowing furnace, top and bottom combined blowing furnace or electric arc furnace appropriate amount ofSi contained ferroalloy could be added in the condition of no Si remained in molten steel. Free oxygen content of the molten steel in ladle could be reduced as Si contained ferroallpy added then the ladle is transferred to Al wire feeder system or ladle injection treating station to proceed the final stage deoxidatiO with Al and or Ti killing, or otller composition adjustment. This new process will increase the recovery rate of deoxidizer, decrease the amount of deoxidizer and ferroalloy copsWmption and save production cost. Because of less deoxidizer and alloy addition, deoxidized formations could be reduced that would remarkably improve the internal cleaniness of the steel products,The major premise of this invention is to add Si contained ferroalloy as weak pre deoxidation process with the furance such as top blowing type, botton blowing type, top and bottom combined type or electric arc furnace or during tapping, then following by final stage deoxidation process by Al and or Ti addition Alwire feeder system and or ladle injection treating station are the undeficient equipments for this new deoxidation process.After treating by Al and or Ti with this new process, good shrouding system should be adopted during continuous casting or ingot teemming process to protect the molteii steel from reoxi dizing by the atmosphere. Consequently, cleaner steel could be acquired by this new process. The explanation of this new process proceeding with various installation is described as following flow chart Fig.1 This invention will be oxplained in detail with some figures and tables as followingt .. Fig. 2 shows the relationship between the amount of Si contained ferroalloy added and the free oxygen content before adding aluminium as a deoxidizer into the liquid steel which has no residual Si . In general, in order to prevent the liquid steel from containing residual Si, no Si contained ferroalloy could be permitted to add into molten steel to adjust the chemical composition in producingAl killed steel, ferromanganese is usually added. But manganese itself is not a good deoxidizer. Therefore, if weak pre deoxi day ion with Si contained ferroalloy is not performed before Al addition in producing Al killed steel, the residual free oxygen content in the liquid steel will be very high and unstable. Fig. 2 indicates that with appropriate amount of Si contained ferroalloy addition the free oxygen content in the liquid steel before Al deoxidation can evidently be lowered. By using this process, the recovery of deoxidizer can be improved and the oxides retained in the liquid steel after deoxidation can be reduced as well, thus the quality of bloom, slab and ingot can be improved.Fig. 3 a 3 b compere the Si content in the liquid steel between WPD Process and non WPI Process. Fig. 3 a shows the distribution of Si contents in the final molten steel treated by weak pre deoxidiilng with Si contained ferroalloy. Fig. 3 b shows the distribution of Si contents in the final.molten steel without WPD treatment.Fig. 3 a 3 b indicates the percent of the number of heats which contain Si less than 0.0 4 in the liquid steel by using WPDProcess is 96.8 , while that of non 9PD Process is 95.8 . The data obviously shows that the proportion of Si content below 0.02 in the liquid steel of WID Process is even a little bit higher than that of non VPD Process.The Si content analyzed by spectroscope is total Sicontent including silica , thus confirms thatSi contained ferroalloy will not cause Si to be retained in the liquid steel. It can also be confirmed by microscope. WhileSi contained ferroalloy is added into liquid steel, Si wiri react with free oxygen first and forms silicon dioxide siO2 particles, which distribute in the whole liquid steel. Manganese will then reacts with the oxygen around 5iO2 and forms Silicon manganese oxides. which can float up almost completely after gas stirring.Therefore. it is the characteristics of the present invention that by adding appropriate amount of Si contained ferroalloy during tapping or into furnace the free osygen content can be reduced effectively before Al and or Ti addition, without fearing of Si being retained.Fig 4 shows the comparison of the rate of Al recovery betweenAl killed steel produced by Weak Pre Deoxidation Process and conventional deoxidation process. For Al wire feeder system, the rate of Al recovery was evidently increased by this invention as indicated in Fig. 4, that is due to the content of free oxygen in molten steel is remarkably decreased. Because of higher recovery rate of Al, caused less Al addition, deoxidation form ations could be effectively reduced. Consequently, the internal cleaniness and surface quality of the steel product was remarkably improved by this new process.Table I shows the comparison of free oxygen content between WPDProcess and conventional deoxidation process before aluminum and or titanium addition.Purpose of this invention is to lower down the free oxygen content of molten steel as possible before the addition of deoxidizers aluminum and or titanium . The key point of this process is to spoke sure that there is no silicon remained in the molten steel The data listed in the table obviously show that after WPD Process treatment the free oxygen content can be greatly decreased before the addition of deoxidizers.The amount of free oxygen content lowered can be controlled directly by adjusting the amount of Si contained ferroalloy addition. Owing to the decrease of free oxygen content, recovery of aluminum can be improved, cost can be lowered, and the quality of steel products can be improved remarkably.Table 2 shows the comparison of typical chemical compositions between the general cold working Al killed steel grade and the steel designed according to this invention for the same end use.The main difference is that typical chemical composition designed according to this invention has lower aluminum content than that of conventional Al killed steel grid. The reason for this composition design is to decrease the inclusion formation of deoxi day ion to get cleaner molten steel. Because of more deoxidizers are added, more chances to form inclusions would result and the cost is also higher. Therefore, the principle of chemical composition design by this invention is to lower the addition of deoxidizers such as aluminum and or titanium under the condition of no poor deoxidation and good formability. And with the aid or WPD Process, the amount of deoxidizers added can be decreased, cleaner steel and lower production cost will be resulted.This deoxidation method is also suitable for any other kind ofAl killed steel grade.Table 3 shows the comparison of estimated index of inclusions between different deoxidation processes. In respect of quality, the main prupose of WPD Process is to improve the internal cleaniness, and improve the quality of casted steel. The table obviously shows that under this new process, the estimated index of inclusions is much better tllan that of conventional process.It can also be sured that the UPI Process has much improvement on internal quality of casted steel.Table 4 shows the comparison of grindi ig speed of billets between different deoxidation processes. In respect of quality, the WPDProcess improves not only tie internal cleaniness of the casted steel, but also its surface quality. Data listed in the table represent pieces of billets to be ground within unit time per hour . The worse in surfacial quality, the bigger in area and depth should be grinding, so less pieces of billets could be treated within unit time in order to eet same level of surfacinl quality. This table shows that the grinding speed of billets treated by the WPD Process is faster than that of conventional deoxidation process. Therefore, the VPD Process can make much improvement on surfacial quality of casted steel, and save much surface conditioning cost.
