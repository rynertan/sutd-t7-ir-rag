Demonstration of Effectiveness The compounds of Examples 3 and 4 were dosed orally in mice at 100 mg kg . These compounds were adminstered in 10 dimethylformamide 90 olive oil.The dose was equivalent to approximately 62 mg kg of benzyl penicillin and 38 mg kg of the clavulanate. An antibacterial assay was used to determine revels of benzyl penicillin in blood samples. A P lactamase inhibition assay was employed to determine levels of the clavulanate in the samples.
