# Crawling pest eliminator system and method.

## Abstract
A crawling pest eliminator system mounted on a back pack mounting frame. A crawling pest flushing system is sup ported on the frame for spraying a flushing agent into cracks, crevices and wall voids and thereby initially flushing crawling pests, such as cockroaches, ants and spiders, out of their hid ing places. A vacuuming system is also supported on the frame. The vacuuming system includes a vacuum motor, a re movable recovery bag and a nozzle adapted to ride on the sur faces for efficiently vacuuming into the recovery bag the eggs of the crawling pests and the crawling pests themselves includ ing those flushed out by the crawling pest flushing system. A flashlight is integrally built into the adapter into which the nozzle is inserted for illuminating the surfaces. A residual de positing system is also supported by the frame for depositing a pesticide residual on these surface which have been vacuu med of crawling pests and their eggs by the vacuuming sy stem. A spray gun is selectively communicable with either of the aerosol canisters of the flushing or depositing systems for spraying either the flushing agents or residuals. After the bag has been filled it is removed and destroyed in a blender or crusher.
