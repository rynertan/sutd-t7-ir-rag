# Action figure with wing movement derived from leg movement.

## Abstract
The toy action figure includes a torso having a pair of pivotally mounted wings and a pair of legs, the legs being mounted to the torso for both pivotal and rocking move ment. A pair of actuating mechanisms within the torso convert the rocking movement to a pivotal movement so that the wings are moved in a flapping manner. A spring returns the legs and wings to their normal or unactuated positions whenever the child stops pressing the legs together.
