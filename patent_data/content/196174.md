# Means for sequential solid phase organic synthesis and methods using the same.

## Abstract
A means for carrying out sequential, solid phase syntheses is disclosed as are methods of its use. The synthesis means comprises a foraminous container that encloses reactive parti cles. The particles are larger than any of the foraminae and have a known amount of covalently linked organic synthesis reactive functionality that is capable of reacting during the or ganic syntheses. The container and particles are substantially insoluble in water.
