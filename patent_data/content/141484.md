## Description
METHODS OF PRODUCING HYBRID DNA SEQUENCES AND HYBRID POLYPEPTIDES AND DNA SEQUENCES PRODUCED BY THEM TECHNICAL FIELD OF INVENTION This invention relates to hybrid polypeptides, the DNA sequences coding for them and to methods of producing those DNA sequences and polypeptides. The methods of this invention are characterized by the steps of a preparing a DNA fragment or concatemer thereof, said fragment comprising in sequence one of the parental DNA sequences from which the hybrid DNA sequence is to be derived, an intact replicon such that the DNA fragment may be replicated in a host cell, and the other parentalDNA sequence from which the hybrid DNA sequence is to be derived, the two parental DNA sequences having a sequence of at least three, and preferably at least five, nucleotides in common in the location where hybrid DNA formation is sought and the direction of translation of the coding sequences in the two parental sequences being the same relative to each other in the DNA fragment and b selecting host cells that have been transfected with the desired hybrid DNA sequence and isolating said hybrid DNA sequence from them. Selection of the desired host cells may be facilitated by having each parental DNA sequence associated with a different antibiotic resistance marker and growing the transformed host cells on agar plates, containing both antibiotics. The hybrid DNA sequences produced by the methods of this invention enable the production of novel hybrid polypeptides having a variety of uses and biological activities. BACKGROUND ART Recent advances in recombinant DNA technology and molecular biology have enabled the isolation and identification of a variety of DNA sequences and genes that code for a large number of different polypeptides. For example, DNA sequences coding for the ten or more human a interferons are described in C. Weissmann et al., Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B299, pp. 7 28 1982 . DNA sequences coding for human B interferon and human y interferon are described in R. Derynck et al., Nature 285, pp. 542 547 1980 and R. Devos et al., Nucleic Acids Research 10, pp. 2487 2501 1982 , respectively. DNA sequences coding for non interferon polypeptides are also available. They include DNA sequences coding for human insulin D. Goeddel et al., Proc. Natl.Acad. Sci. USA 76, pp. 106 110 1979 1, rat insulin L. Villa Komaroff et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 75, pp. 3727 3731 1978 , human growth hormone D. Goeddel et al., Nature 281, pp. 544 548 1979 3 and bovine growth hormone tW. Miller et al., DNA 1, pp. 37 50 1981 W. Miller et al., Endocrinology 107, pp. 851 854 1980 . DNA sequences coding for a variety of viral antigens are also available. These include DNA sequences encoding the viral antigens of hepatitis B virus tM. Pasek et al.,Nature 282, pp. 575 579 1979 C. Burrell et al., Nature 279, pp. 43 47 1979 3 and the DNA sequences encoding the viral antigens of foot and mouth disease virus R. Kipper et al., Nature 289, pp. 555 559 1981 . Certain hybrid DNA sequences consisting of parts of two or more of the above described DNA sequences are also available. These hybrids are conventionally prepared by using restriction sites that occur in the various DNA sequences and ligating two restricted fragments together at a common restriction site or by blunt end ligation of different restriction fragments to produce the hybrid DNA sequence. These hybrid DNA sequences may then be employed to transform appropriate host cells and to produce the hybrid polypeptide coded for by them. For example, hybridDNA sequences of human al and a2 interferon, and the hybrid interferons coded for by them, have been prepared using this restriction and ligation method tM. Streuli et al.,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 78, pp. 2848 2852 1981 ,R.Lawn et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 9, pp. 1045 1052 1981 . Depending on the particular construction and components of these hybrid interferons, they may display similar or vastly different specificities, activities and properties than the parental polypeptides from which they are derived. For exampie, although the specific activity of human al interferon is comparatively low in human cells and comparatively high in mouse cells, hybrids of al and a2 carrying the N terminal half of a2 have high activity in human cells. Although these prior methods have permitted the formation of certain hybrid DNA sequences and their use in the synthesis of certain hybrid polypeptides, they are very limited in their application. For example, hybrid formation by these prior methods requires the existence of a restriction site in both DNA sequences at the point where hybrid formation is desired. More usually, these methods require digestion of the DNA sequences from a convenient restriction site to the point where hybrid formation is desired and determination of when the digestions have reached the correct nucleotide. This is a very laborious and time consuming undertaking.Moreover, in DNA sequences that are closely related like the a interferons, in order to avoid deleting or adding nucleotides in one or both of the DNA sequences, the restriction sites or digestions have to be in homologous portions of the DNA sequences. Such convenient restriction sites, digestions and homologies are plainly often not available.Furthermore, even in the few instances when such restriction sites are available, the number of possible hybrids able to be made from them is very small and their preparation very time consuming. Therefore, there is a need in the recombinantDNA art to develop new methods for forming hybrid DNA sequences that do not depend on the chance availability of appropriate restriction sites in the two DNA sequences which one seeks to combine or in sequential deletions from one or both of those sites in order to produce products of modified use, activity and specificity, as compared to the polypeptides coded for by their parental DNA sequences. DISCLOSURE OF TRE INVENTION This invention solves the above described problems and avoids the disadvantages that beset prior methods of hybrid DNA sequence formation. It provides for the first time novel hybrid polypeptides, the DNA sequences that code for them and methods of producing those DNA sequences and polypeptides. The novel hybrid DNA sequences of this invention are characterized by at least two connected sequences of nucleotides, the first sequence of nucleotides being connected to the second sequence of nucleotides in their original reading frames and so as to maintain constant that reading frame in each sequence through a DNA sequence of at least three, and preferably at least five, nucleotides that was common to or inserted into both parentalDNA sequences at the location where hybrid formation was sought. These novel DNA sequences encode the hybrid polypeptides of this invention and enable their production in appropriately transformed hosts. The methods of this invention enable the construction of those hybrid DNA sequences and polypeptides in a simple and efficient manner. In one embodiment of the method of this invention, where the two parental DNA sequences from which the hybrid DNA sequence is to be derived originally have a sequence of at least three, and preferably at least five, nucleotides, and more preferably at least 8, and most preferably at least 13 nucleotides, in common, in the location where hybrid DNA sequence formation is sought, the method comprises the steps of a preparing a DNA fragment or more usually a concatemer thereof, said fragment comprising in sequence one of the parental DNA sequences from which the hybrid DNA sequence is to be derived, an intact replicon such that the DNA fragment may be replicated in a host cell, and the other parental DNA sequence from which the hybrid DNA sequence is to be derived, the two parental DNA sequences having a sequence of at least 3, and preferably at least 5, nucleotides in common in the location where hybrid DNA formation is sought and the direction of translation of the coding sequences in the two parental sequences in said fragment being the same relative to each other and b selecting host cells that have been transfected with the desired hybrid DNA sequence and isolating said hybrid DNA sequence from them. In another embodiment of the method of this invention, where the two parental DNA sequences from which the hybrid DNA sequence is to be derived do not originally have a sequence of at least three, and preferably at least five, nucleotides in common at the location where hybridDNA sequence formation is sought, the method comprises the steps of a preparing a linear DNA fragment or a concatemer thereof, said fragment comprising in sequence one of the parental DNA segments from which the hybrid DNA sequence is to be derived, an intact replicon such that the fragment may be replicated in a host cell, the other of the parental DNA sequences from which the hybrid DNA sequence is to be derived, the direction of translation of the coding sequences in the two parental sequences being the same relative to each other in the DNA fragment b forming in one of said parental DNA sequences at the location where said hybrid formation is sought a sequence of at least three, and preferably at least five, nucleotides, said nucleotide sequence being identical to and in the same reading frame as a DNA sequence at the location where said hybrid formation is sought in said other parental DNA sequence and c selecting host cells that have been transfected with the desired hybrid DNA sequence and isolating said hybrid DNA sequences from them. It should of course be understood that in this embodiment of our invention the formation of the common nucleotide sequence in one or the other DNA sequence may be done prior to preparing the DNA fragment. Moreover, it should be also understood that the necessary homology in the two parental DNA sequences could also be provided by inserting into both DNA sequences the same or similar sequences so as to build the required sequence homology into both sequences before or after preparing.the DNA fragment. In the more preferred embodiment of this invention, each of the parental DNA sequences is also associated with a different antibiotic resistance marker. In this preferred embodiment, selection of the desired host cells may be facilitated by growing the transformed host cells on agar plates containing both antibiotics. This preferred method of selection is very useful in this invention from a practical standpoint because the yield of desired recombinants or hybrid DNA sequences is low and even a minute contamination with one or the other parental DNA sequences or with DNA sequences resulting from the ligation of two identical parental DNA sequences may result in a high level of unwanted transformants that would be difficult to screen in order to select the desired hybrid without such dual antibiotic resistance. In still another embodiment of this invention, the circularization and ligation step to form the hybrid DNA sequence is done in vitro, leaving only heteroduplex repair to take place in the host cell after its transfection with that hybrid DNA sequence. In this less preferred embodiment, the ends of the DNA fragment, or concatemer thereof, are rendered single stranded before in vitro circularization and ligation. The DNA sequences of this invention are characterized by at least two connected sequences of nucleotides, each connected DNA sequence being derived from a different parental DNA sequence, the first sequence of nucleotides being connected to the second sequence of nucleotides in the original reading frame and so as to maintain constant that reading frame in each sequence through a DNA sequence of at.least three, and preferably at least five, nucleotides that was common to or inserted into both parentalDNA sequences at the location where hybrid formation was sought. These DNA sequences enable the production of novel proteins and polypeptides having a variety of uses and biological activities.

BEST MODE OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION In order that the invention herein described may be more fully understood, the following detailed description is set forth. Referring now to Figure 1, we have depicted one preferred embodiment of a method according to this invention for preparing the novel hybrid DNA sequences of this invention. The two parental DNA sequences depicted inFigure 1, sequences 1 and 2, from which the hybrid DNA sequence is derived, have a sequence 3 of at least three, and preferablyat least five, and more preferably at least 8, and most preferably at least 13 nucleotides, in common in the location where hybrid DNA sequence formation is sought. As depicted in Figure 1, parental sequences 1 and 2 are part of plasmids or other cloning vehicles.However, it is to be understood that the parental DNA sequences useful in the methods of this invention may be derived from any source of DNA sequences provided that upon combination they form a DNA fragment fragment 5 in Figure 1 , or a concatamer thereof, said fragment comprising in sequence one of the parental DNA sequences, an intact replicon 4 in Figure 1 such that the fragment may be replicated in a host cell, and the other parentalDNA sequence, the two parental DNA sequences having a sequence of at least three, and preferably at least five, nucleotides in common in the location where hybrid DNA formation is sought and the direction of translation of coding sequences in the two parental sequences being the same relative to each other in the DNA fragment.Such sources of DNA sequences include, for example, natural sources, synthetic sources, semisynthetic sources, cDNA libraries and combinations of them. In the embodiment depicted in Figure 1, DNA fragment 5 comprises parental DNA sequences 1 and 2 and intact replicon 4. It also comprises antibiotic resistance markers A associated with the first parental DNA sequence and antibiotic resistance markers B associated with the second parental DNA sequences. DNA fragment 5 in that embodiment was prepared by first linearizing the plasmids carrying parental DNA sequences 1 and 2 using a restriction site located outside of the respective parental DNA sequences. The restriction site used for such linearization need not be the same in both plasmids, although preferably the same site is employed for ease of combination of the two resulting fragments through the compatible restriction residues.However, it is to be understood that various means of combining the two fragments that do not require the same restriction residues may also be employed in the methods of this invention. These means, for example, include tailing, bluntending, fill in and synthetic linkers, as well as use of two different restriction sites which yield the same overhanging ends, for example, BqlII and BamHI. In the embodiment depicted in Figure 1, the linearized plasmids were next restricted RestrictionSites B to remove that portion of the linearized plasmid located before the start of parental DNA sequence 1 and that portion of the linearized plasmid located after the end of parental DNA sequence 2. The resulting DNA fragments were then combined to form Fragment 5, or a concatemer thereof, said fragment having only one replicon and the direction of translation of the two coding sequences from the parental DNA sequences being the same relative to each other in the DNA fragment. Fragment 5 also carries antibiotic resistance markers A and B, respectively associated with the two different parentalDNA sequences to facilitate selection of the desired fragment construction. Again, it is to be understood that the particular sequence of steps employed in the embodiment of this invention depicted in Figure 1 is not required to constructDNA sequence 5 employed in this invention to prepare the novel hybrid DNA sequences of this invention. For example, although it is preferred that the DNA sequence 5 start at one end with the first parental DNA sequence and end at the other end with the other parental sequence, DNA sequences that begin and or end outside of the parentalDNA sequences may also be used in the methods of this invention, provided the additional nucleotide sequences do not occur elsewhere in the sequence chosen. DNA sequences that begin and or end within the parental DNA sequences are also useful in this invention.All that is required for the method of this invention is that the DNA sequence 5 cÏmprise in sequence one parental DNA sequence 1 , an intact replicon 4 and the other parental DNA sequence 2 , the two parental DNA sequences having a sequence of at least three, and preferably at least five, nucleotides in common in the location where hybrid DNA formation is sought and the direction of translation of the coding sequences in the two parental DNA sequences being the same relative to each other in the fragment. In the embodiment depicted in Figure 1, circularization of DNA sequence 5 and overlap of the homologous sequences of nucleotides in the location where hybrid formation is sought in both parental DNA sequences is effected in vivo by the host cell which is transfected by the DNA sequence. The host cell used for this transfection should be recombination proficient, and preferably be recA . In the embodiment depicted in Figure 1, the host cell effects combination of the parental DNA sequences within that region of DNA sequence homology and heteroduplex repair to form a vector or plasmid that contains the desired hybrid DNA. It should1 however, also be understood that recircularization and recombination of the DNA sequences may also be done in vitro using conventional means and the host employed only to effect heteroduplex repair. See, for example, Figure 2. However, because it involves more biochemical steps, in vitro combination is less preferred in the practice of this invention. In the preferred embodiment of this invention, depicted in Figure 1, the parental DNA sequences had the required homology pre existing at the locationwhere hybrid DNA sequence formation was desired. Such parentalDNA sequences include, for example, the fifteen or more human leukocyte interferons, the various animal leukocyte interferons, including mouse, bovine, porcine, equine and chicken, human fibroblast interferon, which is characterized by stretches of homology of up to 13 nucleotides as compared to the leukocyte interferons, animal fibroblast interferons, human immune interferon and animal immune interferons. They may also include various related lymphokines and the antigens to the various strains and serotypes of foot and mouth disease virus. In a less preferred embodiment of this invention, the parental DNA sequences do not have the required homology. Accordingly, in that embodiment, which is depicted in Figure 3, the required homology is added to one or both of the parental DNA sequences in vitro by adding a sequence of nucleotides that corresponds to the sequence of nucleotides in the other parental DNA sequence or some predetermined sequence at the location where hybrid DNA sequence formation is sought. After providing the required homology to the two parental DNA sequences, the steps in the method of this invention, previously described, may be usefully employed in this embodiment to produce the novel hybrid DNA sequences of this invention.Therefore, the method of this invention is applicable to any parental DNA sequence. Having prepared the novel hybrid DNA sequences of this invention by the methods described above1 those sequences may then be employed to produce the novel polypeptides coded for by them. Various known methods and hosts may be employed to express these hybrid DNA sequences to produce those novel polypeptides. For Example, the hybrid ONA sequence may be isolated from the plasmid produced in the above described method, inserted into various known expression vectors under the control of various known expression control sequences and employed to transform various hosts, which upon culturing will produce the desired polypeptides. Expression control sequences are sequences of nucleotides that control and regulate the expression ofDNA sequences when operatively linked to those sequences in expression vectors. Those useful in expressing the novel hybrid DNA sequences of this invention include, but are not limited to, the lac system, trp system, the major operator and promoter regions of phage A, the control regions of fd coat protein, the S lac system, the TAC system, the TRC System, and other sequences known to control the expression of genes of prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells or their viruses or combinations thereof. Hosts useful in accordance with this invention for preparing the hybrid DNA sequences of this invention in vivo and for expressing those hybrid DNA sequences include various strains of E.coli, e.g., E.coli Blol, E.coli 1776, E.coli 2282, E.coli MRCI, E.coli SK1592 and E.coli 803, Pseudomonas, Bacillus, including Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus stearothermophilus, yeasts and other fungi, animal, including Chinese Hamster ovary cells, or plant hosts and human cells in culture. For transfection to produce the hybrid DNA sequence, the strains should be recombination proficient and more preferably be rec A .Of course not all host expression vector combinations may be equally efficient for the formation of or expression of a particular hybrid DNA sequence. However, the particular selection of a host vector combination may be made by those of skill in the art without departing from the scope of this invention. Similarly, methods of inserting the hybrid DNA sequence into the above described expression vectors, transforming the above described host or culturing those hosts may be chosen from among various well known methods without departing from the scope of this invention. The novel polypeptides produced using the hybridDNA sequences of this invention have a variety of uses.For example, the hybrid a interferons produced by this invention have various activities in certain cells and various specific activities. Accordingly, such hybrids are useful in modifying the anti viral and anti cancer activities of the parental interferons for use in specific cells or against specific diseases. In like manner, hybrid proteins from the antigens of foot and mouth disease are useful in di or multivalent vaccines against various strains and serotypes of foot and mouth disease virus. In order to describe this invention so that it may be more clearly understood, the following examples are set forth. These examples are for the purpose of illustration and any specific enumeration therein should not be construed as a limitation of this invention. The enzymes that we used in these examples were purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. We purchased the labeled nucleotides from Amersham. And, we acquired the E.coli strains as follows SK1592 from Dr. S. Kushner,University of Georgia 803 from Dr. K. Murray, University of Edinburgh and CaC12 treated SKiS 92 was a gift fromM. Streuli. We prepared the plasmids containing the parental al and cr2 interferon genes by modifications of published methods 1T. Currier et al., Anal. Bioch. 76, pp. 431 441 1976 D. Holmes et al., Anal. Bioch. 114, pp. 193 197 19S1 . EXAMPLE 1 Example 1 demonstrates the formation of hybridDNA sequences coding for human a1 a2 hybrid interferons in vivo using the recombination machinery of E.coli and the production of such hybrid proteins in E. coli. TheDNA sequences for a1 and a2 human interferon are described, for example, in M. Streuli et al., At Least Three HumanType a Interferons Structure of a2 , Science, 209, pp. 1343 47 1980 . See also European patent application 32134 and clones deposited and made available in connection therewith. We constructed plasmid pM21 constructed for high expression of interferon a2 in E.coli by fusing theDNA sequence coding for mature a2 interferon to the initiation codon of the ss lactamase gene of plasmid pBR322. In that construction the interferon coding sequence and its 3L non coding sequence replaced the B lactamase coding sequence down to the PstI site, where it was linked to the p lactamase sequence by a poly dGC sequence. The remainder of the plasmid was identical to pBR322, including its intact tetracycline resistance coding region Figure 4 . See also European patent application 32134 ATCC 31769. We constructed the other parental plasmid, pMllkan, by inserting the al interferon coding sequence into a derivative of pBR322, in substantially the same way that we inserted the coding sequence for a2 interferon into pBR322 to obtain the pM21 plasmid Figure 4 . More specifically, we first prepared a derivative of pBR322 that included the genes coding for resistance to tetracycline, ampicillin and kanamycin pBR322kan , as described below. First, we partially digested pBR322 withHaeII in the presence of 50 pg ml ethidium bromide to yield mostly full size linear molecules. We then ligated these fragments to an equivalent amount of a 1430 bp fragment prepared by complete HaeII digestion of a derivative of pCRI a gift of M. Billeter . This fragment contained the gene coding for kanamycin resistance.We then selected transformants for resistance to kanamycin and ampicillin, and subsequently for resistance to tetracycline. For some reason, the simultaneous selection for resistance to all three antibiotics did not result in any surviving transformants. Restriction mappinq of our selected transformants demonstrated that in our construction the kanamycin resistance gene, contained in the 1430 bp HaeII fragment of pCRI, had been inserted into the BaeII site of pBR322 at position 2352 Figure 4 . We then prepared pMllkan by combining the following DNA sequences 1 the 4400 bp PstI SalI fragment of the above described kanamycin resistant pBR322 derivative pBR322kan , 2 the 1000 bp ClaI PstI fragment of pMll, containing the interferon al coding sequence, and 3 the about 800 bp ClaI SalI fragment of a pBR322 derivative pBR322BamR , containing a lambda DNA fragment linked by poly dG dC tracts inserted in the BamHI site where it inactivated the gene coding for tetracycline resistance present in that fragment. We had isolated the three fragments, described above, by electrophoresis on low melting agarose gels Sea Plaque agarose, FMC Corporation and used the gel slices after melting them at 650C directly for ligation. We selected transfectant colonies for kanamycin resistance and then on the basis of their tetracycline and ampicillin sensitivity. We confirmed the structure of the desired pMllkan by restriction mapping Figure 4 . To prepare the hybrid DNA sequences of this invention, we linearized pMllkan and pM21, and combined fragments thereof to prepare a DNA fragment, or more usually a concatemer thereof, said fragment containing both parental DNA sequences and an intact replicon. The fragment also contains one antibiotic resistance marker Kanamycin and a portion of another antibiotic resistance marker tetracycline associated with the al coding sequence and the portion of the tetracycline resistance marker that completes it associated with the a2 coding region. As a result, selection of the desired hybrid DNA is facilitated because only correctly constructed fragments will display both antibiotic resistances. To prepare this DNA fragment, we restricted pM21 with SalI and PstI and isolated the 1580 bp SalI PstI fragment of pM21 Figure 4 . We also restricted pNllKan with SalI and 8glII and isolated the 4970 bp SalI BglII fragment of pMllkan. We isolated these fragments from the digests by electrophoresis on low melting agarose 1.2 and 0.8 , respectively in 40 mM Tris acetate, 1 mM EDTA pH 7.8 .We then ligated the two fragments together at 160C for 18 h in a 20 p1 reaction mixture, containing 20 mM Tris HCl pH 7.8 , 10 mM MgC12, 10 mM DTT, 0.5 mM ATP, 10 20 fmol DNA fragments from melted slices of the agarose 2 5 p1 aliquots of agarose slices method at 650C, final agarose concentration 0.35 and DNA ligase 400 units, obtained from New England Biolabs . The resulting DNA fragment Figure 4 comprised in sequence the DNA sequence encoding mature a2 interferon, the DNA sequences encoding tetracycline resistance and kanamycin resistance, an intact replicon from pBR322 and the DNA sequence encoding the COOH terminal part of al interferon. Moreover, the parental al and a2 DNA sequences were in the correct translational orientation relative to each other in the DNA fragment to allow parallel overlap of homologous sequences of at least 3 nucleotides at the location where hybrid formation was sought. Accordingly, circularization of this DNA sequence by the methods of this invention produced hybrid DNA sequences encoding the amino terminal of a2 and the carboxy terminal of al, with the location of hybrid formation being downstream of the BqlII site in the al coding region. In order to circularize the DNA fragment and to form the desired hybrid DNA sequences, we transfected theDNA fragment into calcium chloride treated E.coli SK1592 prepared according to Cohen et al., Proc. Natl. Acad.Sci. USA, 68, pp. 2110 2114 1972 , and stored at 800C in a solution of 50 mM Caul2 in 20 glycerol . We employed 100 p1 transfection mixtures, containing 2.5 pl aliquots of the ligated DNA, 10 mM Cad21 10 mM MgCl21 10 mM TrisHC1 pull 7.5 and 65 pl of a suspension of the CaC12 treatedE.coli cells. We then maintained the resulting suspensions at OOC for 15 min and then at 420C for 2 min, diluted them with 1 ml of L broth and incubated them for 90 min at 370C with shaking. We then spread aliquots of the mixture of transformed cells on agar plates, containing L broth, kanamycin 50 pg ml and tetracycline 20 pg ml . This selection process ensured that only cells transformed with DNA sequences containing elements of both parental DNA fragments linked correctly at the SalI site gave rise to viable colonies because in our selection the proximal portion of the tetracycline resistance regionhas to be provided by the a2 containing fragment whereas the distal portion of the tetracycline resistance region as well as the kanamycin resistance gene must originate from the al containing fragment Figure 4 . In two separate experiments, we obtained 3 and 47 positive colonies, respectively, from transfection of portions containing 1 2 fmol fragments of the above ligation mixtures. The small number of colonies that we obtained in the first experiment may be due to the fact that the agarose containing liqation mixture we used in that experiment had been melted at 650C once before and stored subsequently at 250C for several days prior to its use. In subsequent experiments the number of colonies varied between 1600 and 90000 per pmol DNA fragments. We isolated plasmids from the cultures selected above by well known methods and analyzed the plasmids by restriction and DNA sequence analysis L. Guo et al., Null, Acids Res., 10, pp 2065 2084 1982 . We have summarized the results of our analyses in Table I. With the exception of clone 12.1, which contained a deletion, the clones analyzed represented correctlyrecombined hybrid DNA sequences without any gaps or insertions. Our conclusion is supported by 1 the distances between the BqlII sites and the flanking restriction sites on the 5 and 3 sides of the interferon insert Figure 4 , 2 sequence determinations of relevant portions of 21 plasmids, and 3 the fact that the bacterial cultures containing these recombinants, except for untested clone 12.1, produced interferon activities similar to the parental IFN a2, when tested on human cc123 cells. Among the 21 sequenced clones, we identified seven different crossover regions with the crossover region corresponding to the longest stretch of uninterrupted homology between the al 396 452 bp and a2 393449 bp sequence, being represented no less than 12 times. Moreover, these seven sequences code for five different a2 al hybrid interferons, only one of which was identical to the a2 al hybrid interferon previously obtained byStreuli et al., supra, using conventional genetic engineering techniques. Plasmid DNA extracted from the cultures of six of the selected colonies 3, 3 4, 102, 105, 107 and 110 showed heterogeneity with regard to the second BqlII site and plasmid DNA from one of these colonies 107 also showed heterogeneity with regard to the EcoRI site. These heterogeneities may be a result of the segregation of incompletely repaired heteroduplex strands or, alternatively, the result of transfection by several copies of recombination competent DNA, presumably covalently linked to concatenates.

See Figure 6. These 11 regions are designated A through K in Figure 6. One of these crossover regions K had a homology of only three nucleotides, demonstrating that three nucleotides was sufficient homology between the two parental DNA sequences for recombination using the methods of this invention. The 11 different recombinants encoded 9 different hybrid interferons. These arose from recombinants with crossovers in regions A, D, E, F, G, H and I J.Crossovers in regions B, C, I and J produced DNA sequences differing only by silent nucleotide changes. We employed these recombinant a2 al DNA sequences to transform host cells and to produce the hybrid interferons encoded by them. We then analyzed the antiviral activities of crude extracts of these hybrid interferons on human WISH cells, murine L929 cells and bovine MDBK cells. The antiviral activities of these hybrid interferons, as well as those of the parental IFN al and IFN a2, are displayed in Figure 7. The utility of the methods of this invention to produce interferons having different properties than their parents is exemplified by the dramatic drop observed in antiviralractivity on mouse cells as the COOH terminal al segment in the hybrid interferon is shortened beyond 25 . It should of course be understood tht other IFN a hybrids may be equally well produced by the methods of this invention. For example, the method chosen for preparation of the linear DNA sequence employed above to form the hybrid DNA sequences only allowed production of hybrids with the amino terminal of a2 and the carboxy terminal of al, with the crossover region downstream of the BqlII site of al. However, other restriction and digestion patterns allow us to obtain crossover in the parentalDNA sequences at any position or between two other preselected positions. Some of these alternative methods are illustrated in Examples II through V, below. Example II In this example we provide one alternative method for preparing an a2 al hybrid DNA sequence with crossover at any position. In this method, we restrict plasmid pM21 withSalI and PstI and isolate the fragment that contains theIFN a2 coding reqion. An XbaI linker is then introduced upstream of the IFN al gene in pMllkan to generate pMllkan Xba. For this construction a 1.4 Rb SalI EcoRI 1.4 Kb fragment from plasmid pGI was employed because it contained an Xba restriction site upstream of the al coding sequence. See, e.g., U. Weidle and C. Weissmann, The 5 Flanking Region Of A Human IFN a Gene MediatesViral Induction Of Transcription, Nature, 303, pp. 442 46 1983 . This construction is depicted in Figure 5.We then restrict pMllkan Xba with SalI and XbaI and isolate the SalI XbaI fragment that contains the IFN al coding region. Other restriction sites may be equally well employed to generate the al or a2 containing fragments in this Example without departing from the scope of this invention. E.g., the SalI PstI fragment of pMllkan maybe employed to generate an al containing fragment. Ligation of these two fragments produces a DNA sequence, or more usually a concatemer thereof, comprising in sequence the a2 coding region, an intact replicon from pBR322, and the al coding region. The DNA sequence also contains the resistance marker for kanamycin and the reconstructed marker for tetracycline resistance. After transfection of calcium treated E.coli substantially as described in Example I, that DNA sequence permits the production of a variety of a2 al hybrids having the possibility of crossover at any region where the sequences of homology between the coding sequences of al and a2 are at least a series of 5 nucleotides, and more preferably at least 8 13 nucleotides. EXAMPLE III In this example, we provide another embodiment of a method for preparing an a2 al hybrid DNA sequence with the crossover in the first third of the coding regions. In this method, we restrict plasmid pre121 withSalI and BglII and isolate the SalI BglII fragment, containing the coding region for the amino terminal end ofIFN a2. We also restrict pMllkan Xba with XbaI and PstI and isolate the XbaI PstI fragment, containing the coding region for IFN al. Ligation of these fragments produces aDNA sequence, or concatemer thereof, comprising in sequence about the first third of the a2 coding region, an intact replicon from pBR322, and the olL coding region. Again, other restriction sites may equally well be employed to generate these fragments.E.g., the SalI PstI fragment of pMllkan maybe employed to generate an al containing fragment After transfection of calcium treated E.coli, substantially as described in Example I, that DNA sequence permits the production of a variety of a2 al hybrids having the possibility of crossover in the first third of the a2 coding region, where the required homology with the cr1 coding region exists. EXAMPLE IV In this example, we provide a method for preparing an a2 crl hybrid DNA sequence with the crossover in the middle third of the coding regions. In this method, we restrict plasmid pM21 with SalI and PvuII and isolate theSalI PvuII fragment, containing the coding region of about the first two thirds of IFN a2. We also restrict pMllKan with SalI and BqlII and isolate the SalI BqlII fragment containing the about last two thirds of the IFN al coding region. Again, other restriction fragments may also be used. E.g., an XbaI SalI fragment of pMllKan Xba maybe used to generate an al containing fragment. Ligation of these fragments produces a DNA molecule, or concatemer thereof, comprising in sequence about the first two thirds of the a2 coding reqion, an intact replicon from pBR322, and about the last two thirds of the al coding region. After transfection of calcium treated E.coli, substantially as described in Example I, that DNA sequence permits the production of a variety of a2 crl hybrids having the possibility of crossover in the about middle one third of the a2 coding region, where the required homology with the cr2 coding region exists. EXAMPLE V In this example, we provide a method for preparing an al a2 hybrid DNA sequence with the crossover in the carboxy terminal end of the al coding region. In this method, we restrict plasmid pM21 with SalI and BqlII and isolate the SalI BqlII fragment containing the coding region for the COOH terminus of a2. We also restrict pMllKan with SalI and PstI and isolate the shorter SalIPstI fragment, containing the entire coding region for al.Ligation of these fragments produces a DNA sequence, or concatemer thereof, comprising in sequence the COOR terminal end of the a2 coding region, an intact replicon from pBR322, and the entire al coding region. After transfection of calcium treated E.coli, substantially as described above, that DNA sequence permits the production of a variety of al a2 hybrids having the possibility of crossover in the carboxy terminal end of the al coding region, where the required homology exists with the a2 coding region. The antibiotic selection method does not apply to this example. EXAMPLE VI In Examples I V the circularization step of the linear DNA sequence was done in vivo. This is the most preferred method of this invention. However, circularization may also be effected in vitro and only heteroduplex repair left to take place in vivo. This example illustrates this less preferred method of this invention. We digested pMllKan with BqlII to linearize it at position 189. We also partially digested pM21 withBglII about 60 70 of the full length linearized molecules ended at the downstream BglII site position 446 .We then digested each of the linearized plasmid preparations with T4 DNA polymerase to convert the terminal 300 400 nucleotides of each linear DNA sequence into single stranded form. After mixing the two sequences in about equal proportions, we allowed the mixture to anneal and filled in any remaining gaps with DNA polymerase. We then cleaved the resulting products with SalI and circularized them in the presence of ligase using standard conditions. We then transfected calcium treated E.coli Bob101 rec A , E.coli 803 rec or E.coli SK1592 rec A sbcB with the resulting DNA. We obtained colonies resistant to both tetracycline and kanamycin from each strain, but among the 21 clones that we analyzed further, only 1 an HB101 transfectant did not have a deletion or an otherwise rearranged sequence. This clone had 2 PvuII sites, 1EcoRI site and its region of recombination was in Region C Figure 6 . Therefore, while the in vivo process is more efficient and hence preferred, the in vitro process also permits the production of the hybrid DNAs of this invention. EXAMPLE VII In this example, we prepared recombinants of IFN a2 and IFN ss. A schematic outline of this method is depicted in Figure 8. The DNA sequence coding for IFN ss is described, for example, in R. Derynck et al., Isolation And Structure Of A Human Fibroblast Interferon Gene , Nature, 285, pp. 542 46 1980 . See also European patent application 41313 and the clones deposited and made available in connection therewith. We prepared plasmid pGB Figure 8 by combining three DNA fragments 1 the 0.77 Kb HincIf fragment of plasmid pBR325 FIF a gift of W. Fiers , this fragment contains the coding region for IFN 2 the 4.6 Rb partial RsaI SalI fragment of pBR322kan described above and 3 the 1.2 Kb partial HincII SalI fragment of pBR322BamR described above in the presence of ligase. We then used that plasmid to prepare transformants and selected positive clones by resistance to ampicillin, kanamycin and tetracycline, as described above. From these positive clones, we selected one clone characterized by a plasmid having the inserts in the orientation depicted in Figure 8. We designated this plasmid pGB. We next restricted pGB with SalI and HincII and isolated the 5.3 Kb SalI HincII fragment that contains the IFN ss coding region. We also restricted pM21 with PstI and SalI and isolated the 1.7 Rb PstI SalI fragment that contains the IFN aZ coding region. We then combined these fragments in the presence of ligase. The resulting DNA fragment Figure 8 comprised in sequence the DNA sequence encoding IFN ss, the DNA sequences encoding kanamycin resistance and tetracycline resistance and the DNA sequence encoding IFN a2. Moreover, the two IFN coding sequences were in the same translational orientation relative to each other so as to permit parallel overlap of homologous sequences to form hybrids according to the methods of this invention. In order to circulize the above described DNA fragment and to form the desired hybrid DNA sequences, we transfected it into E.Coli SK 1592 and selected positive clones as before. We obtained hybrids from four crossover regions F3, F8, F10 and F15. See Figure 9. Each had the 5 part of IFN a2 and the 3 part of IFN g. Recombinants in crossover regions F3, F10 and F15 were in phase , i.e. they occur at homologous positions. Recombinants in crossover region F8 are illegitimate recombinants because of the repeat TGAGA homology at two positions in the IFN ss coding region. See Figure 9. We used these a2 ss recombinants to transform host cells and to produce the a2 p hybrid interferons encoded by them. We then assayed the antiviral activity of the a2 p hybrid interferons on both human and bovine cells using crude extracts and conventional methods. The results are depicted in Table II. TABLE II w w Cells Hybrid Interferons F3 F8 F10 F15 Human WISH Cells 150Bovine NDBK Cells 50 2500Therefore, hybrid a2 ss interferons from crossover regionsF10 and F15 have antiviral activity. Moreover, the ratio of such activity on human and bovine cells is about 1 15.As a comparison, IFN a2 has a ratio of antiviral activity on human and bovine cells of about 1 1. Again, it should be understood that the above example is merely illustrative. Other regions of crossover between IFW a2 and IFN B may be utilized and other hybrid a ss or p a interferons may be prepared in accordance with the teachings of this invention. EXAMPLE VIII In this example, we prepare recombinants of human IFN a2 and mouse IFN a2. A schematic outline of this method is depicted in Figure 10. As depicted in Figure 10, we prepare plasmid pMllKan mouse by ligation of three DNA fragments 1 the 0.7 Rb AhaIII PstI fragment of pMIFa2 tG.D. Shaw et al.,Nucleic Acids Res., 11, pp. 555 73 1983 2 the 0.75 kb HindIII PstI fragment of pMIFa2 3 the 4.6 Kb AhaIII HindIII partial fragment of pMllKan. We then restrict pMllKan mouse with PstI and SalI to prepare a 4.7 Kb PstI SalI fragment containing the mouse IFN a2 coding region. We next combine this fragment with the 1.6 Kb AhaIII SalI fragment from pM21 that contains the amino terminal portion of the human IFN a2 coding region.Upon transformation into host cells as before, we are able to generate various recombinant human a2 mouse a2 DNA sequences that are useful in producing human mouse hybrid interferons. Again, it should be understood that other restriction sites and IFN a genes may be used to generate such human mouse hybrid DNA sequences and interferons in accordance with the methods of this invention.
