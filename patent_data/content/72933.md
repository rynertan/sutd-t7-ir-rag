# Method for photolithographic pattern generation in a photoresist layer.

## Abstract
With the method, in which the photoresist is exposed to radiation more than once, a hole pattern corresponding to the pattern of openings 15, 16 of an exposure mask 14 as well as a hole pattern corresponding to the negative of the pattern of openings 28, 29, 30 of another exposure mask 25 are sequentially produced ink a single photoresist layer 12 . The method is used e.g. in forming holes 23, 24 defined by the positive image into an oxide layer 11 on a substrate 10 , and in producing a metallization pattern 36a, 36b defined by the negative image for interconnecting areas of the substrate 10 .
