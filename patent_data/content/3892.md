We have found that a new class of 6 unsubstituted penems, more particularly described below, possess useful antibiotic activity, and according to one aspect of the invention, we provide compounds of formula I EMI1.1 wherein R represents a carboxyl or esterified carboxyl group and R represents the residue of a sulphur nucleophile, together with salts thereof. The compounds of formula I may exist as individual 5 position isomers or as mixtures thereof and the invention extends to the isomers of the compounds individually or in admixture. The carboxylic acid esters according to the invention may in general be represented as compounds of formula I in which R is a group COOR2 where R2 represents an organic group which is conveniently derived from an alcohol aliphatic or araliphatic , a phenol, a silanol or a stannanol. Such an alcohol, or stannanol used to esterify Lne crcl group prefer ably contains not more t 24 carbon atoms Thus, the group R2 may represent a straight or branched unsubstituted or subs fttuted alkyl or alkenyl group preferably having from 1 8 carbon atoms, for example a methyl, ethyl, propyl, lopropyl, butyl secbutyl, tert butyl or allyl group, optional substituents being for example, alkoxy e.g. methoxy halogen i.e.fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine cyano acyloxy, e.g. alkanoyloxy such as acetoxy or pivaloyloxy or alkoxycarbonyloxy e.g. ethoxycarbonyloxy acyl e.g. bromobenzoyl and alkoxycarbonyl e.g. ethoxycarbonyl an aralkyl group having up to 20 carbon atoms especially an arylmethyl group e.g. a benzyl or substituted benzyl group, suitable substituents being halo e.g.chloro nitro e.g. o nitro or nitro cyano alkoxy e.g. methoxy or alkyl e.g. dimethyl groups a diphenylmethyl or triphenylmethyl group or a fur 2 ylmethyl, thien 2 ylmethyl or pyrid 4 ylmethyl group, the heterocyclic groups of which may also be substituted e.g. by a C 1 4 alkyl group, preferably methyl an aryl group having up to 12 carbon atoms, e.g. a phenyl or substituted phenyl group, suitable substituents being halo e.g. chloro nitro e.g. o or nitro cyano alkoxy e.g. methoxy or alkyl e.g. dimethyl groups a mono or poly cyclic cycloalkyl group containing not more than 12 carbon atoms, e.g. cyclohexyl, cyclopentyl or adamantyl a heterocyclic group containing not more than 12 carbon atoms, the heteroatom being, for example, oxygen as in the tetrahydropyranyl or phthalidyl group a silyl group having up to 24 carbon atoms which may carry three groups which may be the same or different selected from alkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, aralkyl and aryl groups. Such groups will preferably be C 1 4 alkyl e.g. methyl, ethyl, n propyl, iso propyl or t butyl groups or a stannyl group having up to 24 carbon atoms for example a stannyl group carrying three substituents, which may be the same or different, selected from alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, aralkyl, cycloalkyl, alkoxy, aryloxy or aralkoxy groups. Such groups will include methyl, ethyl, propyl, n butyl, phenyl and benzyl groups. The group, R1 represents the residue of a sulphur nucleophile, for example an acylthio or thioacylthio group, a thioether group or a sulphone or sulphoxide derivative of said thioether group or a thiol group. In general these residues may be represented by the formulae 3 3 SH, SR , SO.R or S02R where R is an aliphatic, araliphatic, aromatic or heterocyclic group or by SC Y.R4 where Y is O or S and R is a group as defined 3 3 3 group 3 above for R or a group OR or Sir , where R is as defined above, or a group NR5R6, where R5 and R6, which may be the same or different, are hydrogen atoms or aliphatic, araliphatic, aromatic or carbon attached heterocyclic groups or together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached represent a heterocyclic ring . 3 4 5 6 Thus for example, R , R , R and R may be alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl groups, which may contain 1 6 carbon atoms aralkyl groups which may have 1 6 carbon atoms in the alkyl portion or aryl groups, such aryl and aralkyl groups preferably being monocyclic cycloalkyl groups1 which may have 3 7, preferably 5 or 6 carbon atoms or carbon attached 5 7 membered heterocyclic rings containing one to four heteroatoms such as nitrogen, sulphur or oxygen, and may carry one or more alkyl groups which may have 1 6 carbon atoms. Such groups may themselves carry substituents such as hydroxyl or substituted hydroxyl, carboxyl or substituted carboxyl, amino or substituted amino, azido or cyano groups. Representative groups R include methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, allyl, propargyl, 2 aminoethyl, 2 azidoethyl, cyano methyl, hydroxyethyl, ethoxyethyl, phenyl, benzyl, cyclohexyl, pyridyl, l methylpyridinium, 1methyl tetrazol 5 yl or 2 methyl 1,3,4 thiadiazol 5 yl. Representative groups R4.C Y. include ethoxythiocarbonyl, carbamoyl, thiocarbamoyl, dimethylthiocarbamoyl, thiobenzoyl, benzoyl, thioacetyl and acetyl. Where NR5R6 represents a heterocyclic ring, this may for example, contain 5 7 ring atoms, and may include one to three other heteroatoms e.g. nitrogen, oxygen or sulphur atoms, and may be, for example, a piperidino, piperazino, morpholino or thiamorpholino ring. Substituted carboxyl groups may have the formula 7 7COOR , where R is an aliphatic, araliphatic or aromatic group, while substituted amino groups may have the formula NR5R6 as defined above, one of R and R being other than hydrogen. Substituted hydroxy groups include acylated and etherified hydroxy groups O.COR and OR 7 5 6 7 where R is as defined above. The groups R , R and R may thus be C 1 4 alkyl groups e.g. methyl. The salts according to the invention include carboxyl late salts where R is carboxyl including internal salts,e.g. zwitterions,when R1 carries a basic group also included are quaternary ammonium salts and acid addition salts of R1 56 compounds in which R carries a basic group NH2 or NR R The carboxylate salts according to the invention include salts with inorganic bases, such as alkali metal salts e.g. sodium, potassium and lithium salts alkaline earth metal salts e.g. calcium and magnesium salts and ammonium salts, as well as salts with organic bases, for example substituted ammonium salts e.g. salts with amines . in general, the acids, salts and metabolically labile esters of the compounds of the invention are pre ferred forms for use in medicine. However, the other esters are also useful and, for example, where the ester grouping is readily cleaved e.g. by hydrolysis or hydrogenolysis, without significant degradation of the rest of the molecule, the esters are especially useful as carboxylprotected derivatives of the parent compounds. Those esters which are readily cleaved and are primarily of use in this connection include arylmethyl esters, especially the benzyl, o or p nitrobenzyl, benzhydryl aid trityl esters as well as the stannyl, e.g. tri n butyl stannyl and silyl esters and l alkoxyalkyl e.g. methoxymethyl esters. As indicated above, the ester grouping may be metabolically labile, i.e. it may be converted into the carboxylic acid during general metabolic processes e.g. in the blood or liver.Metabolically labile esters include substituted alkyl esters carrying an oxygen substituent on the a carbon atom for example acyloxyalkyl, e.g. acetoxymethyl and pivaloyloxymethyl, esters a a Iko xycarbonylo xyalkyl esters such as carbonyloxyethyl esters and phthalidyl esters. The acids, salts and metabolically lakiLe esters of the compounds of formula I are generally active against a range of gram positive and gram negative microorganisms, for example against strains of Staphylococcus aureus,Micrococcus species, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium,Shigella sonnei, Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus faecalis, Klebsiella aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens,Providence species and Haemophilus influenzae. The compounds have also been found stable to the action of ss lactamases produced by gram positive organisms e.g. Staphylococcus aureus and gram negative organisms e.g. nterobacter cloacae, and further have the ability to inhibit 0 lactamases produced by gram negative organisms e.g. Enterobacter cloacae. According to a further feature of the invention, we provide pharmaceutical compositions including veterinary compositions containing at least one of the acids, physiologically acceptable salts or metabolically labile esters of formula I . The compositions may contain further p lactam antibiotics. The compositions will normally also contain a pharmaceutical including veter inary carrier or excipient. The compositions of the invention include those in a form adapted for oral or parenteral use. The compositions may, for example, take the form of powders, tablets, capsules, lozenges, solutions and syrups suitable for oral administration, and may include, for example, starch, lactose, talc, magnesium stearate, gelatin, distilled water and suspending, dispersing, emulsifying, flavouring or colouring agents. The compounds may further be formulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas. The compounds of formula I may be formulated for parenteral administration e.g. for injection. The compounds may thus be formulated in ampoules for reconstitution before use. The active compounds of the invention will generally be administered to humans at a total daily dosage level of 50 mg to 20 g, preferably from 100 mg to 10 g, advantageously 250 mg to 5 g, which may be in divided doses given 1 4 times per day. Dosage units will in general contain 12.5 mg to 5g, preferably 50 mg to 1 g of active compound according to the invention. Active compounds of the invention may be of use in treating a variety of diseases in humans and animals, caused by pathogenic bacteria, such as respiratory tract or urinary tract infections. The compounds of formula I may be prepared in a variety of ways. Thus, according to one feature of the invention, we provide a process for the preparation of a compound of formula I which comprises isomerising a compound of formula II EMI7.1 wherein R and RÚ are as defined above for example by treatment with a base whereby the compound o ul I is obtained followed by deesterification and salt formation where required. In general, R is preferably an esterifiAffi carboxyl group. The base used in the isomerisation will desirably have the formula RXRYRZN , where Rx, Ry and Rê, which may be the same or different, may each represent an aliphatic, araliphatic or aromatic group e.g. alkyl groups having up to eight carbon atoms aralkyl groups having up to six carbon atoms in the alkyl portion, or aryl groups, such aryl and aralkyl groups desirably being monocyclic, and including also cycloaliphatic e.g. C37 cycloalkyl groups x or compounds wherein two of P. RY and RZ form, together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, a five , six or seven membered heterocyclic ring optionally containing a further heteroatom e.g. an oxygen or sulphur atom as in N alkyl piperidine or N alkyl morpholine, or, wherein Rx, RY and RZ form, together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, a mnnocyclic or polycyclic e.g. bicyclic heterocyclic ring system for example quinuclidine or 1,5 diazabicyclo 4.3.0 non 5 ene. Triethylamine or 1,5 diazabicyclo 4.3.0 non 5 ene are preferred bases. In general, the base used in the isomerisation should not result in any undesirable disruption of the bicyclic ring system of the starting material or product and it is preferred to use as weak a base as possible which is effective in the reaction. This preference applies generally to those reactions described herein which involve use of a base. Reaction will desirably be carried out in a suitable inert solvent. Such solvents will preferably have some degree of polarity and include esters e.g. ethyl acetate, ethers e.g. tetrahydrofuran, ketones e.g. acetone, amides e.g. dimethylformamide or halogenated hydrocarbons e.g. 1,2 dichloroethane or chloroform. Reaction will desirably be effected at around ambient temperature, e.g. 0 to 300C. The compounds of formula 11 , as defined above, together with salts thereof.as defined above, are novel compounds and constitute.another aspect of this invention. The compounds of formula II may exist as individual 3 position and 5 position epimers as well as geometrical isomers with respect to the 2 position exocyclic double bond and the invention extends to all the isomers of the compounds individually or in admixture. According to a further aspect of the invention, we provide a process for the preparation of compounds of formula II as defined above wherein a diene compound of formula III EMI9.1 wherein RE is an esterified carDcxyl group, with a sulphur nucleophile in the presence sf a base or with a salt of the sulphur nucleophile and, where necessary a proton source, e.g. water, an alcohol or carboxylic acid e.g. acetic acid or ammonium chloride, whereby a compound of formula II is obtained, followed by deesterification and salt formation where required. The sulphur nucleophile will in general be a compound of the formula RÚH where R1 has the above meaning.Where a salt of the sulphur nucleophile is used, this may, for example, be an alkali metal e.g. sodium, potassium or lithium , alkaline earth metal, ammonium or substituted ammonium salt. Suitable bases for use in the reaction with the sulphur nucleophile include tertiary amines of the formula NRXRYRZ as defined above. Preferred organic bases include trialkylamines preferably having 1 6 carbon atoms in each alkyl group, especially methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl groups, and triethylamine is convenient. Other bases which may be used in the reaction with the sulphur nucleophile include alkali metal hydrides, alkoxides, dialkylamides, disilylamides, alkyls and aryls e.g. sodium, potassium or lithium hydrides or alkoxides or lithium dialkylamides, disilylamides, alkyls or aryls. The above reaction will desirably be effected at or below ambient temperature, e.g. from 80 C to 40 C, e.g.from 200 to 200C in solution in an inert solvent e.g.a halogenated hydrocarbon, such as dichloromethane a substituted amide, such as dim ethyl formamide an ether such as tetrahydrofuran or an ester, such as ethyl acetate. In a preferred embodiment of the reaction, however, the sulphur nucleophile in the presence of an inorganic base or a salt of the sulphur nucleophile may be reacted with the diene of formula III in a suitable aprotic liquid medium, e.g. a halogenated hydrocarbon solvent, containing a crown ether. A crown ether is a macrocyclic polyether, e.g. a number of ethyleneoxy units joined to form a ring, the internal diameter of the ring being approximately that of a particular metal ion. In general 6 ethyleneoxy units 18 crown 6 are suitable to entrain a potassium ion while 5 ethyleneoxy units 15 crown 5 are suitable for sodium. Some of the ethylene groups in such crown ethers may be replaced by other diva lent units such as o phenylene or 1,2 cyclohexylene units. The inorganic base may, for example, be an alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide, carbonate or bicarbonate, e.g. potassium carbonate. When one or more of the reactants, for example the base or the salt of the sulphur nucleophile, is not soluble in the solvent in which the reaction takes place, a phase transfer reagent, for example a crown ether, may also be used to effect transfer of the reactant or reactants from the solid phase to the liquid phase or between two liquid phases. A preferred single liquid phase system is dichloromethane with potassium carbonate l8 crown 6. A preferred temperature range is O to 4O0C. R1 Where R represents an SH group, the sulphur nucleophile may alternatively be a trithiocarbonate salt, which generates trithiocarbonate ions as the sulphur nucleophile, followed by decomposition of the trithiocarbonate addition product, e.g. by using an acid such as hydrochloric acid, to yield the required SM compound.The trithiocarbonate salt may, for example, be an alkali metal, alkaline earth metal or ammonium salt or a substituted ammonium salt. Under certain conditions, particularly when using tertiary organic bases such as triethylamine or 1,5 diazabicyclo 4.3.0 non 5 ene, the compound of formula II initially produced may isomerise directly to a compound of formula I . Where it is desired to isolate the compound of formula II , it is preferred to use a crown ether with an inorganic base in the reaction with the sulphur nucleophile however, where a tertiary organic base is used, it may be preferable to use a limited quantity of base, for example only a catalytic amount, and to isolate the compound of formula II as soon as possible after its formation. Where direct conversion of a compound of formula III into a compound of formula I is desirable this may in general be achieved by using more vigorous reaction conditions than used for production of a compound of formula II , e.g. a stronger base, a longer reaction time or a higher temperature or a combination of these. It will be appreciated that conversion of a compound of formula III into a compound of formula II involves the formation of a new chiral centre and the possibility of geometrical isomerism about the newly formed exocyclic double bond Both epzmers may be formed at the new chiral centre, however those isomers having the hydrogen atoms at carbon atoms 3 and 5 in the penam ring system in the cisconfiguration i.e. the 3R, 5R and 3S, 5S isomers tend to be unstable relative to the corresponding trans isomers i.e. the 3S, 5R and 3R, 5S isomers . Thus the 3,5 transisomers tend to be the major or sole products of the reaction. As the chirality of the carbon atom at the 3 position of the penam ring system is lost when the exocyclic double bond is moved into the ring to form the penem ring system i.e. the conversion of into I the possibility of additional isomerism in compounds of formula II is of no consequence. The initial product is generally an ester of formula I or formula II and where a different ester or a carboxylic acid product or salt thereof is required, the compound of formula I or formula II prepared may be deesterified and, if desired, reesterified by methods described below. Where an acid of formula I or formula II is to be prepared, it is preferred to employ a starting material, the ester group of which may subsequently readily be cleaved e.g. an arylmethyl ester, for example a benzyl, benzhydryl, trityl or nitrobenzyl ester. Cleavage of such an arylmethyl ester, e.g. a nitrobenzyl ester, may be effected by hydrogenolysis for example using a metal catalyst, e.g. a noble metal such as platinum, palladium or rhodium. The catalyst may be supported e.g. on charcoal or kieselguhr. A E nitrobenzyl group may also be removed by reduction of the nitro group e.g. using a dissolving metal reducing agent such as zinc in acetic acid, or zinc in aqueous tetrahydrofuran or acetone controlled, for example, in the pH range 3 6, preferably 4.0 5.5 by the addition of aqueous hydrochloric acid aluminium amalgam in a moist ether, e.g.tetrahydrofuran or iron and ammonium chloride in an aqueous ether e.g. tetrahydrofuran followed by hydrolysis either under the reduction conditions or by subsequent treatment with acid. A nitrobenzyl ester can also be cleaved under alkaline conditions using, for example, sodium sulphide in a solvent such as aqueous tetrahydrofuran, dimethyl formamide or acetone. Alternatively, a stannyl or silyl ester can be cleaved by very mild solvolysis, e.g. by reaction with water, alcohols, phenols or carboxylic acids, e.g. acetic acid. Where a salt of an acid of formula I or formula II is required, the acid may be reacted with a suitable base, solvents and reaction conditions preferably being chosen to favour precipitation of the desired salt. Thus, for example, in the formation of alkali metal salts, e.g.sodium or potassium salts, it is preferred to add to a solution of the acid in a solvent such as ethyl acetate, an alkali metal alkanoate, e.g. a 2 ethylhexanoate. The resulting thio compound may be isolated and purified by conventional techniques. Where the initial product of formula I or II is a thiol RÚ SH the compounds in which RÚ is other than SH may be obtained therefrom by reaction with an alkylating or acylating agent. The term alkylating agent is used herein also to include reagents serving to introduce substituted alkyl groups such as hydroxyalkyl, azidoalkyl, aminoalkyl, substituted aminoalkyl, cyanoalkyl, alkoxyalkyl and aralkyl groups as well as cycloalkyl groups or heterocyclic groups.Suitable alkylating agents include alkyl halides e.g.methyl or ethyl iodide, or benzyl bromide, or alkyl sulphates e.g. dimethyl sulphate these reagents are reacted in the presence of a base. It is convenient to conduct the reaction using for example an inorganic base such as potassium carbonate in a halogenated hydrocarbon solvent e.g. dichloromethane, containing a crown ether.Also useful for introduction of substituted alkyl groups are alkyl or substituted alkyl vinyl ethers, e.g. ethyl vinyl ether, as well as cyclic vinyl ethers such as dihydropyran, or alkylenedialkyl ammonium salts such as methylenedimethylammonium iodide. Suitable acylating agents include compounds of the 4 formula R .C Y.E where E is a readily eliminatable substituent e.g. halogen or acyloxy and R4 and Y are as defined above. This reaction is desirably carried out in the presence of an acid binding agent e.g. pyridine. The diene compounds of formula III and the parent acids E having a carboxyl group in place of R may be prepared by treat ment of compounds of formula EMI16.1 wherein R is as defined above, preferably an esterified carboxyl group, and X is a readily eliminatable substituent, e.g. a sulphonyloxy group, with a base. The base employed will preferably be a tertiary amine. Suitable amines will include compounds of the formula NRXRYRZ as defined above. Preferred bases include trialkylamines preferably having 1 6 carbon atoms in each alkyl group, especially methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl groups, and triethylamine is particularly suitable. Pyridine may also be used. Reaction will generally be effected in a suitable aprotic inert solvent. Such solvents will preferably have some degree of polarity and include esters e.g. ethyl acetate, ethers e.g. tetrahydrofuran or dioxan, ketones e.g. acetone, amides e.g. dimethylformamide, hydrocarbons e.g. benzene, halogenated hydrocarbons e.g. dichloromethane or 1,2 dichloroethane, sulphoxides e.g. dimethylsulphoxide or sulphones e.g. sulpholane. Reaction may be effected at a low or moderate temperature e.g. a temperature in the range 300C to 80 C preferably from 0 C to 50 C. As indicated above, the readily eliminatable substituent X may be a sulphonyloxy group, OSO2RA, where the group RA represents an aliphatic, aliphatic or aromatic group. When P is an aliphatic group, it may represent a straight or branched unsubstituted or substituted alkyl or alkenyl group, preferably having from 1 8 carbon atoms, for example a methyl, ethyl, propyl or isopropyl, butyl, sec butyl, tert butyl or allyl group, optional substituents being for example, one or more alkoxy e.g. methoxy groups or halogen e.g. fluorine or chlorine atoms when RA represents an araliphatic group, it may represent an aralkyl group having up to 20 carbon atoms especially an arylmethyl group e.g. a benzyl or substituted benzyl group, suitable substituents being halo e.g.chloro nitro e.g. o or p nitro cyano alkoxy e.g. methoxy or alkyl e.g. methyl groups when RA represents an aromatic group, it may represent an aryl group having up to 12 carbon atoms e.g.a phenyl or substituted phenyl group, suitable substituents being halo e.g. chloro nitro e.g. o or.2 nitro cyano alkoxy e.g. methoxy or alkyl e.g. p methyl groups. Preferred groups RA include methyl, trifluoromethyl, phenyl or p tolyl, the methyl and p tolyl groups being especially preferred. It may be convenient to convert the compound of formula IV into a compound of formula I or II without isolation of the diene of formula III . Introduction of a sulphonyloxy group as an eliminatable substituent X may readily be carried out by reaction of the compound of formula V EMI18.1 wherein R is as defined above, prPfer,ably an esterified carboxyl group with a hydrocarbon sulphonylating agent. The sulphonylating agent may, for example, A be a sulphonyl halide or anhidrode R .9O .Z, wherein RA is as defined above and Z is a halogen, e.g.chlorine, bromine or iodine atom, or a sulphonyloxy group, preferably of the formula OSOiR A React ion will preferably be carried out in the presence of a hydrogen halide acceptor when a sulphonyl halide is employed as the sulphonylating agent. The hydrogen halide acceptor will preferably be a tertiary organic base, for example a compound of formula NRXRYRZ as defined above, e.g. a tertiary amine such as a trialkylamine, especially triethylamine, or pyridine. Where the sulphonyloxy derivative of formula IV is to be isolated a significant excess of the hydrogen halide acceptor should not be present, and the reaction will generally be effected at a temperature of from 8O0C to 300C, desirably 40 to OOC. Reaction will desirably be effected in an inert solvent, for example an ether e.g. tetrahydrofuran or dioxan, an ester e.g. ethyl acetate, a hydrocarbon e.g.benzene or a chlorinated hydrocarbon e.g. dichloromethane or 1,2 dichloroethane. In view of the ease with which the sulphonyloxy compounds of formula IRt may be converted into the diene, it may be convenient not to isolate the sulphonyloxy compound when it is formed but convert it into the corresponding diene compound of formula III in situ either by addition of further base, or by raising the temperature, or a combination of these methods. The base employed will preferably be a tertiary organic base e.g. a tertiary amine base RXRYRzN as defined above. Alternatively, the sulphonylation reaction can be carried out under conditions favouring elimination of the sulphonyloxy group initially introduced, for example at a temperature in the range 10 to 350, and or using an excess of base, for example a trialkylamine. According to a further embodiment of the invention the compounds of formula I , other than those in which R1 represents SH, may be prepared from compounds of formula VI EMI19.1 wherein RE represents an esterified carboxyl group, RIa is the residue of a sulphur nucleophile other than SM, Q is a readily replaceable substituent, Rx, Ry and Rê are as defined above and AG zis an anion by reaction thereof with hydrogen sulphide in the presence of a base or with a hydrosulphide or sulphide salt, followed, by heating to effect cyclisation to the compound of formula I and, where a free acid or salt is desired, by UeesterificaLion and subsequent salt formation. The base may be an inorg l7c or organic vase.Preferred bases for use in the reaction are, for example, tertiary amine bases which may be of the forr,ula N XRYR as defined above e.g. trialkylamines wherein the alkyl groups have e.g. 1 4 carbon atoms such as triethylamine or hindered bases e.g. 3 azabicylco 3.2.2 nonane. The sulphide or hydrosulphide salt may, for example, be an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salt such as, e.g. a sodium, potassium or calcium salt or a quaternary ammonium salt. The reaction with hydrogen sulphide or a salt thereof is preferably effected at a temperature in the range 30 to 300. The cyclisation reaction is preferably effected at a temperature above 40 C for example in the range 500 to 1000C. Reaction is preferably carried out in an inert liquid medium, which may be an inert solvent such as an ether, e.g. tetrahydrofuran or dioxan an ester, e.g.ethylacetate or a chlorinated hydrocarbon, e.g. 1,2dichloroethane. The readily replaceable substituent Q in the compound of formula VI may for example, be a halogen e.g. chlorine atom or an acylated hydroxy group, such as an aliphatic, aromatic or araliphatic carbonyloxy, sulphonyloxy or phosphinyloxy group, containing for example 1 20 carbon atoms. The aliphatic or aromatic grouping of such a sulphonyloxy group may for example be an alkyl e.g. C1 8 group, which may be substitu ted by one or more halogen atoms e.g. fluorine or chlorine, or an aryl e.g. C g15 group which may carry alkyl, e.g.methyl, alkoxy e.g. methoxy or halogen e.g. bromine substituents. The aliphatic or aromatic grouping of such a carbonyloxy group may be, for example, an alkyl group e.g. C1 8 optionally substituted by one or more halogen atoms, or an aryl e.g. C6 15 group, optionally substi tuted by for example, one or more halogen atoms or nitro groups. Q is preferably the residue of an acid QH having a pKa in water at 250C of 3.5 or less. Preferred groups Q include mesyloxy, trifluoro methanesulphonyloxy, tosyloxy and phenylsulphonyloxy. Q in the compounds of formula VI is conveniently mesy loxy. Rx, RY and R each preferably represent a C16 alkyl group, especially a methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl group the triethylammonium group is particularly preferred. Following the reaction with the hydrogen sulphide or sulphide salt it may be possible to isolate a thioenolate of the formula VII EMI21.1 where RE RI a,RX,RY, and RZ have the above meanings . On heating, e.g. in a solvent such as ethyl acetate or 1,2 dichloroethane, compound of formula VII cyclises to the desired penem of SOnmss I . The compounds of formulate tI and VII as defined above i novel compounds and constitute a further feature of the invention. The compounds of formula VI may be prepared from compound of formula VIII EMI22.1 wherein Rla, RE,Rx,Ry and Rz are as defined above by reaction with one or more reagents serving to introduce the readily replaceable substituent Q, for example by replacing the enolic hydroxyl group by a halogen atom or converting it into an acyloxy group. The reagent serving to replace the hydroxyl group by a halogen atom may, for example, be a Vilsmeier reagent prepared from, for example, dimethylformamide a .d phosphorus trichloride. Compounds of formula VI in which Q is an acyloxy group may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula VIII with an appropriate acylating agent, e.g. an acyl halide or anhydride. Such an acyl halide will desirably be a hydrocarbon sulphonyl halide wherein the hydrocarbon sulphonyl portion is as defined above. Thus the compound of formula VIII may be reacted with an alkane sulphonyl halide, for example methanesulphonyl halide or p toluene sulphonyi halide. Reaction is normally carried out in a solvent, e.g. an ether such as diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran or a halogenated hydrocarbon such as methylene chloride or 1,2 dichloroethane. The reaction will normally be effected in the presence of an acid binding agent, e.g. a tertiary amine which may have the formula NR RYR as defined above, such as triethylamine, pyridine or collidine, or an oxirane such as propylene oxide. If liquid, the acid binding agent may, if suitable, serve as a solvent. It is sensible to convert a compound of formula VIII into the compound of formula I without isolation of any intermediate.Thus, for example, mesylation of a compound of formula VIII using mesyl chloride in pyridine may be followed by an in situ cyclisation reaction by addition of an excess of triethylamine and passing in hydrogen sulphide helping, e.g. to about 70 C, completes the reaction. The initial product in the above reaction sequences is normally an ester of formula I and if an acid product or salt is required for further processing, the ester should subsequently be cleaved as described above. Similarly, where an acid or salt of formula II , III or IV is required and an ester is initially produced, such cleavage may be carried out, appropriate methods being selected to avoid unwanted reactions such as reduction of double bonds. If desired, such acids or salts may be re esterified to introduce a different ester grouping. Esters of the acids of formulae I , II , III or IV may be prepared by reaction of the acid with an alcohol, phenol, silanol or stannanol or a reactive derivative thereof to form the desired ester Deaf ion ilI effected under mild conditions in order to prevent rupture of the bicyclic nucleus. The use rel ral or mild acidic or basic conditions therefore, nt temperatures between 70 and 35 C is preferred. The alkyl, alkoxyalkyl and aralkyl esters may be prepared by reaction of the acid with the 2pproHriate diazoalkane or diazoaralkane e.g. diazomethane or diphenyl diazcmethane. The reaction will generally be effected in an ether, ester or a halohydrocarbon solvent, e.g. diethyl ether, ethyl acetate or dichloromethane. In general, reduced temperatures are preferred, for example, 15 to 15 C is preferred. The esters derived from alcohols may also be produced by reaction of a reactive derivative of the alcohol, for example, a halide such as the chloride, bromide or iodide, or a hydrocarbonsulphonyl derivative such as a mesyl or tosyl ester, with a salt of the acid e.g. an alkali or alkaline earth metal salt such as a lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium or barium salt or an amine salt, such as triethylammonium salt. This reaction is preferably carried out in a substituted sulphoxide or amide solvent e.g. dimethyl sulphoxide, dimethylformamide or hexamethylphosphoramide. Alternatively, the esters may be prepared by reaction of the acid with the alcohol in the presence of a condensing agent such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. Stannyl esters may conveniently be formed by reaction of the carboxylic acid or a salt thereof with reactive tetravalent tin moieties. Trialkyl tin oxides are preferred for the synthesis of tin compounds in view of their availability and low toxicity. Silyl esters of the acid may be formed by reaction with a reactive tetravalent silicon moiety. Trialkylsilyl halides and mono or bis silylated acetamides are preferred as silylating agents. Proton acceptors e.g. weak bases such as pyridine may often be used with advantage when hydrogen halides are formed during such esterification. The compounds of formula V whence compounds of the invention may be prepared, may be prepared by the methods described in our South African Patent No. 78 398G, The compounds of formula VIII may be prepared by the methods described in our Belgian Patent No.858516. According to a further feature of the invention, we provide vinyl compounds of formula IIIA EMI25.1 in which R is a carboxyl or esterified carboxyl group, and salts thereof. These compounds are of use not only in the production of compounds of formula I as described above, but also in the production of 2 ethylpenems of the formula IX EMI25.2 described in our South African Patent No. 78 3986. Thus, the above 2 ethylpenems may be prepared from the compounds of formula IIIA by reduction of the vinyl group thereof to an ethyl group, e.g. mild catalytic hydrogenation. Such reduction constitutes a further featurc of the invention. The hydrogenation catalyst is normally a noblegmetal catalyst, e.g. palladium,, platinum or rhodium. The catalyst may be supported e.g. on charcoal or kieselguhr the metal catalyst is preferably palladium e.g. as 10 palladium on charcoal. Suitable solvents for the hydrogenation include ethers such as tetrahydrofuran esters such as ethyl acetate ketones such as acetone amides such as dimethylformamide or halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride. Where an ester of the diene is used as starting material and the ester grouping is susceptible to catalytic hydrogenolysis, the free acid of the 2 ethylpenem will be normally obtained. This may, if desired, be subjected to reesterification or salt formation by the above methods. The invention additionally provides compounds of formula IV , where P and X have the above meanings, X being most preferably a group O.SO2RA as defined above. In the compounds of formula IIIA and IV the group R preferably represents an esterified carboxyl 2 group COOP in which R2 is a readily cleavable group such as a benzyl, nitrobenzyl, o nitrobenzyl or methoxymethyl group. The invention also includes the sulphides of the compound of or formulae I , II , IIIA and IV , wherein the ring sulphur atom is replaced by SO. These sulphoxides may be prepared from their corresponding sulphides by oxidation, for example using a peracid such as peracetic monoperphthalic, m chloroperbenzoic or metaperiodic acid preferably in the presence of an organic solvent such as acetic acid or dichloromethane. Preferred temperatures are not greater than 10 C e.g. OOC. Under these conditions a group SR3 in compounds of formulae I and II will 3 normally also be converted into a group SOP The invention will now be more particularly described by the following Examples and Preparations, which should not be taken as limiting the invention. Throughout theExamples and Preparations all temperatures are given in C, The stereochemical designation SRS implies a racemic mixture of the 5R and 5S isomers.
