# Improvements in tabletting machines and in dies for tabletting machines.

## Abstract
A tabletting machine having a ring shaped die table 25, 33, 27 rotatable about a generally upwardly extending axis 11 and having dies 40 arranged in bores in a die surface 38 . Radially outer punches 16 , supported in the die table 25 and reciprocably driven by a cam track 52 with respect to the dies 40 , co operate with radiatly inner punches 83 semi rigidly mounted on a rotatable hub 23 to form and eject tablets from the dies. The hub 23 is rotated about an axis 10 , parallel to the die table axis 11 , and moves the radially inner punches 83 in a circular path to enter and exit the dies 40 in a predetermined sequence. A feed plate 102, 144, 146, 147 , onto which tabletting ma terial is supplied, directs the material onto distribution vanes 108 and thence into the dies 40 . Individual pump means 50, 46 associated with the radially outer punches 16 and means 154, 155 for catching and extract ing loose tabletting material falling from the dies serve to reduce contamination of the moving parts of the machine by the tabletting material.
