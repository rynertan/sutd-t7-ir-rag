# Centrifuge rotor apparatus for preparing particle spreads.

## Abstract
A centrifuge rotor is described which facilitates the prep aration of cell dispersions on microscope slides. The rotor 44 is bowl like in configuration and defines plural peripheral regions adapted to receive the slides 50 and a removable sample chamber associated with each slide 50 . Each chamber has an outlet adapted to contact its slide. A sample, containing blood cells, for example, may be placed in a chamber and the cells centrifugally sedimented against the slide associated therewith. Excess or unwanted fluid is removed from the chamber by applying a vacuum through a vacuum line 100 and hollow drive shaft 26 . Leaf springs 94 maintain each chamber in position and the vacuum line 100 in fluid contact with the chamber. The vacuum line 100 connecting each chamber cooperates with its leaf spring 94 such that if a chamber is missing, the leaf spring closes the vacuum line.
