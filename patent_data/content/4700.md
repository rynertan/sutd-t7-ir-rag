# Gaseous discharge display system.

## Abstract
This invention concerns a gaseous discharge display system. In an embodiment of the invention, a plasma discharge display panel 10 is operated at a high frequency above the response range of the inherent wall charge storage phenomenon and uses refreshing to maintain the display. The vertical drive selection includes a pair of shift registers 15, 19 operated in parallel into which data from a host or associated controller is loaded, with an individual driver associated with each register stage. The horizontal lines are addressed through associated shift registers 29, 31 in an interlace sequence to generate a display on a horizontal scan basis. The horizontal drivers 31, 33 are referenced at the level and frequency of the high frequency energizing signals, while the vertical drivers 21, 23 are selectively set to ground or a positive a.c. voltage according to the state of associated register stages. By using the high frequency signal in the horizontal axis as a floating reference and using novel selection techniques, the display is operated by low voltage signals. The normal sustain and erase operations associated with conventional plasma discharge panels are eliminated, while the write operation does not require either the precise timing or logical considerations associated with the selective operation of conventional plasma discharge display panels. The low voltage drive requirements permits use of low voltage driver circuitry which is susceptible to low cost monolithic fabrication techniques.
