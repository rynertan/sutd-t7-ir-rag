# Homokinetic coupling.

## Abstract
A homokinetic coupling having tarque transmitting balls 3 with flat faces 13 in contact with curved surfaces 11 of guide grooves 10 of one e.g. the inner coupling ring 2 . Under load the balls adopt the most effective power transmit ting positions. The inner and outer coupling rings may have ball retaining means 20,21 .
