# ELECTRODE FOR ARC FURNACES

## Abstract
Electrode for arc furnaces, comprising a water cooled upper section of metal and a replaceable lower section of consumable material, which are connected by means of a threaded nipple or the like. To obtain signals which inform on the presence of the consumable section, there is at least one light receiving element 11 located in the connection zone 21 of the cooled metal shaft 2 and the consumable section 3 . The light signal falling on the light receiving element 11 in the absence of the consumable section 3 is passed in an appropriate manner via a light wave guide 13 to the furnace control which releases the safety system.
