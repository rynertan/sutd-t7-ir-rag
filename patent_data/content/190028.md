## Description
This invention relates to packaging of seafood and the thermal processing of shrimp and other seafoods, which at present have to be heavily salted to retain their texture during commercial sterilization processing and storage. Some seafood has to be heavily salted prior to being thermally processed in order to retain an acceptable texture. By thermal processing is meant the seafood has been subjected to a time temperature parameter which results in a commercially sterilized food, as defined in U.S. Title 21 CFR Part 113 Definitions, Sec. 113.3 as follows Texture herein generically refers to firmness in relation to touch and bite, and to material consistency and physical integrity. According to the present state of the art, if salt is not used, there is a loss of texture resulting in lack of firmness and resistance to one s bite which is deemed unacceptable by many people. From the moment of the death of a fish, e.g., the shrimp there is a deterioration in texture due to enzymatic and bacterial action. The result is a breakdown of the connective tissue. Although enzymatic action is terminated by the blanching process, shrimp are extremely heat sensitive and further loss of texture occurs due to the elevated temperatures involved in thermal processing. Conventionally, a heavy dosage of salt is added to preserve the texture of the blanched shrimp which would otherwise be lost during thermal processing. To enhance texture retention, some seafoods such as shrimp are presently heavily salted both during the blanch and also in brine immediately prior to thermal processing. Usually, there is 5 by weight sodium chloride in the brine. The salt in neither the blanch nor the brine serves the role of a food preservative. The consumer ordinarily removes some salt from the seafood by a water wash or leach before the product is served. Nonetheless, a considerable amount of salt is or may be retained in the seafood, in a quantity which many medical authorities consider inimical to health, notably inducement of hypertension due to sodium retention. Proteinaceous foods such as seafoods contain sulfur compounds which break down when heated to form hydrogen sulfide. The reaction of the hydrogen sulfide with exposed metal often produces a dark discoloration found in cans of protein containing foods. Although the dark sulfide compound formed is harmless to health, it detracts from the appearance of the can and when transferred to the product detracts from the appearance of the product. Scientific studies have shown that the amount of sulfide released from seafood during thermal processing can be related to the acidity of the product. Seafoods, and particularly shell fish, have a tendency toward rapid degradation and a resultant high pH. Good handling conditions such as prompt icing and rapid processing are very important since they affect pH level and sulfide formation. Acidification reduces the pH and the consequent likelihood of black iron sulfide formation. Citric acid is frequently added to the brine by shrimp canners in an attempt to inhibit sulfide build up and consequent product discoloration, but treatment with citric acid does not always fully inhibit build up. This build up is most likely to occur at the side seam of a three piece metal can, or at the countersink area, or on the profile rings of the container end. The present invention aims to produce canned seafood, for example shrimp, which compares favorably with the fresh or frozen product which is not thermally processed. We seek, for example, to retain the texture of seafood, during thermal processing and storage by a treatment which avoids heavy salting, whereby soaking or washing to rid the seafood of excessive salt before eating can be avoided, and whereby flavor close to that of the fresh product, unimpaired by salt, can be achieved. The invention involves combining a hydrolysis mixture of an aldonic acid and its lactones with the seafood to be processed. A particularly preferred acid is gluconic acid which replaces salt for texturing. By use of the invention, a reduction in discoloration of the seafood and of the metal can in which the seafood may be packed can be gained, and where the seafood is commercially sterilized shrimp, it can have a clean shrimp flavor and odor. Practice of this invention eliminates the need for or the use of citric acid in brine to reduce black iron sulfide formation and consequent product discoloration. When glucono delta lactone is hydrolyzed to gluconic acid, the gluconic acid can perform the same inhibiting action as citric acid. Thus, when GDL is used alone in the brine, neither salt nor citric acid needs to be included since the gluconic acid formed from hydrolysis of the GDL performs these texturing and inhibiting functions. The use of glucono delta lactone has previously been disclosed in US A 4 262 027 in relation to the formation of meat emulsions. According to the present invention, there is provided a hermetically sealed package containing seafood normally processed in a salt containing brine to maintain texture, which seafood has been thermally processed to commercial sterility together with a brine containing a hydrolysis mixture of an aldonic acid and its lactones or a precursor thereof in water and a lesser amount of salt than is normally employed to maintain texture, said mixture being present in an amount adequate to have maintained the texture of the seafood during thermal processing, at least one of the flavor, color or odor properties of the seafood being improved compared to the same seafood similarly processed without said hydrolysis mixture or precursor thereof in a brine containing the amount of salt normally employed for processing the seafocd. The invention also provides a method of processing seafood normally processed in a salt containing brine to maintain texture, which method comprises combining the seafood in a brine containing a hydrolysis mixture of an aldonic acid and its lactones or a precursor thereof in water, and a lesser amount of salt than is normally employed to maintain texture, hermetically sealing the combined foodstuff in a container and thermally processing the seafood to commercial sterility, the amount of hydrolysis mixture or a precursor thereof being such that the texture of the seafood is maintained during such thermal processing, at least one of the flavor, color or odor properties of the seafood being improved compared to the same seafood commercially sterilized without said hydrolysis mixture or precursor thereof in a brine containing the amount of salt normally employed for processing the seafood. Further, the invention provides a method of maintaining the texture of freshly harvested seafood normally processed in a salt containing brine to maintain texture during thermal processing of the seafood to commercial sterility, which method comprises combining the seafood with a brine containing a hydrolysis mixture of an aldonic acid and its lactones or a precursor thereof in water, and a lesser amount of salt than is normally employed to maintain texture, hermetically sealing the combined foodstuff in a container and thermally processing the seafood to commercial sterility, the amount of hydrolysis mixture or precursor thereof being such that the texture of the seafood is maintained during such thermal processing, and at least one of the flavor, color or odor properties of the seafood being improved compared to the same seafood thermally processed without said hydrolysis mixture or precursor thereof, in a brine containing the amount of salt normally employed for processing the seafood. Particular embodiments of the invention are as defined in the dependent claims. An aldonic acid, preferably gluconic acid, is found to maintain the texture of seafood, making it unnecessary to employ large amounts of salt for this purpose prior to commercial sterilization of the product. Only small amounts of gluconic acid are necessary compared to the large amounts of salt previously required. For example, in accordance with the preferred method of combining gluconic acid with Louisiana shrimp, adding 1 2 to less than 1 1 2 by weight glucono delta lactone GDL to an aqueous solution is adequate a level greater than 1 1 2 tends to reduce the appeal. A small amount of salt may still be used in the blanch before sterilizing, but this is far from the amount normally needed to maintain good texture in the canning process. When the present invention is applied to shrimp, preferably the harvested shrimp is first blanched and rinsed, and afterwards GDL is included with the contents in the container the container is then hermetically sealed and thermally processed. Because of the addition of an acid with its lactones, e.g. by combining the seafood with GDL, and the hydrolysis of the GDL to a mixture of gluconic acid and its lactones, the resulting shrimp has a texture and flavor similar to that of the fresh product. The levels and mild taste of the aldonic acids and the presence of the acid with its lactones results in a thermally processed seafood that does not have any acidic notes in flavor or aroma. The flavor is also improved by the substantial reduction in salt level. Modes of carrying out the invention are now explained in more detail in the following description which is given by way of example only. In accordance with this invention, the need for large amounts of added salt or of any added salt at all for maintaining the texture of certain seafoods, for example shrimp, through thermal processing is eliminated by combining the seafood with a mixture of an aldonic acid and its lactones, preferably gluconic acid and its lactones, and thermally processing the combination. It has been discovered that by combining a hydrolysis mixture of an aldonic acid and its lactones with seafood to be thermally processed, not only are the need for salt for texturizing and the salty taste eliminated or substantially reduced, but also the levels and mild taste of the acid present and the presence of the acid with its lactones, result in a thermally processed seafood that does not have the objectionable pungent, sharp, acidic or pickled flavor notoriously characteristic of those acids commonly used in foods. The commonly used acids include acetic, citric, lactic, malic, hydrochloric, phosphoric and tartaric. The aldonic acids which can be combined with the seafood in accordance with this invention are prepared for example by oxidation of sugars or aldoses, preferably from those having six carbon atoms, although they could be prepared from those having five carbon atoms. Those acids prepared from sugars having six carbon atoms are talonic, galactonic, idonic, gulonic, mannonic, gluconic, altronic and allonic although currently these acids, with the exception of gluconic, may be unavailable commercially . These acids are respectively derived from their aldoses talose, glactose, idose, gulose, mannose, glucose, altrose and allose. Sugars having five carbon atoms are lyxose, xylose, arabinose and ribose. Any suitable method or material can be employed to bring the hydrolysis mixture of the aldonic acid and its lactones into combination with the seafood. While the acid might be added by itself since the acid, when in contact with moisture or water in the seafood contents, will be converted to a mixture of the acid and its lactones , doing so currently does not appear practical since aldonic acids are not, so far as we know, commercially available in crystalline form or in food grade. This is the case with the preferred gluconic acid. These acids may be commercially available in technical grade in aqueous solutions. For example, gluconic acid is so available in aqueous solutions stated to be about 50 by weight gluconic acid. These aqueous solutions of the acid are equilibrium mixtures of gluconic acid, and its lactones glucono delta lactone and glucono gamma lactone. Gluconic acid has a mild acid taste. The preferred method for providing the hydrolysis mixture of the aldonic acid and its lactones to the seafood is to combine the seafood with a precursor of the aldonic acid. A precursor of the acid herein means a liquid, material or compound which adds the acid to, or forms or provides it in the seafood with which it is combined. Again, when the acid contacts moisture or water in or of the seafood, it will convert partially to and will exist with its lactones. Precursors of these acids which can be employed include their lactones themselves which can be said to be latent acids since they hydrolize in water to form a mixture of the acid and its lactones , mixtures of these lactones, and salts of the acids in combination with certain strong acids. For example, precursors of the preferred gluconic acid which can be employed include glucono delta lactone, glucono gamma lactone, mixtures of these lactones, and gluconate salts in combination with the strong acid, hydrochloric. By far, the most preferred precursor for this invention is glucono delta lactone GDL . It is commercially available in food grade as a free flowing, odorless, white powder. It has a sweet taste. Food grade solutions of GDL are also commercially available and can be employed. GDL is an inner ester of gluconic acid which when hydrolyzed forms gluconic acid. Hydrolysis occurs when GDL is combined with water, for example that of an aqueous brine or of or in the seafood. Hydrolysis of the glucono delta lactone results in an equilibrium mixture of from about 55 to about 60 by weight gluconic acid and from about 45 to about 40 by weight of a mixture glucono delta lactone and glucono gamma lactone. The rate of acid formation is affected by the temperature, the pH value and concentration of the solution. Hydrolysis of delta lactones tends to be more rapid than hydrolysis of gamma lactones. In the absence of heat, hydrolysis tends to be slow. Heating the brine accelerates the hydrolysis reaction and is the preferred method. Heating the seafood also has the same effect. Like results would be expected to occur with the use of other lactones of other aldonic acids, e.g.galactono delta lactone. Examples of those salts which can be used in combination with certain strong acids each suitable for food use , include sodium, potassium and calcium salts, for example, sodium, potassium and calcium gluconates. An example of an acid considered herein to be strong is one which will react with the acid salt and provide enough available hydrogen ions to form the desired aldonic acid in the seafood. Such an acid would by hydrochloric. Of course, the type, manner and or amount of strong acid s employed should be in keeping with the desire of this invention that a sharp, strong or objectionable acid taste is not imparted to the seafood. If hydrochloric acid is used as the strong acid, all of it should be converted so that no such acid would remain, only some derived salt. Louisiana shrimp, freshly caught, were mechanically peeled and deveined. The shrimp were of medium size which means 173.4 to 311.5 shrimps per kilogram 5.4 to 9.7 shrimps per ounce of drained product. The pH of the raw shrimp to be processed ranged from 7.1 to 7.3. The shrimp were blanched for 1 1 2 minutes at 200 F 93 C in a continuous blancher. The blanch solution was an aqueous solution containing 3.95 salt by weight and heated to 200 F 93 C . The shrimp were rinsed after the blanch to cool the shrimp and they were graded and immediately filled into cans 307 x 113 meaning 3 7 16 inches 87 mm diameter, 1 13 16 inches 46 mm high . The rinse removes some of the salt. Each can was check weighed to assure a fill weight of 4.3 oz 122 g . After filling, the commercial control cans CC, Table 1 were passed through a conventional drip lane whereby the cans were filled with a brine solution which contained 4.8 5.0 salt by weight. In accordance with the present invention the commercial brine solution was replaced with brine solutions to which had been added various amounts of GDL and 1.3 by weight salt dissolved in water. These brines were heated to 180 190 F 82 88 C and employed as the canning brine for a series of other 307 x 113 cans refer to Table 1, below . The GDL in the brines undergoes hydrolysis and thereby provides in the brine a solution of from about 55 to 60 by weight gluconic acid and a mixture of about 45 to 40 by weight glucono delta lactone and glucono gamma lactone. All cans were steam flow closed and were thermally processed in vertical still retorts. The thermal process used for the control cans and those of the present invention was a retort temperature of 261 F 143 C for 5.43 minutes. The cans were atmospherically water cooled to about 100 F 38 C after processing and both sets of cans were stored at a controlled temperature of 80 F 27 C . The objective was to monitor the differences between the various cans to which GDL had been added and the commercial control cans in terms of the sensory characteristics of odor, color, flavor and texture, based on the GDL variable. Two cans of each of the following code variables shown in Table 1 were submitted to a trained taste panel whose evaluations are given in Table 2. It was also noted by the panel that the cloudiness of the liquid brine in the can was obvious at the 1.5 GDL addition level, but barely noticeable at the 0.5 level. These liquids are termed brine in the canning industry regardless of salt content. Because of brine cloudiness at the 1.5 GDL level and the downgraded flavor, the preferred range of addition of GDL to brine for use with small and medium Louisiana shrimp according to the present invention is from about 0.5 to less than 1.5 percent by weight in water. Conceivably some GDL a fraction of a percent may be replaced by a small amount of an organic acidulant, such as citric or lactic acid, still to achieve equivalent results in accordance with this invention, and a small amount of salt NaCl may be used to boost or encourage the seafood flavor. Citric acid is not known to have ever been used to replace salt for texturing. In the amounts needed, the food product would be too strongly acidic. We have found that glucono delta lactone GDL when hydrolyzed to gluconic acid can perform the same action as citric acid in inhibiting sulfide build up and its consequences. Such build up occurs e.g. at the side seam, the counter sink area and the profile rings of container ends. Thus, when GDL is used alone in the brine, neither salt nor citric acid needs to be included since GDL performs their respective texturing and inhibiting formation.
