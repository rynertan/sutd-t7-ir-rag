# An evaporation cooled gas insulated electrical apparatus.

## Abstract
In an evaporation cooled gas insulated electrical appar atus, e.g. a transformer, a plurality of upstanding cooling ducts 10 in a coolant condenser 3 are closed at their upper ends and only a lower header 4b at the lower ends of the cooling ducts communicates with the tank 2 containing the electrical device 1 . In another embodiment, a check valve 121 and a gas pump 122 are disposed in an upper conduit 114 connecting the tank 2 to a common upper header 4a connecting the cooling ducts with each other at their upper ends so as to discharge the noncondensable gas 9 from the condenser to the tank. A sensing device 221 may be disposed to sense the interface 13 between the noncondensable gas and the vapour refrigerant in the cooling ducts, and a controller 222 may be disposed to compare the interface level sensed by the sensing device with a reference interface level set in the controller to control the gas pump so that the actual interface level is in conformity with the reference interface level.
