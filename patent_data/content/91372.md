# Electrically controlled unit injector.

## Abstract
An electrically controlled unit injector 10 for a diesel engine wherein both timing of injection and the quantity of fuel premetered into the injector are controlled by a single solenoid valve 14 . The control of the timing portion of the cycle is accomplished by a timing port 68 of the valve 14 which, when open, permits fuel to flow into the timing chamber 34 and, when closed, operates against high pressure to shut off the flow of fuel from the timing chamber 34 . The metering function is initiated by the upward travel of a metering plunger 40 in response to the upward travel of a pumping plunger 30 while the timing port 68 of the valve 14 is closed. Metering is terminated by a metering port 62 of the valve 14 which shuts off the supply of fuel to the metering chamber 36 . The timing and metering ports 68, 62 of the valve 14 are controlled by the single solenoid. Metering quantity control may be of the pressure time or volumetric metering type.
