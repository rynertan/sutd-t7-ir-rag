# Apparatus and method for compressing digital data.

## Abstract
In a method and apparatus for compressing digital data derived from an image, a prediction table, which is pregenerat ed based on a number of sample images, generates a predict ed pixel and source state for each pixel of the original image, as the original image is scanned. The predicted pixel is the ex pected value of the pixel when considering the values of a group of adjoining pixels, while the source state is indicative of the probability that the predicted pixel is in error. Prediction er ror pixels are then generated and grouped according to their respective source states to form a plurality of run length sym bols with each symbol comprising a white portion and a black portion, which symbols are stored sequentially in order of for mation in a memory device 25 according to their respective source states. The symbols are used to provide address data for a memory device 85 which generate variable length code words that are transmitted to a receiving station and decoded using the reverse of the aforementioned process to form a fac simile image.
