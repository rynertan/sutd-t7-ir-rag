# A method for the production of concentrated, frozen potato puree.

## Abstract
A method for the production of concentrated, frozen puree, especially potato puree, in which method the potatoes are first washed, peeled, cut into pieces, blanched, cooled and dewatered. The potatoes thus processed are then dried to reduce their weight by 40 60 , whereupon the potatoes are steamed and then mashed, frozen and crushed. By drying the potatoes before they are steamed, a final product of higher quality is obtained, while at the same time chemical additives, such as antioxidants, consistency agents etc., are rendered superfluous.
