# PROCESS AND APPARATUS FOR INDIRECT COOLING OF A HOT GAS

## Abstract
Process and apparatus for indirectly cooling a hot gas that contains impurities which, on cooling, deposit in the form of water soluble solids, the hot gas being passed through a heat exchanger provided with tubes. A water film flows downwards along each of the tubes, and the water flowing away from beneath the tubes is discharged from the heat exchanger. Preferably use is made of a substantially vertical heat exchanger in which the gas is passed through the tubes and the water for the water film is fed onto a substantially horizontal tube plate in the top of the heat exchanger, to which tube plate the tubes are connected such that their ends project somewhat above the tube plate.
