# DEVICE FOR PERFORMING A ROTARY MOTION

## Abstract
The invention relates to a device for performing rotation al movement and comprises a rotatable element such as a cog sector 3 or the like, arranged in a housing 1 . The sector can easily be connected to rotatable machine ele ments of various kinds by being provided with an easily exchangeable coupling element 7 which can be displaced axially through a bore in the sector and through two bearings 8, 9 and be detachably fastened to the cog sector by e.g. screws 14, 15 provided in threaded bores in the sector and abutting radially directed support surfaces in recesses in the element 7 between the bearing surfaces of the bearings 8, 9 .
