# Program blocking method for use in direct broadcast satellite system.

## Abstract
Programming tiers S₀ S₅ are authorized for viewing on an impulse pay per view basis. The system operator controls individual receiver units to block the display of programming on selected tiers because the subscriber finds the content of same objectionable or to prevent members of the household from incurring charges without the subscriber s consent. The broadcast signal includes portions addressable to particular receiver units. These portions include a designation of tiers S₁,S₄ to be blocked and a command to store same in the unit memory. Upon command to display a program on a selected tier, the memory is accessed and the stored designation compared with the selected tier. Receivers having stored designations corresponding to the selected tier are unable to display the program.
