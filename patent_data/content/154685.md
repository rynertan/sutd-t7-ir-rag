# Semiconductor memory device.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a semiconductor mem ory device comprising a semiconductor substrate 11 of a first conductivity type at least one polycrystalline silicon electrode 15 , at least one capacitor being formed between said semiconduc tor substrate 11 and said polycrystalline silicon electrode 15 and a MOS transistor formed on at least one side of said polycrystalline silicon electrode 15 . The semiconductor substrate 11 has at least one recess, and said at least one polycrystalline silicon electrode 15 is insulatively disposed over that portion of said semiconductor substrate 11 which corresponds to said recess.
