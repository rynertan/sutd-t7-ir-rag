# Perforated camouflage material.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a perforated camouflage mate rial where the holes are made as arcuate slits so that tongues are formed. The material is laminated from a carrier layer and applied thereto a plastics layer put under stress, the tongues thus curling outwards. The layer with stress can suitably be obtained by hot laminating polyethylene which has been given latent stress during manufacture, with the carrier layer, the latent stress being released into an interior stress in the laminated sheet.
