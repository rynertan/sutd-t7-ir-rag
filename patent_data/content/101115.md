## Abstract
A device for recognising and examining bank notes 20 or the like, in which a bank note is transported through a transverse light curtain, and the transmission fluctuations caused by the printed patterns are detected by means of a row of light sensitive cells, 10 the output signals thereof being stored in a matrix buffer memory 30 as a digital picture of the bank note, said picture being compared with corresponding data relating to a reference banknote of the same value permanently stored in one of a plurality of partial memories, 36a..d , the comparison results of at least a substantial part of the bank note being statistically proces sed, all this irrespective of the orientation of the bank note. Moreover the dimensions, colour and ultra violet remission of the bank note are determined, at least one of the first two measurements being suitable for determining the value of the bank note. Since the picture of the bank note is tempor arily held in the buffer memory 30 , a repeated comparison is possible, in particular in respect of different orientations of the bank note. In particular the partial memories contain only a sample relating to discrete parts arbitrarily distributed over at least a substantial part of the reference bank note.
