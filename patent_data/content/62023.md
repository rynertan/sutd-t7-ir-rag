# A BOILER

## Abstract
A boiler for heating a heat transfer medium, such as water in a domestic heating system with water carried heat. The boiler comprises a tank 2 for the radiator water a combustion chamber 3 combustion gas pipes 4 which extend down through the tank and which discharge at the bottom thereof in a collecting chamber 5 for combustion gases. At the upper part of the tank 2 there is arranged an outlet 7 to the radiators, while a tank inlet 8 from the radiators is arranged at the lower part of the tank. Also arranged in the tank 2 is a reservoir 17, 20 for heating tap water, whereat the reservoir inlet 10 for tap water is connected to a fresh cold water pipe and is located at a level which lies beneath that of the tank inlet 8 from the radiators. The tap water reservoir has a lower part 20 which is located beneath the combustion chamber in the tank, this part of the reservoir having a branch point 11 from which a first branch pipe 12 passes outside the tank to a mixer valve 13 and is arranged to supply pre heated tap water thereto, and from which a second branch pipe 14 passes to the mixer valve 13 via an upper part 17 of the tap water reservoir lying above the combustion chamber 3 , and is arranged to supply to the mixer valve tap water having a higher temperature than that of the tap water supplied by said first branch pipe 12 .
