Preliminary observations on prostaglandins date back to about 50 years ago, but only 20 years ago the first prostaglandins have been isolated and their structures have been elucidated. From then on, some methods of synthesis have been found which allowed to prepare either natural prostaglandins or analogs thereof. Prostaglandins are very interesting because of their numerous biological activities and of their potential therapeutic uses. The structural characteristic feature of prostaglandins is a ring having five Carbon atoms. The known synthetic pathways of prostaglandins comprise many functionalizations of cyclopentadiene. One of the thus obtained products is known as Corey s intermediate and has the following structural Formula EMI2.1 Corey s intermediate is useful in the synthesis of prostaglandins of any kind and its preparation has been investigated extensively. According to E.J. Corey, the Compound of Formula II is prepared through the following steps a alkylation of cyclopentadiene with benzylchloromethylether in the presence of thallium salts b reaction of the thus obtained compound with 1 chloro acry loyl chloride according to the Diels Alder reaction to afford bicyclo 2.2.1. heptene as a mixture of diasteroisomers whose substituent on C. 7 is in position anti with respect to the Carbon atom bearing the chloro acid chloride functionality, c reaction of the acid chloride with azide ion to afford the corresponding acylazide, d Schimdt s reaction on the acylazide to give the corresponding isocyanate, e treatment of the thus obtained compound with acetic acid to give the corresponding norbornanone, f oxydation sof norbornanone with peracids according to Baeyer Villiger, g treatment of the thus obtained lactone to give the corresponding hydroxy acid, h resolution of the racemic hydroxyacid with optically active bases such as amphetamin or L arginine, i treatment of the hydroxyacid having the desired optical configuration with iodine to give an intermediate species which undergoes an intramolecular nucleophilic attack to afford, after deprotonation, the lactone of Formula EMI3.1 I debenzylation of the ether group of the thus obtained compound with hydrogen in the presence of catalysts to afford the corresponding alcohol of Formula I. The overall yield of this process R.F. Newton and S. M.Roberts Prostaglandins and Thromboxanes, Butterworth and Co. Ltd., London 1982, pagg. 37 41 is about 30 . It is self evident that this synthesis can not be easily carried out on large scale because of the use of reactants which are particularly expensive and difficult to handle. It has been now found that some intermediates particularly useful in the synthesis of prostaglandins can be prepared by using starting materials and reactants which are cheap, easy to handle and suitable to be used on large scale. Furthermore, the process according to this invention offers the advantage to be stereospecific. Still another advantage of this invention is the preparation of a variously substituted cyclopentadiene derivative, through the cyclization of highly substituted aliphatic chains which are cheap and easy to handle. The synthesis schema according to this invention is the following CH3COCH2COOR1 R9HC CH CH2 CHX COOR8EMI4.1 EMI5.1 EMI6.1 where R8 is 1 4 C alkyl, X is halogen, and R1, R5, R6, R7 and R9 have the above mentioned meanings. Compound III is also new, it is therefor a further object of this invention. The preparation of compound III from an alkyl acetoacetate and an alkyl 2 bromo 4 alkanoate is carried out according to known techniques. Compound III is thus prepared as a mixture of dteroisomers. Compound III is then transformed into a Compound Ia through treatment with a suitable condensing agent such as, for example,LDA lithium diisopropyl amide . This cyclization can be carried out in such a conditions that the side chain takes the trans configuration. The conversion of the diketal into the monoketal Ic is one of the most characteristic step of this process in fact, it has been found that the hydrolysis proceeds with yields almost quantitative when it is performed with sulfuric acid at room temperature, in the presence of silica gel and of a suitable solvent such as, for example, methylene chloride. The monoketalIc is then selectively transformed into alcohol Id having alpha configuration with K selectride in tetrahydrofuran at a temperature below 50 C, preferably at 780C. Alcohol Id, in turn, is transformed into Compound le by working as disclosed above in relation to the preparation of Compound Ic. The hydroxy group of Compound Ie is then protected with dihydropyrane in mild conditions and in the presence of a suitable solvent and of pyridinium p toluensulphonate. The subsequent stereoselective reduction with a suitable reducing agent, such as sodium borohydride, allows to obtainCompound Ig. The latter is treated with a suitable acylating agent such as, for example, benzoylchloride, to give CompoundIh, which is then oxydated to afford compound Ii this oxydation can be suitably carried out with ozone. The subsequent treatment of Compound Ii with an alcohol in the presence of boron trifluoride etherate affords Compound II whose enantiomers can be separated in accordance with known techniques. The enantiomer having the undesired configuration can be then transformed into the enantiomer having natural configuration through subsequent racemizations and separations. The desired entaniomer of Formula II can be then reduced into the correspnding aldehyde or alcohol, followed by the synthesis, according to known techniques, of the desired prostaglandins. Furthermore Compound Id is particularly useful for preparingProstaglandin D2. The following examples illustrate the invention without limiting it.
