# V belt structure.

## Abstract
A push type metal V belt for use with V grooved pulleys is produced from a single formed and fan folded strip of sheet metal. The folded strip 10 has alternately tight folded and open folded portions 16 and 12 of differing heights when viewed edgewise of the open folded portions. During the forming of the strip, adjacent drive edges are formed such that, when folded, these edges are aligned so as to become drive surfaces of the belt, the drive surfaces comprising the outer edges of a substantially trapezoidal surface. During the forming of the strip, also, a plurality of lateral slots 34, 36 are formed to provide a space for housing a plurality of metal bands 46 which maintain the fan folded strip in a continuous loop configuration.

## Description
V BELT STRUCTURE This invention relates to a push type metalV belt as specified in the preamble. of claim 1, for example as.disclosed in GB A 655 173. prior art V belts of the folded variety use either a single constant thickness folded strip alone, or a constant thickness folded strip with individual separator blocks disposed between the. outer folds of the strip. The constant thickness folded strip has a large scrub distance between retaining bands thereof and the geometric pitch, which results in large friction losses when the pulley ratio is other than 1 1 The combination of a folded strip and separator blocks, while providing a more efficient drive belt, requires handling and assembly of the individual separator blocks, thus increasing the cost and manufacturing complexity of the drive belt. The present invention is concerned with improving the drive efficiency of a push type metalV belt by reducing the scrub distance between retaining bands thereof and the geometric pitch of the drive portions. To this end a push type metal V belt in accordance with the present invention is characterised by the features specified in the characterising portion of claim 1. A V belt of this construction is potentially less expensive to manufacture than the type of belt utilising individual blocks. In a specific embodiment of a push type metalV belt in accordance with the present invention, a single fan folded metal strip has alternating long and short folded legs with open folds at the inner edge of the long legs and tight folds at the inner edge of the short legs. Each short leg is sized so that the inner fold thereof will be located approximately at the pitch diameter of a pulley having the belt supported thereon.Continuous retaining bands are disposed in transverse lateral slots adjacent the inner fold of the short leg in close proximity to the pitch diameter, thus reducing the scrub distance of the belt and pulley assembly. In the drawing Figure 1 is a top view of a preferred embodiment of a formed metal strip for the production of a push type metal V belt in accordance with the present invention Figure 2 is a view along the line 2 2 ofFigure 1, in the direction of the arrows Figure 3 is an end view of a portion of the metal strip shown in Figures 1 and 2, when folded Figure 4 is a view along the line 4 4 ofFigure 3, in the direction of the arrows and Figure 5 is an end view of the V belt shown in Figures 1 to 4, when disposed on a drive pulley. With reference now to the drawing, wherein like characters represent the same or corresponding parts throughout the several views, there is seen inFigures 1 and 2 a single metal strip generally designated 10. As viewed from left to right the strip 10 has, successively, a drive portion 12, a band retaining portion 14r a drive portion 16 and a band retaining portion 18, this configuration being repeated along the length of the metal strip until the desired number of elements is reached. The drive portion 12 has drive edges 20 and 22 on opposite sides of a fold line 24. As is seen in Figure 3, the folded configuration has an open radius at the fold line 24 such that the adjacent lateral faces 26 and 28 of.the drive portion 12 are separated. The band retaining portion 14 has a central bar 30 which has a fold line 32. A band slot 34 is formed between the drive portion 12 and the central bar 30, and a band slot 36 is formed between the central bar 30 and the drive portion 16.As is seen in Figure 4, the band slots 34 and 36 are aligned when the strip is folded along the fold line 32. The drive portion 16 has drive edges 38 and 40 formed on opposite sides of a fold.line 42 The drive portion 16, when folded, forms a short leg between adjacent drive portions 12. Each drive portion 16 has a tight inner fold at the fold line. A2., and a tight outer fold at the fold line 32 of the band retaining portion 14 and also at a fold line 44 of the band retaining portion 18. The band retaining portion 18 is identical in configuration to the band retaining portion 14 it has a central bar 30 with lateral band slots 34 and 36 formed on either side thereof. The strip 10, when folded to the configuration shown in Figures 3 and 4, is formed into a continuous loop or belt by the use of a plurality of metal bands 46, a portion of such bands 46 being shown in Figure 5. The belt shown in Figure 5 operates withV grooved pulleys. The geometric pitch of the drive belt is disposed at the fold line 42, which is coincident with the pitch diameter 48 of the pulleys.As is seen in Figure 5, the metal bands 46 are in close proximity to the tight inner folds of drive portion 16. With this configuration, there will be minimum relative motion between the metal bands 46 and the formed strip when the belt is operating in a pulley drive system with a drive ratio other than 1 1. As is well known, in a 1 1 drive ratio there is no relative speed differential. The short folded legs permit the folded strip to remain in contact with the pulley with minimal flexing of the outer edges of the metal band, and also retain the tapered inner portions of the drive portions 12 in the configuration shown, with minimal relative movement. This V belt structure provides very low friction losses, and thus establishes a high drive efficiency within the drive belt configuration. Since the V belt is made from a single formed metal strip, the handling of individual belt components is eliminated.
