# METHOD OF PREPARING D BETA HYDROXYISOBUTYRIC ACID BY FERMENTATION

## Abstract
A method is provided for preparing D Î² hydroxyisobutyric acid by fermentation employing isobuty ryl chloride or the methyl and or ethyl esters of isobutyric acid or the methyl and or ethyl esters of methacrylic acid and or the acetate and or formate esters of isobutyl alcohol and or isobutyl isobutyrate or isobutyl methacrylate as the substrate and a microorganism of the genus Candida and other fungi. In an alternative method, the isolated cells of the various microorganisms are employed with one or mixtures of the above substrates.
