# Magnetic fuel ion modifier.

## Abstract
Elongate magnets 24, 25, 26 are arranged about a copper fuel duct 14 with each magnet having a like pole adjacent a flattened or faceted portion 21, 22, 23 of the duct. Each magnet has a flat pole face and bevelled end edges 48, 49 with bevelled end edges being in contact with the similar end edge of each adjacent magnet to define a tunnel through which the fuel duct runs. The duct is con tinuous through the magnet tunnel and terminates at each of its end outside the tunnel in a peripheral bead 15 or other attaching arrangement for coupling of the duct be tween a fuel source, such as fuel pump, and a fuel consum ing apparatus, such as a carburetor. The ducted fuel is thus exposed to flux lines of the magnets that are arranged about the fuel line to concentrate the lines of force at the fuel duct. The magnets and the fuel duct are held together by a sur rounding capsule 12 of non magnetic material such as polypropylene plastic.
