# Knocking treatment to cathode ray tubes.

## Abstract
In a method of manufacturing a cathode ray tube 1 , a dc voltage 7 and an ac voltage 8 are superimposed and applied to a cathode ray tube 1 between a high voltage electrode connected to an anode button 2 and a low voltage electrode connected to a terminal 4 , with the high voltage electrode being at the high potential side of the dc voltage so as to perform knocking treatment. The superimposed dc and ac voltages may be alternately applied in various manners so as to provide improved knocking of the tube.
