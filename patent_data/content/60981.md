# Needle assembly with vein entry indicator.

## Abstract
A needle assembly 10 preferably suitable for single sample blood collection and for determining vein entry when collecting a blood sample from a patient into a vacuum collection device. This assembly includes a housing 12 with an interior chamber 40 having a blood inlet needle 14 on one side of the housing 12 and a blood outlet needle 15 on the other. The outlet needle 15 extends interiorly into the chamber 40 , is open at its distal end and includes a side hole 48 therethrough. A vent plug 26 covers the side hole 48 by surrounding the outlet needle 15 inside the chamber 40 , while a sealant plug 27 covers the open end 45 of the outlet needle 15 . This arrangement prevents liquid from flowing into the holes 45, 48 while allowing gas to flow through the vent plug 26 into the side hole 48 for escape from the assembly 10 whereby the prevented liquid may then be viewed by a user through a transparent portion 42 of the housing 12 . The sealant plug 27 is removable under the influence of a negative pressure gradient applied through the outlet needle 15 so that this sealant plug 27 is withdrawn into the outlet needle 15 and then liquid is allowed to flow into the outlet needle 15 for collection.
