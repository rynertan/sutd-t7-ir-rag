# Semiconductor device and method for manufacturing the same.

## Abstract
A semiconductor device such as a MOS transistor includes floating and control gates 43, 44 . Between the gates is provided a composite insulating layer 25a includ ing a silicon nitride layer 39 . The end portions of the composite insulating layer extend in the channel length direction of the MOS transistor beyond the end portions of at least one of the floating and control gates.
