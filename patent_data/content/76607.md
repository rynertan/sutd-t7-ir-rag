# Treating textile fibres.

## Abstract
The removal of oily soil from textile fibres which have been treated with organosiloxanes, e.g. for improved handle or crease recovery, is facilitated if the fibres are also treated with an organosiloane of the general formula Y₃SiRN R ₂R X in which Y is hydrocarbon, alkoxy or alkoxyalkoxy, at least one Y being alkoxy or alkoxyalkoxy, R represents a divalent hydrocarbon or hydrocarbonoxy group, R represents a monovalent hydrocarbon group or an alkyleneoxy or polyal kyleneoxy group, each R represents methyl or ethyl and X represents a halogen atom.
