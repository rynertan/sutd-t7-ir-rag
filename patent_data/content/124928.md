# A process for preparing lactose products.

## Abstract
A process for preparing stable anhydrous lactose pro ducts comprising mixed crystals of the alpha form and the beta form of lactose. An unstable anhydrous lactose product is heated, at atmospheric or sub atmospheric pressure, at low water vapour pressure, and while avoiding overheating, to a temperature in the range of from 100 C to 220 C, and the product is kept at that temperature until crystallization of mixed crystals of the alpha form and the beta form of lactose occurs.
