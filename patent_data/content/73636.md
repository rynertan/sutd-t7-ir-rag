## Description
PHOTOGRAPHIC ELEMENTS CONTAINING BALLASTED COUPLERS This invention relates to photographic elements containing ballasted couplers. Images are commonly obtained in the photo graphic art by a coupling reaction between the development product of a silver halide developing agent i.e., oxidized aromatic primary amino developing agent and a color forming compound commonly referred to as a coupler. The dyes produced by coupling are indoaniline, azomethine, indamine or indophenol dyes, depending upon the chemical composition of the coupler and the developing agent. The subtractive process of color formation is ordinarily employed in multicolor photographic elements and the resulting image dyes are usually cyan, magenta and yellow dyes which are formed in or adjacent silver halide layers sensitive to radiation complementary to the radiation absorbed by the image dye i.e, silver halide emulsions sensitive to red, green and blue radiation. Since this is a mature artv the patent and technical literature is replete with references to compounds which can be used as couplers for the for mation of photographic images. Preferred couplers which form cyan dyes upon reaction filth oxidized color developing agents are phenols and naphthols.Representative couplers are described in the following patents and publicatiansq U.S. Patents 2,772,162 2,895,826 3,002 836 3,034,892 2,474,293 2,423,730 2,367s531 3,041,236 and Farbkuppler ein Literaturubersicht,k published inAgfa Mitteilungen, Band II, pp. 156 175 1961 .

Alsuw known are compounds which react with oxidized color developing agent in he same way as couplers but which do not yield a dye. Such com pounds are emploved to modify the photographic image by competing ith dye forming ccupler for oxidized color developing agent or by releasing A photographic reagent, such as a development inhibitor, s a result of the coupling reaction. While many such compounds are not commonly referred to as couplers, it is convenient to consider them as such in view of the similarities in the ways they and couplers react during photographic processing. For the purposes of the present inventions they are considered couplers.Representative couplers are described in such patents and published patent applications as U.S. Patents 3,632 345 i,928,041 3,938,996 3,958,993 3,961,959 4,010,035 4,029,503 4,046,574 4s049S455 4,052,213S 4,063,950 4,075,021 4,121,934 4s157s916 4,171,223 4,186,012 and 4,187,110 U.K. Patent Specifications 1.445,797 1,504,094 1,536, 341 and 2,032,914As German OLS1s 2,448,063 2,552,505, 2,610,546 and 2,617,310 andBelgien Patent 839, 083. When intended for incorporation in photographic elements, couplers are commonly dispersed therein with the aid of a high boiling organic sol vent, referred to as a coupler solvent. Couplers ar rendered nondiffusibie in photographic elements, and compatible with coupler solvents, by including in the coupler molecule a group referred to as a ballast group. This group is located on the coupler in a position other than the coupling position and impart to the coupler sufficient bulk to render the coupler nondiffusible in the element as coated and during processing. it will be appreciated that the size an nature of the ballast group will depend upon the bulk of the unballasted coupler and the presence of other substituents on the coupler. Although numerous couplers are known sun the art, there is a continuing problem to improve, or op timize for particular applications, many properties of the coupler and the resultant dye. It is an object of this invention to provide novel photographic elements that contain couplers that have improved stability, reactivity and compatibility with other components in the photographic element, the dyes derived from such couplers having efficient light absorption and good stability and hue. Such g an b accomplished by a photographic element comprising a support, a photographic silver halide emulsion and a nondiffusible photographic coupler which reacts with oxidized color developing agent to give a compound which may or may not be an image dye, characterized in that the coupler contains attached to a position other than the coupling position a ballast terminated with a hydroxyphenyl sulfonyl group or a hydroxyphenylsulfinyl group. The coupling group of the couplers used in the Photographic elements of the invention can be any coupling group known or used in the art to form a colored or colorless reaction product with cxidized color developing agent. Tho b llast group of the couplers used in the invention can be any ballast, or portion thereof, which is terminated with a bydro xyphenylsulionyl or hydroxyphenylsulfinyl group. Preferred couplers used in the invention have the structural formula EMI4.1 where COUP represents a coupling group p is 1 or 2 q is 1 to t and L ws a direct linkage i. e., a covalent bond or a bivalent linking group. The coupling group represented by COUP can be any coupling group commonly used in photographic elements The remainder of the molecule shown in formula I can be joined to the coupling group at any position, other than the coupling position, where ballast groups commonly are joined. The coupling position of the coupling group can be unsubstituted, or substituted with a coupling off group which can modify the equivalency of the coupler, its react iv ity, its dispersibility or which, upon release from the coupler, interacts with other components of the element. The coupling group can include substituents in other positions. The bivalent linking group represented by L can be any of the groups found in ballast groups, such as alkylene of l to 10 carbon atoms, arylene of 6 to 10 carbon atoms, heterocyclene of 5 to 10 carbon atoms, oxygen, sulfur, amino, amido. sulfonamido, carbamoyl. sulfamoyl, and combinations of such linking groups, e.g., alkarylene, aralkylene, aminoarylene, aminoalkylene. amidoarylene, amidoalkylene, ureido, alkarylamido, amidoarylsulfamoyl, aminoarylamido and aminoarylsulfamoylalkyl. Other preferred couplers used in the inven tLon nave the structural formula EMI6.1 where COUP is as defined Above 1, m and n are each individually 0 or 1 L1 represents bivalent group selected fromEMI6.2 L2 represents a bivalent group selected fromEMI6.3 L3 represents a bivalent group selected fromEMI6.4 Rl and R3 are each individually hydrogen alkyl of 1 to 20 carbon atoms or aryl of 6 to 20 carbon atoms R2 is hydrogen or one or more halogen, alkyl or alkoxy substituents X is O or S o Qis C or SO2 r is O or 1 and s is 0 to 10. Particularly preferred couplers used in the invention have the structural formula EMI7.1 where L4 represents a bivalent group selected fromEMI7.2 and COUP, R1, R2, R3, x, r and s are as defined above. In an especially preferred embodiment, the hydroxy group in structural formulae XI and III is in the para position. In the above structural formulae the alkyl, alkylene, aryl, arylene and heterocyclene groups can be unsubstituted or substituted with one or more groups such as halogen, nitro, amino, carboxyl alkyl alkoxy, aryl, aryloxy, heterocyclyl, carbamoyl, amido, sulfamoyl and sulfonamido. As indicated above, common yellow dye form ing couplers are acylacetanilides such as pivalylacetanilides and benzoylacetanilides. Common magenta dye forming couplers are pyrazolones, pyrazolotriazoles, pyrazolobenzomidazoles and lrdazolones. Com mon cyar dye forming couplers are phenols ard naphth ols, common neural dye forming couplers are resorcinols and m aminophenols.Common non dye forming couplers are acyclic.and cyclic compounds in which the active position corresponding to the coupling position, is adjacent to or in conjugation with a carbonyl group or an imino groups, such as a or gamma substituted ketones or imines, e.g. cyclopentanones, cyclohexanones, indanones, indanoimines, oxyindoles and oxazolinones. These couplers can form the coupling group COUP in the above formulae.Structures of representative coupling groups are shown below In these structures Z represents hydro gen or a coupling off group and the unsatisfied bond or bonds, indicates the preferred position, or posi tons, at which there can be attached the remainder of the molecule shown in the above structures, it being recognized that the coupling group can contain other substituents.

For many of the couplers used in the invention it is convenient to provide the hydroxyphenyl sulfonyl group using a 4, 4 sulfonyldiphenol mono ether e.g. benzyl ether or mono ester e.g. acetyl ester. Conventional reaction techniques can be employed to attach such a compound to the remainder of the ballast group and the thus formed ballast group to the coupling group. Thereaater, the blocking group can be removed by hydrogenation in the case of the ether or alkaline hydrolysis in the case of an ester .When the coupler, or the remainder of the ballast group, has an amino group available for reactions it is convenient to react that amino group with a blocked hydroxybenzenesulfonyl chloride after which the blocking group is removed. The couplers used in the invention can be used in the ways and jor the purposes thst nondiffusibie couplers are used in the photographic art. Typically, the couplers are Incorporated in silver nalide emulsfons and the emulsions coated on a support to torm the photographic elements of the in Invention. Alternatively, the couplers can be incorporated in photographic layers adjacent a silver halide emulaion layer where, during deveiopment, the coupler wil be in retctive association wit develop ment products such as oxidized coor developing agent.Thus, as used hereins the term t ass. ciaXed herewith signifies that the coupler is in the silvex halie emulsion or in an adjacent location where, during procassing, it wil come into eaccive associ tion wich silver nalide development products. The photographic elements o che invention an be single color eiements or multicolor elements.Multicolor eiements contain dye imagt forming units ensitive to each of the three primary ragions of the spectrum. Each unit can be comprisan of a single emulsion layer or of multipie emulsion layers sensitive to a given region of the spectrum. The layers of the photographic element, ineluding the ayers the image forming unizs, can be arranged in varions orders as known in the art.In an alternati re for mat, the emulsions sensitive to each of the three primary regions of the spectrum can be disposed as a single segmented layer, e.g., as by the use of micro vessels as described in ss Patent 88l,53. A typical multicolor photographic element of the invention comprises a support bearing a cyan dye image forming unit comprised of at least one red sensitive silver halide emulsion layer having associeted therewith at least one cyan dye forming coupler, a magenta dye imdge forming unit comprising at least one green sansitive silver halie emulsion layer having associated therewith at least one magenta dyeforming coupler and yellow dye image forming unit comprising at laast one blue sensitive ilver halide emulsion layer having associated threwith at least one yellow dye forming coupler, at least one of the couplers in the element being a coupler as described above. The element can contain additional layers, such as filter layers, intarlayers, overcoat layers, subbing layers, and the like. In the following discussion ot suitable materials for use in the emulsions used in the inven tion, reference will be made to Research Disclosure,December 1978, Item 17643. This publication will b identified hereafter by the term Research D .selosure.t The silver halide emulsions employed in the photographic elements of this invention can be either negative working or positive working. Suitable sions and their preparation are described in Research Disclosure Sections I and II and the publications cited therein.Suitable vehicles for the emulsion layers and other layers of elements of this invention are described in Research Disclosure Section IX and the publications cited therein. In addition to the couplers used in the invention additional couplers as described in Research . Disclosure Section VII paragraphs D, E, F and G and the publications cited therein can be used. These couplere can be incorporated in the elements and emulsions as described in Research Disclosure Section V paragraph C and the publications cited therein. The photographic elements of this invention or individual layers thereof, can contain brighteners see Research Disclosure Section V , antifoggants and stabilizers see Research Disclosure Section VI antistain agents and image dye stabilizer see Re s arch Disclosure Section VII, paragraphs I and J , light absorbing and scattering materials see Re search disclosure Section VIII , hardeners see Research Disclosure Section XI . plasticizers and lub ticants see Research Disclosure Section XIII , antistatic agents see Research Disclosure Section XIII , atting agents see Research Disclosure Section KVI and develome.t modifiers se Re aarch Disclosure Section XXI . The photographic elements of che 4.. vention an be coated on a variety of upports as described in Research Disclosure Section XVII anc the refrences described therein. Photographic elements of the invention can exdosed to ctinie radiation. tvdically in the visible region of the spectrum, to form a latent image as described in Research Disclosure SectionXVIII and then processed to torm a visible dye image as described in Research Disclosure Section XIX.Processing to form a visiale dye image includes the step of contacting the element with a color develop ing agent to reduce developable silver halide and oxidize the color developing agent. Oxidized color developing agent in turn reacts with the coupler to yield a dye. Preferred color developing agents are p phenylene diamines. Especially prefered are 4 amino N,N diethyl aniline hydrochloride, 4 amino3 methyl N,N diethylaniline hydrochloride, 4 amino3 methyl N ethyl N ss methanesulfonamido ethylaniline sulfate hydrate, 4 amino 3 methyl N ethyl N ss hydroxyethylaniline sulfate, 4 amino 3 ss methanesulfonamido ethyl N,N diethyl aniline hydrochloride and 4 amino N ethyl N 2 methoxy ethyl m toluidine di p toluene sulfonic acid. With negative working silver halide this processing step leads to a negative image. To obtain a positive or reversal3 image, this step can be preceded by developing exposed silver halide with a non chromogenic developing agent without forming a dye, and then uniformly fogging the element to render unexposed silver halide developable. Alternatively a direct positive emulsion can be employed to obtain a positive image. Development is followed by the conventional steps of bleaching and fixing, or bleach fixing, to remove silver and silver halide, washing and drying.

Examples 1 14 Photographic elements of this invention and control elements were prepared and tested according to the procedures described below. All photographic elements were prepared by coating a cellulose acetate butyrate film support with a photosensitive layer containing a silver bromo iodide emulsion at 0.91 g Ag when the coupler is 4 equivalent or 0.46 g Ag rn2 when the coupler is 2 equivalent ., gelatin at 3.78 g m2, and one of the couplers identified in Table I dispersed in one half its weight of the coupler solvent described and coated at 1.62 x 10 moles m2. The photosensitive layer was overcoated with a layer containing gelatin at 1.08 g m2 and bis vinyl sulfonylmethyl ether at 1.75 weight percent based on total gelatin. Samples of each element were imagewise exposed through a graduated density test object and processes at 400C employing one of three color deveLw oping solutions identified below then stopper, bleached, taxed and washed. In each element, well derined, magenta dye images were produced which were evaluated by ploctiso dye density vs. log exposure sensitometric curves a d recording the maximum dye density DmaX and gamma r ., the contrast determined by the slope of the straight line portion of the curve. Additiona ly, dye hues were evaluated from spectrophotcmetric curves by measuring the maximum absorption peak A max normalized to a density of 1.0 and the half band width HBW .Halfband width is the widths in nanometers, of the spectrophotometric curve at one half the difference between maximum density and stain. Similarly, the top band width TBW and bottom band width BB of the curve were measured at three 4urths and one fourth, respectively, of the normalized density. Curve shape factor CSF equals 100 X TW hBW and provides a ratio of the width near the top and bottom of the absorption curve The greater this ratio, the steeper are the sides of the absorption peak, and the more efficient is the dye S absorption of light in its spectral region. All results are recorded in Table I. These results show that couplers of this invention have enhanced activity, which results in increased maximum dye density and gamma. In addition many of the dyes formed from couplers of this invention have absorption maxima at desirably longer wave lengths and have broader half band widths and larger curve shape factors, resulting in more efficient spectral absorption.

The remaining processing for one element from each pair was stopping, bleaching, fixing and washing while for the second element from each pair the bleaching step was,omitted so that the developed sil ver remained in the element. For those elements in which the silver remained, the amount of developed silver, in g m2, was determined by x ray fluores cence analysis and plotted against exposure.For those elements from which the developed silver had been removed, dye density vs exposure curves were 0enerated. From the plots for pairs of elements developed with the same developer composition there was plotted, for each exposure step, dye density vs developed silver. The slope of the line for the el merits developed in the absence of a competing co ipl Y0 in Table III, below is a measure of the efficiency with which the coupler forms dye the greater the slope the more efficient the coupler.The slope of the line for the elements developed in the presence of the competing coupler Yc in Table III, below is a measure of the reactivity of the couplers the greater the slope, the more reactive the coupler.
