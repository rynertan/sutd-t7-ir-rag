# Improvements in ventilation systems for glove boxes and the like.

## Abstract
A ventilation system for a glove box 1 comprising first 4,5 and second 10,14 extract flow lines connected in parallel between a common outlet 15 from the box and a suction pump 6 . Each extract line includes a vortex amplifier 3,9 and a filter 11,12 . The vortex amplifiers are chosen such that under normal operating conditions the required depression within the box is maintained by flow along the first of the extract lines and a reverse flow from the vortex amplifier in the second extract line passes through the filter in that line and exits through the first extract line without passing into the glove box. The second extract line functions as an emergency extract capability in the event of a breach of the glove box and the reverse flow keeps the filter in the line in a clean and usable condition.
