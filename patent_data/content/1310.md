## Description
Low Phosphate Detergent Composition for Fabric Washing The present invention relates to detergent ccmpositiors and in particular to built detergent compositions adapted for fabric washing. Compositions comprising a detergent and a builder compound are generally referred to in the art as built detergent compositions. When a large portion of the detergency builder is used in relation to the detergent, the compositions are characterized as heavy duty compositions intended primarily for laundering heavily soiled fabrics. Detergent compositions containing lower proportions of builder are light duty compo sitions intended for lightly soiled fabrics, fine fabrics and woollens. The use of detergency builders as adjuncts with organic water soluble synthetic detergents and the property which said materials have for improving the over all detergency performa of such detergents are well known. A variety of such material, especially the sodium polyphosphates, are well known for this detergency builder use. However, some concern has been expressed that certain algae in bodies of water resort to phosphorus containing materials for nutritional value.Phosphorus free builder compounds would be free of such criti cism. Therefore, a need has been created for detergency build which are biodegradable but which are comparable to sodium tripolyphosphates in builder effectiveness. The mechanism whereby detergency builders function to improve the detergency action of water soluble organic detergent compounds is not precisely known, but appears to be some combination of such factors as water softening action. soil suspension and anti redeposition effects and pH adjustment. However, present theory does not allow the prediction of which compounds will serve as effective detergency buildersAccordingly, it has been empirically discovered that a variety of materials, including the aforementioned tripolyphosphates, as well as phosphonates, nitrilotriacetates, sodium sulphate and various silicates and aluminosilicates, all serve as detergency builders, at least to some extent. A variety of polycarboxylates have been previously disclosed to be useful as detergency builders, water softeners and curd dispersants in detergent compositions. For example,U.S. Patent 2,264,103, relates to the use of various polycarboxylic acids as detergency builders and water softeners.This patent teaches that polycarboxylates having three or more carboxyl3groups per molecule are useful as detergency builders and water softeners. Netherlands Application 6,501,871, relates to the use of various polymers, such as those of itaconic and aconitic acids, in laundry detergents.British Patent 1,261,829 discloses the use of oxydisuccinic acid as a detergency builder while British Patent 1,379,241 discloses the use of carboxymethyloxy succinic acid as a detergency builder. It may therefore be seen that a variety of poly carboxylates have been heretofore suggested for use as detergency builders. However, these materials suffer from a variety of defects and have not found general acceptance for this use.For example, many such materials are difficult and expensive to prepare or have to be used in substantial quantities in order to secure effective building capacity. hen, on the other hand, the content of polycarboxylate builder is reduced to an economically viable level, the resulting compositions are frequently found to be defective in some aspect of builder performance such as calcium sequestration or pH buffering in other words they behave as typical under built compositions. Another consideration in the use of polycarboxylates as builders is that certain of the most common and cheapest materials have their greatest buffering effectiveness at relatively low pH levels where conventional bleaching agents such as perborates and percarbonates.are themselves least effective. To a certain extent, therefore, these polycarboxylates and bleaching agents are mutually incompatible and the resulting compositions are consequently found to be deficient in the area of bleachable stain removal performance. A further aspect of bleach polycarboxylate incompatability is that hydroxycarboxylates such as citric acid are known to decompose at higher wash temperatures and can therefore only be used effectively in relatively low temp , erature washing processes. Perborate and percarbonate, on the other hand, are ineffective at low temperatures in the absence of bleach activators. Once again, thereore. building or bleaching performance must, to a certain extent, be compromised when using hydroxycarboxylates as builders The present invention therefore provides low or zero phosphate containing detergent compositions having subs can tially equivalent cleaning performance to a conventional tripolyphosphate built composition. The invention also provides compositions having effective detergency and building performance based on lower than conventional levels of certain polycarboxylate builders. The invention further provides polycarboxylate built detergent compositions having improved cleaning performance in the area of bleachable stain detergency. According to the present invention, there is provided a detergent composition having a phosphorus content of no more than 6 , preferably no more than 5, and a pH in 15 aqueous solution of less than 10, which comprises a from 2 to 755 of an organic detergent selected fro anionic, nonionic, amphoteric and zwitterionic detergents and mixtures thereof, b from 4 to 50 of a carboxylate or polycarboxylate having a first carboxyl logarithmic acidity constant pK1 of less than 9, and c from 0.01 to 45 of a polyphosphonic acid or salt thereof. Preferably, the detergent compositions of the invention have a pH in 18 aqueous solution of less than about 9.5, and more preferably have a pH in the range from about 6 to about 9.0, especially from about 7 to about 8.5. In referred embodiments, the carboxylate or polycarboxylate builder has a logarithmic acidity constant in the range from about 2 to about 8.5, especially from about 4 to about 7.5, and has a logarithmic calcium stability constant pKca in the range from about 2 to about 7.

Other suitable polyphosphonates are those derived from triethy lene tetramine, tetraethylene pentamine, pentaethylene hexamine, and polyethyleneimines such as Montrex 600, a trade mark of Dow Chemical Co., for a polyethyleneimine of molecular weight about 600. The polyphosphonate is preferably added to the compositions of the invention at a level of at least 0.1 and generally at a level in the range from about Q.2 to about 3.5 wt. , more preferably from about 0.5 to about 2.2 wt. of the composition.Optional Components It is to be understood that the compositions of the invention may be supplemented by all manner of detergent components, either by including such components in the aqueous slurry for spray drying or by admixing such components with the compositions of the invention following the drying step. Soil suspending agents at about 0.1t to 10 by weight such as water soluble salts of carboxymethylcellulose, carboxy hydrox1ymethylcellulose, and polyethylene glycols having a molecular weight of about 400 to 10,000 are common components of the present invention.Compositions containing monomeric polycarboxylates as the builder component can also be supplemented b from about 0.18 to about 48 of the above defined polymeric polycarboxylates as soil suspending agents1 e.g.Gantrez ANll9. Dyes, pigment optical brighteners, and perfumes can be added in varying amounts as desired. Suitable bleaches herein include percarbonatgs, perborates, and acti vapors therefore. Other materials such as fluorescers, antiseptics, germicides, enzymes in minor amounts, anti caking agents such as sodium sulfosuccinate, and sodium benzoate may also be added.Enzymes suitable for use herein include those discussed inU.S. Patents 3,519,570 and 3,553,139 to McCarty and cCarty et al issued 7 July, 1970 and 5 January, 1971 respectively. Additional inorganic alkaline detergency builder salts can also be added, although high levels of highly alkaline builder salts and of phosphorus contaiong bvilder salts should be avoided. In particular, the solution pH of the composition should be less than about 10, more preferably in the range from about 6 to about 9.5. The solution pH isdefined ds the pH of a 18 solution in distilled water of the detergent composition. Inorganic builder salts include, for instance, alkali metal carbonates, tetraborates, pentaborates, aluminates, bicarbonates, sesquicarbonates, and water insoluble zeolites or alumino silicates. One such alumino silicate which is useful in the compositions of the invention is an amorphous water insoluble hydrated compound of the formula Na xAlO2 ySi02 , wherein x is gn integer 9f from 1 to 1.2 and y is 1, said amorphous material being further characterized by a g exchange capacity of from about 50 mg eq. CaC03 g to about 150 mg eq. CaCO3 g. This ion exchange builder is more fully described in Ireland published patent application 1505 74, to B.H. Gedge et al filed 16 July, 1974, herein incorporated by reference. A second water insoluble synthetic aluminosilicate ion exchange material useful herein has the formula Naz A102 z. SiO2 y xH20, wherein z and y are integers of at least 6 the molar ratio of z to y is in the range from 1.0 to about 0.5, and x is an integer from about 15 to about 264 said aluminosilicate ion exchange material having a particle size diameter from about 0.1 micron to about 100 microns a calcium ion exchange capacity of at least about 200 mg eq. g and a calcium ion exchange rate of at least about 2 grains gallon minute gram as described in Belgian Patent 814,874 herein incorporated by reference. Inorganic phosphate builders can also be included in the present compositions, although they should only be added in minor amounts such that the total phosphorus content is less than 65 and preferably less than 3 by weight of the composition. The polyphosphates can be selected from both chain polyphosphates such as tripolyphosphates, tetrapolyphosphate and pentapolyphosphate, and metaphosphates such as tetrametaphosphate, pentametaphosphate and hexametaphosphate. Higher polyphosphates having the empirical formulae Na16P14043 and Nal2Pl003l can also be used. Mixtures of chain polyphos phates and metaphosphate can also be used. Preferred polyphosphates are the chain polyphosphates having from 3 to 9 preferably from 4 to 6 phosphorus atoms molecule. A particularly suitable material is PhosphateGlass 627 believed to be a sodium pentaphosphate marketed by Albright and Wilson which is added in levels up to 10 , especially up to 45 by weight of the composition giving benefits particularly in particulate clay removal performance. Organic carhoxylates or polycarboxylates having pK1 greater than 9 can also be added, eg., nitrilotriacetates or olefin maleic acid copolymers. Such additional builders are preferably only present in small amounts, however, eg., up to about 88 by weight of the composition. A further optional component of the present compositions is a suds depressant., Soap is an effective suds depressant, especially C16 22 soaps, for instance those derived by neutralisation of Hyfac trade name fatty acids. These are hardened marine fatty acids of chain length predominantly C18 to C20.However, non soap suds depressants are preferred. A preferred suds depressant comprises silicones. In particular, there may be employed a particulate suds depressant comprising silicone and silica releasably enclosed in a water soluble or water dispersable substantially non surface active detergent impermeable carrier. Suds depressing agents of this type are disclosed in r,tish Patent Specification 1,407,997 incorporated herein by reference. A very suitable granular prilled suds depressant product comprises 78 silica silicone 85 by weight sila nated silica, 15t silicone obtained from Messrs. DowCorning , 65 sodium tripolyphosphate, 25 tallow alcohol ,25 ie. condensed with 25 molar proportions of ethylene oxide , and 3 moisture. Also suitable and preferred a a combination of 0.02 to 5 by weight, especially about 0.3 of the composition, of a substantially water insoluble .wax or mixture of waxes, melting at from 350C to 1250C, and having saponification value less than 100, and a suds depressing amount, usually about 25 of the composition, of particulate suds depressant mentioned above. Another desirable component of the compositions of the invention is a water soluble cationic surfactant such as those described in European Patent Application No. 78 20G 050.9. incorporated herein by reference. The cationic surfactant, when used in combination with anionic and nonionic surfactants in defined ratios and amounts, improves the oil stain detergency performance of the formulation. Preferred cationic surfactants have the general formula 1 2 R m 4 m N A wherein R1 is selected from C8 20 alkyl, alkenyl and alkaryl groups R2 is selected from C1 4 alkyl, and benzyl A is an anion and m is 1,2, or 3 provided that when m is 2, R1 has less than 15 carbon atoms, and when m is 3, R1 has less than 9 carbon atoms. C12 and C14 alkyl trimethyl ammonium salts are highly preferred. In preparing granular detergent compositions of the invention the components may be mixed together in any order and in powdery or in fluid form, eg. in an aqueous dispersion.The composition may be sprayed dried, drum dried, freeze dried or dried by other means, to provide a granular compo sition. Usually a moisture content of about 3 to about 10 is suitable to provide non sticky free flowing granules. Liquid detergent compositions of the invention can contain, as optional ingredients, organic carriers or solvents such as lower aliphatic alcohols having from 2 to 6 carbon atoms and 1 to 3 hydroxyl groups ethers of diethylene glycol and lower aliphatic mono alcohols having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms and mixtures thereof. Liquid compositions can also contain hydrotropes such as the water soluble alkylaryl sulfonates having up to 3 carbon atoms in an alkyl group such as sodium, potassium, ammonium and ethanol amine salts of xylene , toluene , ethylbenzeneand isopropylbenzene sulfonic acids.
