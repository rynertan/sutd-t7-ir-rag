# Olefin polymerization catalyst and process.

## Abstract
Isotactic index improvement is achieved for Câ‚ƒ and higher alpha olefins in systems containing a catalyst component comprising titanium supported on a magnesium halide sup port. The titanium component is formed by copulverizing the magnesium halide with one or more eletron donor followed by treatment with liquid titanium halide. The improvement is achieved by using a dialkylaluminum monohalide component with the trialkylaluminum cocatalyst normally used. In non slurry polymerizatins improvements in both activity and isotactic index have been achieved. In slurry polymerizations, the isotactic index of the polymer has been improved. It is possible to achieve a variable melt flow index for polyp ropylene while maintaining good isotactic index. Isotactic index is retained at high levels even though the temperature and or time of polymerization is varied.

## Description
OLEFIN POLYMERIZATION CATALYST AND PROCESSRelated Application The present invention is a continuation in part of U.S. Application Serial No. 516,178, filed July 21, 1983.Background of the Invention The present invention relates to a catalyst for the polymerization of alpha olefins, such as propylene. It is known to polymerize alpha olefins, such as propylene, using a catalyst component comprising titanium on a magnesium halide support, the component being obtained by copulverizing magnesium halide with at least one electron donor to form a copulverized product followed by reacting the copulverized product with a liquid titanium compound containing halogen.Such a component is then used in the polymerization reaction with a trialkylaluminum co catalyst, e.g., triethylaluminum. An example of such a procedure is shown in co pending U. S. Application Serial No.405,977, filed August 9, 1982, which is incorporated herein by reference. The use of halogen containing organoaluminum cocatalyst components, e.g., dialkylaluminum monohalides, such as diethylaluminum chloride, has been suggested for use in addition to the trialkylaluminum cocatalyst in conjunction with certain types of magnesium chloride supported catalysts containing titanium to, in general, increase the activity of the catalyst, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,234,710 to C. W. Moberly et al. That patent, however, indicates that, although the activity increases, the isotactic index of the resulting polymer as indicated by the disclosed xylene solubles content either decreased of stayed approximately the same. Summary of the Present Invention The present invention relates to a novel catalyst combination which comprises a trialkylaluminum dialkylaluminum monohalide combination which unexpectedly gives increased isotactic index to the resulting polypropylene produced using it. This is unexpected since the general teaching in the art is that a dialkylaluminum monohalide was an effective activity promoter but had either little effect, or a deleterious effect, on the isotactic index of the resulting polymer when certain types of titanium containing catalysts were used e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,234,710 , It has also been found that it is possible to achieve a variable melt flow index while having a substantially constant isotactic index of good value.There is good. retention of isotactic index for the system even though the temperature and or time of polymerization is varied.Detailed Description of the Present Invention The catalyst of the present invention comprises a a magnesium chloride supported titanium containing component and b an organoaluminum cocatalyst combination, preferably with an electron donor. Component a in the catalyst is a magnesium chloride containing material which is formed by copulverizing magnesium chloride with one or more electron donors Lewis bases to form a copulverized product which is then contacted with a liquid titanium compound containing halogen. The types of electron donor materials which can be used are organic compounds containing 0, N, S, or P moieties which share electrons. Some representative donor materials which can be used include phenol compounds, aliphatic and aromatic ethers, aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic esters, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids, lactones, polysiloxanes and carboxylic acyl halides. Repres entative donor materials suitable for activating. the magnesium chloride support material are known in the art.Preferably, the donors used include phenol compounds, polysiloxanes and esters of a carboxylic acid e.g., ethyl benzoate as described in U. S. Serial No. 405,977, above . The copulverization step can include TiClq e.g., as a complex with one or more of the donors . The amount of donor material used can range from about 0.05 to 3 times the weight of the magnesium chloride. After the copulverized magnesium chloride donor material has been formed by suitable grinding for a suitable length of time e.g., 0.5 hr. to about 30 days , the product is treated with a liquid titanium halide, such as TiCl4. The liquid titanium compound containing halogen is contacted with the activated magnesium halide at elevated temperature, e.g., 60 C. to about 1200C. . The amount of titanium halide used can be varied quite widely, e.g., about 0.5 to 500 times the weight of the solid being treated. The component b used in the present invention is a mixture of trialkylaluminum and a dialkylaluminum monohalide cocatalyst combination preferably with a suitable electron donor for the mixture e.g., an ester of carboxylic acid . The trialkylaluminum material has been conventionally used alone with the type of magnesium chloride component described before and includes such compounds as triethylaluminum, tri n butylaluminum, triisobutyl aluminum, and trihexylaluminum. The molar amount used preferably ranges from about 200 1 to about 10 1 based on the titanium content of component a . The molar ratio of donor to component a can range from 1 15 to 1 1. A novel addition to component b , in accordance with the present invention, is a dialkylaluminum monohalide, such as diethylaluminum chloride, diethylaluminum bromide, and dibutylaluminum chloride. The total aluminum can be in a molar ratio of from about 10 1 to about 600 1 based on the moles of Ti in component a . The mole ratio of trialkylaluminum to dialkylaluminum monohalide component can range from 5 1 to 1 5, preferably from about 5 1 to about 1 1. When the amount of dialkylaluminum halide is less than the amount of trialkylaluminum compound, both activity and isotactic index improvement in the polymerization of propylene have been noted when bulk polymerization is used. Preferably, the molar ratio of alkyl to halogen in the cocatalyst ranges from about 3 1 to about 30X1, most preferably about 4 1 to 8 1. The types of donors useful with component b can be the conventional donors used with organoaluminum e.g., the alkyl esters of aromatic carboxylic acids, which are preferred . Representative donors include methyl toluate, ethyl anisate and ethyl benzoate. The molar ratio of donor to the organoaluminum portion of component b used can range from about 1 15 to 1 1. The catalyst of the present invention Ti containing component plus tri alkylaluminum dialkyla luminum monohalide has been found to increase the isotactic index of polypropylene when utilized as compared to a similar catalyst system not containing the dialkylaluminum halide. In polymerizations e.g., bulk polymerizations which substantially no hydrocarbon solvent is used to form the slurry for the olefin e.g., propylene , it has also been found that the activity of the present catalyst is higher than one lacking dialkylaluminum monohalide cocatalyst, e.g., when the halogen containing cocatalyst component is present at a lower amount than the amount of trialkylaluminum. The catalyst in slurry polymerizations has been found to result in an increase in the iso tactic index of the polymer as compared to an analogous catalyst lacking the dialkylaluminum monohalide component. In slurry polymerizations it has also been shown that the iso tactic index does not decrease for systems containing an anisate electron donor for the cocatalyst as the temperature is increased. In analogous systems lacking the dialkylaluminum monohalide component with a toluate electron donor, the isotactic index decreased The following Examples are intended to further describe the present invention for purposes of further illustration. EXAMPLE 1 This Example illustrates preparation of the titanium tetrachlorideethyl benzoate complex used in the preparation of a particularly preferred catalyst in accordance with the present invention. The use of this complex is preferred but not required. A 3 liter L three necked flask was equipped with a gas inlet valve, a mechanical stirrer bearing driving a paddle made of TEFLON fluorocarbon polymer, and a 250ml pressure equalizing dropping funnel. To this flask was added 1.5 L heptane Phillips 99.9 and 190 ml 1.73 mol distilled TiCl4 under rapid stirring followed by the slow addition of 245 ml 1.72 mol ethyl benzoate Aldrich 99 during a one hour period. A yellow precipitate ofthe complex formed immediately. The mixture was stirred for two hours at ambient conditions. After transfer of the flask to a Vacuum Atmospheres Co. glove box under nitrogen, the mixture was filtered, washed with two liters heptane, and vacuum dried for about 17 hours. The yield approached theoretical. EXAMPLE 2 This Example illustrates preparation of the copulverized, supported component containing titanium of the present invention. Intoa 6.2 L Paul Abbe jar mill was placed 500 g. MgCl 2 vacuum dried under heat containing about 1 percent water and 8.0 kg of 1.6 cm diameter 5 8 inch stainless steel balls. This charge was milled for five days at about 50 rpm. The activated powder was separated from the milling balls by means of a No. 30 sieve. The 8.0 kg of stainless steel balls, 1.6 cm diameter and 250 g 2.62 mol of activated MgCl2 were recharged into the same mill along with 255 g of phenol 2.71 mol and 37.5 ml 96 100 millipoise silicone oil General Electric Co. SF 96 100 . Milling at about 50 rpm was carried out for another five days. Then 132 of the TiCl4 ethyl benzoate complex of Example 1 was added to the charge and the new mixture milled for yet another five days total 15 days . The orange red product was then sieved thru a No. 3Q screen to separate the product from the milling balls. The yield was 540 g. Inside a glove box under nitroqen, 212 gm. of the milled product was charged into a 2 L, three necked flask equipped with a 250 ml pressure equalizing dropping funnel, gas inlet valve, and mechanical stirrer shaft. With stirring, under nitrogen, 625 ml toluene was transferred into the reaction flask by cannula followed by the addition of 375 ml 3.41 mol TiC14 also by cannula. The reaction mixture was stirred at about 100 rpm as the flask was slowly heated to 900C. by an oil bath. EXAMPLE 2 cont d. After temperature equilibration for about one hour, the reaction was continued at about 900C. for an additional three hours. The reaction flask was then cooled to ambient conditions over 45 minutes during which the solid phase settled, whereupon the supernatant liquid was removed by cannula. Thenl L toluene was added with mild stirring, about 40 rpm, to wash the solid for ten minutes. After a settling time of a half hour, the supernatant liquid was again removed by cannula. The washing was repeated once more with toluene and five times more with heptane all washes 1 L . The washings were followed by transfer of the orange slurry to a 1 L, three neck flask with additional heptane. The supernatant was removed by cannula remaining heptane evaporated under vacuum.After sieving through a No. 140 screen, the yield from this TiClX extraction process was 92 g of orange brown powder catalyst component a .. EXAMPLE 3 This Example illustrates the general procedure for the bulk polymerization of an olefin propylene employing the novel catalyst of this invention. Into a 10 L stirred reactor equipped with a heater, means for temperature control, and gas inlet and outlet lines were added, in order as described on the Table given below triethylaluminum TEAL , diethylaluminum chloride where used DEAC , and either ethyl anisate EA or methyl p toluate MPT , 75 mg of the novel catalyst prepared in Example 2, and 1 psi hydrogen as a polymerization moderator. The reactor was stirred at an agitation rate of 400 rpm. Then 8 L of liquid polypropylene was added and brought to 800C. The standard polymerization test was run for 2 hours. At the end of the polymerization time, excess propylene was vented from the reactor. The polymer was collected, dried at 700C. and weighed to give the amount of dry polymer. The Table which follows sets forth the results obtained for a series of reactions thus run. In theTable the amount of TEAL, DEAC, MPT and EA in the cocatalyst is given in millimoles in all cases.

In order to most clearly see the effect that DEAC has when substituted for a portion of the TEAL normally present, a comparison of Run Nos. 2 and 4 should be made.In No. 4, the activity increased, as compared to No. 2, nearly 41 and, unexpectedly, the II also increased by 4.9 points.
