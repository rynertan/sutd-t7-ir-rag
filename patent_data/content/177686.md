# Process for bonding metals to electrophoretically deposited coatings, and printed circuit with plated through holes produced thereby.

## Abstract
An economical process for producing metal plated through holes in metal core circuit boards is claimed which permits the formation of small holes and fine conductor lines. A metal sheet, which will become the core of a metal core circuit board, is provided with insulation layers on both sides, and through holes are provided through the insula tion layers. The process involves incorporating fillers in a resinous coating solution which is electrophoretically ap plied to the hole walls to form an insulating layer of uniform thickness thereon. An increased diameter in the metal hole portion of each hole acts to restrict flow of the filled resinous solution during cure resulting in a straight hole wall. The coating is adhesion promoted and a metal layer is deposited thereon.
