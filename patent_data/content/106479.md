# Heat exchanger.

## Abstract
A heat exchanger such as an oil cooler consists of flat tubes 12 spaced apart in an array. A connector 19 feeds a header and another header is provided at the other end of the tubes. The tubes are closed at the ends by an end plate 13 which has channel shaped depressions 13 over the region where it contacts the tubes, and arms 13a, 13b. The depressions 13 and arms 13a, 13b hold the oil cooler tubes together after assembly so that the oil cooler can be removed from the jig in which it was assembled and passed through a brazing apparatus without any jigging means.

## Description
HEAT EXCFTGER This invention relates to a heat exchanger. It is particularly concerned with both a form of exchanger and a method of fabricating it.The present invention provides a heat exchanger comprising a stack of tubes maintained in co extensive space array two headers com municating with the tubes and an end plate for each end of the stack which close the tubes and locate the tubes in the spaced array.The location of the tubes by the end plates facilitates transfer of the heat exchanger to a brazing apparatus during manufacture.In a preferred form of the invention the heat exchanger has tubes of flattened section.. The end plate preferably has channel shaped depressions over the region where it engages the tubes, the walls C of the depressions cont4ing the end portions of the outside of the tubes. The tubes fit in the channel shaped depressions, which complement the shape of the tubes, providing closure for the tubes, assistance in location of the tubes, and a good contact area between the ends of the tubes and the end plate which facilitates good sealing of the ends of the tubes during brazing. The end plate is advantageously secured by brazing. Ihe invention also provides a method of fabricating a heat exchanger comprising the steps of assembling the stack and end plates in a jig removing it from the jig, and undertaking a siBgle brazing operation to miite the assembly.The invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawing in Which Figure 1 is a partially exploded view of an oil cooler Figure 2 is a section through an end plate on the oil cooler.Figure 1 shows a spaced array or stack 11 of flat walled tribes typically tube 12. The tubes are both closed at each end and spacedEMI2.1 apart by end plates 13 oflorly one is shown. A section of the end plate 13 is showy in Figure 2 located at the end of stack 11. The end plate 13 is provided with a series of channel shaped dimples 14 each of which correspond in shape to the end of the tube which they serve both to close and to locate in the stacks If the end plate was flats the tubes would only be contacted over their end faces1 which could cause sealing problems.The diannel shaped depressions are in interference fit with the flat end portions of the tubes as well as contacting their end faces and this promotes good liquid tight sealing after brazing has been undertaken, and assists in holding the assembly together during brazing. ide end plate terminates in arms 13c, 13b which engage the top and bottom of the stack.In view of the length of the tubes in the array additional spacers 15 are provided along the length of the stack.To enable liquid to be circulated through the stack 11 a connector 19 engages hole 17 and is brazed in place on assembly to provide an externally liquid tight joint between the connector 19 and tLe top tube. Xhe connector feeds a header defined by apertures in the tubes except of course on the lower face of the lower tube and apertured washers 1 between the tubes. A similar connector not shown connects to an identical header at the other end of the stacks Ihe connectors allow hoses or other couplings to be secured to the oil cooler. Wurbulators in the form of corrugated inserts are provided along the length of each tube1 in order to cause turbulence in the flow along the tubes to improve heat transfer and to provide resistance to crushing of the flat tubes. Ihe washer 17a each have a raised rim at their inner diameter on both sides which fits into the apertures in the tubes, in order to locate the washers prior to brazing. In addition, because the end plates are so shaped that they clamp the ends of the stack together when fitted on, when the parts have been assembled in a jig, the whole assembly stays together and be lifted in one piece from the jig, to be passed through a brazing apparatus.The self jigging nature of the assembled oil cooler is a particular advantage, since the need for a combined assembly and brazing jig is avoided.The parts of the oil cooler are of aluminium, and the endEMI4.1 tb SEP tes tb are of q9i1d aluminium which means that the cladding of lower melting aluminium melts during the brazing operation. The brazing operation may be carried out in an inert gas. The oil cooler is particularly suited because of itsEMI4.2 tb e tb to being waterecooled by insert ion in a header tank of a radiator. Of course, the oil cooler is equally well suited to being air cooled and, to this end, may incorporate corrugated fin material between the spacers 15 and the washers 17 Various modifications may of course be nade without departing from the scope of the invention. Thus, for example, instead of providing washers 17a with a raised internal rim for locating washers, flat washers may be e used and a tubular ine rt may be inserted through the header apertures, the inset having holes registering with each flat tube to allow feed and return of liquid.
