# Process for producing a patterned resist image.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a process for producing a pat terned resist image in a layer of a phenol formaldehyde diazoketone resist material. The exposed patterns in the resist layer are developed in an oxygen plasma by treating the resist layers, prior to development, with a magnesium salt. This produces a nega tive pattern. Positive patterns are produced by combining the process with decarboxylation of the exposed areas followed by blanket exposure.
