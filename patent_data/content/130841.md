# Valve stem packing assembly.

## Abstract
A valve body B has a stem passage rotatably receiving a valve stem C . A packing 52 surrounds the stem in the pas sage and a packing nut 100 threaded on the stem applies axial force to radially expand the packing into sealing engagement with the stem and passage wall. The packing comprises co operating first and second packing members 60, 62 engaging at angularly disposed slippage surfaces for translation of com pressive axial forces into radial expansion and sealing engage ment with the stem and with the passage wall. A packing sup port ring 50 engages the end face of the packing adjacent the packing nut. A gland 58 engages the support ring 50 and a pair of reversely positioned spring washers 90a, 90b are interposed between the gland and the packing nut. A handle 102 is attached to the stem by a handle nut 106 , and a spring washer 90c interposed between the handle and the handle nut prevents loosening of the handle nut.
