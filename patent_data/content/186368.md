## Abstract
The present invention provides vaccines containing inactivated avian infectious bronchitis virus VLO 10110 AVI 9 and or an inactivated virus strain serologically related there to the immune response to which in birds is enhanced by priming with a live heterologous strain of avian infectious bronchitis virus. Immunisation of poultry against infectious bronchitis using such a vaccine does not require initial vaccination or priming of the poultry with a live vaccine of the same strain, thus enabling priming to be effected using a well tried conventional live heterologous vaccine, for example a live vaccine to an avian infectious bronchitis virus of the Massachusetts serotype.

## Description
BIOLOGICAL PREPARATIONS This invention relates to novel vaccines and a novel method for immunizing poultry against infectious bronchitis. Infectious bronchitis is a highly contagious r pin8toty disease of chickens which, in the case of laying hens, may also adversely affect egg production and quality. The use of infectious bronchitis vaccines for immunisation of poultry has now been established for many years. In general, the vaccines contain an infectious bronchitis virus of a particular serotype such as Connecticut or Massachusetts serotypes, the latter being more common in Great Britain and Europe.Combination of different infectious bronchitis serotypes has also been tried, but protection against the respective serotypes ia not always optimal. More recently, inactivated infectious bronchitis vaccines containing variant, i.e. new serologically distinct, strains of infectious bronchitis virus have been introduced but they require poultry to be initially immunised or primed with a live vaccine hitherto it has been believed that such priming had to be effected using a live vaccine comprising a virus of the same strain as the inactivated virus. We have now found that insctivated vaccines derived from a novel variant strain of avian infectious bronchitis virus and strains serologically related thereto i.e. viruses which cross react with this particular variant strain offer protection against such, serologically related variant strains and furthermore, iumunisation with such vaccines surprisingly does not require initial vaccination or priming of the poultry with a live vaccine of the same strain.This enables priming to be effected using heterologous live vaccines which may be well tried, conventional live vaccines of established safety and effectiveness. The novel avian infectious bronchitis variant virus strain was isolated from broiler chickens and has been deposited at the CentralVeterinary Laboratory, New Haw at Weybridqe, United Kingdom registered under the number VLn 10110 AVI 9 and also at the Institut Pasteur, Paris, France registered under the number I 4XOTdeposited on 11thDecember 1984. This strain, hereinafter referred to as VLO 10110 AVI 9, was shown in virus,neutralistion tests to be related but not identical to the Dutch D207 strain but is distinct from the conventional viruses of the Massachusetts serotype commonly used in infectious bronchitis vaccines. by means of cross neutralisation tests carried out in tracheal organ 6vultures, it was found that the isolate is not neutralised by antiserum to infectious bronchitis virus M4l or to theH120 vaccine strains of infectious bronchitis virus both of which are of the Massachusetts serotype. Table l summarises the results of the various virus neutralisation VN tests using the constant virus variable serum method.The results indicate that the new variant virus VLO 10110 AVI 9 is distinct serologically and does not belong to the Massachusetts serotype. The oil emulsion vaccines referred to inTable 1 contain the Massachusetts M4l strain and or the VLO 10110 AVI 9 variant strain of avian infectious bronchitis virus.

As indicated above, we have found that an inactivated vaccine based on the novel variant strain VLO 10110 AVI 9 of infectious bronchitis virus and or a strain serologically related thereto do not require poultry to have been initially vaccinated or primed with a live vaccine of the same strain. Instead, and unexpectedly we have found that priming with a heterologous live vaccine based on a conventional strain example H120 vaccine is sufficient to ensure that subsequent vaccination with the vaccine based on the inactivated variant strain gives a boosted immune response.Thus we have found that priming with a live attenuated virus vaccine of theMassachusetts serotype such as a live vaccine to any conventional strain of the Massachusetts serotype H120, H52 or M41, or mildMassachusetts MM is sufficient to ensure that subsequent vaccination with the inactivated variant strain vaccine to VLO 10110 AVI 9 and or serologically related strains gives a boosted immune response. The inactivated vaccines to the variant strain VLO 10110 AVI 9 and or strains serologically related thereto may be prepared by conventional means, for example by growing the virus in embryonated eggs. The infectious allantoic fluid having reached a suitable titre e.g. approximately 108.0 median ciliostatic doses ml 8.0 log10 CD5Jml wherein CD5gml is as defined in J.K.A. Cook et. al., Archives of Virology 1976, 50, 109 118 may then be harvested and inactivated using inactivating agents such as formaldehyde or ss propiolactone. After inactivation the virus may be concentrated and the pH may be adjusted if necessary. The inactivated antigen in an aqueous medium may be mixed with an adjuvant such as aluminium hydroxide or incorporated into an oil emulsion comprising an oil, e.g. paraffin oil, an oil soluble surfactant, and a water soluble surfactant, the ratio of oil to aqueous phase generally being in the range 2 5 1. Purified paraffin oils which may be used in an adjuvant emulsion include, for example, proprietary products such as Drakeol, Marcol orPuremore, though most grades of liquid paraffin are suitable. An oil such as squalane may also be employed. The most preferred ratio of oil to aqueous phase is about 4 1, the resulting emulsion being stable and of n suitable viscosity for injection. The oil soluble surfactant is preferably a monoester of a sugar alcohol anhydride, for example sorbitan or mannitan, with a long chain fatty acid such as oleic, stearic or lauric acid. Arlacel 80 or Span 80 sorbitan mono oleate and Arlacel A mannitan mono oleate are particularly suitable. The water soluble surfactant is preferably a polyoxyethylene derivative of a monoester of a sugar alcohol anhydride, such as sorbitan with a long chain fatty acid such as lauric, oleic or stearic acid. The polyoxyethylene chain preferably contains about 20 oxyethylene units. Tween 80 polyoxyethylene 20 sorbitan mono oleate is particularly suitable. The concentration of the oil soluble surfactant in the oil phase is preferably in the range 8 12Z w v , advantageously about 10 w v . The concentration of the water soluble surfactant in the water phase is preferably in the range of 4 to 4.5 w v , advantageously about 4.25Z w v . The vaccine may advantageously contain inactivated virus obtained from 106 to 108 median ciliostatic doses 6 to 8 log10 CDso of the variant strain VLO 10110 AVI 9 and or a serologically related strain per dose of vaccine. The inactivated vaccines will usually be given to the birds at the point of lay at an age of approximately 16 20 weeks by subcutaneous or intramuscular injection, preferably by the intramuscular route. One dose of the inactivated vaccine is usually sufficient and may, for example, consist of 0.25 to 1.90 ml, e.g. 0.5 ml, of the above vaccine, such a dose advantageously containing the antigenic equivalent of 106 to 108 median cilostatic doses 6 to 8.0 log10 CDso of the variant virus strain. The inactivated vaccines may contain, in addition to the inactivated variant strain VLO 10110 AVI 9 and or a strain serologically related thereto, one or more additional inactivated virus strains such as those of the Massachusetts serotype for exampleM41, other strains of infectious bronchitis virus or other viruses such as Newcastle disease virus, infectious bursal disease virus, adeno viruses such as EDS 76 virus, reoviruses, and other viruses.Thus, for example, such vaccines include a monovalent oil emulsion vaccine containing inactivated VLO 10110 AVI 9 alone, a bivalent oil emulsion vaccine containing both inactivated VL√ª 10110 AVI 9 and inactivated Massachusetts M41, a trivalent oil emulsion vaccine containing VLO 10110 AVI 9, inactivated Massachusetts M41 andNewcastle disease virus or a tetravalent oil emulsion vaccine containing 40 101 i0 AVI 9, inactivated Massachusetts M41, Newcastle disease virus and infectious bursal disease virus. As indicated above, the recipients of the inactivated vaccines of the invention may be primed using a conventional live infectious bronchitis virus vaccine, for example live attenuated virus vaccine containing an avian infectious bronchitis virus of the Massachusetts serotype such as a live vaccine to a conventional H120, H52, M41 or MN virus. This is, sufficient to ensure that subsequent vaccination with an emulsion variant strain vaccine gives a boosted immune response. Infectious bronchitis virus H120 vaccine is preferred as the priming vaccine and particularly preferred is that provided by GlaxoAnimal Health Limited as a freeze dried 1,000 dose vial which can be reconstituted in lml water and then diluted further as required. The Priming vaccine is given to chickens at up to 12 weeks of age, preferably 3 weeks of age. In addition an optional second priming dose or further doses may be given. The vaccine may contain at least 3 1og10,median egg infectious doses E1D50 of live attenuated avian infectious bronchitis virus per bird dose. The vaccine may be administered in the drinking water, by eye drop, intranasally or, by aerosol sprey. In general, the inactivated vaccine should be given at least 4 weeks, more preferably about 13 weeks, after the priming vaccine. According to a further feature of the invention, we provide a method of immunizing 8 bird against avian infectious bronchitis whereby the bird is vaccinated with an inactivated vaccine containing inactivated avian infectious bronchitis virus VLO 10110 AVI 9 and or a strain serologically related thereto, the bird having previously been vaccinated with a live vaccine containing a live heterologous avian infectious bronchitis virus i.e. a strain serologically different from that of the said inactivated virus . According to a still further feature of the invention, we provide a kit comprising separately said inactivated virus and said live virus vaccines. The kit comprises multiple dosage units of each of the respective vaccines. Preferably, 500 or 1000 dosage units of each vaccine may be present in the kit. According to a still further feature of the invention we provide the use of an inactivated vaccine containing inactivated avian infectious bronchitis virus VLO 10110 AVI 9 and or a strain serologically related thereto, to vaccinate birds against avian infectious bronchitis in combination with an initial vaccination with a live vaccine containing a live heterologous avian infectious bronchitis virus. According to yet another feature of the invention, we provide the use of inactivated avian infectious bronchitis virus VLO 10110 AVI 9 and or a strain serologically related thereto, to prepare a vaccine for use in vaccinating birds against avian infectious bronchitis in combination with an initial vaccination with a live vaccine containing a live heterologous avian infectious bronchitis virus.The following examples illustrate the invention.Example 1 a Preparation of monovalent oil emulsion vaccine containing inactivated strain VLO 10110 AVI 9Ten day old SPF embryonated chicken eggs were inoculated via the allantoic cavity with 3 4 log10 CD50 of infectious bronchitis virus strain VLO 10110 AVI 9. After 70 hours incubation at 370C, the allantoic fluid was harvested. A preservative was added 0.013Z thiomersal and after clarification by low speed centrifugation, virus infectivity was inactivated by incubation with 0.05 ss propiolactone for 2 hours at 37 degrees C. The inactivated allantoic fluid was concentrated by ultrafiltration such that it contained at least the equivalent of 108 CD5dml. Polysorbate 80 was dissolved in the inactivated viral antigen preparation to a concentration of 4.25√ß. This was then mixed with a light mineral oil USP containing 10 sorbitan monooleate BP in the ratio of 1 4 and emulsified. The vaccine was stored at 4 degrees C. b ImmunisationOne dose, containing at least 3 logio EIDso of H120 live vaccine, was administered to chickens intranasally at 3 weeks of age. At 16 weeks of age 0.5 ml of the VLO 10110 AVI 9 oil emulsion vaccine antigenic equivalent 7.n log10 a 50 was administered to each bird intramuscularly. Mean haemagglutination inhibition HI antibody titres to M41 of 7.0 log2 and to D274 of 8.3 log2 were obtained 8 weeks after vaccination with the oil emulsion vaccine.Example 2Preparation of bivalent oil emulsion vaccine containing inactivated strain VLo 10110 AVI 9 and strain M41 a Two batchea of ten day old SPF embryonated chicken eggs were inoculated via the silantoic cavity with 3 4 log10 CD50 of infectious bronchitis virus strain VL0 10110 AVI 9 or strain M4I. After 70 72 hours incubation at 37 OC, the allantoic fluid from each batch of eggs was harvested separately.A preservative was added to each 0.013L thiomersal and after clarification by low speed centrifugation, virus infectivity was inactivated by incubation with 0.05X ss propiolactone for 2 hours at 37 degrees C. The two batches of inactivated allantoic fluid were concentrated by ultrafiltration. Polysorbate 80 was dissolved in the inactivated viral antigen preparations to a concentration of 4.25 . These were then mixed with a light mineral oil USP containing 10S sorbitan monooleate BP in the ratio 1 4 and emulsified. The two emulsions were then mixed together in equal volumes and the bivalent vaccine stored at 4 degrees C. b Similarly, polyvalent vaccines may be prepared using the above technique but incorporating, in addition, inactivated Newcastle disease virus or inactivated Newcastle disease virus and infectious bursal disease virus. c Immunisetion One dose, containing at least 3 1ogio EIDsQ of 8120 live vaccine was administered to chickens intransasally at 3 weeks of age. At 16 weeks of age lml of the bivalent oil emulsion vaccine of a above antigenic equivalent 7.0 log10 CD50 of each virus strain was administered to each bird intramuscularly. Mean heemagglutination inhibition HI antibody titres to M41 of 10.7 log2 and D274 of 9.0 log2 were obtained 8 weeks after vaccination with the oil emulsion vaccine.Example 3Comparative test in primed and unprimed birdsThe monovalent oil emulsion vaccine prepared as in Example 1 above, or an equivalent M41 monovalent vaccine or a bivalent oil emulsion vaccine prepared as in Example 2 a above containing both viral antigens was administered both to 16 week old chickens that had been primed with live H120 a vaccine of the Massachusetts serotype widely used commercially and to 16 week old chickens which had not been primed . Haemagglutination inhibition HI antibody titres were measured at 4 and 8 weeks after vaccination. Boosted immune responses and relatively high antibody titres to the variant virus were found in birds vaccinated with the monovalent VLO 10110 AVI 9 or the bivalent oil emulsion vaccine which had previously been primed with the conventional H120 live vaccine.The antibody titres were considerably higher than the titres induced in unprimed birds. See Table 2 .It will be appreciated that the corresponding boosting of antibody titres in respect of the M41 virus when primed with H120 vaccine is conventional in that M41 and H120 are of the same serotype.

At 0, 4 and B weeks of age they were administered live H120 infectious bronchitis vaccine. At 15 weeks of age, serum samples were examined and shown to be free of antibodies to variant strains of infectious bronchitis virus. The birds were transferred to individual bird laying cages in an isolation suite. Half the birds were vaccinated with the bivalent oil emulsion vaccine of Example 2 containing inactivated strain VLO 10110 AVI 9 inactivated strain M41 and half received no further vaccine. Individual bird egg production including egg colour was recorded daily. At 30 weeks of age, the birds were challenged with a fine aerosol of strain VLO 10110 AVI 9. Vaccination of commercial pullets with a combination of live H120 and inactivated bivalent oil emulsion vaccine was successful in preventing the serious drop in egg production and adverse changes in shell quality that occurred in birds not so vaccinated when challenged at 30 weeks old.
