# COUPLING DEVICE FOR PAPER STRIPS IN A DEVELOPING MACHINE

## Abstract
A device for coupling a strip of photographic paper to a conveyor belt in a developing machine comprises a rod to which the paper strip is attached. The rod has a hook shaped end portion for gripping one lateral edge of the flat conveyor belt. Slidably mounted on the rod is a slide member formed with an obliquely projecting lip for gripping the opposite lateral edge of the belt. A spring biased toggle linkage is effective to retain the slide member in the engaged position, in which the belt is resiliently compressed between the hook shaped end portion of the rod and the lip of the slide member.
