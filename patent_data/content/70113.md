# Card frame kits.

## Abstract
A card frame kit includes end plates 10a, 10b and cross rails 16 that can be assembled together to form the card frame. The kit is packaged in a box 30 with the end plates 10a, 10b laid flat. When the kit is to be assembled, the box 30 is used as a temporary, disposable jig. To this end, inserts 40 that receive the cross rails 16 comprise slots 44 in which the side plates 10a, 10b can be stood up in the relative orientation they are to adopt in the assembled card frame. The assembler thus has his hands free to assemble at least some of the cross rails 16 to the side plates 10a, 10b to form a self supporting structure that can then be removed from the jig, if necessary or desired, to complete the assembly.
