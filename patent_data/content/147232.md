# A colour mixture indicator device.

## Abstract
The present invention discloses a set of dental colour indicator devices and a method of selecting dental colours. Each indicator device 20 has a number of colour samples 11 19 arranged in a regular array. Each of the samples corresponds to the colour at a corresponding location in an identical array formed on one of a plurality of transverse parallel cuts 26 through an elongate substantially elipsoid body 10 which represents the possible range of dental colours when graphically represented on a colour co ordinate system such as the CIELAB psycometric colour system or the Munsell visual colour system. The selected colour is either the colour of one of the samples or a mixture of the colour of two adjacent samples.
