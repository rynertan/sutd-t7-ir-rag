## Description
The present invention is concerned with a method of preparing a test plate containing a water soluble protein fraction derived from a food suitable for use in a test for human sensitivity to the food, and more particularly to a method of preparing such a protein test plate which avoids the breakdown of the water soluble proteins which are representative of the actual food used in the test. Up until the present time, it has been found difficult and or time consuming to identify accurately food sensitivities in individuals. A known method by which these may be identified is by subjecting an individual to a so called exclusion diet. This involves initially placing the individual on a very simple diet such as lamb, pears and distilled water for a period of about 5 days. Subsequently, individual foods are successively reintroduced into the diet in periods of about 5 days and the response to each food by the individual is monitored to detect any reaction. A more recent method of detecting food sensitivities involves the use of a cytotoxic test, which is a method of rapidly identifying such sensitivities by laboratory testing. This test is based on alterations in the appearance and motility of granulocytes when added to the various water soluble protein fractions. It is not yet certain why alterations do occur though it is noted that granulocytes form an important part of the human defence mechanism. To confirm the results of such a test, the above mentioned exclusion diet is still recommended. However, the diet may be restricted to include only the foods to which the individual has been found previously sensitive. The introduction of cytotoxic testing in conjunction with an exclusion diet therefore identifies food sensitivities more easily and rapidly than previously possible. The cytotoxic test itself is relatively simple, but requires a high standard of laboratory expertise in interpreting the observed morphological degeneration of granulocytes which takes place in the presence of water soluble protein fractions derived from a food. This requires a subjective evaluation of the degeneration process by a qualified technician and has provided a basis for criticism of cytotoxic tests. However, several studies have produced results from such testing having a high degree of reproducability when carried out by experienced technicians. Because the cytotoxic test is extremely sensitive it is necessary to ensure that the water soluble protein fractions suffer no contamination or decomposition during their preparation. Up until the present time, a great many of the problems associated with cytotoxic testing have been due to both the infection and the breakdown of the water soluble protein fraction during the drying process. The present invention provides both a quick and contamination free method of producing water soluble protein fractions suitable for cytotoxic testing, thus improving the overall reliability of such a test. According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of preparing a test plate containing a water soluble protein fraction derived from a food and suitable for testing for human sensitivity to the food comprising the steps of According to a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a plate for use in a test for human sensitivity to a plurality of different foods comprising a plurality of wells each having deposited therein a water soluble protein fraction derived from a different food obtainable the method described above. Finally, the present invention provides, as a further aspect a method of The present invention therefore provides a method of preparing water soluble protein fractions derived from selected foods which may be used in a test for human sensitivity to the food. In practice, a suitable test plate includes a plurality of wells, which preferably number between 40 and 60, and more preferably 48, in which a similar plurality of water soluble protein fractions are individually placed. The water soluble protein fractions of the foods may be prepared by first dispersing the selected food in purified water, separating the water soluble and insoluble fractions and then freeze drying the aqueous fraction, thus depositing the protein fraction in each well. The aqueous fraction deposited in the well may be frozen prior to the step of freeze drying. An embodiment of the invention will now be described. The food to be tested is firstly thoroughly dried. Specially prepared dried foods may be purchased from specialist suppliers such as Hollister Steir Laboratories and Crystal Laboratories. A portion of the food is dispersed in preferably from 150 to 1500 times and more preferably in about 500 times its own weight of purified water. The process of dispersion is carried out at room temperature and with agitation of the mixture for a period of preferably between 6 to 12 hours and more preferably about 8 hours. The insoluble fraction of the food, is filtered off using a known type of filter paper capable of trapping bacteria. This filter paper has a pore size of less than 2 µm. The insoluble fraction of the food which is filtered off includes any bacteria or yeasts which may have contaminated the food. As only a minute fraction of the food is required for the actual sensitivity test, one advantage of using the water soluble protein fraction of the food for testing is the ease by which very dilute solutions of this fraction can be prepared. The water used in the preparation of the water soluble protein fraction is purified to prevent any contamination with bacteria, yeasts or other substances. This water is prepared by firstly passing it through an ion exchange resin to remove any chemical impurities, and secondly, if necessary, by filtering it through a fine pored filter paper to remove bacteria and yeasts. Once the aqueous solution of the water soluble protein fraction has been prepared, then a small amount of this fraction preferably between 20 and 40 microlitres and more preferably about 30 microlitres, is added to a well formed in the test plate. The test plate preferably comprises a multiplicity e.g. 48 of such wells, and aqueous solutions of protein fractions prepared from an equal plurality of different foods are added to these wells. It is preferred that such additions are carried out by way of an automated process. An example of such a process is to control an auto sampler having a single auto pipette mounted on it with a computer to carry out the following sequence of steps A further way of automating the addition of the aqueous solutions to the wells is by prearranging a plurality of auto pipettes to have substantially the same orientation as the plurality of wells of a test plate. In use, the pipettes are simultaneously filled with the different solutions and then positioned over the test plate which is located at a predetermined position. The solutions are then simultaneously added to the appropriate wells. The test plate is then removed e.g. by conveyor, and replaced by a fresh one. The test plate is then preferably frozen in a freezer. This step prevents contamination of the solutions by bacteria and yeasts and also improves the efficiency of the freeze drying process. The frozen solutions are then freeze dried for a period sufficient to evaporate substantially all the water in which the fraction is dissolved. The freeze drying step minimises the risk of contamination of the protein fractions during the process. A further advantage of this process is that the reduced temperature avoids any risk of thermal decomposition of the protein. Preferably freeze drying is carried out for a period of between 1 to 10 hours and more preferably 4 to 8 hours. The plate is preferably freeze dried at a temperature of between 40 to 70 C and more preferably between 50 and 60 C. The pressure used during the freeze drying process is preferably between 1 x 10 ⁴ and 1 x 10 ³ millibars and more preferably about 2.5 x 10 ⁴ millibars. After the freeze drying process has been completed, only the purified water soluble protein fractions representative of the food under test remain in the wells of the test plate. Previously, in the preparation of such test plates, the water has been evaporated in the open at or above ambient temperature resulting in possible thermal decomposition of the proteins and or environmental contamination of them by airborne yeasts or bacteria. Thus protein fractions prepared in this way are generally unrepresentative of the initial foods, and give erroneous results. After the freeze drying process, the test plates may be immediately used in a cytotoxic test, or may be stored by individually wrapping them in clingfilm, and then maintaining them at a temperature of about 10 C until required for use. It is believed that the plates are capable of being stored for at least a year without deterioration. The plates used in the present invention preferably comprise a transparent plastic material, having moulded therein a plurality of wells. It is preferred that the plastic material is a homopolymer e.g. PVC or polystyrene as such polymers generally have no additives in them which might affect the sensitive cytotoxic test. The material from which the plates are formed is preferably between 0.25 and 2.0, and more preferably about 0.5 millimetres in thickness. An example of the preparation of a test plate will now be described. 10 milligrammes of 48 different dried foods obtained from Hollister Steir Laboratories and Crystal Laboratories , as set out in any one of Tables 1, 2 or 3 of the Appendix, were each dispersed at room temperature with agitation in 5 millilitres of purified water. The solutions were then filtered, and the water soluble protein fraction isolated. 30 microlitres of each of the 48 fractions were then added to separate wells formed in a cytotoxic test plate comprising PVC. The plate was then placed in a freezer, to freeze the solution. The plate was then put in an Edwards EF4 Modulyo freeze dryer for six hours at a temperature of about 55 C and at a pressure of about 2.5 x 10 ⁴ millibars. After the freeze drying process was completed, the test plate was wrapped in clingfilm and stored at 10 C for six months. The plate was then used in a cytotoxic test described below. The cytotoxic test is a rapid method of identifying food, chemical and inherent sensitivities by in vitro testing. A method of carrying out such a test is described in a paper presented by Aristo Wojdani, Elizabeth Stein, and Geoffrey Cheung at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Otolaryngicallergy on September 13 15, 1984 Las Vegas, Nevada. The preferred cytotoxic tests to be used in connection with the plates of the present invention uses fresh blood taken from a patient who has been deprived of all types of food for at least twelve hours. A sufficient quantity of blood is taken generally about 5 ml for each batch of 48 foods to be tested. A full cytotoxic test covers 144 foods protein fractions of which have been deposited on 3 plates each containing 48 protein fractions. 0.5 millilitres of 3.85 trisodium citrate per 5 ml of blood are then added to the blood, and the mixture subjected to centrifugation at 1000 revolutions per minute for 30 minutes. This process separates the mixture into three fractions, a bottom layer comprising red blood cells, a buffy layer containing white blood cells, and lastly a top layer containing plasma. The plasma and buffy layers are extracted using a long pasteur pipette, and 30 microlitres of this extract are added to each of the 48 protein fractions on the plate. The plate is then incubated for 10 minutes at 36.9 C, which corresponds to body temperature. The plates are then removed and allowed to stand for between 10 to 30 minutes. Each well of the plate is then viewed at X40 magnification under a microscope, and is examined for any abnormalities in the white cells or platelets. If no abnormalities are found then this is interpretated to be a negative reaction, and so the patient is classified as not being sensitive to the particular food found in the well. If there are abnormalities, such as lysis or removal of the cell membrane, then an allergic reaction has been shown by the patient to the food, and the strength of reaction is graded according to the range and degree of abnormalities. The system of grading currently being used is illustrated in Table 4. Where red blood cells are also extracted from the centrifuged solution, then abnormalities may also be found in these in the case of a grade 4 response. The buffy layer also contains platelets found in the blood which assist in the clotting process, and in a positive response, the platelets can be found to aggregate.
