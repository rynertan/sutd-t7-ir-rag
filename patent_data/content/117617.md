# Oil filter, and tractor hydraulic system including same.

## Abstract
In a high pressure oil filter having a replaceable element and a differential pressure relief valve which passes unfiltered oil directly from the inlet to the outlet of the filter when the element becomes blocked, damage can be caused to a precision mechanism consequently supplied with contaminated oil if the blocked element is not replaced promptly. To prevent damage and compel replacement of the element, the relief valve 16 is modified so that, when the element 12 becomes blocked, unfiltered oil passes to a secondary filter outlet 22 which by passes the precision mechanism 35, 36 and thus renders it inoperative until the element 12 is replaced. When used in an agricultural tractor, oil normally supplied to the power lift mechan ism 36 and thence for transmission lubrification 37 by passes the power lift and passes directly to the transmission when the element 12 becomed blocked. Failure of the power lift 36 to operate obliges the driver to replace the element 12 before work can recommence.

## Claims
Claims 1. An oil filter having an inlet, a replaceable element, an outlet, and a relief valve communicating with the inlet which opens when the pressure drop across the element reaches a predetermined value, characterised in that a secondary outlet communicates with the relief valve so as to receive unfiltered oil from the inlet when the element becomes blocked. 2. A tractor hydraulic system comprising a pump arranged to deliver oil under pressure to a filter having an inlet, a replaceable element, an outlet, and a relief valve communicating with the inlet which opens when the pressure drop across the element reaches a predetermined value, a power lift mechanism supplied with oil from the outlet, and transmission lubrication means supplied with oil from the power lift mechanism, characterised in that the filter has a secondary outlet communicating with the relief valve so as to receive unfiltered oil from the inlet when the element becomes blocked and pass it directly to the transmission lubrication means while the power lift mechanism is bypassed.

## Description
Oil Filter, and Tractor Hydraulic System including same The invention relates to a modification of an oil filter of the known type having an inlet, a replaceable element, an outlet, and a relief valve communicating with the inlet which opens when the pressure drop across the element reaches a predetermined value, the outlet communicating with the reief valve in such a manner that unfiltered oil passes directly from the inlet to the outlet when the element becomes blocked. The principal object of the invention is to prevent the flow of contaminated oil to components prone to damage thereby when the element becomes blocked. A further object is to oblige the driver of a tractor or the like employing such a filter to replace the element promptly when it becomes blocked. According to one aspect of the invention, in an oil filter having an inlet, a replaceable element, an outlet, and a relief valve communicating with the inlet which opens when the pressure drop across the element reaches a predetermined value, a secondary outlet cormun icates with the relief valve so as to receive unfiltered oil from the inlet when the element becomes blocked. According to another aspect of the invention, in a tractor hydraulic system comprising a pump arranged to deliver oil under pressure to a filter having an inlet, a replaceable element, an outlet, and a relief valve communicating with the inlet which opens when the pressure drop across the element reaches a predetermined value, a power lift mechanism supplied with oil from the outlet, and trans misqion lubriEation means supplied with oil from the power lift mech Bi amiss, the fitter has a secondary outlet communicating with the ret . t lief valve so as to receive unfiltered oil from the inlet when the element becomes blocked and pass it directly to the transmission lubrication means while the power lift mechanism is by passed. A preferred embodiment of the invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings of which Fig. 1 is an axial section through a relief valve incorporated in an oil filter and Fig. 2 is a schematic view of a tractor hydraulic system which includes said filter. Referring now to Fig. 1 of the drawings an oil filter 10 comprises a casing 11 which contains a replaceable element 12 seeFig. 2 capable of withstanding high pressures and has an inlet 13, and an outlet 14 for filtered oil. The inlet 13 and the outlet 14 are directly interconnected by a passage 15 in which there is disposed a differential pressure relief valve 16. The valve 16 includes a sleeve 17 having radial holes 18 by way of which its bore 19 can communicate with an annular groove 20 in its periphery 21, and the groove 20 communicates with a secondary outlet 22 in the casing 11.The sleeve 17 is sealed in the passage 15 by means of an anaerobic adhesive1 with that end of the sleeve 17 adjacent the inlet 15 abutting against a shoulder 23 in the passage 15. A disc 24 with a central orifice 25 fits in the passage 15 at that end of the sleeve 17 adjacent the outlet 14i and is retained by a circlip 26 located in the passage 15. A valve spool 27 is slideable in the bore 19 against the action of a helical compression spring 28 confined between the spool 27 and the disc 24, and a circlip 29 located in the bore 19 acts as a stop for limiting movement of the spool 27 in the direction of the inlet 13.The end faces of the spool 27 are of equal area to one another, and that remote from the spring 28 is subjected to the pressure at the inlet 13 of the filter 10 while that in contact with the spring 28 is subjected to the pressure at the outlet 14 for filtered oil. Thus the spool 27 is moved away from its stop 29 to expose the radial holes 18 and allow unfiltered oil to flow from the inlet 13 by way of the holes 18 and the annular groove 20 to the secondary outlet 22 when the difference between the pressure at the inlet 13 and that at the outlet 14, that is to say the pressure drop across the element 12, exerts a force exceeding that of the spring 28. This occurs when blocking of the element 12 causes said pressure drop to reach a value of, say, 60 pounds per square inch. The oil filter 10 is employed, for example, in the hydraulic system of an agricultural tractor. Such a system usually comprises a pump arranged to deliver oil under high pressure by way of a filter having a replaceable element initially to a power lift mechanism and thence to transmission lubrication means. hitherto, when the element has become blocked, a relief valve disposed in a passage directly interconnecting the inlet and single outlet of the filter has opened to allow unfiltered oil to be discharged by said outlet to the power lift mechanism and thence to the transmission lubrication means.Thus if the filter element has not been replaced regularly, oil containing contaminating particles has passed to the power lift mechanism and caused serious damage to the control valve means and hydraulic cylinder thereof. Referring now to Fig. 2, the hydraulic system of an agricultural tractor comprises a pump assembly 30 containing a pump 31 and a relief valve 32 and arranged to draw oil from a sump 33 by way of a strainer 34 and to deliver it under high pressure to the inlet 13 of the oil filter 10. Normally, filtered oil flows from the outlet 14 of the filter 10 initially to control valve means 35 of a power lift mechanism 36, thence to transmission lubrication means 37, and ultimately to the sump 33 in the usual way.However, when the element 12 becomes blocked the relief valve 16 opens to permit unfiltered oil to flow from the secondary outlet 22 of the filter 10 directly to the transmission lubrication means 37. The control valve means 35 and the power lift mechanism 36 are therefore bypassed and rendered inoperative when the element 12 becomes blocked, although the essential flow of oil for lubrication is maintained to the transmission which is less prone to damage by contaminating par tickles therein. Failure of the power lift mechanism 36 to operate indicates to the driver that the probable cause is a blocked filter element 12, and obliges him to replace the element before work can recoence. Analogous uses of the oil filter 10 will be apparent to the addressees of this specification.
