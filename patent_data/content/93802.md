# Test system for waveguide arc detector circuits.

## Abstract
A system for testing a wave guide arc detecting circuit 18 for a microwave system is disclosed. Testing is accom plished by utilizing a pulsed laser source 32 to generate pulses of optical energy which are used to simulate an electrical arc across the wave guide 16 . The laser source 32 is then positioned such that the pulsed output signal impinges upon the wave guide arc detector circuit 18 to be tested. This is most advantageously accomplished by affix ing the wave guide arc detector circuit 18 to the wave guide 16 in a fashion similar to normal operation. This enables the arc detecting circuit 18 to view the end of the wave guide through the interior of the wave guide 18 . The laser source 32 is positioned such that the output pulse of the laser source 32 impinges on the open end of the waveguide 16 . The operational status of the wave guide arc detecting circuit 18 is determined by measuring the elapsed time between the generation of the output pulse of the laser and the detection of the pulse by the arc detecting circuit 18 being tested.
