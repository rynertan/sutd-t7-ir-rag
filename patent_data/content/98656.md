## Description
Device for neutralizing biologically active fields. It is known that many diseases and more or less serious ailments cannot be explained or treated by the present day medical science. In the non university and non conventional scientific practice it is supposed that in a number of cases said diseases and ailments result from intensity values of local biologically active fields which are inadmissibly high for living organisms. Said fields can be detected with a high degree of certainty by means of a divining rod. Long years experience in this domain has shown that without preliminary knowledge different diviners give with great accuracy the same indications in a given situation. The invention has for its object to counteract the negative influence of said biologically active fields on living organisms and provides for this purpose a device for neutralizing such fields, said device comprising an electrically conductive strip or wire having an earth connection at the middle, said strip or wire being located substantially in one plane and being constructed in the form of a ring symmetrical to the middle, whilst the ends of the strip or wire are spaced by a small distance. Experience with the divining rod has in the meantime unambiguously proved that the intensity of the biologically active fields can be reduced to harmless proportions by using a device embodying the invention. For achieving optimum activity it is preferred to provide positioning means for a substantially horizontal disposition of the plane of the ring. Very useful is the variant in which the positioning means are formed by a ground pin fastened to the earth connection, which pin has to be inserted into the ground in a position substantially perpendicular to the plane of the ring. It may be advantageous when the device embodying the invention can be carried on the body. For this purpose it may be provided with a conductive carrying chain coupled with the earth connection. This carrying chain should be in contact with the skin. In this respect it is noted that even slight condfivi is sufficient in view of the extremely low electric current strength involved, which has been known for a long time from literature relating to the divining rod. From practical experience it has been found that even poorly conductive rubber soles have a conductive power which is sufficient for satisfactory operation of the device embodying the invention. It should be noted that a device embodying the invention carried around the neck will occupy a more or less vertical position so that no optimum results are ensured.In this regard, it is preferred to carry the device in a substantially horizontal position on the body particularly suitable thereto are the shoulders and the feet. Very satisfactory results have been obtained with a device in which the surfaces of the ends of the strip or wire are flat and substantially coincide with the plane of symmetry of the ring. In order to adapt the device to the purpose aimed at and in particular to avoid unnecessarily large dimensions it is preferred to choose the surface enclosed by the ring on te basis of the radius of the described active zone It will be obvious that the strip or wire may be made of metal. Lighter and cheaper may be variant in which the strip or wire has a core of, for example, synthetic resin surrounded by an electrically conductive layer A very important enlargement of the working zone is obtained by a variant in which the ends of the strip or wire are connected with the earth connection by means of electric conductors which may be provided with an insulating sheath. The invention will now be described with reference to the drawing of a few arbitrarily chosen embodiments. The drawing shows in Fig. 1 a perspective view of a first embodiment Fig. 2 a perspective view of a second embodiment Fig. 3 a perspective view of a third embodiment Fig. 4 a perspective view of a fourth embodiment Fig. 5 a perspective view of a fifth embodiment Fig. 6 a perspective view of a sixth embodiment Fig. 7 a perspective view of a seventh embodiment Fig. 8 a perspective view of a eighth embodiment, Fig. 9 a perspective view of a ninth embodiment and Fig. 10 a schematic, graphical representation of the active zone of the embodiments of Figs. 1 to 7, 8 and 9. Fig. 1 shows a device 1 embodying the inventionThis device 1 comprises an electrically conductive wire 2, to the middle of which is fastened an earth terminal 3.To the earth terminal 3 is secured a ground pin 4 The latter has a tip 5 at the lower end so that the pin 4 can be readily inserted into the ground in a manner such that the ground pin 4 tomes into contact with humid earth or even ground water. The conductor 2 is annularly bent so that it is located in one plane, whilst its ends 7 are at a small distance from one another. The plane of the conductor 2 is substantially normal to the direction of length of the ground pin 4 so that the conductor 2 can be readily set in a horizontal position. Fig. 2 shows a second embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment a strip 8 has a rectangular cross section in contrast to the first embodiment of Fig. 1 in which the conductor 2 has a circular cross section, whilst the shape of the strip is substantially a triangle with rounded off corners. To one of the corners is fastened an earth connection 9 with the ground pin 4. On the side opposite said corner the ends of the strip 8 are slightly spaced apart. The third embodiment shown in Fig. 3 comprises a strip 10 of pentagonal shape. To one corner is fastened the earth connection 9 with the ground pin 10. On the opposite side in the middle the ends of the strip 10 are slightly spaced apart. The cross section of the strip 10 is generally rectangular. Fig. 4 shows a fourth embodiment. A round wire 11 has an octogonal shape. On one side the earth terminal 3 is arranged with the ground pin 4 like in the embodiment of Fig. 1, whilst on the opposite side the ends of the wire 11 are located at a small distance from one another. Fig. 5 shows a fifth, simple embodiment in which the conductor 2 is provided in the middle with an earth terminal 12 to which a ground lead 13 is conductively fastened. For practical use this simple embodiment has to be disposed in an insulated manner. Only the ground lead 13 has to be connected witch the ground. Fig. 6 shows an elegant embodiment of the device in accordance with the invention. A conductive carrying chain 14 serves to carry the conductive ring 15, which is conductively connected in the middle with the chain 14. Symmetrically opposite said connection there is a small free space 16. Fig. 7 shows a device 17 having an annular conductor 2 to the middle of which is secured a conductive carrying rod 18, the lower part of which is carried by a relatively heavy foot 19. To the carrying rod 18 is fastened a ground lead 20, to the free end of which is secured a ground plug 21. This ground plug has the same shape as a conventional plug with grounded rim 22, but it is not provided with pins so that after insertion into a normal wall contact box it can solely serve for grounding purposes. All embodiments described above are constructed so that the surfaces of the ends of the strip or wire are flat and substantially coincide with the plane of symmetry of the conductive ring. Fig. 8 shows a variant differing from the embodiment of Fig. 1 by the presence of two conductors 23, 24 by which the ends 7 are conductively connected with the earth terminal 3. Fig. 9 shows an embodiment in which a ring 25 can be carried by means of a chain 26 on the body like in the embodiment of Fig. 6, whilst in accordance with the embodiment of Fig. 8 the ends 26 are connected with the middle of the ring 25 by means of conductors 29 provided with an insulating sheath 28. The operation of this embodiment is fully analogous to that of Fig. 8. Fig. 10 is a schematic representation of the active zone of the devices without electric connection between the ends and the earth terminal. The curve 28 indicates the border of the working range of the device ofFig. 1. It is inserted into the ground 29. The device 1 is operative along a depth of, for example, 5 metres, whilst the radius of the active zone at the surface may be about 20 metres. The curve 37 indicates the boundary of the active zone of the device 30 of Fig. 8. From Fig. 10, drawn approximately to scale, it appears that the activity in depth is enlarged by 100 , whilst the active radius at ground surface has increased by about 30 . It will be obvious that the embodiments described only serve to illustrate the idea of the invention and that the implementation depends on the specific purpose of use, that is to say, whether it has to be placed in the ground, to be used indoors or to be carried on the body, whilst the dimensions may be chosen in accordance with a desired active zone.
