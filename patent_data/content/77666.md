# Organotin polysiloxane and acrylic antifouling coating.

## Abstract
A marine antifouling coating composition comprises an acrylic resin e.g. polymethyl methacrylate in the range of from 6 to 20 by weight, a polysiloxane having substituted thereon organic tin moieties e.g. tributyl tin moieties that are toxic to marine organisms. The polysiloxane is in the range of from 7 to 25 by weight. The acrylic resin and polysiloxane are dissolved in a solvent in the range of from 18 to 52 by weight with the balance of the composition in the range of from 10 to 65 by weight being primarily conventional marine paint and toxicant agents for augment ing action of the tributyltin polysiloxane. Copper or copper salts that are effective for inhibiting growth of marine organisms and facilitating release of toxins can be included.
