# Sealing assembly.

## Abstract
A sealing assembly for an optical fibre feed through inhibits passage of water or gases via a fibre s protective sheath while preserving mechanical protection of the fibre. A length A A of the fibre 4 is exposed by removal of the corresponding sheath portion. Both the exposed surface of the fibre 4 and the ends 6 , 6 of the sheath 5 are sealed into a common bore 2 in a ferrule 1 . Demountable end members 9, 10 may be provided, to extend the bore 2 into which the sheath ends 6 , 6 are sealed. The sealing assembly finds particular application in opti cal fibre feed through at submarine cable repeater housing bulkheads.
