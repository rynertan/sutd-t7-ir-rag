## Description
BLOCK DIVIDED SEMICONDUCTOR MEMORY DEVICE HAVING DIVIDED BIT LINES BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a semiconductor memory device having memory cells divided into a plurality of separated blocks. Description of the Related Art In recent years, dynamic metal oxide semiconductor MOS random access memory RAM devices have been enlarged to 16 kbits, 64 kbits, and 256 kbits. Thus as the integration density becomes higher, the number of memory cells connected to one bit line becomes larger, increasing the length of bit lines, and increasing the capacitance per one bit line. Simultaneously, the storage capacitance per one memory cell is reduced.As a result, the ratio of the capacitance of a bit line to the storage capacitance of a memory cell, i.e., a so called C ratio for determining the accuracy of read data, is deteriorated. To avoid this, in the prior art, it has been suggested to increase the storage capacity of a memory cell by improving the memory cell configuration, i.e., by reducing the thickness of the insulating layers within the memory cell, and in addition, to divide a memory cell array into a plurality of blocks, shortening the bit line length, thus reducing the capacitance thereof. For example, when a n x n matrix configuration is divided into a two division configuration such as n x n 2 x 2, or four division configuration such as n x n 4 x 4, the number of memory cells connected to one bit line is reduced and the capacitance of one bit line is also reduced. In a prior art block divided RAM, a series of column decoders are required for each block, thus increasing the area occupied by column decoders, which is disadvantageous to integration. In addition, data buses are also required for each block, and accordingly, the circuits for writing data and reading data via the data buses are complex. In order to improve this, it is already known to construct only one series of column decoders in a block divided RAM see Fig. 7 of United States PatentNo. 4,122,546 . In such a RAM, however, since bit lines of each block are forcibly connected to each other, and the resistance of transfer gates for connecting the bit lines to each other is large, the read rewrite operation speed is deteriorated. In addition, it is impossible to apply such a RAM to a RAM having open bit lines. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide a block divided RAM having a high read rewrite operation speed which can be also applied to a RAM having open bit lines. According to the present invention, a plurality of partial bit lines are provided separately for each of the blocks, and a plurality of bus bit lines are provided commonly for the respective partial bit lines of each of the blocks transfer gates are linked between the partial bit lines and the bus bit lines. The data of each memory cell is transferred from the respective partial bit lines via the turned ON transfer gates to the respective bus bit lines. Since the bus bit lines are provided in parallel to the partial bit lines, the data of each cell array block is transmitted by only one step via the transfer gates linked between the partial bit line and the bus bit lines, and accordingly, there is no possibility of the operation delays by the transfer gates being serially stored. For addition, since a small number of transfer gates are connected to the bus bit lines, and accordingly, the capacitance thereof is remarkably smaller than that of a bit line to which a large number of cells are connected, this is helpful in high speed operation.In addition, since only one clock signal for driving the transfer gates has to be pulled up, the configuration of a bootstrap circuit is simple. Further, since only one partial bit line pair has to be charged up or discharged, the current therefor is small.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFEPRED EMBODIMENTS In Fig. 1, which illustrates a prior art RAM having folded bit lines, 64 kbit memory cells are divided into two blocks, i.e., memory cell arrays 128 x 256 bits 1 and 2. Arranged on the side of the memory cell array are a series of sense amplifiers SA1 and á series of column decoders CD1. Also arranged on the side of the memory cell array 2 are a series of sense amplifiersSA2 and a series of column decoders CD2. ReferenceRD designates a row decoder. Thus, the illustrated configuration has almost half the bit line length as compared with a one block configuration RAM having a series of sense amplifiers and a series of column decoders, and accordingly, the C ratio is halved. However, column decoders are necessary for each of the blocks, that is, two series of column decoders are necessary, requiring twice the area to be occupied by the column decoders as compared with the one block configuration, which is disadvantageous to integration. In addition, since data buses DB1 and DB , and DB2 and DB2 2 and do2 are provided for the blocks, one of the write amplifiers WA1 and WA2 is selected by a selection circuit SEL1 during a write mode for data Din t and one of the output data D outi and Dout2of theoutput buffers OB1 and OB2 is selected as data Doubt by a selection circuit SEL2 during a read mode. Thus, data buses are provided for each of the blocks and the circuits for writing data and reading data become complex. In Fig. 2, note that references Ao , o , ..., A7 A7 designate row address signals generated by the row address buffers not shown , and reference A8 , A8 A15 A15 , A15 designate column address signals generated by the column address buffers not shown . Among these, the signals A7 and A7 are used for selecting one of the blocks.References Q1 and Q1 are transfer gate transistors linked between the bit lines BL1 and BL1 and the data buses DB1 and DB1 , and references Q2 and Q2 are transfer gate transistors linked between the bit linesBL2 and TL and the data buses DB2 and DB2 Reference XLE designates a latch enable signal for enabling the sense amplifiers SA1 AND SA2. In Fig. 2, which illustrates a prior art RAM having open bit lines, 64 kbit memory cells are also divided into two blocks. That is, memory cell arrays 64 x 256 bits 1 1 and 1 2 belong to the first block, while memory cell arrays 64 x 256 bits 2 1 and 2 2 belong to the second block. Arranged between the memory cell arrays 1 1 and 1 2 are a series of sense amplifiers SA1 and a series of column decoders CD1. Also arranged between the memory cell arrays 2 1 and 2 2 are a series of sense amplifiers SA2 and a series of column decoders CD2.Regarding the remaining configuration, the RAM of Fig. 2 is the same as that of Fig. 1. Therefore, in the RAM ofFig. 2, column decoders are also necessary for each of the blocks, that is, two series of column decoders are necessary, requiring twice the area to be occupied by the column decoders as compared with the one block configuration. In addition, data buses are provided for each of the blocks, and the circuits for writing data and reading data also become complex. Further, in a dynamic RAM having a plurality of blocks, it is already known to construct one series of column decoders, for example, as shown in Fig. 7 ofUSP 4,122,546. The example given in Fig. 3 shows a two block divided RAM having a one column configuration selected by a column decoder CD. In Fig. 3, BL1 andBL2 are partial bit lines formed by dividing one bit line and BL1 and BL1 are complementary partial bit lines formed by dividing another bit line, and each of them is paired with the partial bit lines BL1 and L2. In this case, one bit line is divided into two, and accordingly, the C ratio is halved. As a result, the initial difference in potential before the sense amplifier operates becomes large. Linked between the partial bit lines BL1 and BL2 BL1 to BL2 are transfer gates Q1 and Q2 Q1 and Q21 . Provided in each of the parts of the bit lines is a sense amplifier SA1 SA2 .Reference AR designates an active restore circuit provided between the bit lines BL3 and YL Provided between the bit lines BL3 and BL3 and the data busesDB and DB are transfer gates Q0 and Q01 selected by a column select signal CS from the column decoder CD. References LEland LE1 are clocks for enabling the sense amplifiers SA1 and SA2 T1 and T2 are clock signals for turning ON the transfer gates Q1 and Q1 Q2 and Q2 and XAR is a clock signal for enabling the active restore circuit AR. The clock signals LE1 and LE2 are generated by a selection circuit SEL3 , which is illustrated in detail in Fig. 4. The operation of the circuit of Fig. 3 will be explained with reference to Fig. 5. In a stand by mode, the partial bit lines BL1 , BL1 , BL2 t and BL 2 are precharged at Vcc 2 by the precharging circuits not shown . When the data l is stored in the memory cell MC, the capacitor of the memory cell MC is charged at Vcc , and when the data 0 is stored in the memory cell MC, the capacitor of the memory cell MC is charged at Vss U . During a selecting mode, at time to t in order to select the word line WL1 , the potential at the word line WL1 is raised to a level higher than Vcc As a result, the data of the memory cell MC appears at the bit lines BL1 or BL , thus generating a very small difference between the bit lines BL1 and BL1 BL1 BL1 for example . Then, at time t1 , the clock signal LE1 is generated so as to activate the sense amplifier SA1.In this case, the sense amplifier SA1 comprises a flip flop in which one transistor is turned ON and the other transistor is turned OFF by the very small difference in potential. The bit line BL1 connected to the turned ON transistor falls to V55 level, thus generating a large difference in potential between the bit lines BL1 and BL1.Thus, at time t2 t when such a large difference occurs between the bit lines BL1 and BL1 , both the clock signals XT1 and XT2 are pulled up to turn ON the transfer gates Ol and 91 Q2 andTherefore, the potentials at the bit lines BL1 and BL are transmitted sequentially from the bit lines BL1 and BL to the bit lines BL2 and BL2. Then, at time t3 when a difference is generated in potential between the final bit lines BL3 and BL3 , the clock signal XAR is pulled up to operate the active restore circuit AR. The active restore circuit AR pulls the higher one of the potentials at the bit lines BL3 and BL3 in this case, BL3 up to Vcc , thereby amplifying the difference in potential between the bit lines BL3 and BL3. After the operation of the active restore circuit AR is completed, at time t4 , the column select signal CS is pulled up so as to turn on the transfer gates Q0 and Q0 . By the sequence of the above mentioned operations, the data of the cell MC is read out to the data buses DB and Ds. Simultaneously, when the bit line BL3 rises up to Vcc t the change in potential is transmitted therefrom via the transfer gates Q 2 and Q1 in the reverse direction to the bit line BL1 on the memory cell MC. That is, the potential at the bit line BL1 rises to Vcc. Thus, a re writing operation upon the read cell MC is carried out by the potentials BL1 Vcc and BL1 Vss. At time t5 , the re writing operation is completed. In Fig. 3, however, since the read and re writing operation has to be carried out by multi steps such as the partial bit lines BL1 BL1 and BL2 BL2 and the transfer gates Q1 Q1 and Q2 Q2 the time period from t2 to t3 and the time period from t4 to t5 are long.Such long time periods are due to the fact that the transfer gates Q1 Q1 and Q2 Q2 cannotbe large. That is, one reason for the limitation of size of the transfer gates is that the pitch of the cells is small because of the high integration, and in that the gate area of each of the transfer gates is preferably large in view of effectively carrying out the bootstrap effect. That is, the clock signals XT1 and XT2 for driving the transfer gates are pulled up to a potential higher than Vcc as shown in Fig. 4. Since such a pulling up operation is carried out by the bootstrap circuit not shown , it is necessary to reduce the gate capacitance of the transfer gates. As explained above, the transfer gates Q1 Q1 and Q2 Q2 are small in size, however, this reduces the value gm thereof, so that the ON resistance thereof cannot be neglected. In addition, a large number of memory cells are connected to one bit line, thereby increasing the parasitic capacitance thereof. As a result, the ON resistance of the transfer gates Q1 Q1 and Q2 Q2 and the parasitic capacitance of the partial bit lines form a large CR time constant circuit which reduces the change in potential. Therefore, in a configuration as shown in Fig. 3, in which data is read by multisteps and data is rewritten by multisteps, the read rewrite cycle is large. The configuration of Fig. 3 can be enlarged to a four block divided RAM as illustrated in Fig. 6. That is, memory cells are divided into memory cell arrays 1, 2, 3, and 4. In addition, transfer gates Q3 , Q3 , Q4 Q4 , and sense amplifiers SA3 and SA4 are added to the elements of Fig. 3. Also, a selection circuit SEL3 for generating the latch enable signals LE1 , LE2, LE3 t and LE4 as shown in Fig. 7 is used instead of the selection circuit SEL3 of Fig. 3. In Fig. 6, one bit line is divided into four, and accordingly, the C ratio is quartered. As a result, the initial difference in potential before the sense amplifier operates becomes large. The operation of the circuit of Fig. 6 is shown inFig. 8 which is similar to Fig. 5. That is, at time to when all the clock signals XT1 to iT4 are pulled up to turn ON the transfer gates Q1 Q1 to Q4 Q4 , the potentials at the bit lines BL1 and EL1 are transmitted sequentially from the bit lines EL2 and EL2 t via EL3 and EL3 , and EL4 and EL4 to BLo and BLo. Then at time t3 , when a difference is generated in potential between the final bit lines BLo and BLo t the clock signal jAR is pulled up to operate the active restore circuit AR. Thus, compared with Fig. 5, the time period from t2 to t3 becomes long due to the increased number of blocks. Further, the time period from t4 to t5 for a rewriting mode also becomes long due to the increased number of blocks. Thus, the read rewrite time period becomes remarkably large when the number of blocks is increased. Further, it is impossible to apply the circuit of Figs. 3 and 6 to a RAM having open bit lines as illustrated in Fig. 2, which is fatally disadvantageous. In Fig. 9, which illustrates a first embodiment of the present invention, a two block divided RAM having folded bit lines is illustrated. In Fig. 9, a pair of bus bit lines BLo and BLo are provided commonly for the partial bit lines BL1 and EL of the memory cell array 1 and the partial bit lines BL2 and EL2 of the memory cell array 2. Linked between the partial bit lines BL1 and BL1 , and the bus bit lines BL0 and BL0 are the transfer gates Q1 and Q1 . Also linked between the partial bit lines BL2 and BL2 , and the bus bit lines BL0 and BL0 are the transfer gates Q2 and Q2 . Note that the bit lines BL1 and BL1 , and the bit lines BL2 and BL2 have the same column address. References T1and T2 are clock signals for activating the transfer gates Q1 and Q1 and Q2 and Q21, respectively, and are obtained by delaying the latch enable signals LE1 and LE2 , respectively. The operation of the circuit of Fig. 9 will be explained with reference to Fig. 10. In a stand by mode, the partial bit lines BL1 , 7L1 , EL2 t and EL 2 are precharged at Vcc 2 by the precharging circuits not shown . When the data 1 is stored in the memory cell MC, the capacitor of the memory cell MC is charged at Vcc t and when the data tto 0 is stored in the memory cell MC, the capacitor of the memory cell MC is charged at Vss t 0 . During a selecting mode, at time to , in order to select the word line WL1 , the potential at the word line WLl is raised to a level higher than Vcc.As a result, the data of the memory cell MC appears at the bit lines BL1 and BL1 , thus generating a very small difference between the bit lines BL1 and BL1 EL1 EL1 for example . Then, at time t1 , the clock signal LE1 is generated so as to activate the sense amplifier SA1. As a result, the bit line BL1 connected to the turned ON transistor falls to V55 level, thus generating a large difference in potential between the bit lines BL1 and BL1.Thus, at time t2 ,when such a large difference occurs between the bit lines BL1 and BL1 , only one of the clock signals T1 and T2 is pulled up to turn ON the transfer gates Q1 and Q1 . Therefore, the potentials at the bit lines BL1 and B L1 are transmitted to the bit lines BL0 and BL0. Then, at time t3 , when a difference is generated in potential between the bit lines BL0 and BL0 t the clock signal XAR is pulled up to operate the active restore circuit AR.After the operation of the active restore circuit AR is completed, at time t4 the column select signal CS is pulled up so as to turn on the transfer gates Q0 and Q0 . Thus, the data of the cell MC is read out to the data buses DE and DB. Simultaneously, when the bit line BL0 rises up to Vcc, the change in potential is transmitted to the bit line EL1 on the memory cell MC. That is, the potential at the bit line BL1 rises to Vcc. Thus, a re writing operation upon the read cell MC is carried out by the potentials EL1 Vcc and EL1 Vss. At time t5S the re writing operation is completed. Since the time period from t1 and t2 of Fig. 10 includes the delay time caused by only one stage of the transfer gates Q1 and Q11, this time period is remarkably shortened as compared with the corresponding time period from t2 to t3 of Fig. 5. Note that the circuit ofFig. 9 can be applied to a multiple block configuration.Also, in this case, the time period from t1 to t2 is substantially the same. In Fig. 11, which illustrates a second embodiment of the present invention, sense amplifiers SA11 and SA21 incorporating active restore functions are provided instead of the sense amplifiers SA1 and SA2. For example, as illustrated in Fig. 12, the sense amplifier SA11 is comprised of cross coupled P channel MOS transistors Ql and Q2 t and cross coupled N channel MOS transistors Q3 and Q4. In this case, the transistors Q1 and Q2 form a flip flop which pulls up the higher one of the potentials at the nodes N1 and N2 t i.e., at the bit lines EL1 and EL1 , when the clock signal LE1 is pulled up.Thus, the transistors Q1 and Q2 carry out an active restore function. Contrary to this, the transistors Q3 and Q4 form also a flip flop which pulls down the lower one of the potentials at the nodes N1 and N2 Z i.e., at the bit lines BI 1 and EL1 , when the clock signal LE1 is pulled down. Thus, the transistors Q3 and Q4 carry out an original sense amplifying function. The clock signals LE LE1 XLE2 LE2 XT1 XT2 are generated by a row control and refresh circuit 5 which receives the row address signals A0 to 7 , 7. In the row control and refresh circuit 5, one word line of the memory cell array 1 is carried out by using the row address signals Ao , o , ..., A6 x A6 t and A7 while one word line of the memory cell array 1 is carried out by using the row address signals Ao , o , ..., A6, A6 t and A In a refresh mode, the potentials of the row address signals A7 and A are both caused to be low within the circuit 5, thereby selecting two word lines such as WL1 and WL2. In an access mode such as a read mode or a write mode, only one of the memory cell arrays 1 and 2 is operated. That is, data of a memory cell of the array 1 or 2 is transmitted from the respective partial bit lines via the respective bus bit lines to the data buses DE and DB. Selection of the memory cell arrays 1 and 2 is carried out by the row address signals A7 and 7. On the other hand, it is always necessary to perform a refresh operation upon the memory cells of a dynamic RAM, in order to avoid the destruction of information stored in the memory cells due to the current leak. The number of refresh operations can be reduced by simultaneously activating a plurality of sense amplifiers and a plurality of memory cells. For this purpose, in a refresh mode, both of the memory cell arrays 1 and 2 are activated. In this case, two word lines such as WL1 and WL2 are selected, and the sense amplifiers SA1 and SA2 are activated, but the clock signals XT1 and XT2 are not activated. Note that only one of the clock signals XT1 and XT2 can be also activated. The operation of the circuit of Fig. 11 will be explained with reference to Figs. 13 and 14. Referring to Fig. 13, which shows a read rewrite operation, it is assumed that the capacitor of the memory cell MC is charged at Vcc. Then at time to when the control enters a selecting mode for the memory cell MC, the potential at the word line WLl is raised to a level higher than Vcc , thus generating a very small difference in potential between the partial bit lines EL1 and BL1. In this case, the potential is higher at the partial bit line EL1 than at the partial bit line BL1.Then at time t1 , the clock signal LE1 is pulled up to Vcc t and simultaneously, the clock signal LE1 is pulled down to V55 t thereby activating the sense amplifier SA1 . As explained above, the sense amplifier SA1 also incorporates an active restore function, the higher of the potentials at the partial bit lines BL1 and BL1 is pulled up, and simultaneously, the lower potential is pulled down.Then at time t2 the clock signal XT1 is pulled up to a level higher than Vcc , so as to turn ON the transfer gates Q1 and Q11, the potentials at the partial bit lines BL1 and BL1 are transmitted via the turned ON transfer gatesQ1 and Q1 to the bus bit lines BL0 and BL0. That is, the potentials at the bus bit lines BL0 and EL0 follow the potentials at the partial bit lines BL1 and EL1, respectively. Then, at time t3 , the column selection signal CS is pulled up by the column decoder CD to Vcc so as to turn ON the transfer gates Q0 and Q0 , the potentials at the bus bit lines BL0 and EL are transferred via the turned ON transfer gates Q0 and Q0 to the common data buses DB and DE, respectively. Thus, a read rewrite operation for the memory cell MC is completed. In such a read rewrite operation, the clock signals LE2 and XLE2 remain at Vcc 2, since none of the memory cells within the memory cell array 2 are selected.Also, the clock signal XT2 remains at Vss, since it is unnecessary to turn ON the transfer gates Q2 and Q2 Since the time period from t1 to t2 of Fig. 13 includes the delay time caused by only one stage of the transfer gates Q1 and Q11, this time period is remarkably shortened as compared with the corresponding time period from t2 to t3 of Fig. 5. Further, since an active restore operation, i.e., a pulling up operation, is carried out simultaneously with the sensing operation, the time period from t3 to t4 of Fig. 5 is eliminated, so that the read rewrite time period can be remarkably small as compared with the circuit of Fig. 3. In addition, in Fig. 11, since the common data buses DE and DE are provided commonly for the blocks, i.e., the memory cell arrays 1 and 2, only one write amplifier WA is needed for writing data Din t and only one Output buffer circuit OB is needed for reading data Doubt Note that a write read control operation is carried out by the write control circuit not shown . Referring to Fig. 14, which shows a refresh operation, at time to t the potential at the word line Will and the potential at the word line WL2 are both raised to a level higher than Vcc. As a result, a very small difference in potential is generated between the partial bit lines EL1 and EL1 , and a very small difference in potential is also generated between the partial bit lines EL2 and BL2. Then, at time t1 , the clock signals LE1 and LE2 are pulled up to Vcc t and simultaneously, the clock signals LE1 and LE2 are pulled down to Vss. As a result, the higher of the potentials at the partial bit lines BL and EL1 is pulled up, and simultaneously, the lower potential is pulled down. Similarly, the higher of the potentials at the partial bit lines EL2 and EL 2 is pulled up, and simultaneously, the lower potential is pulled down. Thus, at time t2 g a refresh operation is completed.In such a refresh operation, since no transfer of data is required from the partial bit lines EL1 and EL1 or EL2 and BL2 to the bus bit lines BLo and BLo t it is unnecessary to pull up the clock signals dT1 and XT2. That is, the time period from t2 to t4 for T2 a transfer mode and a column selecting mode becomes unnecessary for a refresh operation. The configuration of Fig. 11 can be enlarged to a four block divided RAM which is illustrated in Fig. 15.That is, memory cells are divided into memory cell arrays 1, 2, 3, and 4. In addition, transfer gatesQ3 , Q3 , Q4 , Q4 , and sense amplifiers SA3 and SA4, are added to the elements of Fig. 11. Also, a row control and refresh circuit 5 of the row control and refresh circuit 5 of Fig. 11. In Fig. 15, one bit line is divided into four, and accordingly, the C ratio is quartered. As a result, the initial difference in potential before the sense amplifier operates becomes large. The operation of the circuit of Fig. 15 is similar to that of the circuit 9 see brackets of Fig. 13 .That is, in a read rewrite operation, the read rewrite time period is also dependent upon only one stage of the transfer gates such as Q1 and Q1 and accordingly, this read rewrite time period is substantially the same as the time period from to to t4 of Fig. 13. Also, in a refresh operation see brackets of Fig. 14 , the refresh time period seems about the same but is actually a little smaller, since the C ratio is small as compared with the circuit of Fig. 11. The present invention is applied to a dynamic RAM having open bit lines, as shown in Figs. 16 and 17.Figure 16 illustrates a two block divided RAM, andFig. 17 illustrates a four block divided RAM. In Figs.16 and 17, a series of sense amplifiers SA1, SA2,, SA3 ,So4 are provided between the memory cell arrays 1 1 and 1 2 2 1 and 2 2, 3 1 and 3 2, 4 1 and 4 2 . The other portions of Figs. 16 and 17 are the same as those of Figs. 11 and 15, respectively. In addition, the operations of the circuits of Figs. 16 and 17 are the same as those of the circuits of Figs. 11 and 15, respectively. In Figs. 18, 19, and 20 r which illustrate other embodiments of the present invention, a pair of bus bit lines are provided for four pairs of partial bit lines in a two block divided RAM. That is, a pair of bus bit lines BLO and Bil 0are provided for four pairs of bit lines BL1 , EL1 EL11, EL11 BL2 t BL2 and BL2 ,BL2 . In Fig. 18, which illustrates a RAM having folded bit lines, in a read rewrite operation for a memory cell, one word line such as Wil1 within the memory cell array 1 or one word line such as Wil2 within the memory cell array 2 is selected, and a series of the sense amplifiers SA1 or a series of the sense amplifiersSA2 are activated. Further, only one pair of the partial bit lines BL1 , BL1 , BL1 , EL11 BL2 , BL2 and BL3 , BL3 are selected by one of the clock signals Tl , T2 , T3 t and T4 and are connected to the bus bit lines BL0 and BL0.Contrary to this, in a refresh mode, one word line such as Will within the memory cell array 1 and one word line such as Wil2 within the memory cell array 2 are selected, and a series of the sense amplifiers SA1 and a series of the sense amplifiersSA2 are activated. However, no clock signals T1 T2, T3, t and T4 are generated, and accordingly, none of the partial bit lines BL1 , BL1 , BL1 , BL1 BL2 t BL2, and BL3 , BL3 are connected to the bus bit lines BL0 and EL0. Figure 19 illustrates a RAM using open bit lines, which has almost the same configuration as that ofFig. 18. In the circuits of Figs. 18 and 19, the clock signals t T2, t T3, and T4 for connecting the partial bit lines to the bus bit lines are generated by the row addresses Ao A o to A7 , A7 , not by the column addresses A8, A8 to A15 , 15. This avoids the disadvantage wherein the connection of the partial bit lines to the bus bit lines cannot be carried out prior to the determination of the column addresses, if the above mentioned clock signals are generated by the column addresses.Therefore, in the row control and refresh circuit 5 of Figs. 18 and 19, in a read rewrite operation among the row addresses Ao to A7 , the word lines are decoded by the address Ao to A5 , and the selection of the connection of the bus bit lines is carried out by the addresses A6 and A7. As a result, as compared with the embodiments of Figs. 11 and 16, the number of cells per one bit line is halved while the number of cells along the word line direction is doubled.That is, in Figs. 11 and 16, one block is constructed by 256 word lines x 256 bit lines, while in Figs. 16 and 17, one block is constructed by 128 word lines x 512 bit lines. Since only 256 bits of the 512 bit lines can be connected to the bus bit lines, the column width of each bus bit line is the same as in the cases of Figs. 11 and 16. As explained above, one block is constructed by a 128 x 512 cell configuration, and accordingly, the chip has a very long shape. In order to avoid this, it is preferable to take the following measures i to modify the cell configuration by changing the ratio of the lengthwise dimension to the crosswise dimension of a cell, or ii to arrange the decoder at the center of the cell arrays, so that the cell arrays on each side are selected by the column addresses. In the latter case, in Figs. 18 and 19, the entire configuration is divided into an upper portion and a lower portion, and the upper Portion is rotated by 1800 and is arranged on the right side of the lower portion. Thus, the column decoders are common to both of the portions.Thus, when the column decoders are common to the portions the upper and lower portions prior to the division thereof , the column addresses A8 to A14 are effective for the 128 bits, and therefore, another column address bit A15 is used for selecting the portions. Thus, it is possible by two bits of the row addresses to select and connect the partial bit lines to the bus bit lines. Figure 20 also illustrates a RAM having folded bit lines. For example, in the memory cell array 1 , when the bit lines EL1 and TL are connected to the sense amplifier SA1 by the column address signalsA15 and A15 , the bit lines BL1 and BL1 are connected to the sense amplifier SA2. Conversely, when the bit lines BL1 and EL 1 are connected to the sense amplifierSA1 , the bit lines EL1 and Et are connected to the sense amplifier SA2. Further, only the bit lines connected to the sense amplifier SA1 can be connected to the bus bit lines BL0 and BLO. That is, also inFig. 18, in a read rewrite operation, one pair of four pairs of partial bit lines are connected to the bus bit lines. In the above mentioned embodiments, a RAM of a two block or four block configuration is illustrated, however, the present invention can be applied to a device of a multiple block configuration such as an eight block configuration, .... As explained above, according to the present invention, since bus bit lines are added along the bit lines to which a large number of cells are connected, and the bit lines are divided into a plurality of blocks each of which is connected to the bus bit lines via the transfer gates, there is an advantage in that the read rewrite cycle can be reduced when the C ratio is improved by the division of bit lines. For example, in a one transistor dynamic RAM having four divided bit lines, the time period for transmitting data from the memory cells to the data buses can be reduced to about 1 3 according to the present invention. Also, the present invention can be applied to an open bit line configuration RAM as well as a folded bit line configuration RAM.
