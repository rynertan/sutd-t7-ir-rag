## Description
Description of the invention whose name is system formed by any type of needle which can be used only once having threaded and or steadily fastener to one of its ends, one or more sewing threads, that can contribute to facilitate and accelerate se wing of clothes, various manufactured articles, but tons and similar items , This invention is a system formed by any type of ne edle that can be used only once which has one or more sewing threads threaded and or steadily faste ned to one of its ends it allows to facilitate and accelerate sewing of clothes, various manufactured articles, buttons and other items.It is well known that, in order to sew any type of garment, or to sew a button, at present, you must have a needle and an adequate type of thread, separa tely, then you have to insert the thread into the eye of the needle.Negative consequences are evident you waste time and may have considerable practical, operative dif ficulties in inserting the thread into the eye of the needle hia invention is composed of a system formed by a needle any type of needle as for its size and mate rial it is made of and one or more sewing threads fastened to one of its ends. lEis needle with thre ads can be used only once and, after its use, it is discarded. It helps in facilitating and accelera ting the tacking and or sewing of cloth and tailo ring of garments and, in particular, fastening but tons and similar items.This system is very useful because it replaces the traditional needle separa ted by the thread and thus eliminates the act of inserting the thread into the eye of the needle.In fact, this operation, although simple, calls for a steady hand and an excellent sight thus it is particularly useful for those who do not possess these two characteristics.Another positive aspect Is that it allows to couple more threads on a single so that it can achieve the number of times it is necessary to insert the thre ad, let s say, into the button s holes and make these threads wind and through the cloth underneath, with minimum sewing operations.In fact, it is evident that, since the needle, in this case, is provided with many threads, it is enough to insert it only once into the cloth and then into the button s hole, and soon afterward, in the second stage, it goes back to the second ho le and into the adjacent cloth.If the button has four holes, repeat the abovementioned operations inserting threads through the third and fourth hole .You can fasten the two free standing thread ends one of which is fastened to the needle by simply knotting the two ends together.Thus it is necessary to cut the two grops of left threads, near the knot, and your sewing operation is over, in the quickest possible way.Of course, if some thread has been left on the needle, you can repeat sewing operations and fa stening of buttons many times, until no more thread is left.If we go to the details, we can say that this in vention is formed by a needle of any type or si ze with or without any eye.One or more sewing threads they can have any dia metre, lenght, resistance, and colour are fastened to this needle, that is used only once, until you use up all thread fastened to it. The thread s lengilt depends on what you need to perform your ope ration 0It is extremely simple to sew a cloth or to fasten a button you just have to insert a needle with its thread threaded as usual first through the two adjacent pieces of cloth stage one if you have to sew them or the cloth and the button to sew then insert again stage two, when you go back the needle with thread inserting it into the pieces of cloth or into another hole in the button . Thus the two ends the one fastened to the needle and the other one are on the same side of the cloth.Now knot these two ends together with one or more knots stage three then cut the two ends, near the knot stage four . In this way you have made a stitch, which is independent of other stitches.Go on until you have finished the thread connected to the needle.Notice that, unlike trad itional needles, that are provided with eyes, and made of special steel, and therefore expensive, it is advisable to make this needle with a thread that can be used only once, of a cheap material, such as plastic or plastic with an inner part in resistant metal, to give it brigs tness, resistance and to allow threads to be faste ned easily.This needle can also be made of a cheap, but resist ant metal, ending with a plastic base which should contain and fasten sewing thread or threads sccord ing to its their possible use. Moreover, threads can be joined and glued fore example to each o ther, at regular intervals, in order to keep them together, when cut.This invention solves finally the problem of hand sewing, in the fastest and most functional way, since it allows the maximum operation speed, safety and firmness, and it eliminates difficulties in inserting the thread into the needle s eye0Of course, the whole series of threads of various diametres, lenghts, and colours can be stored in containers or envelops, in order to rationalize their usage.For the better understanding of this invention we enclose a drawing and its description, that show an example of its possible implementation.Drawing N0 1 tig. 1 shows the perspective of a button to sew on a piece of cloth with needle and thread passing upward phase one Fig. 2 shows the perspective of the same button to sew on the piece of cloth downwards phase two Fig 3 shows the transverse section of the same button to sew on the piece of cloth, with the two end of thread during the knotting operation phase three .More exactly this invention is made up of a needle 1 to this needle 1, 2 or more sewing threads 3 are fastened. The sewing operation is very simple insert, by hand, as usual, needle 1 through cloth 4 and one hole of button 5 stage one , then insert the nee dle 1 into the ajacent hole of button 5 stage twos now the two ends of the threads 3 are parallel and dangling, under the cloth 4 you can simply knot threads 3 together with one or more knots and you have sewed button 5 to cloth 4 in the safest, quickest and stablest way stage three .These two ends are cut, until you have exhausted threads 3 and needle 1 is thrown away.Of course Table 1, with its figures, and its des cripion is only a sort of an example and thus, it can be largely modified during the construction of this system, as long as they comply with the conce tual and functional features of the invention.
