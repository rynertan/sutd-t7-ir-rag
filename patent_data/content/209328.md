# SCREW EXTRUDERS

## Abstract
A screw extruder comprises a barrel 10 having a chamber 12 in which a screw 14 is mounted for rotation about an axis A. Sets of pins 22 project from the barrel into annular zones 24, 25 of the chamber 12, interrupting flights 26, 28, 30, 32 of the screw. The flights at either side of the, or each, annular zone 24 are displaced angularly relative to one another so that at either side of each annular zone 24 the flights are staggered. End portions of adjacent flights at either side of each annular zone 24 overlap. Material processed may have less temperature variation and improved homogeneity compared with material processed by previously known extruders.
