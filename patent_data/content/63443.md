# A digital waveform conditioning circuit.

## Abstract
A digital waveform conditioning circuit is disclosed for restoring a deformed digital signal 2B into its original rectangular waveform 2A . The circuit comprises an input terminal 10 supplied with the deformed digital signal, a circuit 17 to 24 for generating a reference signal Vr by combining positive and negative cycles of the deformed signal, a comparator 11 for comparing the deformed signal with the reference signal, a circuit 26 for holding an output signal 2C of the comparator for a period controlled by a clock signal R CK for synchronising the output signal with the original rectangular signal, and an output terminal 28 for receiving the output of the holding circuit.
