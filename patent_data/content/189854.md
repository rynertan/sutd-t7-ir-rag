## Description
The present invention relates to a communication system and to a method of operating it capable of interruption talk during data transmission, and, more particularly, to a radio communication system and to a method of operating it capable of interruption talk during data transmission by polling between a fixed central station and a plurality of mobile terminal units. A conventional radio communication system of this kind comprises a central station and a plurality of terminal units such as mobile units. The central station sends digital polling signals to the terminal units and receives response data signals from the terminal units, respectively. During the time when data transmission is performed by polling operation, etc., it has been inhibited to make a free talk from terminal units in order to avoid any data destruction by collision. This has caused inconveniences, such as impossibility of talk even in an emergency or the like. A further example of a communication system known from the prior art is given in the Patent Abstract of Japan, vol. 4, no. 189 E 39 671 , 25th December 1980. The purpose of the present invention is, therefore, to provide a new communication system and a new method of operating it that is capable of realizing an interruption talk even during polling operation. As described above, the present invention provides a communication system comprising a central station, and a plurality of terminal units linked thereto, The present invention will hereinafter be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings In Fig. 1 showing a radio communication system to which the present invention is applicable, the terminal units 1₁, 1₂, 1₃, . . . 1 Fig. 2 shows a block diagram of the equipments of the terminal units and of the central station shown, in Fig. 1, in the style common to the terminal units and the central station. The information data generated from an information generator 11 comprising keys, sensors, etc. are processed by a controller 12, converted to baseband signals, for example, FSK signals, PSK signals by a modulator demodulator 13 and supplied to a data voice switching section 14. The controller 12 controls the data voice switching section 14 to control the transmission and reception of the data and or voice, as described hereinafter. On the other hand, a tranceiver 15 also is connected to the data voice switching section 14. In the case of half duplex communication system or the like, a transmission start signal may be sent from the tranceiver 15 to the controller 12. The signal selected by the data voice switching section 14 is converted to radio modulated carrier wave in a radio section 16 and transmitted to a remote unit or station through an antenna 17. On the other hand, the signal from a remote unit or station is received by the antenna 17, demodulated into the baseband signal by the radio section 16 and supplied to the data voice switching section 14. The data signals are always demodulated in the modulator demodulator 13 and sent to the controller 12. The controller 12 then controls the data voice switching section 14 under the conditions also explained hereinafter so that in the case of voice, connection is made to the tranceiver 15, and in the case of data, decoding is made by the controller 12 to send its outputs to an information output means 18 comprising a display, a printer, etc. In this connection, it is to be noted that although Fig. 2 shows an embodiment employing a subcarrier modulation system, similar result can be obtained by employing a direct modulation system to effect the modulation into the radio carrier waves direct by the data. Fig. 3 illustrates state transition diagram at the terminal units. First, power on operation permits start of a talk mode. In this talk mode, it is so arranged that the transmission of either of voice or data can freely be made. Usually the operation is made in this talk mode and upon receipt of a polling signal from the central station, the state moves to a polling mode. The meaning of the term polling signal used herein is not limited only to the polling signal addressed to one specific terminal unit, but covers all of the polling signals carried by the same channel, say in the example of the below mentioned signal format, all the signals having a polling command as their commands. In the polling mode, it is so arranged that any free transmission of voice and data is inhibited, but only during the polling addressed to one specific terminal unit, its own data can be transmitted. This is to avoid any destruction of data by collision. The release of the polling mode usually is effected in either of two manners, one is the reception of a polling completion signal from the central station and the other is the time over, that is, the absence of the polling signal within a predetermined period of time. According to the present invention, however, another function, that is, a compulsory release function of the polling mode is specifically provided for any interruption talk. Namely, by pushing an interruption button or by generating a control signal, the state goes to the wait of interruption acceptance signal. It is so arranged that even in this state, usual polling function is maintained. Upon receipt of an interruption acceptance signal from the central station, an interruption signal is transmitted and the state returns to the talk mode. Fig. 4 illustrates a state transition diagram at the central station. Similarly to the terminal units, power on operation permits start of a talk mode and usually the operation proceeds in this mode. In the talk mode, free talking is possible and when the data from terminal units are received, a response signal will be sent back. The transition to a polling mode is manually started or automatically started by means of a timer, etc. In the polling mode, the polling of the terminal units is carried out sequentially and, during such polling operation, interruption acceptance signals are transmitted to the terminal units at fixed or unfixed time intervals and the state moves to the wait of interruption signals from the terminal units. In the wait of interruption signals state, any reception of interruption signals within a predetermined period of time causes transmission of a polling completion signal or the like to return to the talk mode, but if no interruption signals are received within the period, the state returns to the polling mode and the polling continues. Upon completion of the polling of the necessary number of the terminal units, the state returns to the talk mode. At such time, a polling completion signal may either be generated or not. Fig. 5 shows an example of a timing chart of the central station. As soon as the polling is started, the terminal units are sequentially polled. In this example, five terminal units are polled and, at the time of completing the polling of them, an interruption acceptance signal X is transmitted and subsequently interruption signal reception time slots or empty time slots Y are given. A plurality of these time slots are given for reducing any collision of signals when two or more terminal units request interrupts at the same time. By random selection of these time slots, such reduction can be made. Upon finish of the interruption time slots, the polling of the following units is started. Thus, after completion of polling all the units, the state returns to the talk mode. Fig. 6 shows an example of a timing chart of the system, wherein an interruption is made. As mentioned hereinbefore, usually the state stands in a talk mode. Referring also to Fig. 2, upon start of the polling, polling signals are transmitted from the central station 3 as shown by A to C. In response thereto, the necessary data are transmitted from the terminal units 1₁ and 1₂ as response signals Now it is assumed that an interruption button is pushed in the terminal unit 1₂. Then the state goes to the wait of an interruption acceptance signal from the central station 3. The central station 3 discontinues the polling after an appropriate time interval and transmits an interruption acceptance signal X and further continuously gives an appropriate number of interruption signal reception time slots Y. The terminal unit 1₂, after receiving the interruption acceptance signal X, selects at random one of the interruption signal reception time slots Y and transmits an interruption signal x. The central station 3, upon receipt of the interruption signal Fig. 7 shows an example of a signal format. In this Fig. 7, bit synchronization signal is a preamble for stabilizing the system. The frame synchronization signal indicates a head of the frame and means that the data will follow thereafter. The data portion is constituted by various informations. Its command portion discriminates polling signals, response signals, interruption acceptance signals, interruption signals, polling completion signals, etc. The individual numbers to follow are the identification numbers to be alloted to the terminal units and the central station. The data portion is constituted also by other various informations. As described above, the present invention also provides a method of operating a communication system capable of interruption talk during data transmission by polling process between terminal units and a central station. The central station has the functions of The plural terminal units have the functions of As it is understood from the above explanation, the interruption talk system of the present invention enables interruption talk even during the polling. Namely, it enables to realize the data transmission by the polling process in the same channel as that of the talking.
