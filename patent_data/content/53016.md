## Description
TITIE BAT RERUNING This invention relates to purification of sal fat. The tree Shores robusta of India is related botanically to S. stenopters, the source of Borneo tallow, and yields a vegetable fat similar in its chemical constitution and physical properties. Like Borneo tallow, the fat of S. robusta, known as sal fat, is prized particularly for its sharp melting characteristics in the region of body temperature and is used as a constituent in commercially valuable edible and non edible formulations. Th the manufacture of cocoa butter substitutes there is a need for fat containing the specific 2 oleyl disaturated triglycerides, principally of palmitic and or stearic acid.Sal fat is among the few vegetable fat sources rich in these components, especially the stearine fractions of the fate Thus, on acetone fractionation a solid stearine can be obtained from sal fat in 50 70 yield which contains approximately 80 SOS glyceride, depending upon the quality of the fat. Apart from having light colour, a critical feature of fats for the uses described above is their melting behaviour. This may be examined by determination of the dilatations of the fat by standard procedures. It has been found that a good sample of sal fat will show a D30 value 1000 1500 and D35 value 50 300, indicating a steep melting behaviour. On the other hand, samples which melt no less steeply may still be inferior and unsatisfactory because they melt at substantially lower temperatures. The inferior melting characteristics described are frequently not attributable to substantial differences in the triglyceride composition of the fats and cannot be effectively improved by the usual fat refining techniques or by careful fractionationO The present invention is based upon the discovery that the inferior melting behaviour in such cases is attributable tD the presence in the fat of comparatively small quantities of minor constituents, which are mainly oxidised compounds and of other partial glycerides. These may be removed to provide a marked improvement in the melting characteristics of the fat.Two of these constituents have been characterised as a triglyceride containing 2 moles of saturated fatty acid and one mole of 9 10 epoxy stearic acid conveniently referred to as Factor P , and another variety of triglyceride containing 2 moles of saturated fatty acid and one mole of 9, 10 dihydroxy stearic acid conveniently referred to as Factor SQ O There may also be other transformation products of these and other constituents. e present invention therefore concerns a process for improvement of the quality of sal fat in terms of dilatation as well as colour by preferential removal of substantial quantities of these minor consti tents together with colouring matter comoounds. According to this invention there is provided a process for the purification of sal fat to remove, at least partially, the minor constituents which are responsible for its inferior melting behaviour, together with the colouring compounds, by physical adsorption by contacting sal fat with a specially developed co gelled silica alumina adsorbent. Other fats, especally those used in chocolate, may similarly be purified. The contacting of sal fat with the silica alumina adsorbent for removal of the desired constituents is conveniently done in the lisuid phase and for this the sal fat is first mixed with an organic solvent, preferably a volatile organic solvent like hexane or benzene. The concentration of sal fat in the organic solvent is between 5 and 60 per cent by weight of the solution but preferably it is between 5 to 30 per cent by weight. The treatment is done advantageously at temperature below the boiling point of the solvent used eg 10 30 C. ffe co gelled silica alumina adsorbent may be dispersed in a solution of the sal fat and after treatment the adsorbent recovered by filtration. Th.en the adsorbent is dispersed in a solution of Sal fat in organic solvent, the adsorbent is preferably used in amounts of 0.3 to 3 parts by weight per part of the sal fat content in the solution. Alternatively, the sal fat solution is passed through a bed of the co gelled silica alumina adsorbent. The adsorbent may be regenerated by desorption using a solvent which is more polar than the solvent used for making the sal fat solution. The co gelled silica alumina adsorbent is advantageously pre activated before contacting with the sal fat. The activation of the co gelled silica alumina adsorbent is carried out by heating the material at elevated temperatures like 100 500 C, but preferably at 100 C 200 C for sufficient time ca. 4 hours to drive away the water. The silica alumina adsorbent is prepared by cogelling silica and alumina by adding an acidic solution containing aluminium ions to a silicate solution. The amounts of reactants and their concentrations will be selected to give an adsorbent with an alumina content between 0.1 and 25 , preferably up to 13 and more preferably between 0.5 and 9 . A suitable source of aluminium ions is a solution of aluminium sulphate in dilute sulphuric acid0 Usually sodium silicate will be used. The final pH is adjusted to 7, after which the hydrogen of silica alumina is aged for 2 hours before it is washed free of sulphate ions.Any residual sodium ion may be optionally removed by exchanging with aininonium ci ftoride solution The hydrogen is ten dried at 1000C and the dried gel i.e. the co gelled silica alumina is activated at the desired temperature and finally crushed to the required particle size of 100 mesh, The sequence of addition of ingredients is very important for the preparation of an efficient silica alumina adsorbent. A better adsorbent is obtained by adding aluminium sulphate solution to sodium silicate solution. This is illustrated in Example 8. We have studied the behaviour of sal fat by Comparing the performance of co gelled silica alumina adsorbent with the commonly known adsorbent silica gel, It has been found that co gelled silica alumina adsorbent is superior to silica gel in that the colouring matter compounds are removed beer with silica alumina than with silica gel, although Factors 1F and Q are removed to more or less the same extent with botch adsorbensPartial glycerides are also largely removed the Process. The silica alumina adsorbent can be roused. a number of times for treating fresh batches of sal fat, after desorption by G more polar solvent such as ether, ether methanol, or hexane isopropanol or any other mixture of solvents known in the art of increasing of the polarity of hexane, followed by activation of the silica alumina adsorbent at 70 to 20000 for about 1 hour. The amount Of the undesirable minor constituents present may be determined by subjects the sal fat or the stearine to Thin Layer Chromatrography TLC and isolating and weighting the fractions of substrate produced.The method has been described by Belvadi V. K., KamatP.L., Metha D.T., Bhaskar Anil and Bringi, N. V., J. CilTechnologists Assoc., India, 1979, 11, 3. The invention will now be more fully explained with reference to the accompanying examples wherein we have studied the behaviours of both silica gel and the new co gelled silica alamina. Examples 1 and 2 relate to the use of common silica gel and other examples relate to the use of the new co gelled silica alumina adsorbent prepared as described and used at room temperature R ie 20 30 C.Example 1 The experiment was done with a sample of raw sal fat FFA, 3.2 which has been stored for about 2 years in the laboratory. A solution of raw sal fat 20 g in hexane 100 ml was stirred for 2 hours at room temperature RT 26 C with 2 different proportions of chromatographic grade silica gel previously activated at 1200 for 30 minutes , namely 1 0.375 and 7 1. The slurry was filtered and silica gel washed with 100 ml hexane and the combined filtrate was evaporated to obtain the improved sal fat.The dilatation characteristics of the fat before and after the treatment are shown below Dilatations Dilatations of improved of raw sal sal fat fat 1 0.375 1 1D20 900 1610 1825 D30 225 1410 1600D35 50 370 GllO The improved fat was recovered in a yield ul 90 illun tho t c t pi1c a L ol ratio WL I 0.375 and 10 yield when fat silica gel ratio was Example 2 The solution of raw sal fat of the quality des cribed in Example 1 25 g in hexane 150 ml was stirred magnetic stirrer with chromatographic grade silica gel 25 g for 2 hours at R.T.The adsorbent was filtered and the filtrate is distilled to obtain tne improved fat0 The once used silica gel was stirred. with hexane isopropanol azeotrope 78 22 v v 150 ml for 2 hours at R.T. and this regeneration step as repeated 4 tines to remove adsorbed compounds and colour and finally with hexane 150 ml alone to remove isopropanol. The regenerated silica gel was used a second time and a similar procedure was followed for third and subsequent uses after activation at 1200 for 2 hour.In this particular experiment silica gel was used 10 times and dilation characteristics of the proved fat are recorded below Number of reuse Di Dilations of improved fat 20 D30 D35 1 1750 1500 Mike 6 1800 1500 500 8 1750 1510 425 10 1730 1480 400 The average yield of improved fat in above experiments was 80 . It is seen that the quality of sal fat in terms of dilatations has improved from a stating of or 225 to about 1,500. The Lovibond colour of the pooled sample from the ten experiments was 32.5 in 1 4 cell. Example 3 A solution of raw sal fat of the quality described in Example 1 25 g , in hexane 150 Al was stirred for 2 hours at R.T. with co gelled silica aluminapre activated at 5000C 25 g . The adsorbent was filtered and the filtrate was distilled to obtain the improved fat. The adsorbent was reused five tines after desorption and activation as described in Example 2. The dilatations are recorded below Number of uses Dilatations of improved fat D20 D30 D 1 1730 1500 400 2 1680 1450 300 5 4 1660 1440 300 5 1670 1410 280 The colour of the pooled sample was 11 in 41, cell. The average yield of the improved fat in above experiments was 78 .Example 4 Raw sal fat of the quality described in Example 1, was refined by 3 N NaOH and brine, and the refined fat dissolved in hexane, 1 5, w v was bleached with 6 active earth and 1 carbon. The characteristics of the refined, bleached fat were as follows Colour 27.9 Y 0.9 R in cell D20 1450 D30 1280 35 180 Factor P 4 Factor Q 5 A solution of the above fat 25 g in hexane 150 ml was stirred with co gelled silica alumina preactivated at 5000C, 25 g for 2 hours at R.T. In another experiment silica gel was used in place of the silica alumina adsorbent.The characteristics of the improved fat are shown below Characteristics Silica Gel Co gelled silica alumina adsorbentColour 30 6 Y 5R in 1 2 Cell 27.9 Y 0.4 R 4 Y 0.4 R Factor P 1.1 1.1Factor Q Nil NilD20 1680 1700D30 1430 1520D35 30 430 The effectiveness of silica alumina adsorbent in improving the colour is quite evident. factor Q is completely removed by both the adsorbents while factor P is removed only partially. Both the adsorbents are largely similar in improving the dilatations.Example 5 A sample o raw sal fat 500 g from 1977 crop FFA 11 dissolved in hexane 2 lit was stirred with 6 earth 30 g and 1 , carbon 5 g for 1 hour at RT at the boiling point of hexane. This fat 100 g was dissolved in hexane 500 ml and stirred with preactivated co gelled silica alumina adsorbent, was filtered and filtrate was distilled to get the improved fat. The adsorbent was used five times after desorption and activation as described in Example 2. The pooled sample FFA, 6.4 was refined with 7N Na0CO3 and the characteristics of the refined fat are shown below Characteristics D20 1720 D30 1430 120 Factor P 1 Factor Q Nil Diglycerides 2 For comparison, the raw sal fat was refined byNa2CO3 and its characteristics are shown below D20 1420 D30 1140 D35 60 Factor P 1 Factor Q 2.5 Diglycerides 7.7 These data reveal that the quality of sal fat with high FFA is also improved by silica alumina treatment. The diglycerides content is reduced to 2 . Like in previous example Factor Q is also removed completely. Example 6 Solutions of miscella bleached raw sal fat 100 g in hexane 500 ml were stirred for hour at room temperature with silica alumina adsorbent A iee activated at 5000C and silica alumina adsorbent B i.e. activated at 18000 100 g respectively. Other steps of recovery of upgraded fat, regeneration and reactivation of adsorbent for subsequent reuses are the same as described in previous examples. Each experiment consisted of 5 cycles and upgraded fats from second to fifth cycles were pooled for analysis and refining studies. The yields and characteristics of the upgraded fats are shown in the following table 1977 Fat 1978 FatCharacter After After istics Before sorption ore absorption ption.

A similar experiment with silica alumina adsorbent activated at 1200C gave results comparable toAdsorbent B . Example 7 Three different samples of silica alumina adsorbent were prepared according to procedure described on p.4 commat 5 with activation temperature at 120 C, with different amounts of alumina so that final composition of the co gelled adsorbent contained 5, 9, and 25 alumina. Their efficiency for removal of diglycerides from sal fat were examined by passing the sal fat hexane miscella 600 g of 20 solution of the fat in hexane at RT through columns of adsorbent 100 g in turn and the effluent streams ere analysed for their diglyceride.content. The columns were 1 inch diameter and the feed rate 1.5cc minute.

Example 8 In addition to method of preparation, this example illustrates the importance of sequence of addition of ingredients for producing a more efficient silica alumina adsorbent. For the sake of convenience, the seauence where aluminium sulphate is added to sodium silicate the resultant adsorbent has been termed as X , whereas in the case where the sodium silicate is added to aluminium sulphate the adsorbent so obtained has been termed as Preparation of Silica Alumina To a solution of 0.54 kg neutral sodium silicate in 3.4 kg water, was added a solution of O.CF kg of aluminium in sulphate in dilute sulphuric acid 0.03 kg H2S04 in 0.3 kg H20 . The pH at the end of addition was adjusted to 7.0. The hydrogel was aged for 2 hours and it was washed free of sodium sulphate. The residual sodium ions were further removed by addition of ammonium chloride solution 5 and subsequent filtration. The material was dried at 1200C and was activated at 500 0C before use. Preparation of Silica Alimina The sample was prepared exactly as above except that the sodium silicate solution was added to the solution of aluminium sulphate in sulphuric acid.
