## Description
HELICHROMIC COMPOUNDS AND DISPLAYS Technical Field The present invention relates to liquid crystal compositions and liquid crystal display devices. Unique helichromic11 compounds possessing both chromophoric and helical ordering characteristics when used in combination with nematic liquid crystals are disclosed. Background Art Liquid crystal display technology has become prominent in recent years due primarily to the popularity of digital displays for a variety of information display functions. Of particular note are the use of such displays in hand held calculators and digital watches. While there are several types of liquid crystal displays in use, a particularly advantageous display for certain high performance applications is known as the phase change display. This type of display has been described in the literature, e.g. D. L. White and G. N.Taylor, New Absorptive Mode Reflective Liquid CrystalDisplay Device , Journal of Applied Physics, Vol. 45, pp.4718 4723, 1974 . Briefly, these devices comprise a typical transmissive or reflective liquid crystal display cell having appropriate front and back electrode patterns and features a homogeneously or homoetropically oriented liquid crystal layer comprising host positive nematic liquid crystal, a guest dichroic dye, and an optically active additive in amounts sufficient to provide a cholesteric liquid crystal phase. In the absence of an electric field across the display electrodes, the dichroic dye is oriented to absorb a substantial amount, e.g. 95 , of the unpolarized incident light and the display area exhibits a color characteristic of the dichroic dye.When an electric field is applied to the desired electrode, the liquid crystal layer in register with the electrode is caused to change from a cholesteric phase to a nematic phase in homeotropic alignment due to the positive dielectric anisotropy of the liquid crystal host material.In this state, the dichroic dye in the liquid crystal layer is oriented to absorb relatively little incident light and a clear area, corresponding to the electrode area on a colored background, is observed. By selective activation of the electrodes, information can be readily displayed. Due to its operating mechanism, the phase change display does not require the use of auxiliary polarizers as do other well known types of displays, e.g.nematic and guest host nematic displays. However, the phase change displays have a number of inherent disadvantages. One significant negative performance characteristic is the so called storage effect or after image scattering observed when the display is switched from a field on to a field off state. Following this transition, the image previously displayed does not immediately disappear, but remains for several seconds or more as a milky pattern which scatters light and may render the displayed information ambiguous, particularly where rapid switching such as in multiplexing, is required. Further, significant amounts, e.g. 5 158 by weight, of the optically active and dichroic additives must be incorporated into the liquid crystal mixture.These foreign additives are typically chemically and or photochemically unstable in liquid crystal display systems and their addition introduces a potential source of harmful decomposition products into the display. In addition, all the optically active additives of the prior art are nematic liquid crystals and it is well known that liquid crystal systems comprising chemically dissimilar mixtures of liquid crystals have properties which vary nonlinearly and unpredictably with composition and temperature. Thus, typical phase change liquid crystal mixtures may have properties such as optical anisotropy, phase transition temperature, and electric, magnetic and elastic properties which vary unpredictably. Disclosure of Invention The present invention relates to helichromic liquid crystal displays which require no auxiliary polarizers, exhibit rapid decay and no after image scattering and require significantly reduced additives to obtain such performance. The superior display devices of the present invention can be provided by the use of unique helichromic compounds in admixture with nematic liquid crystals. More specifically, the helichromic compounds of the present invention are organic, nonionic compounds, soluble in nematic liquid crystal compositions, which compounds possess both helical ordering characteristics and chromophoric characteristics when used in combination with nematic liquid crystals. As used herein, the term helichromic may be used to refer to the described helichromic compounds to liquid crystal compositions containing such compounds and also to display devices containing the compounds of the present invention. The helichromic compounds of the present invention are characterized by having a chromophoric moiety and a helical ordering moiety in a single molecule.As used in this application, the term helical ordering moiety or helical ordering group refers to substituents which impart to the helichromic compound helical ordering characteristics such that liquid crystal mixtures in which effective amounts of the helichromic compounds are included will exhibit helical ordering characteristics. The helichromic displays of the present invention provide increased efficiency when compared with conventional phase change displays since they operate effectively at lower voltages while exhibiting similar brightness, contrast and speed. The helichromic compounds of this invention also find use as components of twist nematic and guest host nematic liquid crystal displays to eliminate optical bounce in a surprisingly efficient manner as will be discussed hereinafter. Brief Description Of The Drawings Figures 1 and 2 are graphic presentations comparing performance characteristics of the helichromic displays of the present invention with prior art display devices. Detailed Description The helichromic displays of the present invention derive their superior performance properties from the use of unique helichromic compounds. The helichromic compounds of the present invention are novel, organic, non ionic compounds which are soluble in nematic liquid crystal compositions and which comprise at least one chromophoric moiety and at least one helical ordering moiety in a single molecule. The chromophoric moieties or groups useful in this invention must be capable of absorbing at least some wavelength of incident electromagnetic radiation, in the visible wavelengths. The useful chromophoric groups are dichroic groups, i.e. groups which have light absorption properties which vary depending on the alignment of the molecule with respect to the vibration mode of incident light, and which are capable of being aligned by nematic liquid crystals. Useful dichroic groups must be capable of being joined with helical ordering moieties and the resulting helichromic molecule must be dichroic in nature and have the ability to be aligned by liquid crystal materials. Exemplary dichroic groups are groups which are characteristic of the well known azo, azo stilbene, benzothiazolylpolyazo, azo methine, methine, merocyanine, anthraquinone, and methine arylidene families of dyes. Suitable helical ordering moieties or groups are those groups which impart helical ordering characteristics to the helichromic compound as discussed hereinabove. The useful groups must cause the liquid crystal mixture in which the helichromic compound is included, to have a positive or negative helical ordering characteristic of less than infinite pitch when the helichromic compound is present in concentrations at or below its solubility limits. The conditions required to induce optical rotation generally follow the rule of Brewster Brewster, J., J.A.C.S., 81, 5475, 5483 and 5493 1959 , and involve the presence of a chiral group, e.g. one having an asymmetric carbon atom. Preferred helical ordering groups include 2 methyl and 3 methyl alkyl groups citronellyl, camphanyl, 3 methyl cyclohexyl, a methyl benzyl, and the like.They are particularly preferred if in the form. Preferred helichromic compunds of the present invention can be represented by the general formula Q Z n wherein Q is a dichroic group, Z is a helical ordering group and n is an integer having a value of one or more and is preferably an integer from 1 to 4. As noted above, preferred dichroic groups, Q, are groups which are characteristic of the aao, azo stilbene, benzothiazolylpolyazo, azo methine, methine, merocyanine, anthraquinone and methine arylidene families of dyes which are per se well known in the art and which will be described in greater detail hereinafter.Preferred helical ordering groups, Z, are organic groups containing an asymmetric carbon atom such as the 2 methyl alkyl and 3 methyl alkyl groups wherein alkyl is preferably a lower alkyl of 2 to about 8 carbon atoms, citronellyl, camphanyl, 3 methyl cyclohexyl, and a methylbenzyl. The number, n, of helical ordering groups, Z, which can be substituted on the chromophoric group, Q, is dependent on the number and position of reactive sites available on the dye from which Q is derived. For example, when Q is an azo, azo stilbene, benzothiazolyl polyazo, merocyanine, azo methine based, methine, or methine arylidene group, n is preferably 1 or 2 and the helical ordering group, Z, is substituted in a position along the long axis of O so as not to significantly decrease its effectiveness as a dichroic dye. When O is an anthraquinone based group, the anthraquinone skeleton is normally substituted in one or more of the 1, 4, 5 and 8 positions with helical ordering groups.However, when the anthraquinone is substituted with two NH2 groups in either the 1 and 4, or 5 and 8 positions, the 2 and 3, or 6 and 7, positions of the anthraquinone skeleton, respectively, may be substituted with a cyclic dicarboximide group having a helical ordering group attached to the nitrogen. Other ballasting or auxochromic groups which may affect the order parameter or absorption band of the chromophoric moiety are permitted substituents in the remainder of the available positions as is known in the art. The preparation and structure of preferred helichromic compounds will be discussed in greater detail hereinafter. The helichromic compounds of the present invention can be combined with, and are soluble in, nematic liquid crystal compositions which are per se known in the art. The nematic liquid crystals can have either a positive or negative dielectric anisotropy. Generally liquid crytals having higher absolute values of dielectric constant are preferred. At this time the positive nematic materials having high dielectric constants are more readily available and for convenience are referred to for purposes of illustration herein. Mixtures of positive and negative materials are also useful, particularly those mixtures having a net positive dielectric anisotropy. As used herein the term positive or negative refers to the net dielectric anisotropy where mixtures are used. Eutectic mixtures are also useful. Illustrative are eutectic mixtures of 4 substituted 4 cyanobiphenyls wherein the 4 substituents are alkyl or alkoxy of 3 to 8 carbon atoms. Representative is the commercially available E 7 mixture from B.D.H. Ltd. Representative of nematic liquid crystals having negative dielectric anisotropy which would be useful in the present invention is the liquid crystal EN 18 developed by Chisso Corporation. Helichromic devices of the present invention are similar to liquid crystal display devices of the prior art in that they comprise two plates of glass of nominal thickness spaced from a few microns to a few tens of microns apart in a parallel configuration. The inner surfaces of each glass plate are coated with a thin film of for example, indium tin oxide to form a conductive electrode surface. The electrode pattern which is desired may be produced by silk screen or photolithographic techniques which are well known in the art. The surfaces of each inwardly facing electrode pattern are treated using techniques known in the art to insure that the helichromic liquid crystal mixture is homeogeneously or homeotropically oriented. Homeotropic alignment is preferred, i.e., that the molecules are aligned perpendicular to the electrode surfaces.The helichromic displays of the present invention, in the absence of an electric field, propagate unpolarized light through two elliptical modes, which result in the absorption of both vectors of light and the transmission of the characteristic color of the helichromic compound. In the presence of an electric field selectively applied across electrodes the helichromic and liquid crystal molecules between the electrodes change from a helically ordered phase to a nematic phase in homeotropic alignment, and minimum absorption of light is observed. Thus, liquid crystal displays containing a sufficient concentration of the helichromic compounds alternate between a helichromiccompound colored state and a clear state, between the electrodes, when in the on and off state respectively.A plurality of helichromic compounds may be used to produce a display which appears black in the absence of an electric field, i.e., essentially all visible wavelengths of light are absorbed equally, and transparent in the presence of an electric field, i.e., all the dyes exhibiting minimum absorption. It is a characteristic of the helichromic devices of the present invention that no auxiliary polarizer is required. Thus, these helichromic devices have brightness characteristics equivalent to phase change displays and superior to twist nematic liquid crystal devices, which require two polarizers, or guest host liquid crystal devices which require one auxiliary polarizer. In addition, the helichromic devices of the present invention display rapid decay times, i.e., no after image scattering, and may be operated at voltages lower than those required to operate traditional phase change devices. As discussed hereinabove, the preferred helichromic compounds of the present invention can be represented by the general formula Q Z n wherein Q is preferably a dichroic azo, azo stilbene, benzothiazolyl polyazo, merocyanine, azo methine, methine, methine arylidene or anthraquinone group, Z is a helical ordering moiety and n is an integer having a value of one or more and is preferably from l to 4. The helical ordering moiety Z, may be linked to the dichroic moiety Q by organic linking groups. Preferred linking groups include CH N , CH CH , N N , NH , N alk , O , S , CH2 p , C CH3 2 ,EMI8.1 C6H10 , phenyl, naphthyl groups, cyclic dicarboximide groups, and combinations thereof, wherein p is 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. The dichroic moiety Q may be substituted in a number of available positions with one or more additional ballasting groups. Exemplary ballasting groups includeNH2, CH2 pCH3, O CH2 pCH3, CH CH3 2, EMI9.1 C6Hll, phenyl groups, naphthyl groups, and combinations thereof, wherein p is l, 2, 3, or 4. In addition, Q may be substituted in any available position on any aromatic ring by small side groups which influence color absorption and solubility of the helichromic compound. Exemplary of such side groups are lower alkyl groups, lower alkoxy groups, F, Cl, Br,NO2, NH alk , N alk 2, OH, CN, CF3 and CH3. Exemplary dichroic groups of the azo and benzothiazolyl polyazo types include the following EMI9.2 EMI10.1 R lower alkyl C1 C4 EMI10.2 EMI11.1 Exemplary dichroic groups of the azo stilbene type include the following EMI11.2 Exemplary dichroic groups of the azo methine type include the following EMI11.3 Exemplary dichroic groups of the methine type include the following EMI12.1 Exemplary dichroic groups of the methine arylidene type include the following EMI12.2 R CH3, C2H5, etc. Exemplary dichroic groups of the merocyanine type include EMI13.1 n 1, 2 or 3. Exemplary dichroic groups of the anthraquinone type include the following EMI13.2 EMI14.1 The helichromic azo and azo stilbene dyes of this invention may be synthesized using methods of diazotization normally employed to synthesize other azo and azo stilbene dyes. The literature abounds with methods of diazotization and specific organic synthetic procedures relating to diazotization and coupling reaction schemes. Helichromic azo and azo stilbene type dyes may be synthesized by direct diazotization of the chiral aniline. Preferred optically active anilines have a para substituted 2 methylbutyl group, 3 methyl butyl group, citronellyl group, camphanyl group, 3 methyl cyclohexyl group, or a methyl benzyl group. However, other useful chiral anilines may have the optically active group in the ortho or meta ring positions.Additional substituents, other than amino groups, may be present on the ring such as methyl, nitro, cyano, and hydroxy groups. The preparation of p amino 2 methylbutylbenzene, i.e., chiral aniline, is shown in D. Dolphin and Z. Muljiani, Journal of Chemical Physics, Vol. 58 2 , 414 1973 . Alternatively the nitroso derivative of the chiral aniline may be utilized to synthesize azo type helichromic dyes by coupling with an amino compound. Diazotization using alkali metal nitrite in mineral acid or using nitrosylsulfuric acid is also effective in the practice of the present invention, and those skilled in the art and science of synthetic chemistry will appreciate the various techniques involved. Helichromic polyazo dyes may be synthesized by sequential diazotization and coupling. Reference is made to U.S. 4,145,114, for detailed procedures. Other pertinent references include U.S. 4,032,219 4,029,392 4,027,950 and 4,116,861. Helichromic polyazo dyes may also be synthesized by tetraazotization of a polyaryl diamine and subsequent coupling with a chiral nitroso benzene group. Helichromic polyazo dyes having more than one chiral group may be obtained by reacting a helichromic azo compound with a chiral nitroso compound, obtained by oxidation of the corresponding chiral aryl amine with caros acid the procedure is taught in Hickenbottom,Organic Synthetic Chemistry, Vol. II, p. 310 1956 , in a minimum quantity of glacial acetic acid. Helichromic benzothiazolyl polyazo dyes may be obtained by converting benzothiazolyl amines to the corresponding diazotate by the use of organic alkyl nitrites. The diazotate is then coupled to an aniline in weak acid and the benzothiazolyl azoaniline dye intermediate is recovered. Further diazotization and coupling to chiral anilines yields helichromic compounds. Particularly preferred benzothiazolyl polyazo dye precursors are disclosed in Applicant s copending patent application U.S.Serial No. 216,010. Helichromic dyes of the methine type may be synthesized by combining equivalent molar amounts a chiral aniline and an aromatic aldehyde which may also have a chiral substituent condensing in acetic acid, and heating. Helichromic dyes of the azo methine type may be synthesized by several methods known to those skilled in the art. Usually such methods involve synthesis of 4 2 methylbutyl benzaldehyde followed by condensation with various amino azo dye intermediate to produce a chiral azo methine dye. Helichromic dyes of the merocyanine type may be prepared by known methods of reacting a merocyanine dye precursor using a chiral halide. Exemplary merocyanine dye precursors are described in The Chemistry of SyntheticDyes, Monograph No. 127, pages 249 254 1955 . Helichromic dyes of the methine arylidene type are synthesized as shown in U.S. Patent No. 4,033,948, incorporated herein by reference. Helichromic anthraquinone type dyes useful in the present invention may be synthesized by substituting an optically active amino group onto a dichroic anthraquinone starting compound. Useful dichroic anthraquinones are disclosed in Applicant s copending patent applicationU.S. Serial No. 70,421, in U.S. 3,960,750, and in U.S.3,960,751. It is known that anthraquinones substituted with certain arylamino, heterothio, arylthio, or aminoalkyl groups are dichroic. Helichromic anthraquinone dicarboximide type dyes may be synthesized by cyclizing the anthraquinone dicarboxylic acid or anhydride with a chiral amine at high temperatures, i.e., greater than 1500C, and high pressures, i.e., greater than about 10 atmospheres. Particularly preferred helichromic compounds of he present invention include the following EMI17.1 EMI18.1 EMI19.1 EMI20.1 EMI21.1 EMI22.1 EMI23.1 It is believed that the helichromic compound must be present in the helichromic displays in a quantity sufficient to induce a pitch to the helically ordered mixture which is effective to assure that incident unpolarized light is propagated through two elliptical modes, and that both vectors of light are absorbed. The amount of helichromic compound required to induce such a pitch is dependent upon the size of the helichromic compound and the number of helical ordering sites. A longer helichromic molecule will result in a twisted helix formation at a lower concentration than will a relatively shorter helichromic molecule.In addition, a helichromic dye molecule having two helical ordering sites will effect the twisted helix formation at a lower concentration than an analogous helichromic molecule having only one helical ordering site. Typically, the quantity of helichromic compound which will assure absorption of both vectors of light is between 1 and 5 percent and preferably 2 and 3 percent by weight of the bulk nematic liquid crystal material. The helichromic compounds of the present invention have, in general, relatively high values of the optical order parameter S. This parameter is a measure of the efficiency with which the compound is oriented by the liquid crystal material and is directly related to the contrast one observes when viewing the device. In general, dyes having high optical order parameters produce displays having high contrasts. The determination of the optical order parameter, S, is discussed in the Journal ofApplied Physics, Vol. 45, No. 11, 4718 23 1974 .EMI24.1 wherein Ao is the absorbance in the absence or an eiectric yield and A1 is tne aDsorDance in tne presence of an electric field. S is a value something less than 1 and preferably is very close to 1.Values ofS greater than 0.5 and preferably greater than 0.65 insure contrasts of between 5 1 and 10 1. The S values and absorption maximum for several of the helichromic compounds of the present invention are shown in Table I.

In addition, since the helichromic dyes of the present invention are not themselves liquid crystalline, they do not substantially alter the thermodynamic properties of the liquid crystal mixture to which they are added, as do traditional optically active additives. Another significant advantage of devices utilizing the helichromic dyes of the present invention is that the liquid crystal material need bye adulterated with relatively less foreign additive, i.e. helichromic compound than do conventional phase change devices, thereby reducing potential sources of device decomposition. In general, substantially more dichroic dye and optically active material must be present in phase change displays to attain equivalent contrast as compared to displays containing only between 0.1 and 5 by weight helichromic compound. The helichromic displays of the present invention provide a significantly improved display due, in part, to the elimination of after image scattering. The elimination of after image scattering is illustrated inFig. 2. Referring to Fig. 2, the solid line F represents the optical response of a conventional phase change type liquid crystal display containing E 7 nematic liquid crystal material, 2 percent by weight of a dichroic dye mixture comprising 0.68 by weight 0.66 by weight 0.66 by weightEMI26.1 and 10 percent by weight of the optically active additive, cholesteryl nonanoate. The dotted line G represents the optical response of a display containing the same E 7 nematic liquid crystal material and 2 percent by weight of a mixture of helichromic compounds analogous to the dichroic dye mixture in the phase change device.The helichromic mixture comprises 0.68 by weightEMI27.1 made according to the procedure of Example 29 0.66 by weightEMI27.2 made according to the procedure of Example 27 and 0.66 by weightEMI27.3 Each display was illuminated and subjected to a voltage of 10V at time 0. After 200 milliseconds the voltage across each cell was reduced to 0. The resultant optical response of each cell was traced with an oscilloscope and appears as Fig. 2. The cell containing the helichromic dye exhibited no after image scattering of light approximately 75 milliseconds T 275 ms. after the voltage was eliminated. In comparison the cell containing the dichroic dye and cholesteryl nonanoate continued to show significant after image scattering of light even 700 milliseconds T 900 ms. after the voltage was removed. Thus, Fig. 2 illustrates that phase change displays utilizing the helichromic dyes of the present invention have rapid decay times with no after image scattering as compared to the phase change displays of the prior art.Note that the relative optical contrast in both the on and off states were equivalent for the two displays. By use of the helichromic compounds of the present invention the voltage required to produce a device having an equivalent contrast is less than one half that required with a conventional phase change composition.Table II illustrates the relatively low voltage requirements of helichromic displays. Table II Contrast Voltage Ratio Brightness Required rms Conventional phase 5 1 30 30 change device utilizing 10 cholesterol nonanoate in E 7 .Device utilizing the 5 1 30 7 2 helichromic compound E 7 Fig. 1 illustrates that helichromic displays require less voltage to reach any particular perceived contrast ratio than do conventional phase change compositions. Curves C, D, and E represent the optical response of cells containing 4.5 percent by weight of the dichroic dye mixture used for Fig. 2, and 4, 8 and 12 percent by weight cholesteryl nonanoate, respectively, in E 7 liquid crystal material. Dotted curves A and B represent the optical response of cells containing 1 and 3 percent by weight, respectively, of the mixture of helichromic compounds used for Fig. 2 in E 7 . The voltage required to reach any particular contrast ratio the threshold voltage , is relatively lower for the helichromic devices than for any of the phase change devices.In addition, Fig. 1 illustrates that helichromic displays require less foreign additives than traditional phase change displays to reach any particular perceived contrast ratio. Helichromic compounds of the present invention may be utilized in so called guest host liquid crystal displays, when present in concentrations insufficient to helically order the mixture. The construction of guest host liquid crystal displays is described inApplied Physics Letters, Vol. 13, pages 91 92 1968 . In guesthost devices a host liquid crystal material has its orientation controlled by the application of electrical fields and in turn interacts with guest dichroic dye molecules to induce a cooperative conforming alignment. Guest host type displays in the off state require one polarizer to absorb one polarization of incident light while the guest dichroic material in the display absorbs the other polarization. In the on or bright state the host liquid crystal material, and thus the guest dye molecules, are oriented by the electric field so that the dichroic dye molecules assume their essentially nonabsorbing state. The concentration of helichromic compound required to be present in guest host displays is between about 0.5 and 2 percent by weight of the bulk nematic liquid crystal material. Helichromic compounds are useful in guest host displays not only to provide a dichroic dye moiety which will absorb one polarization of light but are simultaneously useful in these displays to eliminate the well known problem of optical bounce or reverse twist without the use of the optically active doponts utilized in guest host displays of the prior art. Optical bounce is a hydrodynamic effect which hinders the ability of the display to return precisely to the relaxed no image produced state, when the voltage across the display is terminated. This phenomenon is discussed in Ann. Phys., 19, 273 1972 . The helichromic dyes of the present invention may also be utilized in traditional twist nematic liquid crystal displays to eliminate optical bounce and thus reduce the decay time of the device. The construction and operation of twist nematic type displays is well documented in the art, e.g. U.S. 3,918,796. These devices alternate between transmission of light and no transmission of light depending upon whether a voltage is applied across the cell. The contents of a traditional twist nematic cell of the prior art comprises liquid crystalline material and optionally between 1 2 and 3 by weight of an opticallyactive additive which eliminates optical bounce and reduces decay time. The present invention contemplates the use of between about 0.1 and 18 by weight helichromic compound in order to reduce optical bounce and eliminate the need to utilize optically active liquid crystalline additives. The use of helichromic compounds to replace the optically active dopants conventionally used in guest host and twist nematic displays eliminates the problems associated with these additives as discussed hereinabove.In addition, the concentration of helichromic compound required to eliminate.optical bounce is lower than when conventional optically active liquid crystal additives are used, thus additionally reducing possible liquid crystal cell degradation. The following examples illustrate compositions and devices in accordance with the invention. It should be understood that this is done solely by way of example and is intended neither to delineate the scope of the invention nor limit the ambit of the claims. Examples 1 12 describe intermediates useful in the preparation of the helichromic dyes, described in Examples 13 28.

The structure of the helichromic dye was confirmed by Ne Example 28Helichromic l i4 4 methylhexyl phenylazo 4 4 2 methylbutyl benzylidenelnaphthalene EMI56.1 4 4 methylhexyl aniline 18.1 gm , prepared according to Example 10, is added to a solution of 100 ml concentrated hydrochloric acid and 100 ml water. The slurry is stirred, cooled OOC, and diazotized using 6.9 gm sodium nitrite.The clear diazonium solution is then added to a solution of 15.1 gm 4 aminonaphthylene in 50 ml glacial acetic acid. Coupling occurs and the pH is adjusted to 5 by addition of solid sodium acetate trihydrate.The coupled product is recovered by neutralizing the mixture with a solution of 25 sodium hydroxide in water, and collecting the product by filtration. The product 24.7 gm is then dissolved in 100 ml hot ethanol and 17.6 gm 4 2 methylbutyl benzaldehyde, prepared according to Example 5, is added. To this mixture is added 0.1 gm p toluene sulfonic acid and the dye product forms almost immediately. Upon cooling the product is collected by filtration. Chromatography on silica using toluene as eluent affords the helichroic dye. The structure of the dye is confirmed by NMR. Example 29 The reduction in optical bounce and in decay time for twist nematic liquid crystal displays utilizing a helichromic dye of the present invention were demonstrated in the following manner. Twist nematic display cells were asssembled as described in U.S. 3,918,796. Polaroid HN 45 polarizers were fitted to the front and rear surfaces of the cell and a metallic reflector was affixed to the rear surface of one of the polarizers to produce a reflective display. Three fill mixtures were prepared to demonstrate the effect of the helichromic compounds of the present invention. One fill mixture was pure E 7 , a positive nematic liquid crystal material, available from BDH Chemicals, Poole, England.Another fill mixture was E 7 doped with 1 by weight cholesteryl nonanoate. The third mixture was E 7 and 0.5 by weight helichromic l 4 2 methylbutyl anilinoi4 hydroxyanthraquinone. An oscilloscope trace was used to observe the optical rise and decay pattern of cells filled with each of the above mixtures, as a function of time, when the cells were subjected to the following test procedure The filled cell was mounted on an optical bench and a collimated tungsten light source located at an angle of 450 with respect to the cell surface, was focused on the display. An intermittent RMS voltage of 5 volts at 1 kHz was impressed across the electrode surfaces of the cell.The electro optic modulation of each cell was observed via light reflected from the cell to a photometer, SpectraPhysics Co., Princeton, N.J. , fitted with a photopic filter and connected to a time base oscilloscope. In this way the optical contrast and the rise and decay characteristics of each display were determined. The display cell filled with E 7 containing no optically active dopats exhibited a severe optical bounce which caused an extended decay time when the voltage applied across the cell was removed. The display cell filled with 1 by weight cholesteryl nonanoate in E 7 exhibited no detectable optical bounce and a radically reduced decay time, as compared to the cell containing only E 7 . The display filled with 0.5 by weight helichromic l 4 2 methylbutyl anilino 4 hydroxyanthra quinone in E 7 exhibited no detectable optical bounce and a decay time comparable to the cell doped with 1 cholesteryl nonanoate. Example 30 The reduction in decay time for guest host type liquid crystal displays utilizing a helichromic dye of the present invention was illustrated in the following manner Guest host cells were assembled as in Example 29, however, since the cooperatively aligned helichromic compound absorbs one polarization of light, one polarizer was eliminated. Three guest host mixtures were prepared.One mixture was PCH 1132 positive nematic liquid crystal material available from the E.M. Merck Co., and 1 by weight of the pleochroic dye, 1,5 bis 4 butyl anilino anthraquinone. Another mixture was PCH 1132 and 1 by weight of the above dye with 1 by weight of the optically active additive agent CB 15 available from BDH Chemicals, Inc. The third mixture was PCH 1132 containing 1 by weight of the helichromic dye 1,5 bis 4 2 methylbutyl anilino anthraquinone. An oscilloscope trace was used to observe the optical rise and decay pattern as a function of time when each cell was illuminated and subjected to an intermittent electric field as in the procedure of Example 29. The cell containing dye in E 7 exhibited a severe optical bounce and a protracted decay time when the voltage applied across the cell was removed. The cell containing 1 dichroic dye and 1 CB 15 exhibited no detectable optical bounce and sharp decay characteristics. The cell containing 1 helichromic dye exhibited no detectable optical bounce and sharp decay characteristics, similar to the cell containing CB l5 . This example illustrates the effectiveness of the helichromic dyes of the present invention in reducing optical bounce.In addition, in helichromic displays only 1 by weight foreign additive helichromic dye is required to produce a display having the same optical characteristics as a conventional display containing 28 by weight foreign additives dichroic dye plus optically active additive .
