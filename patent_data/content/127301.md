# Improved positive battery plate.

## Abstract
The power characteristics of a lead acid battery are improved by incorporating a dispersion of 1 to 10 by weight of a thermodynamically stable conductivity additive, such as conductive tin oxide coated glass fibers 34 of filamentary glass wool 42 in the positive active layer 32 carried on the grid 30 of the positive plate 16 . Positive plate reversal to below 0.5 V is to be avoided to prevent reduction of the tin oxide by utilizing an oversized, precharged positive paste or by placing a circuit breaker 26 in series between the plates 16, 18 .
