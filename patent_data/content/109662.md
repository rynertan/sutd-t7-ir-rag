# Apparatus for manufacturing a continuous slide fastener stringer.

## Abstract
An apparatus for manufacturing a continuous slide fastener stringer 11 including a row of injection molded coupling elements 13 secured to a stringer tape 12 along a longitudinal edge thereof, includes a pair of fixed and movable mold members 14, 15 through which the stringer tape 12 is fed by a tape advancing means, and a pair of upper and lower tape shifters 24, 25 mounted on the movable mold member 15 for moving the stringer tape 12 between a first position in which a part of the stringer tape 12 lies flatwise on a mold surface 26 of the movable mold member 15 and a second position in which the tape s part is spaced from the mold surface 26 and held out of interfer ence with a feeler 70 projecting from the mold surface 26 of the movable mold member 15 . During the advancing movement of the movable mold member 15 toward the fixed mold 14 and in timed relation to the stringer tape advancing means, the tape shifters 24, 25 are movable with respect to the movable mold member 15 to place the tape s part in the first position.
