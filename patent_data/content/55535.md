## Description
Fluid purification This invention relates to fluid purification and in particular to the removal of trace impurities from fluids to be treated in highly sensitive systems such as catalysis. As described in our US patent 4177252 in relation to the effect of compounds of halogens or sulphur on metallic copper shift catalysts, the chemical reactions by which such trace impurities exert their undesired action are very rapid and occur mainly at external geometric surfaces. Consequently it was proposed to carry out the shift reaction in a fixed catalyst bed having an inlet zone in which the volume to surface ratio of the catalyst pieces is less than in an outlet zone. This was to be provided for by using in the inlet zone catalyst pieces that were smaller than in the outlet zone or were formed with indentations or protrusions or lobes. We have now realised that the inlet zone shapes disclosed in US 4177252 provide a relatively small increase in geometric surface unless a substantially increased pressure drop can be tolerated, and that this constraint can be evaded by use of a suitably structured absorbent material. According to the invention a process for removing trace impurities from a flowing fluid by means of a solid absorbent is characterised in that the absorbent is in a physical form having a geometric surface area per unit pressure drop hereinafter referred to as so value of at least 0.1 expressed in S.I units. For the purposes of the invention the pressure drop is normalised by application of the following expression to the pressure drop P as measured EMI2.1 where AP is in Pa u is the fluid velocity in m sec This is calculated as if the absorbent bed were empty e is the fluid density in kWm3 L is the length of the bed in m. The geometric surface area is to be distinguished from the internal surface area since the rate of trace impurity absorption is determined by diffusion through a surface film of fluid and receives a negligibly small contribution from diffusion into pores, the internal surface area of the absorbent is not involved. The geometric surface area is, for the purposes of the invention expressed per unit volume of a vessel filled with the absorbent. Using units consistent with the pressure drop units its dimensions are m2 m 3, that is, m Consequently the geometric surface area per unit pressure drop is bimensionless, Other self consistent dimensions could be used, if desired, and the limit specified would differ correspondingly. Variously shaped absorbents can be used. In general the shapes include flattened members of thickness under about 2 mm and are non nesting saddles are an example, In an especially useful process the absorbent is in the form of at least one structure having at least one through passage. The effect of the through passage or passages is to decrease the pressure drop for a given geometric surface area.Taking a random packed bed of 3.6 z 5.4 mm squat cylindrical pellets as standard, these have a G P value of 0.06, but the absorbent structures used in the process have a GA value at least 1.7 times, preferably at least 3 times as great 0.2 or more , This improvement is readily attainable using cylindrical rings. A more substantial improvement at least 6fold, to 0.4 0.7 can be obtained by using rings formed with internal webs. The process preferably employs an absorbent in the form of random packed coils or small honeycomb pieces having a GA value of at least 0.6, that is at least 10 times as great as the above standard.In a further preferred form of the process the absorbent is in the form of a monolithic structure, in which event a GA value at least 20 and preferably in the range 30 150 times the above standard is provided that is, at least 1.2 especially 1.8 to 9.0 . Absorbent. shapes can, of course, be used in which less than such possible high surface areas are provided. A still higher G P value, for example 50 200, can be obtained using foraminate sheet metal, for example gauze or expanded metal. Owing to the low or very low pressure drop, the process can be carried out in long beds, having for example a length at least equal to and in the range 1 10 times, its diameter. As a result fluid flow velocities can be high enough to minimise film diffusion limitation and thus ensure effective removal of impurities present in extremely small trace quantities The absorbent can be in the form of a cartridge readily insertable into and removable from a reactor or even from a position in a pipe or a widened region in a pipe. If the above bent is random packed the cartridge includes a perforated containerIf it is in sheet form, the sheets can be held together by tie rods. Among the structures especially suitable are the following 1. rings of diameter in the range 5 20 mm external , length 5 20 mm and thickness 0o5 10 mm when made of ceramic or down to 0003 mm when made of metal or alloy 2. webbed rings of the same diameter and length as the rings but with maximum thickness 5 mm. Similarly incompletely bridged rings such as PAM rings can be used For 1 or 2 split or spiraled rings can be used , 30 coils of wire or strip of thickness in the same ranges as for webbed rings, again depending on whether they are made of ceramic or metal.The outside dimensions are typically in the range 5 20 mm in diameter and 10 100 mm in length 4. small honeycombs having the same diameter and height ranges as the rings and having an open area of at least 30 , especially in the range 50 90 . Iypic 2 ally such honeycombs have 10 100 passages per cm 5. monoliths having an open area of at least 30 , espec ially in the range 50 90 . In a flow process a single monolith occupying the cross sectional area of the vessel can be used or, more conveniently, a set of monolith units can be disposed side by side. The effects of a monolith can be obtained by stacking sheet a parallel to the direction of fluid flow or with suitable perforations transversely or angled to that direction. A particularly suitable monolithic type structure is described in our co pending European application 80302945 published under Serial No. 25308 this has through flow passages angled to the general direction of fluid flow and is spaced from the walls of its containing vessel so as to cause the fluid to flow alternatingly through the passages and through the space between the structure and the walls. Our application describes various structures providing this flowpath, for example slant cell honeycombs of ceramic or metal, stacked profiled plates and co operating per forated plates such as expanded metal sheets. The flow path within the structure can be in a secantial or, in an annular section vessel, can be in a radial com ponent or direction superimposed on the general flow direction. As a further alternative the monolith may be constituted by perforated such as expanded metal sheets not aligned to such through passages 6. gauzes and other woven or non woven masses. These pro vide a very high surface area per unit of pressure drop, but are less generally applicable because they lack rigidity. They can be used in random pack or monolithic form 7. open cell foams. These likewise can be used in random pack or monolithic form. The above mentioned monoliths, such as are provided by expanded metal, in which parallel but interrupted flow paths are present, are especially preferred, since they suffer from film diffusion limitation no more than a random packed bed, yet afford a much lower pressure drop, because form drag is very much less.it is within the scope of the invention to introduce turbulence by providing deflection of flow, as in non aligned expanded metal, especially when film diffusion limitation is serious. This increases pressure drop but an increase by a factor of 4 is sufficient. The structures can be composed of any material that will withstand the conditions of use, Ceramics such as alumina, aluminosilicate, cordierite and spinels and also glasses and glass cernmics are of general applicability. Metals and alloys, especially iron alloys containing one or more of aluminium, chromium or silicon, as described in our co pending European application 80301982 published under Serial No. 21736, are especially suitable, because they can be formed into structures of very high surface area per unit pressure drop and can be readily coated. Among the absorbents that are especially useful areA. chemically active compounds, for example oxides of Cu, Zn, En or Fe, for removing E2S oxides more basic than ZnO, for removing halogen hydracid examples are hydroxides, aluminates and carbonates or alkali metals 0 catalysts, especially of the type from which the trace impurities are to be excluded.Be highly porous absorbents, for example alumina, for removing water ions exchange resins, for removing ions molecular sieves, such as carbon or crystalline zeolites, for removing relatively involatile gases such as normally liquid compounds, gaseous hydrocarbons, vinyl chloride, nitrogen oxides, ammonia, CO2, CO and nitrogen. Such absorbents can adhere directly to the structure or to an intervening coating such as of alumina, chromia or silica.Such an intervening coating can be the product of superficially oxidising a metallic constituent of the structure and or of application as a washcoat or a soluble decomposable compound. In an important embodiment the invention provides a process for reacting carbon monoxide with steam to give carbon dioxide and hydrogen over a copper containing shift catalyst, in which poisoning of the catalyst by traces of compounds of sulphur or chlorine is inhibited by subjecting the reactants to the process of the invention the absorbent can comprise for example a compound more basic than zinc oxide, as broadly disclosed for example in ourUS patents 3922337 and 3943226, or can be a coating on a support of the copper conta ng catalyst or a catalyst modified to contain less copper, as described in our US patent 4177252. In another important embodiment the invention provides a process of purifying from halogen compounds a hydrocarbon feedstock, especially a naphtha or LPG to be subjected to catalytic reaction with steam at under 600 C to give a methane containing gas. This purification process uses as absorbent an oxide more basic than zinc oxide and preferably follows a catalytic hydrogenation step in which at least organic sulphur is converted toH2S and an H2S removal step.The effect of the catalytic hydrotreatment is to convert organic halogen to halogen hydracidO EEE Each of a series of absorbents or structures capable of supporting absorbent was set up in a catalyst bed 275 mm deep, 91 mm in diameter, and subjected to an air flow of 20 m3h 1 at 20 C. The pressure difference P between the inlet and outlet air was measured in Pa and normalized as described above, The gas density was taken as 1.2, assuming atmospheric pressure, and the gas velocity 0.85 m sec .It was also expressed relative to 3.6 x 5.4 mm squat cylindrical pellets taken as standard 100 o The geometric surface of the samples was calculated from the weight of the sample filling the catalyst bed, the average weight of each piece and the dimensions of each piece. In addition, the calculated pressure drop for a stack of randomly oriented sheets of expanded metal of thickness 0o4 mm, with rectangular apertures 30 mm long, strand width 5 mm and strand pitch 3 mm. This was chosen because its area is about the same as cylindrical pellets clearly much finer grades could be used.
