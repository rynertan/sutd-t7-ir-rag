## Description
RAILWAY TRACK SWITCH LUBRICATOR This invention relates to a railway track switch lubricator of the type in which lubricant is periodically ejected through nozzles arranged adjacent the slide surfaces of the switch chairs on which the switch rails slide, by means of a pump connected to the nozzles by a distribution pipework and to a reservoir for the lubricant. Previously proposed switch lubrication systems suffer from various drawbacks and in practice do not work effectively. One reason is that it has not been found possible, to date, suitably to locate the nozzles or jets so that the slide surfaces are properly lubricated without causing other problems. For example, in one proposal shown in British patent specificationNo. 1 013 502, it was suggested to pass the nozzle tube through a hole in the fixed rail so that it could be directed at the chair slide surface from between the fixed and moving rails. However, with modern rail systems the drilling of holes through the web of the track rail has to be avoided wherever possible so as not to weaken the rails. Nozzles located between the track rails, as shown in British patent specification No. 1 165 357, or at the inner end of the chair slide on upstanding tubes which are aimed down on to the chair slide, as shown in British patent specification No. 967 900, generally get in the way of maintenance operations and in any case are in practice masked from the part of the chair slide on the other side of the moving rail from the nozzle. According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a railway track switch lubricator comprising a pump connected to a distribution pipework system for delivering lubricant from a reservoir to delivery points adjacent the slide surfaces of the switch rail chairs, the delivery points comprising for at least some of the chairs at least one nozzle located at or below the level of the chair slide surface and adapted to project lubricant in an initially upward trajectory and so as to land on the slide surface. In this way, the nozzles associated with the switch rail chairs are located low down out of the way, at or below the level of the slide rail, and also they may be attached, e.g. by a holder or by support of the supply pipe, directly to the sleepers. The nozzle in each case may be located so that it will actually be underneath the switch rail in one lateral position of the latter.For this arrangement, the timing of the lubricant emissidn may be arranged such that the switch rail has already moved aside from being directly above the nozzle at the instant when the lubricant is delivered so that the switch rail does not mask the trajectory path or alternatively, delivery of lubricant can be commenced as soon as the switch rail begins to move sideways so that an initial amount of lubricant will actually hit the underneath of the switch rail before it has moved clear of the trajectory path this is not a disadvantage because the initial amount of lubricant will serve to lubricate the bearing surfaces from underneath the switch rail along the edge of the chair slide. Nozzles located in this way, at or below the level of the chair slide, cannot interfere with or be fouled by the switch rail and yet can be sited very close to the slide surface so that the delivery from the nozzles can be aimed accurately without undue problems of alignment error as occurs with nozzles located more distantly requiring the lubricant to travel on a longer trajectory. Another problem for switch lubrication is that it has so far not proved possible adequately to apply lubricant over the entire slide surface since particularly near the free, blade ends of the switch rails, where the transverse switching movement is greatest, the lateral extent of each chair slide surface is considerable, and in the two operating positions of the switch rail, one end region of the slide surface or the other is inaccessible being underneath the switch rail. According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided in a railway track switch lubricator, for each switch rail chair slide at least two nozzles which are arranged spaced apart transversely of the track so as to be adapted for delivering lubricant respectively to the two opposite end regidns of the slide surface which are exposed alternately with each switching motion of the switch rail. Preferably the two nozzles are also each located at or below the level of the chair slide surface and,conveniently, they are mounted on a common holder, constituting a supply pipe, by means of which the nozzle jets are secured in position relatively to the track rails, for example on the sleeper, the common holder supply pipe extending transversely of the track and underneath the switch rail blade. The two nozzles may be located so that in one operation position or the other of the switch rail, the one or other nozzle lies directly underneath the switch rail but as explained this need not render the nozzle ineffective. If both nozzles eject lubricant simultaneously, the one which is not underneath the switch rail will deliver lubricant immediately onto the chair slide region which the switch rail is about to slide over and the other nozzle will initially deliver lubricant upwardly onto the underside of the switch rail along the line of contact with the edge of the chair slide though this will occur only for a very brief period because the switch rail will almost immediately have moved aside clear of he lubricant delivery path to allow lubricant to land directly onto the chair slide region which the slide rail is moving off. As regards the pipework distribution system connecting the nozzles of a switch lubricator with the pump, problems have also been encountered in providing an arrangement which is versatile to cope with different rail systems and to cope with variations in track layout within a given system whilst at the same time providing an arrangement which is not in the way of tamping or other maintenance operations. In yet another aspect of the invention, therefore, there is provided a railway track switch lubricator comprising a pump connected to a distribution pipework system for delivering lubricant from a reservoir to delivery nozzles located for projecting lubricant onto the slide surfaces of the switch rail chairs, the distribution pipework system including a feed pipe adapted to extend along the track on top of the sleepers and composed of rigid pipe sections which, in use, bridge the spacings between the sleepers without suppert from below and which are interconnected by connector pipe sections which are supported on the sleepers and having tappings for branch pipes leading to the nozzles, at least one telescopic connection being provided in the feed pipe between each pair of adjacent connector pipe sections so that their mutual spacing can be varied. Preferably, there are two telescopic connections between each pair of adjacent connector pipe sections conveniently afforded by making each rigid pipe section slidably..engaged at each end in the adjacent ends of the respective connectors, the sliding telescopic connections being sealed for example by anO ring located in an annular groove in the outside at the ends of each rigid pipe section. Such a feed pipe preferably comprises a common feed pipe extending generally along the middle of the track with branch pipes to each side for supplying lubricant for both switch rails. The branch pipes may be made of a suitable plastics material which is cut to length when the lubricator system is being installed, the branch pipes being laid along the top or side surfaces of the sleepers. Alternatively, the branch pipes may be rigid tubes, pre formed for installation, preferably with fixing brackets, in which case these branch tubes may themselves support the nozzle s . With any of the above aspects of the invention, the pump is preferably mechanically actuated by connection with the stretcher bar interconnecting the switch rails and by means of which the switch rails are displaced, so that pumping occurs during a switching action. Whether the pump is arranged to be actuated with each switching action or only periodically after a predetermined time or number of switching actions from a previous pump actuation, depends upon the frequency at which the chair slides need lubricating in any given installation and for any particular conditions. The pump, which is preferably a double acting piston and cylinder pump, is connected to the distribution pipework and to the reservoir for lubricant through suitable non return salving, and a pressure relief valve is also conveniently provided for adjusting the amount of lubricant to be delivered from the nozzles during an operation of the switch rails. The invention according to its various aspects may be put into practice in a number of ways but certain specific embodiments will now be described by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawing, in which Figure 1 is a diagranmatic plan.view of part of a railway track switch in accordance with the invention Figure 2 is a diagrammatic perspective view corresponding to Figure 1 showing the lubricator distribution pipework Figure 3 is a detail plan view of a first embodiment showing two adjacent switch rail chairs with two lubricator nozzles for each chair Figure 4 is an elevation of one of those switch rail chairs taken on the line IV IV of Figure 3 Figure 5A is a view of two of the nozzles and their nozzle holder taken on the line V V ofFigure 2, and Figure 5B is an end view on Figure 5A Figure 6 is a view of a telescopic connection in the lubricant feed pipe, as viewed on the arrowVI of Figure 2. Figure 7 is a view corresponding to Figure 4 of a further embodiment in which there is one lubricator nozzle only for each chair Figure 8 is a view taken on the line VIII VIII in Figure 7 showing the lubricator trajectory and Figure 9 is a view similar to that of Figure 8 but for a further embodiment for a double, concrete sleeper supporting two adjacent chairs. The railway track switch shown in Figure 1 comprises two fixed rails 1 and 2 anchored to spaced sleepers 3, and two displaceable switch rails or blades 5 and 6 which taper finely at their free ends which are interconnected by a stretcher bar 8 connected to an actuating mechanism not shown for shifting the end of the switch rails laterally to one or other of their operative. positions. The switch rails 5 and 6 along that part of their length which moves laterally areSupported on bearing or slide surfaces 10 see Figures 3 and 4 of switch rail chairs 11, the foot of each switch rail sliding directly on the bearing surface 10. Trouble free switching of the switch rails 5 and 6 is dependent upon their free sliding on the bearing surfaces 10 which therefore need to be lubricated from time to time, the amount and frequency of lubrication depending for example upon switching frequency, the climate and other environmental conditions. The lubricator distribution system shown in more detail in Figure 2 in which the rails and most of the sleepers have been omitted for clarity comprises generally a double acting piston and cylinder pump 12 the piston of which is connected to the stretcher bar 8, and a non return valve block 14 through which the working chambers of the cylinder are alternately connected on the one hand to a reservoir tank 15 containing lubricant oil and located to one side of the track, and on the other hand to a distribution pipework for delivering oil to each of the switch rail chairs 11. The pipework is consituted by a longitudinal feed pipe 17 extending along the track between the rails and over the sleepers with two branch pipes 18 branching off from the feed pipe connectors on each sleeper to each side and terminating in a jet holder or nozzle.In this embodiment, each jet holder 20 has two nozzle jets 21 for each chair, as will be explained with reference to Figures 3 to 5 in the further embodiments there is a single nozzle at the end of each branch pipe, as will be explained with reference to Figures 7 to 9. The feed pipe 17 which usually will extend midway between the rails1 though in places it may pass nearer to one rail if necessary to avoid other equipment on or between the sleepers, is made up of rigid steel pipe sections 25 extending between the sleepers 3 and tubular connectors 26 the length of which correspond to the width of each sleeper. The connectors 26 rest on top of the sleepers and have an internal diameter slightly larger than the outside diameter of the pipe sections 25 which at each end fit telescopically within the adjacent connectors 26 as shown in Figure 6. An O ring 27 accommodated in an annular groove in the outer surface at each end of the pipe sections 25 forms a seal whilst permitting relative sliding together or apart to any required position within a given range of each pipe section 25 and the connectors 26 which it engages. These telescopic connections mean that during installation, the position of the connectors 26 can be adjusted to suit the particular sleeper spacing of different rail networks and to cope with. any variation in that spacing in a given network. In a particular embodiment 75 mm adjustment at each connection is possible which is adequate for most requirements.Furthermore, because the pipe sections 25 are rigid, they bridge the spaces between the sleepers without requiring support from below. Midway along each connector 26, its. wall is tapped on each side to receive respective couplings for the end of the branch pipes 18 which in this embodiment are made of plastios tubing. In other embodiments the branch pipes may be rigid pipes for example of steel either straight or bent in places to suit particular sleeper or other railway configurations or installations. The other ends of the branch pipes 18 are connected to the respective nozzles or jet holders 20. The branch pipes 18 rest on and may be secured to the sleepers 3. In the case where the branch pipes 18 are made of plastics, they can be readily cut to the appropriate length during installation, and another advantage of using plastics tubing, apart from facilitating installation in this way, is that plastics is electrically insulating so that the pipework is not capable of causing an electrical short across the rails if the latter form part of an electrical signalling circuit. Whilst there are two telescopic connections between each pair of adjacent connectors 26, it might be possible in other embodiments to arrange for there to be a single telescope connection between each two connectors. Using two telescope connectors however provides more versatility and larger adjustment. The pipe sections 25 can be pushed into the connectors 26 at each end up to about midway along the length of the latter, the branch couplings where they project into the bore of the connector 26 serving conveniently as stops. One of.the r jet holders 20 and its two nozzle jets 21 is shown in more detail in Figures 3 to 5. Te holder 20 is a metal tubular body closed at one end and tapped at the other to receive a conventional coupling by which the end of the respective branch pipe 18 can be readily connected. Near each end of the holder 20 its wall is tapped for receiving the nozzle jets 21 which are of a type particularly applicable for spraying lubricant oil producing a flat spray pattern which covers an area to be lubricated as is indicated in Figure 3 forthe left hand nozzle 21 for the upper chair. Inside each nozzle jet is a restrictor orifice to meter or regulate the quantity of oil ejected at a given pressure, a strainer for filtering the oil and a fine jet hole which opens axially below a curved deflector 22 see Figure 5B specially shaped to produce the required spray pattern. Each jet holder 20 is sited, as shown in Figure 3 particularly, alongside the respective switch rail chair 11 and fixed to the sleeper 3 by suitable clips not shown so that the nozzles 21 are positioned generally opposite the two end regions of the bearing slide surface 10 of the chair 11. Furthermore, as shown in Figure 4, each nozzle 21 is situated at or below the level of the bearing surface 10 and therefore below the movable switch rail 6 or 5 . The nozzle jets 21 are so arranged and aimed that, in operation, lubricant oil is ejected under pressure in an initially upwardly directed trajectory, as shown for the right hand nozzle 21 in Figure 4, which lands on the bearing surface 10 over a relatively wide area. In operation, as the switch rails 5 and 6 are displaced in either direction, the stretcher bar 8 actuates the pump 12, either at each operation or after every so many switching operations, and the pump then forces lubricant oil through the feed pipe 17 and branch pipes 18 to all the nozzles 20. The amount of oil is adjusted by means of a manually operable pressure relief valve not shown which prevents overload and provides adjustment to a precise amount of oil to be ejected dependent upon particular requirements the amount may be set low and or the frequency of lubrication may be low for points which are in frequent use and increased for those which are operated only occassionally. Surplus oil is re routed back to the reservoir 15. During emission, one nozzle 21 of each pair will apply oil to that part of the bearing surface 10 onto which the switch rail moves and the other nozzle will initially eject oil up against the underneath of the slide rail where its lower face meets the chair slide surface 10 but almost immediately thereafter the switch rail will move clear of the nozzle and oil from it will fall onto the other end region of the chair slide surface 10 the oil on that region will serve to prevent rust or drying of that surface in the event that a considerable period elapses before the switch rails are shifted again or a further application of lubricant is made . It will be noted from Figures 1 and 2 that the pump connects into the feed pipe 17 at a position nearer to the free ends of the switch rails. This is advantageous because in practice slightly more oil will be ejected from the nozzles 21 which are nearer to the free ends of the switch rails where the lateral displacement is greatest than from the nozzles progressively farther from the pump owing to the pressure losses within the pipework. This will be the case where all the nozzles are the same. It would of course be possible to provide different nozzles along the length of the switch rails but that would make installation more complicated. It is, as mentioned, possible to provide a single nozzle at some or all of the chairs particularly those farthest from the free ends of the switch rails.Such a possibility is illustrated in the further embodiment shown in Figures 7 and 8. Where practical, like reference numerals have been used for like parts. Thus, the fixed and mpving rails 2 and 6, the sleeper 3 here shown made of wood , the chair 11 and its slide surface 10, and the lubricant branch feed pipe 18 are all generally similar to those of the earlier embodiment except that here the branch pipe 18 is made of rigid steel tubing, pre formed to suit the particular railway installation. Being rigid, the branch tube 18 can itself support the nozzle near to the level of the chair slide surface 10 by means of a shallow double bend 30 located adjacent the chair 10.The portion of the rigid brandh pipe 18 between the connector 26 of the longitudinal feed pipe 17 and the double bend 30 lies flat along the sleeper and is provided with welded on brackets 31 that it may be fastened to the sleeper, by screws for example. At the free end of the branch pipe 18 there is an elbow compression fitting, in the upwardly directed end of which is a single nozzle 32 of a similar type to that oflthe individual nozzles 21 described earlier. A single nozzle 32 has been found to be effective in manyapplications,and in any case for some railway installations,where the switch rail overhangs the chair slide 10, as shown at. 33 in Figure 7 for the switched position of the moving rail 6 indicated in dash dot line , it is not practical to have a second nozzle near to the inner end of the chair slide 10. As shown in Figure 8, the lubricant from the single nozzle 32 is projected in an initially upward trajectory so as to land on the slide surface 10 of the chair 11. Since the nozzle is at or below the level of the chair slide surface 10., it is located close tofthe slide surface 10 but out of the way of the moving rail and away from other equipment in that region. Figure 9 shows a further embodiment which is generally similar to that of Figure 8 except that the branch pipes 18 are here fixed.to the vertical side faces 34 of the sleeper 35 which here is a concrete sleeper supporting two adjacent chairs. In Figure 9 there is also shown a hot gas duet 36 which is provided in some national railway systems, so as to illustrate how the lubrication nozzles and pipework in accordance with the invention are well arranged in order not to interfere with such other equipment. Thus, in each of the embodiments, owing to the location of the nozzles 21 and 32 below the chair slides 10 they are sited very close to the regions to be lubricated yet out of the way of the switch rail 6 and other railway equipment such as switch heaters. All the pipework is also largely placed so as not to interfere with maintenance operations. In other embodiments, it may not. be necessary to locate the nozzles completely below the level of the chair slides, especially if there are two nozzles positioned somewhat higher, but so that they do not interfere with the switch rail, and arranged to lubricate both end regions of the chair slide. Also, the type of nozzle may be different, for example to give an ordinary, plain jet of oil rather than a flat spray pattern, though other special spray patterns could be used. It will be understood that the pump may be connected to some other part of the switch rail actuator mechanism than the stretcher bar, or directly to one of the switch rails alternatively, if required, the pump could be arranged to be operated by means quite independent of the switch actuator means.
