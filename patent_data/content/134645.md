# Method of forming thin film.

## Abstract
A method of forming with good reproducibility a high quality thin film of a metal or metal compound by a vapor growth method on a substrate placed in a quartz reaction tube which has the steps of, prior to the formation of the thin film forming an intermediate film 21 of a material having good adhesion with both quartz, and the metal or metal compound on the inner wall of the reaction tube 1 , and forming a film 22 of the metal or metal compound for the thin film on the intermediate film 21 .
