# METHOD FOR OBTAINING A CONCRETE REINFORCED WITH STEEL FIBRES, AND THE CONCRETE OBTAINED IN THIS MANNER

## Abstract
A method for obtaining a concrete reinforced with steel fibres and the concrete obtained in this manner are described. The method consists essentially of producing steel fibres by drawing, cutting said fibres into segments of predetermined length, and mixing the segments obtained in this manner into a concrete mix. When set, the concrete obtained by the aforesaid method incorporates said steel fibres, of which the distribution and density are varied in relation to the stresses in the items to be constructed.
