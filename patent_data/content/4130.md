# Continuously variable transmission mechanism.

## Abstract
A continuously variable transmission incorporating a variator having first and second sheaves 16,44 of adjustable effective diameter by moving one pulley half axially with respect to another to vary the effective diameter of each sheave 16,44 for engagement with a flexible drive band 74 has a fixed pulley half 17,45 of one sheave facing the moveable pulley half 23,46 of the other sheave to maintain alignment of the drive band 74 in the usual way. Both adjustable pulley halves 23,46 are operated from adjustment means 25,18,48,47 on the same side of the drive band 74 , one adjustment means 25,18 being connected through the centre of the fixed pulley half 17 to the moveable pulley half 23 and that fixed pulley half 17 being mounted by its outer periphery 10 .
