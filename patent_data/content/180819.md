# Thermoplastic resin composition.

## Abstract
A thermoplastic resin composition having high heat resistance and good impact resistance, which comprises A at least one unsaturated dicarboxylic acid anhydride polymer obtainable by polymerizing at least one unsaturated dicar boxylic acid anhydride and at least one aromatic vinyl compound with or without at least one other polymeriable monomer in the presence or absence of a rubbery material and B at least one olefin polymer chosen from B 1 an olefin alkyl unsaturated carboxylate copolymer, B 2 an unsaturated carboxylic acid modified olefin polymer and B 3 an epoxy group containing olefin polymer, the weight proportion of the unsaturated dicarboxylic acid anhydride polymer A and the olefin polymer B being 100 1 100.
