## Description
CASTING heretofore, skull melting has been used in a number of applications such as the melting of zirconia to form imitation diamonds. Skull melting is a known technique, sometimes referred to as scold crucible , wherein the liquid melt is formed and contained within a crust or solid layer of its own material. This technique allows materials to be melted for which there are no known crucibles for melting same. By suitably shaping the skull crucible it is possible for radio frequency energy to pass through the crucible into the normally solid material contained in the crucible, thereby heating the solid material to form a liquid melt.A conventional skull crucible consists of a water cooled base which has a diametral split therein and which supports a plurality of upstanding water cooled copper fingers. The fingers are arranged on the base to define a volume bounded on the bottom by the base, on the sides by the fingers, and open at the top. Small gaps are left between the copper fingers to allow radio frequency energy to penetrate into the interior volume which initially holds normally solid material to be melted, for example, zirconia powder. Water is circulated through the base and fingers while the radio frequency energy is imparted to the material contained in the chamber. The material contained in the skull crucible chamber, because of the radio frequency energy imparted thereto, melts except for a relatively thin crust or skin which remains solid next to the fingers, thereby forming a skull which remains solid because of the water cooled crucible even though essentially all of the remainder of the contents of the crucible chamber becomes liquid. By forming this relatively thin jacket of material between the skull melt crucible and the liquid melt, the liquid melt is contained in spite of the gaps between the fingers of the crucible, and contamination of the liquid melt is prevented. Conventional skull melting is a batch process in which the liquid melt is sometimes allowed to resolidify in the crucible before removal therefrom. Melt spinning is a process wherein a liquid melt is forced through a nozzle onto a moving heat sink so that the liquid melt is essentially solidified in transit on the heat sink and, after solidification, is continuously removed from the heat sink. This is a conventional high volume technique for producing metal or metallic ribbon, especially relatively thin ribbons, because the moving or rotating heat sink provides a large mass which rapidly cools the relatively thin liquid melt film deposited thereon from the melt spinning nozzle. Since metals are good thermal conductors, cooling rates of 1,000,0000 Kelvin per second have been obtained. Thus, a large volume of continuous ribbon can be produced by this technique. Normally, in this technique, liquid melt is charged to the melt spinning crucible and then forced through the melt spinning nozzle onto the moving heat sink.A conventional resistance heating coil is normally employed just to maintain the liquid melt molten while waiting to pass through the nozzle. In accordance with this invention, melt spinning is combined with skull melting to produce a method and apparatus which is particularly useful in the manufacture of ribbons of high purity and in a high volume from materials having no known crucibles in which they can be melted. Accordingly, a first object of the invention is to provide a method for casting ribbon from a liquid melt of a normally solid material compris ing skull melting the solid material in a skull melting crucible to form the liquid melt, and then melt spinning the liquid melt into ribbon form directly from the skull melting crucible. A second object of the invention is to provide an apparatus for forming a ribbon by melt spinning a liquid melt of a normally solid material through nozzle means, comprising skull melting crucible means which is in open communication with the nozzle so that liquid melt formed in the crucible passes directly into the nozzle for melt spinning into said ribbon. A third object of the invention is to provide an apparatus for forming a ribbon by melt spinning a liquid melt of a normally solid material through nozzle means, comprising crucible means having a hollow chamber means in communication with a melt spinning nozzle at one end thereof, the crucible and nozzle being formed of a material having high thermoconductivity and essentially no electrical conductivity, means associated with the crucible for imparting radio frequency energy to the crucible to heat the solid material in the chamber and thereby form the liquid melt, and means carried in intimate physical contact with the crucible and nozzle for cooling both the crucible and nozzle to form a skull of solid material in the interior of both the crucible and nozzle between the liquid melt and the crucible and nozzle. The preferred embodiment of this invention will now be described by way of example, with reference to the drawings accompanying this specification in which FIGURE 1 shows an elevational view of a conventional skull melting crucible. FIGURE 2 is a top view of the crucible ofFIGURE 1. FIGURE 3 is a cross sectional view of conventional melt spinning apparatus. FIGURE 4 illustrates a cross sectional embodiment of this invention wherein skull melting is combined with melt spinning. FIGURE 5 shows yet another cross sectional embodiment of this invention which utilizes skull melting combined with melt spinning. FIGURE 6 is a top view of part of the appara tus of FIGURE 5. FIGURE 7 shows a modification of a melt spin ning nozzle which is useful in this invention. More specifically, FIGURE 1 shows a conven tional skull melting crucible which has a closed base 2 and a plurality of upstanding fingers 3 which are spaced apart from one another as shown by gaps 4. Base 2 and fingers 3 all have internal conduits therein for the circulation of a cooling fluid such as water therethrough, the cooling fluid being admitted to the crucible by way of pipe 5 as shown by arrow 6. Heated cooling fluid, having circulated through base 2 and fingers 3, is removed by way of pipe 7 as shown by arrow 8. FIGURE 2 shows a top view of crucible 1 show ing closed base 2 with fingers 3 mounted circumferentially therearound, thereby defining an in terior chamber in which the normally solid material to be melted is placed and melted in situ.Base 2 has a diametral split 2 composed of a non magnetic material to stop any magnetic flux that would otherwise be set up in base 2. FIGURE 3 shows melt spinning apparatus 10 coinposed of a melt spinning crucible 11 whose in terior chamber 12 contains a liquid melt 13 which, by way of pressure supplied by a gas through pipe 14 as shown by arrow 15, is forced through nozzle 16 onto a rotating wheel heat sink 17. Wheel 17 turns in the direction of arrow 18, so that liquid material deposited on the wheel at 19 is continu ously carried away in the direction of arrow 18. While being so carried away the material is solidified by cooling. The solidified ribbon 20 is removed from wheel 17 in a continuous manner. Wheel 17 can be internally cooled with a cooling fluid much like as described for the skull melt crucible above, or by blowing a cooling fluid such as air onto wheel 17 as shown by pipe 21. Liquid melt 13 is maintained in a molten state by way of a conventional heating coil 22 which is wrapped around crucible 11. Coil 22 can be an electrical resistance heater, a radio frequency coil, or the like. In accordance with this invention, skull melting is combined with melt spinning. Thus,FIGURE 4 shows a skull melt crucible 30 which has a closed base member 31 which carries a plurality of upstanding cooled fingers 32 that are spaced from one another as shown by gaps 33. Base 31 and fingers 32 can be of the same configuration as described for crucible 1 of FIGURES 1 and 2. Base 31 and fingers 32 are also artificially cooled by way of inlet and outlet pipes 34 and 35, respec tively, so that a cooling fluid can be introduced through pipe 34 as shown by arrow 36 for circula tion through base 31 and fingers 32, heated cool ing fluid being removed by way of pipe 35 as shown by arrow 37. Skull melt crucible 30 is different from a conventional skull melt crucible as described forFIGURES 1 and 2 in that it is not a batch type apparatus in that it has been fitted with an internal melt spinning nozzle 40. This way, liquid melt in the interior chamber of crucible 30 can pass through nozzle 40 to be deposited at 42 on moving heat sink 41. Heat sink 41 is rotating in the direction of arrow 43 and thereby conveys deposited melt away from point 42 in the direction of arrow 43 while at the same time cooling same into a solid ribbon 44. Ribbon 44 is continually removed from heat sink 41. Thus, it is readily apparent that the advantages of skull melting and melt spinning are combined to produce a high quality, high purity product 44. A radio frequency generator and coil is combined with crucible 30 in the same manner it is combined with a conventional skull melt crucible, but is not shown in FIGURE 4 for sake of clarity.The radio frequency generator imparts radio frequency energy to the normally solid material held in the interior chamber of crucible 30 to melt all of same except for a thin solid skin between the melt and cooled fingers 32. A wide range of power and radio frequencies can be employed depending upon the material to be melted, but generally, radio frequencies of from about 10 kilohertz to about 10 megahertz and power levels in the range of from about 1 to about 100 kilowatts can be employed thereby achieving very high temperatures, for example, as high as 40000C, for melting even ultra refractory materials. The apparatus and the method described in relation to FIGURE 4 above can be used for many types of continuous casting applications beyond just ultra refractory material. For example, this approach could be employed for making single crystal type silicon ribbon for photovoltaic applications and for numerous other applications which become obvious to those skilled in the art once being apprised of this invention. FIGURE 5 shows one embodiment within the broad concept of this invention wherein an enclosed crucible 50 contains a hollow, open crucible chamber 51 in which normally solid material to be melted is deposited. One end of chamber 51 is in open communication with melt spinning nozzle 52. Crucible 50 has a conduit 53 through the wall thereof so that a pressurizing gas 54 can be supplied to chamber 51 to thereby force liquid melt through nozzle 52 onto moving heat sink 55 which is rotating in the direction of arrow 56. In this embodiment, nozzle 52 is surrounded by an annular member 57 which is designed to cool nozzle 52 in the same manner that crucible 50 is cooled to provide a thin layer of solid material 58 which remains unmelted and between liquid melt 59 and the interior walls of crucible 50 and nozzle 52. Thus, liquid melt 59 never touches the actual walls of crucible 50 and nozzle 52. A helical coil of hollow, electrically conductive pipe such as copper is coiled about crucible 50 in an intimate physical contacting manner. For example, in the exemplary embodiment of FIGURE 5, coil 60 fits into mating grooves 61 in the outer wall of crucible 50. Other means for obtaining intimate physical contact between coil 60 and crucible 50 will be apparent to one skilled in the art, and all are within the scope of this invention. An exaggerated gap 62 is shown merely to demonstrate clearly that coil 60 fits into a matching groove 61 in crucible 50. In this embodiment of the invention, coil 60 serves both as a cooling conduit and a radio frequency device and coil 60 carries radio frequency energy to be imparted to the interior of chamber 51 to form melt 59 while at the same time carrying in its hollow interior cooling fluid which has been introduced as shown by arrow 63. Cooling fluid circulates through coil 60 and then passes into interior conduit 64 in member 57 thereby to cool that member and form the solidified layer of material 58 inside nozzle 52. The heated cooling fluid is removed from the apparatus as shown by arrow 65. Since crucible 50 is a solid material in this embodiment of the invention, there being no air spaces provided as shown by gaps 33 for FIGURE 4 to allow radio frequency energy to reach interior chamber 51, crucible 50 is made up of a material which has a high thermal conductivity and essen tially no electrical conductivity. Such materials include boron nitride, yttrium oxide i.e. Y203 , magnesium oxide i.e. MgO , zirconium oxide i.e. ZrO2 , and combinations thereof. Thus, in the operation of the apparatus of FIGURE 5, solid material to be melted is charged to chamber 51 and melted by radio frequency energy from coil 60. Liquid melt 59 is thereby formed, but because of the cooling function of coil 60, solid layer 58 is maintained on the interior walls of crucible 50 and nozzle 52. Liquid melt 59 is then forced through nozzle 52 toward heat sink 55, deposited thereon at 66 in a still molten state, and carried away from 66 in the direction of arrow 56 while being solidified and thereby forming solid ribbon 67. The ribbon is eventually removed from heat sink 55 in the same manner shown for ribbon 44 in FIGURE 4. FIGURE 6 is a top view of member 57 which shows entry aperture 70, which communicates with the interior of coil 60 shown in FIGURE 5. In ternal cooling conduit 64 is shown to circle member 57 and then exit same through conduit 72 and leave the apparatus completely, as shown by arrow 65. Aperture 73 in the center of member 57 fits about nozzle 52 and is in intimate physical contact therewith. If necessary, depending upon the material from which member 57 is made, a dielectric insert 74 may be employed to prevent setting up of electrical current in member 57. FIGURE 7 demonstrates a modification within the scope of this invention wherein a skull melting crucible 80 with its melt spinning nozzle 81 in communication therewith contains a liquid melt 82 and, because of the cooling means not shown for sake of clarity much like those described in relation to member 57 and coil 60 of FIGURE 5, forms a solid layer 83 between the interior walls of crucible 80 and nozzle 81 and the liquid melt 82. However, in this embodiment an insert 85 of solid material, with a longitudinally extending aperture 86 therethrough, is placed in nozzle 81 to take up essentially the entire inner volume of nozzle 81.Thus, solid skin 83 of unmelted material is formed between the inner walls of nozzle 81 and outer walls of insert 85, thereby providing a seal of frozen melt so that liquid melt passes through aperture 86 and exits therefrom at 87 towards a heat sink not shown as shown by arrow 88 to be deposited on the heat sink and solidified as described for FIGURE 5. Insert 85 helps control the cooling and formation of skin 83 and helps avoid the possibility of skin 83 growing to such an extent in nozzle 81 that it tends to plug nozzle 81. Insert 85 is removable so that it can be replaced by a new insert or removed entirely should it be desired to operate the apparatus with a fully open nozzle as shown in FIGURE 5. Example Apparatus is employed substantially as shown in FIGURE 5 wherein crucible 50 and member 57 are formed from boron nitride and are used to melt MOxBl x. Coil 8 is formed from copper conduit which is wrapped in eight helical turns around crucible 50. Any gaps such as 62 between coil 60 and the walls of indentations 61 in crucible 50 are filled with ceramic cement, which has a high thermal conductivity and substantially no electrical conductivity, to provide for a more intimate physical contact between coil 60 and crucible 50. Radio frequency energy of 500 1000 kilohertz at a power level of up to 100 kilowatts is imparted to the crucible by way of coil 60 while ambient temperature tap water is circulated through the interior of coil 60 for cooling purposes.The normally solid material in chamber 51 is thereby heated to greater than 20000C and formed into a liquid melt except for about 0.5 millimeter thick skin 58 which is left solid to contain liquid melt 59 and keep same from contacting the inner walls of chamber 50 and nozzle 52. A gas such as argon is supplied to chamber 51 by way of conduit 53 at a pressure of up to approximately 2.2 kg cm2 to help force liquid melt through nozzle 52 onto heat sink 55 which is an air cooled rotating wheel approximately 40 millimeters wide, 25.4 cm. in diameter, and rotating at 2000 rpm. The wheel is essentially at ambient temperature so that the liquid melt deposited thereon solidifies to form a ribbon approximately 6 millimeters wide and less than one millimeter thick. The ribbon is then removed from wheel 55 as shown for FIGURE 4. Reasonable variations and modifications are possible within the scope of this disclosure without departing from the spirit and scope of this invention.
