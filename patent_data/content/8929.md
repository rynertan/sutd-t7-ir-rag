# Motors and gas supply apparatus therefor.

## Abstract
A gas operated motor 123 , notably for use in powering model aircraft, has COâ‚‚ gas or the like working fluid fed to it from a capsule 101 . The gas is superheated in use by the heat generated by the reversible adsorption, persorption or other physico chemical association of a selected fluid which may be the same as the working fluid with a reactant 116 . After use, the reactant can be regenerated by the application of heat and or reduced pressure.
