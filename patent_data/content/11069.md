## Description
h process for preparing over based, oil soluble magnesium salts. This invention relates to over based, oil soluble magnesium salts of sulphonic acids having metal ratios ranging from approximately 10 up to approximately 40 and processes for preparing such over based magnesium salts of sulphonic acids.Over based, oil soluble magnesium salts of sulphonic acids are used as additives in oil based compositions, such as lubricants, greases, fuels, and the like. They function as detergents and acid neutralizers, thereby reducing wear and corrosion and extending the engine life.Highly basic magnesium salts of a sulphonic acid having a metal ratio of equivalents of magnesium to equivalents of sulphonic acid ranging from 10 up to 40 or more, particularly the higher metal ratios of 20 to 40 have been difficult to prepare in a one step operation using gO as a Mg source. In systems previously described, either insufficient magnesium was dispersed or an unfiltered product resulted.It has been discovered that over based magnesium sulphonates may be prepared in a one step operation by using a reaction promoter system comprising 1 a carboxylic compound selected from the group of compounds consisting of lower carboxylic acids, lower carboxylic anhydriaes, substi tuted lower carboxylic acids, metal salts and esters of lower carboxylic acids and mixtures thereof, all having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms 2 water and optionally 3 an alcohol selected from the group of compounds consisting of lower alkanols, lower alkoxy alkanols and mixtures thereof, all having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms. Such a promoter system gives a high quality over based magnesium sulphonate having very high metal ratios which is suitable for use in various types of oil based compositions.It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a process for manufacturing oil soluble, over based magnesium salts of sulphonic acids having metal ratios ranging from approximately 10 and upwards to approximately 40 or more where the product is prepared in a one step operation of contacting the reaction mixture with an acidic gas.It is a further object of the invention to provide a reaction promoter system for use in processes for manufacturing oil soluble, over based magnesium salts of sulphonic acids having metal ratios of 10 up to 40 or more.It is another object of the invention to provide a process for preparing a magnesium salt of a sulphonic acid having very high metal ratios wherein over basing of the sulphonic acid is accomplished by using a promoter system in combination with a light form of magnesium oxide.This invention provides a reaction promoter system for use in the manufacture of an over based, oil soluble magnesium salt of a sulphonic acid having metal ratios of from approximately 10 up to approximately 40 or more, in a one step operation of contacting an acidic gas with a mixture containing the sulphonic acid to be over based.According to the present invention there is provided a process for preparing an over based oil soluble magnesium salt of a sulphonic acit having a metal ratio of equivalents of magnesium to equivalents of sulphonic acid of from approx mately 10 to approximately 40 comprising contacting an acidic gas with a mixture comprising a an oil soluble magnesium salt of a sulphonic acid1 b from approximately 10 equivalents up to approximately 40 equivalertm of a light magnesium oxide per equivalent of sulphonic acid, c a promoter system comprising 1 from approximately 0.5 to approximately 5 eouinalents of an essentially oil insoluble carboxylic compounc per equivalent of Eulphonic acid, said compound being selected from the group of compounds consisting of lower carboxylic acids, lower carboxylic anhydrides, substituted lower carboxylic acids, and mixtures thereof, all having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms, 2 from approximately 2 to approximately 30 equivalents of water per equivalent of sulphonic acid, and 3 from 0 to approximately 35 equivalents of an alcohol per equivalent of sulphonic acid, said alcohol being selected from the group of components consisting of lower alkanols, lower alkoxy alkanols and mixtures thereof, all having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms, and an inert solvent for lowering the viscosity of said mixture to facilitate mixing said contacting being conducted at a temperature ranging from approximately 1000 500F up to reflux temperature of said mixture and the volatile components being stripped from the reaction mixture after absorption of the acidic gas by the reaction mixture is at a desired level to give an over based, oil soluble magnesium salt of a sulphonic acid.The reaction mixture may be filtered either before or after the stripping of the volatile components to give the product in solution or in concentrated form.Additional water and or alcohol may be added continuously or portion wise to the reaction mixture during the time that the acidic gas is contacted with the mixture. The amount of water used in total should not exceed 30 equ va lents per equivalent of sulphonic acid and the total amount of alcohol used should not exceed 35 equivalents per rliva lent of sulphonic acid.The aforementioned, and other objects, advantages a features of the invention will become apparent in the following detailed discussion of preferred embouiments accor . to this invention. It is understood that the followin, preferred embodiments are not to be interpreted as li ing the scope of the invention. Promoter SystemThe essentially oil insoluble carboxylic compound i represeated by the formula XCOOY wherein x is H, CH2OF, CH2Cl, OE2 r, OH2C0CR3, i or RNH2 and Y is E, R, or E where R is an alkyl radial of from n to 4 carbon atoms, the sum of all the carbo atoms in the R radicals not exceeding 5, and Mn is an a ali or alkaline earth metal atom wherein n is an intege .Jf 1 or 2.Preferred oil insoluble carboxylic compounds of his inven tion are acetic acid, propionic acid, butanoi id, glycine, chloroacetic acid, bromoacetic acid, glyolic acid, ethyl ac toacetate, sodium acetate, calcium Fetate, and magnesium acetate. These compounds may be ued individually or in combination with one another where tn amount of this promoter ranges from .5 up to 5 equivalent per equivalent of oil soluble sulphonic acid. Preferab the amount ranges from 0.7 to 1.3 equivalents. It 8 been found in most instances that if over 5 equivalen of the promoter are used, the reaction mixture becomes ery viscous and although a product is obtained, the vJcosity of the mixture makes the isolation of the product the introduction of acidic gas into the mixture during e latter part of the process difficult. The initial reaction mixture should have at least 2 equiva lents of water per equivalent of sulphonic acid. The mix ture may have up to 15 equivalents of water where the preferred range in the initial mixture is from 2 to 8 equivalents of water per equivalent of sulphonic acid.Although the mechanism of the reaction is not fully understood1 it is theorised that the presence of water in the reaction mixture initiates absorption of the acidic gas by the reaction mixture. There is, however, a competing reaction for the water in the formation of hydroxides of the magnesium oxide. It is therefore preferred to minimise the reaction of water with the magnesium oxide by carryice out additions of small amounts of water to the reaction mixture during the time that the acidic gas is contacted with the reaction mixture so as to ensure that water is available in the system to promote the absorption of the acidic gas.The amount of water used determines to a certain extent the value of the metal ratio in that higher amounts of water used gives a higher metal ratio however, with higher amounts of water, there is usually a resultant haziness in the product. On the other hand, a deficiency of water causes higher viscosity in the reaction mixture and a lower metal ratio.The total amount of water added to the mixture over the entire reaction time should not exceed 30 equivalents per equivalent of oil soluble sulphonic acid used. The optimum amount of water to be used is determined by the amount of magnesium oxide used and the metal ratio desired because a larger amount of water results in a product having a higher metal ratio. Depending upon the end use of the product, it may be acceptable for the product to be hazy if used, for example, in bunker fuel oils and the like however, higher clarity products are required in lubricating oils.The alcohols used in this process include lower aliphatic alkanols, alkoxy alkanols, and mixtures thereof, where the number of carbon atoms does not exceed 5. Examples of the alcohols include methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, n propÅanol, butanol, and pentanolt The preferred alcohol is methanol because of the low cost and ease of removal from the reaction mixture. Examples of the alkoxy alkanols include methoxy ethanol and ethoxy ethanol.In order to initiate absorption of the acidic gas in the reaction mixture, it is not necessary to have an alcohol present in the initial mixture. It is believed, however, that the primary function of the alcohol is to promote the stability of the colloidal dispersion of magnesium salts in the oil. To this end there may be none or a small amount of alcohol in the initial reaction mixture and during the contacting with the acidic gas further amounts of alcohol are added either separately or in combination with the addition of water. It nas been found that lower metal ratios result if the total amount of alcohol to be added exceeds 35 equivalents per equivalent of sulphonic acid. The preferred amount tr be used ranges from 4 to 20 equivalents per equiv alent of sulphonic acid. SulDhonic AcidsThe suiphonic acids to be used in this process are those which are widely known by thole skilled in the art as oilsoluble sulphonic acids. Such compounds may be derived from natural petroleum fractions or various synthetically prepared sulphonated compounds. Typical oil soluble sulphonic acids which may be used include alkane sulphonic acids, aromatic sulphonic acids, alkaryl sulphonic acids, aralkyl sulphonic acids, petroleum sulphonic acids such as mahogany sulphonic acid, petroleum sulphonic acid, paraffin wax sulphonic acid, petroleum naphthene sulphonic acid, polyalkylated sulphonic acid, and other types of sulphonic acids whiCh may be obtained by fuming sulphuric acid treatment of petroleum fractions.It is understood, of course, that mlxtllres of the sulphonic acids may be used in preparing an over based magnesium Maphonate. The process according to this invention is operative with low sulphonate concentrations which thereby allows the use of oil based feed stock compositions containing as little as 10 by weight of magnesium sulphonate without further concentration of the oil based stock. Acidic GasAs is appreciated by those skilled in the art, various types of acidic gases may be used in over basing magnesium sulphonates. The preferred acidic gases are carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and hydrogen sulphide.These gases are bubbled through the reaction mixture as it is being mixed so that the selected gas or gases become intimately mixed and in contact with the components of the reaction mixture.The temperatures at which the contacting of the gas with the reaction mixture according to a preferred embodiment may vary from 10 to 93.3 C 50 to 200 F , although preferably within the 48.9 to 6. oC 120 to 1700F range. Magnesium OxideThe type of magnesium oxide used in a preferred embodiment of the process is the light or active form. Such magnesium oxides are sold under the Trade Marks MAGNESITE, available from Martin Marietta Chemicals, Hunt Valley, maryland MICHIGAN No. 3, MICHIGAN No. 15, MICHIGAN No. 340, available from OSchigan Chemical Corporation, Chicago, Illinois DOW I 2, DOW C 1, available from Dow Chemical Co., Midland, Li chigan ELASTOMAG 170, and ELASTOItiAG 20, available from M rton Chemical Co., Chicago, Illinois MAGLITE Y, available from Whittacker, Clark and Daniels, South Plainfield, NewYork LYCAL 93 11, and LYCAL 9O 575 available from Pigment and Chemicals, Toronto, Canada and MAGOX PREI IU 1 available from Basic Chemical, Cleveland, Ohio. The amount of magnesium oxide used is dependent upon the metal ratio desired in the final product. The metal ratio is the ratio of the number of equivalents of magnesium in the over based compound to the equivalents of sulphonic acid in the over based compound. Therefore, to obtain a metal ratio of, for example, 30, there must be at least thirty equivalents of magnesium oxide per equivalent of sulphonic acid in the initial reaction mixture.It is apparent that when the reaction is carried out under less favourable conditions at lower efficiencies, an excess of magnesium oxide beyond that determined by the metal ratio should be used to ensure sufficient incorporation of magnesium with the structure of the over based magnesium salt of the sulphonic acid. Inert DiluentsSeveral different types of volatile and non volatile diluents may be used in this process. The non volatile diluents are generally mineral or synthetic lubricating oils, such as lubricating oils having a viscosity around 100 SUS at 37.800 100 F or higher. The volatile diluents which are inert to the reaction are preferably hydrocarbons with boiling points ranging from 65.6 to 148.900 150 to 3000F . These can be aliphatic, aromatic, or a mixture of both types of solvents.Por example, naptha is a particularly useful diluent. Other types of suitable diluents include Stoddard solvent, cycloaliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, and corresponding halogenated hydrocarbons, such as chlorobenzene, and other conventional organic diluents generally employed in the over basing procedures in this particular art of manufactureThe amount of diluents used is sufficient to lower the visl cosity of the reaction mixture to facilitate mixing thereof during the introduction and contacting of the acidic gases with the mixture.The length of time that the acidic gas is contacted with the reaction mixture depends upon the desired level of magnesium in the over based magnesium sulphonate. The contacting of the gas with the mixture may be continued until no further gas is absorbed to indicate that substantially all of the magnesium oxide originally introduced into the system has been reacted to form an over based magnesium sulphonate. To determine wben the absorption of the gas is complete, the flow rate of the acidic gas being introouced is compared to the flow rate of the gas leaving the system. When the flow rate of leaving gas almost equals the flow rate of the in trounce gas, then the absorbtion is substantially complete.As can be appreciated by those skilled in the art, impurities and other variations in the selected petroleum feed stocks and magnesium oxides, according to this inventions can cause the resultant product to have slightly different metal ratios than that achieved in the following examples.These examples are intended to illustrate various aspects of the invention and are notintended to limit the scope of the invention in any way. Preparation 1 An oil soluble magnesium sulphonate was prepared by charging into a I litre reactor, equipped with stirrer, dropping funnel, thermometer, cooling and vent, 310 gm. of a solvent refined lubricating oil having a viscosity of 330 SUS at 37 8 C 100 F and while stirring vigorously, 103 gm. of 25 percent by weight oleum was added dropwise over a half hour period.

At the same time carbonation was initiated at 75 ml min. and continued for 3 hoursThe product of carbonation was then filtered with the aid of diatomaceous filter aid. Water, methanol and naptha were then stripped off by heating to 204.4 C 4000P leaving a product which was clear and bright with a magnesium content of 9.2 which is equivalent to a metal ratio of 27.0.

USA and 5.25g glacial acetic acid. The mixture was heated near its reflux temperature 65.6 C 150 F and carbon dioxide was introduced while mixing via the dispersion tube into the mixture at a flow rate of 100 Crbonation was continued for 2 1 2 hours, during which 8 gm. water and 8 gm. methanol were added after 40 minutes of carbonation and further 4 gm. of water and 8 gm.methanol were added after 80 minutes of carbonation.The product of the carbonation was filtered with the aid of diatomaceous filter aid. The volatile components of solvent water, methanol and naphtha were stripped off by beating to 204.4 C 400 F . h stream of C02 was introduced to the heated mixture to remove the last traces of solvents. The final product thus obtained was aclear and bright oil soluble solution which contained 9.4 by weight magnesium, 26.5 by weight magnesium sulphonate and had a viscosity of 525 SUS at 96.9 C 2I00F . he metal ratio of the product was 14.8.
