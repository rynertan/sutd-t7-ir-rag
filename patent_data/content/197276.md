# Process to manufacture printed circuit boards PCB S and related new products.

## Abstract
The manufactuing process of printed circuit boards pcb s , generally consisting of a support which on a major face or side carries circuit components according to the requested design and on its second major face or side carries the soldered wires corresponding to said circuit components, is now based on the fact that the designs of the component side, respectively of the soldering side are each transformed into labile electrostatic images on which good conductive metallic poweder toner is applied. The so obtained tracks are printed on insulating sheets one printed with tracks reproducing the component side design, and an other with the tracks reproducing the solder side and said printed sheets are fixed on the pcs rigid and thick support which is thereafter treated to enlarge adequately the conductive tracks.
