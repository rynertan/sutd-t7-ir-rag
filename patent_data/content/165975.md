## Description
This invention relates generally to the field of state machine logic and more specifically, to a modular, logically redundant, multiple input gate in the form of a high speed, low power field programmable logic array in which Boolean logic functions can be programmed by the user despite the presence of component faults, thereby increasing production yields and network reliability. The desirability of an integrated circuit logic device which can realize any logical function of a fixed number of variables is well known in the art. The capability of a logic device for implementing all possible Boolean functions of its variables is in this description called completeness . For a gate with N input variables, the number of different Boolean functions is equal to 2 raised to the power 2 to the power N. A gate would therefore be complete if it can be set to any of this set of logic functions. Gates with similar properties have been called universal. However, this term usually means that all the set of such functions can be accommodated with a given set of gates. Thus, universal is more a term on the level of applications, i.e., which or how many functions can be implemented. Completeness is a term about capabilities and the relevant parameter is the number of input variables not the maximum number of functions. Universal logic circuits are discussed in prior art literature including an article entitled Universal Logic Circuits and Their Modular Realizations by S.S. Yau and C.K. Tang at pages 297 305 of the 1968 Spring Joint Computer Conference proceedings. An important advantage of redundancy is fault tolerance. If one certain state of the control lines does not give the proper behavior due to a fault, it may very well be possible that other control settings for the same Boolean function still accomplish the desired response in the logic gate. The degree to which redundancy renders a logic gate fault tolerant, depends to a great extent upon the nature and location of the fault within the logic gate. However, in general terms the probability that in a redundant logic gate all the equivalent control states are faulty is significantly smaller than is the probability of failure in a non redundant gate in which a fault is present. An additional advantageous feature of redundant logic gates relates to their use in adaptive networks. To date, most hardware designs and VLSI systems are based on fixed combinational logic design. However, recent research in robotics, including such fields as pattern recognition, speech understanding, artificial intelligence and expert systems, has uncovered the need for adaptive systems and dynamically reprogrammable architectures. Robotic systems will tend toward problem solving machines that do not require a programmer to do explicit task decomposition and load the solution in the form of a sequential algorithm into the machine. Rather, presented with an abstract goal, the machine will converge on its own to a solution. It will be seen hereinafter that the present invention, in addition to providing a fault tolerant logic gate network, also provides a network which is a basic building block of adaptive systems. The closest prior art of which the applicants are currently aware is a multiplexer tree described by Yau. However, there are several critical distinctions between the invention herein disclosed and the Yau mux tree. One fundamental difference is that the Yau mux tree is a hierarchial array in which all the control signals are entered at the lowest level of the hierarchy while the data input variables are applied to each level of the hierarchy. However, in the present invention it will be seen that the control signals are applied to each node independently of the other nodes in the array and the data input variables are applied only to the lowermost array layer. As a result, the network of the present invention can be made functionally redundant while the Yau mux tree can not. Consequently, the Yau mux tree is not fault tolerant. Furthermore, the Yau mux tree does not lend itself to a large number of alternative solutions to a problem which seeks the presentation of a specific Boolean logic function to the input data variables. As a result, unlike the present invention, the Yau mux tree is not suitable to adaptive systems wherein in effect, the network of the present invention can search for and find its own solutions. From US A 3 296 424 a logic gate structure is known comprising a hierarchical array of multivariable input nodes, said nodes having a plurality of control input lines for selecting operation of said nodes in accordance with any one of a plurality of possible Boolean logic functions for a number of data input variables, a plurality of selecting means associated respectively with each such node and being connected to said node control input lines for selecting said node operation. From IEEE transactions on computers, volume C 22, number 4, April 1973, pages 347 388, New York, US A. Maruoka Logical networks of flexible cells a flexible network of multivariable nodes is known, the nodes have two or more inputs and one output and performing any one of a plurality of possible Boolean logic functions for the number of data inputs, the network performs all possible output functions even if the range of flexibility of each node is restricted to some extent. The logic device of the present invention as claimed performs computational logic functions suitable to concurrent or serial logic machines. It applies to any computer application in which reliability and increased production yield is a requirement. It is also particularly amenable to VLSI architectures and full component testability that solves the well known VLSI buried logic problem. One illustrative novel test method for fully testing a particular configuration employing the present invention is disclosed and claimed in patent US A 4 542 508 filed November 21, 1983 by one of the inventors herein and published 17.09.85. The invention is logically flexible in that it has features essential to a learning machine and is adaptable to parallel or serial machines thus overcoming the limitations of fixed logic arrays. The invention is field programmable in that it can be reprogrammed during use to suit the user s application while having none of the computational speed or power consumption penalties of conventional field programmable logic arrays. Furthermore, the invention can be manufactured and completely tested as a standard, high volume VLSI product having the advantages of high speed and low power consumption. More importantly the present invention as claimed comprises a logic device which provides a functionally redundant architecture with a substantially enhanced probability of functionality despite the presence of faults, thus rendering the device more reliable in the field and more likely to provide greater production yields. Furthermore, functional redundancy renders the device suitable for use in adaptable problem solving machines where such problems may be numeric such as mathematical calculations as well as non numeric such as pattern recognition. In one illustrative embodiment of the present invention, the logic structure comprises a combinational logic device in the form of a complete gate structure. The device is a three input gate constructed from six two variable input gates. The device architecture has a regular structure with a hierarchial form. The general purpose quality of the device is derived from the ability of the gate structure to be configurable into all of the possible 256 functions of a three input device. The embodiment is therefore complete in the sense that it can assume any and all possible Boolean functions by a combinational device with up to three inputs. The structure is composed of six two variable input gates called nodes or atoms. Each input gate is identical and is in itself complete. At the two input level, completeness means the ability to recognize all sixteen possible logic functions for two inputs. In this embodiment the multiple logic states that a node or atom may assume are selected by a control structure in the form of a 4 bit control word. When the atom is used as a combinational logic device, a fixed control word establishes the desired function. At this level of control, a simple scheme is available for structuring field programmable logic arrays FPLA with qualities of speed and normal power. On the other hand, conventional FPLA design establishes logical options by incorporating into the data path all of the expected logic options and blowing fuses to select specific options. The resultant loading of the data path by the fuse and logic circuitry degrades performance. The atom maintains a parsimonious data path and appends the control structure. Control structure design is independent of data path quality features. A number of embodiments are disclosed herein comprising three and four input variable networks. In such illustrations of the invention a variety of different configurations are indicated and some of those illustrations include certain preselected architectural simplifications where atoms or nodes in a particular array are either fixed or omitted whereby the total number of control lines is reduced thereby reducing redundancy while maintaining completeness. The potential for use of the present invention in adaptive networks is also discussed herein. It is therefore a principal object of the present invention to provide a combinational logic device which has a functionally redundant architecture for rendering the device fault tolerant thereby increasing reliability and increasing production yields. It is an additional object of the present invention to provide a state machine logic device which comprises a hierarchial array of atoms at least some of which may be reconfigured by the logic states of a plurality of control signals to present in a number of different ways a Boolean logic function to the input variables of the network. It is still an additional object of the present invention to provide a logic gate network having a functionally redundant architecture which renders the network especially suitable for adaptive network systems with non numeric problem solving capabilities. The aforementioned objects and advantages of the present invention as well as additional objects and advantages thereof will be more fully understood hereinafter as a result of a detailed description of preferred embodiments of the invention when taken in conjunction with the following drawings in which Reference will first be made to FIGs. 1 and 2 for a brief description of the prior art considered most relevant to the present invention. More specifically, referring to FIG. 1 it will be seen that a prior art atom 5 comprises a one of four decoder 6 and a four position switch 7. The data input variables X1 and X2 are applied to one of four decoder 6 for the control of switch 7 which connects the output of the prior art atom to a selected one of four control inputs C0 C3. Thus, the selection of control signals C0 C3 determines the relationship between the data variable inputs X1 and X2 and the output of the atom. In FIG. 2 a network of such prior art atoms is shown as having the capability for receiving four input variables X0 X3 and sixteen control inputs C0 C15. As seen in FIG. 2, in this configuration the prior art network consists of five atoms 5 comprising four atoms arrayed as a lower layer and adapted for receiving all of the sixteen control lines and two of the four input variables, namely X2 and X3. Each of the lower layer atoms feeds the control input line to a fifth atom 5 which also receives the remaining two input variables X0 and X1. It will be seen hereinafter that there are a number of differences between the prior art of FIGs. 1 and 2 and the present invention hereinafter disclosed. More specifically, it will be seen that the prior art network is hierarchial in data input while the network of the present invention is hierarchial in control input. Furthermore, of particular importance is the fact that the network of FIG. 2 is non redundant. There are precisely the number of control lines and control circuit paths required to select all the possible Boolean logic functions to render the prior art network of FIG. 2 complete for four input variables. As a result, the prior art network of FIG. 2 lacks the fault tolerant and adaptability features of the present invention as will be hereinafter more fully understood. FIG. 3 is a basic building block or atom 10 of the logic network of the invention. It is a six input device comprising two variable data inputs and four control line inputs. Consequently, it is a complete logic device, meaning that it has the maximum computing power for two input variables. In the symbolic block diagram of FIG. 3 atom 10 comprises a data path 12, a control apparatus 14, a function memory 16 and a test memory 18. Input variables A and B are applied to data path 12 which in turn produces an output Z. The output Z is a Boolean function of the input variables A and B determined in accordance with the output of control apparatus 14. Control apparatus 14 provides four control lines carrying a selected combination of four binary signals which determine the Boolean function of data path with respect to the input variables A and B. The provision of four such control lines from control apparatus 14 permits the application of sixteen binary combinations to data path 12 thereby allowing data path 12 to assume all possible sixteen Boolean functions for two input variables. These sixteen Boolean functions are listed in and represented by the Karnaugh Map shown in Table 1. As seen in FIG. 3 the actual control apparatus output may be controlled by either a function memory 16 or a test memory 18. Typically the function memory 16 places control apparatus 14 in a suitable control mode for providing data path 12 with a selected Boolean function for input variables A and B. However, function memory 16 may be selectively re programmed as required to change the output of control apparatus 14 in accordance with an alternative selection for the Boolean function of data path 12. On the other hand, test memory 18 would typically be provided with capability for cycling control apparatus 14 through all possible control signal combinations in a sequential fashion for the purpose of generating all Boolean functions for data path 12 during a test of the atom 10. Referring to FIG. 4 there is shown therein an illustrative general purpose gate 20 which is a combinational logic device in the form of a complete gate structure. The device is a three variable input gate structured from six two variable input gates or atoms 10. The device architecture has a regular structure with a hierarchial form. The general purpose quality of the device derives from the ability of the gate structure to be configurable into all of the possible 256 truth table values of a three input device. The gate structure 20 is thus complete in the sense that it can assume any and all possible Boolean functions as a combinational device with three inputs. As previously discussed in conjunction with FIG. 3, each two variable input gate or atom 10 is identical and is in itself complete. The bottom tier 24 of atoms 10 comprises three such atoms which are adapted to receive input variables X1, X2 and X3 and provide connection to the next highest tier 26 of two atoms 10 which is in turn connected to a highest tier 28 of a single atom 10. The output signal of single atom 10 comprising tier 28 is f x , a Boolean function of the three input variables X1, X2 and X3. It is to be noted that the right most input line 30 of the right most atom 10 of tier 24 is connected to the left most input line of the left most atom 10 of that tier to provide for three input variables. It is also to be noted that each atom 10 includes provision for four control lines C0, C1, C2 and C3. Each such set of control lines is connected to a source of control code signals. This feature is discussed hereinafter in conjunction with FIG. 5. Reference will now be made to FIGs. 5 8 for a more detailed description of an actual integrated circuit implementation of one illustrative embodiment of the present invention. More specifically, referring first to FIG. 5 it will be seen that the actual implementation of each atom or two variable input gate structure of the present invention comprises a logical unit 40, a decode programmable logic array PLA 42, a static shift register SSR 44, and a two phase clock generator 46. Logic unit 40 is shown in detail in FIG. 6. As seen in FIG. 6 the logic unit 40 is driven by inverting super buffers 50, 52, 54 and 56 and a non inverting super buffer 74 to ensure maximum speed in the input output logic circuit. Each of the inverting input buffers drives the gate of each of two field effect transistors FET . Control signals C0 C3 provide the source voltages and the drains are tied either serially or directly to common input output super buffer 74. In this manner the logic condition of the control signals C0 C3 determines which one of the possible Boolean functions of input variables X1 and X2 will produce the Z output. Thus, for example, if only C0 were in a logical one condition and the remaining control signals were all at logical zero conditions, Z would attain a logic one state only if both X1 and X2 input variables were at a logical one state. Therefore, in this condition, logic unit 40 would act as an AND gate. On the other hand, if control signals C0, C1 and C3 were in a logic one condition and only C2 were in a logic zero condition, the Z output would be in a logic one condition if either X1 or X2 or both were in a logic one condition. Therefore, in this mode of control, logic unit 40 would behave as an OR gate. Whenever the control signals C0 C3 are fixed, the logic unit is the only portion of the atom implicated in signal handling. Control signals for the logic unit 40 are derived from a static shift register 44 and a programmed logic array 42. This combination provides a means to change the control signal and to remember the last signal, thus comprising a form of memory. SSR 44 comprises up to eight register segments and so may be shifted sequentially into eight states by a clock signal CLK. The eight states are decoded by the PLA 42 into sixteen unique signals for sixteen clock transitions by a NAND portion of the PLA. A NOR portion of the PLA 42 converts the sixteen signals out of the SSR 44 into as many four bit binary words that act as the control signals for the logic unit. SSR 44 is a conventional device comprising sixteen inverting super buffers arranged in a ring with the output of the last stage being inverted to be looped back to the SSR input. Each inverter drives an input to the PLA NAND section. In this manner, the SSR provides the needed complements to the eight inverter segments. The pass transistors that operate the register of SSR 44 are clustered at the input to each segment. In this way, the speed of the circuit is improved and the hazard of faulty logic due to capacitive voltage is minimized. The PLA is sparsely populated with transistors i.e., only two per inverter signal 32 total . This low population permits distribution of the transistors toward the drive parts and reduced PLA capacitance. A non overlapping clock utilizes the capacity of two distribution buses CLOCK and NON CLOCK to slow clock transitions in proportion to the chip distributed capacity ensuring that all the register gates are at correct potentials during shifting. This precaution is included to avoid racing in the SSR. The clock generation circuit is a familiar two NOR gate five inverter design. Super buffers are used to drive the clock buses, provide somewhat equal rise and fall times and also facilitate a clock slowdown function. Floor plan drawings of the replicated two input atom 10 incorporating the SSR PLA configuration of FIG. 5 and of an entire chip incorporating two complete gate networks 20 of FIG. 4, are shown respectively in FIGs. 7 and 8. The layout of gate 10 is determined largely by the PLA shape. PLA size is determined by the spacing of the super buffers and switching transistor networks that drive the PLA. The design of the chip floor plan is based upon the replication and interconnection of the basic two input gates in groups of six with two such groups being incorporated on a single chip. The resultant chip size is approximately 4x5 mils including 36 pads. As seen in FIG. 7 the reference numerals applied to the layout of the atom or two input logic gate indicate the correspondence between the floor plan location and the functional block discussed previously in conjunction with FIG. 5. The only portion of the floor plan of FIG. 7 not previously identified comprises a plurality of pull up resistors 48 shown in the lower right hand of that figure. Thus, the floor plan of the two input logic gate generally identified by reference numeral 80 as shown in FIG. 7, comprises four portions which make up the logic unit 40, two portions including a NAND plane and a NOR plane which make up PLA 42, two portions including an upper SSR portion and a lower SSR portion which make up static shift register 44 and a single portion which comprises the two phase clock 46 along with the previously mentioned pull up resistors portion 48. An entire network of gates is shown in FIG. 8 in the layout of a chip 75 wherein the two input gate portion 80 is located in the upper right hand corner of the floor plan of the entire chip. Two input gate 80 forms the upper most hierarchial chip of a first group comprising additional atoms 82, 84, 86, 88 and 90, which, in combination, provide a complete three variable input logic gate structure as shown in FIG. 4. The chip 75 also comprises a second such three variable input gate structure comprising atoms 92, 94, 96, 98, 100 and 102 with atom 92 forming the upper most level of the hierarchial structure of that group. Functional redundancy of a logic network may be defined as the number of control states divided by the number of functions. For complete logic networks, that is for logic networks which are capable of presenting all possible Boolean logic functions for the number of input variables, this ratio may be anywhere in the range of 1 to infinity. In the case of the complete network of FIG. 4 which has a total of 24 control lines, the number of control states is 2 to the power 24 and the number of functions for the three input variables is 256 or 2 to the 8th. Consequently, the redundancy ratio is 2 to the power 16 thereby indicating that the network of FIG. 4 is an extremely redundant configuration. Table II provides a sample listing of the number of possible implementations for 30 of the 256 Boolean functions possible in the network of FIG. 4. As seen in Table I, except for the two trivial cases of a fixed zero or one output irrespective of the input, the number of possible implementations for various truth table functions of the network of FIG. 4 extends into the region between 100,000 and 200,000 such implementations for many of the functions and reduces to a minimum of 2,496 implementations for the least implementable function. Those having skill in the art to which the present invention pertains will in fact perceive that the minimum possible number of implementation schemes for any function in the entire table of 256 Boolean logic functions for the network of FIG. 4 is 2,496. As previously indicated and as will be discussed hereinafter in more detail, redundancy renders the logic network fault tolerant making it more reliable and increasing production yields. However, such redundancy also provides an additional advantage which permits the designer to simplify the network while still retaining the quality of logic completeness. Simplification of logically redundant and complete networks which permit retention of the quality of completeness, may be accomplished in two ways. One way is to fix the logic configuration of some nodes or atoms within an array while retaining some measure of the control of the variation of the remaining nodes. The other way of simplification is to reduce the number of nodes in a particular array and thus reduce the number of control lines and control states. By way of example, FIGs. 9 and 10 both represent a simplified configuration of a three input structure of the present invention wherein redundancy has been reduced to one while the completeness quality of the network has been retained. As seen in FIG. 9, this is accomplished by fixing the uppermost atom of the array in an OR configuration and fixing the two atoms of the second level of the array in an AND and AND NOT configuration, respectively. It is to be noted for purposes of discussion herein that an AND NOT nomenclature refers to an AND gate having an inverter on one input. In some figures, an AND gate having an inverter circle on one leg is used as an alternative nomenclature. Finally, the middle node of the bottom level of the array has been fixed in an exclusive OR configuration and the remaining outside nodes of the bottom layer retain full control capability wherein four control lines and thus 2 to the power 4 control states can still be provided. It will be observed that the completeness of the network has been retained even though completeness of only two of the atoms has been preserved with the remaining atoms having their functional capability reduced to one chosen function. This simplified non redundant but complete configuration of the six atom array for three input variables of the present invention is illustrated in a form of schematic shorthand notation in FIG. 10 wherein the fixed atoms or nodes of the array are represented by the diamond shape cross hatched portion of the network and the total number of control lines is represented by the numeral containing arrow on the right side of the network. The simplification of redundant logic networks of the present invention can also provide networks which are capable of logical completeness for more than three input variables. For example, using the graphical nomenclature of FIG. 10, a four input simplified complete structure utilizing the present invention is illustrated in FIG. 11. As seen in FIG. 11 the four input structure employs a pair of simplified three input structures as well as the fixed node portion of a third three input network with the variable atoms from the third network omitted and only the variable atoms of the simplified complete networks being retained with a total of sixteen control lines. A schematically more complete representation of the four input logic network structure of FIG. 11 is shown in FIG. 12 wherein it is seen that the total structure comprises only four complete two variable input atoms with the remaining atoms being fixed at preselected Boolean functions and no longer requiring control input lines. In the three input simplified configuration of FIGs. 9 and 10 and the four input simplified configuration of FIGs. 11 and 12, the simplification process is made at the expense of redundancy and as a result, both networks remain logically complete but become non redundant with simplification. However, because of the vast redundancy of the basic network of FIG. 4, it is entirely possible to simplify the various building block structures of the present invention at the expense of redundancy but without losing redundancy entirely. The four input network structure configurations of FIGs. 13 and 14 are illustrative of this feature. Thus for example, in FIG. 13 the four input structure is achieved by combining four of the diamond simplifications of FIG. 10 as shown in FIG. 13. Thus the network configuration of FIG. 13 comprises four six node arrays in which in each array the four diamond inclusive atoms are fixed and the two diamond exclusive atoms remain variable with four control input lines. Clearly the configuration of FIG. 13 is complete and redundant as well. The number of possible Boolean logic functions is 2 to the 16th power or 65,536 while the number of control states is 2 to the 32nd power clearly rendering the network of FIG. 13 highly redundant. Thus, it will be seen that the network of FIG. 13 comprises a four input structure in which simplification of the basic logic network of FIG. 4 has been utilized to substantially reduce the complexity of the implementation of the structure but nevertheless the structure remains highly redundant and thus to a degree offers the advantages of fault tolerance and adaptability. An alternative form of simplification for a four input redundant logic structure is shown in FIG. 14. The structure of FIG. 14 utilizes the previously mentioned simplification alternative, namely, reducing the number of atoms without fixing any of the remaining atoms. It is seen that the structure comprises three of the networks of FIG. 4, however, the two outermost lower tier atoms of the upper tier network can be omitted. In this configuration it is seen that the level of redundancy is even greater than the configuration of the four input structure of FIG. 13. More specifically, it is seen that in the configuration of the four input structure of FIG. 14 there are still 2 to the 64 control states using even a higher level of redundancy and therefore increased probability of fault tolerance and a greater level of adaptability. In FIGs. 15 and 16 a four input network structure of the utmost redundancy utilizing the basic network of FIG. 4 is shown. In the configuration of FIGS. 15 and 16 no simplification is provided and implementation for a complete four input network structure is carried out for maximum redundancy using a non redundant but complete two input atom. Thus, it is seen that the present invention provides a logic network in which multi data input configurations may be provided along with a host of various implementations where the level of redundancy may be selected to offer completeness with maximum simplification or completeness with maximum two layer network redundancy or any combination between those limits of completeness. Reference will now be made to FIGs. 17 24 which provide simple illustrative examples of the use of the redundancy of the present invention and the resultant advantages relating to problem solving and fault tolerance. More specifically, referring first to FIG. 17 it will be seen that a three input network of the present invention is provided with a plurality of detectors, one connected to each of the input variable lines to the network. For purposes of clarity, control line structure is not shown in FIG. 17 or in the remaining figures. However, it is to be understood that the control states of each of the atoms of the respective networks have already been selectively sequenced to achieve particular logic functions indicated in order to accomplish a given task. The task of the network shown in FIG. 18 is to detect the 120 degree line illustrated in that figure and only that line. The absence of that line or the presence of additional lines should produce a zero logic output while the presence of the 120 degree line and only that line should produce a logical one output. As seen in FIG. 18 the network has been reprogrammed to accomplish this task. The lower layer of atoms remains the same, namely, three AND gates. However, the second layer of atoms has been altered so that the left atom has been changed to an AND gate with an inverter on its left leg and the right atom has been changed to an AND gate with an inverter on its right leg. In addition, the uppermost atom on the top layer of the network has been changed to an AND gate without inverters. Those having skill in the relevant art will recognize that the particular selection of atom function does indeed accomplish the task assigned to the network of FIG. 18. The task assigned to the networks of FIGs. 19 22 is that of detecting two lines. namely, the 60 degree line or the 120 degree line. The network should generate a logical one at its output only if either one of these lines is present and it should generate a zero at its logical output if both lines are present, if both lines are absent or if the third line, the zero degree line, is present. Those having skill in the relevant art will recognize that each of the networks of FIGs. 19 22 provides a different but acceptable solution to the task at hand and numerous other acceptable solutions will likely occur. This ability of the network of the present invention to provide multiple solutions to the same problem is a direct benefit of the feature of redundancy and illustrates an advantage of this feature. As previously indicated, one such benefit is fault tolerance. A non redundant structure can provide only one solution to the problem and virtually any fault in any atom would render such non redundant structures unsuitable for the problem presented. On the other hand, the redundant structure of the present invention provides a number of different solutions to the same problem. For example, as indicated in FIG. 21, that network utilizes an upper atom which is transparent to the right leg input, a right most second tier atom which is an AND gate configuration, a right most third tier atom which is an exclusive OR configuration, and a middle third tier atom which is in a transparent left leg configuration. The remaining two atoms, namely, the left most atoms of tiers 2 and 3 are in a don t care configuration. Thus, if an attempt was first made to provide a solution, as indicated in figures 19, 20 and 22 and it was determined that a fault existed in the left most atoms of the second and third tiers, or in their interconnections, restructuring of the atom functions by simply varying the control states as needed to present the solution of FIG. 21 would permit use of the network despite the faults noted. Similarly, if the right second tier atom of the network were stuck in the right leg transparent position, the solution of the network shown in FIG. 20 would still provide means for implementing the task assigned to the network by simply revising the control states of the various atoms. Those having skill in the relevant art will no doubt perceive of various other faults which could be tolerated as a result of the multiple solutions shown in FIGs. 19 22 or the additional solutions that they have deduced as a result of the teaching herein. Multiple solutions to the same problem presented to the network also reveal an additional advantage of the redundancy feature of the present invention. More specifically, it will be observed that once the problem of the network has been defined, a network capable of multiple solutions may be given the task of determining its own solution based on a variety of selected criteria utilizing a truth table search routine with the simplest of feedback techniques. A typical criterion might be propagation speed through the network or another might be, overcoming a known fault in the network. Still another criterion might be the optimization of the probability of tolerating a fault in the future without the need for varying control states by minimizing dependency on those atoms or network interconnections which statistically have the highest probability of producing a fault in the field. Irrespective of the criterion used to select a solution to a problem, the capability of having multiple solutions from which to choose in order to provide the same Boolean logic function to a plurality of input variables, is novel. FIG. 23 is provided herein as an illustration of a solution which detects three lines presented to the same network. Those having skill in the relevant art will recognize this as one solution of many which carries out the task of providing a logical one only when any one of the three lines is detected. It will now be recognized that the capabilities for carrying out the tasks discussed above in conjunction with FIGs. 17 23, represent a pattern recognition capability for the three input network configuration of the present invention where such recognition capability is dependent upon the input of three variables from a corresponding number of detectors. It will be understood that more complex pattern recognition functions can be performed by the present invention utilizing architectures configured for additional numbers of inputs. The first step in this increase in the number of inputs is represented in FIG. 24 where a pattern recognition application utilizing four detectors is illustrated. As seen in FIG. 24, two alternative levels of redundancy are indicated depending upon the selected number of control lines and configuration for each of the networks shown in that figure. It will now be understood that the level of redundancy determines the extent of fault tolerance and or problem solving capability for adaptive networks. Clearly, larger, more complex networks with capabilities for five or more input variables and thus more complex pattern recognition applications, as well as other applications, are contemplated within the scope of the present invention. It will now be understood that what has been disclosed herein comprises a logic device which provides a functionally redundant architecture with a substantially enhanced probability of functionality despite the presence of faults thus rendering the device more reliable in the field and more likely to provide greater production yields. Furthermore, functional redundancy renders the device suitable for use in adaptable problem solving machines where problems may be numeric such as mathematical calculations as well as non numeric such as pattern recognition. A number of illustrative embodiments have been disclosed. In one such embodiment the logic structure comprises a combinational logic device in the form of a complete gate structure comprising a three input gate constructed from six two variable input gates. A number of additional embodiments are disclosed comprising three and four input variable networks, each of which is at least initially logically redundant and some of which are shown to undergo simplifications where atoms or nodes of a particular network are fixed or omitted whereby the total number of logical control options has been reduced. The unique functional redundancy feature of the logical architectures of the present invention, including the specific embodiments shown herein, results in a logical device which can be manufactured in the form of VLSI chips and have the advantage of being programmable in the field, have increased production yields, greater reliability, be tolerant of faults, and have the potential of being an important building block for adaptive network systems. Numerous modifications and additions will now occur to those having relevant skill as a result of the teaching disclosed herein. By way of example, it will now be recognized that the advantageous feature of functional redundancy is not necessarily limited to logical networks which are complete. In fact the novel application of functional redundancy results in identical or similar advantages in incomplete networks where redundancy in such instances would have the same definition indicated above, namely, the number of control states divided by the number of functions being greater than 1. The only distinction is that the number of functions would not be determined analytically by merely addressing the number of input variables, but would depend upon the number of functions expected of the device, it being recognized beforehand that the device is not expected to be complete for the particular purposes for which it is utilized. In any case, such additions and modifications, including the concept of functional redundancy in incomplete logic networks, is contemplated as being within the scope of the present invention which is to be limited only by the claims appended hereto.
