# Use of an austenitic steel in oxidizing conditions at high temperature.

## Abstract
Austenitic steel having an excellent resistance to high temperature oxidization. The steel contains carbon up to 0.01 percent, silicium 0.1 5 percent, manganese up to 3 percent, nickel 7 45 percent, chromium 15 30 percent and sulphur 0.003 percent or less. The low content of sulphur 0.003 percent or less, preferably 0.0015 percent or less, makes the steel resistant to oxidization even if exposed to a number of heat cycles between a high temperature and room temperature.
