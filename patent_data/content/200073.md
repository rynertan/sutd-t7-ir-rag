## Description
PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF AMMONIUM PHOSPHATES FROM PHOSPHATES ROCKS The present invention relates to a process for the production of ammonium phosphates starting from phosphate rocks. The treatment is known of the phosphate rocks with strong acids such as, e.g., sulphuric acid, nitric acid, hydrochloric acid. The most commonly used among these is sulphuric acid, which allows converting all calcium contained in the phosphate ore into calcium sulphate, which is then removed by filtering. The reaction in this case is as follows Ca3 POL 2 3 H2SO 6H2O 3 CaSO4 2 H20 2H3PO4 The phosphoric acid solution extracted is then submitted to concentration and subsequent ammoniation. From The Czechoslovakian Patent No. 142533, decomposing the phosphate rocks by means of sulphuric acid and ammonium sulphate in three steps is known as well. In the first step, for the decomposition sulpha ric acid is used, in the second step ammonium sulphate and or ammonium bisulphate, in the third step sulphuric acid is used again. A process for the production of ammonium phosphates has been now surprisingly found, starting from phosphate rocks which are decomposed by means of sulphuric acid and ammonium sulphate under suitable conditions in one reaction step on y, which allows the required amount of treatment agents sulphuric acid and ammonium sulphate to be reduced, at The same time reducing the equipment installation costs. The process being the object of the present invention for the production of ammonium phosphates starting from phosphate rocks, which comprises a step of grinding of said rocks, a chemical attack with sulphuric acid and ammonium sulphate and a filtration of the reaction pulp, is characterized in that the attack is carried out in one single step, under isothermal conditions, at a temperature comprised within The range of from 70 to 90 C. The temperature control the reactions which take place are exothermic can be carried out by surface evaporation in vacuo. The attack of The rocks can be accomplished by means of an equipment provided with such a stirring device as to secure conditions of temperature and of concentrations of The chemical species present and of suspended solids as uniform as possible. The main reaction on which said process iz based is the following CAPO, 2 H2SO4 NH, 2SO, 6 H2O 3 3 CaSO..2H20 2NH4H2PO, The process being the object of the presen invention allows replacing portions of sulphuric acic with ammonium sulphate and saving ammonia compared to the traditional production process through phosphoric acid and the subsequent am moniation thereof. This point is of undoubted finan cial interest if one thinks that presently large amounts are available of ammonium sulphate, ob tained as byproduct from some industria processes e.g., caprolactam production or fron plants for the sequestering of sulphur oxides fron flue gases. Under the conditions of the process, dihydratx calcium sulphate crystallizes off, in an easily sep arable form, which, together with precipitated impu rities and unreacted rock, constitutes the gypsum subsequently removed by filtration and washec with countercurrent water for The recovery of nitro gen and P20s. The process disclosed allows also operating with concentrations of P2Os in the reaction pulf higher than in the known dihydrate processes fo the production of diluted phosphoric acid with re duced formation of hemihydrate calcium suiphat involving filtering difficulties . This element has a positive incidence on th consumption of steam in the step of concentration of the solution produced, when this is processsd t solid fertilizer Moreover, the adaptability has been experi mentaliy demonstrated of the proposed method te the processing of phosphate rocks from differen sources and having different compositions Algerian, Moroccan rocks, and so forth . In these cases, The treatment yield dissolvee P2OJinsoluble P2Os in the rock 1001 reaches in dustrially acceptable values 92 95 . Hereunder some preferable typical parameter of the attack step are reported Granulometry of ground rock 90 200 mesh 0.074 mm Excess of SO, from H2SO, and NH4 2SO4 lowe than or equal to 10 relatively to the stoichiometrically equivalent amount of CaO contained in the rock Residence time of the pulp 2.5 4 hours. Thanks to the treatment process as above mentioned, a pulp is produced which, by separation of the gypsums, yields a partially ammoniated filtrate pH 2 2.5 . This filtrate, when the ammoniation i completed, by the addition of anhydrous ammonia, up to the desired level for MAP, up to pH 4.5 5 , is submitted to traditional operations of fertilizers industry concentration of the solution, pelletizing, drying . The proposed attack process and the subsequent operations can be executed in continuous. The invention shall be now better disclosed with the aid of the flow sheet of attached Figure, showing a preferred embodiment, but which is not to be considered as limitative of the same invention. The phosphate rock 1 is suitably ground in a mill 2 and previously mixed in a pre mixer 3 with a washing solution 4 from which a mixture 5 , which is sent to the rection equipment 6 , is obtained. Sulphuric acid 7 , also in highly concentrated solution, is supplied to the reaction equipment in the point 8 , and is fed by devices of various types sprayers, and so forth , not shown in the flow sheet. Ammonium sulphate 9 is sent to the reaction equipment in the point 10 . When it is available in the solid state, it is previously mixed with the above mentioned washing solution 4 in a premixer 11 . From the top 12 of the reactor,the vapours evolving from the reaction are removed by means of a vacuum system. The reaction pulp 13 is on the contrary first sent into a tank 14 , then filtered on a filter 15 to separate the gypsums 16 . From the pipe 17 the desired solution is drawn. Finally, by the pipe 18 the recycle solution containing nitrogen and P2O5, obtained by countercurrent washing the gypsums with water 19 , is recycled. As an alternative to the above, the phosphate rock and ammonium sulphate can be mixed at the same time with the recycled washing solution and the so obtained mixture is sent to the reaction equipment.Examples 1 2 The results are reported of treatment tests for two types of phosphate rocks 1 Rock from Algerian source low grade, high content in impurities 2 Rock from Moroccan source hlgh grade, iow content in impurities using sulphuring acid and ammonium sul phate as the treatment agents.
