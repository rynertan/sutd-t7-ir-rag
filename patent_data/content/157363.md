## Description
The present invention relates to a silver halide photographic material. More particularly, the invention relates to a silver halide photographic material which uses a specified cyan coupler so as to provide a cyan dye image having improved resistance to discoloration both in light and dark places, thereby achieving a balanced discoloration between yellow, magenta and cyan colors. Silver halide color photographic materials typically comprise a support having formed thereon three silver halide emulsion layers selectively sensitized to have sensitivity to blue, green and red lights. For example, in color negative photographic materials, blue , green and red sensitive silver halide emulsion layers are formed on a support, with the blue sensitive emulsion layer being positioned on the top and closest to a light source for the purpose of exposure. The blue and green sensitive emulsion layers are interposed by a bleachable yellow filter layer which absorbs a blue light transmitted through the blue sensitive emulsion layer. Other intermediate layers that are intended for achieving certain purposes are disposed between each emulsion layer while a protective layer is formed as the outermost layer. In photographic materials used as color papers, red , green and blue sensitive silver halide emulsion layers are formed on a support, with the red sensitive emulsion layer being positioned the closest to a light source for the purpose of exposure. As in color negative photographic materials, a UV absorbing layer and other intermediate layers for achieving various purposes are formed, as well as a protective layer. The emulsion layers may be arranged in different orders, and it is also common for each emulsion layer to be replaced by at least two emulsion layers which have substantially the same sensitive region for a particular light but which have different degrees of sensitivity to such light. With all types of silver halide color photographic materials, aromatic primary amine compounds are typically used as color developing agents so as to develop exposed silver halide grains, and the resulting oxidation product of the color developing agent reacts with a dye forming coupler so as to form a dye image. In order to produce cyan, magenta and yellow dye images, a phenolic or naphtholic cyan coupler, a 5 pyrazolone pyrazolinobenzimidazole, pyrazolotriazole, indazolone or cyanoacetyl magenta coupler and an acylacetamide or benzoylmethane yellow coupler are respectively used. These dye forming couplers are incorporated in sensitive, color photographic emulsion layers. For example the DE A 24 31 480 concerns a light sensitive silver halide color photographic material with three different layers of color sensitive couplers for improving sensitivity. Silver halide photographic materials bearing the dye images thus formed are stored under exposure to light for an extended period and may experience discoloration. The same problem occurs if the photographic materials are stored in a dark place under certain conditions. The first type of discoloration is generally referred to as light discoloration whereas the second type is called dark discoloration . In order to store color photographic materials semipermanently, the degree of light and dark discoloration should be minimized and the overall balance in the discoloration of yellow, magenta and cyan dye images must be held as close as possible to the initial state. However, these three dye images suffer different degrees of light and dark discoloration and, after extended storage, the overall balance in the discoloration of the three colors is upset the quality of the respective dye images is deteriorated. Two different approaches are being taken in the attempts being made to solve this problem one is to develop a new coupler capable of forming a dye image that suffers less discoloration, and the other is to develop a new additive capable of preventing undesired discoloration. Methods using the second approach are characterized by incorporating a UV absorber or forming a UV absorbing filter in a color photographic material. However, in order to provide a satisfactory degree of light fastness with a UV absorber, the latter must be used in a fairly large amount, but then the dye image is considerably stained by the UV absorber or the latter forms a precipitate without being completely dissolved in a high boiling solvent. Another problem is caused by the fact that the UV absorber is degraded if the dye image is exposed to a strong actinic radiation for an extended period, and the deteriorated UV absorber enhances, rather than inhibits, the discoloration of the dye image. The UV absorber is not effective in preventing discoloration resulting from visible light, so anti discoloration agents other than UV absorbers have also been proposed. Among such agents that have a phenolic hydroxyl group or a group that is hydrolyzed to form a phenolic hydroxyl group are bisphenols Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 31256 1973 and 31625 1973 , pyrogallol, gallic acid and esters or acyl derivatives thereof U.S. Patent No. 3,069,262 , 6 hydroxychromans U.S. Patent Nos. 3,432,300 and 3,574,627 , 5 hydroxychroman derivatives U.S. Patent No. 3,573,050 and 6,6 dihydroxy bisspirochromans Japanese Patent Publication No. 20977 1974 . However, some of these agents are entirely ineffective against dark discoloration and, in an extreme case, they enhance such dark discoloration although they can effectively inhibit the light discoloration of a dye image. Other agents retain their intended effects for a certain period but during extended storage of the dye image of interest, their effects are rapidly decreased or lost entirely. A stain problem may also be caused by such anti discoloration agents. Several of such agents are effective against the discoloration of a magenta dye image but they accelerate appreciably the discoloration of a cyan dye image. Considerable effort is also being made in the art to develop new couplers capable of forming dye images that suffer less discoloration. As already mentioned, in order to ensure extended or semi permanent storage of formed yellow, magenta and cyan dye images, they must have a good color balance. Even if these dye images are exposed to light for an extended period or if they are stored in a dark place under a hot and humid condition, they should suffer little or no discoloration. However, the degree of light and dark discoloration varies among yellow, magenta and cyan dye images. As for dark discoloration, a cyan dye image is the most vulnerable, then comes a yellow dye image, and a magenta dye image is most resistant. It is worth a particular mention that the degree of discoloration in the cyan dye image is much greater than in the other dye images. As for light discoloration, the cyan dye image is also the most vulnerable and the magenta dye image is the most resistant, assuming a light source having a high content of UV radiation. It is therefore concluded that in order to retain a good balance in the discoloration of yellow, magenta and cyan colors for an extended period, the light and dark discoloration of a cyan dye image must be reduced to a minimum, and this is why the development of a new type of cyan coupler that is less likely to cause light or dark discoloration is strongly desired. Conventional cyan couplers such as those shown in Japanese Unexamined Published Patent Application Nos. 37425 1972, 10135 1975, 25228 1975, 112038 1975, 117422 1975, 130441 1975, and U.S. Patent Nos. 2,369,929, 2,423,730, 2,434,272, 2,474,293 and 2,698,794 easily suffer both light and dark discolorations, and color photographic materials bearing cyan dye images produced from these couplers cannot be stored for an extended period without upsetting the overall balance in the discoloration of yellow, magenta and cyan colors. In order to solve this problem, various other cyan couplers have been studied and 2,5 diacylamino compounds have recently come to be used see U.S. Patent No. 2,895,826 and Japanese Unexamined Published Patent Application Nos. 112038 1975, 109630 1978 and 163537 1980 . Cyan couplers made of these compounds have an appreciably improved resistance to dark discoloration but are still unsatisfactory in terms of resistance to light discoloration. The EP A 0 142 086 concerns light sensitive color photographic material, comprising a support and at least three layers of light sensitive silver halide emulsions with different spectral sensitivity. The layers contain a red, a green and a blue sensitive silver halide emulsion together with the appropriate coupler. This prior art is cited according to Art. 54 para 3 EPC. Therefore, one object of the present invention is to provide a silver halide photographic material that retains a good balance in the discoloration of yellow, magenta and cyan dye images even if the material is stored either under prolonged exposure to light or in a dark place, and which hence exhibits dye images of good quality over an extended period of storage. Another object of the present invention is to provide a silver halide photographic material that incorporates a cyan coupler capable of producing a cyan dye image having improved resistance to both light and dark discolorations. A further object of the present invention is to provide a silver halide photographic material that forms a cyan dye image having an appreciably improved resistance to both light and dark discolorations and which hence displays a good overall balance among the yellow, magenta and cyan colors even if the material is exposed to light or is left in a hot and humid atmosphere for an extended period.

Dispersions of the non diffusing couplers for use in the silver halide photographic material of the present invention may be prepared by known methods such as by dispersing them in an aqueous alkali, a solid, a latex or in an oil in water emulsion. A suitable method may be selected depending upon the chemical structure of the non diffusing coupler of interest. For the purposes of the present invention, dispersion in a latex or an oil in water emulsion is particularly effective. Both techniques are well known in the art. The method of dispersing in a latex and the resulting advantages are shown in Japanese Patent Application Nos. 74538 1974, 59943 1976, 32552 1979, and Research Disclosure, August, 1976, No. 14850, pp. 77 79. Latices suitable for use are homopolymers, copolymers and terpolymers of such monomers as styrene, ethyl acrylate, n butyl acrylate, n butyl methacrylate, 2 acetoacetoxyethyl methacrylate, 2 methacryloyloxy ethyl trimethyl ammonium methosulfate, sodium 3 methacryloyloxy propane 1 sulfonate, N isopropylacrylamide, N 2 2 methyl 4 oxopentyl acrylamide and 2 acrylamido 2 methylpropanesulfonic acid. Dispersing in an oil in water emulsion may be accomplished by the known method of preparing a dispersion of a hydrophobic additive such as a coupler. For example, the coupler of interest is dissolved in a high boiling organic solvent with a boiling of about 175 C or more, optionally together with a low boiling solvent. The resulting solution is mixed with an aqueous solution of a hydrophilic binder such as gelatin in the presence of a surfactant, thereby forming finely dispersed particles of the coupler. The so prepared dispersion is added to a hydrophilic colloidal layer. This process is hereunder described in more details. A high boiling solvent is first provided. This solvent is selected from among organic acid amides, carbamates, esters, ketones and urea derivatives, and particularly suitable solvents are phthalic acid esters such as dimethyl phthalate, diethyl phthalate, dipropyl phthalate and dibutyl phthalate, or phosphoric acid esters such as trimethyl phosphate, triethylphosphate, tripropyl phosphate and tricresyl phosphate. The coupler is dissolved in one of these high boiling solvents, optionally together with a low boiling solvent such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, propyl acetate, butyl acetate, butyl propionate, cyclohexanol, cyclohexanetetrahydrofuran, methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, dioxane, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, diethylene glycol monoacetate, acetylacetone, nitromethane, nitroethane, carbon tetrachloride and chloroform. Such high boiling and low boiling solvents may be used either alone or in admixture with themselves. Subsequently, the resulting solution is mixed with an aqueous solution of a hydrophilic binder such as gelatin in the presence of an anionic surfactant such as alkylbenzenesulfonic acid or alkylnaphthalenesulfonic acid and or a nonionic surfactant such as sorbitan sesquioleic acid ester or sorbitan monolauric acid ester. The mixture is then dispersed in a high speed mixer, colloid mill or an ultrasonic disperser, and the so prepared dispersion is incorporated in an emulsion layer. The emulsion layer may also contain other hydrophobic compound such as hydroquinone derivatives, UV absorbers, and anti discoloration agents. Each of the silver halide emulsion layers in the silver halide photographic material of the present invention may have incorporated therein any of the silver halides that are commonly employed in silver halide photographic materials, such as silver chloride, silver bromide, silver iodide, silver chlorobromide, silver iodobromide and silver chloroiodobromide. These silver halides may be used either as coarse or as fine grains, and the grain size distribution may be narrow or broad. The silver halide grains may be normal crystals or twins, with the proportions of 100 and 111 planes being selected at suitable values. The crystals of the silver halide grains may have a homogeneous internal structure, or they may have different internal and surface structures. The silver halides may be of such a type that a latent image is principally formed on the surface or of such a type that the image is formed within the grain. Such silver halide grains may be prepared by any of the methods known in the art. The silver halide emulsions used in the silver halide photographic material of the present invention are preferably freed of soluble salts, but those from which no soluble salts have been removed may also be used. Two or more silver halide emulsions may be separately prepared and later mixed for incorporation in the silver halide photographic material of the present invention. Known binders may be used in the silver halide emulsion layers, as well as in non sensitive layers. Binders that can be used with advantage include gelatin, and gelatin derivatives such as phenylcarbamylated gelatin, acylated gelatin, and phthalated gelatin. These binders may be used as a mixture of two or more miscible compounds. The silver halide emulsion having silver halide grains dispersed in a binder solution may be sensitized with a chemical sensitizer. Chemical sensitizers that can be used with advantage in the present invention are classified as noble metal sensitizers, sulfur sensitizers, selenium sensitizers and reduction sensitizers. Usable noble metal sensitizers include gold compounds, as well as ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, iridium and platinum compounds. Gold compounds may be used in combination with ammonium thiocyanate and sodium thiocyanate. Suitable sulfur sensitizers are activated gelatin and sulfur compounds. Illustrative selenium sensitizers are activated and inactive selenium compounds. Exemplary reduction sensitizers include stannous salts, polyamine, bisalkylaminosulfide, silane compounds, iminoaminomethanesulfinic acid, hydrazinium salts and hydrazine derivatives. Besides the additives shown above, the silver halide photographic material of the present invention may have incorporated therein any useful photographic addenda such as a stabilizer, development accelerator, hardener, surfactant, anti fouling agent, lubricant, DIR compound, and a brightener. The silver halide photographic material of the present invention may also use a backcoat in addition to the silver halide emulsion layers and non sensitive layers. Examples of the support that can be used in the present invention include baryta paper, polyethylene coated paper, synthetic polypropylene paper, a transparent support with a reflective layer or a reflector, glass plate, a polyester film made of cellulose acetate, cellulose nitrate or polyethylene terephthalate, polyamide film, polycarbonate film, and a polystyrene film. A suitable support is properly selected depending upon the specific use of the silver halide photographic material prepared according to the present invention. The silver halide photographic material of the present invention is treated for color development by the usual method. First, the material is treated with a color developer containing a color developing agent. Alternatively, the sensitive material containing a color developing agent or a precursor therefor is treated with an activator solution. The so treated material is subjected to bleaching and fixing steps by the conventional method. The three steps, ie, color development with a color developer or an activator solution, bleaching and fixing, may be performed independently alternatively, two or more steps may be accomplished by a single bath composed of a processing solution capable of fulfilling the respective functions. For example, bleaching and fixing agents of the types described later in this specification may be incorporated in the color developer or activator solution to make up a monobath. Alternatively, the color developed photographic material may be processed with a bleach fixing bath containing both bleaching and fixing agents. Following the treatment with the color developer or activator solution, the photographic material may be immediately treated with a bleach fixing bath for desilvering purposes. If desired, an acid stopping step may be inserted between color development and bleaching, and between bleaching and fixing steps. An acid stop bath may be composed of an aqueous solution of acetic acid or citric acid. If necessary, additional steps may be included, such as prehardening, neutralization, washing and stabilizing steps. As a result of the color development processing shown above, a dye image is formed on the light sensitive printing material because of the coupling reaction. The color developing agent suitable for use with the silver halide photographic material of the present invention is typically made of aromatic primary amine compounds, which include aminephenol and p phenylenediamine derivatives. These compounds are used either in the free state or as salts thereof with organic acids such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, p toluenesulfonic acid, tetraphenylboric acid and p t octyl benzenesulfonic acid. Specific examples of the aromatic primary amine compounds suitable for use as color developing agent in the present invention include o aminophenol, p aminophenol, 5 amino 2 oxytoluene, 2 amino 3 oxytoluene, 2 oxy 3 amino 1,4 dimethylbenzene, N,N diethyl p phenylenediamine hydrochloride, N methyl p phenylenediamine hydrochloride, N,N dimethyl p phenylenediamine hydrochloride, N ethyl N β methanesulfonaminoethyl 3 methyl 4 aminoaniline and sulfate salt thereof, N ethyl N β hydroxyethylaminoaniline, N N diethyl 3 β methanesulfonamidoethyl 4 aminoaniline hydrochloride, 4 amino N 2 methoxyethyl N ethyl 3 methylaniline p toluenesulfonate salt, N ethyl N β methanesulfonamidoethyl 3 methyl 4 aminoaniline tetraphenyl borate salt, 4 amino N 2 methoxyethyl N ethyl 3 methylaniline tetraphenyl borate salt, p morpholinoaniline, p piperidinoaniline, and 4 amino N,N diethyl 3 chloroaniline. The silver halide photographic material of the present invention may optionally contain a precursor for the color developing agent shown above. The precursor is a compound that is capable of forming the color developing agent of interest under alkaline conditions, and illustrative examples include a Schiff base with an aromatic aldehyde derivative, polyvalent metal ion complex, phthalylimide derivative, phosphorylamide derivative, sugar amine reaction product, and urethane. More specific examples of the precursors for aromatic primary amine color developing agents are shown in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,342,599, 2,507,114, 2,695,234, 3,719,492, British Patent No. 803,783, Japanese Unexamined Published Patent Application Nos. 135628 1978, 79035 1979, and Research Disclosure Nos. 15159, 12146 and 13924. The aromatic primary amine compounds shown above are typically contained in the color developer in an amount of 1 20 g 1,000 ml. If they are incorporated in the photographic material as precursors, their amount ranges from 0.5 to 3 mols per mol of silver halide. The color developer or activator solution used with the silver halide photographic material of the present invention may contain an alkali agent such as potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, tertiary sodium phosphate, or tertiary potassium phosphate a sulfite such as sodium sulfite or potassium sulfite or a bromide such as sodium bromide, potassium bromide or ammonium bromide. Other additives that may also be incorporated in the color developer or activator solution include known development restrainers, thiocyanates such as sodium thiocyanate, potassium thiocyanate and ammonium thiocyanate chlorides such as ammonium chloride, potassium chloride, and sodium chloride organic solvents such as ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, methanol, ethanol, n butanol, benzyl alcohol, acetone, and dimethylformamide amines such as hydroxylamine, ethanolamine, ethylenediamine, and diethanolamine water softeners such as sodium hexametaphosphate, sodium tripolyphosphate, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid and water soluble brighteners. The color developer or activator solution may also contain an auxiliary developer. A preferred auxiliary developer is a 1 aryl 3 pyrazolidone derivative which is typically used in an amount of 1 mg to 1 g, preferably from 10 mg to 500 mg, in 1,000 ml of the color developer or activator solution. Typical auxiliary developers include 1 phenyl 3 pyrazolidone, 4 methyl 1 phenyl 3 pyrazolidone, 4,4 dimethyl 1 phenyl 3 pyrazolidone, 4 methyl 4 hydroxymethyl 1 phenyl 3 pyrazolidone and 4 methyl 4 hydroxymethyl 1 p tolyl 3 pyrazolidone. The color developer or activator solution used for the photographic material according to the present invention is held alkaline by a conventional method, and the concentration of hydroxyl ions in the developer or activator solution may be properly selected depending upon the type, composition, object and use of the photographic material under processing of the present invention. Typically, the color developer or activator solution has a pH in the range of 9.5 to 13.5. The color developer or activator solution is typically used within a certain temperature range, which is properly selected depending upon the type, composition, object and use of the photographic material under processing. The preferred temperature range is from 15 to 70 C, with the range of 30 to 50 C being more preferred. Known compounds may be used as a bleaching agent in the bleaching or bleach fixing bath, and suitable examples are aminopolycarboxylic acid iron III complex salts such as EDTA sodium iron III salt and EDTA ammonium iron III salt and persulfate salts such as ammonium persulfate and sodium persulfate. Known compounds may also be used as a fixing agent in the fixing or bleach fixing bath, and suitable examples are thiosulfate salts such as sodium thiosulfate and ammonium thiosulfate water soluble sulfur containing diols such 3,6 dithia 1,8 octanediol and 3,6,9,12 tetrathia 1,14 tetradecanediol and water soluble sulfur containing dibasic acids or salts such as ethylene bis thioglycolic acid and sodium ethylene bis thioglycolate. The advantages of the present invention are hereunder described in greater detail by reference to working examples, to which the present invention is by no means limited. Multi color photographic elements were prepared by forming the following layers on a support made of polyethylene coated paper, with the first layer positioned closest to the support. A yellow coupler containing blue sensitive silver chlorobromide 90 mol silver bromide emulsion layer coated to give a gelatin deposition of 2 g m² this layer contained 300 g of gelatin per mol of silver halide, as well as 0.5 mol, per mol of silver halide, of one of the yellow couplers in Table 1 or comparative coupler Y A shown below, which were dispersed as a dibutyl phthalate solution. First intermediate layer gelatin layer with a gelatin deposition of 1.5 g m² . A magenta coupler containing green sensitive silver chlorobromide 80 mol silver bromide emulsion layer coated to give a gelatin deposition of 2 g m² this layer contained 400 g of gelatin per mol of silver halide, as well as 0.3 mol, per mol of silver halide, of one of the magenta couplers shown in Table 1 that were dispersed as a dibutyl phthalate solution. Second intermediate layer containing a UV absorber in this layer, UV absorber, UV 1 shown below, was dispersed in gelatin as a solution in 20 g of dibutyl phthalate, and its coating thickness was such that the UV absorber and gelatin deposits were 0.6 g m² and 1.5 g m², respectively. A cyan coupler containing red sensitive silver chlorobromide 80 mol silver bromide emulsion layer coated to give a gelatin deposit of 20 g m² this layer contained 300 g of gelatin per mol of silver halide, as well as 0.4 mol, per mol of silver halide, of one of the cyan couplers in Table 1 or comparative cyan couplers C A and C B shown below, which were dispersed as a dibutyl phthalate solution Protective layer gelatin layer with a gelatin deposit of 1.5 g m² . Sample Nos. 1 11 thus prepared were exposed through an optical wedge with a sensitometer Model KS 7 of Konishiroku Photo Industry Co., Ltd. and were thereafter subjected to the following steps. The following formulations were used in the steps of color development and bleach fixing. Oxidation reduction potential 70 mV. The gray dye images formed on the respective samples as a result of the photographic processing were checked for their resistance to light and dark discolorations by the following tests. The samples were left for 2 weeks in a chamber controlled at 770C and 40 r.h. The percent changes from the blue, green and red densities 1.0 of the gray dye image in each sample were measured as in 1 . The results are also listed in Table 1 in the column of Dark discoloration . Comparative cyan coupler, C A U.S. Patent No. 2,423,730 As Table 1 shows, sample No. 1 using comparative cyan coupler C A had a very low resistance to dark discoloration. Sample No. 2 using comparative cyan coupler C B had an improved resistance to dark discoloration but its resistance to light discoloration was not satisfactory. As a result, sample No. 1 did not have a good balance in dark discoloration while sample No. 2 did not have a good balance in light discoloration. Both samples were poor in their overall ability to keep dye images of good quality. Sample No. 3 using comparative yellow coupler Y A did not have a good balance in either light or dark discoloration, and hence its overall ability to keep dye images of good quality was also low. Sample Nos. 4 to 11 using the yellow, magenta and cyan couplers produced cyan dye images which had a particularly great improvement in resistance to both light and dark discolorations. Therefore, these samples according to the present invention displayed a good balance in discoloration between cyan, magenta and yellow colors, and they had an improved overall ability to keep dye images of good quality. Sample Nos. 12 to 21 were prepared as in Example 1 except that the sixth layer was underlaid with a non sensitive layer containing 0.3 g m² of UV absorber UV 1 that was coated to give a gelatin deposit of 1.5 g m². These samples were checked for their resistance to light and dark discolorations as in Example 1. The results are shown in Table 2. As Table 2 shows, Sample Nos. 12 to 14 using comparative cyan couplers C A and C B and which had a protective layer formed on the UV absorbing layer exhibited some improvement in resistance to light discoloration, but their overall balance in discoloration between cyan, magenta and yellow colors was still poor. On the other hand, sample Nos. 15 to 22 according to the present invention had an improved resistance to light discoloration and their overall balance in discoloration in the three colors was satisfactory. In addition, they retained the high resistance to dark discoloration possessed by sample Nos. 4 to 11 prepared in Example 1. Therefore, these samples according to the present invention had a good balance in both light and dark discolorations between cyan, magenta and yellow colors, and hence they displayed an improved overall ability to keep dye images of good quality. Sample Nos. 23 to 26 were prepared as in Example 2 except for the fifth layer. The fifth layer comprised a cyan coupler containing red sensitive silver chlorobromide 70 mol silver bromide emulsion layer coated to give a gelatin deposit of 20 g m2 this layer contained 300 g of gelatin per mol of silver halide, as well as 0.4 mol, per mol of silver halide, of cyan coupler C 2 dissolved in dibutyl phthalate and dispersed in gelatin and 35 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of cyan coupler, of the dye image stabilizer as in Table 3. The processed samples 23 to 26 were tested for light and dark discoloration under the same conditions as in Example 1 except that, for light discoloration, the samples were exposed to a xenon fade meter for 9 weeks and, for dark discoloration, the samples were left alone for 4 weeks in a chamber kept at constant temperature and moisture. The results are shown in Table 3. As Table 3 shows, the samples of the present invention, even when exposed to light for a prolonged period, retain a good balance in the discoloration of yellow, magenta and cyan dye images, and are superior in the overall retention of dye images.
