## Description
ELECTRIC CABLES This invention relates to electric cables for service at very high voltages and incorporating alkene polymer film especially polypropylene or highdensity polyethylene as part of the insulation.Such film may, and preferably does, form part of a laminate having surface layers of cellulosic paper. At the highest voltages for which insulated cables are currently made around 400 500 kV oilimprenated paper insulation maintained under hydraulic pressure is used without exception, but dielectric losses increase rapidly with voltage, and it is clear that different materials will be required if further significant voltage increases are to be achieved.Alkene polymers, and especially polypropylene and polyethylene, are attractive as partial or if possible total replacements for paper as they have very low loss tangents and good impulse behaviour and are not unduly expensive. They are, however, susceptible to swelling on contact with all the conventional hydrocarbon insulating oils, with a consequent risk that the film will become so tightly wound on the cable core that the cable cannot be wound on a drum for deli7ery to site or if impregnated in a wound condition cannot be unwound , or cannot be moved for repointing or repair after service, without risk of damage to the film and consequent failure in fact, in some cases tensions induced by swelling in experimental cables have been so great as to cause fracture of the laminate. We have previously shown that this tendency can be controlled by using a carefully chosen paper polymer paper laminate in combination with a carefully chosen oil, and our British patent specifications numbers 1311867 and 1458422 disclose cables in accordance with the prior art portion of Claim 1. Although satisfactory and useful high voltage cables can be made in this way, we have subsequently found that the characteristics of the oil and the paper, and the conditions of lamination, need to be very closely regulated if a cable with good and consistent properties is to be obtained. We have now found a group of hydrocarbon oils that have electrical properties that compare favourably with the insulating mineral oils and alkylbenzene oils conventionally used in the cable industry and that swell alkene polymers to a significantly smaller extent, thus allowing a higher operating temperature and or providing a useful margin of safety that allows reasonable variations in paper quality and laminating conditions to be accomodated. The invention is characterised by the use of an insulating liquid comprising an aryl alkane having at least two separate uncondensed benzene rings and from one to six aliphatic non cyclic carbon atoms per benzene ring, one or more of which carbon atoms may be present in one or more hydrocarbon substituents in one or both of the benzene rings, the benzene rings or two of them being separated by not more than two aliphatic carbon atoms. Preferably the aryl alkane has a viscosity less than 57 centistokes at 200C and less than 11 centistokes at 600C. It is very desirable, and may be essential if a sufficient control of swelling is to be obtained to allow winding and unwinding of the cable, for the alkene polymer film to be present solely as a laminate, preferably prestressed by extrusion bonding, having two layers of cellulosic paper forming the exposed surfaces of the laminate. This also assists in resisting degradation, if, under overvoltage conditions, electrical discharges should occur in the gaps between the edges of lapped tapes. The aryl alkane or a mixture of aryl alkanes may be used as the sole impregnant, or may be mixed with other suitable impregnants. In particular, they may be mixed with suitable mineral oils, preferably having a viscosity less than 57 centistokes at 20 0C and less than 11 centistokes at 600C, to reduce cost, or with diorganosiloxamer silicone oils, in accordance with our British patent no. 1515847, to improve swelling performance still further. Aryl alkanes that are already commercially available include l phenyl 1 3,4 dimethylphenyl ethane or l phenyl l xylyl ethane , sold by Mitsui Co., under the designation Nisseki Condenser Oil S diphenyl methane 1,2 diphenylethane and mono isopropyl biphenyl mixed isomers .The first of these, hereinafter for convenience calledPXE, is particularly attractive because it has excellent electrical properties, in some respects better than conventional cable oils.

The paper layers are preferably of low density, to secure a low overall power factor and permittivity, but on the other hand, they should be of a fine and uniform structure with a high impermeability, preferably at least 10,000 Gurley seconds. The dielectric may consist of laminate tape, or it may include also a layer or layers of paper tape.In particular, it is desirable for the dielectric to include thin inner and outer layers of paper only, preferably each of these layers consisting of two paper tapes exactly, in accordance with our British patent no. 1442634. The invention will be further described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a cross section of a cable, and Figure 2 is an enlarged detail of part of the dielectric. In Figure 1, 1 indicates a steel tape helix defining a central oil duct within the metallic conductor 2. Over the conductor is applied a bronze binder tape 3 and a conductor screen 4 formed of tapes metallised and or loaded with. conductive material.The dielectric is made up of an inner layer 5 consisting of two paper tapes each 75 micrometres thick a main body 6 and a thin outer layer 7 made up of two paper tapes each 100 micro metres thick. The cable is completed by a semiconductive dielectric screen 8, conductive bedding tape 9 made of copper wires and textile threads or glass fibres woven together , lead or aluminium sheath 10, bronze tape 11 or other pressure resisting reinforcement and a plastics oversheath 12.The dielectric is impregnated with 100 commercial PXE maintained at a minimum pressure of 20 kN m The main dielectric body is made up of three parts, 6a, 6b and 6c, each of which is made up of a large number of extrusion bonded laminate tapes each comprising a polypropylene layer sandwiched between and bonded to two paper tapes. In the inner part 6a, the polypropylene layer is 50 micrometres thick and each paper layer 25 micrometres in the middle part 6b the polypropylene layer 60 micrometres and each paper layer 30 micrometres and in the outer part 6c the polypropylene layer 80 micrometres and each paper layer 40 micrometres. The parts 6a and 6b each have a radial thickness of 5mum the outer part may have a radial thickness of 5mm to give a voltage rating of 400kV, or of 14mm to give a voltage rating of 750V. Figure 2 illustrates, for either of these cables, the layers of laminate tape, each tape comprising a centre layer 13 of polypropylene and outer layers 14 of paper. Butt spaces 15 between tape edges are filled with the PXE. The benefits of the invention are illustrated by a test in which an extrusion bonded prestressed laminate with a central layer 13 of propylene homopolymer with a melt flow index of 6 at 2300C and 2.16 Kg load sold by Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd.under the designation PXC 3391 50 micrometres thick and surface layers 14,14 of cellulosic kraft coilwinding paper with a density of 0.75 Mg m3 and a minimum impermeability of 10,000 Gurley seconds, each layer 25 micrometres thick, were exposed to four different insulating oils at 850C and the swelling 2 measured at a constant interfacial pressure of 0.5 MN m in the way described by Drage Secrett and Reynolds in a paper entitled Compatibility of Liquids andPolymers in Mixed E.E.V. Dielectrics appearing in the annual report of the NAS NRC Conference onElectrical Insulation and Dielectric Phenomena 1970, pages 100 106, the relevant Dart being on pages 101 102.Each of these oils produced an initial temporary reduction in thickness followed by swelling to a final thickness greater than the original, and swelling was calculated separately on the basis of 1 original dry thickness and 2 minimum thickness.
