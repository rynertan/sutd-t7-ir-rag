# Processed soybean foods and their production.

## Abstract
A fibrous or granular processed soybean food can be pro duced by coating the surfaces of fibrous or granular soybean preparation obtained by grinding soybeans having a water con tent of 30 to 60 with one or more members selected from the group consisting of fish paste, cheese and egg in the form of an aqueous slurry. Since said soybean food has been given a good flavor, taste and texture, it can be appropriately used as an ingredient in a variety of foods or as a snack food.
