## Description
This invention relates to a water level control device, particularly for controlling the water level in the tank of a flush toilet. As is known, the devices for filling a wallmounted tank for flush toilets with water to a determined level generally comprise a lift rod or arm and related float, which serves the function of shutting and opening the water inlet port as well as of determining the water level to be reached within the tank or reservoir. Such known devices, while having a variety of different designs and constructions, have in common the feature of unavoidably causing a progressive reduction of the water flow rate as the water level approaches its full limit. This is due to the fact that the water, in acting on the float whereto the rod is attached, urges the float upwards and brings the seal of the shutter provided on said rod closer to the water inlet port, thus gradually throttling down the water flow rate until no more water is admitted. In many cases, this is also the source of an annoying whistling noise, due to the gradual restriction of the water inlet port, which stops after the tanS has been completely filled. It thus occurs in such devices that the force applied to the shutter to close the inlet port is a direct function of the buoyancy force of the float in combination with the lever arm provided by the float rod thus, in order to achieve an adequate shutting force, it becomes necessary to use a float rod of comparatively great length such as to develop the required shutting force, thereby the flush tanks or reservoirs must be given an extended width configuration to allow for the float rod swinging movement clearance. Another shortcoming is that possible pressure surges in the water supply system adversely affect the shutting operation, because it may happens that an increased delivery pressure overcomes the shutting force developed by the shutter. This invention sets out to eliminate such drawbacks affecting the conventional devices,by providing a water level control device, particularly for controlling the water level in the tank of a flush toilet, which allows the length of the float rod to be reduced considerably without, of course, prejudice for a tight sealed shutting action whenever required. Within that general aim, it is possible to arrange that the device according to the invention provides a flushing tank filling cycle which takes place in a uniform manner without applying any restriction to the flow rate towards the end thereof, but rather providing a shutting action which may be defined as instantaneous. It is further possible to arrange that the device of this invention can do practically without a conventional float by using in its stead an element which merely functions to drive the shutting and opening phases of the water inlet control shutter. It is further possible to provide that the device of this invention, in the event of a pressure increase in the water supply system, produces no decrease of the liquid tight sealing action, and rather an increase of the shutter sealing action. It is further possible for the device according to this invention to be simple construction wise, to require no special or complex maintenance, and to be assembled in an extremely quick and simple manner. According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a water level control device, particularly for controlling the water level in the tank of a flush toilet, characterized in that it comprises a body associable with the flushing tank of a flush toilet and defining a chamber therein ,in communication with a water inlet conduit,said chamber accommodating a shutter operative to control a water inlet port in said tank, said shutter being movable from a first or open position, whereat said water inlet port is unc.overed, to a second or closed position, whereat it closes said water inlet port and is held in position by the pressure of the water contained in said chamber, and or viceversa, there being also provided level adjusting means operative on said shutter in said second position, and opening means operative on said shutter from the outside of said chamber and adapted for moving said shutter to said first position when the water in said tank is at a lower level than a pre set level. Further features and advantages will be more clearly apparent from a description of some preferred but not limitative embodiments of this water level control device, particularly for controlling the water level in the tank of a flush toilet, with reference to the accompanying exemplary drawings, where Figure 1 shows, in a schematical form, the device according to this invention as applied to a flush toilet flushing tank or reservoir Figure 2 illustrates a first embodiment of the device, shown in its closed or shut position Figure 3 is a partly sectional view of the first embodiment of this invention, with the device in its open position Figure 4 is a schematical detail view, in section, of the device shutter element, according to the first embodiment of this invention Figure 5 is an exploded view of the shutter Figure 6 is a side view of the first embodiment of this invention s device Figure 7 illustrates a second embodiment of this device, shown in its closed position Figure 8 illustrates the second embodiment of this device, but shown in its open position Figure 9 illustrates a third embodiment of this device, shown in its open position and Figure 10 illustrates the third embodiment of this device, shown in its closed position. Making reference to the cited drawing figures, and in particular to Figures 1 to 6, the water level control device particularly for controlling the water level in the tank of a flush toilet comprises, according to the invention, a body 1 which can be associated with the inside of a tank or reservoir 2 and defines a chamber 3 therein,which communicates with a water inlet conduit 4, generally connected to the water supply system. Within said chamber 3, there is provided a shutter, indicated at 5, which has a rocker arm type of configuration the pivot whereof is provided at an O ring 6 located at a middle portion of the rocker arm type of shutter and ensuring a tight seal with the bottom 7 of the chamber 3 which is secured to the body 1 through a locking nut 8. he end which carries the shutter 5, and having a certain weight, has a sealing or gasket member 10 which controls a water inlet port 11 within the tank 2. To the rocker arm shutter, on the opposite side to the shutter 5 and externally to the chamber 3, there is connected an adjustable counterweight comprising a cylindrical container 20 which is connected, through a string 21, to the rocker arm shutter and is inserted into a cylindrical body 22 carried, through a bracket frame 23, by the body 1 itself at a lower level than the attachment point of the body 1. For reasons which will be apparent hereinafter, said container 20 is provided with a hole 24 at the bottom, whilst the cylindrical body 22 has at the bottom a float operated shutter 25 having the function of providing a tight sealed closure on the bottom of the cylindrical body 22 in conditions which will be explained hereinafter. The cylindrical body 22 has at the top a leadin opening 26 which facilitates the introduction of water into the cylindrical container 20. The cited container 20, in cooperation with the cylindrical body 22, constitutes the means for controlling the level of the water within the tank, the means for opening the shutter comprising a weight, indicated at 30, having a lower specific gravity than the water contained in the tank, which is supported by a stem 31 arranged to slide vertically with respect to the bracket frame 23. The stem 31 is articulated at the top, through a clevis type of oint , to a small connecting rod 32 hinged at a middle portion thereof to a lug 33 of the frame 23 and acting with its free end against the outermost end of the rocker arm shutter to cause the shutter 5 to open in conditions which will be explained hereinafter. The device just described operates as follows.After the water contained in the tank has been discharged, the weight of the shutter 5 overcomes the action of the adjustable counterweight, thus moving into its open position to admit water into the tank. As the water level raises in the tank, when the float operated shutter 25 level is reached, the water displaces the float operated shutter 25 to shut the bottom of the cylindrical body 22 also, as the water level raises, the weight 30, which has, as mentioned,a lower specific gravity than water, moves upwards to bring the connecting rod 32 to a position of non interference with the outer end of the rocker arm shutter. As water continues to flow in, when the water level reaches the upper edge of the cylindrical body 22, the overflow fills the container 20, thereby the latter acquires a certain weight and overcomes the weight of the shutter 5, thus biasing the shutter element oppositely until it causes the shutter 5, and accordingly the seal 1p, to shut the port 11. At this stage, the delivery pressure of the water supply system takes over and holds the seal 10 firmly in the closed position to shut off the flow of water. It should be noted, here, that the displacement of the shutter element from the first or open position to the second or closed position occurs almost instantaneously, thus preventing the emission of a whistling noise and the flow rate slowing down which are typical of conventional such devices. It should be further added that the floatoperated shutter 25 functions to tightly close the bottom of the cylindrical body 22 to allow the container 20 to acquire additional weight by filling with water, thereby accomplishing the position shift of the rocker arm shutter in fact, if the container 20 were immersed in the liquid, it would obviously be unable to operate as a shutting element. When it is desired to control it to open, the flushing tank discharge is operated, in a conventional manner, to flush the toilet as the water level drops, the weight 30 moves downwards to rotate, this time in the opposite direction, the connecting rod 32 which by acting on the free end of the rocker arm shutter, returns it instantaneously to the open position and the liquid is allowed to enter the tank. It should be noted that the water previously introduced into the container 20 flows out through the hole at the bottom 24 and is then discharged by the float operated shutter 25 moving down, which movement occurs as the water level in the tank drops. In Figures 7 to 10, another embodiment of the device according to the invention is illustrated which differs from the previously described one in that the level adjusting means and the shutter element opening means are a single piece. With reference to Figures 7 and 8, an embodiment of the level ad3usting or.control device is shown therein the shutter element whereof is similar to the one previously described and, therefore, will not be further discussed, similar parts being designated with the same reference numerals. At the end of the rocker arm shutter which is externally to the chamber 3, there is provided a small block 40, whereto one clevis end of a lever 41 pivoted at a middle portion thereof in a supporting frame 42 is articulated. With its other end, the lever 41 is articulated through a clevis joint to the upper end of a vertical stem 50 arranged to slide vertically in said frame 42 and carrying a buoyant weight 51 having a lower specific gravity water while having an appreciable weight by itself. To allow the level to be adjusted, as will be explained hereinafter, the buoyant weight 51 is coupled to the vertical stem 50 by means of pins which are inserted through one of the holes 53 formed at spaced intervals along the vertical stem 50 and intended to permit the buoyant weight 51 to be secured at a predetermined position on the stem 50. This embodiment operates in principle similarly to the previous one, with the difference that as the water level raises in the tank 2, it is the buoyant weight 51 itself which, by moving upwardly on account of its specific gravity being lower than that of water, acts on the lever 41 which. displaces the rocker arm shutter such as to bring the shutter 5 to the closed or shut off position. It is noteworthy that also in this case the closing action occurs instantaneously, in that as the seal or gasket 10 approaches the water inlet port 11, a sucking action occurs as due to the reduced pressure at the port resulting from the waterflow velocity thus, the closure occurs in a practically instantaneous manner and is maintained by the pressure of the water supply itself. the the water provided in the reservoir or tank 2 is discharged, the buoyant weight 51 moves under its own weight downwards to rotate the lever 41 in the opposite direction, which lever, in turn, causes a rotation of the rocker arm shutter, owing to the linkage described hereinabove, such as to open the water inlet port 11. Figures 9 and 10 illustrate another embodiment which is also characterized in that it comprises one piece level control and opening means, with the difference, with respect to the device shown in Figures 7 and 8, that a linear motion shutter is provided instead of a.rocker asm type. More specifically, there is provided in the chamber 3 a linear motion shutter 60 which moves in a direction through the inlet port, back and forth.The linear motion shutter is connected to a small rod 61 which is arranged to slide in sealed relationship, by the interposition of an 0 ring 62, through a wall of the chamber 3 and has at its free end, externally located with respect to the chamber 3, a sleeve block 63 which engages with a middle portion of a small lever 64 having one of its ends articulated, in fixed point relationship, to the supporting frame 65 of the device and its other end articulated, through a clevis joint, to the upper or top end of a vertically slidable stem 70 which is supported in the supporting frame 65 arid carries a buoyant weight of a similar type to the buoyant weight 51 of the previous embodiment, designated accordingly with the same reference numeral. In this embodiment, when there is no water in the tank Figure 9 , the buoyant weight 51 moves linearly downwards to cause the lever 64 to rotate and move the rod 61, and accordingly the shutter 60, linearly downwards, thereby the shutter 60 uncovers the inlet port 10. Upon the water level inside the tank 2 reaching the buoyant weight 51, the latter, having a lower specific gravity than water, moves linearly upwards and rotates the lever 64 such as to move linearly upwards the rod 63, which brings the shutter 60 close to the inlet port 11 whereat, also in this case, it is practically sucked in and held in close contact by the water supply pressure to ensure a tight seal. YNhen the tank water is discharged, the buoyant weight 51 moves by gravity linearly dosmawards to re open the inlet port 11 and admit water to the tank inside, as already explained hereinabove. It will be appreciated from the foregoing descriptions of this device embodiments that they all eliminate the conventional design float, i.e.a float comprising a hollow body having a certain volume and as small a weight as possible, which results in the advantage that it is no longer necessary to provide the typical lever arm of conventional floats, the closure being no longer effected by the float action but rather by the delivery pressure of the water supply system which ensures automatically a perfect seal. In actual practice, the weight, which has a lower specific gravity than water, as utilized in the embodiments described hereinabove, merely has thelfunction of allowing the uncovering of the water inlet port moreover, the buoyant weight also serves the function of an actuator which provides the consent to the movement of the shutter 5 to the closed position. Furthermore, an added substantial difference from level control devices of known design is that the weight constitutes in this case the element which provides for the opening of the water inlet port, whereas in conventional devices it was the water pressure itself which effected the opening or uncovering, it no longer meeting the opposition force of the conventional float buoyancy. Thus, it may be seen that the device according to this invention achieves substantial practical advantages, and it is noteworthy that the buoyant weight 51 or weight 30, which in the embodiments discussed are formed from rigid foam material weighted with a lead insert may, if required, be formed from a homogeneous substance having a lower specific gravity than water, while having an adequate weight to ensure the device operation. The invention as described is susceptible to many modifications and variations within the purview of the instant inventive concept. moreover all of the details may be replaced by other technically equivalent elements. In practicing the invention, the materials employed, as well as the dimensions and contingent shapes, may be any ones to suit individual application requirements.
