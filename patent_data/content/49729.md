# Process and apparatus for cooling a cold rolled steel strip.

## Abstract
A cold rolled steel strip 52 having an elevated tempera ture is continuously cooled to a desired temperature at a desired cooling rate by a process comprising moving the cold rolled steel strip 52 along at least one vertical cooling path, and bringing a plurality of streams each consisting of a mixture of a cooling gas 54 and a cooling liquid 55 into contact with each surface of the steel strip 52 , each mixture stream being prepared by jetting the cooling gas 54 and liquid 55 independently from others in directions intersect ing each other before the vertical path of the steel strip 52 .
