# Rotary fluid energy translating device.

## Abstract
A rotary fluid energy translating device which comprises a casing and a torque ring rotatably supported in the casing. Static fluid pressure is applied to the torque ring at circumfer entially spaced points and from both the outer and the inner side of the ring so that a couple of forces is produced in the torque ring at each of the circumferentially spaced points thereby to rotate the torque ring, which can be connected to a mechanical element outside the casing. By positively rotating the torque ring by means of an external drive, it is possible to operate the device as a fluid pump.
