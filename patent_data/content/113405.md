# Method for making semiconductor resistors.

## Abstract
A high sheet resistance, doped semiconductor resistor is made by a process which produces a resistor diffusion or ion implantation mask having a narrow dimension determined by a sidewall technique. The sidewall technique defines the narrow dimension by the thickness of a doped or undoped layer 6 deposited on a different underlying layer having horizontal and vertical surfaces 5 . The horizontal portion of the deposited layer is removed by anistropic etching to leave only the vertical portion 6 . The vertical portion, if undoped, is removed to define a diffused or ion implanted resistor. The vertical portion, if doped, may either be removed after heating to form a diffused resistor, or may be left in place to form a resistor in shunt with the diffused resistor.
