# Electronic circuit for Geiger Müller gamma ray detectors.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus are described for reducing the dead time of a Geiger Müller tube to about 5 or 6 microseconds in which the initial fall in anode voltage of the tube caused by a gamma ray photon penetrating its wall and ionising the gas in the tube is amplified and the amplified signal used to switch the anode voltage to a lower value, thereby inhibiting further ionisation of the gas in the Geiger Müller tube. After a short period of time in the range 3 to 10 microseconds, preferably 5 to 6 microseconds, the anode voltage is switched back to the original relatively higher voltage.
