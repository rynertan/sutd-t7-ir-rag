# LOCK UP TYPE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION

## Abstract
A lock up control system for a lock up type automatic transmission. A load detector means 220 generates a reference ac celeration signal α that indicates a reference acceleration, generates an actual acceleration signal α that indicates an actual acceleration of the automotive vehicle, and compares the actual acceleration signal with the reference acceleration signal for generating a first command signal a L level signal from the comparator 224 when the actual acceleration signal is greater than the reference acceleration signal and generates a second command signal a H level signal from the compara tor 224 when the actual acceleration signal is smaller than the reference acceleration signal. The first command signal is fed to a first vehicle speed comparator means 225 to render same operative. The second command signal is fed to a se cond vehicle comparator means 226 to render same operati ve. Each of the first and second comparator means compares the vehicle speed signal V with a set of reference vehicle speeds V
