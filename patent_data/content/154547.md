# A dynamic read write random access memory.

## Abstract
A dynamic read write random access memory is de scribed having memory cells 211 214 each including switching means Tt and a capacitor C connected between one side of the switching means and a voltage supply line. A bit line B, B is connected to the other side of each switch means Tt , and a word line W₁ W₄ is connected to a control terminal of each switching means Tt . When a first voltage level is applied to one of the word lines one memory cell is selected and when a second voltage level is applied that memory cell is not selected. A voltage supply circuit 241 applies to the bit line B,
