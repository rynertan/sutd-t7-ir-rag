# Retaining ring tool.

## Abstract
A universal retaining ring tool that is shiftable between internal and external modes of operation. The tool includes a pair of pivotally connected handles 10, 12 , a pair of jaw members 16, 18 selectively coupled to the handles by a latching arrangement 24 including two transversely slid able latch members 30, 31 . In one position of the latch members one handle member is coupled to one jaw member and the other handle is coupled to the other jaw member. When the latch members are switched, the one handle is coupled to the other jaw member and the other handle is coupled to the one jaw member. Removable tips 19 are secured to each jaw member by an associated clamping plate 20 that includes a corner that diverges from the overall plane of the clamping plate towards the associated jaw member. The fastener for securing the clamping plate is critically located so that a positive clamping force is exerted on the tip in a region where it enters the jaw.
