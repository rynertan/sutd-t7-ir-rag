# Multiplex subsampling transmission system for a high definition color television picture signal.

## Abstract
A high definition color television picture signal is unified by the time axis compressed integration TCI means 1 and the bandwidth thereof is extremely narrowed by the dot interlace subsampling means 2 . As a result, a narrow band transmission picture signal accompanied with a control signal means 4, 11 adapted to the restoration of the received original picture signal, which is suitable for the satellite broadcast, can be obtained through a comparatively simple arrangement. The received narrow band transmis sion picture signal can be restored by the interpolation adapted respectively to the stationary picture and the motional picture under the control of the control signal or the picture motional information detected from the received picture signal with the reinforcement of the control signal, so that the original high definition can be sufficiently main tained through a comparatively simple receiving equipment.
