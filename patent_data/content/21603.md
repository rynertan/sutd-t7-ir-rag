# Tube end forming apparatus.

## Abstract
A tube or rod end forming apparatus comprising a rotary head 12 provided with a series of angularly spaced dies for cooperation with a tube or rod held by a clamping device 10 which locates the tube or rod in alignment with the lowermost die. The head 12 is angularly indexable by means of an arm which is pivotal about the rotary axis of the head 12 and is provided with a piston and cylinder operated plunger for cooperation with sockets in the head 12 . The arm is pivoted by a piston and cylinder to effect indexing of the head 12 . This arrangement allows accurate indexing of the head 12 while positively holding it captive against rotation while the head 12 executes a forming operation. The clamping device 10 is so constructed that its jaws can be readily replaced or re orientated for use with different tube diameters without the need for any bolting or like fastening devices. The apparatus can be automatically controlled to execute a series of working strokes whose lengths vary according to the die size, the head 12 being returned to a predetermined datum position on completion of the working cycle.
