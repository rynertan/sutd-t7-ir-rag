# ELECTRICAL STIMULATION OF MUSCLE

## Abstract
A method and apparatus are disclosed for the electrot rophic stimulation of muscle, that is, stimulation using pulses trains onto which information which will cause long term functional and or structural changes in the muscle tissue. This information is coded onto the interval between successive pulses of the series. Also disclosed is a method and apparatus for acquiring trophic data from motor unit action potential series.
