# Process for preparing an iron oxide.

## Abstract
A process is disclosed for the prodution of micaceous iron oxide using metallic iron, for example scrap iron, as a feed stock for the preparation of an iron chloride and the resulting iron chloride is oxidised at an elevated temperature in the presence of a salt of an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal, preferably sodium chloride. A reaction may be effected in a packed tower reactor comprising a refractory tube 7 contain ing an inert packing material e.g. aluminosilicate ceramic balls. The reaction charge including packing material, metallic iron and the salt is introduced via hopper 13. A tube 7 is externally heated by electrical resistance elements 10 and chlorine and an oxidising gas are introduced at inlet 8 and the off gas removed at outlet 9. The micaceous iron reaction pro duct is obtained as a coating of the inert packing material. Micaceous iron oxide is used as a pigment for the formulation of metal protective paints.
