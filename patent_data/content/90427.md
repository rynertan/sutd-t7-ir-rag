## Description
COMPOSITIONS OF HYDROCARBON SUBSTITUTED DIPHENYL AMINES AND HIGH MOLECULAR WEIGHT POLYETHYLENE GLYCOLS AND THE USE THEREOF AS WATER TREE RETARDANTS FOR POLYMERS This invention relates to water tree retardants comprising hyime carbon substituted diphanyl amines and high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the use thereof as additives to polymeric omesitions, as for example, compositions based on ethylene polymers. The resultant compositians are useful as extrudates about electrical conductors providing insulation thereen which is resistant to water treeing.The serviece life of insulated power cables is known to be shortened by a prebreakdown phenomenon termed water treeing. Consequently, insulation based on polymeric compositions, as for example, compositions of ethylene polymers, has been modified by the addition thereto of various additives for the purpose of providing insulation characterized by resistance to water treeing. Water trees occur when insulation is subjected to an electrical field, over a prolonged period of of time, while in an environment in which water is present. Water trees are so named because of a resemblance to branched trees. In actuality, water trees are fine passages or voids which are visibly white when filled with water but became invisible when dry.For purposes of observation, specimens with water trees must be boiled in water or dyed. Water trees start to grow at points of voltage stress in the insulation. Points of stress might be at sites in the insulation at which there are voids, contamination, or irregularities, far instance at the interface between the insulation and a semi conductive layer. In the case of voids or contamination, trees tend to form at apposite sides of the point of stress the nucleus and, in tine, grow to resesble a bow tie. Trees initiated at an interface grow in one direction in the form of a bush and are referred to as vented trees. The two types of water trees, bow tie and vented, appear to start and to grow by different mechanisms, as indicated by their differing response to many of the water tree retardants that have been examined. Up until the present time, no single water tree retardant system has been developed which, when added to a polymeric composition, results in a composition which has a commercially acceptable balance of properties including resistance, over prolonged periods of tine, to the formation of bottie trees and vented water trees. The accompanying drawing is a schematic sectional view showing the apparatus used to cause water trees of the bow tie type to grow in a test specimen. The present invention provides a water tree retardant composition comprising a hydrocarbon substituted diphenyl amine and a high molecular weight polyethylene glycol which, when added tD polymeric materials such as an ethylene polymer, provides compositions which have a commericially acoept able balance of properties including resistance to the formation of bow tie water trees and vented water trees.The compositions of this invention retain resistance to water trees over prolonged periods of time, at normal qp erating or service temperatures of the insulated electrical conductors, about which they are extruded, without undergoing an undesirable degradation of physical or electrical properties. Th addition the compositions of this invention can be cured to water tree resistant, crosslinked products, without a signficant increase in the normal concentrations of the crosslinking agent, the the organic peroxide,by the addition of an appropriate crosslinking booster. As stated, the water tree retardants of this invention comprise a composition of a hydrocarbon sdbstituted diphenyl amine and a high molecular weight polyethylene glycol. Afirag diphenyl amines, substituted by one or more hydrocarbon radicals on the aranatic rings, which are suitable for purposes of this invention are those having the formula FORMULA IEMI3.1 wherein each R, which can be the same or different, is hydrogen or a hydro carbon radical such as alkyl or aralkyl radicals substituted in the para and or ortho positions relative to the amino group, provided that at least one R is a hydrocarbon radical. As a rule, each R has 5 to 18 carbon atoms, preferably 8 to 9 carbon atoms. Illustrative of such radicals are those derived fran OC olefIn such as n hexene, nrheptene, n octene, n nonene and the like as well as rad icals derived from styrene, alpha methyl styrene and the like. Particularly desirable for purposes of this invention are liquid diphenyl amines, as described, such as a diphenyl amine alkylated with styrene or octylene. A liquid diphenyl amine alkylated with styrene and sold by Goodyear Tire and Rdbber Company under the tradenme of Wingstay 29 is an example of such a compound. This compound is obtained by reacting diphenyl amine with styrene under alkylation conditions using a Friedel Crafts catalyst, according to the follcwing idealized equation EMI4.1 It actuality, it is believed that this compound is a mixture of mono and disstituted species. Compositions containing a liquid, hydrocarbon substituted diphenyl amine, in conjunction with a high molecular weight polyethylene glycol, in addition to being characterized by the properties previously described, are relatively free of blooming , a term used to describe surface exudation. Other suitable diphenyl amines are described subsequently herein. Polyethylene glycols, suitable for purposes of this invention are those having a molecular weight of about 1,000 to about 20,000. Particularly desirable polyethylene glycols have a carbon number, that is, number of carbon atoms of at least 30, preferably at least 80. Cbmmercially available polyethylene glycols, suitable for purposes of this invention, are marketed by Union Carbide Corporation under the tradeeark Carbowax and under the designation 20M. These materials are described in Union Carbide Corporation Brochure No. F 4772 I, 1 78 entitled, Carbowax, Polyethylene Glycol . Amount of polyethylene glycol, relative to the diphenyl amine is suf ficient to provide a composition which, when added to a polymeric material, result in a polymeric pcsition which has improved resistance to water treeing. Preferably the amount of polyethylene glycol, relative to the bon substituted diphenyl amine is about 0.2 to about 1 part by weight per 1 part by weight of the diphenyl amine Among suitable polymeric material to which the aforenoted tree retardant compostion can be added in order to provide water tree resistant sitijns are ethylene polymers such as normally solid homopolymers of ethylene, copolymers of ethylene and X olefins and copolymers of ethylene alpha olefins and diene monomers.Exemplary of suitable copolymerizable monomers are alpha olefins such as propylene, butene l, hexene l, and the like diene monomers such as butadiene, isoprene and the like wherein the polymers contain at least about 70 percent by weight ethylene. Preferred copolymers are ethylene prozylene copolymers, ethylenebutene copolymers and the like. These copolymers can be produced under low pressure of about 150 to about 300 psi, using a chraniun oxide catalyst modified with titanium as disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,011,382 granted March 8, 1977. If desired, other polymers such as polyprcFylene, ethylene propylene rubber, ethylene propylene diene rubber and the like can be added to the ethylene polymer oompositions of this invention. The e compositions of this invention can contain antioxidants such as sterically hindered phenols and amines, polymerized 2,2,4 tetramethyl hydroquinoline, 4,4 thio bis 6 t butyl 3 methylphenol , thiodietylenebis 3,5 ditert butyl 4 hydroxy hydrocinnamate, distearyltiodipropionate and the like. Also, the catpositicns of the present invention can contain crosslinking agents when the compositions are to be used as vulcanized or crosslinked products rather than as thermoplastic compositions. Vulcanizing or crosslinking agents are well known in the art and include organic peroxides as described in U.S. Patent 3,296,189, granted January 3, 1967. These compounds can be used singly, or in combination with one another, or in wrbination with a crouslinking booster. Particularly desirable curable ccmpusitions for purposes of this invention comprise an ethylene polymer, a liquid hydrocarbon substituted diFhenyl amine, a high molecular weight polyethylene glycol, an organic peroxide and a silane crosslinking booster having the average formula FORMULA IIEMI6.1 wherein R1 and R2, which can be the same or different, are hydrocarbon radical generally having 6 to 18 carbon atoms, prefe ably 12 to 14 carbon atoms, and n is an integer having a value of 4 to 20, preferably 4 to 16 or a silane cross linking booster having the average formula FORMULA IIIEMI6.2 wherein R1 and R2 are as previously defined and x and y, which can be the same or different, are integers having a value of 4 to 8.
