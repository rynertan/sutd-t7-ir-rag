# Approach to hover control system for helicopters.

## Abstract
An approach to hover control system for a helicopter in which a constant deceleration is commanded 30 at an initial approach speed and then the actual deceleration as a time function T₁ of the airspeed from the initial airspeed to a second airspeed is measured. Based on these measures. the total deceleration time T₁2 to approach to a hover condition can be predicted accurately after which the commanded deceleration is removed.
