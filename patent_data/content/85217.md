# Prevention of deleterious deposits in a coal liquefaction system.

## Abstract
A process for preventing the formation of deleterious coke deposits on the walls of coal liquefaction reactor vessels involves passing hydrogen and a feed slurry 24 comprising feed coal 10 and recycle liquid solvent 14 to a coal liquefication reaction zone 26 while imparting a critical mixing energy of at least 3500 ergs per cubic centimeter of reaction zone volume per second to the reacting slurry.
