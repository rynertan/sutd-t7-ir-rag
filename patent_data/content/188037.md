# Bidentate chelating monomers and polymers.

## Abstract
A composite structure and method therefor comprises a metal surface which is coated with a polymer incorporating a bidentate chelating functionality. The polymer provides significant and varied chemical modification to the metal surface and is useful, for example, as a protective coating or a priming layer. Bidentate chelating monomers useful in preparing homopolymers and copolymers with ethylenical ly unsaturated non chelating monomers have structures described by the formula
