## Description
TIE APPARATUS The present invention is directed generally to tie apparatus and more particularly to tie apparatus whose component parts are integrally formed with one another. While the present invention may find utility in a variety of applications, the disclosure will be facilitated by addressing specifically the problem of suspending grape vines from support wires. Historically, strips of fabric, string or the like have been utilized to attach or suspend grape vines from overhead lines or support wires. It will be appreciated, however, that this process is time consuming and relatively labour intensive. Moreover, care must be taken to ensure that the string or fabric strips are not tied too tightly, to allow the vines sufficient room to grow within the tie.To release the grape vines at the end of the season, when they are typically cut back, the fabric or string is cut and discarded, thus requiring new ties to be provided and installed for the following growing season. General objects of the present invention are to provide tie apparatus which is re usable and is adapted to be left installed on an overhead line or support wire is adapted to be attached to the support wire by a simple manipulation and is further adapted loosely to surround one or more vines in response to a second relatively simple manipulation and is relatively simple and inexpensive to construct as a one piece integrally formed member, such as by an inexpensive plastics moulding process or the like. A more specific object of the present invention is.. o provide tie apparatus which is adapted to release the one or more suspended vines in response to a predetermined amount of force applied thereto in substantially one direction selected from one or more suitable directions. Tie apparatus in accordance with the present invention, for suspending one or more vines or the like from a line or the like, comprises releasable line engaging means which is integrally formed with releasable vine holding means said vine holding means including elongate flexible arm means extending from said line engaging means and elastically deformable to define a loop locking means formed at a remote end of said flexible arm means complementary locking means for engaging said locking means to close said loop and permit suspension of said one or more vines or the like from said line or the like said complementary locking means being responsive to application of a predetermined amount of force to said flexible arm means substantially in at least one direction to release said locking means and thereby open said closed loop. In a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, said locking means is substantially spherical in configuration and defines a diameter of predetermined dimension said complementary locking means is a generally U shaped channel having sidewall portions and defining a cross sectional dimension less than said predetermined dimension said sidewall portions have sidewall extensions and locking recess means and cam lead in surface means are located on said sidewall extensions said U shaped channel and said sidewall extensions thereof being elastically deformable for permitting slidable movement of said locking means therethrough in response to a predetermined amount of force applied to said locking means as a result of said predetermined force applied to said flexible arm means in said at least one direction. Said particularly preferred tie apparatus, in accordance with the present invention, will now be described, by way of example only, with reference tp the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a front elevation of tie apparatus in accordance with the present invention, illustrating engagement thereof with an overhead line or support wire Figure 2 is a perspective view of the tie apparatus shown suspending several vines from the overhead line Figure 3 is a side elevation of the tie apparatus illustsrating elastically deformable movement thereof for completely surrounding the vines Figure 4 is a front elevation similar to Figure 1 illustrating the tie apparatus in a closed or locked configuration for normally surrounding and suspending the vines from the overhead wire and further illustrating one method of releasing the vines Figure 5 is an enlarged view of a portion of Figure 4 illustrating elastic deformation of portions of the tie apparatus for releasing the vines therefrom Figure 6 is a side elevation taken generally in the plane of the line 6 6 of Figure 1 Figure 7 is a top plan view taken generally in the plane of the line 7 7 in Figure 1 and Figure 8 is an enlarged partial sectional view taken generally along the line 8 8 of Figure 4. The attention of the reader is directed to Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings, wherein tie apparatus in accordance with the present invention is designated generally by the reference numeral 10. This tie or clip 10 includes a line engaging portion designated generally by the reference numeral 12 for surroundingly engaging an overhead support wire ore line 14 and an integrally formed vine holding portion designated generally by the reference numeral 16 for surroundingly engaging one or more vines to be suspended from the overhead support wire or line 14.Referring initially to the vine supporting or holding portion 16, it will be seen that it includes an elongate flexible arm member or portion 18 which depends integrally from a side or peripheral wall portion 20 of the wire engaging portion 12.Preferably, this elongate flexible arm 18 is generally fishhook shaped and curves outwardly somewhat as indicated at reference numeral 22 adjacent its junction with the peripheral or side wall 20. Additionally, an opposite free end or terminal end 24 of the arm 18 is provided with an integrally formed enlarged head portion 26 which in the illustrated embodiment is generally spherical in form. As will be seen presently, the spherical surface of the head 26 comprises a cam surface for locking engagement with locking structure also formed integrally with the wire or line engaging structure 12. Preferably, the extent of the arm l8 is such as to normally locate the head 26 somewhat vertically below and laterally spaced apart from the wire engaging structure 12 as best viewed in Fig. 1.Referring next to the wire engaging structure 1E, it will be seen to include the outer or peripheral wall portion 20 which defines a generally U shaped passage 28 having an entrance 29 for receiving the wire 14.The entrance 29 may be provided with a flared out lead in surface 30 to facilitate placement and guidance of the wire 14 with respect to the passage 28. An additional flexible closure member 32 is provided for normally closing off a major fractional part of the entrance 29. As best viewed in Fig. 4, this flexible closure member 32 is angled inwardly of the passage and leaves a small gap or opening 34 in the otherwise closed entrance 29.Preferably, flexible closure 32 is elastically movable inwardly of passage 28 for permitting ingress or entry of the wire 14 into the passage 28 as illustrated generally in Fig. 1. In this regard, the clip or tie may be manually gripped as generally illustrated in phantom line in Fig. 1 and moved with a relatively simple motion to achieve the motion relative to wire 14 generally indicated by the arrows associated with the wire 14 in Fig. 1. Preferably, however, the clip 10 is moved with the wire 14 remaining stationary. It will be recognized from the foregoing that the elastically deformable closure member 32 normally opposes removal of the wire or line 14 once positioned in the passage 28 as just described. In this regard, preferably the dimension across the gap 34 is somewhat smaller than the diameter of the wire 14. However, the passage 28 is preferably considerably larger than the cross sectional dimension of the wire 14. Thus, the tie or clip 10 is held rotatably suspended from the wire 14. i Referring now to Fig. 2, it will be seen that one or more vines 19 or similar objects may be readily inserted into a partial loop defined by the generally fishhook shaped flexible arm 18 between the head 26 thereof and a locking portion designated generally by the reference numeral 40 to be presently described.Reference is next invited to Fig. 3, which illustrates the interfitting and releasable locking of the arm 18 and in particular the head portion 26 with respect to the locking portion 40. In this regard, it will be appreciated that the flexible arm 18 is elastically deformable to accomplish the movementEMI6.1 EMI6.2 into a locked or 1closed loop position illustrated in Fig. 4. In this regard, the locking portion 40 is integrally formed adjacent to a side portion of the peripheral wall 20 and is generally co extensive in height therewith. This locking portion 40 includes a channel portion 42 which comprises a generally U shaped channel defining a cross sectional dimension 44 see Fig. 7 .Generally co extensive, parallel and spaced apart side walls 46 and 48 of the channel 42 define this dimension 44 which isEMI6.3 somewhat less than the diameter of the spherical head 26.Extensions 50 and 52 of the side walls 46 and 48 define generally U shaped locking recesses 54 and 56 which are dimensioned for receiving opposite outer edge portions of the spherical head member or portion 26. Preferably, interior surfaces of the recesses 54, 56 are semicircular and define diameters somewhat smaller than the diameter of spherical head 26.Accordingly, the locking recesses 54 and 56 are generally congruent and coaxially located with each other on the spaced apart extensions 50 and 52. Cobperatively, a pair of cam lead in surfaces 58, 60 are formed on upper edges of the extensions 50, 52 for slideably guiding the spherical head member or portion 26 around the extensions and into engagement with the locking recesses 54, 56 as illustrated generally in Figs. 3 and 4. In this regard, the flexible arm 18 is preferably sufficiently elastically deformable to permit this motion.However, this elastically deformable arm preferably resiliently tends to return toward its undeformed position illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2, whereby the head portion 26 is urged generally in a direction so as to encourage or facilitate locking engagement with the respective locking recesses 54, 56.Advantageously, the elongate arm 18 thereby defines a sufficiently large enclosed loop, as illustrated inFig. 4, to permit substantial growth of the vines 19 once loosely surrounded thereby and suspended from the overhead support wire or line 14. At the end of a growing season, the vines may readily be removed from the clip or tie apparatus 10 of the invention by the simple expedient of grasping the vines 19 and pulling sharply generally in a downward direction as indicated by arrows 70 see Fig. 4 .. However, referring briefly to Fig. 8, this releasing force may be applied, relative to the head 26, generally in any of a plurality of directions between arrows 71 somewhat below the horizontal and 73 vertically down as indicated by arrows 75.As best viewed in Fig. 5, thos force or motion will cause the cam surface defined generally by spherical head 26 to engage or cam against additional cam surfaces generally defined by side wall extensions 50 and 52 about the recesses 54 and 56. When sufficient force is imparted to the head 26 by way of the arm or loop 18 and vines 19 as described, the side walls 46 and 48 and their extensions 50 and 52 will elastically deform as indicated generally by arrows 72. This permits slideable withdrawal of the head 26 from the locking recesses 54 and 56, generally through the expanded or deformed channel 42 and or extensions 50, 52, for example, as indicated generally by the arrow 74.Hence, the clip or tie apparatus 10 may advantageously be left suspended or hanging from the overhead or line or support wire 14 for later use as desired.Advantageously, in this regard, and as best illustrated in Fig. 5, the structure of the invention prevents disengagement of the wire or line engaging portion 12 during the foregoing removal operation.In this regard, it will be seen that the motion or force indicated by line 70 Fig. 4 or 71, 73 Fig. 8 will also cause a hinge like deformation of a central or apical and preferably relatively thinner portion 76 of the peripheral wall 20. This in turn causes fulcruming of respective sides thereof as indicated generally at arrows 78. This motion in turn causes relative inward collapse or movement of the facing inner side wall surfaces of the passage 28 as indicated generally at arrows 80. It will be recognized that this inward collapse or motion urges the otherwise free end of the flexible closure member 32 into relatively firm engagement with the facing interior surface of the passage 28 to substantially prevent disengagement of the clip or tie apparatus 10 during the vine removal procedure just described. It is believed in this regard that the elastic return of the peripheral wall portions 20 to the undeformed state illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2 is delayed sufficiently to prevent disengagement from the wire or. line 14 as it snaps back when the force indicated by arrow 70 is released.
