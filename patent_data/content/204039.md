## Description
BERATED, HYDROLYZED EPOXIES AND LUBRICANT COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THEM This invention relates to borated hydrolyzed hydrocarbyl epoxides and to lubricant compositions containing them as multifunctional additives. Lubricants are used to reduce the friction between moving surfaces. Additives are frequently added to lubricants in minor amounts, to enhance the friction reducing properties of those lubricants without modifying their other physical properties such as viscosity, density and pour point. Alcohols have long been known for their lubricity properties when formulated into lubricating oils and for their water scavenging characteristics when incorporated into fuel formulations.Hydrocarbon soluble epoxidized fatty acid esters prepared by the epoxidation of unsaturated carboxylic acid esters have been used as anti wear and anti friction additives in lubricants, as described inU.S. Patent 4,244,829. Borated hydrolysis products of 1 2 hydroxyalkyl 2 alkyl or alkenylimidazolines are known to be effective friction modifying additives from U.S. Patent 4,273,665.Further, vicinal hydroxyl containing alkyl carboxylates such as glycerol monooleate have also found widespread use as lubricity additives. U.S. Patent 4,410,438 describes borated epoxide additives and lubricants containing them. In the preparation of those additives, an epoxide is reacted whith boric acid, boron oxide or an alkyl borate in the absence of added water. The present invention is based on the observation that borated hydrolyzed hydrocar yl poxides re capable of significantly enhancing the friction reducing properties of lubricants and simultaneously provide anti oxidation and high temperature proper ties to lubricant compositions. The borated compounds also possess improved solubility characteristics over those of non borated derivatives, especially in synthetic oils. Additionally, these additives are non corrosive to copper and possess anti wear properties and the ability to provide anti fatigue characteristics to oils and greases containing them. According to the invention, there is provided a borated, hydrolyzed, hydrocarbyl epoxide obtained by hydrolyzing a hydrocarbyl epoxide having from 14 to 36 carbon atoms with a substantially stoichiometric amount of water in the presence of a boric acid catalyst at a temperature of 150 to 2500C and borating the resulting diol and or oligomer formed during hydrolysis. The invention also provides lubricant compositions comprising a lubricant and from 0.1 to 10 by weight of such a borated compound, and a method for reducing the fuel consumption of internal combustion engines by treating their moving surfaces with such lubricant compositions. The additives of the invention are long chain hydrocarbyl epoxides which have been hydrolyzed with boric acid catalyst and borated to form a mixture of borate esters of the corresponding diols and borate esters of oligomers of the epoxides which polymerize during hydrolysis. The additive compounds formed in this way are very different from, and often superior to, borate esters formed by boration of the corresponding preformed diols made by traditional hydrolysis of the long chain epoxides. The hydrocarbyl groups contain at least 14 carbon atoms and up to 36 carbon atoms.The epoxide group can be anywhere along the chain, but is preferably in the 1,2 oX terminal position. The hydrocarbyl group can be straight chain, or branched chain, or contain cyclic groups or unsaturated groups, but is preferably an alkyl group. Preferred epoxides include 1, 2 epoxynonadecane, 1,2 epoxyheptadecane, 1, 2 epoxytetradecane, 1,3 epoxyhexadecane, 1,2 epoxypentadecane, 1,2 epoxyoctadecane and mixtures of similar epoxides. Lubricant compositions comprising oils of lubricating viscosity and greases prepared therefrom containing these additives possess multi functional characteristics. Further, when moving surfaces of, for example, internal combustion engines, are treated with lubricant compositions containing these additives, a means of obtaining improved fuel economy for such engines is provided. The amount of additive in the lubricant compositions may range from 0.1 to 10 by weight of the total lubricant composition, preferably from 0.5 to about 5 by weight, for example from 0.25 to 4 by weight. The lubricant compositions preferably include other materials such as corrosion inhibitors, viscosity index improvers, extreme pressure agents, detergents, dispersants and antiwear additives, all of which impart their customary properties to the particular compositions and do not detract from the value of the compositions into which they are incorporated. Such additives often include succinimides, sulfonates, phenates, olefin copolymers, methacrylates, zinc dithiophosphates and overbased calcium and magnesium salts. Preferably, however, the friction reducing additives of the invention are used with zinc dithiophosphates and in such formulations exhibit significant activity. Generally, the total amount of all such additive materials will not exceed about 10 to 20 by weight. The additives of the invention should contain at least 0.1 of boron and may contain 10 or more of boron. At least 5 to 10 of the available epoxide groups should be borated, although a stoichiometric excess of borating agent can effectively be used. The lubricants into which the additives can be incorporated include both mineral and synthetic hydrocarbon oils of lubricating viscosity, mixtures of mineral and synthetic oils, and greases prepared therefrom, and other solid lubricants. The synthetic oils may include polyisobutylenes, hydrogenated olefins, polypropylene glycol, di 2 ethylhexyl sebacate, dibutyl phthalate, neopentyl esters, pentaerythritol esters, trimethylol propane esters, fluorocarbons, silicate esters, silanes, hydrogenated mineral oils, chain type polyphenyl, siloxanes and silicones, and phenoxy phenylethers. Preferred are synthetic formulations.Where the lubricant is to be employed in the form of a grease, the lubricating oil is generally employed in an amount sufficient to balance the total grease composition, after accounting for the desired quantity of the thickening agent and other additive components to be included in the grease formulation. A wide variety of materials may be employed as thickening or gelling agents. These may include any of the conventional metal salts or soaps, such as lithium and calcium which are dispersed in the lubricating vehicle in grease forming quantities to impart to the resulting grease composition the desired consistency. Included are lithium and calcium 12 hydroxy stearates or stearate soaps or similar metal soaps or non soap thickeners, such as surface modified clays and silicas, aryl ureas, calcium complexes and similar materials.In general, grease thickeners may be employed which do not melt and dissolve when used at the required temperature within a particular environment however, in all other respects, any materials which are normally employed for thickening or gelling hydrocarbon fluids for forming grease can be used in preparing greases in accordance with the invention. The additive compounds of the invention are prepared by the reaction of the hydrocarbyl epoxides with water in the presence of a suitable catalyst, and then borated. The use of traditional cata lysts such as sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid and p toluene sulfonic acid during this reaction step does not form the same product as that formed by the reaction of epoxide, water and borating agent. The additive compounds of the invention are uniquely formed in a one pot, one step combined boration hydrolysis polymerization involving the hydrocarbyl epoxide starting materials. The preferred borating agent is boric acid but other borating agents such as low molecular weight trialkyl borates which form boric acid in the presence of water, can also be used. For convenience, however, the boration and hydrolysis may be carried out in a single pot using substantially stoichiometric amounts of water. The reaction can also be carried out in the presence of an organic solvent having a low boiling temperature such as ethanol or butanol, or another solvent such as toluene or xylene. The reaction time can vary from 2 to about 14 hours. The preferred reaction time is from 4 to about 12 hours.The reaction temperature can vary from about 1500C to 25O0C. The following Examples illustrate the invention. EXAMPLE 1 Borated, Hydrolyzed, 1,2 Epoxy Mixed C15 c 18 Alkanes 245g of 1,2 epoxy mixed C15 C18 alkanes obtained commercially and containing the following 1,2 epoxyalkanes C15H30O, 28 C16H32O, 28 C17H34O, 28 C18H36H, 16 and having an approximate molecular weight of 244 , 70g toluene as solvent, 36g water and 419 boric acid were charged to a 2 liter stirred reactor equipped with a Dean Stark condensing trap.Nitrogen was used to blanket the reaction mixture. The reactants were heated to 1000C and held for 1.5 hours and then heated to 1600C over a period of 4 hours and held at 1600C for 2 additional hours until evolution of water, measured as azeotropic distillate, ceased. The solvent was then removed by vacuum distillation and the product was filtered through diatomaceous earth at approximately 1000C. The product formed an off white waxy solid upon cooling. EXAMPLE 2 Borated, Hydrolyzed I ,2 Epoxyhexadecane Approximately 1,0009 of 1 ,2 epoxyhexadecane, 1189 water, 193g boric acid and 1259 xylene as solvent were charged to a reactor equipped as described in Example 1. The reaction mixture was heated to 105 C and held for 12 hours and then the temperature was increased to 2250C until evolution of water, measured as azeotropic distillate, ceased. The solvent was then removed by vacuum distillation and the product was filtered. The product formed an off white waxy solid upon cooling. EXAMPLE 3 Borated, Hydrolyzed, 1,2 Epoxyhexadecane Approximately 1,0009 of 1,2 epoxyhexadecane, 118g water, 258.59 boric acid and 1259 xylene were charged to a reactor equipped as described in Example 1. The reaction mixture was heated to 1050C and held for 12 hours and then the temperature was increased to 2250C until water evolution ceased. The solvent was removed by vacuum distillation and the product was filtered to form a clear amber fluid which became an off white waxy solid upon cooling to room temperature. The products of the above Examples were blended into a fully formulated synthetic automotive engine oil and evaluated using the Low Velocity Friction Apparatus.Low Velocity Friction Apparatus LVFA The Low Velocity Friction Apparatus LVFA is used to measure the friction of test lubricants under various loads, temperatures, and sliding speeds. The LVFA consists of a flat SAE 1020 steel surface diam. 38.1 mm which is attached to a drive shaft and rotated over a stationary, raised narrow ringed SAE 1020 steel surface area 52mm2 . Both surfaces are submerged in the test lubricant. Friction between the steel surfaces is measured as a function of the sliding speed at a lubricant temperature of 1200C. The friction between the rubbing surfaces is measured using a torque arm strain guage system. The strain guage output, which is calibrated to be equal to the coefficint of friction, is fed to theY axis of an X Y plotter. The speed signal from the tachometer generator is fed to the X axis.To minimize external friction, the piston is supported by an air bearing. The normal force loading the rubbing surfaces is regulated by air pressure of the bottom of the piston. The drive system consists of an infinitely variable speed hydraulic transmission driven by a 370 w electric motor. To vary the sliding speed, the output speed of the transmission is regulated by a lever cam motor arrangement.Procedure The rubbing surfaces and 12 13 ml of test lubricant are placed on the LVFA. A 3450 kPa load is applied, and the sliding speed is maintained at 9.15 m minute at ambient temperature for a few minutes. A plot of coefficients of friction over a range of sliding speeds, 1.5 to 12.2 m minute 25 195 rpm , is obtained.A minimum of three measurements is obtained for each test lubricant. Then, the test lubricant and specimens are heated to 1200C, another set of measurements is obtained, and the system is run for 50 minutes at 1MOC, 3450 kPa, and 12.2 m minute sliding speed. Freshly polished steel specimens are used for each run. The surface of the steel is parallel ground to 0.1 to 0.2 pm. The percentages by weight are percentages by weight of the total lubricating oil composition, including the usual additive package.The data are percent decrease in friction according to EMI8.1 The value for the oil alone would be zero as shown in theTable below.

For example, an almost 40 reduction in friction was achieved with the use of only 0.5 of the product of Example 2. The oxidation stability of the additives was also measured by evaluating the additive blends in 200 second solvent paraffinic neutral lubricating oil using the Catalytic Oxidation Test at 163cm for 40 hours. The test lubricant composition is subjected to a stream of air which is bubbled through the composition at a rate of 5 liters per hour at 1630C for 40 hours. Present in the composition are metals commonly used as materials of engine construction namely 2 a 100 cm of sand blasted iron wire b 5 cm2 of polished copper wire c 5.6 cm2 of polished aluminum wire and d 1.08 cm2 of polished lead surface. Inhibitors for oxidation of for the oil are rated on the basis of prevention of oil deterioration as measured by the increase in acid formation or neutralization number NN and kinematic viscosity KV . The results of the test are set out in Table 2. TABLE 2 Oxidation Characteristics Catalytic Oxidation Test, 40 Hours at 1630C Increase in Additive Viscosity of Neutra Lead Conc.

The product of Example 1 was further subjected to theCopper Strip Corrosivity Test. The test was run in 200 second, solvent paraffinic neutral lubricating oil in accordance with ASTM Do130 80. The results set out in Table 3 clearly show the borate esters to be non corrosive to copper. TABLE 3 Copper Strip Corrosivity Characteristics Additive Test Rating Conc.

Furthermore, these additives have multi functional characteristics. In addition to friction reducing properties, they also provide anti corrosion, anti oxidation, anti wear and high temperature properties not generally available in a single lubricant additive.
