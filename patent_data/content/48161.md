## Description
PHONOGRAPH This invention relates to a phonograph of a type comprising a record having a plurality of recorded grooves, a respective lead in groove for each recorded groove and at least one run out groove provided thereon, a tone arm rotatably mounted adjacent the record and a stylus depending from the free end of the tone arm for tracking the grooves.Such phonographs provide a plurality of alternative recordings on the same side of a record, so that the said side of the record can be played more than once and produce a different output each time, depending on the actual number of recorded grooves.Prior art publications include United States Patent Specification USPS No. 3 740 055 and USPS No. 4 135 086.USPS No. 4 135 086 discloses an automatic record player of a type which employs a linear tracking pickup arm. The position of the pickup arm is opto electrically detected by the use of a multi window scale and a photo coupler unit. Pre assigned position signals, which are stored in a memory, are compared with the detected position signal to control the movement of the pickup arm.USPS No. 3 740 055 discloses a record player including a record having a plurality of interleaved, spiral grooves each corresponding to items of information on a selection chart. An array of switches corresponding to individual items on the display and a position selector switch assembly operated by the position of the record relative to a tone arm cooperate to position the stylus of the tone arm in a spiral groove corresponding to the selected portion of the display.It is an object of the present invention to provide a new and useful computerized phonograph, that is, record player.It is another object of the present invention to provide a computerized record player which will automatically play an appropriate message in response to the actuation of predetermined keys on a keyboard.According to the present invention, a phonograph including a record having a plurality of recorded grooves, a respective lead in groove for each recorded groove and at least one run out groove provided thereon and a stylus for tracking the groove is provided with an encoder for generating electric signals corresponding to the location of each lead in groove, a micro processor connected to the encoder for processing electric signals received therefrom, a keyboard or the like connected to the microprocessor for selecting predetermined lead in grooves and a solenoid or the like connected to the microprocessor for converting processed signals into movement of the stylus into engagement with lead in grooves selected by the keyboard only at an appropriate time as indicated by the encoder. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the record player is controlled by a National Semiconductor brand COP 400 series microprocessor. The motor in the record player is switched by the microprocessor by means of a transistor. To ensure that the motor runs at the proper speed, a voltage regulating circuit supplies approximately 1.45 volts to the motor. Power to the regulator is supplied from a three volt source. The stylus position solenoid is also switched by means of a transistor, and it is also powered from the three volt supply.The encoder may be an optical encoder and may include an infra redLED and a phototransistor reading gaps on an optical track with a double gap being used as a reference gap.In the best mode presently contemplated for carrying out the invention, the keyboard comprises switches. All except one of these switches are read by the microprocessor by means of a conventional switch matrix. The remaining switch functions not only as an input switch but also activates the microprocessor s power switching circuit. Once the processor senses that power is up, it latches the power switching circuit on.The computerized record player of the present invention also includes a tonearm assembly having a tail piece, a pair of tonearms formed integrally with the tail piece, and two styli or needles depending one from each of the free ends of the tonearms. The distance between the needles is such that one needle may engage the run out groove while the other needle is positioned adjacent one of the lead in grooves at the periphery of the record.A speaker cone is coupled to the tonearm assembly for receiving vibrations therefrom and a tone arm lifting finger is also coupled to the tailpiece. This tone arm lifting finger has a first position wherein one of the needles is lifted above the record and a second position wherein the other needle is lifted above the record.A solenoid is mounted in the record player adjacent the finger and includes a fixed armature having first and second ends defining the first and second positions of the fingers. Permanent magnets are connected to the ends of the armature in the path of travel of the finger, so that one of the magnets may be energized by the coil to draw the finger into engagement with said one magnet for establishing one of said positions for said finger and the other magnet may be energized by a reversal of current in said coil to draw said finger into engagement with said other magnet for establishing the other of said positions for said finger.The record player may provide messages in indirect response to the actuation of keys on the keyboard or even without such an activation and thus simulate two sided conversation with the user. For example, as soon as the record player is energized, it may say, Good day, let s play a game . If no further input is received within 15 seconds, the record player might say, Please press a key to select a game . Then if no input is received within 15 seconds, the message may say, Since nobody wants to play, goodbye . The unit will then shut itself off. Thus, the device is capable of playing messages in response to a lack of a keyboard actuation.The record player may say, Spell cat C A T . If keys are pressed in proper sequence, the message is Very well, now spell... If either the letters or the sequence is wrong, the message is NO. That is not right. Try again. The features of the present invention which are believed to be novel are set forth with particularity in the appended claims. The present invention, both as to its organization and operation, together with further objects and advantages thereof, may best be understood by reference to the following description, taken in connection with the accompanying drawings in which like reference characters refer to like elements in the several views.Figure 1 is an exploded, perspective view of a computerized record player constituting a presently preferred embodiment of the invention in combination with the switches, wiring and microprocessor for the record player, which are shown schematically Figure 2 is an enlarged top plan view of the record player ofFigure 1 with parts broken away to show internal construction Figure 3 is a cross sectional view taken along line 3 3 of Figure 2 Figure 4 is a side elevational view taken along line 4 4 of Figure 2 andFigure 5 is a wiring diagram of the computerized control for the record player of Figure 1.A computerized record player constituting a presently preferred embodiment of the invention, generally designated 10, includes a disc type phonograph record 12 having a plurality of recorded grooves 14 Figure 2 , a respective lead in groove 16 for each recorded groove and a common run out groove 18 Figure 1 . As shown herein for purposes of illustration, but not of limitation, twelve recorded grooves are provided and they may contain suitable recorded information, such as recorded messages or short sayings.Twelve lead in grooves 16 are also provided and they are uniformly spaced about the periphery of record 12.Record player 10 also includes a dual tone arm assembly 20 which may be of Y shaped design including a tail piece 22, which is provided with an aperture 23, a pair of tonearms 24, 26 and a pair of phonograph styli in the form of needles 30, 32 depending from the free ends of tonearms 24, 26, respectively. The distance between needles 30, 32 is such that one needle will be positioned over run out groove 18 when the other needle is positioned over a lead in groove 16 at the periphery of record 12. A speaker cone 34 may be affixed to tonearm assembly 20 by a cylindrical coupling member 36 engaging speaker cone 34 at its apex.Needles 30, 32 may be lifted from record 12 by a magnetic tone armlifting finger 38 having a north end 40 and a south end 42, which is provided with an aperture 44.Tonearm assembly 20, which may be made from a suitable dielectric material, and finger 38, which may be made from a suitable magnetizable material, are swingably mounted in record player 10 on a suitable post 46 having an upper end 48 to which an upstanding pivot pin 49 is affixed for connecting post 46 to upper housing wall 50 and for receiving aperture 44 of finger 38 and aperture 23 of tonearm assembly 20.

The assembly comprising solenoid 56 and pole pieces 66, 68 may be affixed to housing wall 54 by a suitable dielectric spacer 74.Referring now to Figure 3, record player 10 also includes a turntable 76 carried by a spindle 78 having its upper end 80 rotatably mounted in upper housing wall 50 and its lower end 82 rotatably mounted in lower housing wall 54. Turntable 76 carries record 12 and may be provided with a belt groove 84 adapted to receive a belt 86 for rotating turntable 76. Spindle 78 includes an increased diameter portion 88 at its lower end which carries an optical disc 90 having a plurality of teeth 92 corresponding in number and location to the lead in grooves 16 on record 12.Disc 90 also includes a reference tooth 93 Figures 1 and 2 which is positioned between two teeth 92 for establishing a point of reference with respect to the rotated position of record 12.Teeth 92 and tooth 93 are read by an optical encoder 94 including an infra red LED 96 and a phototransistor 98 which is connected to a microprocessor 100 Figure 1 . As shown in Figure 2, record 12 is driven in the direction of arrow 102 by an electric motor 104 which is also connected via pnp transistor 110, Figure 5, omitted from Fig. 1 to microprocessor 100, which may be a NationalSemiconductor COP 400 series microprocessor to which a keyboard 106 is connected for selecting predetermined lead in grooves 16 on record 12.Referring now to Figure 5, solenoid 56 and motor 104 receive power from a three volt battery 108. Motor 104 is switched by microprocessor 100 by means of the pnp transistor 110 which has its base connected to output 111 on microprocessor 100 by a lead 112. Solenoid 56, which is also powered from battery 108, is switched by a pnp transistor 114 also omitted from Fig. 1 connected to microprocessor 100 by a lead 116.Infra red LED 96 is connected to a ground 118 by a lead 120 and to a resistor 122 by a lead 123. Resistor 122 is connected to the collector 124 in a pnp transistor 126 by a conductor 128.Phototransistor 98 is connected to a ground 130 by a lead 132 and to a resistor 134 by a lead 136. Resistor 134 is connected to conductor 128 by a lead 138. Conductor 128 is connected to the Vcc on microprocessor 100 by a lead 140.A 9 volt battery 142 is connected to a ground 144 by a lead 146 and to a resistor 152 by a conductor 54. The emitter 156 on transistor 126 is connected to conductor 154 by a lead 158 and the base 160 in transistor 126 is connected to a conductor 162 below resistor 152 by a lead 164. A resistor 166 is connected to conductor 162 by a lead 168 and to the open drain output in microprocessor 100 by a lead 170. A diode 172 connects conductor 162 to a lead 174 having one end connected to a diode 176 and its other end connected to a pole 178 on a normally open switch 180 which includes a pushbutton 182 and a second pole 184. Pole 184 is connected to a ground 186 by a lead 188. Diode 176 is connected to an input 190 in microprocessor 100 by a lead 192.Keyboard 106 includes a switch matrix 194 having switches 195, 196, 197, 198, 199 and 200. A lead 202 connects switches 195, 196 and 197 to an input 204 in microprocessor 100 and a lead 206 connects switches 198, 199 and 200 to input 204. A conductor 208 connects an output 210 in microprocessor 100 to switches 195 and 200 a conductor 212 connects output 210 to switches 196 and 199 and a conductor 214 connects output 210 to switches 197 and 198. Lead 136 is connected to an input 216 by a lead 218 and to a collector 220 in phototransistor 98 by a lead 222. It is apparent from the foregoing that power to the optical encoder 94 is taken from Vcc at microprocessor 100.Operation of the computerized record player is believed to be apparent from the foregoing and will be briefly summarized at this point.Switch 180 may be momentarily closed to activate the power switching circuit in microprocessor 100. Once the microprocessor senses that power is up, it latches the power switching circuit on.Assuming that tone arm lifting finger 38 is in the broken line position shown in Figure 4 so that needle 30 will be riding in the silent run out groove, one of the buttons may be depressed on keyboard 106 switching motor 104 on. A delay of 255 ms is executed while motor 104 comes up to speed. Optical encoder 94 then starts generating electric signals corresponding to the location of each lead in groove 16. The input from phototransistor 98 is then continuously read and debounced with an 18 ms time constant until a gap is detected. When a gap is detected, a 10 ms delay is executed. If another gap is read at this point, it means that the double gap at reference 93 has been detected.Then all succeeding gaps are counted as valid track indices.As each single gap is detected, a 10 ms delay is executed to prevent the same gap from being read twice.When the number of gaps read equals the requested track numbers, solenoid 56 is enabled for 20 ms causing pole 68 to recoil magnet 38 into holding engagement with pole 66. This lowers needle 32 into the selected lead in groove 16, as shown in Figure 3.After solenoid 56 is deactivated, pole 66 continues holding magnet 38 and needle 32 tracks the selected recording inwardly to run out groove 18. Motor 104 is then deactivated and control is returned to the main program in microprocessor 100. While the particular computerized record player herein shown and described in detail is fully capable of attaining the objects and providing the advantages hereinbefore stated, it is to be understood that it is merely illustrative of the presently preferred embodiment of the invention and that no limitations are intended to the details of construction or design herein shown other than as defined in the appended claims which form a part of this disclosure.Whenever the term means is employed in these claims, this term is to be interpreted as defining the corresponding structure illustrated and described in this Specification or the equivalent of the same.
