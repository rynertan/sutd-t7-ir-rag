# One pot process for preparation of 7beta amino and 7beta acylamino 3 substituted methyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylic acid derivatives and process for deoxygenation of 7beta acylamino 3 cephem 4 carboxylic acid 1 oxide derivatives.

## Abstract
Multi step one pot process for the preparation of inter alia 7β amino and 7β acylamino 3 substituted methyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylic acid derivatives starting from 7β acylamino 3 methyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylic acid 1β oxide derivatives, comprising a new process for deoxygenation of generally 7β acylamino 3 cephem 4 carboxylic acid 1 oxide derivatives optionally substituted in the 7α position, which can be applied as single step or can be incorporated in multistep processes without isolation of intermediates. The deoxygenation involves the use of phosphorus pentachloride and an olefine for removal of chlorine at least in part by addition to carbon carbon double bond. Preferred aspects are lasting protection of reactive substituents by silylation and preparation on industrial scale of generally 7β amino 3 heterocyclic thiomethyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylic acids starting from suitably 7β phenyl acetamido 3 methyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylic acid 1β oxide.
