# TRANSFORMER COUPLED, SOLID STATE COMMUNICATION LINE SWITCH

## Abstract
A plurality of signal coupling transformers and a plural ity of solid state switches are used to insert and or de insert data terminal equipment DTE from a communications net work. The solid state switches are controlled to short the output of selected transformers thereby allowing signals on the communications network to bypass the DTE and or to be switched into the DTE. The DTE may also loop electrical signals from its output to its input.
