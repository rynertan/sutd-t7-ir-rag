# Electron tube.

## Abstract
An electron tube comprises a tubular glass envelope portion 10 having a central axis m and an inside diameter D. In the envelope portion 10 an electrode system 13 is inserted, the central axis 1 of which coincides with the central axis m. The electrode system 13 comprises a number of resilient elements 16 extending towards the wall of the envelope portion 10 and each pressing against a respective wall portion 19 thereof. The wall portions 19 are a distance R₁ D ₂ from the central axis m. In the non assembled condition of the electrode system, the free ends 18 of the elements 16 are a distance R₂ from the central axis 1, the relation R₁ R₂ D ₂ being satisfied. This measure permits preventing the occurrence of damage to the wall of the envelope portion 10 when the electrode system 13 is inserted into it.
