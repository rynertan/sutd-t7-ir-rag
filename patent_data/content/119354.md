# Vane for use in monitoring the flow of a fluid, and method of manufacturing this vane.

## Abstract
A flowmeter has a vane which is caused to vibrate at one of its resonant frequencies and a flexure standing wave set up along it. Two piezoelectric sensors are used to mon itor characteristics of the standing wave and hence the mass flow rate of a fluid flowing past the vane along a pipe. The vane comprises a ceramic planar member 1 on which a conductive ceramic ink is laid down to form tracks 10 and 11 . The ink also bonds a ceramic piezoelectric transducer 4 to the member 1 to drive and maintain it in vibration. A non conductive layer 14 is laid down on the surface of the member 1 covering the conductive tracks 10 and 11 surrounding the transducer 4 . A metal layer 13 forms the external surface of the vane and acts as a ground plane for the transducer 4 .
