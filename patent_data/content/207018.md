# Method of fabricating an imaging x ray spectrometer.

## Abstract
A process for fabricating a spectrometer having imag ing and energy resolution of X ray sources. The spec trometer has an array of adjoining rectangularly shaped de tector cells 16 formed in a silicon body 10. The walls 18, 20 of the cells are created by laser drilling holes completely through the silicon body and diffusing n phosphorous doping material therethrough. A thermally migrated alumi num electrode 28 is formed centrally through each of the cells.
