# Monolithic integration of light emitting elements and driver electronics.

## Abstract
The invention relates to the fabrication of modules consisting of a number of light emitting elements 10 and the associated driver electronics 11 integrated on a com mon conductive p type Gallium Arsenide substrate 12 . The use of a number of such modules to form in a recording head an uninterrupted row of light emitting elements is furth ermore disclosed.
