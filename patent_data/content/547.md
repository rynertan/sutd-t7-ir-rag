## Description
NOVEL POLYCARBONATE COMPOSITIONS ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE A copolycarbonate is provided based on aromatic diphenol and an aromatic sulfonyl diphenol. By incorporatiing an effective amount of an aromatic sulfonyl diphenol, based on the total diphenol content, having a 4,4 isomer purity of at least about 53 wt. 9 irt the polymer, the heat deflection temperature cf the copolycarbonate is substantially improved. In a preferred emodiment, the copolycarbonate is reinforced with glass fibers to provide an advanced engineering composite having good physical properties, especially imprcsred heat deflection temperatures. NOVEL POLYCARBONATE COMPOSITIONS see front page FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to polycarbonate polymers and more particularly to polycarbonate copolymers having improved heat deflection temperatures and gooc physical properties. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Polycarbonates derived from reactions involving organic dihydroxy compounds and carbonic acid derivatives have found extensive commercial application because of their excellent mechanical and physical properties. These thermoplastic polymers are particularly suited for the manufacture of molded articles where impact strength, rigidity, toughness, thermal and dimensional stability as well as excellent electrical properties are required. However, one deficiency of polycarbonate when used in molded articles is the heat deflection temperature of the polycarbonate polymer. As determined by ASTM D 648 72, the heat deflection temperature defines the temperature at which a 0.25 mm deflection occurs when a specimens127 mm in length, 13 mm in depth and 3 my to 13 mm in width are sub jected to a load applied at its center to give maximum fiber stresses of 66 psi 455 k Pa or 264 psi 1820 k Pa . Typical polycarbonates known in the prior art exhibit heat deflection temperatures of from about 135 to 141or at a 264 psi load. In accordance with the present invention, a copolye carbonate is provided with improved heat deflection temperas ture and good physical properties. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A copolycarbonate having improved heat deflection temperatures along with good physical properties is provided which is comprised of the reaction product of an aromatic diphenol, an effective amount of an aromatic sulfonyl diphenol to improve the heat deflection temperature and a carbonic acid derivative such as phosgene or carbonyl bromide. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION When used herein, the term copolycarbonate resin means the neat resin without additives, and the term co polycarbonate means the copolycarbonate resin with additives therein. The copolycarbonate resin of the invention may be prepared by conventional methods of preparation for polycarbonate resins and may have a weight average molecular weight of 10,000 to 200,000 and preferably have a melt flow rate of about 1 to 24 gm 10 min., most preferably about 2 6 gm 10 min., at 300 C according to ASTM D 1238. Any suitable process, reactant, catalyst, solvent, reaction conditions and the like for the production of the copolycarbonate resins of the present invention which are customarily employed in polycarbonate resin synthesis may be used, such as disclosed in German Patent Nos, 962w274 and 1,046,311 and U.S. Patent Nos. 2,964f794 2,970,131 2,991,273 2999,846 3,028,365 3,153,008 3,187,065 3,215,668 and 3,248,414, all incorporated herein by refer rence. The preferred process is the interfacial polZcondenv sation process. According to the interfacial polycondensation prowess copolycarbonate resins are obtained by reacting the aro matic dihydroxy compounds with an alkali metal hydroxLde or alkaline earth metal oxide or hydroxide to form the salt of the hydroxy compounds. The salt mixture is present in an aqueous solution or suspension and is reacted with phosgene, carbonyl bromide, or bischloroformic esters of the aromatic dihydroxy compound An organic solvent is provided in the reaction admixture s which is a solvent for the polymer but not for the aromatic dihydroxy salts. Thus, chlorinated and non chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons are used as the organic solvent which dissolves the condensation product.Suitable solvents include cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, benzene, toluene, xylene, methylene chloride, chloroform, carbon tetra chloride and chlorobenzene. In order to limit the molecular weight, one may use monofunctional reactants such as monophenols, for example, the propyl , isopropyl and butyl phenols, especially p tert butyl phenol and phenol itself. In order to aeeele rate the reaction, catalysts such as tertiary amines, quaternary ammonium, phosphonium or arsonium salts and the like may be used. The reaction temperature should be about 200C to 1500C, preferably OOC to about 1000C. According to the polycondensation process in a homo geneous phase, the dissolved reaction components are polyp condensed in an inert solvent in the presence of an equivalent amount of a tertiary amine base required for absorption of the generated HCl, such as e.g. N,N dimethyl aniline, N,N dimethyl cyclohexylamine or prefer ably pyridine and the like.. In still another. process, a diaryl carbonate can be transesterified with the aromatic dihydroxy compounds to form the polycarbonate resin. It is to be understood that it is possible to combine in a chemically meanigful way in the processes described above both the aromatic dihydroxy compounds and the mono hydroxy compounds in the form if alkali metal salts and or bis haloformic acid esters, and the amount of phosgene or carbonyl bromide then still required in order to obtain high molecular weight products. Other methods of synthesis in forming the polycarbonates of the invention such as disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,912,688, incorporated herein by reference, may also be used. The aromatic diphenols useful in the practice of the invention include the following compounds hydroquinone resorcinol, dihydroxydiphenyl, bis hydroxyphenyl alkanes, bis hydroxyphenyl cycloalkanes, bis hydroxyphenyl sulphides, bis hydroxyphenyl ethers, bis hydroxyphenyl ketones, bis hydroxyphenyl sulphoxides and CL dL bis hydroxy phenyl diisopropylbenzenes, as well as their nuclear alkylated and nuclear halogenated compounds. These and further suitable aromatic dihydroxy compounds are described, for exampJe, ln U.S. Patent Nos, 3,028,365, 2,999,835, 3,148,172, 3,271,368, 2,991,273, 3,271,367, 3,280,078, 3,014,891 and 2,999,846 all incorporated herein by reference S German Offenlegungsschriften German Published Specifications 1,570,703, 2,063,050, 2,063,052, 2,211,956 and 2,211,957, in French PatentSpecification 1,561,518 and in the monograph H. Schnell, Chemistry and Physics of Polycarbonates, Interscience Publishers, New York, t964 . Preferred bisphenols are those of the formula IEMI6.1 in which R is identical or different and denotes H, C1 C4alkyl, Cl or Br, preferably H or C1 C4 alkyl, and in which X is a bond, C1 C8 alkylene, C2 C8 alkylidene, C5 C15 cycloalkylene, C5 C15 cycloalkylidene, S , SO , CO orEMI6.2 Examples of these bisphenols are 4,4 dihydroxydiP phenyl, 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane bisphenol A , 2,4 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl 2 methylbutane, 1,1 bis 4 hydroxy phenyl cyclohexane, alpha , alpha bis 4 hydroxyphenyl p diisopropyl benzene, 2, 2 bis 3 methyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propane, 2,2 bis 3 chloro 4 hydroxyphenyl propane, bis 3,5 dimethyl 4 hydroxyphenyl methane, 2,2 bis 3,5 dimethyl 4hydroxyphenyl propane, bis 3 , 5 dimethyl 4 hydroxyphenyl sulphoxide, hydroxy benzophenone, 2,4 bis 3,5 dimethyl 4hydroxyphenyl 2 methylbutane, 1,1 bis 3, 5 dimethyl 4hydroxyphenyl cyclohexane, a ,L bis 3 ,5 dimethyl 4 hydroxyphenyl p diisopropyl benzene, 2,2, bis 3,5 dichloro4 hydroxyphenyl propane and 2,2 bis 3,5 dibromo 4hydroxyphenyl propane tetrabromo bisphenol A propane. Examples of particularly preferred bisphenols are 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane, 2, 2 is 3, 5 dimethl 4 hydroxyphenyl propane, 2,2 bis 3,5 dichloro 4 hydroxyphenyl propane, 2,2 bis 3,5 dibromo 4 hydroxyphenyl propane and 1,1 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl cyclohexane. The most preferred bisphenol is 2,2, bis 4hydroxyphenyl propane bisphenol A . The aromatic sulfonyl diphenols useful in the practice of the invention are those represented by the struc EMI7.1 having a 4,4 isomer purity of at least about 99.9 wt. wherein n O to 2, and R1 and R2 may be the same or different and are H, C1 C4 alkyl, Cl or Br, and are present in the copolycarbonate in an effective flmbunt, based on the total diphenol content, to improve the heat deflection temperature and mechanical properties of the polycarbonate. Preferably, the aromatic sulfonyl diphenols are present in about 1 to 50 wt. , based on the total weight of diphenols, and most preferably from about 1 to 20 wt. . The aromatic copolycarbonate resins can be branched due to the incorporation of small amounts, preferably of between about 0.05 and 2.0 mol relative to diphenols employed , of trifunctional or more than trifunctional com poundsr especially compounds with three tor more phenolic hydroxyl groups. Polycarbonate resins of this type are described, for example, in German Offenlegungsschriften German Publisched Specifications 1,570,533, 1,595,762, 2,116,974 and 2,13, 347, British Patent Specification 1,079,821 and U.S.Reissue Patent 27,682 incorporated herein by reference . Some examples of compounds with three or more than three phenolic hydroxyl groups which can be used are phoroglucinol, 4,6 dimethyl 2,4,6 tri 4 hydroxyphenyl heptene2, 4,6 dimethyl 2,4,6 tri 4 hydroxyphenyl hepane, 1,4,5 tri 4 hydroxyphenyl benzene, 1,1,1 tri 4 hydroxyphenyl ethane,tri 4 hydroxyphenyl phenylmethane,2,2bis 4,4 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl cyclohexyl propane, 2,4 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl isopropyl phenol,2,6 bi 2 hydroxy 5 methyl benzyl 4 methylphenol, 2 4 hydroxyphenyl 2 2,4 dihydroxyphenyl propane, hexa 4 4 hydroxyphenylisopropyl phenyl ortho terephthalic acid ester, tetra 4 hydroxyphenyl methane, tetra 4 4 hydroxyphenylisopropyl phenoxy methane and 1,4 bis 4 4, dihydroxytriphenyl methyl benzene.Some of the other trifunctional compounds are 2,4 dihydroxybenzoic acid, trimesic acid, cyanuric chloride and 3,3 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl 2 oxo 2, 3 dihydroindole. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the copolycarbonate may be reinforced with glass fibers, preferably present in from about 5 to 40 by weight, most preferably in from about 10 to 30 by weight, based on the weight of the total composition. Glass fibers which can be used in the present invention are, for example, fibers of low alkali, aluminum borosilicate glass having a maximum alkali metal oxide content of about 0.2 by weight Eglass , of diameter between about 8 15 u and length beb tween about 300 and 8001u short glass fibers or about 2000 to 12,000,u chopped strands as well as rovings. The copolycarbonates of the present invention may also contain other conventional resin additives such as pigments, dyes, UV stabilizers, thermal stabilizers, mold release agents and fillers. Any additives, including glass fibers, may be blended with the copolycarbonate resin in known mixing devices such as kneaders, single screw extruders, twin screw extruders, mills and the like. Surprisingly, the oopolycarbonate resins of the invention not only exhibit physical properties similar to standard bisphenol A based polycarbonates, but also exihibit heat deflection temperatures which are about 5 8 C higher than those of standard bisphenol A based polycarbonates.Although this improvement in heat deflection temperature may not at first glance appear to be significant, it is noted that this about 5 80C increase is quite significant for it enlarges the high temperature applications in which aromatic polycarbonates are suitable. Based on past experience, this about 5 8 C increase is believed to equate to an about 10 20 C increase in continuous service temperature under normal part loading. It is noted that the 264 psi ASTM D 648 72 test loading is an extreme torture test condition and not one generally encountered in actual use. Furthermore, reinforcement of the copolycarbonate with glass fibers yields an advanced engineering composite which exhibits a similar improvement in heat deflection temperature and an improvement in adhesion properties of the copolycarbonate resin to the glass fibers as illustrar ted by the higher tensile strength, higher resistance to bending and somewhat lower ductility drop dart . This particular combination of properties is desirable for applications such as power tool housings. With respect to the glass fiber reinforced copolycarbonates of the invention, it is noted that the heat deflection temperature and the tensile strength iflrrovernents, while apparently modest, are in actuality quite significant when taken in combination with the other properties, especially ductility. All glass fiber reinforced thermo plastics, with the exception of polycarbonate, are brittle.Composites based on a polycarbonate matrix are ductile, but are excluded from use in certain applications because of relatively minor deficiencies in tensile strength, stiffness as measured by E modulus and continuous use temperature as measured by heat deflection temperature .The glass fiber reinforced composites of the instant invention, based on aromatic diphenol aromatic sulfonyl diphenol copolymers, correct the above described deficient cies while retaining substantial ductility and all the other useful properties of conventional polyearbonate composites including moldability, excellent surface appearance, low moisture absorption, good dimensional stability, good electrical properties and the like. Since all previous attempts to raise the heat deflection temper rature have resulted in a significant loss of ductility and or some other important property, the present results herein reported are suprising and unexpected. Although copolycarbonates and terpolycarbonates based on aromatic sulfonyl diphenols are known in the prior art see W.S. Patent Nos. 3,023,101, 3,271,367 and 3,912,688 , the aromatic sulfonyl diphenols used in those polymers have a 4,4 isomer purity of less than about 90 wt. 8. In order to improve the heat deflection temperature, it is essential that aromatic sulfonyl diphenols have a 4,4 isomer purity of at least about 99.9 wt. . The prior art copolymers and terpolymers will not, therefore, exhibit the improved heat deflection temperatures exhibited by the copolycarbonates of the present invention. The invention will be further illustrated, but is not intended to be limited, by the following examples. EXAMPLESEXAMPLE 1 A copolycarbonate resin was prepared by reacting a mixture of the disodium salts of 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane bisphenol A and 4,4 sulfonyl diphenol greater than 99.9 isomer purity with phosgene in accordance with the interfacial polycondensation synthesis hereinbefore discussed. 5 wt. of 4,4 sulfonyl diphenol and 95 wt. 8 of bisphenol A, based on the weight of the diphenols, were used.
