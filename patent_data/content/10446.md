# Track roller assembly.

## Abstract
A track roller assembly for a crawler vehicle includes a track roller frame 12 defining an elongate tunnel. A pair of spaced, elongate rails extend through the tunnel, and a stop 26 is provided at one end of the tunnel. A spring recoil assembly 20 within the tunnel is in abutment with the stop 26 and is supported by the rails. The spring recoil assembly 20 includes a housing 28 containing a compression spring 30 , and a movable plate 36 exposed through an opening 32 in the housing remote from the stop and abutting the spring to receive a reaction from the spring. A hydraulic adjus ter assembly 22 is provided within the tunnel and is sup ported by the rails in abutment with, but not attached to, the housing 28 . The adjuster assembly 22 includes a closed hydraulic chamber with a movable piston 104 extending therefrom and through the opening to abut the movable plate. An idler yoke 24 within the tunnel and supported by the rails abuts, but is not attached to, the adjuster assembly at its end remote from the spring recoil assembly 20 .
