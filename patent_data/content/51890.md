## Description
An apparatus for filling bottles and a filling valve thereof.The invention relates to an apparatus for filling bottles with liquid under low pressure, comprising a filling tank provided, in or around its bottom, with a carousel of filling valves each constructed from a fixed housing and a composite hollow body disposed therein so as to be displaceable between a filling position and a closing position against spring pressure and adapted to cooperate at its bottom with the neck of a bottle to be filled, said body cooperating with a liquid valve to be closed against slight spring pressure, the housing bearing a central gas pipe which extends through the hollow body and, at one end, into a bottle to be filled and, at the other end, above the level of liquid inside the filling tank, said gas pipe being adapted to be opened or closed by an operable shutoff valve.An apparatus of this kind, usually called a bottle filler , is known in various constructions and is also referred to as an isobarometric filler.It is an object of the invention to provide an apparatus suitable more particularly, for use with liquid in the form of beverages or drinks having a slight C02 content e.g. wine , Hitherto it was usually necessary to provide special operation of the gas valve and or the liquid valve in order to determine the beginning and end of the filling operation. It is a primary object of the present invention to provide a filler whereby the entire filling process can be controlled and terminated by the bottle itself. To this end, according to the invention, the displaceably disposed composite hollow body cooperates with the gas valve and is also provided with an element in the form of a bridge which during its upward movement opens the gas valve and which in the closed position of the body also shuts the liquid valve.As a result of these measures, when the filling valve is brought into contact with the neck of the bottle, the composite hollow body will be displaced, as a result of which the gas valve will be opened and a pressure equalization occurs between the filling tank and the bottle. In this way, the liquid valve which is kept closed by the pressure difference can be opened as a result of the spring pressure present, so that filling can take place. This filling operation stops automatically when the level of liquid in the neck of the bottle reaches the lower end of the gas pipe. If the bottle is then moved downwards with respect to the filling valve, the said hollow body slides back, the gas valve closes by its own weight, and the body then pushes the liquid valve in its closed position against the spring action.It is another advantage of the invention that the spring pressure exerted on the liquid valve cannot come into operation before the liquid valve is opened, with complete pressure equalization between the tank and the bottle. In this way, filling can. not take place with a damaged bottle.The invention also relates to a filling valve for use in the above described apparatus, in which in a known manner the fixed housing is constructed from an outer part which can be secured in a wall and an inner part which supports the gas pipe which has a widened portion in which an annular seat is formed for the liquid valve.According to the invention, this filling valve is characterized in that the liquid valve is constructed with a tubular extension which on the one hand cooperates with an internal compression spring for opening the valve and which on the other hand abuts against the bridge shaped element of the displaceable hollow body, above which element a bracket shaped member is disposed for actuating the shut off valve of the gas pipe. This bridgeshaped element will open the gas valve, via the bracket shaped member, in order to initiate the filling process. After termination of the filling operation, the body moves downwards, the bridge shaped element releasing the gas valve so that this valve can close by its own weight.The tubular extension of the liquid valve enables a compression spring to be fitted there, said compression spring being used to open the liquid valve. The small force of the compression spring is overcome by the downwardly moving bridge shaped element on removal of the filled bottle. This provides a positive closure of the liquid valve.According to another aspect of the invention, the filling apparatus obviates any leakage of aroma and any loss of alcohol content and parents any oxidation of the liquid. In addition it is also desirable to avoid any turbulence of the surface of the liquid in the filling tank and to prevent any contact between the return gas from the bottles and the liquid. For this purpose, according to the invention, the rotatable tank is provided with a horizontal partition plate above the level of the liquid in said tank, said partition plate being provided with a stationary closure plate with some clearance, said closure plate being provided with a protective gas supply pipe, a gas discharge duct with an adjustable passage being connected to the top point of the tank.In a tank constructed in this way, a protective gas, e.g.nitrogen or C02, can be supplied beneath the partition plate.The return air from the bottles is taken via conventional connecting conduits between the gas pipe of each filling valve and the tank, to the part of the tank situated above the partition plate, and is then discharged. In this way any undesirable gas exchange at the level of the liquid in the tank is avoided. The clearance between the closure plate and the partition plate enables a stationary closure plate to be used in a partition plate co rotating with the tank.Preferably, the top surface of the filling tank is closed by a lid provided with a central assembly block in which a spray member together with the adjustable gas discharge is secured, while the protective gas supply pipe is passed displaceably through the block. The closure plate in the partition plate can be raised by drawing up the supply pipe, whereafter the interior of the filling tank can be completely cleaned.The invention will be explained in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, which show a number of details of the filling apparatus and the valve, wherein Fig. 1 is a longitudinal section in two mutually perpendicular planes through a filling valve constructed according to the invention and fitted in the bottom of a filling tank Fig. 2 is a vertical section through a central filling tank provided with connections for a carousel of filling valves mounted outside the same, the valves being shown in the operative position during the filling of bottles Fig. 3 is a cross section similar to Fig. 2 in which the filling operation has been interrupted and the tank can be cleaned internally.The filling valve illustrated in Fig. 1 is fitted in the bottom 1 of a filling tank 2 which is not fully shown in this figure .The valve is fitted therein in the conventional manner. A carousel of filling valves of this kind, e.g. twelve or sixteen of such valves, is fitted in the bottom 1 in the usual way.Each filling valve is constructed from a fixed housing 3 and a composite hollow body 4 displaceable in said housing between a filling position and a closure position. Fig. 1 shows the filling valve in its open position, which is also defined by a stop which will be described hereinafter. The downward movement of the body is produced by means of an external spring 5.The housing 3 also supports a central gas pipe 6 which extends through the hollow body 4 and into a bottle to be filled, at one end, while its other end projects above the level of liquid inside the filling tank 2. From its lower side the hollow body 4 is composed of a rubber centering member 7 and a cylinder 8 which is guided along the inner side of the housing. The upward movement of the composite hollow body 4 towards the so called filling position is limited by said stop still to be described hereinafter. The fixed housing 3 is constructed from an outer part 9 which can be secured in a wall, e.g. the bottom of the filling tank 2, and an inner part forming the middle portion of the gas pipe 6. The latteB N urther comprises a widened portion 10 in which there is formed an annular seat 11 consisting of a ring of converging liquid ducts 12. The actual liquid valve 13 is also annular and is constructed with a tubular extension 14.A lid 14 is fitted thereon and is supported by and guided along the central innermost part of the housing 3. An internal compression spring 14 exerts a force for opening the liquid valve 13. The underside of the widened portion 10 forms the fixed stop referred to hereinbefore, against which the composite body 4 abuts when the valve 13 is pushed into its open filling position.The displaceably disposed composite body 4 is provided with an element 15 in the form of a bridge which, when the body 4 is in the closing position, pushes the liquid valve 13 into its closed position via the extension 14. The bridge shaped element 15 encloses the central innermost part of the housing 3 and is further fully open to allow the passage of the filling liquid.Above the bridge shaped element 15 there is provided a bracketshaped member 16 for actuation of a shut off valve 17 of the gas pipe 6.The displaceably disposed composite hollow body 4 is provided at its lower side with a filling tube 18 disposed concentrically of the gas pipe 6. Near its bottom end the gas pipe comprises a conical dispersion member 19 which, when the valve 17 is in the closed position, leaves only a narrow gap free with respect to the filling tube 18. In the filling position, in which the body 4 together with the tube 18 has been moved upwards, the filling tube 18 is lifted to above the dispersion member 19 in order to provide a uniform flow of liquid against the inner wall of a bottle to be filled. Body 4 conventionally also comprises a sealing ring 20 connected to said body 4.The apparatus described thus far operates as follows As soon as the neck of a bottle has entered the centering member 7 and presses against the sealing ring 20, the composite body 4 moves upwards until an internal collar 21 thereof abuts against the widened portion 10 of the middle part of the gas pipe 6. During this displacement, the bridge shaped element 15 moves in the upward direction and moves away from the liquid valve 13, 14. The shut off valve 17 of the gas pipe 6 will also be opened via the bracket shaped member 16. An absolute pressure of not more than about 2 bar is maintained inside the filling tank 2 so that pressure equalization can take place between the gas chamber in the filling tank and the bottle to be filled, via the open gas pipe 6.During this pressure equalization, the pressures on either side of the liquid valve 13 are also equalized, so that the internal spring 14 opens the liquid valve 13 and the filling operation starts. This filling operation continues until the liquid level inside the bottle has reached the underside of the gas pipe 6.If the bottle is then removed by a downward movement, the body 4 will also slide back to its closing position. This means that the bridge shaped element 15 positively closes the liquid valve 13 by the contact between the extension 14 and the bridge shaped element 15. The dispersion member 19 returns inside the filling tube 18 and there is no liquid leakage.The filling apparatus shown in fig. 1 has a relatively low capacity because a limited number of filling valves can be mounted in the bottom of the filling tank. On the other hand the embodiment of figs. 2 and 3 shows a filling tank 2 with a bottom 1, in which the filling valves are not directly arranged in the bottom but at some distance from the filling tank on a separate mounting plate 22, as is conventional in this field of the art. In this manner more filling valves can be arranged so as to provide an apparatus with a larger capacity. A carousel of these filling valves is disposed around the filling tank 2 and each is constructed as described with refvrence to fig. 1. Each filling valve is connected to the central filling tank 2 via a liquid tube 23 near the bottom, and a gas pipe 24 at the top. In an embodiment of this kind the interior of the tank 2 may be provided with a horizontal partition plate 25 above the level of the liquid in said tank. The partition plate may have a flat or slightly conical shape. Said partition plate comprises a closure plate 26 provided with a supply pipe 27 for a protective gas, e.g. nitrogen or carbon dioxide. A liquid level control 28 and a spray member 29 with spray nozzles 30 also extend through closure plate 26, with some clearance.The top surface of the filling tank 2 is closed by a loose lid 31 which can be sealed by means of clamping units 32. Lid 31 is provided with a central assembly block 33 in which the spray member 29 and an adjustable gas discharge 34 are secured. The latter element is used to discharge the air from the bottles to be filled. The quantity of protective gas applied is also controlled thereby. The protective gas supply pipe 27 is guided through the block 33 so as to be displaceaXie and therefore also acts as an actuating means for opening and closing the closure plate 26. Fig. 2 shows the position with the closure plate closed while fig. 3 shows the closure plate opened with a spacer 35 memb inserted. In this position the spray 2together with the spray nozzles 30 can operate to clean the interior of the filling tank 2.Before this cleaning operation is carried out, the filling liquid is obviously discharged from the tank 2. The advantage of the partition plate 25 is that the return air from the filling valves flowing back into the tank 2 either directly fig. 1 or via the gas pipes 24 figs. 2 and 3 can not cause any turbulence or exert any other adverse influence e.g. oxidation or infection on the liquid for filling inside the tank 2. Furthermore, the quantity of protective gas required above the liquid for filling is substantially reduced. Fig. 3 additionally shows how the connections of the gas pipes 24 in the wall of the rotating tank 2 are cleaned by means of the stationary spray nozzle 30 . For the sake of completeness, it should be noted that the cleaning liquid is fed to the spray member 29 via a connection 36 while the liquid in the tank 2 for filling the bottles is fed via a central pipe 37.
