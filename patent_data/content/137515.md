# BIOLUMINESCENT IMMUNOASSAYS

## Abstract
A process for detecting ligand ligand interactions such as antigen antibody, hapten antibody, hormone receptor, protein nucleic acid, and nucleic acid nucleic acid utilizing a coelenterate derived luciferase or a coelenterate derived photoprotein which is a bioluminescent, low molecular weight, single polypeptide chain as a label in a bioluminesc ence linked immunoassay is disclosed. The disclosed pro cess is rapid and process provides greater sensitivity over existing processes. Also, the disclosed process utilizes labels and reagents which possess a shelf life of years. Three types of bioluminescence lined immunoassays are disclosed heterogeneous assay requiring a single separation step, homogeneous assay without separation step requiring dual wavelength measurements, and a homogeneous assay without a separation step requiring a single wavelength measurement.
