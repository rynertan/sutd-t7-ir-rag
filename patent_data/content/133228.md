# Improvements relating to obstetric chairs.

## Abstract
An obstetric chair comprising a chair proper 10 car ried by a support comprising a base frame 15 supported on braked castor wheels 16 and including two triangulated linkages of which the first comprises legs 17, 18 pivotally connected about horizontal axes 20, 21 to the base frame 15 with the former axis also capable of horizontal transla tory movement lengthwise of the frame, and a second trian gulated linkage comprising leg 17 , extension thereof 17a and tie member 24 together with a part of the back portion 12 of the chair proper. The geometry of the first linkage can be varied by a hydraulic ram 31 which raises and lowers the pivotal apex 19 and hence the chair proper and the geometry of the second linkage can be varied by adjusting the effective length of the tie member 24 which comprises cooperating screw threaded components 24a, 24b rela tively rotatable by a handle 25 .
