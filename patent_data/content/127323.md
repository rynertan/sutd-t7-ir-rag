# A process for producing a single crystal semiconductor island on an insulator.

## Abstract
A process for producing a single crystal semiconductor island 4 on an insulator 2, comprises the steps of providing a semiconductor island 4 of a non monocrystalline semicon ductor on the insulator 2 forming an energy absorbing cap layer 7 which coats at least the upper and side surfaces of the semiconductor island 4 irradiating the energy absorbing cap layer 7 with an energy beam and melting and transform ing the coated non monocrystalline semiconductor 4 into a single crystal semiconductor with the heat generated in the energy absorbing cap layer 7. Since the cap layer 7 which surrounds both the upper and side surfaces of the island 4 is heated by absorbing energy from the energy beam, as the island cools down after irradiation is complete it cools from its centre outwards. This leads to reliable single crystal growth extending right out to the edges of the island 4 .
