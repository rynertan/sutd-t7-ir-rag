# Automatic chemical analyzer.

## Abstract
An automatic chemical analyzer suitable for performing a number of chemical analysis operations is disclosed. Samples in sample containers are sequentially dispensed to an array of reaction vessels. Reagent solutions for the analysis operations are delivered to the reaction vessels from reagent containers 31 using an electrically conductive pipetting tube 39 . The reaction solutions in the reaction vessels are monitored by a photometer. To remove the need for visual checking of the amount of the reagents remaining in the containers 31 , when the reagent solutions are sucked into the pipetting tube 39 , the liquid levels of the reagent solutions in the reagent containers are detected by a liquid level sensor formed by the pipetting tube 39 and a conductive electrode 61 . The amount of each reagent solution remaining is determined from the position of the liquid level sensor on reaching the liquid le vel and the number of possible dopes of the reagent solution remaining is displayed on a cathode ray tube.
