# Read and erase device.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a device adapted to read and erase magnetically encoded information on a ticket or card. A compact self contained device is provided for attachment to a local utility meter e.g. electricity meter or a gas meter. The device comprises a compact casing 10 which is attached to an electrical drive motor 11 which, via roller 9, drives a drive roller 13. The casing 10 includes an entry mouth 18 which leads a flow path 19 passing between the drive roller 13 and a pinch roller 15 and terminating in an exit mouth 20. Adjacent the entry mouth 18 are sensors 21, adapted to energise the motor 11 when a card is pushed into the entry mouth 18. Similarly adjacent the exit mouth 20 are sensors incorporating switches 22 which may be used to de energise or reverse the motor. A magnetic read head 25 is located within the casing 10 and is adapted to read information magnetically recorded on the card or ticket as it flows along the flow path 19. An erase head 23 may also be provided.
