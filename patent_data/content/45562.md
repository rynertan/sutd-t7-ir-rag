# FILTER AID AND PIGMENT DISPERSANT

## Abstract
Water soluble cationic polymers of molecular weight 10,000 to 2,500,000 are used as filter aids and pigment dispersants for dewatering pigments such as clay, titanium dioxide and calcium carbonate and redispersing the pigment for processing by the user. They are added to the slurry before dewatering, in an amount of 0.05 to 3.0 kg per dry tonne of pigment.
