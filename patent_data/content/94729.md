# Hand weaving loom.

## Abstract
A hand weaving loom comprising a frame provided with a loom beam and a breast beam between which the warp threads are stretched in operation, the warp threads being guided between the loom beam and the breast beam along guide members which are movable in a direction transverse of the warp threads away from and towards one another with the aid of a driving mechanism to be actuated by hand or foot, whereby said two beams are relatively displaceable in a direction towards and away from one another with the aid of the driving mechanism in a manner such that, when the guide members are moved away from one another, the beams move towards one another, whereas the beams are spaced apart by the maximum distance when the warp threads are located at least substantially in the same plane.
