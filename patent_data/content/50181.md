# Method for purifying polyether polyols.

## Abstract
Crude liquid polyether polyols containing an alkaline catalyst are purified by the steps of neutralizing said crude liquid polyether polyol with a mineral acid having a dissociation constant of greater than 10 Â³ at 25 C, distilling off water from said liquid, and filtering the same. The improvement resides in the step of adding a hydrate of a metal salt of said mineral acid to the liquid polyether polyol at a stage before the distillation step for promoting the crystal growth of a salt formed from said alkaline catalyst by the neutralization.
