# Checking programmed controller operation.

## Abstract
Programmed controllers execute sequences of control functions for controlling a device. External noise can cause controller malfunctions on critically operated devices. Proper sequencing is verified by assigning an access key check code to particular sequences. A check key code is generated during execution of a sequence only if the sequence is proper ly executed by the programmed controller. On completion of the control sequence, the generated code is compared with the access or original code for verifying appropriate pro grammed controller sequencing. Several sequences can be embedded or nested in each other, each having its own check key with the overall sequence also having an independent check key.
