## Description
The present invention relates to a colony stimulating factor hereinafter CSF and, more particularly, to the cloning of the gene for the human granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor hereinafter GM CSF by use of a nucleotide probe derived from a murine GM CSF complementary deoxyribonucleic acid cDNA clone to screen a cDNA library synthesized from messenger ribonucleic acid mRNA containing human GM CSF mRNA, and to the characterization of the GM CSF gene. CSF refers to a family of lymphokines which induce progenitor cells found in the bone marrow to differentiate into specific types of mature blood cells. The particular type of mature blood cell that results from a progenitor cell depends upon the type of CSF present. For instance, erythropoietin is believed to cause progenitor cells to mature into erythrocytes while thrombopoietin is thought to drive progenitor cells along the thrombocytic pathway. Similarly, granulocyte macrophage colony formation is dependent on the presence of GM CSF. The present invention concerns the cloning of human GM CSF. CSF, including human GM CSF, is produced only in minute quantities Although the factors identified by the above researchers have been reported to be CSF, heretofore sufficient quantities of homogeneous human CSF, including GM CSF, have not been available to thoroughly investigate its biochemistry and biology. The availability of adequate quantities of homogeneous human GM CSF would be valuable in investigations and possible treatment of proliferative blood disorders, such as certain leukemias and anemias. Also, human GM CSF in greater purity and larger quantities than heretofore available, could prove useful in achieving successful bone marrow transplantation following cancer chemotherapy. One potential method of providing relatively large quantities of homogeneous human GM CSF is through recombinant DNA techniques. Recombinant DNA techniques have been developed for economically producing a desired protein once the gene coding for the protein has been isolated and identified. A discussion of such recombinant DNA techniques for protein production is set forth in the editorial and supporting papers in Vol. 196 of In accordance with the present invention, the gene coding for human GM CSF is isolated from a cDNA library with a nick translated cDNA probe. The probe is isolated from a murine GM CSF cDNA library by use of a synthetic oligonucleotide probe corresponding to a portion of the nucleotide sequence of murine GM CSF. Total human RNA is extracted from cell lines or other sources thought to produce relatively high levels of GM CSF. Polyadenylated mRNA is isolated from the total RNA extract. A cDNA library is constructed by reversed transcription of the polyadenylated mRNA with reverse transcriptase. The DNA is rendered double stranded with DNA polymerase I and inserted into an appropriate cloning vector. Resultant recombinant cloning vectors are used to transform an appropriate host. Transformed hosts are identified and grouped into pools. Plasmid DNA prepared from these pools is hybridized with the murine cDNA probe that has been radiolabeled. The pool s of clones that give a positive signal to the probe is identified and then the putative pool subdivided and the hybridization screen repeated. A single transformant corresponding to the human GM CSF gene is eventually identified. Plasmid DNA is prepared from this transformant and characterized by DNA sequencing. In addition, the corresponding amino acid sequence is determined from the nucleotide sequence. The coding region of the human GM CSF gene is cloned in a yeast host system to express mature GM CSF. Thereafter biological assays are conducted to confirm that the expressed protein product is GM CSF. The details of typical embodiments of the present invention will be described in connection with the accompanying drawings, in which Preferably, a cDNA library, from which the gene coding for human GM CSF will be sought, is constructed from cells previously found to produce relatively high levels of other lymphokines, under the assumption that they might also produce human GM CSF. These sources may include malignant cell lines, such as a human lymphoma T cell line. Applicants have prepared cDNA libraries from several human lymphoma T cell lines, such as HUT 102 and Jurkat. These particular cell lines are available from a wide variety of sources and have been used extensively by researchers. See, for instance, Leonard et al., 80 Activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells also potentially may be a source of GM CSF molecules. For use in the present invention, the peripheral blood mononuclear cells can be separated from whole blood by standard techniques, such as by Ficoll Hypaque centrifugation. Adherent cells are removed by plastic adherence and the remaining leukocytes multiplied by culturing Applicants have investigated a number of human cell lines, including those noted above, and peripheral blood T cells as sources for the gene coding for human GM CSF. As set forth Total RNA from human potentially GM CSF producing cells is extracted by standard methods, such as disclosed by Chirgwin et al., 18 As is well known, when extracting RNA from cells, it is important to minimize ribonuclease RNase activity during the initial stages of extraction. One manner in which this is accomplished is to denature the cellular protein, including the RNase, at a rate that exceeds the rate of RNA hydrolysis by RNase. In the procedures of Chirgwin et al., Next, polyadenylated mRNA is separated from the extracted protein. Although several techniques have been developed to carry out this separation process, one preferred method is to chromatograph the polyadenylated mRNA on oligo dT cellulose as described by Edmonds et al., 68 A library of double stranded cDNA corresponding to the total mRNA, as prepared above, is constructed by known techniques employing the enzyme reverse transcriptase. One such procedure which may be employed in conjunction with the present invention is detailed by Maniatis et al., It is to be understood that in accordance with the present invention, alternative standard procedures may be employed to prepare double stranded cDNA from mRNA. One such alternative technique is disclosed by Land et al., 9 Next, the double stranded cDNA is inserted within a cloning vector which is used to transform compatible prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cells for replication of the vector. Thereafter, the transformants are identified and plasmid DNA prepared therefrom. To carry out the present invention, various cloning vectors may be utilized. Although the preference is for a plasmid, the vector may be a bacteriophage or a cosmid. If cloning occurs in mammalian cells, viruses also can be used as vectors. If a plasmid is employed, it may be obtained from a natural source or artificially synthesized. The particular plasmid chosen should be compatible with the contemplated transformation host, whether a bacteria such as Escherichia coli If If a bacteriophage is used instead of a plasmid, such phages should have substantially the same characteristics noted above for selection of plasmids. This includes the existence of a phenotypic marker and ligatable termini for attachment of foreign genes. Preferably, in the present invention, the double stranded cDNA, having blunt ends, is inserted into a plasmid vector by homopolymeric tailing. As is well known in the art, in this technique, complementary homopolymer tracks are added to the strands of the cDNA and to the plasmid DNA. The vector and double stranded cDNA are then joined together by hydrogen bonding between complementary homopolymeric tails to form open, circular hybrid molecules capable of transforming host cells, such as In one procedure for homopolymeric tailing, approximately 50 to 150 dA nucleotide residues are added to the 3 ends of linearized plasmid DNA. A similar number of dT nucleotide residues are added to the 3 ends of the double stranded cDNA and then the cDNA and plasmid joined together. In an alternative and preferred method, dG tails are added to the 3 ends of the cloning vector that has been cleaved with an appropriate restriction enzyme. For instance, if the pBR322 plasmid is employed, the restriction enzyme Pst I may be used to digest the plasmid at the ampicillin resistant gene. Complementary dC tails are added to the 3 ends of the double stranded cDNA prior to insertion of the cDNA segment in the plasmid with on appropriate annealing buffer. It is to be understood that the double stranded cDNA may be inserted within plasmid cloning vectors by other various standard methods. One such alternative technique involves attaching synthesized nucleotide linkers to the ends of the cDNA strands by using DNA ligase. The linkers are cleaved with a restriction enzyme to generate cohesive termini for insertion within a plasmid cleaved with the same restriction enzyme. Scheller et al., 196 The recombinant DNA plasmids, as prepared above, are used to transform host cells. Although the host may be any appropriate prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell, it is preferably a well defined bacteria, such as If In transformation protocols, including those disclosed by Maniatis et al., A radiolabeled DNA fragment composed of several hundred base pairs bp corresponding to a majority of the nucleotide sequence of the gene coding for the murine GM CSF species is used as a probe to screen the above prepared human cDNA library. The probe is isolated from a murine cDNA library with a radiolabeled, synthetic oligonucleotide probe corresponding to a portion of the nucleotide sequence of murine GM CSF. To isolate the cDNA probe for use in the screening procedure of the present invention, a murine cDNA library is initially prepared from murine mRNA using the procedures set forth above. The mRNA is extracted from a murine cell line known to produce GM CSF species. Such cell lines may include various T and macrophage cell lines, such as the T lymphoma cell line LBRM 33 or clones thereof which are radiation induced splenic lymphoma cell lines from the B 10.BR mouse. This cell line and clones thereof are available from a wide variety of commercial and private sources and has been extensively used by U.S. and foreign researchers. Total RNA from the murine cells is extracted by standard methods as discussed above, for instance, by the use of guanidinium thiocyanate together with 2 mercaptoethanol. Thereafter, polyadenylated mRNA is separated from the extracted protein by chromatography on oligo dT cellulose. A library of double stranded cDNA corresponding to the murine mRNA is constructed, as discussed above, by employing reverse transcriptase to form an initial cDNA strand by using the mRNA as a template. Next, the enzyme DNA polymerase I is used to synthesize the second cDNA strand, employing the first strand as a template. The double stranded cDNA is inserted within a cloning vector which is used to transform compatible host cells for replication of the vector. Preferably, the vector is composed of a plasmid having a number of unique restriction sites, such as the plasmid pBR322. The cDNA prepared from the mRNA may be inserted within this plasmid by homopolymeric tailing, as described above. The recombinant plasmids are used to transform a compatible host, such as a strain of A radiolabeled oligonucleotide is synthesized for use as a probe to screen the murine cDNA library. The probe, derived of a portion of the antisense strand of the gene coding for murine GM CSF, has the following composition 5 TGATGGCCTCTACATGCTTCCAAGGCCGGGTAACAATTAT 3 . This probe complements the 5 terminal portion of the sense strand shown in FIGURE 1, and has the advantage of being short enough to be relatively easily synthesized, while being long enough to contain sufficient information to be useful as a probe for the murine GM CSF gene. It is to be understood, however, that the composition of the probe may correspond to other portions of the murine GM CSF gene without departing from the scope or spirit of the present invention. The synthetic oligonucleotide probe may be readily chemically synthesized by well known techniques, such as by phosphodiester or triester methods. The details of the triester synthesis technique are set forth, for example, in Sood et al., The murine cDNA library is screened with the synthetic radiolabeled probe as detailed The murine plasmid DNA is sequenced by the chain termination method discussed Initially the entire length of the isolated murine plasmid DNA was chosen as a probe for screening the human cDNA library prepared above. A relatively large size probe in the range of 300 500 bp usually increases the likelihood that cDNA, actually coding for human GM CSF would be hybridized rather than non GM CSF coding cDNA fragments. However, use of this entire murine plasmid DNA insert as a probe was not successful no hybridization occurred with cDNA fragments of the human library. Subsequently, the size of the murine probe was reduced and the human cDNA library rescreened. The smaller probe consisted of a fragment extending from nucleotide Nos. 45 to 400 as indicated by the solid underline in FIGURE 1, and thus included only a small portion of the 3 non coding region and none of the 5 non coding region of the mouse plasmid DNA fragment. As detailed below, use of this probe was successful in isolating the human GM CSF gene from a cDNA library. It is to be understood that probes corresponding to other portions of the nucleotide sequence of the murine plasmid DNA fragment may be employed without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The murine cDNA probe is radiolabeled prior to being used for hybridizing to the human cDNA library pools. Due to the relatively large size of the probe, various labeling techniques may be employed however, preferably the probe is labeled by nick translation. In this well known technique, as discussed by Rigby et al., 113 In the screening procedure of the present invention, the transformants are initially pooled into relatively large groups each composed of approximately 100,000 transformants. The replicated plasmids are extracted from the transformants using any one of several well known techniques, such as by alkaline lysis. Plasmid DNA is prepared by cleaving the extracted plasmids with Pst I. The resulting DNA segments are fractionated by electrophoresis on agarose gels and then directly analyzed by Southern blotting as described by Southern, 98 The putative pool s of clones that discloses a strongly hybridizing band during autoradiography is subdivided into groups of approximately 5,000 transformants, and then the above described hybridizing screen using the labeled murine cDNA probe is repeated. This process of subdividing putative pools of clones and screening transformants is repeated until a desired pool size is obtained. A single transformant that hybridizes to the labeled probe is then identified by the well known colony hybridizing technique of Grunstein and Hogness, 72 The plasmid DNA prepared above is sequenced using standard chain termination methods. This technique of nucleotide sequencing was originated by Sanger et al., 70 FIGURE 2 illustrates the nucleotide sequence of the human GM CSF gene contained in the pHG23 plasmid DNA prepared above. The corresponding amino acid composition of the coding region of the gene is also illustrated in FIGURE 2, beginning from the Ala residue, No. 1 nueleotide No. 14 and extending to the Glu residue, No. 127 nucleotide No. 394 . In preparation for the sequencing procedures, the plasmid DNA containing the DNA insert is subcloned into M13 phage vectors to form single stranded DNA templates. A universal primer is used to sequence the sense and antisense strands. Rather than relying on the sequencing results obtained from sequencing the entire length of the fragments with a single chain termination procedure, an additional synthetically produced primer is used to initiate the chain termination procedure from an intermediate location along the length of the subcloned DNA fragment. The composition of the synthetically produced primer was based on the sequence information obtained using the universal primer. By this process, both strands of the subcloned DNA fragment are sequenced in overlapping fashion, thereby serving to redundantly confirm the sequences. It is to be understood that rather than employing the chain termination technique outlined above, other known methods may be utilized to sequence cloned human cDNA inserts without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. For instance, the chemical degradation method of Maxam and Gilbert as set forth in 74 To determine whether the cDNA coding region of the GM CSF gene as contained in pHG23 would encode functional GM CSF, the gene is expressed in host cells and then tested for its ability to stimulate the growth of bone marrow colonies in agar. A cDNA fragment of substantially the entire coding region of the GM CSF gene shown in FIGURE 2, from the Sfa NI to Nco I fragment, is inserted into an expression vector, FIGURE 3, designed to direct synthesis and secretion of the mature form of GM CSF from yeast host cells. The expression vector, designated as pY α fGM 2, contains sequences derived from plasmid pBR 322 thick line containing an origin of replication and the ampicillin resistance gene Ap The pY α fGM 2 expression plasmid is transformed into an appropriate strain of Since the availability of cells that synthesize GM CSF is limited, the expression of GM CSF mRNA from a number of cell types which have been reported previously to express other CSF was investigated. Northern blots of RNA from these cells were analyzed by hybridization with an RNA probe derived from pHG23. As shown in FIGURE 4, the probe is strongly hybridized to single bands of RNA derived from peripheral blood T cells activated with PMA and Con A and from HUT 102 cells lanes 3 and 1 . A low level of hybridization occurred in RNA from a human bladder tumor cell line lane 6 . Also, no hybridization occurred in RNA from unstimulated T cells, lipopolysaccharide stimulated macrophages and a human pancreatic tumor cell line lane 2, 4 and 5 . These results are consistant with the level of biological activity found to be associated with GM CSF derived from activated peripheral blood T cells and from HUT 102 cells. The number of GM CSF related genes in human genomic DNA was investigated by hybridizing a ³²P labeled human GM CSF probe to Southern blots of human genomic DNA fragments. The fragments were prepared by digesting human genomic DNA with a number of different restriction enzymes expected to cut the DNA relatively infrequently. As shown in FIGURE 5, digestion of the human genomic DNA with Hind III, Eco RI, or Pst I resulted in single bands, whereas digestion with Bgl II resulted in two hybridization bands. Based on these results, it appears that GM CSF exists as a single copy gene in human genomic DNA. The processes and products of the present invention are further illustrated by the following examples. HUT 102 cells at a concentration of approximately 2 x 10⁶ cells per ml were cultured in 100 500 ml volumes in Roswell Park Memorial Institute RP MI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 v v fetal calf serum FCS , 2 mM glutamine, 100 U ml penicillin and 100 micrograms per milliliter ug ml streptomycin. The cells were cultured for approximately 3 5 days in a humidified atmosphere of 5 CO₂ in air. After this period of time, viable cells were harvested by centrifugation. Total RNA was extracted from the HUT 102 cells by the standard method described by Chirgwin et al., Thereafter, polyadenylated mRNA was separated from the extracted protein on an oligo dT cellulose chromatography column using the standard method disclosed by Maniatis et al., Peripheral blood T lymphocyte cells mixture from Portland, Oregon Red Cross at a concentration of approximately 2 x 10⁶ cells per ml were cultured in 100 500 ml volumes in RP MI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 v v FCS, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U ml penicillin and 100 ug ml streptomycin, together with 20 ug ml concanavalin A Con A Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Piscataway, NJ and 10 ug ml phorbal myristrate acetate PMA Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO . The cells were cultured for approximately 20 hours in a humidified atmosphere of 5 CO₂ in air. After this period of time, viable cells were harvested by centrifugation. Thereafter, total RNA was extracted from the peripheral blood T cells and polyadenylated mRNA prepared from the extracted protein as described in Example 1, A library of double stranded cDNA corresponding to the mRNA was prepared from the purified total mRNA in Examples 1 and 1A by employing the standard procedure detailed by Maniatis et al., The double stranded cDNA was fractionated into size classes by Sephacryl S 400 Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Piscataway, N.J. column chromatography and monitored by analysis using alkaline agarose electrophoresis employing end labeled fragments of pBR322 DNA as molecular weight markers. cDNA having a length of less than 500 bp was discarded to avoid needless cloning of these undersized cDNA fractions. The double stranded cDNA fractions, as prepared above, were inserted into the Pst I site of the pBR322 plasmid by the standard method contained in Maniatis et al., The recombinant plasmids were transformed into Total RNA was extracted from LBRM 33 5A4 cells and polyadenlylated mRNA was separated therefrom on an oligo dT cellulose chromatography column, using the protocols set forth in Examples 1 and 1A. The LBRM 33 5A4 cell line is available from the American Type Culture Collection, 12301 Park Lawn Drive, Rockville, MD 20852, U.S.A., No. ATCC CRL 8080. The integrity of the resulting polyadenylated mRNA was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. A library of double stranded cDNA corresponding to the murine mRNA was prepared by the method set forth above in Example 2. The resulting double stranded cDNA fractions of sizes greater than 500 bp were inserted into the Pst I site of the pBR322 plasmid by the homopolymeric tailing method set forth in Example 2. The recombinant plasmids were transformed into A synthetic oligonucleotide probe was chemically synthesized by standard triester method, as detailed by Sood et al., To facilitate initial screening of the murine cDNA library, the transformed bacterial cultures were grouped into pools, each having approximately 3000 different clones. Plasmid DNA was removed from samples of the host bacteria by standard alkaline lysis method detailed by Ish Horowicz and Burke, 9 Plasmid DNA was prepared from the identified positive colony by the procedures set forth above and then sequenced as discussed in Example 5, The 356 bp fragment of the murine GM CSF cDNA clone defined by the solid underline in FIGURE 1 nucleotide No. 45 to nucleotide No. 400 was selected as a probe for screening the human plasmid DNA prepared in Example 2 above. The probe fragment was removed from the murine cDNA clone by double digestion with the restriction enzymes Pst I and Hae III followed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The cDNA nucleotide probe was radiolabeled by nick translation by the standard procedure set forth in Maniatis et al., To facilitate initial screening of the cDNA library prepared in Example 2 above, the transformed bacteria cultures were grouped into pools each having approximately 100,000 different clones. Plasmid DNA was removed from samples of the host bacteria by standard alkaline lysis method detailed by Ish Horowicz and Burke, 9 The bound DNA was next hybridized with the labeled cDNA probe. Briefly, the baked nitrocellulose was incubated at 55 C for 2 4 hours in prehybridization buffer composed of 6 x SSC, 0.5 NP40 detergent, 0.1 sarcosyl, 5 x Denhardt s solution 0.02 Ficoll, 0.02 polyvinyl pyrrolidone, 0.02 BSA and 100 ug ml denatured salmon sperin DNA Sigma Type III, sodium salt . The filter was then incubated overnight at 55 C with the ³²P labeled cDNA probe 10⁶ cpm ml from Example 3 in hybridizing solution as above. After overnight hybridization, the filter was washed extensively with 6 x SSC at room temperature and then for 1 hour at 42 C and then for 1.5 hours at 55 C with 6 x SSC. After air drying, the filter was subjected to autoradiography at 70 C. From the autoradiography, applicants found a number of strongly hybridizing bands. One putative pool of clones from which the plasmid DNA that produced a strongly hybridizing band was obtained was subdivided into pools of approximately 7,000 transformants and the hybridization screening procedure repeated. The putative subpool from which a strongly hybridizing band of DNA was seen was then plated. The resulting colonies were probed with the radiolabeled cDNA nucleotide probe by the well known methods of Grunstein and Hogness, Plasmid, designated as pHG23, was prepared with cDNA from the identified positive colony by the procedures set forth in Example 4. Samples of the host plasmid transformed into The synthetic universal primer 5 CCCAGTCACGACGTT 3 P L Biochemicals, Milwaukee, WI , was annealed to the single strand DNA templates and used to prime DNA synthesis as described above at page 10. Thereafter, the extension fragments were size separated by gel electrophoresis and auto radiographed from which the nucleotide sequences of the fragments were deduced. An additional primer of the composition 5 GGCTGGCCATCATGGTC 3 was employed to prime synthesis from an intermediate location along the sense strands of the cDNA clones. The composition of the additional primer strand was established by sequencing of the cDNA subclones using the universal primer. By the above walk down method, the strands of the cDNA clones were sequenced in an overlapping, redundant manner thereby confirming their nucleotide sequences. It is to be understood that other synthetic primers could have been employed to initiate chain extensions from other locations along the strands of the cDNA clone, without departing from the scope of the present intention. Deoxyadenosine 5 alpha ³⁵S thio triphosphate hereinafter dATP alpha ³⁵S was used as the radioactive label in the dideoxy sequencing reactions. Also, rather than using the gel set forth at page 36 of the Amersham Handbook, a 6 polyacrylamide gel was employed 6 polyacrylmide gel, 0.4 mm thick, containing 7 M, urea 100 mM Tris borate pH 8.1 , and 2 mM EDTA . As noted above, the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA is illustrated in FIGURE 2. The coding region of the human GM CSF gene extends from nucleotide No. 14 Ala residue to nucleotide No. 394 Glu residue , as shown in FIGURE 2. The corresponding amino acids, as determined by the nucleotide sequence, are set forth below the codons. Substantially the entire coding region and a portion of the 3 flanking region of the GM CSF gene was removed from the cDNA clone of FIGURE 2 and employed to form a recombinant expression plasmid, designated as pY α fGM 2 to direct GM CSF expression in yeast host cells. The pY α fGM 2 expression plasmid is on deposit with the ATCC under Assession No. 53157. As shown in FIGURE 3, pY α fGM 2 includes an origin of replication and an Ap Substantially the entire coding region of the GM CSF gene, from the Sfa NI to the Nco I site, was removed from the pHG23 clones by use of Sfa NI and Nco I restriction enzymes in a standard protocol, for instance as set forth in Maniatis et al., It is to be understood that other standard recombinant DNA techniques could be used to generate the same expression vector, and that the construction detailed above is representative of various strategies that could be used to prepare a GM CSF cDNA fragment for insertion into the pY α fGM 2 expression vector. The pY α fGM 2 was transformed into yeast strain 79 The yeast cells were then concentrated by resuspending in 1 10 vol. of SED 1 M sorbitol, 25 mM EDTA pH 8.0 , and 50 mM dithiothreitol and incubating for 10 minutes at 30 C. The cell buffer mixture was then centrifuged for 5 minutes at 300 x g. The pellet was washed once with 1 10 vol. of 1 M sorbitol and the cells resuspended in 20 milliliters of SCE 1 M sorbitol, 0.1 M sodium citrate pH 5.8 , 0.01 M EDTA . Glusulase, to break down the cell walls, in an amount of 10 ³ vol. was added to the solution and then the solution incubated at 30 C for 30 minutes with occasional gentle shaking. The presence of spheroplasts was assayed by diluting 10 microliters of the yeast cells into a drop of 5 SDS wt. vol. on a microscope slide to observe for ghosts at 400 X phase contrast. The cell mixture was then centrifuged at 300 x g for 3 minutes. The resulting pellet was twice washed with 1 10 vol. of 1 M sorbitol. The pellet was then once washed in CaS 1 M sorbitol, 10 mM CaCl₂ . The yeast spheroplasts were then transformed with the previously prepared plasmid vector in a procedure adapted from Beggs, Prior to plating the protoplast DNA mixture selective plates were preincubated at 37 C. Three ml of melted top agar 45 C , composed of 18.2 ml of sorbitol, 2 gm agar, 0.6 gm Difco yeast nitrogen base without amino acids , 2 gm glucose, 0.1 ml of 1 adenine, 0.4 ml of 1 uracil and amino acids as required, was then added to each aliquot of transformed cells and the tube contents poured on the selective plates. The plates were incubated from 2 to 4 days at 30 C. Colonies which developed in the Trp minus medium contained plasmids that have the Trp 1 gene, i.e., those that are transformed. Prior to biological assay, the transformants were grown in 20 50 ml of rich medium 1 yeast extract, 2 peptone, 2 glucose at 33 C to stationary phase. At the time of harvest, the protase inhibitors phenyl methyl sulfonyl P MSF and Pepstatin A were added to a final concentration of 1 mM and 10 uM, respectively. The cells were then removed by centrifugation at 400 x g and the medium was filtered through a 0.45 u cellulose acetate filter. The presence of human GM CSF harvested from the yeast cultures in Example 6 was confirmed by assaying the ability of the supernatant to stimulate growth of human bone marrow colonies in agar. For use in the assay, human bone marrow from the iliac crest of healthy donors was collected in a heparinized syringe. The marrow was diluted 1 3 with phosphate buffered saline PBS at room temperature and layered onto a solution of 54 percoll Pharmacia Fine Chemicals . After centrifugation at 500 x g at room temperature for 20 minutes, the interface was collected and washed with 20 volumes of PBS. The suspension was then centrifuged at 250 x g for 10 minutes at room temperature. The cells were then resuspended in 10 ml of α Minimal Essential Medium with nucleotides α Mem, Gibco for cell counting and viability determination. FCS was then added and the cell suspension stored on ice until the assay was carried out. In the assay, bone marrow cells as prepared above were added at a final concentration of 1 x 10⁵ ml to an incubation medium consisting of a seven parts of a solution containing 28.1 FCS, 0.7 x 10 ⁴ M 2 Mercaptoethanol, 0.12 mg ml asparagine, 0.7 mg ml glutamine, 150 units of penicillin G, 150 units of streptomycin, 1.1 x α MEM with nucleotides, and 2.2 x vitamins Gibco and, b three parts of 1.4 bacto agar solution Difco . The cultures were incubated in a humidified atmosphere at 37 C in the presence of 5 CO₂. After seven to fourteen days of culture, the number and types of colonies, whether granulocyte, macrophage or mixed granulocyte macrophage, were determined. Applicants found that the GM CSF gene from the pY α fGM 2 clones directed synthesis of GM CSF activity at the high level of 1.25 x 10⁶ colony forming units CFU per milliliter. This activity level was determined by multiplying by 50 the reciprocal of the dilution giving 50 of the maximum colony number. Applicants have found that the average number of colonies from 1 x 10⁵ bone marrow cells was 96 29. The colonies formed at 14 days by the recombinant GM CSF were well defined and consisted of three types approximately 1 3 mixed granulocyte macrophage colonies approximately 1 3 tight granulocyte colonies, and approximately 1 3 dispersed macrophage colonies. As a further control for the expression system of the present invention, a plasmid identical to pY α fGM 2, but lacking the GM CSF sequences, was also transformed into yeast strain 79. The culture supernatant from the yeast produced no GM CSF activity in the bone marrow colony assay. As a positive control, supernatants from human placental cells, a natural source of GM CSF, were also tested for colony forming activity. The human placental cells were cultured at 1.2 x 10⁷ ml for 6 days in the presence of 5 fetal bovine serum. When tested in the bone marrow assay, the supernate from the cultured placenta cells were found to have an activity of approximately 5 x 10² CFU C ml, and to give approximately the same relative levels of each colony type 1 3 mixed granulocyte macrophage colonies, 1 3 tight granulocyte colonies and 1 3 dispersed macrophage colonies. The expression of GM CSF mRNA from a number of cell types, which have been reported previously to express other CSF, was investigated. Northern blots of RNA from these cells were analyzed by hybridization with a probe derived from pHG23. In this regard, total RNA for Northern blots was isolated by the guanidium thiocyanate cesium chloride method as set forth After electrophoresis the formaldehyde denatured RNA was transferred to nitrocellulose filters using a standard protocol as detailed in Maniatis et al., The results of the autoradiography are set forth in FIGURE 4 which shows strong hybridization to a band of approximately 900 nucleotides in 5 ug of total RNA from PMA and Con A activated peripheral blood T cells and from Hut 102 cells lanes 3 and 4 . A low level of hybridization was seen in 1.5 ug of polyadenylated RNA from the human blood carcinoma cell line 5637 lane 6 . No hybridization was seen in 5 ug of total RNA from unstimulated peripheral blood T cells lane 2 , 1.5 ug of polyadenylated RNA from lipopolysaccharide stimulated peripheral blood macrophages lane 4 and 1.5 ug of polyadenylated RNA from human pancreatic carcinoma cell line 1420 lane 5 . The other high molecular weight bands shown in FIGURE 4, 18S and 28S, are due to the hybridization of the probe to ribosomal RNA. The results from the Northern blot analysis are consistent with the high level of biological activity found to be associated with GM CSF derived from activated peripheral blood T cells and HUT 102 cells. To determine the number of GM CSF related genes in human genomic DNA, a labeled GM CSF cDNA probe was hybridized to Southern blots of human DNA digested with restriction enzymes expected to cut relatively infrequently. The probe included the entire pHG23 sequence Figure 2 3 of nucleotide number 161 and was radiolabeled by nick translation by the standard procedure set forth in Maniatis et al., The results of autoradiography are set forth in FIGURE 5. In FIGURE 5 the molecular weight markers in kilobase pairs are from Hind III digested bacteriophage λ DNA. As shown in FIGURE 5, human DNA digested with Hind III, Eco RI, and Pst I lanes 1, 2, 3, respectively resulted in single bands, while digestion with Bgl II gave rise to two bands. On this basis, it appears that GM CSF exists as a single copy gene in human genomic DNA.
