# A device for the separation of airborne particles into grain size classes.

## Abstract
The main characteristic of the present invention lies in the fact that it comprises a first body 12 in which there is formed an L shape channel 18 defined by a first cavity 17 from which, in use, filtered air is ejected into a second cavity 16 thereof formed on the lower surface of the said first body 12 a second body 2 having an upper surface in contact with the lower surface of the said first body 12 a third cavity 3 formed in the said second body 2 in correspondence with the said second cavity 6 and in which there is created a depression a rectangular plate 11 the upper surface of which is flat and the edge of which is fixed by adhesive to the edge of the said third cavity 3 for delimiting the said second cavity 16 from below, there being formed a plurality of through slits 57 in the said plate and a nozzle 41 operable to inject a quantity of aerosol into the said first cavity 17 in proximity with the connection 17 of this with the said second cavity 16 .
