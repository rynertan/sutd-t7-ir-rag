# Magnet developer rolls.

## Abstract
A magnet roll for use in a developer unit of an electrostatic copier having a magnet structure 12 provided by elongated bars 18, 20, 22 of permanent magnet material magnetized to provide radially oriented magnets. The bars 18, 20, 22 are sufficiently rigid to support hubs 26, 28 without the need for a core. A cylindrical shell 10 of conductive material is rotatably mounted on the magnet structure 12 by shafts 54, 58 which are either journaled in or on the hubs 50, 28 of the magnet structure. The bars 18, 20, 22 are made of conductive plastic or ceramic or elastomeric material rubber having permanent magnet material therein which is polarized to provide magnetic poles along the axis 14 of the cylindrical shell 10 which are magnetized in a radial direction with respect to the axis 14 . The elastomeric rubber magnet bars have a rigid steel backing. The entire roll may be fabricated, essentially from plastic material and at low cost.
