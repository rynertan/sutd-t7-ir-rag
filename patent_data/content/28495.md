# Composition and process for stabilizing soil.

## Abstract
An easily pumpable liquid alkali metal silicate composition, having controlled gelling characteristics and comprising water, an alkali metal silicate and glyoxal, also contains hydrogen peroxide in an amount of 0.02 to 0.7 mole per mole of glyoxal, i.e. an amount in the range from 0.025 to 0.18 mole of hydrogen peroxide per litre of composition. The composition also optionally contains a Group I III metal salt, e.g., calcium chloride which considerably reduces the setting time of the composition.
