# Fluid flow control process and apparatus.

## Abstract
Fluid is dispensed from a container 3 , through a delivery tube 5 , under the control of a flow controller or peristaltic pump 7 and, particularly, with the control of the rate of fluid delivery to a patient by an intravenous infusion system utilizing a standard administration set 4 . The control apparatus continually monitors the weight loss of the fluid container 3 , as fluid is dispensed, and produces data identifying the actual fluid delivery rate. It compares this data with a signal identifying the selected delivery rate and provides for adjustment of the flow controller or pump 7 so as to conform the actual delivery rate to the selected rate. Because weight signals for computing the actual delivery rate are not immediately available upon initiation of a dispensing operation, the selected rate signal is initially processed by the apparatus to produce data for setting the flow controller or pump speed to a value nominally corres ponding to the selected delivery rate so that the the actual delivery rate is controlled as accurately as possible from the start of the dispensing operation.
