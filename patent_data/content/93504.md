# Apparatus for introducing silicon wafers in magazines into a furnace.

## Abstract
This invention relates to apparatus for introducing silicon wafers D in magazines 4 into a process tube 8 of a furnace or diffusion oven. At least two spaced silica tubes 1, 2 closed at the end next adjacent the process tube constitute supporting members for the loaded magazines and a clamping device 9 holds and supports said members cantilever fashion by that end thereof remote from the process tube. Motor means are associated with the clamping device 9 for moving the supporting members 1, 2 with the loaded magazinas 4 thereon into and out of the process tube 8 in a substantially horizontal direction in such a manner that the magazines and their supporting members remain entirely suspended throughout the loading, proces sing and unloading operations thus no part thereof comes into contact with the interior wall of the process tube. The silica tubes 1, 2 preferably constitute a sheathing 14 surrounding inserts 15, 36 in two or more sections fitting one within the other the insert 36 nearest the furnace is preferably silicon carbide and the insert 15 remote from the furnace is preferably sintered alumina.
