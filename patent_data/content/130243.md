## Description
CIEAEtING APPARATUS FOR A LEVELLING WINDOW. A KNIFE EDGE AND T E VICINITY TEDUREOw OF A LEVELLER DOOR ON A COKE OVEN DOOR.The present invention relates to a cleaning apparatus for a levelling window, a knife edge and the vicinity thereof of a levelling door on a coke oven door. As well known, a coke oven door is provided on its upper portion with levelling window for levelling the coal charged in the coke oven chamber, and a levelling door having a knife edge is swingably mounted thereon to open and close the levelling window. However, if the levelling door is not satisfactorily closed, or the knife edge thereof does not tightly contact the front surface of the levelling window due to carbon and the like stuck on the levelling window, the knife edge and the vicinity thereof, there occurs gas leakage from the inside of the coke oven chamber.The object of the present invention is to provide a cleaning apparatus, for cleaning a levelling window, a knife edge and the vicinity thereof of a levelling door on a coke oven door, which is capable of effectively cleaning these parts, by means of a pressurized water injection nozzle, on which the carbon and the like persistently stick.The present invention is characterised in that the cleaning apparatus comprises a horizontal underframe mounted on a pusher which runs along the pusher side of a coke oven, an oblong frame movable laterally along the coke oven, a drive means for moving the oblong frame, mounted on the horizontal underframe, a carriage movable toward and away from the coke oven battery and mounted on the oblong frame, a drive means for moving the carriage, a pressurised water injection device having an injection nozzle on its front end and connected to a pressurised water supply pipe, and a lift means mounted on the carriage for moving. the pressurised water injection device upwst√Öaly and downwardly.Thus, by placing the pressurised water injection nozzle just in front of the levelling window, the knife edge and the vicinity thereof with the drive means operated, the cleaning of these portions can be effectively performed.Due to the above construction, the pressurised water injection nozzle can be positioned just in front of the levelling window, the knife edge and the vicinity thereof of the levelling door that has been swung aside from the front face of the levelling window, since the injection nozzle is mounted on the carriage, the carriage can be moved toward and away fro the coke oven battery, the oblong frame can be moved along the pusher side, and the pressurised water injection device can be moved up and down. By the combination use of these drive means, not only the straight portions but also the corner portions where the front surface and the knife edge and its vicinity respectively have right angles can be followed well, thereby allowing these corner portions to be completely cleaned by the pressurised water injection nozzle.In the drawings Figs. 1 to 3 are respectively side elevation, plan and front elevation of one embodiment of cleaning apparatus in accordance with the invention.Referring now to the drawings, particularly to Figs. 1 and 3, there is illustrated a horizontal underframe 2 mounted on the upper surface of a coke pusher 1, and a horizontal frame 3 is mounted on the horizontal underframe 2. The horizontal frame 3 has, on bot sides, see Fig. 2, angular rails 4, 4 for receiving an oblong frame 6 movable to and fro on wheels 5, 5 . The horizontal frame 3 is provided with a rotary shaft 7 mounted centrally and extending in longitudinal direction thereof. The rotary shaft 7 has a screw tread not shown on its outer surface. A reversible motor 8 is mounted on the front of the horizontal france 3 so as to rotate the rotary shaft 7.A screw engaging member 9 is mounted on the lower surface of a bench. plate 10 of the oblong frame 6 and engages through its tapped hole with the rotary shaft 7 so that the oblong frame 6 may be moved forward when the rotary shaft 7 is rotated, for examrle, clockwise by energisirg the reversible motor 8, while moved backward whet rotated counterclockwise.The oblong frame 6 comprises angular rails 11, 11 on which wheels 12, 12 of a carriage 13 ride. A reversible motor 14, for rotating a rotary shaft 15, is mounted on the oblong frame 6 as shown in Figs. 2, 3.The rotary shaft 15 also has a screw thread not shown on its outer surface. A screw engaging member 16 has a tapped hole which engages the rotary shaft 15 which is coupled to the reversible motor 14. The screwengaging member 16 is arranged such that it causes the carriage 13 to move rightward in Figs. 2, 3 when the rotary shaft 15 is rotated, for example, clockwise while leftward when rotated counterclockwise.A support 17 is mounted upright on the carriage 13, and a fitting plate 18 is fixed at both sides thereof on the upper end of the support 17. A pair of rotary shafts 20, 20 are set between a gear box 19 of the carriage 13 and bearings 21, 21 provided at both sides on the front face of the fitting plate 18. The rotary shafts 2O, 20 are also screw threaded on tor outer faces. Gears 22, 22 are respectively fief on the lower ends of the rotary shafts 20, 2C as shown inFig. 1. There is provided a reversible motor 23 to drive the gears 22, 22 through a drive gear 24 wn cn. is fixed to the drive shaft of the motor 23.A pressurised water supply pipe 25 is correct to a pressurised water inection device 26 which has an injection nozzle 28 on its front end. The infection device 26 is supported on a fitting plate 26 as shown in Fig. 2. The fitting plate 26 is provided with a pair of screw engaging members 27, 27 whose tapped holes respectively engage the rotary shafts 20, 20 so that the injection device 26 may be moved down together with the fitting plate 26 when the rotary shafts 2, 20 are rotated in one direction through the gears 22, 22 and 24 by energising the reversible motor 23, while moved up when rotated In the reverse direction. In operation, whilst the levelling window 31 of the coke oven door 30 fitted on the mouth of the coke oven is opened, the oblong frame 6 is moved forward by energising the reversible motor 8 so that the pressurised water injection nozzle 28 may be positioned just in front of the levelling door frame 31 , Then, while feeding the pressurised water through the supply pipe 25 and injecting from the nozzle 28, the reversible motor 23 for vertical movement and the reversible motor 14 for the lateral movement are respectively energised for ardly or reversely so that the nozzle 2b may be moved over the front cf the levelling door frame 31 to crush and clean off the carbon and the like persistently stuck on the door frame 71 . Then, the nozzle 28 is moved to tte front cf the AevellinsT door 32 which has been opened so tat te ife edge 33 and the vicinity thereof may be cleaned by the pressurised water injected from te nozzle 28 in the same manner as described above.After completion of te cleaning, the oblong frame 6 is moved back to let the nozzle 28 move away from the levelling door 32, thereby allowing the levelling door 32 to be rotated for closing the levelling window 31.Since the front face cf the levelling door frame 31 , the knife edge 33 and vicinity thereof of the levelling door 32 are cleaned completely as above, the levelling door 32 can contact closely the surface of the door frame 31 through te knife edge 33, and there can be prevented an gas leakage therethrou h. Since the pressurised water injection device 26 is supported, in the above embodiment, through the fitting plate 26 by the screw engaging members 27, 27 which are respectively engaged with the rotary shafts 2C, 20 in screw pair relaticn, the injection device 26 can be moved up and down while maintaining always its horizontal condition, and further there can be installed the pressurised water injection nozzle 28 of relatively large size on the front of the injection device 26o Although the above embodiment uses the rotary shafts 7, 15, 20, 20 , which can be rotated normally or reversely by energising the reversible motors 8, 14 and 23 respectively and the screw engaging members 9, 16, 27, 27 which respectively engage these rotary shafts in order to effect all the movements fro the forward and reverse movements of the oblong frame 6 to the vertical movements of the nozzle 28, it is alternatively possible to utilise hydraulic cylInder or gear train mechanisms in place cf these devices.As described above, the present invention provides suc cleaning apparatus that can perform effective cleaning, of the docr frame, the knife ed e and vicinity thereof of the levelling door.
