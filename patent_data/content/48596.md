# Apparatus for removing salts and foreign matter from liquids water .

## Abstract
A system for purifying salty or brackish water which may, also, contain solids and living organisms making the water unpalatable for agriculture or long term animal consumption includes a cyclic mechanism which causes an impure liquid to boil at a predetermined pressure and temperature in a first vertical elongated column 30, 230, 330, 430, 530 , vapor cross over means 40, 240, 340, 440, 540 to a second vertical elongated column 50, 250, 350, 450, 550 , said vapor being condensed at a predetermined pressure and temperature in the second vertical elongated column 50, 250, 350, 450, 550 , means 31, 231, 331 for supplying heat to the first column 30, 230, 330, 430, 530 , heat rejection means 51, 251, 351 for the second column 50, 250, 350, 450, 550 for reliquefying the material. Liquid cycling is provided by pump means 24, 84, 224, 284, 424, 484 forcing liquid in both vertical columns to the top of both vertical columns. Gravity causes the liquid levels to fall in first 30, 230, 330, 430, 530 and second 50, 250, 350, 450, 550 vertical columns, causing vaporization of the liquid in the first column 30, 230, 330, 430, 530 and reliquefying in the second column 50, 250, 350, 450, 550 accomplishing single stage distillation.
