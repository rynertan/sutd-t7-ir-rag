# Deoxynarasin antibiotics, their production and use.

## Abstract
Deoxynarasin antibiotic complex, comprising 20 deoxynarasin and 20 deoxy epi 17 narasin. is produced by submerged aerobic fermentation of Streptomyces aureofa ciens NRRL 11181. 20 Deoxynarasin and 20 deoxy epi 17 narasin are separated and isolated by chromatography. The deoxynarasin complex, 20 deoxynarasin and 20 deoxy epi 17 narasin are antibacterial and anticoccidial agents and also increase feed utilization efficiency in ruminants.
