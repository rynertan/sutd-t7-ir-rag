# Caesium stuffed cordierite ceramics and preparation thereof.

## Abstract
Ceramic bodies wherein the crystal phase consists essen tially of caesium stuffed, hexagonal cordierite are prepared. These ceramic bodies are capable of use temperatures up to 1600 C, exhibit nearly isotropic axial thermal expansions, and consist essentially, expressed in weight percent on the oxide basis, of 11 13 MgO, 34 36 Al₂O₃, 33 42 SiO₂, and 10 22 Cs₂O.
