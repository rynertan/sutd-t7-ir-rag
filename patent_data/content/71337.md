# AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE AND A FLUID FLOW CONTROL DEVICE

## Abstract
An internal combustion engine comprises a flow control device 6 , for controlling the flow of petroleum fuel into the engine, and which comprises regulator elements 18, 19 , the relative positions between which controlling the flow rate, the positions of the regulator elements being controlled by an input element 23 . The device comprises an adjustment means 30 which can be set to a number of different values, which provide for different response rates of the regulator elements 18, 19 to movement of the input element 23 . Liquid fuel is thus injected at a desired rate into a stream of air, utilising a closure member 66 which when the pressure at which fuel is delivered to an outlet nozzle 51 is less than a predetermined value, prevents flow of fuel through the outlet nozzle, and when the pressure at which fuel is delivered the outlet nozzle exceeds said predetermined valued, the closure member moves to open the outlet a distance proportional to the pressure in the outlet nozzle. The engine also comprises a cylinder 110 and a piston 112 slidably mounted in the cylinder. The piston 112 is provided with a cooling passage way 122 which at or adjacent the bottom dead centre position of the piston is aligned with inlet and outlet ports 124, 126 of the cylinder. In the use of the engine, gas, which may be air or a mixture of fuel and air, is caused to flow through the cooling passageway during part at least of the cycle of reciprocation of the piston in the cylinder, to remove heat from the piston 112 .
