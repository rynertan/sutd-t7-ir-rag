# Test device resistant to cross contamination between reactant areas and process for making it.

## Abstract
A test device for detecting the presence of constituents in a liquid test sample, and method for preparing it are disclosed. The device comprises a base support member 1 coated with a hydrophobic barrier layer 2 onto which is affixed a plurality of spaced apart reagents 4 respectively responsive to different constituents of the test sample. The barrier layer 2 comprises finely divided silica particles, to the surface of which are randomly covalently bound groups having the structure O SiRâ‚ƒ wherein the R substituents, same or different, are hydrogen, lower alkyl or aryl.
