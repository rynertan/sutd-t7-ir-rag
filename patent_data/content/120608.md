## Description
TITLE Polymer Bound Ultraviolet Absorbing Stabilizer with Resorcinol Monobenzoate BACKGROUND This invention involves polymer bound ultraviolet absorbing stabilizers, preferably containing resorcinol monobenzoate. More particularly, it involves the use of such stabilizers In coating compositions. Many types of organIc compositions, including coatings, fibers, films, molding and dyes, are sensitive to and degraded by ultraviolet radiation. The usual source of such radiation is sunlight, although fluorescent and arc lamps also proviae more or less. VarIous means are used to minimize the deleterious effects of such degradation. Ultra violet absorbing stabilizers absorb the ultraviolet radiation and cult mately convert it effectively to heat at low enough levels that the heat is much less deleterious tan the radiation. Actually, the heat is not rcrr.ally measured, but determined by eliminating other potential routes for energy dis sipatlon such as fluorescence and irreversible chemical change. Organic fluorescent materials are generally less stable chemically then are ultraviolet stabilizers and are not well suited for outdoor applIcations.Ultraviolet sensitizers also absorb ultravIolet radiation but use it generally to generate free radicals, which can be useful ir init ating cross linking in specifically tailored systems, but which are normally thought of as degradative or deleterious inmost organic compositions. Radical quenchers serve as traps for free radicals generated by ultraviolet degradation in a degradative process and thus tend to slow or stop the propagation of undesired effects. Pmtioxidants retard oxidation of organic compositions and thereby minimize the secondary effects of oxidation by which ultraviolet degradation does much cf its damage. Ultraviolet absorbing stabilizers and sensitizers can both be said to be ultraviolet absorbers, but the former are good for preserving the integrity of an organic composition while the latter promote change through the generation of free radicals which can usefully cause crosslinking while si.e .aneously causing some deleterious polymer degradation.Free radical quenchers and antioxidants operate at a secondary level to minimize damage from free radicals and other effects caused by ultraviolet radiation, heat, ozone or other causes Ultraviolet absorbing stabilIzers are centrally monomeric, although they are sometimes provided as cligomers cr with bound groups which increase the molecular weight.Increased molecular weight and the presence of reactive groups can minimize the problems caused by mobility of the unmodified stabilizer. 2 used in a coating, film or other organic body, an unmodified stabilizer may tend to exude from the body and bloom on the surface or even evaporate at an undesirable rat. The use of dihydroxy benzophenone bound into an acrylic copolymer through glycidyl methacrylate and optionally blended with other polymers as a coating composition is disclosed in U.S.Patents 3,328,491 Fertig, et ai 3,340,231 Fertig, et al 3,341,493 Goldberg, et al all 1967 3,28a,8S0 Tocker 1966 3,365,421 Horton, et al 1968 and 3,445,566 Skoultchi, et al 1969 ,See also Ultraviolet Stabilizing Monomers andPolymers. II. Synthesis and Polymerization ofAcrylate and Methacrylate Derivatives of 2,4Dihydroxybenzophenone , J. Fertig, et al, Journal of Applied Polymer Science 10, 663 672, 1966 . Advantages mentioned include decreased migration of the ultraviolet stabilizer and improved com patability and stability. The dihydroxy benzophenone or a derivative cf it is reacted first with glycidyl methacrylate or a derivative of it, and this reaction product is either homopolymerized or copolymerized with other acrylic monomers. Other polymers taught for blending into the paint include polystyrene, polypropylene, polyvinyl fluoride and chloride, vinyl chloride vinylidene chloride copolymers, polymethyl methacrylate, isoprene, vinyl acetate and cellulosics. Also, U.S. Patent 3,418,397 Tccker 1968 describes the in situ preparation of hydroxy benzophenones Fendant to styrene polymers. U.S.Patent 3,595,602 Oppelt, et al 1971 discloses absorbing stabilizers including hydro xy benzophenones and benzilidene malonate bonded to etherified methylolated melamines. Urethane polymers have been light stabilized by incorporating into the prepolymer solution 4 zz.ino or 4 3 aminopropyl amino 2,2,6,6 tetra methylpiperidine, as disclosed in German Offenlegungsschrift 2,642,374 Pfahler, et al 1979 and 2,642,386 Oertel, et al 1976 , or bis 2,2,6,6 tetramethyl 4 piperidinyl sebacate, as disclosed in German Offenlegungsschrift 2,820,419 Thomas 19783. U.S. Patent 3,445,423 Sunshine et al 1969 utilizes resorcinol monobenzoate bound to a urethane adhesive at a low concentration of 0.1 2 , preferably 0.4 0.88, col. 2, line 20, in automobile windshields. The effectiveness of 2,2,6,6 tetraalkyl piperidines as ultraviolet light stabilizers also is evident in the art as disclosed in GermanOffenlegungsschrift 2,748,362 Oertel, et al 1978 and by r. E. Karrer, Makromol. Chem. 181, 595 633 1980 , where in such disclosures the stabilizer is incorporated into a free radical polymerizable monomer. The stabilizer containing monomer, for example, 2,2,6,6 tetramethyl 4 piperidyl acrylate can be homopolymerized or copolymerized with appropriate fr2e radical copolymerizable monomers to provide polymers having Improved light stability.Similar disclosures of acrylate and methacrylate monomers which contain heterocyclic groups and which are polymerizable to polymers e zzibi.ing light stability are made in patents 4,210,612 1980 and 4,294,949 1981 both to Rarrer. However, such ultraviolet non absorbing s abilizers as piperiaine derivatives, whether polymer bound cr not, generally are highly polar and may fail to give water resistance to coatings.Furthermore, since they act on the indirect effects cf ultraviolet degradation, they can only be effective throughout the bulk thickness of a coating rather than being able to concentrate their effects at the surface as can absorbing stabilizers. Patent 4,308,362 Wiezer, et al 1981 dIscloses copolymers having repeat units of maleic or fumaric acid ester or mice, the ester or amide groups of which include alkylpiperidine moieties.The alkylpiperidine moieties impart light stability to the polymers. The light stabilizing portion of the polymer is characterized by low volatility, good migration stability and good compatibility with the substrate polymer to which the light stability characteristic is to be imparted. Azo and peroxy free radical initiators containing ultraviolet light stabilizing groups and their use in preparing free radical initiated polymers which exhibit ultraviolet light stability are disclosed in patent 3,956,269 Sheppard, et al 1976 . Numerous types of ultravIolet light stabilizIng compounds, incorporated into the free radical initiator, are disclosed, for Example, phenol sallcylates, o hydroxybenzophenones, cyancacrylates, benztriazoles and resorcinol monobenzoate.One problem with incorporating ultraviolet absorbing stabilizers in 2 polymer b bonding them to the polymerIzation initiator such as azo and proxy initiators is that this approach inherently limits the percentage of stabilizers that can be incorporated at usefully high molecular weights. Sheppard, et al do not mention higher levels than 10 by weight of stabilizer in a coating, and they do not use more than 2 mers of stabilizer In a polymer molecular. U.S. Patent 3,429,852 Skoultchi 1969 teaches ethylenically unsat rated benzophenone sensitizer acrylic copolymers which can be used to provide cross linking in paint film. U.S. Patent 2,970,066 Bravura 1961 discloses urethane polymers with ultraviolet stabilizers including dihydroxy benzophenone and aryl homologs of methyl beta resorcylate, including reacting the stabilizer with an isocyanate prepolymer, and perhaps leaving some reactive isocyanate groups in the reacted polymer. U.S. Patent 3,441,545 Blatz, et al i969 discloses reacting ultraviolet stabilizers including dihydroxy benzophenone and stabilizer precursors including resorcinol monobenz3ate with various prepolymers through an acid halide group. While useful for various purposes including some types of coatings, residual halides could cause difficulties in some end uses. U.S. Patents 4,310,650 and 4,362,8 both to Gupta, et al 182 , disclose acrylic benzophenone stabilizer copolymers with residual double bonds, having no crosslinkers and a maximum cf 5 stabilizer, and being copolymerized in a single step. Parts, percentages and proportions herein are by weight except where indicated otherwise. Also, Chang s U.S.Patents 4,208,465 1980 and 4,355,371 1982 teach that 1 20 of ultra violet stabilizers can be usec, based on paint solids, and his uropean ate Publication 29595 1981 teaches glycidyl acrylic polymers with melamine cross linXers and with ultraviolet stabilizers. However, his stabilizers are not polymer bound. U.S. Patent 3,372,835 Chung et al 1983 , a division of U.S. Patent 4,328,346 1982 , copolymerizes UV stabilizers such as resorclnol monobenzoate through silane groups at levels such as 15ss. U.S. Patent 3,652,492 Kamogawa, et al 1972 teaches the production of self crosslinkable monomers and polymers including fluorescent materials and mixed ultraviolet absorbing sensitizers and stabilizers. British Patent Applicaticr. 2,036,033A Favie, et al 1980 discloses the use of epoxy bridges to bind salicvlate ultraviolet absorbing stabilizers to polymers. U.S. Patent 3,849,373 Siegle, et al 1974 discloses bonding ultraviolet absorbers to polymers through acid base salt bonds. The above mentioned patents are inccrporated herein by reference. The usual approach to ultraviolet stabilization is to use strongly absorbent stabilizers in low concentrations such as 0.5 3 of the total position such as hydroxy phenyl benztriazoles includIng Tinuvin 328 sold by CibaGeigy. Higher concentrations have been generally thought to be uneconomical because of the high cost of the stabilizer and unstable because of mobility. However, the present invention involves the discovery that certain types of ultraviolet absorbing stabilizers which need not have outstanding efficiency can be used in relatively high concentrations when chemically attached to a polymeric binder as a substantial part of the composition beIng protected. This permits tlfing a thin paint layer or a thin film which is olive opacue to ultraviolet radiratio but which does effectively transmit visible light.This concept can be used advatageously in many appli cations, such as an outer clear layer of paint over other paint layers, some of which may be pigmented a coating on fibers or fabrics which may contain ultraviolet sensitive dyes or other constituents, coatings or films for glass to minimize ultraviolet penetration through the glass coatings for wood or plastics coatings, films or bulk additives in molding resins used as refractors or housing for fluoroescent or arc lamps such as high pressure mercury arc lamps hair spray to minimize sun bleaching or discoloration of hair colorants, as inU.S. Patent 3,445,566 Skoultchi 1969 coatings for color photographs and other potential applications. The present invention seems particularly useful for a thin unpigmented clear coat to be used as thetop layer of an automobile finnish system which may have one or more pigmented layers over a primer, topped by one or more clear layers to enhance the aesthetics of the car, giving a higher gloss. The present invention can provide an outer clear cm at in an automotive color ccat clea coat finish system that will give strong enough ultraviolet stabilization to localize the degra duct on in the outer regions of the surface. Instead of ntercoat adhesion failure and flaking of of the outer lazes as sometimes occurs with color coat clear coat finishes, this can change the mode of aging to slow, minor chalking of the surface.Gloss can remain high with the refractive indices of the constituents chosen properly, and polishing can repair the effects of this type of aging. SUMRY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a polymer which absorbs ultraviolet radiation and effectively dissipates the resulting energy as heat, said polymer comprising a polymeric moiety reacted with resorcinol monobenzoate or a derivative containing resorcinol monobenzoate, said moiety being bound to the hydroxyl group on the resorcinol monobenzoate through a linking group, wherein the polymer contains, by weight, 12.5 0 resorcinol monobenzoate, the balance being said moiety, said linking group including at least one group selected from the group consisting of ether, carbonate, and urethane groups and ester groups containing at least two carbon atoms, said derivative fitting the structureEMI9.1 wherein R and R are hydrogen or alkyl or alkoxy groups containing 1 14 carbon atoms, and wherein there is at least one unsubstituted position on the a rig ortho to the carbonyl groups. The invent ion also includes coatIng compositions containing an ultraviolet stabilizer polymer which absorbs ultraviolet radiation and effectively dIssipates the resulting energy as heat, but which does not contain effective amounts of ultraviolet sensitzr, said coating composition comprising7 by weight 12.5 50 of a first moietv which absorbs ultraviolet energy, said first moiety being bound to a polymeric second moiety tc produce said ultraviolet stabilizer polymer containing, by first weight, 12.5 80 of said moiety, said coating composition also containing a cross linking species which aids in cure of coatings by cross linking with said stabilizer polymer. Preferred coating compositions contain about 15 508 more preferably about 20 , resorcinol monobenzoatei Such coating compo sitions contain liquid carriers, either aqueous or based on organic solvents, or they can be dry powder coating compositions. The polymer con tains an average of at least about 0.8 mers of resorcinol monobenzoate per molecule, preferably at least about 2.1 or 2.5 mers, more preferably about 7.5 mers.The number average molecular weight of the polymer is in the range of about 1,500 45,000, preferably 3,000 10,000, more preferably 8,000 10,000 for certain systems. olymer bound resorcinol monc benzoate of the invention can be prepared by reacting resorcinol monobenzoate with functional groups on 2 preformed polymer, or by preparing a comonomer such as of resorcinol monobenzoate and a suitable methacrylic monomer and then homopolymerizing o copolymerlzing the comonomer. DETAILED DESCRIPTION Resorcinol monobenzoate can be bonded to a polymer, such as an acrylic polymer containing an epoxy group provided by glycidyl methacrylate, through the hydroxyl group on the resorcinol mcno benzoate. The resulting polymer bound resorcltol monobenzoate, when subjected to ultraviolet radiation, absorbs part of the radiation and undergoes a photorearrangement, reportedly a photo Fries rearrangement, to produce polymer bound dihydroxy benzophenone.The structure of resorcinol monobenzoate isEMI11.1 and the structure of dihyroxy benzophenone isEMI11.2 As is knows, the ultraviolet stabilization effect of dihydroxy benzophenone Involves interaction of the carbonyl between the rings with the hydroxyl group shown at the top of the right hand ring, in the position ortho te the carbonyl.Since the bonding of the resorcincl monobenzoate Is through th hydroxyl group, that group remains bound to the polymer in the dihydroxy benzophenone resulting from the photorearrangement. By the term derivatives containing resorcinol moncbenzoate is meant com pounds cr reaction products in which the resorcinol monobenzoate retains its character and effect in performing its function in the present invention, as defined below. Although such derivatives may be used in the present invention t for maximum cost effectiveness under present circumstances, resorcinol monobenzoate itself is preferred. Derivatives of resorcinol monobenzoate fit the structureEMI12.1 wherein R and R are hydrogen or alkyl or alkoxy groups containing 1 14 carbon atoms. Further,r the disposition of R and RT must be such so as to allow at least one unsubstituted ortho position 2 or 6 on the a ring. Resorcinol monobenzoate bound through its hydroxyl group to lining groups include but are not limited to the following 3 1,2 epoxypropyl resorcinol monobenzoateEMI12.2 3 1 hydroxyethyl resorcinol monobenzoateEMI12.3 3 1 aminoethyl resorcinol monobenzoateEMI13.1 3 trimellitic anhydrido resorcinol monobenzoateEMI13.2 3 vinyl resorcinol monobenzoateEMI13.3 EMI14.1 3 chloroformoyl resorcinol monobenzoateEMI14.2 In making polymers of the invention it has been found that it is sometime better to first prepare a prepolymer, such as of various acrylic monomers including glycidyl methacrylate, and then to react the ultraviolet stabilizer with the prepolymer, rather than to attempt to copolymerize all the monomers including the ultraviolet stabilizer at once. There are two important types of differ ences between lacquers and enamels. Enamels undergo chemical reactions after application, and extraneous additives that might interfere wth such reactions are generally undesirable. Also, the molecular eights of enamels are generally lower than those of lacquers. It can be more difficult to formulate an enamel than a lacquer. Enamel resins may need to be synthesized under conditions that could degrade ultraviolet stabilizers. For instance, low molecular weights are needed for high solids enamels, and relatively high temperature polymerization must be used. Thus, it has been found in connection with this invention that post reacting the stabilizers with 2 prepolymer permits the polymer binding of stabilizers in enamels that would be more difficult if possible with stabilizers pre reacted with the monomers of the enamel before polymerization. Although many types of ultraviolet stabilizers can be used in enamels of the present invention, in luding botk. more and less efficient stabilizers, the foliowing stabilizers are particu larly useful in coatIng compositicns of the invention in addition to dihydroxy benzophenone and resorcinol monobenzoate and its derivatives 2 hydrox, 4 hydroxyethoxy benzophenone R OR 2 hydroxy, 4 aminoethoxy benzcphenone R Nw2 EMI15.1 R OH or phenylsalicylateEMI15.2 4 aminophenyl salicylateEMI16.1 2 2,4 dihydroxhenyl benztriazole EMI16.2 It is thought that some of the reported yellowing of coating compositions stabilized with dihydroxy benzophenone may be due to metal ions or complexina or chelating agents reacting with the stabilizer.However, when resorcinol monobenzoate is used as an absorbing stabilizer precursor such as in a film or dried coating, it does not rearrange to dihydroxy benzophenone until it is irradiated with ultraviolet light It may be postulated that decreased mobility of metal ions or other colar causing species locked in tne matrix of a consolidated film or coating elative to in the liquid state leads to lessened discoloration.It is also possible that the resorcinol monobenzoate commercially available is purer that the available dihydroxy benzophenone. Although some yellowing can result from different mechanIsms including by products of incomplete polymer bindIng cf resorcinol monobenzoate and from by products of photorearrangement of resorcinol monobenzoate to dihydrobenzophenone, more so with more agressive amine cross linkers than with melamine cross linkers, it may be that higher concentrations of stabilizers of the invention can be used compared to upper limits that might have been suggested by the literature. Furthermore, certain curing chemistries such as air oxidation are inhibited by phenols.Large amounts of dihydroxy benzophenone could hurt such curing chemistries. However, if resorcinol monobenzoate is used, there is no such effect if the conversion to dihydroxy benzophenone is not done until after the film or coating is cured. Being more swellable than enamels, lacquers generally can tolerate more cl2sticizer and other additives than enamels. Cross linked enamel films are less s .llab1e and generally cannot tolerate as high levels of additives as can lacquers. Thus, it is less to be expected that enamels could utilize high levels of ultraviolet stabilizers in accordance with the invention than if lacquers were involved. In films, crosslinking can be used in at least two stages first to fcrm the coherent film itself second te change the character of the film in use, such as to harden or shrink the film after it has been wrapped around an object. Other adjuvants may be used in compo sitions of the invention so long as they do not harm the basic and novel caracteristics of the invention Auxiliary ultraviolet active ingredients may be used as is often done in conventional paints, such as hindered emlne light stabilizers orquenchers and phenolic antioxidants. Pigments, especially light transmitting pigments of desirable refractive index, may aid in chalking and polishability. Coating compositions may be formulated with additional resins for desired effects. Polymers for use in the present invention containing glycidyl methacrylate can be prepared by methods reported in tie literature. Such polymers having a number average molecular weight between 1500 and 45,000, preferably 3,000 10,000 for high solids enamels, can then be reacted with ultraviolet stabilizers which contain reactive functionality such as amine, hydroxyl or acid groups. The desired amounts of ultraviolet stabilizers can be Incorporated into the polymer backbone by an amine, ether or ester linkage, depending upon the startling functionality, via the epoxy groups of the glycldyl methacrylate.The amount of ultraviolet stabilizers can be varied depending upon 1 the desired level of ultraviolet fortification, 2 the amoun. of residual epoxy desired for cross inkIng. The amount of ultrav c et stabilizers incorporated can be varied between 12.5 and 50 by weight on total polymer solids, with the desired range being between 20 and 50 . The incorporation reaction occurs at temperatures between 80 and 130 C with the desired range between 100 1100C. Reaction time is from 1 12 hours with the optinitaiti range being 3 8 hours. Generally, incorporation G stabilizers into the polymers will not go to com pletlon and more or less unreacted stabilizer will remain in the composition. Modified acrylic copolymers of the invention optionally can then be crosslinked using conventional corsslinkers such as melamines, isocyanates, phenolics, alkyds or other air dry systems, or preferably various di , tri , tetra and polyfunctional amines, either monomeric or polymeric.Particularly suitable amines include methylene dicylohexyl 4,4 diamine, and other cycloaliphatic or aromatic diamines such as Ancamlne i618 sold byPacific Anchor Inc., 1,5 hexanediamine, hexamethoxy methyl melamine or polyamine resins such as methyl methacrylate lauryl methacrylate methacrylic acid propylene imine in weight ratios such as 40 48 12 4.3 PI stoichiometric with the MAA at 43 solids with 1.39 milli equivalents of amine per gram of solid polymer.Alternatively, crosslinking can be done with isocyanates, either monomeric such as Desmodur N sold by Mobay, or polymeric such as styrene butyl methacrylate iso cyanato ethyl methacrylate N dodecyl mercaptan in weight ratios such as 42.2 10 46 0.08. The molar ratio of crosslinker to acrylic is adjusted to give a stoichiornetry between 1.0 i and 4.0 1 wIth the desired range being between 1.0 i and 3.0 1. Such films will cure at ambient tempera turer or above, depending on the crosslinker system, to give films with high gloss measured on 2 Glossmeter made by Lockwood McLarie or Horsham, PennsybTania, of between 80 and 115 at a 200 angle and a hardness of 4 20 Knoop and good toughness.Lower hardnesses are also desirable and obtained for certain purposes. Further, these coatings show pronounced ultraviolet stability lastirg from greater than 2,000 hours to greater than 19,000 hours in QUV testing with between 70 and 93 gloss retention, depending on the coating system. These coatings can be applied to a variety of substratesIncluding painted surfaces, wood, plastics, glass, metal, and organic films.EXAMPLE I TYPICAL PREPARATIONS An acrylic prepolymer with epoxy groups is produced from the fcllowing ingredients butylacrylate hydroxyethylacrylate glycidyl methacrylate in weight ratios of 49 4 37. The prepolymer is maae by standard vinyl polymerization techniques. Thus, the above monomers are combined with 0.5 7 of a free radical initiator. This mixture is fed into a solvent e.g., 2 heptanone held at a controlled tempera ture to yield the solution polymer. The above prepolymer is then combined and reacted with enough 2,4 dihydroxy benzophenone or resorcinol monobenzoate to y. c a polymer containing 20 50 ultraviolet stabilizer. This reaction can be catalyzed, but the preferred method is uncatalyzed. The reaction is held at a tempera are in the range lQ0 175 C so that excessively long reaction times and deleterious side reactions are avoided. A typical enamel can be made by blending 50 80 parts acrylic ultraviolet stabilizing resins 20 50 parts hexamethoxymethylmelamine 0.1 10 parts p toluenesulfonic acid cao atyst 0 50 parts pigment andfor metallic flake 20 400 parts solvent These enamels are applied in a conventional manner such as air atomized spray and baked for 30 minutes at 1200C to yield a hard glossy finish. More specific preparations are given in the following examples. EXAMPLE 2 ACRYLIC PREPOLYMER To 1237.2 go of refluxing ethyl amyl ketone MAK was added a solution of 834.4 g glycidyl methacrylate, 110G.0 g n butyl acrylate, 300.0 g hydroxyethylacrylate, 125.21 g methyl amyl ketone and Ç2.6 g Lupersol 70 a 758 solution of t butyl peracetate sold by Pennvalt over 225 minutes.

The filtrate was slowly added to twice its volume of vigorously stirred water. An oil separates which on continuing stirring solidified. The solid was filtered and dried, yielding 265 g of 3 methacryloxy phenyl benzoate.EXAMPLE 7 PREPARATION OF ACRYLIC EPOXY PREPOLYMER To a 3 liter 4 neck round bottom flask equipped with a reflux condenser, mechanical stirrer, two addition funnels, temperature probe and nitrogen inlet was added 1200 g of toluene. The solvent was brought to reflux temperature and the monomer and initiator feeds were begun.The monomer feed of methyl methacrylate, 300 g butyl methacrylate, 600 g and glycidvl methacrylate, 600 g, was added over 3 hours while the initiator feed of 7AS0 67,.30 g, an azcbis isobutyronitrile polymerization initiator sold by Du Pont, and toluene, 150 ml, was added over 3.5 hours. After complete addition, the polymer solution was held at reflux temperature for an additional hour and then cooled to room temperature. The final resin solution contained 54 S sold polymer.Gel permeation chromatography showed the resin to have a number average molecular weight of 8800 and a weight average molecular weight Mw of 20,000. EXAMPLE 8 This example is representative of the pcst reaction sequence for the attachment of the ultraviolet stabilizer to the acrylic prepolymer. A 1 liter 4 neck round bottom flask, equipped with a reflux condenser, mechanical stirrer, teperature probe and nitrogen inlet was charged with 300 g of the acrylic polymer described in Example 7, 63 g of resorcinol rncnobenzoate or 2, dihydroxybenzophenone, or half each, 56 ml cf tetrahydrofuran and 0.1 g of Irganox 1010, a hindered phenolic antioxidant sold by Ciba Geigy.The reaction mixture was heated at reflux sr six hours end then cooled te room temperature. The resin which contained 25 of the ultraviolet stabilizer, resorcinol monobenzoate or 2,4 dihydroxy benzophenone, was a clear, slightly yellow resin solution. Acrylic polymers containing higher or lower percentages of ultraviolet stabilizer can be prepared in an analogous manner by adjusting the amount of stabilizer added to the prepolymer.Further, blends of the ultraviolet stabilizers can also be ded In a like manner. For instance for a resin containing 20t of the stabilizer, instead of 63 g of stabilizer, 31.5 g of either or half of each can be used. EXAMPLE 9 300 g of acrylic resin described inExample 7 was added to a 1 liter 4 neck round bottom flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, reflux condenser, temperature probe and nitrogen inlet. The resin was brought to reflux temperature and treated with 100.3 g of either resorcinol monobenzoate or 2,4 dihydroxybenzophenone or a blend of both stabilizers in 50 g of tetrahydro furan. The reaction mixture was heated at reflux temperature for six hours and then cooled. The acrylic polymer which contained 378 of the ultraviolet stabilizer s by weight of polymer solids was a clear, slightly yellow solution.EXAMPLE 10 This example demonstrates the procedure for cross linking and forming clear ilms coatings with the acrylic polymers described in Example 8. The acrylic polymer described in Example 8 can be crosslinked and formed into a clear film or coating by blending 1 1.7 g of Ancamines 1618, a cycloaliphatic amine crosslinking agent sold byPacific Anchor Co., with 15 g of the acrylic polymer described in Example 8. For applicatIon, the above mentioned blend is diluted to the desired viscosity with a solvent mixture of toluene xylene Cellosolve acetate, an ethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate sold by Union Carbide, and 0.1 g of Irganox 1010, a hi dered phenclic antioxidant sold by Ciba Geigy. The finish can then be applied by spray or brush to the desired surface and ailowed to cure at ambient temperature cr sakes at 820C for 30 minutes.Ambient cured systems give solvent resistant films after 3 days and baked systems after cooling to room temperature. Both baked and ambient cured films give outstanding durability as shown by 90 retention of 200 gloss after more than 1700 hours in QUV testing. EXAMPLE 11 This example domonstrates the procedure for cross linking and forming clear films coatings with acrylic polymers described in Example 9. The ultraviolet stabilized acrylic polymer described in Example 9 can be crosslinked and formed ito a clear fIlm coating by blending 4.2 5 g of Desmodur N, a polyfunctional isocyanate crosslinker sold by Mobay, with 10 g of the acrylic polymer described in Example 9. For application, the mixture or the acrylic polymer and the iso cyanate crosslirker is diluted with toluene xylene Cellosolve Acetate sold by Union Carbide 50 40 10 and 18 dibutyltin dilaurate to the desired viscosity and applied by spray or brush to the substrate.The coating can subsequently be baked at 82 C for 30 minute or aliowed to cure at ambient temperature. Ambient cured films become solvent resistant after 5 days while baked systems are resistant after cooling. Both baked and ambient cured fIlms show good durability main taining 90 of their gloss after 100 hours inQUV testing.EXAMPLE 12 The acrylic resin for example 9 can also be crosslinked and formed into clear films or coatings by blending 1 part of the acrylic polymer with 2 pats cf polymeric isocyanate such as methyl methacrylate butyl inethacrylate isocyanatoethyl methacrylate n dodecylmercaptan 42.2 0.8 48 10 having an Mn of 2000 at 54 solids. Application is accomplished in an analogous manner to Example 11.1 dibutyltin dilaurate was added as catalyst. EXAMPLE 13 This example demonstrates the preparation and formation of a clear, ultraviolet absorbing coating which oxidatively cures using linoleic acid esters. 300 g of the prepolymer from Example 7 was charged to a I liter 4 neck round bottom flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, reflux condenser, nitrogen inlet and addition funnel. The resin solution was heated to reflux temperature and 66.5 g of the ultraviolet stabilizer resorcinol morobenzoate or 2,4 dihydroxy benzophenone was added in 50 g of tetrahydrofuran. The reaction was allowed te proceed at reflux for 6 hours. Net, linoeic acid, 50 g, was added dropwise over one hour and upon complete addition the.reaction mixture was aliowed to reflux for an additional hour and cooled. A clear film coating can be formed by diluting the above polymer with an appropriate solvent blend along with 1 cobalt napthenate to induce crosslinking. The resin can then be applied to the substrate by spraying or brushing.
