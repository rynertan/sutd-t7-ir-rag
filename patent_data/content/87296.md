# Apparatus and method for generating high quality pictures under low light conditions.

## Abstract
The effective sensitivity of an image tube is increased by inhibiting the readout scan for a plurality of scan periods within a given repeated cycle and enabling the scan for the remainder of the cycle. The output signal produced during the enabled scan is stored and subsequently used to provide a continuous output video signal.
