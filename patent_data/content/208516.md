# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR DETERMINING SURFACE PROFILES

## Abstract
A system for determining surface profiles of specimens such as semiconductor wafers includes a drive 46 for mount ing the water w for oscillatory movement along a line and an optical imaging system 20, 26, 28 overlying the water for focusing a beam on a small spot on the water and including a photodetector 42 for detecting the reflected spot from the water. The spot is scanned along the line of the water while the focal depth of the imaging system is progressively chan ged and the photodetector and connected digital circuitry generate a plurality of spaced output signals for each scan along the line so that data comprised of a series of spaced signals are provided at a plurality of focus levels extending through the surface profile of the water. Computer means 22 are provided for analyzing the data and providing a graphical output 24a, 24b ot the surface profile.
