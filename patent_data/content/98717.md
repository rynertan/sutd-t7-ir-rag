# Lubricating oil for diesel engines.

## Abstract
A lubricating oil for diesel engines is disclosed. This oil is based on a mixture of lubricating mineral base oil and a highly aromatic light base oil, and is highly effective in reducing the wear of the diesel engine designed to run with heavy fuels having high carbon to hydrogen ratios. The oil is also advan tageous in that it does not clog the lubricant filter.
