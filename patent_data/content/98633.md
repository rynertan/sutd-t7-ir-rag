# Device for and method of X ray image processing.

## Abstract
A device for and a method of X ray image processing in which a constant adjustable signal value is subtracted from a video signal of an X ray image in order to correct the vi deo signal for the effects of inherent scatter. The adjustable signal value depends on the X ray tube voltage, the nature of the object to be examined, the field size etc. so that it is preferably dependent on the X ray ex posure parameters. The video signal is preferably con verted into a logarithmic value by means of a logarithmic table which is dependent on the adjustable signal value or on the actual exposure parameters .
