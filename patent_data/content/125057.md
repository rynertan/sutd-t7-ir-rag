# HYDRAULIC HOSE COUPLING

## Abstract
A permanently attachable coupling 10 for a high pres sure multiple layer wire reinforced hydraulic hose 11 in which the grip on the hose 11 is achieved by the penetration of plural gripping teeth 44 through the cover 22 of the hose 11 directly into engagement with the wire reinforcement 21 . The coupling 10 includes an overlapped 16, 18 shell arrangement in the region of at least one gripping tooth 45 to provide a deeper penetration of that tooth 45 into the rein forcement structure 21 when the shell 16, 18 is crimped into engagement with the hose 11 . The nipple structure of the coupling 10 includes an annular gripping ridge 31 in the region of the overlap 16, 18 which produces a pincer like grip upon the hose 11 .
