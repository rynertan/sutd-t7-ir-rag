# SIGNAL MIXER FOR MICROWAVE RADIO SYSTEMS

## Abstract
A signal mixer for microwave radio systems is proposed, consisting mainly of a single gate field effect tran sistor 2 SG FET provided with a self bias circuit 4 to 10 powered from a local oscillator 3 with which the mixer is connected. The proposed active transistor mixer affords a high con version gain with a low noise figure and a minimal amount of circuitry. The gist of the solution consists in injecting the signal produced by the local oscillator 3 into the drain D of the SG FET transistor 2 . This will eliminate both the supply voltage at said drain and the related noise contribution. At the same time the local oscillator 3 will also supply all the bias voltages needed for the operation of the transis tor 2 .
