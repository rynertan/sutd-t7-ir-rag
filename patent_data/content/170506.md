Verfahren zur Herstellung des Antipoden eines optisch aktiven 4 Hydroxy 2 cyclopentenons der Formel

## Description
The present invention relates to a method for steric inversion of an optically active 4 hydroxy 2 cyclopentenone to its antipode. 4 R hydroxy 2 cyclopentenone is used as an intermediate in the production of prostaglandins having the same configuration see JP A 159777 1982 . Accordingly, if 4 S hydroxy 2 cyclopentenone having the inverse configuration could be converted to the R configuration, the economical value would be much increased. Also 4 S hydroxy 2 cyclopentenone is useful as an intermediate in the production of new prostaglandins. Accordingly, if 4 R hydroxy 2 cyclopentenone could be converted to the S configuration, it would be extremely meaningful in the synthesis of new prostaglandins. Thus, it is highly desirable to be able freely to invert the optical configuration of the hydroxy group at the 4 position of an optically active 4 hydroxy 2 cyclopentenone. JP A 156840 1977 FR A 2355815 describes the inversion of a derivative in accordance with the reaction However, there is no disclosure at all of 4 hydroxy 2 cyclopentenone which is the compound aimed at by the present invention. The compound aimed at by the present invention is quite different from the compound described in the prior art document in structure and application. The compound disclosed in the prior art document is utilized for a pyrethroidal pesticide called allethrolone, while the compound aimed at by the present invention is utilized as a raw material of prostaglandins which are useful for medicines. The present invention provides a method of preparing by inversion the antipode of an optically active 4 hydroxy 2 cyclopentenone of the formula This method of causing the inversion of the optical configuration of the hydroxyl group of 4 hydroxy 2 cyclopentenone can be carried out on an industrial scale and yields product of high optical purity. The hydrolysis of the raw material sulfonic acid ester or a nitric acid ester of the optically active 4 hydroxy 2 cyclopentenone can be effected merely by heating the same in the presence of water. However, the reaction can be carried out using a solvent. When a solvent is used, any may be used without any limitation unless difficulty is caused in the reaction. Suitable solvents include aprotic polar solvents, ethers, ketones, aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons such as, for example, acetone, dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofurane, dioxane, benzene, toluene, methyl isobutyl ketone, dichloromethane, dichloroethane and chlorobenzene. When the solvent is used, though there is no particular limitation on the amount thereof to be used, it is generally 1 20 times the weight of the raw material ester. Though the necessary amount of water to be used for the hydrolysis is at least an equimolar ratio or more based upon the amount of the raw material ester, it is generally 3 molar ratio or more, preferably in a range of 3.5 molar ratio to 50 molar ratio. The hydrolysis is carried out under neutral to acid conditions. Inorganic or organic acids, for instance, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid, acetic acid, methanesulfonic acid, p toluenesulfonic acid are used, when hydrolysis is effected under acid conditions. These acids are usually used in the form of an aqueous solution at the concentration of 0.1 10 . No addition of supplemental acids is necessary during the hydrolysis, since sulfonic acid is by produced as the hydrolysis proceeds and the solution is kept acidic. If desired, water hardly soluble carbonates of alkaline earth metals, such as calcium carbonate, barium carbonate, may be added to the solution. The carbonates fill a role of catching the sulfonic acid by produced. Alternatively, buffer solutions such as boric acid buffer solution, phosphoric acid buffer solution, acetic acid buffer solution, and phthalic acid HCl buffer solution may be added in order to keep the solution neutral to acid. Preference is that the hydrolysis is carried out under neutral or weak acid conditions, in order to keep 4 hydroxy 2 cyclopentenone produced at stable condition. Concentration of acids, when used, should be as small as possible. Most preference is the presence of alkaline earth metal carbonates or buffer solution, in order to effect the hydrolysis under neutral conditions. The reaction temperature in the hydrolysis reaction is 20 100 C, preferably 40 90 C when a sulfonic acid ester is used as the raw material. There is no particular limitation on the reaction time. On the other hand, when a nitric acid ester is used as the raw material, the reaction temperature is 20 150 C, preferably 40 120 C. There is no particular limitation on the reaction time. Thus, the optical inversion of 4 hydroxy 2 cyclopentenone is effected to obtain an optically active 4 hydroxy 2 cyclopentenone having a configuration as an antipode of the optically active 4 hydroxy 2 cyclopentenone used as the starting raw material in a high yield and a high optical purity. The isolation of the optically active 4 hydroxy 2 cyclopentenone from the reaction liquid can be easily carried out by usual separation means such as, for instance, extraction, concentration, distillation and chromatography. A sulfonic acid ester of cyclopentenone represented by the general formula RSOâ‚‚X The 4 hydroxy 2 cyclopentenone used as the raw material in the present invention is an optically active substance in a form of 4 R isomer or 4 R isomer. As the sulfonyl halide which is another raw material, there can be illustrated, for example, alkylsulfonyl halides such as methanesulfonyl chloride, ethanesulfonyl chloride, propanesulfonyl chloride and butanesulfonyl chloride or bromides wherein chlorine in the above compounds is substituted with bromine phenylsulfonyl halides which may be substituted with alkyl, alkoxyl or halogen such as p toluenesulfonyl chloride, o toluenesulfonyl chloride, benzenesulfonyl chloride, p chlorobenzenesulfonyl chloride and p methoxybenzenesulfonyl chloride or bromides wherein chlorine in the above compounds is substituted with bromine or trifluoromethanesulfonyl chloride. The reaction of 4 hydroxy 2 cyclopentenone and sulfonyl halide is usually conducted by condensation in a solvent in the presence of a base. When a solvent is used in this reaction, there can be illustrated as the solvent those inactive to the reaction such as aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons, ether and halogenated hydrocarbons, for example, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, ethyl ether, acetone, methyl isobutyl ketone, dichloromethane, benzene, toluene, chloroform, chlorobenzene, dimethyl formamide and ethyl acetate or mixture thereof as to the amount thereof to be used, there is no particular limitation. The necessary amount of sulfonyl halide to be used in this reaction is 1 equivalent or more per 1 equivalent of 4 hydroxy 2 cyclopentenone usually it is used in a range of 1 3 equivalents. As bases, there can be illustrated, for example, organic or inorganic basic materials such as triethylamine, pyridine, picoline, tri n butylamine, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium hydrogencarbonate and potassium hydrogencarbonate as to the amount thereof to be used, there is no particular limitation however, usually it is 1 5 times in equivalent ratio based upon the amount of the raw material 4 hydroxy 2 cyclopentenone. The reaction temperature is usually in a range of 30 80 C, preferably 20 60 C. There is no particular limitation on the reaction time. After completion of the reaction, the sulfonic acid ester of cyclopentenone obtained can be isolated from the reaction mixture at a high yield by an operation such as extraction, concentration or chromatography. However, the product can be used in the form of the reaction mixture as it is in the following hydrolysis and inversion processes without particularly isolating the sulfonic acid ester. An optically active nitric acid ester of 4 hydroxy 2 cyclopentenone represented by the following formula The 4 hydroxy 2 cyclopentenone used as the raw material in the present invention is an optically active substance in a form of 4 R isomer or 4 S isomer. The reaction of 4 hydroxy 2 cyclopentenone and nitric acid is usually conducted by dehydration condensation in the presence of a solvent. When a solvent is used in this reaction, there can be illustrated as solvent inactive to the reaction such as aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons, ether and halogenated hydrocarbons or the mixture thereof, for example, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, acetone, ethyl ether, toluene, chloroform and dimethylformamide. The amount thereof to be used is not critical. The necessary amount of nitric acid to be used in the reaction is 1 equivalent or more per 1 equivalent of 4 hydroxy 2 cyclopentenone, preferably in a range of 1.2 3 equivalents. Of course more amount can be used. As nitric acid, also fuming nitric acid may be used not to speak of normal concentrated nitric acid. Since this reaction is dehydration condensation, as the nitric acid to be used, one having a higher concentration is preferable usually one having a concentration of 60 wt. or higher is used. The use of a dehydrating agent is effective in this reaction. For instance, acetic anhydride or propionic anhydride may be used as a solvent as well as a dehydrating agent. It may be used together with any solvent. When such a dehydrating agent is used, it is preferable that the amount thereof to be used is 1 equivalent or more based upon the amount of 4 hydroxy 2 cyclopentenone or equimolar ratio or more based upon the water content of the nitric acid to be used. Also it is possible to use nitric acid having a high concentration without using the dehydrating agent. The reaction temperature is usually in a range of 40 50 C, preferably 30 35 C. There is no particular limitation on the reaction time. After completion of the reaction, the nitric acid ester of 4 hydroxy 2 cyclopentenone obtained can be isolated from the reaction mixture by a usual operation such as extraction, concentration or chromatography. However, the nitric acid ester can be used in the form of concentrated residue as it is in the following hydrolysis and inversion processes without particularly purifying the same.
