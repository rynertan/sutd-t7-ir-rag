## Description
IMPROVEMENTS IN CONTROL VALVE ASSEMBLIES FOR HYDRAULIC BRAKING SYSTEMS This invention relates to improvements in control valve assemblies for vehicle hydraulic braking systems of the kind commonly on agricultural tractors and like vehicles in which separate first and second brakeapplying valves are operable independently or simultaneously by independently operable pedals to cause hydraulic fluid under pressure to be supplied to one or both of a pair of outlets for connection to brakes on wheels on opposite sides of a vehicle. The brake applying valves may be housed in a common housing and can be operated simultaneously for retarding the vehicle or separately for steering. Known control valve assemblies of the kind set forth are usually operated by a yoke comprising a onepiece member which is pivotally connected at substantially the mid point in its length to a valve operating mechanism for controlling the hydraulic fluid under pressure and, at opposite ends, is coupled to different pedals, the yoke also being provided with spaced abutments for operating the brake applying valves. When both pedals are operated simultaneously the yoke is moved bodily away from the housing to withdraw and operate the valve operating mechanism and allow both brake applying valves to open or remain open so that the hydraulic fluid under pressure is supplied to both outlets.When one pedal is operated on its own, initially the yoke pivots about the pivotal connection with the valve operating mechanism with the abutment for the brake applying valve corresponding to that pedal moving away from the said brake applying valve which can open or remain open and the other abutment closing the other brake applying valve. Further movement of that pedal in the same direction acts through the yoke to close or increase a closing force applied to the said other brake applying valve, and withdraws the valve operating mechanism from the housing so that pressurised fluid is supplied through the open brake applying valve to the brakes on that side of the vehicle. According to our invention in a control valve assembly of the kind set forth each brake applying valve comprises a pedal operated main piston working in a bore, a floating secondary piston working in a portion of the bore in advance of the main piston, a throttle means provided between adjacent ends of the pistons, a brake applying chamber defined by the bore and a reduced diameter portion of the secondary piston for connection to a wheel brake on one side of the vehicle, a pressure space in the bore in advance of the secondary piston, a normally closed inlet valve for controlling communication between the brake applying chamber and the pressure space, a normally open exhaust valve for controlling communication between the pressure space and a return line to a reservoir for hydraulic fluid, and spring means for urging the inlet valve towards a closed position and for urging the exhaust valve towards an open position, the exhaust valve of the first brakeapplying valve comprising a valve member which is normally spaced from a seating surrounding a port connected to the return line to the reservoir to permit communication between the exhaust port and a first inlet port connected to a source of circulating fluid and the pressure space of that brake applying valve with which the inlet port is in open communication at all times, and the exhaust valve of the second brake applying valve comprising a valve member which is normally spaced from a seating surrounding a port connected to the reservoir to permit communication between that port and a second inlet port which is connected to the exhaust port of the first brake applying valve, that valve member being sealingly guided through a wall which seals the pressure space from the second inlet portion the second brakeapplying valve, and a transfer connection being provided between the two pressure spaces. When a brake applying valve is operated the inlet valve opens before the exhaust valve closes and, after closure of the exhaust valve, the throttle means is operative to throttle the circulating fluid and generate a brake applying pressure in the brake applying chamber to apply the brake, the transfer connection serving to equalise the brake applying pressures when both pedals are operated simultaneously, and to transfer circulating fluid from the pressure space of the first brakeapplying valve to the pressure space of the second brake applying valve when the second brake applying valve is operated on its own. Our invention provides an open centre system in which a return connection to the reservoir is throttled to generate pressure in fluid which is otherwise.normally circulated by a pump at low pressure from a reservoir from whence it is returned. By providing exhaust valves of different construction simplifies the valve assembly since only one inlet connection from the pump has to be provided and the transfer connection serves the dual function of equalising the brake applying pressures when both brakeapplying valves are operated simultaneously and enabling the second brake applying valve to be operated on its own. The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a layout of a dual hydraulic braking system and Figure 2.is a view similar to Figure 1 but showing a modification of the brake applying valve. The dual hydraulic braking system illustrated inFigure 1 of the drawings is of the open centre type and comprises a pump 1 which is operating continuously to draw fluid from a reservoir 2 and pump it through a one way valve 3 to a dual control valve assembly 4 from which it is returned to the reservoir 2. A pressure relief valve 5 is connected in parallel with the pump 1. The dual control valve assembly comprises two separate pedal operated brake applying valves 6 and 7.The two valves 6 and 7 are similar in construction so that only the valve 6 will be described in detail with a description of the differences of the valve 7. The valve 6 comprises a housing 8 having a longitudinal bore 9 in which works a pedal operated main piston 10, and a floating hollow secondary piston 11 in advance of the piston 10. A brake applying chamber 12 defined by the bore 9 and a portion of the secondary piston 11 of reduced diameter is connected to a brake on one side of the vehicle through an outlet port 13. A pressure space 14 is defined in the bore between the piston 11 and a union 15 at the adjacent end of the bore 9. A valve stem 16 guided through an apertured guide member 17 extends into the secondary piston 11 and carries an inlet valve head 18 for engagement with a seating 19 comprising a radial shoulder which surrounds that end of the piston bore. Normally the inlet valve head 18 is urged into engagement with the seating 19 to isolate the brake applying chamber 12 from the pressure space 14 by a spring 20 which acts between the head 18 and the piston 10, and an exhaust valve head 21 at the opposite end of the stem 16 is normally held spaced from a seating 22 surrounding an exhaust port 23 by means of a spring 24 which is stronger than the spring 20. A return spring 25 acts on the secondary piston 11 to hold both pistons in a retracted position defined by the engagement of the piston 10 with stop 26 in the housing 8, and the engagement between adjacent ends of the pistons 10, 11 defines a throttle 27 for throttling fluid circulated by the pump, in a manner to be described. The brake applying valve 7 is identical in construction to that of the valve 6 except that in the valve 7 the stem 16 is guided through a seal 28 in a guide member 29 which is itself sealed in the bore 9 by means of a seal 30. In this construction therefore the guide member 29 provides a sealed wall between the pressure space 14 and a chamber 31 which is disposed between the guide member and the union 15. The two brake applying chambers 12 are normally connected to the reservoir through a return line 32, the two pressure spaces are interconnected through a transfer line 33, the delivery side of the pump 1 on the down stream side of the one way valve 3 is connected to an inlet port 34 in the brake applying valve 6, the exhaust port 23 of the valve 6 is connected to the inlet port 34 of the valve 7, and the exhaust port 23 of the valve 7 is connected to the reservoir 2. In the normal brake off inoperative position illustrated in the drawing fluid from the pump at low pressure is circulated in a closed circuit through the inlet port 34 of the valve 6 and the pressure space 14, out through the exhaust port 23, and is returned to the reservoir 2 through the inlet port 34 and the exhaust port 23 of the valve 7. The fluid also enters the pressure space 14 of the valve 7 through the transfer line 33. When the brake applying valve 6 is operated on its own the secondary piston 11 is advanced in the bore 9 in response to movement of the piston 10. Since the spring 24 is stronger than the spring 20, the seating 19 moves away from the head 18 so that fluid from the pump enters the brake applying chamber 12.Subsequently the head 21 engages with the seating 22 to close the exhaust port 23 and the return to the reservoir 2, and the throttle 27 throttles the return to the reservoir 2 through the return line 32 to increase the pressure in the chamber 12 which is supplied to the brake on that side of the vehicle. This pressure is also supplied to the equivalent pressure space 14 of the valve 7 but cannot be supplied to the brake which that valve 7 controls or returned to reservoir due to the engagement of the inlet valve head 18 with the seating 19, and the presence of the sealed guide member 29. When the valve 7 is operated on its own the operation is similar to that of the valve 6 with the inlet valve head 18 being separated from its seating 19 so that pump fluid from the transfer line 33 can enter the brake applying chamber 12 of that valve 7 through the pressure space 14 of that valve. Thereafter the head 21 engages with the seating 22 to close the exhaust port 23 and the throttle 27 throttles the return to the reservoir through the line 32 to increase the pressure which is supplied to the brake on that side of the vehicle. Upon simultaneous operation of both valves 6 and 7, both inlet valve heads 18 separate from their seatings 19 to permit pump fluid to enter both brakeapplying chambers 12. Thereafter the exhaust ports 23 are closed by the heads 21 and, due to the presence of the transfer connection 33, equal pressures are applied to the brake on both sides of the vehicle. In the event of failure of the pump, the brakes can be applied hydrostatically by pressurisation by the main pistons 10 of volumes of fluid trapped in the pressure spaces 14 and the chambers 12 following closure of each or one exhaust port 23. The one way valve 3 prevents fluid being returned to the pump, when the valves 6 and 7 are operated independently or simultaneously. The pedal operated piston 10 may be of greater diameter than the secondary piston 11, and work in a portion of the bore 9 which is of greater diameter.This provides each valve 6 and 7 with a boost ratio in the failed pump case since the increased area of the piston 10 acts to pressurise the fluid. In Figure 2 corresponding reference numerals have been applied to corresponding parts of the construction of Figure 1. The brake applying valve 6 is identical in construction to the corresponding valve of Figure 1 except that the valve stem 16 which carries the inlet and exhaust valve heads 18 and 19 extends through the secondary piston 11 and also carries a throttle head 35 for engagement with adjacent ends 36 and 37 of the pistons 10 and 11, and that the springs 20, 24 and 25 have been replaced by a single spring 38 which acts between the guide member 17 and the inlet valve head 18 to urge the head 18 towards the inlet seating 19 and the exhaust valve head 21 away from the seating 22 The remainder of the system is identical to that ofFigure 1 but it will be appreciated that the construction of the other brake applying valve 7 may be modified substantially as described above with reference to the brake applying valve 6. When the brake applying valve 6 of Figure 2 is operated the end 37 of the main piston 10 engages with the head 35 so that the inlet head 18 moves away from the seating 19 to allow fluid from the pump to enter the brake applying chamber 12. Subsequently, the head 21 engages with the seating 22 to close the exhaust port 23, and the throttle 27 defined by the engagement of the head 35 with the end 36 of the secondary piston 11 throttles the return to the reservoir through the return line 32 to increase the pressure of fluid in the chamber 12 which is supplied to the brake on that side of the vehicle through the outlet port 13. It will be appreciated that by providing the throttle means on the valve stem between adjacent ends of the piston, the number of springs for urging the inlet and exhaust valve heads into closed and open positions is reduced, resulting in a simplified construction of the brake applying valve.
