# Adjustable anchorages.

## Abstract
An adjustable anchorage, for example for the shoulder anchorage of a vehicle seat belt system, can include a channel track 30 in which a slide 10 supporting a seat belt can be manually ratcheted. Tension in the belt enhances engagement of locking pawls in apertures 35. Alternatively, the pawls 120 are permanently engaged in apertures 135 and are freed when the slide 110 is manipulated. In Figures 8 to 11 the slide 40,50 is locked by a pawl 55,85 in response to belt tension and may be held by a lock nut 62 after manual adjustment. A ball catch 59 ensures correct slide positioning in Figures 8 and 9, whilst in Figures 10 and 11 a pawl 89 performs this function. A frusto conical surface 304 on a locking plunger 301 co operates with the walls of a slot 323 to ensure correct positioning of the belt support in Figures 12 to 19. In Figures 20 and 21 the adjustment is achieved by rotating the belt support 424 on a bolt 430 to free the support 424. In Figures 22 to 26 the belt support carriage 510 is freed for movement by rocking about a horizontal axis.

## Description
ADJUSTABLE ANCHORAGESDESCRIPTION This invention relates to adjustable anchorages, for example anchorages which can be used in seat belt systems of vehicles, particularly road vehicles. The invention is concerned particularly but not exclusively with adjustable anchorages for the upper end of the shoulder belt of a motor vehicle seat belt system. The shoulder belt extends in use diagonally downwards from the anchorage across the torso of the user and may have one end secured to the vehicle by way of the anchorage. Alternatively, the belt may extend to the anchorage from a retractor, the anchorage providing a loop or slot through which the belt is guided. Known adjustable shoulder anchorages tend to be inconvenient to use, costly and complicated to manufacture and unreliable in operation. The present invention seeks to overcome these disadvantages. According to the present invention there is provided an anchorage for a belt of a seat belt system, the anchorage comprising a support fe the belt mounted on a carriage for movement relative thereby from a first position in response to a predetermined tension in the belt, a track guiding the carriage for movement therealong, a latch means on the carriage engaging the track in opposition to the movement of the carriage, and means responsive to the movement of the support relative to the carriage to enhance the engagement of the latch means with the track. Preferably the track has latch configurations spaced therealong, the latch means is spring biassed to engage with an adjacent latch configuration, and the latch means and the latch configurations are arranged for ratcheting of the latch means on the latch configurations during the movement of the carriage when the support is in its first position. The invention also provides an upper anchorage for a shoulder belt of a seat belt system, the anchorage comprising a track slidably guiding a carriage for upwards and downwards movement therealong, a support for the shoulder belt slidably guided for upwards and downwards movement on the carriage, latch means mounted on the carriage means and biassed to engage in an adjacent one of a plurality of latch recesses spaced along the track to thereby prevent at least downward movement of the carriage, and co operating means on the support and on the latch means whereby on upward movement of the support on the carriage the latch means is moved to permit at least downward movement of the carriage. The latch means can comprise two arms pivoted on the carriage with the support between the arms, and a pin and slot mechanism can be operative between the support and the carriage to effect inwards pivoting of the arms in rsponse to the manual movement of the support. The invention also provides an adjustable anchorage comprising an element having a slot with at least one narrow portion joining spaced wider portions and a member received in the slot and having a base portion which is wider than the wider slot portions, an intermediate portion receivable in a wider slot portion but not receivable in a narrow slot portion, and an outer portion receivable in a narrow slot portion, the member normally spring biassed so that the intermediate portion is received in a wider slot portion, but being movable against the spring bias to a position in which the outer portion is received in the slot whereby the member is movable along the slot. Preferably the member has a frusto conical portion extending from the outer portion to the intermediate portion and the walls of the slot are advantageously shaped to co operate with the frusto conical portion in such a way that the carriage, when released at a position intermediate adjacent wider slot portions, is urged by the spring bias into a latch position. Further, the invention provides an adjustable anchorage comprising an element having a slot and a member received in the slot, the slot having at least one narrow portion joining wider portions and the member being so shaped that in a first angular position thereof the member and the element are relatively movable in the direction of the slot and in a second angular position the member and the element are restrained against such movement by engagement of the member in a wider portion of the slot. Conveniently, opposite walls of the wider slot portions are respective portions of a cylindrical surface and the member has corresponding opposed partcylindrical portions joined by opposed flat portions spaced by no more than the width of the narrow slot portions. Also according to the present invention there is provided an anchorage for a belt of a seat belt system, the anchorage comprising a carriage means having a support for the belt, a track guiding the carriage for movement therealong, and locking means for locking the carriage against movement along the track, the carriage being rockable against a spring bias from a first position in which the locking means is engaged to lock the carriage against movement along the track to a second position in which the locking means are released to permit the movement of the carriage along the track. Preferably, the locking means comprises a first locking element on the carriage and a series of second locking elements spaced along the track, the carriage means being rockable to withdraw the first locking element from the second locking elements and the support, the first locking element, and the axis about which the carriage is rockable are so located on the carriage that tension in the belt tends to urge the first locking element into locking engagement with an adjacent one of the second locking elements. Embodiments of the invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the drawings, in which Figure 1 is a side view of a belt support assembly forming part of a first vehicle seat belt shoulder anchorage embodying the invention Figure 2 is an exploded perspective view of the assembly of Figure 1 and of a track in which it is received Figure 3 is a part sectional front view with parts removed of the assembly received within the track.

The seat belt 1 shown in Figure 1 extends upwardly from an emergency locking retractor not shown through an elongate metal loop 2, and then diagonally downwards across the torso of the wearer. The loop 2 is held with its plane inclined to the horizontal by means of a metal bracket 4 consisting of a metal plate folded around the upper longer side of the loop and secured thereto, the doubled over portion of the bracket being apertured to receive therethrough a headed bolt 5 with a plain shank portion 6 and a threaded free end 8. The bolt 5 forms a part of the belt support assembly which comprises also a carrier slide 10 having a generally rectangular portion with a central upright elongate slot 11 Figure 2 , and an upper extension portion 12 the free end of which is bent forwardly to receive thereon a knob 14 by which the assembly can be manipulated. A pair of lockbars 15 are pivotally connected to the slide 10, rearwardly of the knob 14, each lockbar comprising a plate with a pin 16 projecting into an aperture in the slide 10 to afford the pivotal connections. Above the pivotal connections, the two lockbars 15 are apertured for connection together by a tension spring 18, and below the pivotal connection, the lockbars widen out towards each other over inclined ramp portions 19. At its lower end, each lockbar 15 has a laterally outwardly extending pawl portion 20. An actuator 22 of stepped circular cross section has small diameter end portion 24 which is centrally tapped to receive the threaded shank 8 of the bolt 5.Theend portion 24 abuts the end of the bolt portion 6 and is received in the elongate slot 11 of the frame 10. An intermediate portion 25 of the actuator, of larger diameter, is received between the upper portions ofthe lockbars 15, and an end portion 26 of larger diameter still, bears against the rear sides of the lockbars to retain them in assembly with the frame 10.One side edge of the slide 10 has a notch and an aperture by means of which a spring 28 is mounted so as to act on the underside of the bolt portion 8, to urge this and the actuator 25 upwardly in the slide 10, so that the portion 25 is above the lockbar ramp portions 19. The belt support assembly is received within an elongate metal track 30 Figures 2 and 3 comprising a rear web 31 and side webs 32 from which front webs 34 extend parallel to the rear web to spaced apart edges.The front webs 34 trap the assembly within the track, and through the slot between them the bolt 3 and the knob 14 outwardly project. Apertures 35 in the side webs 32 are spaced apart along the length of the track and are arranged in transversely opposed pairs. The belt support assembly is received within the track 30, with the lockbar pawl portions 20 normally extending in an opposed pair of the apertures 35 to hold the assembly in position. The actuator 22 is urged by the spring 28 into the upper end of the slot 11, and in this condition, the assembly can be freely ratcheted up or down along the track, the knob 14 being manually grasped to effect the movement. The pawl portions 20 have rounded edges shaped so that they can readily ride out of the side web apertures 35 at the start of this movement against the force of the tension spring 18, which however causes them to enter each opposed pair of the apertures as they come into adjacency with them. The belt support assembly is thus normally held in position in the track 30 in a manner readily permitting movement. However, as soon as a downward force is applied to the bolt 5, as by tension in the belt 1 acting through the elongate loop 2 and bracket 4, the intermediate actuator portion 25 moves downwardly in the frame slot 11, against the spring 28, and in doing so, it acts on the ramp portions 19 of the lockbars 15, to force the pawl portions 20 outwardly into the apertures 35 so that the assembly is very firmly latched against movement in the track. Thobelt support assembly can thus normally be moved fairly freely up and down the track 30, but is immediately and automatically locked in position when tension is applied to the belt 1, as would occur under emergency conditions, when the belt is restraining its wearer against forward movement from his seat. The second embodiment shown in Figures 4 to 7 will now be described. Parts of the second embodiment corresponding to parts of the first embodiment are indicated by eference numerals increased by 100. Figure 4 corresponds closely to Figure.1 and will not be described in detail except to say that the metal bracket 104 of this second embodiment differs from the bracket 4 of Figure 1 in having an outwardly turned extension portion 104 above the bolt 105 and generally parallel with the knob 114. Alternatively, this extension portion 104 could be formed on the bolt 105, on a loop cover, or on any other suitable component in this area. In a manner similar to the first embodiment, the second embodiment includes a pair of lockbars 115 having pins 116 projecting into apertures in the slide 110 to provide the pivotal connections, a tension spring 118, and, on the lockbars 115, inclined ramp portions 119 and pawl portions 120. An actuator 122 of the second embodiment comprises a head portion 126 of generally rectangular shape, an intermediate cylindrical portion 125, and a small diameter end portion 124 which is centrally tapped to receive the threaded shank 108 of the bolt 105. The end portion 124 abuts the end of the bolt portion 106 and is received in the elongate slot 111 of the slide 110. The intermediate portion 125 of the actuator is received between the upper portions of the lockbars 115. Therectangular head portion 126 bears against the rear sides of the lockbars 115 to retain them in assembly with the slide 110. Two slots 200 are provided in the head portion 126 of the actuator 122, one on each side of the intermediate portion 125 and angled as shown in Figure 5. Two pins 202 extend rearwardly one for each lockbar 115. These pins 202 are located respectively one in each of the slots 200. The belt support assembly is received within an elongate metal track 130 comprising a rear web 131, side webs 132 from which front webs 134 extend parallel tothe rear web and terminating in spaced edges. The front webs 134 trap the assembly within the track, and through the slot between them the bolt 105, the loop extension 104 and the knob 114 project outwardly. Apertures 135 in the side webs 132 are spaced along thelength of the track and are arranged in transversely opposed pairs. With this second embodiment the locking members, i.e. the lockbars 115, are always latched except when one is manually adjusting the anchorage. In the normal position, i.e. the resting position, when the seatbelt being worn,the lockbars 115 are latched into the slots 135 in the track, as shown in Figure 7a. In this position the pins 202 on the lockbars 115 are positioned at the top of the two slots 200. It should also be noted that the sides of the head portion 126 of the actuator 122 locate on the inside faces of the side webs 132 of the track 130. This prevents rotation of the actuator 122 relative to the assembly. If one wishes to raise the belt support assembly relative to the track, then an upward movement of the running loop 102 and bracket 104, which are connected to the sliding components, causes the pins 202 to be urged down the slots 200 towards the position shown in Figure 7b. As this happens so the pawl portions 120 of the lockbars 115 are withdrawn from engagement with the slots 135 Figure 7b . This also causes the spring 118 to be tensioned. The disengagement of the pawls 120 from the slots 135 is aided by rounding the top corner of the pawls so that they then roll over the adjacent upper edge of the slot 135. The lower portion of each pawl 120 is formed with a sharply defined edge for definite latching engagement of the pawl in the slot.Once the pawls are disengaged from the slots the belt support assembly can be moved up the track to another setting. In order to adjust the belt support assembly downwards relative to the track, one simply manually pinches together the knob 114 and the extension piece 104 . The action of pinching these components together has the effect of again camming the pins 202 down the slots 200, thus forcing the lockbars 115 out of engage ment. The assembly can then be lowered to the desired new setting. The lockbars 115 are then re engaged due to the action of the tensioned spring 118. Advantageously, the slots 200 extend upwardly beyond the position of pins 202 shown in Figure 7a so that a predetermined tension in the belt can cause downward movement of the belt support assembly relative to the slide 110, so that the lockbars 115 are urged outwardly by action of the portion 125 on the ramp portions 119, and the pawl portions 120 are urged further into the recesses 135. In the third embodiment shown in Figures 8 and 9, the track 40 is channel shaped, the side webs 41 extending from the front centre web 42 towards the door pillar to which the track is secured by one or more inwardly bent extension portions 44 of the centre web, apertured at 45 to receive a bolt or other fastener.The side webs 41 are provided with rows of apertures 46 and one side web has a longitudinal slot 48 parallel to the row of apertures and nearer than the row to the free edge of the web. The carrier slide 50 has the form of a plate, received within the track parallel to and adjacent the front web 42, on which is pivoted, by way of a pin 51, a lever 52 having an apertured end 54 projecting outwardly of the track through the slot 48 and an opposed end 55 formed as a tooth. A spring 56 received around the pivot pin has a respective areas engaging the lever and the slide end urges the lever into the position shown in which the toothed end 55 is spaced away from the apertures in the adjacent side web 41. The apertured end 54 of the lever carries a running loop not shown for the ilt. A cut out towards the lower edge of the slide defines an arm 58 on which is carried a ball catch having a detent element 59 urged by a spring 60 to releasably enter the apertures in the adjacent side web 41. In the normal position shown, the spring 56 holds the toothed end 55 of the lever 52 clear of the side web apertures but a sufficient pull transmitted through the belt to the lever overcomes the spring force so that thezlever is securely locked to the track by engagement of the toothed end into one of the side web apertures. The spring 60 applies force to the detent element 59 to retain the slide 50 in the position along the track to which it has been set. The slide 50 can however be moved manually along the track by means of a portion, conveniently constituted by an extension of thepin 51, projecting outwardly through a longitudinal slot 61 in the front web 42. This portion of the pin 51 can be threaded for reception of a lock nut 62, so that the slide can be releasably retained in the selected position by tightening the nut against the front web.Theball catch serves to locate the slide 50 so that the toothed end 55 is correctly positioned to engage the side web apertures 46. In the fourth embodiment shown in Figures 10 and 11, the track 70 has a front web 71 with a longitudinal slot 72, side webs 74, and rear webs 75 turned towards each other. A platelike carrier slide 76 moves along the track against the rear webs 75 and pivotably carries a lever 77 by means of a pivot pin 78. The lever 77 has a toothed end 79 engageable in spaced side web apertures 80, and an apertured end 81 projecting outwardly of the track 70 through a slot in the other side web 74 to support the seat belt. The pivot pin 78 has a threaded end portion projecting outwardly through the front web slot 72 for reception of a lock nut 82 or other releasable fastener for clamping the slide 76 in a selected position along the track. The lever 77 is normally held in the inoperative position shown by an upper arm portion 84, the free end 85 of which bears against the side web 74 with the row of apertures 80 under the urging of a two armed spring 86 received on theopin 78. The arm portion 84 is cranked so that the free end portion 85 engages the side web alongside the apertures 80. The spring 86 acts with its other arm not on the slide 76 but on a detent lever 88 pivoted on the pin 78 and having a detent end portion 89 received in the apertures 80 to correctly locate the slide 76 for engagement of the toothed end 79 into one of these apertures when a sufficient pull is experienced on the lever .77, typically in the belt direction indicated by the arrow 90. The embodiments of the invention shown in Figures 12 to 17 are particularly suitable for use as an adjustable shoulder anchorage for vehicle seat belts, but the anchorages can also be used, for example, for the adjustment of a normal tunnel mounted buckle which normally remains stationary during adjustment of the associated seat. Additionally, the adjustable anchorages shown in Figures 12 to 17 can also be used for a seat adjusting mechanism. However, in the following description, these anchorages are described in relation to a shoulder anchorage for a vehicle seat belt. The embodiment shown in Figures 12 to 16 will first be described. The main component of the anchorage is a specially shaped latching plunger indicated generally at 301.This latching plunger 301 comprises a relatively large diameter cylindrical portion 302 a smaller diameter cylindrical portion 303 a frusto conical portion 304 a yet smaller diameter cylindrical portion 305, a cylindrical stub portion 306 of yet smaller diameter, andan externally screw threaded boss 307. The largest diameter cylindrical portion 302 thus defines a flat annular face 308. The cylindrical portion 306 of the plunger 301 carries a normal webbing guide loop309 which is attached to an elongate metal loop 310 which is connected to the seat belt not shown itself. A spring 311 is seated between the guide loop 309 and the step between the plunger portions 305 and 306, in order thereby to bias the guide loop 309 forwards against a locknut 312 which is screwed on to the threaded boss 307. The biassing force exerted by the spring 311 prevents excessive end float of the guide loop 309. The rear face of the latching plunger 301 is provided with a cylindrical recess 313 which is arranged to receive, in sliding telescopic manner, a cylindrical rod 314 of a locating member which is indicated generally at 315 and which has a substantially cylindrical head 316 integral with the rod 314. The rod 314 is provided with a cylindrical recess 317, and a spring 318 is fitted within the recesses 313 and 317, seated against the respective ends of the recesses, and biassing the latching plunger 301 and locating member 315 apart. The belt support assembly functions in co operation with a track 319, which may be open ended, or closed at one end as shown in Figure 16, comprises a rear web 320, side webs 321, and front webs 322 which extend parallel tithe rear web and which define spaced edges, as shown most clearly in Figures 14 and 16. These spaced edges have a generally scallopped shape so that the gap 323 between the edges is of varying width along the length of the elongate metal track. This gap 323 has a minimum width, as indicated by the dimension A in Figures 14 and 16, and a maximum width, indicated by the dimensionB in Figures 14 and 16. The maximum gap width B corresponds to the diameter of cylindrical portion 303 of the latching plunger 301. The minimum gap width A corresponds to the diameter of cylindrical portion 305 of the latching plunger 301. Thelocating member 315 is made of a suitable lowfriction material so that the outer face of the head 316 can slide on the inside face of the rear web 320 of the track 319. The latching plunger 301 is made of a suitably strong material to be able to withstand normal seatbelt loadings. During normal belt wearing the various components of the adjustable anchorage are positioned as shown in Figure 13 and in the upper portion of Figure 16. In this position the latching plunger 301 is engaged, its annular face 318 bears against the inside face of the inturned front webs 322 of the track, and the plunger projects to its maximum extent from the elongate slot or gap 323 in the track.In order to be able to adjust the position of the belt support assembly relative to the track, either upwards or downwards, it is simply necessary to depress the locating plunger 301 against the force of the compression spring 318. This causes the cylindrical portion 305 of the plunger to become aligned with the gap 323 in the track, as shown most clearly in Figure 16, whereupon the locating plunger can be moved up or down the track with a sliding movement. When the correct position has been reached the plunger 301 is released and is immediately biassed outwardly by the compression spring 318 so that it resumes a latched position in relation to thetrack.The system is self levelling due to the action of the compression spring 318 which provides an outward bias for the plunger, and due to the tapering surface of the frusto conical portion 314 of the plunger which makes it impossible for the plunger to adopt any latched positioned other than that shown in Figure 16 where it occupies a portion of the gap 323 which is of maximum transverse dimension. Figure 15 shows one method whereby the anchorage can be mounted on a car body, for example on a door pillar.As shown in Figure 15 the upper portion of the track 319 is provided with a rearwardly extending bracket portion 324 through which a fastening bolt 325 is fitted. The bottom end of the track 319 is provided with a downwardly and rearwardly extending tang 326 which fits into a suitable hole or slot in the door pillar 327. Figure 17 shows the sixth embodiment which is a modified version of the adjustable anchorage of Figures 12 to 16. This embodiment is particularly suited to an original equipment fitment. In this modified version a helical spring 328 is positioned between the normal running loop 309 and the face of the car body or door pillar 327. The outer face of the B pillar 327 can be shaped with a plurality of keyhole type slots 329 into which the largest diameter portion 312 of the latching plunger 301 can be fitted. In this modified version one avoids the need to use the compression spring 318, the biassing spring 311, the locating member 315 and the track 319 of the embodiment shown in Figures 12 to 16. The method of adjustment of this anchorage is however the same as that described above in relation to the fifth embodiment. Figures 18 and 19 show a seventh embodiment of the present invention. The adjustable shoulder belt anchorage of Figures 18 and 19 comprises a movable member 401 having a belt support in the form of an elongate metal guide or running loop 402 carried at the lower end of a generally flat plate member 404.The plate member 404 is formed from an elongate metal strip folded on itself centrally about one long side of the running loop 402, the loop being held to the plate member so that its plane projects diagonally downwardly andoutwardly from the plate member. Above the running loop 402, the plate member 404 is generally rectangular except for a rounded upper end it is provided along its vertical axis with a symmetrical elongate aperture 405. From the semicircular lower end of the aperture 406, the aperture sides taper uniformly inwards to a restriction 406 in a pear shaped pattern which is repeated above the restriction, in that the aperture broadens out over circular arcs to the diameter of the lower end and then again narrows to the next restriction 406, the pattern being again repeated up to the upper end of the aperture, at which the arcuate sides are continued to join together. Co operating with the movable member 401 is a fixed member 410 having an externally screw threaded end portion 411 received in a tapped hole 412 provided in a vehicle frame, for example, in a pillar 414 between the front and rear doors of a private motor car. Such a hole is conventionally provided to receive a fixed belt support means. Adjoining the end portion 411, the fixed member 410 has an inner cylindrical portion 415 of slightly greater diameter providing a step which abuts against the pillar around the tapped hole 412. From the cylindrical portion 415, the member 410 flares outwardly over a frustoconical portion 416 which ends with an outer cylindrical portion 418 of about the thickness of the plate member 404.At the free end of the outer, larger diameter, cylindrical portion 418, the fixed member410 has a head 419 which may be shaped, for example hexagonally, so as to facilitate mounting of the fixed member into the hole 412. The fixed member 410 is received through the aperture 404 of the movable member and, however shaped, the head 419 has a transverse dimension greater than the greatest width of the aperture, so that the movable member 401 is trapped between the head and the pillar 414. The diameter of the larger cylindrical portion 418 corresponds to the greatest width of the aperture 405 and the diameter of the smaller cylindrical portion 415 corresponds to the width of the restrictions 406. Spring means in the form of a frustoconical coiled compression spring 420 acts between the pillar 414 and the adjacent face of the plate member 404 to cause this to abut the fixed element head 419, the outer cylindrical portion 418 being received in the lowermost, as shown, or in another of the four wider portions of the aperture 405. When it is desired to adjust the anchorage to vary the height of the running loop 402, the movable member 401 is pushed towards the pillar 414 against the force of the spring 420 until the inner cylindrical portion 415 of the plate member is received in the apertures 405.In this condition, the movable plate member 401 can be raised or lowered freely release of the pressure urging the movable member towards the pillar 414 will permit the spring 420 to return the movable member outwardly, away from the pillar, with the cylindrical portion 418 received in the nearest wide portion of the aperture.The frustoconical fixed member portion 416 guides the movable member to such an end position of it is not exactly registered with the intended aperture portion. In the adjustable shoulder anchorage of Figures 20 and 21, a movable member 421 comprises a running loop 422 and a plate member 424 of substantially the same shape, size and structure as the equivalent elements ofFigures 18 and 19, plate member being however provided with an elongate aperture 425 which again extends along the vertical axis of the member but which is of different shape. As appears from Figure 20, the aperture 425 comprises a series of parallel sided restrictions 426 joining wider aperture portions 428 formed by circular arcs. The aperture 425 thus corresponds to a series of circular holes joined by a slot of lesser width than the hole diameter. A fixed member 430 of the shoulder anchorage ofFigures 20 and 21 comprises a bolt with a head 431 and a screw threaded shank 432 received in the tapped hole 412 in the vehicle door pillar 414. Trapped between thepillar 414 and the bolt head 431 is a spacer 435 having adjacent the bolt head a portion 436 with arcuate ends lying on a circle of the same diameter as the portions 428 of the aperture 425, the arcuate ends being joined by horizontal plane portions spaced apart by a distance corresponding to the width of the restrictions 426. The bolt head 431 is omitted fromFigure 20 so that the shape of the spacer portion 436 can be seen. Between the portion 436 and the pillar 414, the spacer 435 has a cylindrical portion 438 of greater diameter than that of the aperture portions 428. The movable member 421 is received on the fixed member 431 with the portion 436 received in the aperture 425 so the plate member 424 is trapped between the spacer cylindrical portion 438 and the bolt head 431. Spring means in the form of a dished spring washer 439 acts between the spacer portion 438 and the plate member 424. It will be clear from Figure 20 that the movable member 421 will remain securely mounted on the fixed member 430 as long as the axis of the former does not approach the horizontal. Adjustment of the level of the loop 422 can however be effected by rotating the movable member 421 about the spacer 435 through 900 in either direction. The movable member can then be moved horizontally, because the planar sides of the spacer portion 436 can be received between the restrictions 426 in the aperture 425. When the desired adjustment has been made, the movable member 421 can be allowed to fall back to a generally vertical position as shown inFigure 20, which the spacer portion 436 received in a selected one of the portions 425 of the aperture 425.It will be noted that the spring washer 439 does not have to be substantially stressed in order to allow adjustment to be made but serves to keep the relatively movable part of the anchorage in abutment to prevent rattle and oppose undesired rotation of the movable member 421. The anchorage embodying the invention shown inFigures 22 to 24 comprises a track 530 in the general form of a channel member having a rear web 531, side webs 532 and front webs 534 extending inwardly from the forward edges of the side webs. The track 530 is provided with pairs of opposed cut outs 535 in the free edges of front webs 534. The track 530 has an upper extension portion of the rear web 531 with an aperture 536 for securement of the track to the vehicle. The lower end of the rear web 531 has a downwardly and rearwardly extending tong 538 having an aperture 547. A carrier slide 510 received within the track 530 has upper and lower parallel plate portions, which are spaced apart so that the slide approximates in width to the spacing between the front 534 and rear 531 webs of the track, and which merge together by way of a central portion 511. A forward facing ridge 512 at the top of the upper slide portion 514 can be received in the cut outs 535 and the ridge merges with a circular boss 515 also projecting forwardly from the upper slide portion. The boss projects beyond the front webs 534 and is tapped to receive a bolt 516 for supporting a bracket 504, which consists of a plate 505 folded around a running loop 506 for a seat belt 501 see Figure 23 .The plate 505 has an aperture which receives the bolt 516. The forward projection of the ridge 512 is small enough for it to be received within the track 530 for movement therealong by pivotation of the slide about an axis extending through the central portion 511. This pivotation is opposed by a torsion spring 540 acting between the slide and the rear web 531 of the frame.The spring has two aligned coil portions 541 joined by a downwardly extending U shaped intermediate portion 542 bent rearwardly to bear against the web 531 and having at their outer ends downwardly extending arm portions 544 which bear against the inner surface of the upper plate portion. At the lower ends of the portions 544, out turned ends are received in aligned apertures formed in side flanges at the central portion 511 of the slide. As can be seen in Figure 24, the spring 540 normally urges the carrier slide forwardly in the track so that the ridge 512 securely engages in the cut outs 535. The forward component of tension in the belt 501 produced by the belt retracting force of the retractor not shown from which the belt 501 extends or by the user of the belt enhances this engagement. For movement along the track 530, the top of the slide is pivoted inwardly so that the ridge 512 lies inwardly of the front webs 534. The track 530 of the anchorage can be secured to the B post of the vehicle in which it is to be used, as by bolts not shown at each end extending through apertures such as the aperture 536 in the rear webs 131 of the tracks130 into tapped holes in the post, which is usually box sectioned. It may be that only one such tapped hole is available and the lower end of the track may then be secured as shown in Figures 22 and 24 or Figures 25 and 26. In Figures 22 and 24, the tong 538 of the rear web 531 is received in a slot 539 Figure 24 in the front wall 540 of the vehicle B post. The tong 538 and the wall 540 can be provided with registering holes respectively, of which the hole 547 of the tong 538 can be tapped, for reception of a bolt 542 of like fastener. Instead, as shown in Figure 25, the lower end of the rear web 531 has a rearwardly extending tong 545 with a neck receivable in the stem of a T shaped slot 546 in the front wall 540 of the B post. The anchorage described can include a cover 520, suitably of plastics material which makes a snap fit over the bracket 504 as shown in Figure 23. The anchorages shown in Figures 1 to 21, can also be fitted with suitable plastics covers. Although the movable members illustrated in the drawings include belt support means in the form of guide or running loops for use with seat belt systems in which the belt extends upwardly from a retractor to the loop and then diagonally downwardly across the torso of the user, it will be understood that other forms of belt support means can be included, for example, detachable guide loops or detachable on permanent connections to belt ends where the belt is part of a static system without a retractor.
