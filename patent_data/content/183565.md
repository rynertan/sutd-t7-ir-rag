# Method and apparatus for checking articles against a standard.

## Abstract
A computer operates on manufacturing apparatus to measure articles 15 processed in the apparatus and to approve and select or reject the reviewed and measured articles 15 in accordance with parameters established by an optical system. This optical system on sensing an inspected article 15 forms an image on a photosensitive random access memory 16 and information relating to the image is sorted in an electronic system 17 . The image information which is transmitted in bits, includes dimensional values, such as height, width and length, and the operation selects and approves articles 15 which are being detected as being within a predetermined average deviation in these dimen sions. The information on the predetermined average deviation of dimensions is established by checking a representative number of articles 15 . In the selection process bits from the sensing of the inspected article 15 are read from the photosensitive memory 16 and compared with stored data. If a significant difference is detected the inspected article 15 is rejected.
