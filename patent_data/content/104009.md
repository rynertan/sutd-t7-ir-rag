# Process for making cross linked carboxymethyl hydroxyethyl cellulose.

## Abstract
A water soluble carboxymethyl hydroxyethyl cellulose having a carboxymethyl degree of substitution of about 0.1 to about 0.25, preferably of about 0.15 to about 0.20, and having a hydroxyethyl molar substitution of greater than about 1.0 possesses unexpected qualities. When this com position is crosslinked with a suitable aluminum ion in an aqueous solution it forms a gel which exhibits no significant thinning at temperatures less than about 200 F.
