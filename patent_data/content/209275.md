## Description
BENZ TRISUBSTITUTED 2 AMINOTETRALINS This invention comprises new halodihydroxy benzsubstituted 2 aminotetralins which have potent and selective dopaminergic activity as well as medical methods and compositions using them. Background of the Invention 6,7 Dihydroxy 2 aminotetralin ADTN is known to be a dopaminergic agent with potent stimulating agonist activity at both D1 and D2 receptors in the peripheral dopaminergic systems. D2 receptors are located presynaptically. Agonistic activity at D2 sites inhibits the natural release of norepinephrine, G.N. Woodruff, TIPS 1982 59 1982 . A series of overseas patents by J. Pless, such asSwiss Patents 637,373, 637,364 and, especially, 637,363, describe compounds whose structures have two or three mixed halohydroxy substituents in the tetralin nucleus.The compounds are described to have stimulating activity at and ss adrenoceptors as well as at dopamine receptors.In our tests, selected representatives of this series have been demonstrated to have reduced dopaminergic activity and little selectivity over ADTN itself. Description of the Invention The compounds of this invention are illustrated by the following structural formula EMI2.1 in which R1 and R2 are, each, hydrogen, n propyl, g butyl or 4 hydroxyphenethyl X is hydrogen or halo such as fluoro, bromo or chloro and Y is, when X is hydrogen, halo or when X is halo, hydrogen. The pharmaceutically acceptable, acid addition salts of the bases of formula I are also included in this invention such as the hydrohalide, sulfate, phosphate, sulfamate, ethanedisulfonate, methanesulfonate or maleate salts. Also included in this invention are the optical isomers of the compounds of formula I. These are isolated by the methods used in the prior art for resolving ADTN. One skilled in the art will recognize that the compounds of this invention are the 5 or 8 halo derivatives of ADTN. The Swiss patents, which are mentioned above, describe the preparation of ADTN congeners whose structures have a hydroxy substituent along with one or two halo substituents in the benz ring of ADTN. Such compounds are less potent then ADTN in the tests described below. On the other hand, the compounds of formula I are very potent dopaminergic compounds and demonstrate selectivity of action at the pre and post synaptic sites as well. The following data in standard protocols to determine receptor binding at the D1 and D2 sites are selected to demonstrate the unexpected potency and selectivity of the dopaminergic compounds of this invention. Other tests have been run on many of these compounds but are not believed relevant to a fair demonstration of the biological properties of the compounds of this invention. A D2 Activity Competition for 3H Spiro peridol in Bovine Anterior Pituitary Tissue.Test Procedure The assay was performed using homogenized and washed membrane preparations from bovine anterior pituitary. Incubation proceeded for 20 minutes at 370 in 50 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.4, containing 10 mM magnesium sulfate, 2 mM ethylenediamine tetra acetic acid and 0.1 ascorbate. The membrane bound radioactivity was trapped by rapid filtration over glass fiber GF C filters. In each experiment, the amount of 3H spiroperidol bound was determined in the absence total and presence nonspecific of 1016 M butaclamol, the difference yielding specific 3H spiroperidol binding . The ability of each compound to compete with 3H spiroperidol approximately .25 nM was tested at concentrations of 10 7 and 10 5.If a compound was found to displace spiroperidol by 50 at a concentration of 10 5 M, it was considered to have significant activity and was further tested to obtain an IC50 for competition against spiroperidol. The h ind keg of a compound was cal culated from the equation KB IC50 1 L RD whereL is the concentration of 3H spiroperidol and KD is the equilibrium dissociation constant for spiroperidol 0.3 nM . B D1 Activity Competition for 3H Fenoldopam in Rat Striatum Tissue. Test Procedure The assay was performed using homogenized and washed membrane preparations from rat caudate nuclei. Tissues were preincubated for 15 min at 370 in 50 mM Tris SC1, pH 7.4, 10 mM magnesium sulfate, 2 mM ethylenediamine tetra acetic acid and 0.1 ascorbate. The binding assay was then carried out in the above buffet also containing 10 pM pargyline, 3H fenoldopam and test compounds. The membrane bound radioactivity was trapped by rapid filtra tion over glass fiber GF C filters. In each experiment the amount of 3H fenoldopam bound was determined in the absence total and presence non specific of 10 6 M butaclamol, the difference yielding specific 3H fenoldopam binding. The ability of each compound to compete with 3z fenoldopam approximately 2.0 nM was tested at concentrations of 10 7 and 10 6M.If a compound was found to displace fenoldopam by 50 at a concentration of 10 , it was considered to have significant activity and was further tested to obtain an IC50 for competition against fenoldQiam. The KBind KB of a compound was calculated from the equation P IC50 1 L K where L is the concentration of H fenoldopam and RD is the equilibrium dissociation constant for fenoldopam 2.0 nM .

The potency and selectivity of representative compounds of this invention are demonstrated by these data.Compounds A, 8 and C, which are N substituted, have D2 to D1 ratios of from about 2 to 1 to about 10 to 1. ADTN has a reverse ratio of 1 to 3 see Compound H of Table II below . It is known to the art that selective D2 activity is desirable for treating abnormal conditions by means of the dopamine receptor system U.s. 4,465,692 . On the other hand, the primary amine series of this invention, for example D G, show a greater D1 selectivity than does ADTN compound D, 1 to 7 E, 1 to 27 and G, 1 to 80. In certain cardiovascular conditions, this may be of advantage. The data in Table II were derived from testing the prior art compounds. The same headings as in Table I are used.

In addition to the data in Table I, Compound G demonstrated potent natriuretic acitivity in the spontaneous hypertensive rat protocol at a hypotensive dose 3.12 mg kg i.p. while ADTN was inactive as a natriuretic at hypotensive doses. Compounds D, E, F, G and H of Tables I and II have also demonstrated a2 activity in the clonidine binding protocol. In the standard rabbit ear artery protocol for pre junctional dopaminergic activity, the fluoro congeners also demonstrated very potent activity compared with their chloro counterparts Compound D, EC50 of 2.14 nM Compound E,EC50 of 5.0 nM Compound F, EC50 of 50 nM andCompound G, EC50 of 513 nM. The compounds of this invention are prepared by the fqllowing reaction sequences EMI6.1 EMI7.1 Each of the reaction sequences, which may be used by one skilled in the art to prepare the compounds of this invention and are outlined above, involve the insertion of a 2 amino function into a tetralin which is trisubstituted in the benz ring. The amino function may be generated by a Curtius rearrangement of a 2 carboxy functional group A or B or by reacting a 2 keto group with an amine C . In each of the sequences, the primary amine,Compound 3, 7 or 11, whose 6,7 dihydroxy system is protected, is optionally N alkylated to prepare the preferred N alkylated compounds of formula I. The alkylation usually proceeds stepwise by means of a reductive alkylation using an aldehyde in a reducing milieu or using reaction with an acyl halide to form an amide which is then reduced, for example by borane. The protective groups are removed using any ether splitting agent such as hydrobromic acid, hydriodic acid, boron tribromide or boron trichloride. Details of these sequences and preparation of starting materials are present in the illustrative examples below. The compounds of this invention have utility, as specific dopamine agonists, in the treatment of disorders of the cardiovascular system, especially to treat hypertension, to treat angina pectoris, to treat the symptoms of congestive heart failure or to improve kidney blood flow. The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, which have pharmacodynamic activity within the cardiovascular system, are prepared in conventional dosage unit forms by incorporating a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable isomer or acid addition salt thereof, into a nontoxic pharmaceutical carrier according to accepted pharmacy procedures in a nontoxic quantity sufficient to produce the desired pharmacodynamic activity in an animal or human patient. Preferably, the compositions will contain the active ingredient in an active but nontoxic quantity which is selected from the range of about 25 mg to about 300 mg, preferably about 100 250 mg of active ingredient, as the base, per dosage unit.This quantity is selected by considering the specific biological activity desired, the route of administration, that is, whether oral or parenteral, and the condition and size of the patient. The pharmaceutical carrier employed for the dosage units is, for example, either a solid or liquid.Exemplary of solid carriers are lactose, terra alba, sucrose, talc, gelatin, agar, pectin, acacia, magnesium stearate or stearic acid. Exemplary of liquid carriers are isotonic saline for parenteral use or syrup, peanut oil, olive oil or water for soft gelatin capsules.Similarly, the carrier or diluent may include any time delay material well known to the art, such as cellulose esters or ethers and glyceryl esters alone or admixed with a wax. A wide variety of pharmaceutical forms can be employed. Thus, if a solid carrier for oral, trans dermal or rectal administration is used, the mixed preparation can be tableted, placed in a hard gelatin capsule in powder or sustained release pellet form, dermal patch, in a suppository or in the form of a troche or lozenge. The amount of solid carrier will vary widely but, preferably, will be from about 25 mg to about 1 g per dose. If a liquid carrier is used, the preparation will be in the form of a syrup, emulsion, soft gelatin capsule, sterile injection liquid for an ampul or multidose vial, an aqueous or nonaqueous liquid suspension for oral administration, or a trans dermal device. Advantageously, doses selected from the dosage unit ranges given above will be administered several times, such as from one to five times, a day. The daily dosage regimen is selected from the range of about 100 mg to about 1.0 g, preferably 100 500 mg for oral administration and 25 250 mg for parenteral administration. When the method described above is carried out, selective dopaminergic activity is produced. The following examples are designed solely to illustrate the preparation and use of the compounds of this invention. The temperatures herein are Centigrade.Other variations of these examples will be obvious to those skilled in the art.

EXAMPLE 8 General Method for N Alkylating 6 ,7 dimethoxy 2 aminotetralins A 6,7 dimethoxy 2 aminotetralin 20 mmol was heated with 20 ml of propionic anhydride at 1000 for 2 hours. The solution was poured into water and the mixture was extracted with methylene chloride. The organic extract was washed 5 aqueous sodium bicarbonate, water, brine , dried and concentrated. To a stirred solution of the residue N propionamide in 2 ml of tetrahydrofuran under nitrogen was added 30 ml of 1 M borane in tetrahydrofuran.The stirred mixture was refluxed for 4 hours, cooled, and 2.5 N hydrochloride acid was added until the evolution of gas stopped. The mixture was heated at 1000, allowing the tetrahydrofuran to evaporate. The resulting solid was collected. This hydrochloride was converted to the base which was again propionylated and reduced in the same manner to give an N,N dipropyl derivative. In most instances, the resulting aqueous solution of hydrochloride was converted to the base by addition of 2 N sodium hydroxide. The base was extracted with ethyl acetate.The extracts were washed with water, dried and concentrated to afford residual tertiary amine that was converted into a hydrochlor ide in an organic solvent with hydrogen chloride gas.
