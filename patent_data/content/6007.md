# Speed reduction mechanism for semi trailer landing gear.

## Abstract
A semi trailer landing gear speed reduction mechanism is provided which includes two horizontally disposed parallel spaced shafts with one shaft 32 being rotated by a manual crank means 38 and the other shaft 40 connected to a mechanism for raising and lowering the landing gear. A two speed ratio for the mechanism is provided by having a fixed pair of gears 44, 46 secured to the driven shaft 40 , a pinion gear 50 fixed to driving shaft 32 and a gear 52 having both internal and external threads 54 and 56 supported on its internal threads 54 on the driving shaft and in engagement with a pinion gear 46 on the driven shaft. The drive shaft 32 is axially shiftable between a first position in which the last said gear 52 is free to rotate about the driving shaft and the pinion gear 50 secured to the driving shaft is in driving engagement with a gear 44 on the driven shaft 40 , and a position in which the pinion gear 50 on the driving shaft is in engagement with the internal threads 54 on the floating gear 52 which in turn drivingly engages with its external threads 56 the pinion gear 46 secured to the driven shaft.
