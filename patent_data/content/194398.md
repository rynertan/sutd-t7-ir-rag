## Description
t A box table convertible into a bed The present invention relates generally to furniture and more particularly to convertible furniture able to provide additional sleeping accommodation for occasional use.Convertible furniture for this purpose is known, and there are various types of convertible armchairs, sofas, bed settees and the like commercially available.These are employed in circumstances where there are problems of space, or when it is considered necessary to have available extra beds for occasional use to cope with any possible eventuality. The additional seating this provides is not always required, however, and the present invention seeks to provide an item of convertible furniture which converts, when necessary, into a bed but which, instead of being formed as a conventional sofa or armchair, is in a form similar to that of a low table or chest. According to the present invention there is provided a box table convertible into a bed, characterised by the fact that it comprises a box body of generally rectangular form having a tippable closure cover and within which body there is housed a foldable bed frame a first portion of which is joined by means of a parallelogram linkage to the bottom of the box, the bed frame further comprising second and third portions pivotally joined together in such a way as to be foldable between a collapsed and an erected position, the second and third frame portions being displaceable out from the box body and being provided with support frames joined by linkages extending between the first and second portions and the second and third portions of the bed frame respectively in such a way that the support frames are automatically displaced by the linkages into a position of use as the bed frame is unfolded out of the box to its erected position. An advantage of the present invention is that it provides furniture, convertible into a bed, which is structurally simple and only requires operations which are easy to perform for converting it into a bed. Another advantage of the present invention is that it provides furniture, convertible into a bed, which is aesthetically pleasing and adaptable to any type of furnishing. One embodiment of the present invention will now be more particularly described by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a perspective view of a low table or chest formed as an embodiment of the invention Figure 2 is a similar perspective view of the embodiment of Figure1 with the table top raised Figures from 3 to 6 schematically illustrate the sequence of operations for converting the table or chest of the present invention into a bed.Referring now to the drawings, the convertible table of the invention is constituted by a rectangular box body 1 of any suitable dimensions and with any desired cladding to the side walls. A plate like element 3 is connected by means of an articulated arm 2, to the box body 1. Along two parallel sides the platelike member 3 carries respective slide guides 4, the purpose of which is t6 receive a lid 5 by prismatic coupling. The dimensions of the lid 5 are such that it projects outwardly beyond the said box body 1 constituting the upper closure thereof and forming in effect a table top of the low table. To the bottom of the said box like body 1, and close to the lateral walls thereof, there are pivoted two pairs of arms 6 and 7, one pair of which is not visible in the drawings the rotation of which is suitably biased by a tension coil spring not illustrated .The two arms 6, 7 of each pair are connected to a respective upper cross piece 8 to which is fixed a first portion 9 of an articulated bed frame having three sections to which a mattress 10 is secured.The articulated bed frame comprises a first, generally C shape portion pivotally connected to a second or intermediate portion 11 which also carries a part of the mattress 10. This intermediate portion 11 is fixed to an operating shackle 12, provided with a handle 13 by which it can be grasped andmoved, and articulated thereto by means of an arm 14, is a wideU shape support frame 15 which, upon erection of the bed, can adopt by the action of the arm 14, a vertical orientation as shown in Figures 5 and 6.To the said intermediate portion there is articulated, in the same way, the third portion 16 of the bed frame, which also supports and is fixed to a part of the mattress 10. This third. portion 16 also is of a generally C shape configuration and is provided with a wide U shape support frame 17 capable of adopting a vertical orientation as shown in Figure 6 by the linking action of a pair of pivoted arms 18 and 181. The intermediate portion 11 of the said articulated frame carries a casing 19 in a position underlying the mattress 10, the casing 19 being provided with a suitable aperture closable by means of a zip fastener 20 and able to contain a pillow 21 and bed linen in general.On the internal face of the plate like element 3 constituting the support for the table top, there may be provided a pocket 22, a reading lamp 23, a clock 24 and or other suitable accessories.Moreoever, the tippable lid 5 constituting the table top can have any surface finish according to the various requirements of furnishing for example, in the embodiment illustrated in Figure 1, it is provided with a sheet of glass or a mirror 25 enclosed by a frame 26 which is aesthetically. adaptable to any material or cladding of the box body 1.
