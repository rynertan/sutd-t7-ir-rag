## Description
Title Ion Concentration Measurement System that Employs Measuring and Reference Field Effect Transistor Electrodes Sensitive to the Same Ion. The present invention generally relates to an ion concentration measurement system, more particularly to a system that is capable of being incorporated into a catheter for in vivo measuring and monitoring of the concentration of an ion within the human body. The system includes a measuring electrode and a reference electrode, both of which are ion sensitive field effect transistor ISFET transducers that are both sensitive to the same ion. A differential circuit connects the measuring ISFET and the reference ISFET so that changes in one ISFET will be measured as a real output signal and that changes in both ISFET S will not result in an output signal.The reference ISFET is structured so that it is in contact with a rinsing liquid having a known composition and a known ion concentration. Systems for monitoring and measuring ion concen trations have been devised and used in order to measure and monitor ion activity within liquids such as human blood.Some such systems incorporate an electrode that employs anISFET component. ISFET components are field effect transistors for the selective measurement of the concentratipnr or pl, of an ion within a liquid. Often, these systems are used in order to measure and monitor the hydrogen ion con centration, or pH, of a liquid such as blood. A variety of reference electrodes have been proposed for use in conjunction with measuring ISFET electrode components, UnitedStates Letters Patent No. 4,020,830 describes reference electrodes in this regard, while other systems employ an ion selective electrode such as an Ag AgCl electrode as the reference electrode which is in contact with a liquid of constant concentration.One difficulty with using an ionselective electrode as the reference electrode is that such electrodes measure ionic concentrations and when this concentration changes such electrodes change their reference potential, which results in undesirable inconsistency and inaccuracy with respect to the entire measuring system.Ideally, a reference electrode should provide a steady reference potential within the electrochemical circuit of this type of device, particularly when the device is used for in vivo beasurement and monitoring of physiologically important pI parameters. Preferably, these types of devices are sized and structured so as to be capable of being placed in vivo within the bloodstream or the like, typically by means of a catheter structure. Such structures are superior to devices having electrodes that are adhered to the patient s skin, which is a less desirable approach in view of the unstable skin electrode interface and their characteristic of requiring a relatively long distance between the active electrode and the reference electrode. Such devices are also difficult to apply in connection with continuous blood analysis in extra corporal blood circuits such as those utilized during hemodialysis and open heart surgical procedures.Accordingly, it is advantageous to carry out in vivo ion concentration measurements with a system that incorporates a catheter structure in order to achieve in vivo measurements within the bloodstream or the like. Other electrical measuring systems for measuring ion concentrations include a pH FET and a reference FET component. In some such systems both FET components are contacted with the liquid to be measured, such as the blood, one such FET component being coated with a pH sensitive layer and the other FET component being coated with a membrane that is intended to be insensitive to any and all ions. This latter feature is not readily achieved inasmuch as it is exceedingly difficult to manufacture a membrane that is truly ion insensitive. The present invention provides a system for in vivo ion concentration measurement and monitoring, such as that carried out within the bloodstream of a patient, which system does not experience substantial drift, and which system is designed so that both the measuring component and the reference component are sensitive to one and the same ion so that the measuring component and the reference component will exhibit substantially identical sensitivities. In an important aspect of this invention, the measuringISFET transducer component and the reference ISFET transducer component are connected together by means of a differential circuit so that corresponding changes in the behaviour of both ISFET S will be compensated by the differential circuit, typical changes in behavior being the result of variations such as drift, temperature changes, aging and the like.Additionally, the reference ISFET component includes a structure so that the reference ISFET can be contacted with a rinsing liquid of known, and typically constant, composition and ion concentration. Most advantageously, the system is incorporated into a catheter structure suitable for direct incorporation into the bloodstream or the like of the patient. It is accordingly a general object of the present invention to provide an improved ion concentration measurement system that is particularly well suited for in vivo usage. Another object of the present invention is to provide a device for ion concentration measurement that is especially stable with respect to inaccuracies that can develop due to drift, temperature changes, aging and the like, while also providing a device that is especially precise and sensitive to changes in the ion concentration being measured or monitored. Another object of this invention is to provide an improved ion concentration and measurement system which may be calibrated during in vivo measurements. These and other objects, features and advantages of this invention will be clearly understood through a consideration of the following detailed description. In the course of this description, reference will be made to the attached drawings, wherein Fig. 1 is an elevational view of a typical catheter structure suitable for incorporating the ion concentration measurement system in accordance with this invention Fig. 2 is a generally schematic longitudinal sectional view of Fig. 1 Fig. 3 is a schematic diagram of the differential circuit by which the measuring and reference FET components are connected and Fig. 4 is a schematic illustration of the voltage drops that occur within the ion concentration measuring system according to this invention. Fig. 1 shows a catheter 6 adapted for insertion into a human bloodstream, which catheter 6 has a top portion 7, within which a measuring ISFET electrode component 1 Fig. 2 is mounted. This measuring ISFET electrode component 1 is positioned such that same will contact blood A at an opening 11 through the wall of the catheter top 7.A pair of electrical conductors 12 connect the electrical components of the measuring ISFET transducer electrode 1 to suitable known FET structures and circuitry, such connection being to the so called drain and source locations associated with the measuring ISFET electrode component 1.Electrical conductors 12 pass through a lumen 9 that is longitudinally positioned throughout the catheter 6 in the direction of arrow Q, such being facilitated by suitable electrical contacts 14 Fig. 1 . An annular metal electrode 5 connects the catheter top 7 to the main body portion of the catheter 6, This annular metal electrode is connected within the electrical measuring system to function as a ground for the system in accordance with known principles. This metal electrode 5 is desirable inasmuch as it provides stability as a ground within the system, but it is not necessarily essential to the operation of the measuring circuit. A reference ISFET transducer electrode 2 is mounted within another lumen 8 of the catheter 6. The wires of electrode 2 pass through lumen 9. Lumen 8 and lumen 9 are separated from each other within the catheter 6 and are substantially longitudinally parallel with each other throughout the catheter 6 until a bifurcation 3 at a proximal location along the catheter 6. The electrical contacts 14 pass out of one branch of the bifurcation 3, while a tube 4 extends beyond the other branch of the bifurcation 3 for receiving a length tubing 15 or the like for communication to a source of rinsing liquid not shown . The referenceISFET electrode component 2 preferably includes a chipmounted pH FET and an Ag AgCl ion selective electrode. An opening 13 is provided through the wall of the lumen 8 in the vicinity of, and preferably somewhat distally of, the reference ISFET electrode component 2.By this structure, the rinsing liquid can flow from its source, through the tube 4 and out the opening 13 in accordance with the flowB illustrated in Fig. 2. This rinsing liquid is of a constant pH and pcl. Of course the principle also works when the reference FET is sensitive to K and the rinsing fluid has a constant K concentration or for a Na FET and constant Na concentration in the rinsing fluid etc. In use for actual measurement of the parameters of the blood A, the catheter 6 is inserted into the bloodstream such that the measuring ISFET electrode component 1 is in contact with the blood A and adjusts itself to the ion concentration, typically the pH, of the blood. At this time, the reference ISFET electrode component 2 is in contact with the rinsing liquid B and has a constant gate potential VG2r provided the ion concentration, typically the pH of the rinsing liquid, and the liquid junction potential are kept constant. With the measuring ISFET electrode component 1 and the reference ISFET electrode component 2 of the measuring system being connected by a differential circuit as shown in Fig. 2, typically a bridge circuit, corresponding changes in the behavior of the measuring ISFET electrode component 1 or the reference ISFET electrode 2 will result in a corresponding change in the output of the differential circuit. Equal changes in ISFET electrode 1 and reference electrode 2 will not give a change in output signal because of the differential nature of the circuit. Those equal changes may be due to drift, temperature changes, aging, and the like.Components included in the ion concentration measurement system of generally known construction include an electrical voltage source for applying the drain source voltage VDS within each FET component 1 and 2, a voltage source for applying the gate voltage VGS between the source and gate via the fluid and the metal band, an amplifier system, and appropriate current conductive wiring for electrically interconnecting the various components. Details regarding these particular components will be known to those skilled in the art. With particular reference to the voltage drop diagram of Fig. 4, the voltage V0 to be measured is given by the following equation EMI8.1 where EMI8.2 trans transconductance of the FET PLJ uid junction potential constant 1 2 pHblood PHblood PHrinsing liquid Consequently V0 v a The actual pH value of the blood measured in accordance with this invention is obtained by adding the pH value of the rinsing liquid to the QpH that is actually measured by the differential circuit. If desired or necessary, an in vivo calibration of the ion concentration measurement system according to this invention can be performed in a relatively simple manner. First, the reference ISFET electrode component 2, with its Ag AgCl electrode, is exposed to the rinsing liquid, and the instrument is set to the ion concentration, typically the pH value, of the rinsing liquid. In a subsequent, second step, blood is admitted into the lumen 8 and into contact with the reference ISFET electrode component 2, and the output signal SO of the differential circuit is noted. If the VO has a value of other than zero mVolts, then the setting of the measuring ISFET electrode component 1 is adjusted until the magnitude of the output signal VO of the differential circuit is zero mVolts.Before employing the ion concentration measurement system to accomplish actual measurement or monitoring, the blood within the lumen 8 can be expelled from the lumen 8 by means of the rinsing liquid, after which the ion concentration measurement system is suitably calibrated and ready for use. By the first calibrating step, in which the reference ISFET electrode component is exposed to the rinsing liquid, a possible missetting of the reference SFET electrode component 2 is corrected, while in the second calibrating step, a possible mis setting of the measuring ISFET electrode component 1 is corrected. It is also possible to perform an in vivo calibration of the ion concentration measurement system according to this invention of which the reference FET electrode is not provided with a on chip Ag AgCl electrode in following manner. First blood is admitted into the lumen 8 and into contact with the reference ISFET electrode component 2, which for example is a pH FET, and the output signal VO of the differential circuit is noted. If the VQ has a value of other than zero molts, then the setting of the differential circuit is adjusted until the magnitude of the output signal VO of the differential circuit is zero molts. In a subsequent, second step, a rinsing fluid with a pH different from that of the original rinsing fluid is admitted into the lumen 8 and in contact with the reference ISFET electrode component 2, and the output signal VO of the differential circuit is noted.The output voltage V0 now should be in accordance with the pH difference between the pH value of this rinsing solution and that of the originally used rinsing solution. If the VO displays another value setting of the circuit is adjusted until the magnitude of the output voltage shows the proper value. Before employing the ion concentration measurement system to accomplish actual measurement or monitoring, the calibration rinsing solution in lumen 8 can be expelled from the lumen 8 by means of the original rinsing solution, after which the ion concentration measurement is suitably calibrated and ready for use. The first calibrating step in which the referenceISFET electrode is exposed to blood a possible off set missetting between ISFET electrode 1 and 2 is corrected, while in the second step a possible change in pH sensitivity of the system is corrected. If the chip of the reference ISFET electrode component also includes a temperature sensor in vivo calibration is possible as discussed above, Additionally, such is accomplished without requiring special catheter construction and without the necessity of having to take blood samples by which by the calibration must be performed. Although it is desirable to have the referenceISFET electrode component 2 mounted at a location that is generally close to that of the measuring ISFET electrode component 1, such as the construction shown in Figs. 1 and 2, it is possible to mount the reference ISFET electrode component 2 at a more remote location, such as within the bifurcation 3, within the liquid connector or tube 4, or even within the external rinsing liquid system to which the tubing 15 is attached. It will be understood that the embodiments of the present invention which have been described are illustrative of some of the applications of the principles of the present invention. Numerous modifications may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention.
