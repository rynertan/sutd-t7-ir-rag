# Automotive vehicle power train.

## Abstract
An automotive vehicle includes a body with an engine compartment. Its power train includes an engine E with a crank shaft 9 and at least one cylinder 8 , mounted within the engine compartment with the crank shaft extending transversely to the length of the vehicle body and with the cylinder extending generally horizontally transmission means 12 with a power input shaft 13 , coupled to the engine with the power input shaft substantially coaxial with and rotationally driven from the engine crank shaft and a differential device 17 , driven from the transmission means, with an axial center line which is located substantially vertically below the center line 20 of the crank shaft. Thereby, the engine compartment can be made compact and low in height, and further the moments of inertia of the vehicle about its yaw and pitch axes can be kept low.
