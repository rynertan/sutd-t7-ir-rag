# Circuit board.

## Abstract
A circuit board is prepared such that at least two resin substrates 30, 31, 32 are laminated and bonded by thermocom pression, a circuit pattern 301, 303, 311 315, 321 325 made of a resin composition containing a conductor material is formed on at least one of opposing surfaces of the substrates 30, 31, 32 , a region of the substrate which corresponds to a specific portion of the circuit pattern 301, 303, 311 315, 321 325 is recessed, the specific portion of the circuit projects into the recess 302, 322 in accordance with plastic deformation of the substrates 30, 31, 32 and the circuit pattern 301, 303, 311 315, 321 325 which is caused by thermocompression bonding, and the specific portion of the circuit pattern 301, 303, 311 315, 321 325 constitutes an exposed portion. Multilayer or three dimensional wiring can be easily achieved in the circuit board.
