# Improved bipolar transistor construction.

## Abstract
A bipolar transistor structure and process for its manufacture. The structure includes an emitter region formed over a base region, and a thin wall of insulating material, such as a thermal oxide, along the edge of the emitter region. The wall of insulating material electrically isolates emitter and base contact areas, and greatly reduces the size of inactive portions of the base region, thereby reducing the base resistance and base collector capacitance, and increasing the speed of operation of the transistor. The wall of insulating material is formed by a process that eliminates at least one photolithographic patterning and etching operation found in conventional processes.
