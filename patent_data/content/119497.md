# Method of forming electrode wiring layer.

## Abstract
An interconnection structure including an electrode wir ing layer can be formed on a semiconductor substrate by form ing on the semiconductor substrate 10 an insulating struc ture having at least one recess 16 in a surface thereof. At least one polycrystalline silicon layer 18a, 18b is formed to fill the recess 16 of tne insulating structure 12 . Then, an alumi num layer 20 is formed to cover a surface of the insulating structure 12 and a surface of the polycrystalline silicon layer 18a, 18b . The polycrystalline silicon in the polycrystalline sili con layer 18a, 18b and the aluminum in a portion of the alumi num layer 20 which corresponds to the polycrystalline silicon layer 18a, 18b are converted into a single alloy by heating to form an electrode wiring layer comprising the single alloy in the recess 16 and connected to a remaining portion of the al uminum layer 20 .
