## Description
wGNS PLO w BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention generally relates to firearms and, more particularly, to gas actuated pistols.2. Description of the Prior Art Firearms which utilize for their operation gases which expand therein as a result of burnt propellants are known. The expanding gases are used to cause a slide to move aft for automatic or semi automatic operation. Among such firearms are pistols, such ad the one disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,657,960. The known pistols which utilize expanding gas, i.e. gas actuated firearms, include many parts and thus are complicated, difficult to take apart and reassemble, for cleaning or repairing. They are also quite expen sive. In addition they are not believed to provide sufficiently high accuracy and reliability. Furthermore they are not designed nor capable of use with reassembling large caliber ammunition such as 0.357 or 0.440 ammo. All of the known disadvantages of prior art gas operated pistols are believed to be overcome by the novel pistol of the present invention, which is gas actuated. The novel pistol of the present invention can be thought of as comprising a frame unit having a front section and a rear section, said front and rear sections terminating in fore and aft ends respectively, said front section being trough shaped defining a pair of spaced apart side walls and a bottom side for forming the bottom of said trough and interconnecting said side walls a barrel unit releasably lockable to said frame unit, comprising a barrel defining a bore fqr a bullet to pass therethrough, said bore havipg muzzle and breach ends, and front and rear locking members, for engaging said frame unit and be lockable to the front section thereof, said barrel defining aopath for gases having one end in communication with said bore proximate the breach end thereof, and extending along said barrel and a second end in communication with an elongated cavity defined in said front locking member, said cavity extending inwardly from an open end in a direction toward the fore end of said barrel unit a slidable unit slidable on said frame unit, said slidable unit including a front section shaped td slide under said barrel unit when the latter is locked to said frame unit, and an aft bolt receiving section, and pressure responsive means at the fore end of said front section adapted to respond to gas pressures in said cavity for applying a force in the aft direCtion to cause said slide unit to slide aft and bias means in contact with said frame and slide units, for applying a fore pressure to said slide unit to urge it toward the front locking member of said frame unit. As will be described hereafter in detail the front locking member, in addition to the cavity, is shaped so as to wrap around the fore end of the frame unit for added secure interlocking between the barrel and the frame unit. As to the slide unit, it includes a uniquely shaped bridge member which bridges the two slide walls on which the unit slides. The top side of the bridge member is curve shaped to accommodate the bottom round surface of the barrel so that the slide can slide under it. The bridge member also has a short downwardly pointing bar which is designed to engage a crossbar of a unique biasing unit, The crossbar is slidably supported on two rods on which specially designed coil springs are supported.A specially shaped piston extends fore of the bridge member into the cavity of the front locking member to be subjected to gas pressures therein and to apply an axial force in the aft direction to the bridge member and thus to the entire slide unit which in spite of the spring bias slides aft. A uniquely shaped bolt which is supported by the slide unit is included. A novel hammer driving unit formed as a kit which is releasably securable to the frame unit is included. By means of the hammer driving unit the length and pressure of the trigger of a two stage trigger system can be adjusted. Furthermore, the pistol includes a unique arrangement whereby the safety catch provides double safety in that it immobilizes the firing pin as well as disconnects the trigger from the hammer driving unit at the same time. The novel features of the invention are set forth with paricularity in the appended claims. The invention will best be understood from the following description when read in. conjunction with the accompanying drawings. Fig. 1 is a side view of the novel pistol Fig. 2 is an expanded isometric view of a major part thereof Fig. 3 is a cross sectional view of the novel barrel Figs. 4 and 5 are partial views useful in explaining significant features of the invention Fig. 6 is a combination side cross sectional view of the pistol Fig. 7 is a side view of a novel bout and Fig. 8 is a combination cross sectional block view of a novel hammer unit. Attention is first directed to Figs. 1 4 in connection with which the novel gas actuated pistol of the present invention will first be described. The pistol 10 is made up of three basic major units or parts. They include a frame unit or simply frame A, a barrel unit or simply barrel B and a slidable unit or simply slide C. It further includes other parts which will be described in detail. The latter, whether forming an integral part of one of the major units ot attached or supportable thereon, will generally be designated by a numeral followed by the letter of the unit, with which it is associated, as a suffix. As will become apparent from the following description of the pistol 10, its frame A, slide C and barrel B are easily assembled and disassembled for maintenance or repair. In Fig. 1 the pistol is shown fully assembled.The figure represents a side view of the pistol with its front or fore end through which a bullet or slug exists designated by lOf and its rear or aft end by lOr. The fore and aft ends of each of frame A, barrel B and slide C are designated by the numerals 11 and 12, respectively, followed by the unit s designa tion letter, e.g. llA and 12A, liB and 12B and llC and 12C. In Fig. 1 the pistol 10 is shown with slide C in its fore position. As shown in Fiq. 2, the frame A is designated as having a barrel accommodating section 13A, a trigger section 14a and a hammer unit accommodating section l5A. section 13A is trough or U shaped in crosssection and is formed by the vertical spaced apart side walls 16A which are joined together by a base 17A see Fig. 1 . Elongated grooves 19A are formed in the side walls 16A for facilitating the locking of the aft end 12B of the barrel B to frame A. As shown, the barrel unit B has an axial bore 16B extending from the barrel s fore end llB which represents the bore s muzzle end, to aft end 12B, representing the bore s breach end. Barrel B further includes front and rear barrel locking members 19B and 20B at the fore end llB and proximate aft end 12B, respectively.It is by means of these members that barrel B is releasably lockable to frame A through slide C. As will be described hereafter in detail in connection with Fig. 31 barrel B defines a unique path for gases produced as the bore s breach end through the barrel and through front locking member 19B, which provides the novel pistol with some of its unique advantages. The front locking member 19B can be viewed of as a block which represents the fore section of the pistol with a front side or face representing fore end llB and an opposite side 22B against which the fore end llC of the slice C is biased, as will be described.Member 19B is uniquely shaped in that it defines two symmetrical cavities 21B which extend inwardly from side 22B. They are shaped and spaced apart to accommodate therein the fore ends of side walls 16A of frameA, while the fore end of the bottom 17h of the frame side is accommodated in a recess under side 22B see Fig. 1 . Thus, when the barrel B is locked to frame A, the front or fore end llA of the frame is accommodated in front locking member B. The latter effectively is wrapped around the frame fore end llA, thereby enhancing the fore interlocking of the two units for enhanced pistol performance. In addition to cavities 21B in member 19B, an axial cavity 25B is formed therein see Figs. 2 and3 . The cavity extends inwardly from face 22B. The purpose of this cavity may best be explained in connection withFigs. 2 5. Fig. 3 is essentially a part.ial crosssectional view of barrel B. As shown therein, in addition to bore 16B formed therein, a cavity or path 30B is formed. It extends from the breach end 12B, then below and along the bore 16B but spaced therefrom and up to the bottom end of cavity 25B. As is known, when a bullet is fired the burned propellants produce gases at high pressure. In the present invention these gases are made to travel along path 30B and exit through cavity 25B. It is the pressure of these gases which is used to push the slide C aft against a bias force provided by an arrangement which will be described. Briefly, in section 13A of frame A a spring biasing assembly is located as shown in Fig. 4. It is located in the shaped trough of section 13A. It consists of two rods 25A on which springs 26A are wound. The aft ends of rods 25A are in appropriate grooves in wall 30A of the frame A while their other ends are supported on a horizontal plate 32A which is slidable on the rods. Attention is now directed to Figs. 1 and 5.Fig. 5 is an end view of slide C on frame A. As shown, the fore end of llC of slide C is shaped with a bridge like member 1SC which forms a bridge between side walls 13C of the slide. The top of the bridge member 15C is curved to accommodate the barrel B thereon. Extending from member 1SC is a cylindrical post 20C. It is this post or piston which is accommodated in cavity 25B of the front locking member l9B. In addition, extending downwardly from bridge member 15C below piston 20C is a protrusion like member or short bar 22C. It is bar 22C which presses against horizontal plate 22A. The par does not extend over the entire width of the.bridge as viewed in the fore to aft direction. The slide C has appropriate grooves 25C shaped in its opposite sides 13C see Fig. 1 fto facilitate the insertion of rear locking member 20B of barrel B into frame A. The locking. member 20B is inserted through grooves 25C in the slide and grooves.19A in the frame when the grooves are aligned and thereafter the front locking member 19B is positioned to accommodate the fore ends of sides 16A into openings 21B. Then the rear locking member 20B is locked in position with its aft side pressing against wall 30 and its fore side engaging a locking cam which is operable by turning a lever 35A see Fig. 1 . It should be appreciated that different arrangements may be employed to insert the aft end 12 of barrel B through slide C and lock it therein. In the assembled position, as shown in Fig.1, the barrel B is locked to the frame B. As to the slide C, it is biased fore by springs 26A pushing the plate 32A fore. It pushes arm 22C Fig. 5 fore and thus urges the slide C forward. In the assembled position the fore end llC of the slide abuts the rear wall 22B of the front locking member 19B, and the piston 20C is inside axial cavity 25B. In this position the slide C is biased fore by the springs 26A. When a bullet is fired gases are created by the burning propellants at the breach end 12B of barrelB. Due to the high gas pressure the bullet or slug is propelled out of the bore. In accordance with the present invention, as shown in Fig. 3 and as previously explained, gas path 30B is provided in the barrel.This path starts at the breach end whereat the gas pressure is very high and ends in axial cavity 25B.Thus high pressure is produced thereat. Since piton 20C of the slide C is present in the cavity, it is subjected to the high pressure and as a result it is pushed axially out of the cavity 25B in theft direction. Since the piston 20C is part of the bridge member 15C which in turn is part of the slide C, the entire slide is pushed aft against the bias forces of the springs which urge it forward By using the pressure of the gases at the breach end to drive the axial slide back, very improved performance is attained. As the slide C travels aft, the spent case in the breach end is extracted and the hammer 50A cocked. Once the gas force is less than that applies by the springs, the slide C moves fore, during which a new cartridge is extracted from the magazine and is inserted into the breach end. Finally, the slide C returns to its most fore position and the pistol with the cocked hammer is ready to be fired again. Attention is now directed to Fig. 6 which is a combination side view of the fore section of frame A and an isometric view of the aft section. Therein the hammer 50A is shown in the cocked position below a safety grip. As will be pointed out hereafter the hammer forms part of an easily removable hammer unit 55A. The entire hammer unit is held in position by two pins 56A and 57A which can be removed to repair or replace the hammer unit. Pin 57A is generally covered by a cover or held grip on the frame of the pistol handle in which a magazine is typically inserted.Numeral 59A designates the magazine latch. As shown in Fig. 6 a sear lever 80 extends from the hammer unit. It is essentially hook shaped.Its function is to engage a trigger bar 82 which is in turn controlled by the pistol trigger 60A. The cocking of the hammer pulls the sear level aft. It in turn pulls the trigger bar 82 aft and the trigger is pulled forward. By pressing the trigger the trigger bar 82 is pulled forward, pulling with it the sear lever. When pulled forward sufficisntly the spring holding the cocked hammer is released and the hammer is driven to strike the firing pin not shown . As shown in Fig. 6, the trigger bar 82 has a pair of ears 85 one being shown . When the safety catch 65C see Fig. 1 is turned to the safety position, inside slide C a cam presses on these ears 85. As a result, the trigger bar 82 is pressed down, clearing the sear lever 80. Thus, pressing on the trigger causes the trigger bar to move without engaging the sear lever. As shown in Fig. 2, at the breach end 12B of bore B locking lugs are shown. They are designed to cooperate with the locking lugs of a bolt 35C in slideC. That is, the pistol is of the locking type. Since the slide C moves axially with respect to barrel B the bolt 35C, in addition to moving axially with the slide has to rotate somewhat to enable its locking lugs to interact with those of the barrel B. The bolt is typically in the shape of an elongated cylinder with the lugs at one end thereof. Herebefore the bolt has been shaped with a cavity having a compound helical shape and extending through the center of the bolt. A pin is fixedly positioned in a direction transverse to the bolt s central axis. Although such an arrangement operates satisfactorily the bolt is undesirably weakened.In accordance with the present invention as shown in Fig. 7, a bolt 35C is provided which has a cavity 37C extending inwardly from the bolt s periphery. The cavity is shaped so that as the bolt 35C moves axially against a stationary pin a rotational motion is imparted to the bolt. By forming cavity 27C from the bolt periphery the bolt is much more reliable and has a much longer lifetime than prior art rotational bolts. The novel bolt can be thought of as a bolt with a peripherally extending cavity to impart to it a rotary motion as it moves linearly by a stationary pin, engaged in the cavity. As previously pointed out the trigger unit .can be easily removed. In accordance with another aspect of the present invention an adjustable two stage trigger unit is provided. Both length and pressure of the trigger pull can be adjusted to suit the needs of the individual marksman. Such a unit is shown in FigJ 8. Therein numerals 101 104 respectively, designate the unit housing, the spring for hammer, a hammer spring support, and a member forming part of the sever lever, which can pivot about 105. Numeral 106 designates a springXwhich is used to control the trigger pull pressure, while 107 designates a pin about which spring 106 is wound. Numeral 108 designates a nut like element against which one end of spring 106 presses, while 109 designates a pressure adjustment bolt.Numeral 110 designates the unit housing, while 112 designates a safety cover. An assembly pin 113 is also shown. The hammer post is designated by 115 and its pivot by 116. Finally, a trigger length control bar is shown as 117 and a trigger length bolt adjuster by 118. As seen, the heads of bolts 109 and 118 are accessible from the outside. By turning bolt 109 farther in more pressure of trigger pull is required to pull the sever lever to the right as shown . As to trigger length it is controlled by bolt 118. When bolt 118 is turned in and contact is formed between its tip and the sever lever element, the contact point being designated by 121, one length of the trigger pull is established. Otherwise a different length exists as a function of the contact point 122. Although particular embodiments of the invention have been described and illustrated herein, it is recognized that modifications and variations miy readily occur to those skilled in the art and consequently, it is intended that the claims be interpreted to cover such modifications and equivalents.
