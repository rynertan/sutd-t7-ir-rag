# Apparatus for transmitting information via telephone lines.

## Abstract
Voice band modems 4, 12 are used to transmit in formation via a loaded telephone line 2 when a telephone 1 connected to the line is on hook. When the telephone is off hook, the integrity of the line is checked by transmitting a pilot tone 6, 7 from the subscriber end to the central office end of the line, where the pilot tone is monitored 16, 31, 15 . Filtering of pilot tones in the central office is avoided by using two different pilot tones for originating and answered calls. An alarm condition at the subscriber produces a shift ed pilot tone frequency. Loss or a change in frequency of the monitored pilot tone causes a telephone call on the line to be temporarily interrupted 14, 35, 36, 37 for checking the line and alarm condition. The central office and equipment can be switched to poll consecutively a plurality of tele phone lines.
