# Process for manufacturing clad aluminium lithium alloys.

## Abstract
A metallurgical bond at the interface between an aluminium lithium core alloy and a metallic liner is achieved by first forming a mechanical bond along the interface between the core and liner, under moderated temperature and reduction conditions, and then heating the composite without simultaneous reduction to cause diffusion of the elements across the core liner interface. The resultant metal lurgical bond secures the layers together to form a compo site which can be worked, shaped and fabricated by normal reduction techniques.
