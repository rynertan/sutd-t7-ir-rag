# Method for manufacturing continuous coil slide fasteners.

## Abstract
Continuous method of manufacturing coil type slide fasteners by forming synthetic monofilaments into a pair of uncured fastener element coils. The fastener coils are then intermeshed in coupled relation and sewn onto the adjacent edges of a pair of uncured knit tapes. The coil, sewing thread and knit tapes are each composed of the same thermosetting resin. The fastener chain is advanced at uniform tension and velocity through a pressing stage 25 and viscous dye bath 30 containing a dispersion type thermosoling dye. The advancing chain is then vacuumed 40 to provide uniform deposition of the dye on the tape and coil. The chain is then dried 45 and led through a heating zone 50 maintained at a temperature which simultaneously fixes the dyestuffs and cures or thermosets the coil and knit tapes. Thereafter, the moving chain is washed 60 and calendered 65 while being maintained under tension. The continuous zipper chain is then cut to length and supplied with a slider and end stops 75 .
