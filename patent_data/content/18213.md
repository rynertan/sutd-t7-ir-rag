# Facsimile receiver or transceiver apparatus and method of operation.

## Abstract
In a facsimile receiver or transceiver, a copy medium 16 is advanced between a platen 14 of, preferably, triangular cross section and a plurality of stylii 22 moun ted on and electrically coupled to a conductive moving belt 12 . Platen 14 is rotatable by solenoid 26 to allow dif ferent apices 20 thereof to be placed in contact with copy medium 16 . Platen 14 is also rotatable to a position where a flat face thereof is juxtaposed to copy medium 16 to allow copy medium 16 to be fed between stylii 22 and platen 14 . Preferably stylii 22 are formed from sheet like members with a broad surface for contact with copy medium 16 . Suitably three such stylii 22 are mounted on a closed loop sheet metal belt 12 through which they are electrically energised as belt 12 moves. Stylii 22 are spaced such that one or another is always in contact with copy medium 16 .
