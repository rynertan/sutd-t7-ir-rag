# Fire protection system for aircraft.

## Abstract
An aircraft fire protection system includes a plurality of extinguishant bottles 19a 19g which can be detonated to deliver extinguishant into a manifold 22 and then to select ed fire zones 10 18 through valves 26, 30, 38, 40, 42 associated with the respective fire zones. Solid state control circuitry opens the appropriate valve when a corresponding push button switch 64, 66, 68, 82, 84 is initially depressed and detonates one or more bottles in sequence when the same switch is subsequently depressed one or more times. A manual crash switch 70 opens all valves when depress ed once and discharges all bottles when depressed again. An automatic crash switch 246 opens all valves and det onates all bottles if the aircraft should crash. A test circuit 60 operates in a test mode to open all valves in sequence and to simulate sequential detonation of all bottles by apply ing low level current to the bottle detonator circuits 232a 232g .
