# Wafer box.

## Abstract
A wafer box having a variable wafer slot size including a wafer box body of a rectangular parallelpiped shape having parallel wafer inserting grooves formed in inner side surfaces thereof extending in a vertical direction, a plurality of parallel fixing plate inserting grooves formed in the end surfaces and extending in a vertical direction, and an open upper part. At least one fixing plate, also having a plurality of wafer receiving grooves formed on at least one surface thereof, is inserted into a selected pair of the fixing plate inserting grooves. Both ends of the plate are shaped so as to be easily insertable and removable. Buffer members are placed between the side sur faces in the upper and lower portions of the box to support the wafers from the upper and lower sides thereof. A closure covers the upper part of the box.
