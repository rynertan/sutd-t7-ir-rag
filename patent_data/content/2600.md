# Check valve structure.

## Abstract
A check valve assembly has a conduit section with an inlet 12 and an outlet 14 on a longitudinal axis thereof, and first and second check valves in the conduit section. The check valves 30 50 respectively have first 32 and second 52 valve stems movable along a common axis inclined to the longitudinal axis, first 40 and second valve seats 60 and co operating valve plates 42 56 perpendicular to the common axis and mounted on the valve stems. The first check valve is upstream of the second check valve, and the second valve seat has a larger diameter than the first valve seat. The first and second valve seats have portions located between the inlet and the outlet, and the first valve plate has a lift sufficient to enable fluid flowing from the inlet to the outlet, when the valves are open, to flow past the portions of the valve seats in a substantially straight line from the inlet to the outlet. The conduit section has removable means for securing the check valves in position.
