## Description
The present invention relates to rubber reinforced polymers ofmonovinylidene aromatic compounds, particularly to rubber reinforcedpolymers having a unique balance of gloss and physical strengthproperties, and to a method for preparing the rubber reinforced polymerproducts. Rubber reinforced polymers comprising a continuous matrix phase ofa polymer of styrene having discrete particles of a cross linked rubber,e.g., polybutadiene, dispersed throughout the styrene polymer matrix conventionally referred to as high impact polystyrene or HIPS areemployed in a variety of commercial applications such as packaging,refrigerator linings, furniture, domestic appliances and toys. It is often desirable that the high impact polystyrene productsemployed in many of said commercial applications possess exceptionalgloss and or translucency properties while exhibiting at least a minimumphysical properties such as strength or toughness i.e., the combinationof elongation and impact strength . Specifically, it is desirable toprepare a high impact polystyrene which consistently exhibits a gloss of80 percent or more under various molding conditions while exhibiting atleast 2 to 3 times the notched impact strength of pure polystyrene.Heretofore, it has not been possible to prepare rubber reinforcedpolystyrene products having such a desired balance of properties. Specifically, German Patent Application 2,613,352 discloses aprocess for preparing a high impact polystyrene which is stated toexhibit improved transparency and mechanical properties whichsubstantially correspond to high impact polymers manufactured byconventional processes. The impact strength of these polymers isgenerally from 10 to 15 times the impact strength of polystyrene. Thehigh impact polystyrenes prepared by the disclosed process comprisedisperse rubber particles having a weight average diameter of less thanone µm, preferably from 0.2 to 0.6 µm. In the examples, theexemplified high impact polystyrenes are prepared having a particle sizegenerally of at least 0.3 to 0.5 µm. While these exemplifieddisclosed high impact polystyrene products exhibit relatively good physical strength properties, they do not always exhibit thedesired gloss. Alternatively, E.P. Application No. 0 069 792 discloses transparentimpact resistant, styrene containing polymers prepared having astyrene diene block copolymer dispersed throughout the polystyrenematrix in the form of rods or spheres having diameters of 0.07 µmor less. Although said transparent resins exhibit exceptional gloss whenmixed with colorants, the physical strengths, particularly impactstrengths, of the products are not sufficiently high for use of thepolystyrene products in many applications. An alternative method for preparing a high impact,rubber reinforced polystyrene consists of dispersing the rubberthroughout the continuous polystyrene matrix as particles having twodifferent sizes i.e., a bimodal particle size distribution . Ingeneral, these rubber reinforced products exhibit superior physicalproperties, particularly impact strengths, superior to those of arubber reinforced product containing a dispersed rubber phase of amonomodal particle size distribution. Unfortunately, these superiorphysical properties are achieved at the expense of the gloss propertiesof the rubber reinforced product. In view of the stated deficiencies in rubber reinforced polystyreneproducts known in the prior art, it remains highly desirable to providea rubber reinforced polystyrene containing rubber having improved glossproperties in combination with sufficient physical strength propertiesand to a method for preparing said rubber reinforced polystyreneproducts. Accordingly, in one aspect, the present invention is arubber reinforced polymer comprising a continuous phase of apolymer consisting essentially of units derived from one or morepolymerizable monovinylidene aromatic compounds having discreteparticles dispersed throughout the polymer matrix, wherein thediscrete rubber particles are formed in a mass polymerizationprocess, have a shell core morphology and have a volume averageparticle size from more than 0.1 to 0.19 µm. By controlling the size of the rubber particles suchthat their volume average particle size is from more than 0.1 to 0.19 µm,the rubber reinforced product exhibits an unexpectedly surprising balance of gloss and physical strength properties. Specifically, a gloss of 80percent or greater is exhibited by the rubber reinforced product over awide range of molding conditions. Moreover, the notched impact strengthcommonly exceeds the impact strength of pure polystyrene by 2 to 3 timesand the elongation at break of the product is at least 5, often 10 to 15times the elongation at break of pure polystyrene. In another aspect, the present invention is a method for preparingthe described rubber reinforced polymer product. The method comprisesthe steps of mass polymerizing a solution of one or more polymerizablemonovinylidene aromatic compounds and a rubber at conditions suchthat upon the phase inversion of the mass polymerization mixtureand the subsequent sizing of the rubber the rubber is formed asparticles of a shell core morphology having a volume average particlesize of from more than 0.1 to 0.19 µm, wherein these conditions are achievedby bonding sufficient blocks of monovinylidene aromatic polymerto the alkadiene rubber either prior to or simultaneously withthe mass polymerization step and by the appropriate modificationof the polymerization mixture matching the viscosity of the rubberphase and the viscosity of the continuous phase at phase inversion,subsequently completing the polymerization using either mass orsuspension polymerization techniques and thereafter subjectingthe polymerization mixture to conditions sufficient to removethe unreacted monomers and to cross link the polymerized alkadieneof the shell core rubber particles. This small particle size is achieved by bonding sufficient blocksof an aromatic polymer to the butadiene in the rubber either prior to orsimultaneously with the mass polymerization step and by the modificationof the polymerization mixture, e.g., matching the viscosity of therubber phase and the viscosity of the continuous matrix phase at phaseinversion. Specifically, the ratio of the viscosities of the two phasescan be adjusted by varying the molecular weight of the polymer of themonovinylidene aromatic compound s during the initial phases ofpolymerization, with sufficiently high molecular weight being desiredsuch that upon phase inversion and subsequent sizing of the rubber, therubber is readily dispersed throughout the continuous matrix phase asdiscrete particles having a desirably small particle size. Following phase inversion and the sizing of the rubber particles,polymerization is completed, using either mass or suspensionpolymerization techniques, and the polymerization mixture subjected toconditions sufficient to remove the unreacted monomers and to cross linkthe rubber. Specifically, using mass polymerization techniques,subsequent to obtaining the desired conversion, the polymerizationmixture is subjected to conditions sufficient to remove the unreactedmonomers and to cross link the rubber of a shell core morphology. Due to their excellent balance of physical properties, therubber reinforced polymers of the present invention are useful in a widevariety of applications, particularly the injection molding of smallhousehold appliances such as hair dryers, toys and furniture. Therubber reinforced polymers are also useful in extrusion applicationssuch as the preparation of a gloss layer using coextrusion techniques. The rubber reinforced polymers of the present invention are derivedfrom one or more monovinylidene aromatic compounds. Representativemonovinylidene aromatic compounds include styrene, alkyl substitutedstyrenes such as α alkyl styrenes e.g., α methylstyrene and α ethylstyrene and ring substituted styrenes e.g., vinyl toluene, particularly The rubber employed in preparing the rubber reinforced polymers ofthe present invention is generally a homopolymer or copolymer of analkadiene having a second order transition temperature of not greaterthan 0 Although homopolymers of the stated conjugated dienes can beemployed, the rubbery component of the mass polymerization mixture atphase inversion will comprise a relatively high amount of a polymer of amonovinylidene aromatic compound being chemically bonded in blocks or asgrafted branches to the alkadiene polymer. Therefore, a copolymer of aconjugated diene with a monovinylidene aromatic compound such as styreneis often preferred for use as the rubber in the practice of the presentinvention. Preferred of such copolymers are block or graft copolymers comprising at least about 55, more preferably from 65 to 85 weightpercent, in polymerized form, of the alkadiene, preferably 1,3 butadieneand up to 45, more preferably from 15 to 35, weight percent, inpolymerized form, of a monovinylidene aromatic compound, preferablystyrene. The preferred copolymers are block copolymers of amonovinylidene aromatic compound and a conjugated diene of the AB BA The rubber is advantageously employed in an amount such that therubber reinforced polymer product contains sufficient amounts of thepolymerized alkadiene such that the resulting product exhibits a desiredbalance of gloss and physical strength properties. Specifically, as theamounts of the polymerized alkadiene in the rubber reinforcedpolystyrene product increase, the physical strength also increases witha coincident loss in gloss properties. Although the amounts ofpolymerized alkadiene are therefore dependent on the desired propertiesof the rubber reinforced polymer product, in general, therubber reinforced polymer product contains from 3 to 25 weight percentof polymerized alkadiene, with from 5 to 15 weight percent ofpolymerized alkadiene, based on the total weight of therubber reinforced polymer, being preferred. In the rubber reinforced polymer of the present invention, therubber is dispersed throughout the polystyrene matrix as discreteparticles having a monomodal size distribution with a volume averageparticle size from more than 0.1 to 0.19 µm and a shell core type morphology.Preferably, the rubber has a volume average particle size from0.15 to 0.19 µm. The indicated particlesize diameter is the diameter of the particles, including allocclusions present in the disperse rubber particles of therubber reinforced polymer and is measured using conventional techniquessuch as electron microscopy techniques. In the practice of the present invention, the rubber reinforcedpolymer is prepared by solubilizing the desired amount of rubber in themonovinylidene aromatic compound s and mass polymerizing the resultingsolution at conditions sufficient to form rubber particles having the desired particle size and morphology dispersed throughout thepolymerized monovinylidene aromatic compound. In general, continuousmethods for mass polymerizing the monovinylidene aromatic compound inthe monomer rubber solution are advantageously employed. The polymerization is preferably conducted in one or moresubstantially linear stratified flow or so called plug flow typereactors such as described in U.S. Patent No. 2,727,884, which may ormay not comprise recirculation of a portion of the partially polymerizedproduct. In general, in mass polymerization processes using a plug flowtype reactor, upon initial formation of polymer the initially presentpolymer comes out of solution and forms a discontinuous phase comprisingpolymer dissolved in monomer dispersed throughout a continuous phase ofthe rubber monomer solution. Eventually, sufficient amounts of themonomer are polymerized and the discontinuous phase becomes a continuousphase with the rubber forming a discontinuous phase dispersedtherethrough. This phenomenon is referred to as phase inversion whichterm means generally the conversion of the monovinylidene aromaticpolymer from a discontinuous phase dispersed in a continuous phase ofthe rubber through the point where there is no distinct continuous ordiscontinuous phase in the polymerization mixture to a continuouspolymer phase having the rubber dispersed therethrough. The particle size and morphology of the rubber in the finalrubber reinforced product are dependent, to a significant extent, on thecharacteristics of the polymerization mixture at phase inversion andshortly thereafter, particularly, the amounts and molecular weight ofpolymerized monovinylidene aromatic compound chemically bound to thepolymerized alkadiene of the rubber and the viscosities of themonovinylidene aromatic copolymer phase and rubbery component phase atphase inversion. The general manner by which these polymerizationcharacteristics affect the rubber particle size and the morphology ofthe rubber particles is illustrated in an article entitled Teilchenbildung bei der Herstellung von KautschukmodifiziertemPolystyrol by Adolf Echte, Die Angewandte Makromolekulare Chemie 58 59 1977 pps 175 198. In this article a review is given of various typesof particles. From measurements of the electromicrographs providedtherein it can be concluded that the particles have sizes of 0.21 µmand more. In general, to achieve the desired morphology, the amount ofmonovinylidene aromatic polymer bonded to the polymerized alkadiene at or near phase inversion which bonded monovinylidene aromatic polymerincludes the monovinylidene aromatic polymer originally present in therubber as a block or graft and the amounts of monovinylidene aromaticpolymer subsequently grafted to the polymerized alkadiene during thepolymerization process is at least 30 percent, by weight, based on thetotal weight of the polymerized alkadiene and the bound polymerizedmonovinylidene aromatic compound. Although any suitable method can beemployed to measure the amounts of this bound polymer in or grafted onthe rubber particles at phase inversion, the amounts of the boundpolymer are readily measured by extracting a sample of thepolymerization mixture at phase inversion and subsequently determiningthe monovinylidene aromatic polymer bound to the polymerized alkadieneusing selective extraction techniques e.g., first extracting the freepolystyrene with a mixture of methyl ethyl ketone and acetone and thendestroying the rubber backbone of the residual material using OsO The rubber initially employed in the preparation of therubber reinforced product can contain these amounts of bound,monovinylidene aromatic polymer. In this case, it is not necessary tograft additional amounts of monovinylidene aromatic to the polymerizedalkadiene although such additional grafting is generally preferred.Therefore, thermal polymerization i.e., polymerization using no graftpromoting initiator , during which little grafting occurs, can beconducted to form the desired particles of rubber. However, in general,it is necessary and or desirable to graft amounts of the monovinylidenearomatic polymer to the polymerized alkadiene during the initial stageof polymerization in excess of those obtainable using conventionalthermal polymerization techniques. In such case, an initiator capable of initiating the polymerization of the monovinylidene aromatic compound s and of grafting the polymer to the rubber is employed. Initiatorsadvantageously employed herein are generally free radical typeinitiators. Representative of such initiators include the peroxideinitiators such as the peresters, e.g., tertiarybutyl peroxybenzoate andtertiarybutyl peroxyacetate dibenzoyl peroxide dilauroyl peroxide 1,1 bistertiarybutyl peroxycyclohexane 1,3 bistertiarybutylperoxy 3,3,5 trimethylcyclohexane dicumylperoxide and photochemicalinitiators. Although the efficiency of an initiator inpromoting the polymer grafting and the initiation of polymerization isdependent on the temperature of polymerization, and the concentrationsof the initiator and the rubber, the preferred initiators are generallydibenzoyl peroxide, tertiarybutyl peroxybenzoate, 1,1 bistertiarybutylperoxycyclohexane and tertiarybutyl peroxyacetate. The concentration at which the initiator is most advantageouslyemployed is dependent on the specific initiator employed, the desiredlevels of grafting and the conditions at which the mass polymerizationis conducted. In general, in the preferred process for preparingrubber reinforced polymers wherein the polymerization is conducted inone or more substantially linear flow or plug flow type reactors, from50 to 2000, preferably from 100 to 1000, weight parts of initiator areemployed per million parts of the aromatic monomer. The particle size of the disperse rubber particles depends on theshearing i.e., shearing stress and shear rate during phase inversionand subsequent thereto until stabilization of the rubber particles thegreater the amount of shear, the lower the particle size. A generaldescription of the effect of shearing on particle size is found in U.S,Patent 3,243,481 and in Freeguard, British Polymer Journal 6 1974 , pps205 228. The shearing of the polymerization mixture can be achieved byany conventional manner such as by appropriate stirring devices. In the practice of the present invention, the shear is maintainedsuch that the rubber particles in the rubber reinforced product exhibita volume average particle size from more than 0.1 0.19 µm. The shear and orstirring required to achieve this particle size depends on theparticular equipment employed and the characteristics of the polymerization mixture and can be established by those skilled in theart using simple experimentation. To obtain the desirably small rubber particles using the lowestshear rates, it is advantageous to match the viscosities of the rubbercontaining phase and monovinylidene aromatic polymer phase at phaseinversion. Specifically, it is generally advantageous to adjust themolecular weight of the monovinylidene aromatic polymer so as to adjustthe viscosity of the polymeric phase in relation to the viscosity of therubber phase, e.g., by increasing the molecular weight of themonovinylidene aromatic polymer, thereby increasing the viscosity of thepolymeric phase to more closely match this viscosity with that of therubber phase at phase inversion. Although the use of an initiator will influence the molecularweight of the monovinylidene aromatic polymer, to obtain a polymerexhibiting a desirable molecular weight it is often necessary to modifyone or more other polymerization conditions. For example, the amount andtype of chain transfer agent, if any, employed prior to phase inversionaffects the molecular weight of the resulting monovinylidene aromaticpolymer. For example, increases in molecular weight are obtained byreducing the concentration of the chain transfer agent in thepolymerization system. Therefore, in many operations, polymerization isadvantageously conducted employing a sufficiently low concentration of achain transfer agent such that a polymer of a desirably high molecularweight can be prepared. Advantageously, the initial rubber monomersolution contains no chain transfer agent and any chain transfer agentis added only after phase inversion or, if added prior to phaseinversion, only after sufficient amounts of the monomer have beenpolymerized. Preferably, the polymerization mixture contains no chaintransfer agent prior to phase inversion. A difunctional polymerization initiator, e.g., a diperoxide, can beemployed in combination with or as the graft promoting polymerizationinitiator to increase the molecular weight of the monovinylidenearomatic polymer. In addition, an increase in the molecular weight ofthe monovinylidene aromatic polymer can be achieved by reducing thetemperatures of polymerization while maintaining the otherpolymerization conditions constant, e.g., same concentration andactivity of polymerization initiator. Since the conditions at which polymerization is conducted areinterrelated, one modification to the polymerization reaction will oftenrequire one or more other modifications to obtain the desiredrubber reinforced product. For example, when the polymerizationtemperatures prior to phase inversion are reduced so as to increase themolecular weight of the aromatic polymer, it is generally necessary touse higher polymerization temperatures following phase inversion toachieve the desired amounts of conversion. These interrelationships inthe polymerization conditions and the required modifications in theconditions of polymerization to obtain a desirable product are wellknown to the skilled artisan and can be determined using simple,experimental techniques. In addition to the monomer, rubber and initiator, the masspolymerization mixture optionally, but advantageously, contains anorganic liquid reaction diluent. Reaction diluents advantageouslyemployed herein include normally liquid organic materials which form asolution with polymerizable monomers and the polymer prepared therefromand which do not boil at the polymerization conditions employed.Representative organic liquid diluents include aromatic and inertlysubstituted aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, benzene,ethylbenzene and xylene saturated or inertly substituted,saturated aliphatics having either straight or branched chains of 5 ormore carbon atoms such as heptane, hexane or octane alicyclicor inertly substituted alicyclic hydrocarbons having 5 or 6 carbon atomssuch as cyclohexane. Preferred of such organic liquiddiluents are the inertly substituted aromatics with ethylbenzene andxylene being the most preferred. In general, the reaction diluent isemployed in amounts sufficient to improve reaction and viscosity controlof the polymerization mixture. Such amounts will vary depending on therubber, monomer and diluent employed the process equipment and thedesired degree of polymerization. In addition, some diluents such asethylbenzene act, to a limited extent, as a chain transfer agent andthis effect must be considered in determining the amounts employed. Ingeneral, if employed, the reaction diluent is normally employed at aconcentration from 2 to 30 weight percent based on the total weight ofthe rubber, monomer and diluent. In general, a plasticizer or lubricant is also often advantageouslyemployed in the preparation of the rubber reinforced polymers. Theplasticizer or lubricant affects the properties of the rubber reinforcedpolymer product, e.g., flow and heat resistant properties, and the typeand amounts of the plasticizer most advantageously employed are selectedaccordingly. Representative plastizicers or lubricants includebutylstearate, mineral oil or dioctylphthalate. Mineral oil is the mostpreferred plasticizer. The plasticizer is advantageously employed inconcentrations of up to 15 percent, preferably from 1 to 8, morepreferably from 1 to 7 weight percent based on the total weight of therubber reinforced polymer product. The plasticizer can be added at anyintermediate stage of polymerization or with the feed stream of themonomer rubber solution. In addition, the mass polymerization mixture may advantageouslycontain additional materials such as an antioxidant e.g., an alkylatedphenol such as di tert butyl p cresol or phosphites such as tris nonylphenylphosphite or a mold release agent, e.g., zinc stearate. Themold release agent, if employed, is preferably added only after phaseinversion. The temperatures at which the polymerization is most advantageouslyconducted are dependent on the specific components, particularly theinitiator, employed and will generally vary from 60 As an alternative to a continuous mass polymerization process toobtain the desired rubber reinforced product, a combination of mass andsuspension polymerization techniques can be employed. Using saidtechniques, the polymerization mixture is polymerized in mass untilphase inversion and subsequent size stabilization of the particles. Thepartially polymerized product can then be suspended with or withoutadditional monomer in an aqueous medium which contains a polymerizationinitiator and the polymerization subsequently completed. Therubber reinforced copolymer is subsequently separated from the aqueousmedium by acidification, centrifugation or filtration. The recoveredproduct is then washed with water and dried. The following examples are set forth to further illustrate the advantagesof the present invention as claimed.In the examples, all parts and percentages are by weight unlessotherwise indicated. A rubber reinforced polymer of styrene comprising a polystyrenematrix having rubber of a shell core type morphology is prepared usingseveral plug flow type reactors essentially as described in U.S.PatentNo. 2,727,884. The reactors are connected in series and each reactor isequipped with a variable speed agitator and heating and cooling means.To the top of the first reactor is continuously added a solutioncomprising 10 percent of a block copolymer rubber of 30 percentpolystyrene and 70 percent polybutadiene, 8 percent ethylbenzene, 1.6percent refined mineral oil, 0.02 percent of tertiarybutylperoxybenzoate, a graft promoting initiator and the balancestyrene. The polymerzation temperatures are controlled from 115 to 175 A rubber reinforced polystyrene product is prepared using thetechniques described in preparing Sample No. 1 except that 0.02 percentof a chain transfer agent is added to the stream when the amount of thestyrene monomer converted to polymer is 36 percent.

This general purpose polystyrene isdesignated Sample No. A. A rubber reinforced polystyrene is prepared using the techniquesdescribed in Example No. 1 except that a homopolymer of 1,3 butadiene Buna A rubber reinforced polystyrene is prepared using the techniquesdescribed in Example No. 1 except that the initial monomer rubber solution contained 0.1 percent of a chain transfer agent and only 0.012percent of the tert butylperoxybenzoate initiator which, at the otherpolymerization conditions employed, did not give the desired rubberparticle size. Specifically, due to the presence of the chain transferagent in the feed, the viscosity of the polymeric phase at phaseinversion was not sufficiently high to allow the formation of thedesirably small rubber particles. The rubber reinforced polystyrene thusprepared is designated Sample No. C. A rubber reinforced polystyrene is prepared by the techniques ofE.P. Application, Publication No. 0 069 792.

The results are set forth inthe accompanying Table. As evidenced by the data in the foregoing Table, therubber reinforced polystyrene products of the present invention whereinthe disperse rubber particles have a volume average particle size offrom more than 0.1 to 0.19 µm and a shell core morphology, exhibit anexceptional and unique balance of gloss and physical strength properties.
