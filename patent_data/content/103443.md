# Process for fabricating an optical device.

## Abstract
This invention is a process for fabricating optical devices by photoetching geometrical shapes on the surface of an n type or intrinsic compound semiconductor so as to yield sur faces of optical quality without further processing. The etching process is an electrochemical process where etching is pro portional to light intensity. The process involves applying a potential to the compound semiconductor while immersed in an electrolytic solution containing hydrofluoric acid and ir radiating the surface to be etched with light in a certain energy range. The distribution of light intensity and ray direction is selected to produce the desired geometrical shape. Particularly advantageous is that the surfaces produced are of optical quality. For example, lenses produced by the etching process exhibit surfaces of optical quality. Further, the process can be carried out on all the lenses on a wafer simultaneously without attention to individual devices. This is highly desirable eco nomically. Also, the lenses produced are integral parts of the light emitting diode.
