# A sound diffusion plant with very low directivity.

## Abstract
The plant, normally of the multiway type, is essentially characterized by the fact that each way comprises a pair of loudspeakers arranged one opposite the other, the dia phragms of which are enclosed in a space delimitated by screening elements made of high acoustic absorption mater ial. The said plant enables the sound diffusion to be uniform in the surrounding space and makes it possible to limit greatly undesired effects, such as for example, sound haloes and identical sounds reproduced by different ways being out of phase.
