## Description
The present invention relates to a process for preparation of sintered silicon nitride. More particularly, the present invention relates to a process for preparing a sintered silicon nitride having an improved strength and uniformity in quality. The sintered silicon nitride has hithereto attracted the attention of the industrial circles concerned as one of new engineering ceramics for use as a high temperature structural member. Silicon nitride is, however, a compound in which the atoms tend to be bonded together by covalent bonding, and thus it is difficult to sinter as it is. Then, compounds of low melting point are generally adoed to silicon nitride to improve the sintering property, EP A1 100 380 discloses a sintered compact composed of at least 50 by weight of silicon nitride and less than 50 by weight of additives selected from AlN, Al₂O₃, Y₂O₃, YN, WC, MO₂C, Mg₃N₂, CaO, Ca₃N₂, ZrO₂, TiO₂, HfO₂, FeO, SiC, CeO₂, BeO₂, Be₃N₂, TiN and Al. Japanese patent publication No. A 59 190 274 discloses a sintered body composed of 1 25 by volume of zirconium oxide, 1 15 by weight of one or more than one elements of IVa, Va and VIa groups, 0.5 10 by weight of more than of Al, Y, Mg and lanthanides, and a balance of silicon nitride, EP A1 79 678 discloses that a sintering additive composed of at least one metal oxide selected from a group of oxides of Li, Mg, Al, Ca, Ti, Y, Zr, Ba and Ce is added to a powder of silicon nitride to produce a sintered body of silicon nitride. However, in the prior art, as mentioned above for preparing sintered silicon nitride, each component of the sintering agent is separately added to and mixed with the powder of silicon nitride. It is also known to use as a sintering agent the powder which is abraded from the ball mill. Even if the mixing of the sintering agent with the powder of silicon nitride is conducted for a long time, however, a uniform mixing or dispersion of the sintering agent cannot be attained by means of any of the prior art methods described above, so that defect would be formed in the resulting product and the scattering results be observed with respect to the mechanical properties thereof. Particularly, it is often necessary to use more than two kinds of sintering agents in order to enhance the sintering property. Accordingly, it becomes all the more difficult to attain a uniform dispersion of the sintering agents in the powder of silicon nitride. It is an object of the present invention to overcome the problems of the prior art described above and to provide a process for preparation of a sintered silicon nitrite which presents high uniformity in quality and can be put into a practical use as an engineering ceramic. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a process for preparation of a sintered silicon nitride, by means of which a uniform dispersion of the sintering agents can be attained so that a sintered silicon nitride can be prepared having a high uniformity in strength and quality. It is a still further object of the present invention to provide a process for preparing a sintered silicon nitride presenting at the same time a high strength, a high abrasive resistance and a high uniformity in quality. According to the present invention, there is provided a process for preparing a sintered silicon nitride comprising the steps defined in claim 1. The co precipitated powder preferably includes oxide and or hydroxide of metals such as Mg, Al, Sc, Y. La Ti, Zr and Hf. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the sintering agent is mixed in an amount of 1.0 to 50 wt calculated in terms of the oxide contained therein on the basis of the total weight of the resulting sintered silicon nitride. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the co precipitated powder indudes ZrO₂ and oxide of at least one element selected from the group consisting of Y and LA. The content of ZrO₂ is preferably 1 to 25 vol on the basis of the total volume of the sintered silioon nitride and the content of the oxide of Y or La is 0,5 to 10 wt calculated in terms of the amount of the element on the basis of the total weight of the sintered silicon nitride. According to a further preferred embodiment of the present invention, ZrO₂ is cubic cystal which has been stabilized with CaO, MgO or Y₂O₃. According to the still further preferred embodiment of the present invention, hydroxides of Zr and Y are co precipitated and the co precipitate is then burned to provide a powder of cubic ZrO₂ stabilized with Y₂O₃, which is preferably usable as a sintering agent. It is further preferable to add 1 to 15 wt of at least one element selected from the group consisting of the elements of IVa except Zr , Va and VIa groups of the Periodic Table. The element selected from 4A a except Zr , 5a and 6a groups of the Periodic Table may be added to the mixture in the form of anyone of carbide, nitride, carbonitride, oxide and the mutual solid solution thereof or in the co precipitated form with oxide or hydroxide of Zr and Y or lanthanide. Other and further objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be more clearly understood from the following description. In view of attaining the above object of the present invention, we conducted experiments and researches on the mixing method of the sintering agents, and found that the above objects are effectively attained by using a powder of sintering agents which has been obtained by co precipitation. That is, the main feature of the present invention resides in that the powder of sintering agent includes a powder mixture of oxides and or hydroxides of two kinds of metals which has been prepared by co precipitation. The metal oxides and or hydroxides usable as main sintering agent in the process according to the present invention include, for example, oxides and or hydroxides of Mg, Sc, Y, La, Ti, Zr, Hf. These metal oxides and or hydroxides are prepared by co precipitation. Such a co precipitation of metal oxides and or hydroxides comprises the steps of The thus obtained precipitates are generally composed of a uniform mixture of metal hydroxides which can be converted to metal oxides by thermal decomposition. Further it is possible to obtain n co precipitate containing oxides and or hydroxides at any desired ratio. The process according to the present invention is conducted by following the main three steps, that is, the formulating step, compacting step and sintering step. In the formulating step, the powder of sintering agents obtained by oo precipitation is mixed in a predetermined amount with a powder of silicon nitride. In the compacting step, the obtained mixture of the sintering agents and silicon nitride is compacted into a piece having a predetermined shape and size by means of die forming, rubber press forming, extrusion forming, projection forming or mold forming. The thus obtained compact is then sintered under a non oxidizing atmosphere by, for example, the normal pressure sintering, hot pressing or high temperature hydrostatic pressing HIP . The atmospheric gas under which the sintering is conducted includes N₂ and the rare gas such as Ar, among which N₂ is the most preferable because of economical reason. Now, the reasons for defining the conditions of the process according to the present invention will be explained. Non oxide ceramics such as silicon nitride are generally bonded by covalent bonding and thus the sintering property thereof is low. Due to the low sintering property, it is necessary to add several kinds of sintering agents to heighten the sintering property. In such a case, it is very important to disperse the sintering agents uniformly in the powder of silicon nitride. This uniformity of dispersion gives a large influence on the physical properties of the resulting sintered product. Thus, it is essential to obtain a uniform dispersion in order to provide a practically usable sintered silicon nitride. We found that, when sintering agents are co precipitated from a solution, n powder of the sintering agents uniformly mixed with and dispersed in each other can be obtained with a particle size smaller than 2 µm. Use of such uniformly mixed powders can improve remarkedly the strength and uniformity in physical properties of the resulting sintered product. We consider that because the powder obtained by co precipitation contains several kinds of metal elements uniformly dispersed therein, the resulting sintered product prepared therefrom maintains the aimed chemical composition at any site thereof. If a plurality of sintering agents are added to the powder of silicon nitride powder and thus the liquid phase is not formed uniformly in the course of the sintering thereof, thereby causing microscopic defects and resulting in scattering qualities of the sintered product. Such defects can be cured according to the present invention. According to the present invention, the amount of the sintering agent is preferably from 1.0 to 50 wt of the total amount of the sintered silicon nitride. With the sintering agent in an amount outside the above range, desirable physical properties cannot be obtained. The effect of each sintering agent used according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention will be explained. ZrO₂ tends to react with Y₂O₃ and or oxide of La to enhance the sintering property to thereby heighten the density of the sintered silicon nitride. Namely, ZrO₂ reacts with Y₂O₃ and or the oxide of La form an amorphous material such as ZrYON in the grain boundary of silicon nitride which amorphous material bonds strongly the silicon nitride grains to thereby heighten the density of the sintered silicon nitride. Further ZrO₂ is partially precipitated in the grain boundary of silicon nitride to improve the fracture toughness of the sintered silicon nitride. Carbides, nitrides, carbonitrides or oxides of the elements of the 4A except Zr , 5A and 6A groups of the Periodic Table are effective for improving the sintering property and at the same time preventing abnormal grain growth of silicon nitride to thereby provide a sintered material composed of fine and uniform grain. In more detail, whithout the addition of these compound, the sintering agents of Y₂C₃ and ZrO₂ tend to react with SiO₂ to form a liquid phase, in which silicon nitride is resolved in the course of the sintering. Thus the sintering proceeds while silicon nitride is recrystallized from the liquid phase, which is inevitably accompanied with the grain growth of silicon nitride. The compounds of the elements of the IVa except Zr , Va and VIa groups of the Periodic Table end, however, to be diffused in the liquid phase to suppress the grain growth of the precipitated silicon nitride. Further these carbides, nitrides, carbonitrides and oxides of the elements of IVa except Zr . Va and VIa groups of the Periodic Table themselves present a high hardness and are stable at high temperatures, and therefore they are effective to provide a sintered product being excellent in mechanical and thermal properties. That is, silicon nitride has generally a low hardness and a low abrasive resistance because Si has a high affinity with Fe and presents a low hardness. To the contrary, the carbides, nitrides, carbonitrides and oxides of the element of 4A except Zr 5A and 6A groups of the Periodic Table have a low affinity with Fe and present a high hardness, so that they are effective for improving the abrasive resistance of the cutting tool made from the sintered silicon nitride. The addition of these carbides, nitrides, carbonitrides or oxides together with the co precipitated powder of Y₂O₃ and ZrO₂ enables to obtain a sintered material having a high hardness and therefore a high abrasive resistance which can not be attained only with the addition of Y₂O₃ and ZrO₂. These elements of 4A except Zr , 5A and 6A groups of the Periodic Table may be contained in the sintered silicon nitride in any form of carbide, nitride, carbonitride, oxide, mutual solid solution and admixture thereof and the adding effect thereof is the same in any form. Oxides and or hydroxides of these elements, however, are preferably added in the co precipitated form with ZrO₂ and Y₂O. For this sake, an aqueous solution is prepared containing Zr, Y and an element of 4A except Zr 5A and 6A groups of the Periodic Table, and then the co precipitation may be conducted to obtain a co precipitate of the hydroxides of the elements. The co precipitate of the hydroxides may be further thermally decomposed into oxides. If the resulting sintered product contains ZrO₂ in an amount lower than 1 vol , the effect of the addition thereof is not significant. On the other hand, wiht ZrO₂ in an amount higher than 25 vol , the content of silicon nitride in the resulting sintered silicon nitride becomes proportionally less so that the mechanical strength and the hardness of the resulting sintered silicon nitride are abruptly lowered and, as explained in detail hereinafter, the grain growth is observed with a result that the mechanical strength and the abrasive resistance are further lowered. Accordingly, the content of ZrO₂ should be in the range of 1 to 25 vol . The content of Y₂O₃ and oxide of La are defined in terms of the weight percent of these elements contained in the resulting sintered silicon nitride. If the amount of these elements is lower than 0.5 wt , the adding effect is not significant, while the addition of these elements in an amount higher than 10 wt lowers the high temperature strength and makes the microscopic structure of the resulting silicon nitride coarser with a result that the mechanical strenght and the abrasive resistance are lowered. Accordingly, Y or La should be added in an amount of 0.5 to 10 wt in the form of oxide or hydroxide. The adding amount of carbide, nitride, carbonitride, oxide or mutual solid solution of the element of 4A except Zr , 5A and 6A groups of the Periodic Table is defined in terms of the amount of these elements on the basis of the total weight of the sintered material. If the content of these element in the sintered material is lower than 1 wt , a significant adding effect is not obtained. The addition of these elements of higher than 15 wt adversely affects the sintering property. Accordingly, the content of the elements belonging to 4A except Zr , 5A and 6A groups of the Periodic Table should be in the range of 1 to 15 wt of the sintered material. According to an embodiment of the present invention, ZrO₂ is cubic crystal stabilized by CaO, MgO or Y₂O₃. ZrO₂ has three kinds of polymorphes, that is, monoclinic ZrO₂ m.ZrO₂ , tetragonal ZrO₂ t ZrO₂ and cubic ZrO₂ c ZrO₂ . While m ZrO₂ is slable up to about 1100 C, it transforms to t ZrO₂ over 1100 C and to c ZrO₂ over 2370 C. These phase transformations occur in reverse direction by cooling. Among them, it should be noted that the phase transformation between m ZrO₂ and t ZrO₂ is accompanied with a change in volume as large as 4 . According to an embodiment of the present invention, stabilized c ZrO₂ is used as a sintering agent to prevent the phase transformation of ZrO₂ for improving the heat resistance, ZrO₂ can be stabilized, for example, by adding to ZrO₂, Y₂O₃ in an amount of about 11 mol and heating the mixture to higher than 1200 C. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, hydroxides of yttrium and zirconium are co precipitated and then heated to higher than 1200 C to convert the hydroxides to oxides and stabilize ZrO₂ as c ZrO₂. According to the result of the experiments conducted by the present inventors, the mechanical strength and the abrasive resistance of the sintered silicon nitride are affected by the grain size of silioon nitride. With a larger grain size, the mechanical strength and the abrasive resistance become lowered. If the grain size is larger than 3 microns, the sintered material is degraded in these properties. On the other hand, the sintering agent is easily made to have a mean particle size smaller than 2 microns by co precipitation. The mixture of silicon nitride and the sintering agent is compacted and sintered in non oxidizing atmosphere such as nitrogen under high or normal pressure. The hot pressing may be preferably conducted under a pressure higher than 4.9 MPa 50kg cm² and at a temperature of 1600 to 1900 C, preferably of 1700 to 1800 C to thereby obtain silioon nitride of β phase, because silicon nitride transforms to β phase at about 1700 C0. The identification of the β phase of silicon nitride can be made by X ray diffraction. The pressure in the nitrogen atmosphere may be a minimum value as far as the decomposition of silicon nitride can be suppressed thereunder. For example, the nitrogen atmosphere may be maintained under 0,98 bar 1 atm. at a sintering temperature of 1700 C, and 10 atm, at a sintering temperature of 1800 C. Further, for degassing the green compact, it may be headed under vacuum up to a temperature at which silicon nitride is not decomposed. The present invention will be explained in more detail by way of Examples which illustrates the present invention only for representing the effect of the present invention. Thus, the example should not be construed to restrict the scope of the invention. Solutions of chlorides of Al and Y were mixed at a molecular ratio 1 1 and then ammonia was added to the resulting mixture to thereby co precipitate aluminum hydroxide and yttrium hydroxide. The thus obtained co precipitated was burned at 1000 C in atmosphere to obtain a powder mixture of aluminum oxide and yttrium oxide. The powder mixture was added in the amount shown in Table 1 to a powder of silicon nitride of α type having a particle size of 0.6 microns, and mixed and ground by a ball mill. The mixed and ground powder was compacted and the obtained compact was then sintered at 1750 C for 2 hours under a nitrogen atmosphere of 4 bars, to thereby obtain specimen Nos. 1 to 6, For comparison, powders of Al₂O₃, and Y₂O, were mixed with the same powder of silicon nitride by means of a ball mill so as to obtain a powder mixture having the same chemical composition as the corresponding one of specimen Nos. 1 to 6. The obtained powder mixture was sintered under the same condition as the above to thereby provide specimen Nos. 11 to 16. Specimens were cutted from each of the obtained sintered materials. For each specimen, the bending strength and Weibull modulus for 20 specimens were determined, of which the results are described in Table I. In the exemples listed in Table I, specimen Nos. 11 to 16 correspond respectively to specimen Nos. 1 to 6 with respect to the content of the sintering agent Specimen Nos. 1 and 5 are control example becausse the content of the sintering agent falls outside the range according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. As readily understood from the result shown in Table I, when Y₂O₃ and Al₂O₃ were added at an equal molecular ratio and in a total amount ranging from 1.0 to 50 wt , a remarkable improvement in physical properties can be attained. In more detail, specimen Nos. 2 to 4 and 6 present excellent physical properties such as relative density, bending strength and Weibull modulus, as compared with other specimens. Specimen Nos. 1 and 5 are degraded with respect to bending strength, because the content of the sintering agent is out of the range according to the preferred embodiment of the invention. Accordingly, it will be understood that use of the co precipitated sintering agent is very effective for the improvement in the mechanical properties. By using a variety of co precipitated powders shown in Table II, specimen Nos. 21 to 25 were produced under the same condition as Example 1. The mechanical properties of the obtained sintered products were determined and the results are shown also in Table II. For comparison, specimen Nos. 31 to 35 were also produced by using the same oxides in the same amount as the corresponding one of specimen Nos. 21 to 25, except that the oxides had not been subjected to co precipitation. The mechanical properties of these specimens are also shown in Table II. As reasily understood from Table II, use of co precipitated and burned powder including ZrO₂, MgO La₂O₃, HfO₂ is effective in improving the physical properties of the sintered product as Al₂O₃ and Y₂O₃ Example 1 . Further, we produced sintered silicon nitride by using the co precipitated powder of metal hydroxides without burning the same. We confirmed that a similar improvement in mechanical properties can be attained by using the as co precipitated powder of hydroxides. By using 7.25 wt of co precipitated powders each containing Al₂O₃ and Y₂O₃ in a molecular ratio as shown in Table III, the sintering was conducted under the same condition as Example 1, to thereby prepare specimen Nos. 41 to 44. The mechanical properties of each obtained sintered silicon nitride were determined, of which the results are also shown in Table III. For comparison, sintering agents of oxides which had not been subjected to co precipitation but had the same molecular ratio as the corresponding one of specimen Nos. 41 to 44 were used to sinter silicon nitride. The mechanical properties of the obtained specimen Nos. 51 to 54 are also shown in Table III. As shown in Table III, use of co precipitated powder containing Al₂O₃, and Y₂O, in a molecular ratio from 20 80 to 8 20 is very effective for improving mechanical properties of the resulting sintered silicon nitride. Co precipitated powders each including Zr and Y at a certain molecular ratio were burned in atmosphere at a temperature ranging from 800 to 1000 C to thereby provide a co precipitated powder containing ZrO₂ and Y₂O₃ at a weight ratio of 1 2. Then, the obtained powder was mixed in an amount indicated in Table IV with silicon nitride powder and compacted. The compact was sintered at 1800 C for 2 hours under nitrogen atmosphere of 8.0 atms to obtain specimen Nos. 66 to 70. For comparison, powders of ZrO₂ and Y₂O₃ were added to a silicon nitride powder respectively in the same amount as the corresponding one of specimen Nos. 66 to 70. The powder mixture was mixed and ground by a ball mill and then sintered under the same oondition as the above to obtain specimen Nos. 61 to 65. The mechanical properties of the sintered products are shown in Table IV. Specimen Nos. 67 to 69 which were prepared according to an embodiment of the present invention present excellent physical properties as compared with specimen Nos. 61 to 66 arid 70. Specimen Nos. 66 and 70 are degraded because the content of the sintering agent is out of the range according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention. By using powders as shown in Table V as the sintering agent silicon nitride was sintered under the same condition as Example 4. That is, in the examples according to the present invention, that is, specimen Nos. 84 to 86, powders which had been co precipitated and burned were used. On the other hand, in the comparison examples, powders of metal oxides which had not been subjected to co precipitation were used in the same amount and at the same molecular ratio as the corresponding one of specimen Nos. 84 to 86, to thereby obtain specimen Nos. 81 to 83. The mechanical properties of the resulting sintered silicon nitride are shown also in Table V. The results shown in Table V reveal that use of La₂O₃ and ZrO₂ exerts the same technical effect as use of Y₂O₃ and ZrO₂. That is, due to the co precipitated powder of La₂O₃ ZrO₂, mechanical properties of the resulting sintered material are highly improved. Although such an improvement is also observed as compared with specimen No. 81, specimen No. 84 is degraded because the content of the sintering agent is insufficient. It has been also confirmed that the co precipitated powder which has not been converted to oxides exerts the same technical effect as the co precipitated powder of oxides. Co precipitated powders each containing ZrO₂ and Y₂O₃ or lanthanum oxide were added to sinter silicon nitride in amounts indicated in Table VI under the same condition as Example 4. The mechanical properties of the resulting sintered silicon nitride are shown in Table VI. As shown in Table VI, it is understood that by using ZrO₂ in an amount of 1 to 25 vol and oxide of Y or Laof 0,5 to 10 wt in terms of the amount of metal element, an excellent improvement in the mechanical properties can be attained. In more detail, specimen No. 91 is degraded in mechanical properties due to its insufficient content of ZrO₂, while specimen No. 98 is degraded particularly in bending strength because the ZrO₂ content is too high. With respect to the Y₂O₃ content, the mechanical properties of specimen Nos. 99 and 100 are not so improved since the Y₂O₃ content is too low, while specimen No. 105 is degraded particularly in bending strength because the Y₂O₃ content is too high. Further, we confirmed that use of the co precipitated power of hydroxides of Zr and Y or lanthanum exerts the same technical effect as the co precipitated powder of oxides thereof. Powder of compounds of elements of IVa, Va, VIa groups of the Periodic Table were respectively added in an amount shown in Table VII together with a co precipitated powder composed of ZrO₂ and Y₂O₃ to a silicon nitride powder. The mixture of the powder was thoroughly mixed and ground and then compacted. The compact was sintered at 1850 C for 2 hours under a nitrogen atmosphere of 20 atms. The content of ZrO₂ and Y₂O, in the resulting sintered silicon nitride were 2.0 wt and 4.0 wt respectively. The mechanical properties of the obtained sintered silicon nitride are shown in Table VII. Specimens containing the element of IVa, Va and VIa groups of the Periodic Table in an amount of 1 to 15 wt , that is, specimen Nos. 112 to 114 and 117 to 122 have excellent mechanical properties as comparedwith specimen No. 110 which does not contain said element. The bending strength of specimen No. 111 is, however, degraded as compared with specimen No. 110 because the content of TiN is too low. To the contrary, specimen No. 116 is degraded particularly in bending strength because it contains too high amount of TiN.
