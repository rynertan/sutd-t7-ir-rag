The present invention is in the fields of genetic engineering and plant husbandry, and especially provides means for promotion of transcription in plants. Following are publications which disclose background information related to the present invention. These publications are discussed in greater depth in the Background sections indicated and in Example 1. P. Dhaese Shuttle vectors, developed by G. B. Ruvkun and F. M. Ausubel 1981 Nature A shuttle vector consists of a DNA molecule, usually a plasmid, capable of being introduced into the ultimate recipient bacteria. It also includes a copy of the fragment of the recipient genome into which the foreign genetic material is to be inserted and a DNA segment coding for a selectable trait, which is also inserted into the recipient genome fragment. The selectable trait marker is conveniently inserted by transposon mutagenesis or by restriction enzymes and ligases. The shuttle vector can be introduced into the ultimate recipient cell, typically a bacterium of the family Rhizobiaceae which contains the genus After the shuttle vector is introduced into the recipient cell, Possible events include a double cross over with one recombinational event on either side of the marker. This event will result in transfer of a DNA segment containing the marker to the recipient genome replacing a homologous segment lacking the insert. To select for cells that have lost the original shuttle vector, the shuttle vector must be incapable of replicating in the ultimate host cell or be incompatible with an independently selectable plasmid pre existing in the recipient cell. One common means of arranging this is to provide in the third parent another plasmid which is incompatible with the shuttle vector and which carries a different drug resistance marker. Therefore, when one selects for resistance to both drugs, the only surviving cells are those in which the marker on the shuttle vector has recombined with the recipient genome. If the shuttle vector carries an extra marker, one can then screen for and discard cells that contain plasmids resulting from a single cross over event between the shuttle vector and the recipient plasmid resulting in cointegrates in which the entire shuttle vector is integrated with the recipient plasmid. If the foreign genetic material is inserted into or adjacent to the marker that is selected for, it will also be integrated into the recipient plasmid as a result of the same double recombination. It might also be carried along when inserted into the homologous fragment at a spot not within or adjacent to the marker, but the greater the distance separating the foreign genetic material from the marker, the more likely will be a recombinational event occurring between the foreign genetic material and marker, preventing transfer of the foreign genetic material. If the shuttle vector is used to introduce a phenotypically dominant trait e.g. a novel expressible insecticide structural gene, but not an inactivated oncogenic T DNA gene one need not rely on a double homologous recombination. The cells resulting from a single cross over event resulting in cointegrate plasmids can transfer the desired trait into plant cells A. Caplan Shuttle vectors have proved useful in manipulation of Agrobacterium plasmids see D. J. Garfinkel A recently disclosed variation of the shuttle vector system for inserting changes into large DNA molecules is the suicide vector . In this system, as described by A. Puhler An alternative to the use of shuttle vectors for introduction of novel DNA sequences into T DNA by means of homologous recombination involves bacterial transposons. As described in the section Agrobacterium Genes on the TIP Plasmids, transposons can jump into the T DNA of a TIP plasmid e.g. see D. J. Garfinkel Included within the gram negative bacterial family Rhizobiaceae in the genus Virulent strains of M. D. Chilton June 1983 Sci. Amer. Plant cells can be transformed by The infection of plant tissue by Plant protoplasts can be transformed by the direct uptake of TIP plasmids. M. R. Davey An alternative method to obtain DNA uptake involves the use of liposomes. The preparation of DNA containing liposomes is taught by Papahadjopoulos in US Patents 4,078,052 and 4,235,871.

Yadav As detailed in the section on Shuttle Vectors, technology has been developed for the introduction of altered DNA sequences into desired locations on a TIP plasmid. Transposons can be easily inserted using this technology D. J. Garfinkel Deletions can be generated in a TIP plasmid by several methods. Shuttle vectors can be used to introduce deletions constructed by standard recombinant DNA techniques S. N. Cohen and H. W. Boyer, US Pat. 4,237,224 . Deletions with one predetermined end can be created by the improper excision of transposons B. P. Koekman The nopaline synthase gene has been used for insertion of DNA segments coding for drug resistance that can be used to select for transformed plant cells. In plant cells, a bacterial kanamycin resistance gene from Tn5 is not transcribed under control of its own promoter J. D. Kemp N. Murai A. J. de Framond Chilton One object of this invention is to provide means for promoting the expression of structural genes within plant cells wherein said genes are foreign to said cells. In pursuance of this goal, other objects are to provide T DNA derived promoters and T DNA derived polyadenylation sites, which are DNA sequences capable of controlling structural gene transcription and translation within plant cells. Another object is to provide specialized plant tissues and plants having within them proteins encoded by foreign structural genes and, in cases where the protein is an enzyme, having or lacking metabolites or chemicals which respectively are not or are otherwise found in the cells in which the genes are inserted. Other objects and advantages will become evident from the following description. According to the present invention, there is provided a DNA vector comprising a promoter, a non T DNA structural gene, and a polyadenylation site, wherein Also provided by the present invention is a transformable plant cell comprising a non T DNA, foreign structural gene flanked by a promoter and a polyadenylation site, wherein The invention disclosed herein provides a plant comprising a genetically modified plant cell have a foreign structural gene introduced and expressed therein under control of T DNA derived plant expressible transcriptional control sequences TxCS . Further, the invention provides plant tissue comprising a plant cell whose genome includes T DNA comprising a foreign structural gene inserted in such orientation and spacing with respect to T DNA derived plant expressible TxCS as to be expressible in the plant cell under control of those sequences. Also provided are novel strains of bacteria containing and replicating T DNA, the T DNA being modified to contain an inserted foreign structural gene in such orientation and spacing with respect to a T DNA derived plant expressible TxCS as to be expressible in a plant cell under control of said TxCS. Additionally, the invention provides novel vectors having the ability to replicate in The experimental work presented herein is believed to be the first disclosure of a complete T DNA sequence. The availability of this sequence will enable and otherwise facilitate work in the art of plant transformation to express foreign structual genes and to engage in other manipulations of T DNA and T DNA derived sequences. Without the newly disclosed T DNA sequence, those of ordinary skill in the art would be unable to make use of the newly disclosed promoters and polyadenylation sites contained therein so as to promote transcription in plant cells of foreign structural genes. The disclosed sequence reveals the existence of several previously unknown T DNA genes and associated transcriptional control sequences, and makes possible construction of recombinant DNA molecules using promoters and polyadenylation sites from T DNA genes whose sequences were hitherto unavailable to the public. The present invention comprises foreign structural genes under control of certain T DNA promoters expressible in plant cells and or certain T DNA polyadenylation sites, said promoter gene polyadenylation site combination being inserted into a plant cell by any means known to the art. More specifically, in its preferred embodiment the invention disclosed herein further comprises expression in plant cells of foreign structural genes under control of certain T DNA derived plant expressible TxCS s, after introduction via T DNA, that is to say, by inserting the foreign structural gene into T DNA under control of a T DNA promoter and or ahead of a T DNA polyadenylation site and introducing the T DNA containing the insert into a plant cell using known means. Once plant cells expressing a foreign structural gene under control of a T DNA TxCS are obtained, plant tissues and whole plants can be regenerated therefrom using methods and techniques well known in the art. The regenerated plants are then reproduced by conventional means and the introduced genes can be transferred to other strains and cultivars by conventional plant breeding techniques. The invention in principle applies to any introduction of a foreign structural gene into any plant species into which foreign DNA in the preferred embodiment T DNA can be introduced by any means and in which said DNA can remain stably replicated. In general, these taxa presently include, but are not limited to, gymnosperms and dicotyledenous plants, such as sunflower family Compositeae , tobacco family Solanaceae , alfalfa, soybeans, and other legumes family Leguminoseae , cotton family Malvaceae , and most vegetables. The invention is useful for genetically modifying plant cells, plant tissues, and whole plants by inserting useful structural genes from other species, organisms, or strains. Such useful structural genes include, but are not limited to, genes conveying phenotypes such as improved tolerance to extremes of heat or cold, improved tolerance to drought or osmotic stress, improved resistance or tolerance to insect e.g. insecticidal toxins , arachnid, nematode, or epiphyte pests and fungal , bacterial, or viral diseases, the production of enzymes or secondary metabolites not normally found in said tissues or plants, improved nutritional e.g. storage proteins, lectins, and legume lectins , flavor e.g. sweet proteins , or processing properties when used for fiber or human or animal food, changed morphological traits or developmental patterns e.g. leaf hairs which protect the plant from insects, coloring which is aesthetically pleasing, changed plant growth habits, dwarf plants, reduced time needed for the plants to reach maturity, expression of a gene in a tissue or at a time that gene is not usually expressed, and the like , male sterility, improved photosynthetic efficiency including lowered photo respiration , improved nitrogen fixation, improved uptake of nutrients, improved tolerance to herbicides, increased crop yield, improved competition with other plants, and improved germplasm identification by the presence of one or more characteristic nucleic acid sequences, proteins, or gene products, or phenotypes however identified to distinguish a genetically modified plant of the present invention from plants which are not so modified, to facilitate transfer of a linked artificially introduced phenotype by other e.g. sexual means to other genotypes or to facilitate identification of plants protected by patents or by plant variety protection certificates , resistance in cell or tissue culture to selective agents i.e. selectable markers , and the like. The invention is exemplified by introduction and expression of a structural gene for phaseolin, the major seed storage protein of the bean Figure 1. discloses the complete nucleotide sequence of the T DNA region of the octopine Ti plasmid pTi15955. Only one strand of DNA is shown, oriented 5 to 3 with the left and right borders, as defined in Fig. 2, near the beginning and end of the sequence, respectively. Figure 2. is a physical map of the region of pTi15955 sequenced. The restriction maps for 5 enzymes are shown and the shaded areas indicate the fragments which were subcloned for sequencing. Known genetic loci are indicated within the boxes. The 24 base border repeats shown at position A, B, C and D divide the T DNA into TL DNA, TC DNA and TR DNA. The open reading frames within the T DNA region are numbered from 1 to 26 and the arrows indicate their length and direction of transcription. Open reading frames a and b occur outside the T DNA region in the flanking Ti plamid DNA. Figure 3. includes a histogram showing the positions of possible stem loop structures within the T DNA. The arrows indicate the transcripts. The 24 base border repeats are at positions A, B, C and D and known genetic loci are indicated within the boxes. Figure 4. is a schematic diagram, not drawn to scale, of the DNA manipulation strategy utilized in the Examples. Sites susceptible to the action of a restriction enzyme are indicated by that enzyme s name or place of listing in a Table. A site that is no longer susceptible to the enzyme is indicated by the presence of parentheses around the name of the enzyme. The extent and polarity of an ORF is indicated by arrows as in Figures 2 and 3. Names of plasmids, again sometimes designated by place of listing in a Table, are within the circular representations of the plasmids. Ex refers to the Example which describes a particular manipulation. The following definitions are provided, in order to remove ambiguities to the intent or scope of their usage in the specification and claims. Production of a genetically modified plant expressing a foreign structual gene under control of an oT DNA derived TxCS combines the specific teachings of the present disclosure with a variety of techniques and expedients known in the art. In most instances, alternative expedients exist for each stage of the overall process. The choice of expedients depends on variables such as the choice of the basic vector system for the introduction and stable maintenance of the oT DNA TxCS structural gene combination, the plant species to be modified and the desired regeneration strategy, and the particular foreign structural gene to be used, all of which present alternative process steps which those of ordinary skill are able to select and use to achieve a desired result. For instance, although the starting point for obtaining oT DNA TxCS s is exemplified in the present application by oT DNA isolated from pTi15955. DNA sequences of other homologous octopine type Ti plasmids might be substituted as long as appropriate modifications are made to the TxCS isolation and manipulation procedures. Additionally, T DNA genes from other types of T DNA homologous to the oT DNA genes having TxCS s disclosed herein may be substituted, again with appropriate modifications of procedures. Homologous genes may be identified by those of ordinary skill in the art by the ability of their nucleic acids to cross hybridize under conditions of appropriate stringency as is well understood in the art. It will be understood that there may be minor sequence variations within gene sequences utilized or disclosed in the present application. These variations may be determined by standard techniques to enable those of ordinary skill in the art to manipulate and bring into utility the T DNA promoters and polyadenylation sites of such homologous genes. Homologs of foreign structural genes may be identified, isolated, sequenced, and manipulated in a manner similar to homologs of the pTi15955 genes of the present invention. As novel means are developed for the stable insertion of foreign genes in plant cells, those of ordinary skill in the art will be able to select among those alternate process steps to achieve a desired result. The fundamental aspects of the invention are the nature and structure of the foreign structural gene and its means of insertion and expression in a plant genome. The remaining steps of the preferred embodiment for obtaining a genetically modified plant include inserting the oT DNA TxCS structural gene combination into T DNA, transferring the modified T DNA to a plant cell wherein the modified T DNA becomes stably integrated as part of the plant cell genome, techniques for A principal feature of the present invention in its preferred embodiment is the construction of T DNA having an inserted foreign structural gene under control of a oT DNA TxCS, i.e., between a promoter and a polyadenylation site, as these terms have been defined, A TxCS is comprised by two major functionalities a promoter and a polyadenylation site, positioned respectively 5 and 3 to the structural gene. Although in the preferred embodiment these two portions of the TxCS are obtained from the same gene, this is not a requirement of the present invention. These 5 and 3 sequences may be obtained from diverse oT DNA genes, or one of these sequences may even be obtained from a non oT DNA gene. For instance, a promoter may be taken from a oT DNA gene while the polyadenylation site may come from a plant gene or a cDNA. In the preferred embodiments a foreign structural gene is nested within a oT DNA TxCS, suturing the structural gene into the TxCS at Location of the TxCS foreign structural gene combination insertion site within T DNA is not critical as long as the transfer function of sequences immediately surrounding the T DNA borders are not disrupted, since these regions appear from prior art studies to be essential for insertion of the modified T DNA into the plant genome. Preferred insertion sites are those which lie in areas that are most actively transcribed, in particular ORF10 the A convenient means for inserting a TxCS foreign structural gene combination into T DNA involves the use of a shuttle vector, as described in the Background, having segments of T DNA those segments between which insertion is desired incorporated into a plasmid capable of replicating in Following the strategy just described, the modified T DNA can be transferred to plant cells by any technique known in the art. For example, this transfer is most conveniently accomplished either by direct infection of plants with the novel An alternative to the shuttle vector strategy involves the use of plasmids comprising T DNA or modified T DNA, into which an TxCS foreign structural gene is inserted, said plasmids being capable of independent replication in an Although the preferred embodiment of this invention incorporates a T DNA based Regeneration of transformed cells and tissues is accomplished by resort to known techniques. An object of the regeneration step is to obtain a whole plant that grows and reproduces normally but which retains integrated T DNA. The techniques of regeneration vary somewhat according to principles known in the art, depending upon the origin of the T DNA, the nature of any modifications thereto and the species of the transformed plant. Plant cells transformed by an Ri type T DNA are readily regenerated, using techniques well known to those of ordinary skill, without undue experimentation. Plant cells transformed by Ti type T DNA can be regenerated, in some instances, by the proper manipulation of hormone levels in culture. Preferably, however, the Ti transformed tissue is most easily regenerated if the T DNA has been mutated in one or both of the The genotype of the plant tissue transformed is often chosen for the ease with which its cells can be grown and regenerated in The following Examples utilize many techniques well known and accessible to those skilled in the arts of molecular biology and manipulation of TIP s and Textual use of the name of a restriction endonuclease in isolation, e.g. In the tables and in the text that follows, the underlining of a particular nucleotide in a primer or other sequence indicates the nucleotide which differs from the naturally found sequence, being an insertion or substitution of one or more nucleotides. The use of lower case for two adjacent nucleotides brackets one or more nucleotides that have been deleted from the native sequence. Unless otherwise noted, all oligonucleotide primers are phosphorylated at their 5 ends, are represented 5 to 3 , and are synthesized and used as described in Example 5. Plasmids, and only plasmids, are prefaced with a p , e.g. , pTi15955 or p8.8. Plasmid designation in parenthesis following species or strain designation indicate a plasmid harbored within the species or strain, e.g. , The DNA constructions described in these Examples have been designed to enable any one of the fourteen eukaryotic TxCS s of pTi15955 to be combined with any of four foreign structural genes. Towards that end, the structural genes, the TxCSs, and the TxCS structural gene combinations have been placed on DNA cassettes , having the properties that, after initial modifications have been made, any structural gene may be readily inserted into any TxCS without further modification, and any TxCS structural gene combination may be isolated by a simple procedure applicable to all such combinations. All combinations are thereby equivalent when being inserted into the plant transformation vector of choice. The initial modifications of the TxCS s are all analogous to each other and the initial modifications of the structural genes are also all analogous to each other. These Examples often involve the use of a common strategy for multiple constructions that differ only in items such as choice of restriction enzymes, DNA fragment size, ORFs encoded, plasmids generated or used as starting material, specific numbers and sequences of oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis, sources of plasmids, and enzyme reactions utilized. For the sake of brevity, the DNA manipulations and constructions are described once, the differing items being detailed by reference to a particular column in a particular Table, a particular series of manipulations used in a particular construction occupying horizontal lines within that Table. For example, Column 1 of Table 6, denoted as T6.1 , when instructing use of a particular restriction enzyme, might say ... was digested with T6.1 ... , and the construction of mLC T6.4 , which encodes ORFs 5, 8, and 9 T6.3 involves digestion with The following is an outline, diagrammed schematically in Figure 4, of a preferred strategy used to make the exemplified DNA constructions. Endogenous This example provides disclosure, analysis, and discussion of the pTi15955 T DNA sequencing results. The complete nucleotide sequence of the transferred region T DNA of an octopine tumor inducing Ti plasmid from The nucleotide sequence of a portion of pTi15955 containing the T DNA region is shown in Fig. 1. Only one strand of the DNA sequence is presented. It is orientated from 5 to 3 and extends continuously for 24,595 bases, from a It has been reported that extended direct repeats of 21 25 bases occur at the borders of the T DNA P. Zambryski The presence of four 24 bp border repeats provided clues to the mechanism by which the octopine T DNA can be integrated into the plant genome either as one continuous 23 kbp kilobase pairs segment or as two individual segments TL DNA of 13 kbp and TR DNA of 8 kbp. Integration of TL DNA was more obvious since it contains tumor inducing genes, which cause the formation of a crown gall in infected plants. TR DNA, however, lacked these genes and its integration could be detected by the use of opine assays. Nopaline T DNA contains only two known border repeats at its boundaries, thus it is transferred as a contiguous segment of 22 kbp. Because these border repeats occur in both octopine and nopaline Ti plasmids, they are thought to have a fundamental function in the transfer of the T region to the plant genome Zambryski A search for the first 12 bases of the 24 base direct repeat was conducted through the Los Alamos and EMBL data banks, which contain approximately 2,500,000 nucleotides from 2,000 different DNA sources. The repeat was only found at the reported borders of octopine and nopaline T DNA regions. Within the total T region, nine transcripts have previously been reported N. Murai and J. D. Kemp 1982 Nucl. Acids Res. The TL DNA region contained eight of the open reading frames having eukaryotic promoters numbers 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10 and 11. All of these corresponded to previously mapped transcripts C. Willmitzer The remaining six ORFs with eukaryotic promoters numbers 18, 19, 21, 24, 25 and 26 of Table 4 all occurred within the TR DNA. Only one transcript has been reported in this region and it corresponds to ORF 24, which prior to the present application, has been referred to as the 1.6 kb transcript encoded by the 1.6 region . The function of this transcript is not yet fully known although insertion into the The remaining open reading frames did not contain concensus sequences corresponding to eukaryotic transcription signals. Because of the nucleotide variation occurring within the 10 Pribnow box and 35 regions of prokaryotic promoter sequences reviewed by M. Rosenberg and D. Court 1979 Ann. Rev. Genet. All of the transcripts were analyzed individually for codon usage, with an emphasis on codon bias for prokaryotic and eukaryotic transcripts. No bias in codon usage was detected in any of the ORF s within the T region. There was also no bias between the eukaryotic and prokaryotic transcripts within the T DNA region. This indicates that genes not having the usual plant gene codon bias will be expressed under control of the T DNA TxCS s. Because inserted repeats might constitute recognition and regulatory sites on DNA D. M. J. Lilley 1980 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA This Example discloses the materials and methods used to sequence DNA in general, and the T DNA of pTi15955 in particular. Ultra pure urea was obtained from BRL Gaithersburg, Maryland , polyacrylamide from BDH Poole, England , calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase from Boehringer Mannheim, W. Germany , polynucleotide kinase from P. L. Biochemicals, Inc. Milwaukee, Wisconsin , and γ ³²P ATP from New England Nuclear Boston, Massachusetts .

The shaded areas indicate fragments which were sub cloned into pBR322 and then propagated in either Long sequencing gels 20 cm in width, 110 cm in length and 0.2mm in thickness were used to separate the oligonucleotides.

Verrips Phaseolin and lectin, as initially translated have signal peptides at their amino termini, as was the case with thaumatin. If desired, these signal peptides may be eliminated by placing the 5 This Example describes techniques for the synthesis and use of synthetic oligonucleotides. Other useful references can be found in the list of works cited in the section introductory to these Examples. The techniques for chemical synthesis of DNA fragments used in these Examples utilize a number of techniques well known to those skilled in the art of DNA synthesis. The modification of nucleosides is described by H. Schallor General methods of directed mutagenesis have been reviewed recently by D. Shortle The sequence to be modified usually is moved into a single stranded bacteriophage vector, here one derived from M13, by standard techniques well known to those in the art. The vector DNA is generally in the double stranded replicative form RF , as the single stranded viral form cannot ordinarily be cut and spliced by restriction enzymes and ligases. After This Example teaches use of the oT DNA TxCS s and the foreign structural genes manipulated in Example 3 and 4, respectively. The plasmids listed in T8.1 are digested with The TxCS foreign structural gene combinations may be removed from the M13 based vectors constructed in Example 6.1 by digestion with The plant transformation vector into which the TxCS gene combination is to be inserted may be a TIP based system such as a TIP plasmid, a shuttle vector for introduction of novel DNA s into TIP plasmids, or a sub TIP plasmid, e.g. mini Ti or micro Ti. Alternatively, a vector based upon a DNA virus, minichromosome, transposon, and homologous or nonhomologous recombination into plant chromosomes may be utilized. Any mode of delivery into the plant cell which is to be initially transformed may be used which is appropriate to the particular plant transformation vector into which the TxCS gene combination is inserted. These forms of delivery include transfer from a The initially transformed plant cells are propagated and used to produce plant tissue and whole plants by any means known to the art which is appropriate for the plant transformation vector and delivery mode being used.
