# A method and an arrangement for the feed of a material web.

## Abstract
The feed of a material web provided with a pattern can be performed with the help of a rotating driver. When the feed is to be synchronous with a processing operation, or when for other reasons the feed must take place in register, the feed up to now has been monitored and corrected with the help of photocell equipment and photocell marks made on the web. In the case of material webs 2 which are provided with transverse crease lines 3 , as is customary for example in the packaging industry, the feed as well as the keeping in register may be done in accordance with the invention with the help of a feed mandrel 1 which engages with the transverse crease lines of the web by means of a number of edges 4 arranged around the circumference of the mandrel. Any faults in the mutual distance between the transverse crease lines are corrected automatically by the mandrel, and any special monitoring or subsequent correction of the feed is not necessary.
