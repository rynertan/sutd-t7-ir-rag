The clamp assembly comprises a radially expansible sleeve 90 mounted on the spindle and sized for recep tion into a central opening 15 of the disc. The expan sible sleeve cooperates with a wedge collet 92 biased downwardly by a spring 102 within a clamp housing 88 for uniform radial expansion of the sleeve and centering the disc upon the spindle. The clamp housing further includes means for locking engagement with the spindle to position a clamping ring 144 in spring biased engagement with the disc to clamp the disc securely upon the spindle for rotation therewith.
