# Apparatus for use in cutting hair.

## Abstract
An improved apparatus for cutting hair includes a pair of panels which are pivotally interconnected for movement between an open position in which the panels are spaced apart from each other and a closed position in which major sides of the panels are disposed in a side by side rela tionship. Each of the panels has a nonlinear pattern edge portion which is used to guide a haircutting device, such as scissors or a razor or clippers, along a nonlinear path. The pattern edge portions of the two panels have the same configuration with crests projecting outwardly away from base edge portions of the panels and troughs between the crests. In order to comb the hair and retain it against sidewise movement along the pattern edge portions, a large number of bristles extend outwardly from a major side of one of the panels. The hair is laid across the bristles when the panels are in the open position. The other panel is then clamped against the bristles to hold the hair.
