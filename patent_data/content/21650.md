# Analog to digital converter.

## Abstract
An analog to digital conversion system uses a fast analog to digital converter 16 having a resolution less than the system resolution to convert the difference between a previously predicted value and the current analog value. The converted difference is summed with the predicted value to compute the actual value of the analog input signal to a resolution greater than that of the fast analog to digital converter 16 . The high resolution digital value thus obtained becomes the predicted value for the next conversion. This predicted value is converted by a digital to analog converter 13 , having the same accuracy but not the same resolution as the system output, to an analog signal which is compared with the input analog signal to obtain a difference signal. This difference signal is sampled and held by a sample and hold amplifier 14 to provide an amplified sampled error signal to the input of the fast analog to digital converter 16 . The system includes a gain scaling and switching circuit 19, 17, 15 to compensate for errors which would otherwise occur when the difference between the true analog input and the prediction exceeds the range of the low resolution, fast analog to digital converter 16 .
