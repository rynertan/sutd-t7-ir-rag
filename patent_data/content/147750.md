# VIBRATION DAMPER FOR EVERHEAD CONDUCTOR

## Abstract
A device for damping vibrations of an overhead conduc tor, the device including a member adapted to be clamped to the conductor. The member has a clamping portion for engaging the conductor and an arm portion extending from the clamping portion. Opposed sides of the arm portion have rounded depressions provided therein. Spherical elastomer damping elements have portions located respectively in the depressions. A weight member is disposed adjacent the opposed sides of the clamping arm, the weight member having opposed depressions for holding portions of the damping elements that are opposite the portions located in the depressions of the clamping arm.
