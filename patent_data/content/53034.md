# Method of determining stress distribution in a solid body.

## Abstract
Two ultrasonic wave beams 11, 12 of different frequen cies are emitted into a body 1 under consideration from different locations on a surface of the body and a scattered wave beam 13 created at a scattering point 14 in the body by the interaction between the two ultrasonic wave beams is received. The emitting locations of the ultrasonic wave beams and the receiving location of the scattered wave beam are caused to scan. Thus, the stress distribution in the body is measured on the basis of the received outputs resulting from the scanning.
