## Description
COMPOUND ANIMAL FEEDSTUFFS The present invention relates to compound animal foodstuffs which contain preservative compositions for stabilising the feedstuffs against deterioration and in particular for preserving the feedstuffs against microbial attack. Ther term compound animal feedetuffs is used in its broadest sense throughout this specification to include cereals and cereal byproducts as major components eg up to 70 w w , a sizeable amount of vegetable and animal proteins eg up to 35Z w w , and minor amounts of miscellaneous components and vegetable products. In addition to the above such compound feedstuffs may contain small amounts of additives which include substances added to the feedstuff in the course of manufacture for some specific purpose other than as a direct source of nutrient. Virtually all compound feeds are susceptible to spoilage by moulds. Certain moulds have the capacity to produce chemical substances known as mycotoxins which are poisonous and have deleterious effects on animal performance, animal health and ultimately constitute a hazard to humans. Propionic acid and its neutral salts have been recognised for some time as anti mould chemicals. Propionic acid, although highly effective, is a corrosive liquid and is not ideally suited for use in compound feed mills where solid materials are preferred. The neutral salts calcium and sodium propionate are non corrosive solids but their anti mould activity is much reduced compared with propionic acid. It is possible to absorb propionic acid onto a solid carrier material cf US 4,199,606 but even in this form the product is unpleasant to handle, possesses a pungent smell and is susceptible to evaporative loss of the acid. It is an object of the present invention to provide a compound animal feedstuff which contains a solid preservative composition distributed therein. Accordingly, the present invention is a compound animal feedstuff having substantially uniformly distributed therein a solid preservative composition comprising potassium dipropionate. According to a further embodiment, the present invention is a compound animal feedstuff comprising by weight 50 852 of cereals and cereal by products, 0 25X of vegetable proteins, 0 10X of animal proteins and minor amounts of miscellaneous products and additives characterised in that said composition has substantially uniformly distributed therein a solid preservative composition comprising potassium dipropionate. According to yet another embodiment, the present invention is a compound animal feedstuff comprising by weight 50 85 of cereals and cereal by products, 5 252 of vegetable proteins, O lOZ of animal proteins and minor amounts of miscellaneous products and additives characterised in that said composition has substantially uniformly distributed therein a solid preservative composition comprising potassium dipropionate. Specific examples of cereals which are used in the compound animal feedstuffs include barley, wheat, oats, rye, maize, rice and mixtures thereof. The cereal by products referred to herein include malting byproducts. Examples of such by products which may be used in the compound feedstuffs include the unwanted products from the milling of the cereals referred to above to produce flour and from the germination and extraction of the cereals, especially grain, to produce malt for the brewing and the distillery industries. Examples of milling byproducts include wheat feed, oat hulls, wheat and rice, bran, maize gluten, malt culms, nutritionally improved straw etc.Products from the brewing and distillery industries include brewers grains, barley screenings and spent barley grains draff . The vegetable proteins referred to herein include those derived from soya beans, rape seed, sunflower seed, peas, beans etc. This class of materials includes soya bean oil meal and cake, and oil products resulting from linseed oil extraction. Examples of the animal proteins in the compound animal feedstuff include dairy products, fish meal and fish protein concentrate, meat meal and bone meal. The miscellaneous products referred to herein include one or more of beet pulp, molasses, fats, waste fruit and vegetable products, waste yeast and other microbial proteins eg single cell protein SCP , manioc, cassava and tapioca. The other additives referred to herein which are used in small quantities include vitamins, anti oxidants, emulsifiers, stabilisers, micronised clay and other processing aids, flavours, antibiotics, colourants, humectants and trace mineral supplements eg iron, manganese, calcium, cobalt, zinc and copper salts and sodium chloride. The solid potassium dipropionate used herein as preservative is suitably present in an amount of between 0.05 and 1.0 w w of the total compound animal feedstuff, preferably between 0.1 and 0.6X wlw. Solid potassium dipropionate as prepared is substantially free flowing and retains this property for a significant duration. However, if it is to be stored for long periods, it may be advantageous to add any of the conventional anticaking agents. Thus the addition of about 2Z w w based on the potassium dipropionate of synthetically precipitated silica eg Neosyl, Regd. Trade Mark, ex Joseph Crosfield Sons Ltd to the solid preservative greatly improves its flowability and reduces caking. Most large feed manufacturers use highly automated mixing procedures, whilst batch mixers are used in preparing smaller volumes. In the former case the ingredients ground to a small particle size where necessary are added at controlled rates as the mix is augered along a line. The solid potassium dipropionate can be added in this manner but it may be more suitable to prepare a pre mix containing some feed along with the preservative and other minor.components and meter the pre mix into the main process sequence to obtain better accuracy and improved distribution. Batch preparations are commonly carried out by adding all the ingredients ground to a small particle size where necessary to a batch mixer. The solid potassium dipropionate may be added directly to the mixer or in the form of a pre mix with other components. It is important that the potassium dipropionate be uniformly distributed throughout the compound feed. It is common practice to process the mixed feed further by using a special machine to press it into pellets or extrude it into other specially desired size or shapes. Animals generally prefer pelleted feeds to ground food. Solid potassium dipropionate preservative combines the high antimould activity of propionic acid with the good handling properties of the neutral salts. Also, unlike propionic acid absorbed onto a carrier, potassium dipropionate does not possess an unpleasant pungent odour and evaporative losses of the acid are gulch reduced. The anti mould activity of potassium dipropionate is demonstrated by the following Examples. EXAMPlES The method used for testing activity of inhibitors is that propounded by Dixon, R.C. et al in Poultry Science, 60, 2182 2188 1981 , which relies on the measurement of CO2 produced as a result of fungal respiration. Unlike visible mould growth which appears sometime after the initial events of fungal growth, CO2 is a primary product of metabolism which can be easily and accurately determined without disturbing the feed and is applicable to measurements under controlled conditions of moisture and temperature. The determination of CO2 levels would therefore appear to be potentially quicker and more objective than methods used hitherto and work has been carried out to carefully evaluate this method. Basically the method involves the measurement of CO2 contained in the head space gas above moist compound feed stored in sealed containers. The method was slightly modified and was then used to compare the preservative activity of solid potassium dipropionate with three established feed additives.

Portions lOOg of the feed were remoistened to 20Z w w moisture content by adding the required amount of water followed by mixing by hand. An accurately weighted quantity of mould inhibitor was added and the blend was mixed thoroughly with 8 glass rod. The treated feed was transferred to 500 ml Winchester bottles which were then sealed by a rubber septum and a screw cap. The cap had a 5 mm diameter hole in it to facilitate withdrawal of gas samples .The bottles were finally rolled for approximately 25 minutes on a set of motorised rollers. All treatments were prepared in triplicate and stored in the constant temperature room 230C .Analysis of head space gas 0.5 ml samples of head space gas were taken daily using a disposable syringe tuberculin type and analysed for CO2 by gas chromatography.
