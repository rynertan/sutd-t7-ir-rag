# PLANT FOR COATING PIPE, TUBING AND THE LIKE

## Abstract
Plant is described for coating the outside of pipe, tubing and the like. The plant is mobile and is housed in a plurality of standard I.S.O. shipping containers each of which mounts one or more of the plant items including inlet and outlet racks, an abrasive cleaning station, a coating station and conveyor means for conveying lengths of pipe, tubing and the like through the plant. By disposing the plant in said containers, pipe, tubing and the like can be coated at remote locations where the pipe is to be used, thereby avoiding possible damage to coated pipe in transit.
