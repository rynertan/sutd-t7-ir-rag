# A METHOD OF PREPARING MODIFIED HETEROPOLYSACCHARIDES IN BUFFERED BRINE AND THEIR USE FOR OIL RECOVERY

## Abstract
A process for preparing modified aqueous saline hetero polysaccharide solutions containing at least 0.5 wt. of inorganic salts wherein the solutions are stabilized against loss of pyruvate groups on heat treatment. The process comprises preparing an aqueous solution containing heteropolysaccha ride and inorganic salts, adding a buffer to control pH between about 6.5 and 10.0, heating to a temperature of at least 100 C and maintaining the pH at from 6.0 to 9.5 during heating, then removing cell debris. The buffered solutions do not suffer loss of pyruvate content while maintaining improved filterability and viscosity.
