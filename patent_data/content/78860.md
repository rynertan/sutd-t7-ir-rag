R1 preferably are straight or branched saturated hydrocarbon groups, in R2 particular straight alkyl groups. R2 preferably are straight saturated or such hydrocarbon groups with 12 to 18 carbon atoms having one olefine doublebond.The compounds according to the present invention show interesting pharmacological properties. The new compounds have both anti inflammatory and lipid decreasing properties.The acylamino thiophen carboxylic acids of the present invention have anti inflammatory activity both in vitro and in vivo. They furthermore show an advantageous inhibation of the complement system. Furthermore, they decrease the platelet aggregation. These valuable pharmacological properties are furthermore supplemented by a significant plaques reduction in animals, a decrease of the total cholesterol, an increase of the A lipoproteins and a reduction of the 13 lipoproteins. Thus, the N alkyl N acyl amino thiophen carboxylic acid derivatives may in particular be used for the treatment of inflammatory, arteriosclerotic and thrombotic diseases.Their use in dosages ranging from 1 to 500 mg kg, in particular 10 to 300 mg kg and most preferably from 20 to 200 mg kg.The acylamino thiophen carboxylic acid derivatives according to the present invention may be used as free acids or as the alkali salts thereof or as the esters of C1 3 alcohols as active agent in pharmaceutical preprations together with usual carrier materials or dilluents. Esters of alcohols with 1 to 3 carbon atoms are particularly useful for oral administration.The acylamino thiophen carboxylic acids and their derivatives are mostly produced by processes the chemical reaction whereof is knon as such. The starting materials of the present process are the known carboxylic acid amides of the general formula IIEMI2.1 wherein R1 has teh same meaning as in formula I. The compounds of formula II are alkylated at the nitrogen atom in accordance with the chemical reaction described byW. STEINSOFF, Liebigs Ann. vol. 403, p. 17.

When oxydizing the aldehydes of formula IV with usual oxydizing agents such as potassium permanganate in an aqueous organic solvent, the new acids of formula IEMI3.3 wherein R3 is hydrogen, are obtained.The free acids of formula I R3 H may be converted to their alkali methyl salts wherein R3 is alkali, by subjecting the acids to reaction with an alkali methyl hydroxide or carbonate in an aqueous or alcoholic aqueous solvent and recovering the salts by evaporating the resulting solution.The salts of formula I wherein R3 is an alkali, may be converted into the corresponding esters of formula I with R3 being an C1 3 alkyl, by alkylating the salts with a alkyl halide or a similar alkylating agent having the formula V R3 X V wherein R3 is a straight or branched C13 alkyl group andX is a halogen such as Cl, Br, J or another usual group readily split of during alkylation, in a polar aprotic solvent.On the other side, esters of the formula I whereinR3 is alkyl, may also be produced by subjecting the acids of formula I with R3 being hydrogen or their alkali salts with R3 being alkali, at first to reaction with thionyl chloride, possibly in an organic solvent, and further reaction with an alcohol of the formula R3 OH, R3 having the same meaning as in formula I.Suitable substituted acid amides of formula II are for instance N 2 thienyl acetamide, N 2 thienyl propionic acid amide,N 2 thienyl butyric acid amide,N 2 thienyl valerianic acid amide, N 2 thienyl capronic acid amide.For preparing the compounds of formula III from the compounds of formula II there may be used as alkylating agent of formula R2 X for instance bromododec ane,bromotr idecane, bromotetr adec ane, bromopenta decane, bromohexadecane, bromoheptadecane, bromooctadecane and the corresponding chloro and iodo compounds.The full synthesis is further explained with some of the compounds III and IV and the resulting final compounds of formula I.
