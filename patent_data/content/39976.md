# A DEVICE FOR THE TRANSFER OF ARTICLES TO BE MACHINED ON MACHINE TOOLS FROM ONE WORK STATION TO THE NEXT ONE

## Abstract
A device for the transfer of articles to be machined from one work station to the next one, said device consisting of a reciprocable carriage, at least one gripping unit, which is mounted at a fixed location on the carriage and which is provided with a pair of levers, movable relative to each other, with the gripper jaw at the one end and a control member at the other end and located therebetween a fixed pivotal axis for the lever on the carriage, said control member being in engagement with a driving member which is adapted to be driven by a piston cylinder unit and with which the levers are movable in the one direction, as well as with one or more resilient elements which continuously tend to push the levers in the other direction. The device according to the invention is characterized in that the piston cylinder unit is connected via an electromag netically operable valve, to a pressurized air feed conduit and that by means of a freely movable quick relieve valve, the piston cylinder unit is connected to a discharge conduit, debouching into the ambient air.
