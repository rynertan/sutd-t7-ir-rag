# Capacitive pressure transducer.

## Abstract
A capacitive pressure transducer utilizing a plate 10 of electrically conductive semi conductor material sandwiched between a pair of plates 16, 16a of inorganic electrically insulating material and electrostatically bonded thereto. A pair of concentric circular recesses 12,12a are etched in the plates in such a way as to form cavities on opposing sides of conductive plate and to define a diaphragm area on that plate. Apertures 24, 24a are drilled through the insulating plates to expose the cavities to the pressures to be mea sured. The surfaces of the insulating plates in the cavities have deposited on them electrically conductive surfaces 18,18a which form capacitors with the diaphragm area on the conductive plate. A stress relief area is provided on the high pressure side surrounding the diaphragm area. In that stress relief area, the conductive plate is unrestrained by the adjacent insulating plate. Provision of this stress relief makes it possible to extend the pressure range of the transducer beyond the range which would normally be useful for the dimensions of the particular transducer.
