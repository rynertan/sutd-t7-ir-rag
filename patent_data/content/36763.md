# Method and apparatus for forming a closure of plastics material in an aperture in a metal substrate.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for sealing a plastics material to metal 3 comprises the steps of locating the sheet of metal 3 between an upper die 11 and a lower die 12 with the aper ture there between, clamping the sheet of metal 3 between the upper and lower dies 11, 12 so that a cavity 14 in the upper die 11 spans the aperture, a cavity 15 in the lower die 12 spans the aperture and the aperture in the sheet of metal connects said cavities 14, 15 to act as a mould shape, intro ducing a plastics material into the mould shape to mould a clo sure keyed in the aperture, heating at least a peripheral margin of the wall 3 around the aperture to seal the plastics material to the peripheral margin, and thereafter opening the dies 11, 12 to permit removal of the closed wall 3 from the dies 11, 12 . The preferred apparatus for carrying out the method has an induction coil 17 to heat the peripheral edge of the aper ture. Passages for a fluid coolant may be provided in one of the dies.
