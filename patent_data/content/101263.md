# CONTAMINATION LEVEL INDICATOR

## Abstract
Apparatus for providing an indication of the level of contaminant in a fluid includes a pervious barrier 12 disposed across a fluid path 11 so that the barrier 12 will be progressively blocked by contaminant in the fluid. Monitoring means responsive to the rate of blocking of the barrier provides an indication of the level of contaminant in the fluid. The monitoring means may be means for sensing measurements representing the rate at which the pressure of the fluid upstream of the barrier 12 rises. Alternatively the monitoring means senses measurements representing the rate at which the flow rate of fluid through the barrier 12 falls. The provision of an indication conveniently completes a measurement cycle and there is means for renewing the barrier, either by back flushing the barrier 12 or alternative ly by exchanging one barrier for another.
