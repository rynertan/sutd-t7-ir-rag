# Process for separating hydrocarbon mixtures by extractive distillation.

## Abstract
A process of extractive distillation for separating the components more easily soluble in a polar solvent from at least two hydrocarbon mixtures having different contents of the more easily soluble components comprises feeding a hydrocarbon mixture containing a larger amount of the easily soluble components, as a gas, into the middle or lower portion F₁ , of an extractive distillation column, feeding a hydrocarbon mixture containing a smaller amount of the easily soluble components, as a liquid, to the upper portion F₂ of the extractive distillation column, and subjecting them to extractive distillation using the polar solvent.
