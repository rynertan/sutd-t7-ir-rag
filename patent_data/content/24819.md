# Production of methanol.

## Abstract
In the production of methanol from a methane containing gaseous feedstock such as natural gas by steam reforming the gas and treating the reformate to produce methanol by inter reaction of the hydrogen and oxides of carbon in the reformate, the use of part of the feedstock to fire the reformer is avoided by immersing the reformer reactor tubes in a fluidised bed heated by the combustion of a low grade, solid, fossil based fuel such as coal, lignite, oil shale or asphaltic residues from oil refining. By pressurising the fluid ised bed, all the power requirements of the process can be obtained by expansion of the flue gas, which can also provide the COâ‚‚ balance for the methanol synthesis, and a compres sor can be omitted.
