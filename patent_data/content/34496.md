# Method of and apparatus for continuous friction actuated extrusion.

## Abstract
In a modified Conform machine for continuous friction actuated extrusion of metals, especialiy particulate copper, the abutment 11 at the outlet end of the working passageway does not fully block the end of the wheel groove 2 . Instead a substantial clearance y is left, and metal extrud ing through it adheres to the wheel to re enter the working passageway at the entry end. Preferably the abutment is of semicircular cross section. For a given output rate, a signific ant reduction in torque, and working stresses, is obtained.
