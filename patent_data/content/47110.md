# LIGHT DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM FOR OPTICAL ENCODERS

## Abstract
The invention provides a light distribution system for optical encoders including a light guide plate 28 and a light input coupler Figs. 1 5 87 Fig. 6 90 Fig. 7 89 for distributing input incident radiations into the light guide plate as a flat distributed beam of beam segments 114 intercepted by a pattern of discrete light output couplers Figs. 3, 4 50 54 reflecting narrow output beams Figs. 5, 8 30 for providing a uniform pattern of encoding illumina tions.
