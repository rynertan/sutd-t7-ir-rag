## Description
The present invention relates to a measurement head for use with a welding robot for measuring the shape of a portion of a workpiece to be welded and the position of the workpiece portion with respect to the welding robot. It has heretofore been conventional to use microcomputer controlled electric spot welding robots for automatically welding relatively thin iron sheets such as in assembling automobiles. In building construction and shipbuilding, however, arc welding must be employed since considerably thick sheets of iron, 10 mm or more thick, for example, are required to be welded. Therefore, the spot wielding robots cannot be used in building and ship construction. One prior practice for such welding applications has been to use a measurement head coupled to a welding torch for detecting the position of the welding torch relative to a workpiece and moving the welding torch properly to the desired position. It has been proposed to employ an electromagnetic sensor such as a coil as the measurement head. With this prior art measurement head, it is possible to determine only the distance of the head relative to planes of iron sheets to be welded. Furthermore, to avoid thermal influences, the sensor needs to be spaced a moderate distance from the welding arc and hence cannot necessarily provide information representing the shape of a portion to be welded and an adjacent area. Accordingly, the conventional measurement head fails to effect accurate positional control of the welding torch. Another method practiced in the art has been to weave the welding torch laterally through a given width across a workpiece portion to be welded and to adjust the position of the welding torch so that an arc current flowing at the time will vary in a symmetrical pattern. This method is effective only when metal sheets to be welded are abutted each other to form a symmetrical configuration with respect to the joint line. According to still another method, a fan beam of light is projected on a workpiece to be welded, the resulting bright stripe on the workpiece corresponding to a sectional line thereof is picked up by an industrial television camera and the obtained image data is processed to determine the sectional line, and the welding torch is positionally controlled on the basis of shape of the sectional line. However, when observing an area closely adjacent to the welding arc, it is difficult to separate an image signal corresponding to the bright stripe from a strong flare of the light from the welding torch. The three prior techniques as described above are described in Development and Application of Sensors and Sensor System for Arc Welding in Japan IIW XII C 031 82 reported by I. MASUMOTO in International Institute of Welding IIW , 1982. The article Development of an optical distance sensor for robots , International Journal of Robotics Research, volume 1, no. 4, 1982, pages 3 14, discloses a measurement equipment comprising the features of the entering portion of claim 1. The article is directed the development of an optical sensor for measuring short range distances with high potential for local control of a manipulator at the handling point of an object. To eliminate the influence of illumination on the measurement environment a comparison of two sensor signals is described which have been obtained in successive on and off states of the light emitting means. It is suggested that with this method distances can be detected correctly even if the object is a luminous body. An indication concerning an accurate determination of distances of a working piece in close proximity of a welding arc is not given. It is an object of the present invention to provide a measurement head for use with welding robots which is capable of measuring the shape of a work piece and finding out the portion to be welded with high accuracy without being affected by welding arc light. This object is solved according to the invention by a measurement equipment for welding machines comprising the features of claim 1. Further advantageous developments are referred to by the features of the dependent claims. According to the present invention, it is arranged such that a bright spot or stripe and a view spot or slits visual field which is being observed will meet or intersect each other when one or both of a direction in which light is emitted from a light emitting unit and direction in which the bright spot is detected by a light receiving unit are changed, and an output which is generated by the light receiving unit when the bright spot or stripe and the view spot or slit visual field meet or intersect is employed as a timing signal to measure direction angles necessary in triangulation. The measured angle values are input to a computer such as a microcomputer to successively determine the positions of the measured points. Therefore, the shape of a workpiece portion to be welded or a weld line can successively be measured as the welding process progresses. To increase measuring accuracy, focus adjustment of the light receiving unit is effected by the following methods Welding arc light generally has a strong energy, but its spectrum is relatively uniformly distributed in a quite wide range. By using an optical bandpass filter which passes therethrough a narrow spectrum range covering the spectrum of signal light, the noise energy of the arc light is much reduced. Alternatively, a photodetector element having a high photodetecting sensitivity only around the spectrum of signal light may be employed. Time dependent variations of the welding arc light, though related to electric circuit constants of the welding machine, contain relatively low frequency components about 100 KHz or lower . Undesired measurement interference due to the welding arc light can be removed by modulating a measurement laser beam with a frequency higher than at least 50 KHz, for example 1 MHz, and demodulating an electric output from the photodetector element to determine whether the output contains a modulated component, for thereby ascertaining if the photodetector element has picked up a bright spot of the laser beam. By employing the above two methods, the measurement interference due to the welding arc light can substantially be prevented. The measurement signal light or laser beam may be modulated according to various modulation types such as simple pulse modulation, frequency modulation and the like providing that such modulation component would not be contained in the welding arc light. Further, according to the present invention, an optical system comprising a light emitting unit and a light receiving unit is arranged in one plane, a laser beam emitted from the light emitting unit is swung through a certain angle, a bright spot of the laser beam on a workpiece is observed by an array of photodetector elements of the light receiving unit successively at certain intervals of time, and bright spot positions are successively triangulated to find the coordinates of the bright spots in the coordinate system having a line connecting the light emitting unit and the light receiving unit and a line normal thereto serving as the axes of coordinates, respectively. A measurement head for use with a welding machine according to the present invention is arranged as follows The light emitting unit and the light receiving unit are mounted at a spaced interval on a body of the measurement head. The light emitting unit has a laser beam source for emitting a laser beam onto a measuring point on the surface of a workpiece, and the light receiving unit has an array of photodetector elements and a condenser lens for forming an image of a bright spot of the laser beam onto the array of photodetector elements. The laser beam should preferably have an optical output of a red or near infrared wavelength that can be detected against the spectral distribution of welding arc light, and laser beam being intensity modulated at a frequency higher than 50 KHz, for example. A bandpass filter is provided for picking up the modulation frequency component from the output of the photodetector element array of the light receiving unit. The photodetector element array should preferably be of such a small and lightweight one as an integrated photodiode array. To enable real time measurement during arc welding performed at a welding speed which is generally on the order of 2 m min., the light emitting unit causes a rotational oscillation mirror or a rotary mirror provided in the light emitting unit swing the emitted laser beam at high speed in said one plane in a direction normal to the weld line. Therefore, a locus of bright spot of the laser beam is formed on the surface of the workpiece. The light receiving unit detects the locus of the bright spot as separate bright spots lying on the locus at certain intervals. There is provided a means for determining an observation angle ϑ The measurement head of the present invention can measure a workpiece closely up to a welding point including a light scattering surface of a molten area in a workpiece portion to be welded in arc welding. The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which preferred embodiments of the present invention are shown by way of illustrative example. Prior to describing measurement heads for welding machines or robots according to the present invention, the prior art will first be described with reference to FIGS. 1 through 3. One conventional sensor system for enabling a welding torch to effect automatic arc welding is shown in FIG. 1, in which sheets of iron 11, 12 to be welded together are arranged in a transversely abutting relation to form an abutting line 13 along which the sheets 11, 12 will be welded. A welding torch 14 is disposed between the sheets 11, 12. A pair of electromagnetic sensors 15, 16 such as coils, for example, extends from the welding torch 14 toward the sheets 11, 12, respectively. Welding progresses while detecting the surface positions of the iron sheets 11, 12 by measuring the inductances of the sensors 15, 16. FIG. 2 shows another prior art called weaving method in which a welding torch 14 is swung alternately toward iron sheets 11, 12. If the welding torch 14 is weaved exactly symmetrically between the iron sheets 11, 12, as illustrated in FIG. 2A, then the arc current or voltage will vary in a symmetrical pattern when the welding torch 14 is swung alternately toward the iron plates 11, 12. If, however, the welding torch 14 is displaced toward the iron sheet 11, as shown in FIG. 2B, then the arc current or voltage will vary in an asymmetrical pattern as the welding torch 14 is swung alternately toward the iron plates 11, 12. The welding torch 14 can then be adjusted to a proper position while the welding is in progress by detecting the asymmetry in the waveform of the arc current or voltage. The methods shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 are of poor accuracy since the shape of the portion to be welded or weld line and the position of the welding torch with respect to the weld line are not numerically determined. Moreover, it is difficult to practice these two methods when the shape of the workpiece is irregular or the weld line has a steep curvature, or when the portion to be welded is located near the end portions of the workpiece. Therefore, these two methods cannot be employed for a fully automated welding robot. FIG. 3 illustrates another prior method which comprises the steps of emitting a slit beam, i.e., a fan beam of light 18 from a light emitting unit 17 onto iron sheets 11, 12 to be welded together, picking up the image of a bright stripe 19 formed on the iron sheets 11, 12 with an image camera 21, determining a weld line 13 from the picked up image of the bright stripe 19, and controlling a welding torch 14 to trace the weld line 13. With this prior method, however, it is difficult to discriminate the bright stripe 19 from the noise of the strong background light of the welding arc when the bright stripe 19 is formed near the welding portion, and weld line 13 cannot be determined with high accuracy. FIG. 4 is explanatory of the principle of measurement according to the present invention. A measurement head according to the present invention comprises a light emitting unit 22 and a light receiving unit 23, the optical axes of the light emitting unit 22 and the light receiving unit 23 lying in one plane. A laser beam 25 is emitted from the light emitting unit 22 onto a workpiece 24 and is swept in said one plane through a fixed angle Δϑ FIG. 5 shows the construction of a measurement head according to an embodiment of the present invention. The light emitting unit 22 and the light receiving unit 23 are disposed in a lower portion of a housing 32. The center O Lead wires connected to the photodetector elements of the array 29 are connected through a connector 48 to a circuit board 49. The circuit board 49 carries thereon a circuit required for measurement control and other circuits necessary for measurement described later . The housing 32 has an upper plate 32u on which there are mounted a control wire connector terminal 51, a detected signal terminal 52, a counter input terminal 53, a modulation input terminal 54, and a power supply connector terminal 55 which are connected to a processing unit described later . FIG. 6 illustrates a control circuit for the measurement head. A laser beam modulating signal f While the counter 59b in the scanning control counter 59 is counting 255 pulses of the output from the counter 59a, the mirror 38 angularly displaces the laser beam 25 in a direction from one of the left and right end detecting sensors 42, 43 to the other. While the counter 59b is counting one pulse, the scanning counter 62 counts 64 pulses of the clock CL₂, that is, CL₁, to scan the photodetector elements of the array 29 in one stroke. As shown in FIG. 8, the measurement control logic circuit 61 has terminals 65, 66, 67 supplied respectively with the beam moving direction indication signal DI FIG. 7A , the output pulse FIG. 7C from the left end detecting sensor 42, and the output pulse FIG. 7D from the right end detecting sensor 43. When the output pulse from the sensor 42 is applied to the terminal 66 while the beam moving direction indication signal DI is of a logic 1 level, an AND gate 68 produces an output pulse which is applied through an OR gate 69 to a flip flop 71 to set the latter, whereupon the flip flop 71 produces a measurement range signal MA FIG. 7E of a logic 1 level at a terminal 77. When the output pulse from the sensor 43 is then applied to the terminal 67, an AND gate 72 issues an output pulse through an OR gate 73 to the flip flop 71 to reset the latter. The flip flop 71 is now reset to cause the measurement range signal MA to be of a logic 0 level. When the output pulse from the sensor 43 is applied to the terminal 67 while the beam moving direction indication signal DI is of a logic 0 level, an AND gate 74 produces an output pulse which is applied through the OR gate 69 to the flip flop 71 to set the latter, whereupon the measurement range signal MA has a logic 1 level. When the output pulse from the sensor 42 is then applied to the terminal 66, an AND gate 75 issues an output pulse through the OR gate 73 to the flip flop 71 to reset the latter. The measurement range signal MA now has a logic 0 level. As long as the mirror 38 swings back and forth at a constant speed without an error, the counter 59b in the scanning control counter 59 will start counting pulses at a time t₁ in FIG. 7 in response to detection by the left end detecting sensor 42, and the counter 59b will have counted a predetermined number n However, there are sometimes differences in time between the detection of an end of the measurement range and completion of counting of the number of pulses by the counter 59 due for example to variations in the driving current for the mirror 38. Such time differences may cause measurement errors. The measurement errors thus produced can be eliminated by an angle error correction circuit 76 which is constructed as shown in FIG. 9 and will operate as shown in the timing chart of FIG. 10. As shown in FIG. 10A, the beam moving direction indication signal DI first has a logic 1 level to turn the mirror 38. When the laser beam 25 swings past the first sensor 42 to generate a pulse at the time t₁ as shown in FIG. 10B, the measurement range signal MA becomes a logic 1 level as shown in FIG. 10D and is fed from the measurement control logic circuit 61 in FIG. 6, that is, from the Q output of the flip flop 71 in FIG. 8, to an error detection logic circuit 78 via the terminal 77 shown in FIG. 9. The measurement range signal MA applied to the terminal 77 is fed to AND gates 81, 82 through an error detecting logic circuit 78 to open the gates 81, 82 during the measurement range signal MA assumes a logic 1 level. The gates 81, 82 are also supplied with the control clock CL₁ from the clock counter 57 shown in FIG. 6 and Q and When the laser beam 25 is detected by the sensor 43 at a time t₄ as shown in FIG. 10C, the logic level of the measurement range signal MA becomes 0 as shown in FIG. 10D. A time difference Δt between the time t₄ and a time t₅ when the angle signal counter 59b completes its counting operation is detected at an XOR gate 78₂ by exclusive ORing the signal MA FIG. 10D and the output signal from the gate 78₁ FIG. 10I . The output from the XOR gate 78₂ is supplied through an AND gate 78₃ to an AND gate 89 to determine the period Δt FIG. 10J during which the clock CL₁ to be counted by the memory counter 86 passes through the gate 89. The same reset signal RS FIG. 7G as the one applied to the counters 59a, 59b is also applied to a flip flop 78₄ so that the output of the flip flop 78₄ closes the gate 78₃ until the output of the gate 78₁ becomes 1 . In the example of the operation shown in FIG. 10, the sensor 43 detects the laser beam swung by the mirror 38 earlier than the counter 59b finishes it counting operation, and hence falling edge of the counting operation FIG. 10I occurs later than the falling edge of the measurement range signal MA. The measurement range signal MA is also applied to a control terminal U D of the memory counter 86 to control the latter to operate in an upcounting mode when the measurement range signal MA is of a logic 1 level and in a downcounting mode when the measurement range signal MA is of a logic 0 level. In the illustrated embodiment, the memory counter 86 is in the downcounting mode after the time t₄ to downcount the clock FIG. 10K having passed through the gate 89 until the count in the counter 59b becomes zero and, as a result, the count in the memory counter 86 decreases from 8 to 6 . The memory counter 86 has been set to a reference count, 8 in the embodiment of FIG. 10, under an initial condition. When the counting operation of the counter 59b is slower than the swinging operation of the mirror 38, that is, when the fall of the signal shown in FIG. 10I is preceded by the fall of the measurement range signal MA, the memory counter 86 is in the downcounting mode to reduce the count in the memory counter 86 by the pulse number of the clock CL₁ dependent on the time difference Δt. The foregoing operation is performed in the former half of a reciprocating cycle of the mirror movement. In the latter half of the cycle, the coincidence circuit 87 produces a coincidence output when the count in the counter 85 coincides with the count, here 6 , set in the memory counter 86. The repeated counting operations of the counters 59a, 85 are shortened, and the operation of the angle signal counter 59b is completed in a shorter stroke. The operation is basically the same when the mirror movement goes from the latter half of one swinging cycle to the former half of a next swinging cycle. If the counting operation of the counter 59b is faster than the mirror movement, that is, when the fall of the signal shown in FIG. 10I is succeeded by the fall of the measurement range signal MA, then the memory counter 86 counts the clock CL₁ in the upcounting mode since a logic 1 level is applied to the control terminal U D of the memory counter 86. The repeated counting operations of the counters 59a, 85 are slowed down, and the operation of the angle signal counter 59b is completed in a longer stroke. In this manner, the count in the memory counter 86 is automatically set to such a value that causes to minimize the time difference Δt in each half period of one swinging cycle of the mirror 38. Referring back to FIG. 6, the clock CL₂ applied to the counter 59a is also applied to the scanning counter 62 which produces an output to render analog switches of the changeover switch circuit 63 successively conductive for scanning the photodetector element array 29 comprising the photodetector elements arrayed at fixed intervals. The period at which the photodetector element array 29 is scanned and the frequency at which the laser beam 25 is modulated are related to each other such that three or more, for example, modulated waves will be present in the output from each photodetector element in the array 29. In this respect, it is desirable to select the frequency of the modulation signal to be higher than 200 KHz. This selection is sufficient to remove any adverse influences due to sparks and other noises during welding and is effective to decrease intervals of the measurement points and increase the accuracy of detection of the rising edges of signals, that is, the received light component 27 of the diffused laser beam reflected from the bright spot. The output from each photodetector element produced as the output from the changeover switch circuit 63 is amplified by an amplifier 64 to an appropriate level, and then supplied to a narrow bandpass filter 91 for signals and a bandpass filter 92 for noises. The amplifier 64 has an amplifying frequency range of from 0.1 to 10 MHz, for example, the narrow bandpass filter 91 has a pass band 2Δf where A As an example, as shown in FIG. 13, a step S₁ determines whether the measurement range signal MA is of a logic 1 level or not. When the left or right end detecting sensor 42, 43 senses the laser beam 25, the measurement range signal MA FIG. 10 becomes a logic 1 level, and the count in a k counter 99 in the processing unit 97 is set to k 0 in a step S₂. In step S₃, it is determined whether all of the data of the beam angle signal BA 8 bits , a received light demodulation signal DS 64 bits , and the beam moving direction indication signal DI have been fetched into the processing unit 97. When the signals BA, DS, DI have been fetched, in step S₄, the number The counter 59b shown in FIG. 9 may comprise a reversible counter which can be switched into an upcounting or downcounting mode dependent on whether the beam moving direction indiction signal DI is of 1 or 0 in logic level. Processing operation of the processing unit 97 for such a modification is illustrated in FIG. 14, and its detailed description will be omitted. In the case of welding a V shaped portion of the workpiece 24 as shown in FIG. 3, it is desirable to determine the accurate location of the deepest position in the valley. By swinging the laser beam 25 across the valley, it is possible to form a bright spot at the deepest position of the valley at a certain instance. However, the image of the bright spot at the deepest position is not necessarily formed on any one of the photodetector elements of the array 29. Such a bright spot position at the time when a bright spot image is focused between two adjacent photodetector elements of the array 29 can be determined by storing the coordinates a, h of a plurality of bright spot images focused on the photodetector elements successively into the processing unit 97 and then plotting regression curves of these coordinates a, h . For example, the coordinates a The differences The measuring accuracy could be increased by arranging the photodetector elements of the array 29 at fixed intervals with a high packing density. However, it would be difficult to increase a light receiving area of each photodetector element while arranging the photodetector elements in a high packing density due to structural limitations of the array 29. FIG. 18 shows an array 29 of photodetector elements mounted on a reciprocating unit 110 designed for solving such a drawback. A pulley 202 is mounted on a rotatable shaft of a step motor 201. A pulley 204 is mounted on a shaft of an encoder 203 for detecting rotational angles of the step motor 201. A steel belt 205 is trained around the pulleys 202, 204. A carriage 206 is reciprocally moved by the steel belt 205 in the directions of the arrowheads while being guided by guide rods 207 supported between a pair of support arms 208. The carriage 206 supports thereon an array 29 of n As described before, the laser beam emitted is intensity modulated at a frequency higher than 50 KHz, preferably higher than 100 KHz. Since the surface of the workpiece to be welded has an optical property approximating isotropic scattering, any bright spot image can be picked up with substantially equal optical intensities in any directions even though the bright spot itself has a low degree of brightness. The bright spot image is focused by the lens 28 onto the photodetector element array 29. The photodetector element array 29 converts the received light into an electric signal containing the modulated wave, which is subjected to demodulation. Upon detection of the modulated wave, it is determined which photodetector element has detected the bright spot image in the manner described above. Experiments have confirmed that because the fluctuation in intensity of welding arc light contains almost no frequency components of 100 KHz or higher as will be explained next, unwanted interference due to arc light noise can be removed by picking up the modulated frequency component with a narrow bandpass filter. The arc light from iron has a wide range of wavelengths from 200 to 1,500 nm. Using an optical filter having a pass band in a wavelength range longer than 550 nm including the wavelength of the laser beam, the level of arc light components mixed as noise in the received light has been sufficiently reduced in comparison with the level of the received signal light of the diffused laser beam. It has been also confirmed that photodiodes such as of silicon or germanium have upwardly convex wavelength characteristics capable of filtering action and have a sufficiently small sensitivity for light of a wavelength of 500 nm or shorter, and requires no optical filter under normal conditions. An example of the specifications of the measurement head of the present invention is given in the following table The measurement head coacts with the welding torch to move at a constant speed along a weld line 13, as shown in FIG. 20A, while a laser beam is swept at a front arc edge on the welding surface, to thereby form a trail 0 1 2 3 ... of a laser beam bright spot. As an example, the amplitude of reciprocating scanning movement of the bright spot is 128 mm, and the measurement head moves along the weld line 13 a distance of 4 mm while the bright spot makes one reciprocating movement across the distance of 128 mm in which 64 measurements are made at a pitch of 2 mm. In FIG. 20B, the front arc edge on the welding surface is scanned back and forth by a laser beam bright spot at a constant speed along a sawtooth like path through 0 to 1, 1 to 2, 2 to 3, ..., while, the returns through 1 to 1 , 2 to 2 , and so on are each made in a negligibly short period. The measurement head moves a distance of 2 mm while the bright spot moves in one reciprocating stroke. Thus, the weld line is being monitored at a speed which is one half the speed in the example of FIG. 20A. Selection of the scanning patterns of FIGS. 20A and 20B depends on the kind, size and other factors of the workpiece 24. FIG. 20C shows a V shaped cross section of a portion across the weld line 13 of the workpiece 24 and also illustrates the relationship between the laser beam 25 and their left and right end bright spots A One experimental example for sensing a bright spot during arc welding under the following conditions will be described When the mirror is rotatingly oscillated at a constant speed with a triangular wave TRI of 12 Hz to swing the laser beam back and forth, the sensed output from one photodetector element of the array 29 can be measured as modulated waveform as illustrated in FIG. 22. The measured waveform is then demodulated and passed through a band pass filter and subjected to the foregoing computation, so that the bright spot position can accurately be measured even with arc light being given off. The measuring conditions are the same as those in FIG. 21B. The resolving power of the measurement head is related to the magnification of the lens 28 and the pitch of the photodetector element array 29. The resolving power becomes greater as the lens magnification β becomes larger and as the pitch becomes smaller. However, as the lens size becomes larger, the measurement range becomes smaller. For a measurement head requiring a higher accuracy, it is preferable to employ the arrangement of FIG. 18 using, as a drive means, a step motor for transversely moving the photodetector element array 29 by steps of a small distance corresponding to an element to element pitch divided by m m is an integer greater than one . As can be understood from the above description, the present invention resides in that the light emitting unit 22 and the light receiving unit 23 are mounted on the measurement head body 32, the light beam 25 emitted from the light emitting unit 22 is projected on the surface of the workpiece 24, and the image of the bright spot 26 produced where the light beam hits the workpiece 24 is picked up by the light receiving unit 23 as shown in FIG. 23. The detection of the position of the bright spot 26 is based on triangulation using the given distance d between the center O The measurement head body 32 has fixed coordinate axes ξ, η, ζ as shown in FIG. 24. When a bright spot A₁ on the surface of the workpiece 24 is detected by the light receiving unit at a certain instance, the equations will be determined which find the position of the bright spot A₁ and the position of a point A FIG. 25 shows an arrangement similar to the foregoing arrangement, in which a measurement head has a pair of light receiving units 23a, 23b disposed one on each side of a single light emitting unit 22 at equal distances The image of a bright spot A 26 is formed at According to this arrangement, the positions of the bright spot and the image forming plane can be determined through simple computations from the positions of the photodetector elements detecting the images of the bright spot in the light receiving units 23a, 23b without using the angle of the light beam emitted from the light emitting unit. The manner in which the light receiving unit forms the image of a bright spot on an object to be measured is shown in FIG. 27. In FIG. 27, a lens 28 has an optical axis coinciding with an r axis of a coordinate system p, q, r and p and q axes lie in a central plane of the lens 28. Assuming that a bright spot has coordinates p₁, q₁, r₁, and its image where r When the bright spot A₁ moves on the surface of the object as the direction of the light beam 25 is changed, the image The image By selecting r₁, r Processes of adjusting the focus of the light receiving unit, that is, bringing a focused image forming plane into coincidence with the plane of the photodetector elements, will be described. The image formed in the light receiving unit by the bright spot A It is convenient to use, as the auxiliary light beam L FIGS. 30A through 30E illustrate types of signal light that can be used for measurement, that is, light emission types. In each of these figures, light is radiated from a point O FIG. 30A A single light beam Ls falls on the surface J of an object to be measured to form a bright spot α. FIG. 30B A plurality of light beam Ls τ FIG. 30C A plurality of light beams Ls µ FIG. 30D A light beam Ls t emanating from a point O FIG. 30E A slit light beam expressed by Lsp is emitted from a point O FIGS. 31A through 31D illustrate light reception types of the light receiving unit that can be used for measurement. FIG. 31A A light receiving unit is designed to pick up one point on the surface of an object to be measured. Where the light receiving unit is composed of a lens and one spot like photodetector element disposed on an optical axis of the lens, a straight line connecting the photodetector element, the center of the lens and the point on the surface serves as a view line Lr of the light receiving unit. A point where the view line Lr intersects the surface of the object is referred to as a view spot indicated by β. FIG. 31B A plurality of lines of view Lr τ₁ , Lr τ₂ , ... Lr τ FIG. 31C A line of view Lr t passes through a point O FIG. 31D A light receiving unit has a slit of visual field in the form of a fan shaped plane passing through a point O Arrangements for implementing the above light reception types are as follows For the type shown in FIG. 31A, a single photodetector element is placed on the position r Measurement by triangulation through the use of a single light emitting unit and a single light receiving unit can be achieved by finding the position of a point of intersection of a bright spot an array of bright spots, a locus of a bright spot or a bright stripe produced on the object surface J by the light emitting unit and a view spot an array of view spots, a locus of a view spot or a visual field line formed on the object surface J by the light receiving unit. FIG. 33 is illustrative of the relationships between photodetector elements on an image forming plane and images in the light receiving unit with respect to various combinations between light reception types indicated in a horizontal row and light emission types in a vertical column. Since the measurement head is arranged such that a detector element and a bright spot image intersect each other at a certain instance, the bright spot position on the surface of the object can be computed by employing an output from the photodetector element positioned in the point of intersection, determining the direction of a view line from the position of the photodetector element, or by employing the output from the photodetector element as a timing signal and determining the direction of the projected light beam and the direction of the view line. The matrix of figures in FIG. 33 is numbered 1.1, 1.2, ... 2.1, 2.2, ... 5.4, in which each small circle represents one photodetector element, a bidirectional arrow with a circle thereon a locus of a moving photodetector element, a cross an image of a bright spot, a bidirectional arrow with a cross thereon a locus of a moving image of a bright spot, and a span of line an image of a bright stripe. The figures 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2 are of no practical value as it is difficult to find a point of intersection between an element detecting light and the image. The types illustrated in the other figures can be realized through appropriated constructions. Examples of such constructions will be described. Combinations of light emission and light reception types that can be put to use based on the foregoing consideration will be described by way of example. In the following drawings, a plane containing a ξ, ζ axis of a measurement head body is indicated by Sb, axes passing through O A light beam Ls and a view line Lr are placed in the plane Sb. In FIG. 34A, Ls is normal to ξ axis, and a view spot β follows a bright spot α. In FIG. 34B, Lr is normal to ξ axis, and the bright spot α follows the view spot β. It would be troublesome to superpose the spots α, β by letting them follow one another. The cross sectional shape of an object to be measured can be determined by rotating the entire measurement head about the ξ axis, or about the η Since it would be troublesome to let the view spot or the bright spot follow the bright spot or the view spot in Example 1, one of the directions of the light beam Ls and the view line Lr is fixed with respect to the ξ axis, the angle of the other with respect to the ξ axis is changed in the plane Sb according to a periodic function ϑ t of time, and ϑ t is determined by using as a timing signal a signal produced by a photodetector element when the view spot and the bright spot are superposed. Ls and Lr lie in the plane Sb at all times. In FIG. 35, the angle ϑ The light beam Ls is normal to ξ axis, and a slit visual field Lsp is selected as follows In FIG. 37A, Lrp is selected to lie in a plane containing the η Lr is normal to ξ axis, and a slit light beam Lsp is rotated about the η A plane of a moving view line Lr t and an array of light beams Ls τ A plane of a moving light beam Ls t and an array of view lines Lr τ A slit visual field Lrp and an array of light beams Ls τ A plane of a moving light beam Ls t and a plane of a moving view line Lr t are disposed in the plane Sb. The repetition periods at which the direction ϑ A plane of a moving light beam Ls t and a slit visual field Lrp are used. In FIG. 43A, Ls t and Lrp are disposed in the plane Sb. The direction ϑ A slit light beam Lsp and an array of view lines Lr τ A slit light beam Lsp and a plane of a moving view line Lr t are employed. In FIGS. 45A, B, Lsp and Lr t lie in planes containing the η A slit light beam Lsp and a slit visual field Lrp are employed. In FIG. 46A, Lsp and Lrp lie in planes containing the η A single plane of a moving light beam Ls t and a pair of slit visual fields Lrp , Lrp are disposed in the same plane Sb. No detailed description will be given here since this type has been discussed above in detail. It is necessary to determine the positions of the photodetector elements in the both element arrays which generate signal outputs approximately at the same timing. To this end, the photodetector elements should be arranged in a sufficiently high packing density and the output terminals of the photodetector elements should be swept at a sufficiently high speed to determine the position of the photodetector elements. Alternatively, where the packing density of the photodetector elements is not sufficiently high, the position of the bright spot should be determined by interpolation based on the two successive signal outputs from the two light receiving units. Measurement system constructions and measurement processes differ dependent on the light emission types and light reception types described above. They are however similar to each other in their basic idea and specific measuring methods, and will hereinafter be described. Measuring circuit example 1, FIG. 47 This measuring circuit employs the moving light beam Ls t and the moving view line Lr t shown in FIG. 42, and has an optical band pass filter placed in front of the light receiving unit for allowing passage of signal light. An auxiliary light beam L In the measuring circuit shown in FIG. 47, the light modulated with µ Assuming that ϑ When the output from the photodetector element S is demodulated by demodulators 105s, 105f, the arc noise component is almost entirely eliminated, and the demodulators 105s, 105f produces V The modulated component V When the values of ϑ In the case where the auxiliary beam of light L An example of specifications for conducting measurement of 20 cm width on the surface of a workpiece to be welded will be such that a measuring interval in the widthwise direction is 0.2 cm, the number of points to be measured is 20 0.2 100, the time required for measuring the width of 20 cm is 0.2 sec., the diameter of a light beam is 0.02 cm, the lens of the light receiving unit has a focal length of 4 cm, the measurement head and the workpiece are spaced a distance of 50 cm, the view spot moves on the surface J at a speed of 100 cm sec., the bright spot moves on the surface J at a speed 10⁴ cm sec., the time period in which the bright spot and the view spot are superposed is 4.04 µsec., and the frequency at which to modulate the light beam is 2.475 MHz. Since about ten cycles of wave are contained in the time in which the bright spot and the view spot are superposed, the modulated wave can sufficiently be detected. The time allowed for the processing unit microcomputer 111 to effect computation for one point is 1.6 10 ³ sec., and hence a sufficient computing time is ensured. A measuring circuit for the paired light receiving unit measurement head shown in FIG. 25 FIG. 26 is shown in FIG. 49. The light beam is modulated in the same manner as that of the previous example 2. Output terminals of each of the light receiving units 23a and 23b are constructed as shown in FIG. 50. A changeover switch 121 is controlled by a switch control circuit 122 for successively switching output signals from the photodetector element array 29 at a high sped and applying the output signals to a demodulator 105. Discriminators 123 , 123 determine whether modulated components are contained in the demodulated outputs, and generate sampling pulses only when the demodulated outputs contain modulated components. A switch controller 122 controls switching operation of the terminals of changeover switches 121 , 121 and issues the terminal numbers of turned on switches in the switches 121 , 121 to a terminal number generator 124. The sampling pulses generated when the discriminators 123 , 123 detect modulated components are used by the terminal number generator 124 to sample the terminal numbers and issue the sampled terminal numbers to the processing unit 111. The terminal numbers correspond to the positions of the photodetector elements, and hence to x Since the changeover switch must pick up an output signal from any one of the photodetector elements while an image of a bright spot is passing over that photodetector element, the changeover switch is required to sweep the terminals of all photodetector elements in one sequence within a period of time in which an image of the bright spot dwells on one photodetector element. The bright spot and the view spot are not necessarily superposed simultaneously in both the light receiving units 23a and 23b. To cope with this, the two detected signals from the respective light receiving units 23a, 23b each representing superposition of the bright spot and the view spot are fed in a time sequence to the processing unit 111, the simultaneous positions of the images of the bright spot in the respective light receiving units 23a, 23b are determined by interpolation, approximated values of x FIG. 51 shows an example of arrangement of the measurement head employing the measurement principle shown in FIG. 45A. Since the optical geometry defined in FIG. 51 is substantially identical with that of FIG. 45A, detailed explanation thereof will be omitted. As shown in FIG. 51, the axis ξ of the head is placed above the weld line 13, for example, almost in parallel thereto. The angle ϑ In the case of ϑ Thus, the case becomes identical with that shown in FIG. 45B. FIG. 52 shows an example of an embodiment in which rotational oscillation mirrors are employed in the light emitting unit 22 and the light receiving unit 23. In FIG. 52 the light emitting unit 22 comprises a rotational oscillation mirror 131 having its center disposed at O Although certain preferred embodiments have been shown and described, it should be understood that many changes and modifications may be made therein without departing from the scope of the appended claims.
