# BURNING TABLE

## Abstract
The table comprises a water tank 16 with sloping bottom panels 24 running into a trough 30 which slopes down to a slag collection bin 34 at one end. The trough is resiliently attached to the tank by connectors 92 and sealing strips 100 . A submerged grid is formed from intersecting steel bars 44, 46 notched at their intersections to receive upright support elements 64 in the form of lengths of thin walled copper tubing standing on the grid with their upper ends normally a little above the water level. Damaged support elements 64 are individually reversible or replace able and the support elements allow slag to drop through to the trough 30 which is oscillated by a vibrating mechanism to convey the slag to the bin 34 . The array of elements 64 supports even small pieces cut from the workpiece on the table.
