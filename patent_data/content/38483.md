# Heat treating of material in finely divided form.

## Abstract
Heat treatment of a material, e.g. a finely divided resin, wherein the material is introduced into a drum and agitated by rotating, spaced blades which whirl the material into a dispersion. The action of the blades heats the resin particles so that heat for the heat treatment is provided. The heat treatment can be, e.g. to cause small resin particles to coalesce with largar particles in the processing of polyethylene reactor flake, to improve flowability of the resin, or to admix resin and additive. To obtain increased capacity while the size of the apparatus is maintained within reasonable limits, two intersecting, genarally cylindrical drums, each outfitted with man agitator, are used. Apparently the dispersions of the respective agitators slam into each other in the vicinity of the intersection causing additional heating.
