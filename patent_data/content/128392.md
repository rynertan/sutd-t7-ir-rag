# A separator device for the separation of the components of edible meals or the like.

## Abstract
The separator device comprises a vertical cylindrical container 4 provided at its the bottom with a discharge rotary valve 9 . A feeding duct 5 extends axially into the top portion of the container, and swirling means are provided so that the meal to be treated will reach with a whirling flow the central portion of a distributing chamber 31 which is provided with equispaced lateral openings 32 wherefrom equal spiral shaped tubes 33 protrude out wards with the same curvature, whereby the meal is dis charged tangentially onto the periphery of an underlying horizontal disch 6 which is arranged co axially in the up per portion of the container 4 . Arranged at a suitable distance above said disc there is a horizontal partition 1 which is fixed to said container and is sealingly traversed by said curved feeding tubes 33 . At the center of the disc 6 there is formed an opening 10 connected to an underlying duct 11 which is sealingly passed outwards through the container 4 and is connected to a suction source. Inside the container 4 below the disc 6 there opens one conduit 15 communicating with the atmosphere.
