# Method and apparatus for splicing packing material webs.

## Abstract
A method for splicing the trailing end portion of an advancing web 5 of packing material to the leading end portion of an initially stationary second web 105 of the same packing material such that after splicing marks 31 provided on each of the webs in an equally spaced relation continue as an uninterrupted regular row, in particular in a packing machine, in which the first web 5 runs over a roller 16 and the leading end portion 105 provided with an adhesive of the second web 105 is placed over a second roller 116 opposite the first roller. Upon passing a predeter mined point 21 by the trailing end of the first web 5 an initiating signal is exited and supplied to a controlling device for conditioning this and upon passing a predetermined point 30 by a mark 31 on the first web 5 a signal is generated by which the conditioned controlling device delivers a command to a displacing device 29, 23, 24, 25 for its operation, by which said rollers 16, 116 are pressed against each other and the splicing is carried out. The period of time t is determined between the actuation of the displacing device 23, 24, 25 and the mutual engagement of said rollers, and between the signal generated by a mark 31 and the command from the controlling device a lapse of time Tn t is set, in which Tn is obtained by dividing at least one spacing between two subsequent marks 31 by the velocity of the first web 5 .
