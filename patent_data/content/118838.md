The reaction mixture was poured into cold diisopropyl ether 60 ml and the resulting precipitate was collected by filtration. The precipitate was dissolved in a solution of sodium bicarbonate 892 mg in water 40 ml , washed with ethyl acetate and a mixture of ethyl acetate 25 ml and tetrahydrofuran 25 ml was added thereto.The mixture was adjusted to pH 4.5 with 6N hydrochloric acid and the aqueous layer was separated out. The aqueous solution was adjusted to pH 3 with 6N hydrochloric acid and extracted with a mixed solvent of ethyl acetate and tetrahydrofuran 1 1 . The extract was washed with brine, dried over magnesium sulfate and concentrated to small volume. The resulting precipitate was collected by filtration, washed with diethyl ether and dried to give 7 2 5 amino 1,2,4 thiadiazol 3 yl 2 1 carboxy 1 methylpropoxyimino acetamido 3 4 carboxy 3 hydroxyisothiazol 5 yl thiomethyl3 3 cephem4 carboxylic acid syn isomer 1.03 g . mp 207 to 210 C dec.
