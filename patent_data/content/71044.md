# ELECTROGRAPHIC COATING CONTAINING AQUEOUS EMULSION COPOLYMERIZED ACRYLAMIDE COPOLYMERS

## Abstract
Electrically conductive paper is coated with an insulating coating which is an aqueous latex of an aqueous emulsion copolymer of monethylenically unsaturated monomers com prising from 5 to 40 of copolymerized acrylamide or a monoethylenic derivative thereof, preferably isobutoxy methyl acrylamide. A proportion of monoethylenically un saturated carboxylic acid is preferably included in the copolymer.
