# Electro optic modulator and use of the same.

## Abstract
Apparatus for converting an electronic signal pattern which comprises a plurality of electronic signals into an image comprising a line of light, with a light intensity profile determined by the electronic signal pattern to achieve a visible display of the signal pattern. A total internal reflection TIR type of electro optic modulator 29 which has each of a set of electrodes 31 individually addressed is utilized. To record the displayed signal pattern, the output of the electro optic modulator is imaged as a line onto a recording plane 68 so that each individually addressed electrode acts as a light modulator or gate for one picture element along the recording line.
