# Electric brake controller.

## Abstract
A control circuit 10 for regulating the application and release of brake force in an electric brake. A pulse width modulator 34 presents an output signal of regulatable duty cycle to power drivers 18 20 connected to the electric mo tors 12 of the brake. A control circuit 26 regulates the di rection of current flow through the motors to achieve either brake application or brake release. The output of the pulse width modulator is set by the position of the brake pedal or by a signal which is a function of the correlation between brake torque and the position of the brake pedal. whichever is lar ger.
