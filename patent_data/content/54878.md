# Suction control device for an endoscope.

## Abstract
A suction control device of an endoscope comprises an outer cylinder 60 connected with a channel 27 at one end and having an opening at the other end, an inner cylinder 46 opening at either end and inserted in the outer cylinder 60 so as to be able to move axially between a first position on one end side of the outer cylinder 60 and a second position on the other end side of the outer cylinder 60 , thereby forming an annular space defined between the inner cylinder 46 and the outer cylinder 60 , a first rugged ring 55 formed on one end of the inner cylinder 46 , a second rugged ring 56 formed on the inner peripheral surface of the outer cylinder 60 so as to come closely in contact with the first rugged ring 55 to cut off the communication between the space 47 and the channel 27 when the inner cylinder 46 is moved to the first position, and a coupling piece 45 disposed on the other end of the outer cylinder 60 so as to cut off the space 47 from the atmosphere and supporting the inner cylinder 46 so as to allow the space 47 to communicate with the channel 27 . A suction tube 35 is connected with the space 47 between the coupling piece 45 and the first rugged ring 55 , the outer cylin der having a communication hole 48 for connecting the space 47 with the atmosphere between the cou pling piece 45 and the first rugged ring 55 .
