## Description
APPARATUS FOR TRANSPORTING PARTICLES OF MAGNETICALLY SUSCEPTING MATERIAL. rhis invention relates to apparatus for transporting particles of magnetically suscepting material along a path. In the manufacture and use of particles of magnetically suscepting material it is sometimes necessary to transport the material from one position to another, as for example from the place of manufacture to a storage bin, or from a storage bin to a place where the particles are used. It is an object of the invention to provide apparatus for readily transporting such materials. According to the present invention, apparatus for transporting particles of magnetically suscepting material comprises means providing a path for the particles to be transported and at least one electric linear thrust device associated with the path and arranged, when energised, to displace the particles along aid path. The means providing the path is conveniently in the form of a channel with the base of the channel constituted by a flat surface which may be a flat surface of the linear thrust device or a plate positioned close to the flat surface of the linear thrust device. The plate may be of magnetically inert material such as a plastics material, e.g.polycarbonate. The atmosphere around the path will usually be air but it may contain an atmosphere of other gaseous material, for example, a non oxidising gas. Alternatively, the path may be filled with a liquid and the particles are caused to move through the liquid and along the path. Examples of magnetically suscepting materials which can be transported are ferrous powder, low alloy steel powder, powders of cobalt containing alloys, and powders of other magnetic alloys. The apparatus can be used to separate particles of magnetically suscepting materials from a mixture of magnetically suscepting particles and non magnetically suscepting particles. For example, during the manufacture of high speed steel powder by an atomisation process, the powder so formed is contaminated by particles of refractory material from the atomising vessel. The apparatus may be used to separate the particles of high speed steel from the particles of refractory contaminant. Another example is the use of the apparatus to separate grinding swarf from particles removed from a grinding wheel during a grinding operation. When a magnetically suscepting material is ground on a grinding wheel, the swarf of the magnetically suscepting material which is produced could be re used to advantage but it contains particles removed from the grinding wheel. Since the grinding wheel particles are of a non magnetically suscepting material, the apparatus of the present invention can be used to separate these particles from those of the grinding swarf. In order that the invention may be more readily understood it will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a diagrammatic side view of powder transporting apparatus in accordance with one embodiment of the invention, Figure 2 is a section on the line A A of Figure 1, and Figure 3 is a side elevation, partly in section of powder separating apparatus in accordance with a second embodiment of the invention. Referring to Figures 1 and 2, an electric linear thrust device 1 is of elongate form and has its windings embedded in a protective resin coating which provides a flat upper surface 3. A pair of elongate members 5, conveniently of perspex, are arranged in side by side spaced apart relation on a plate 6 to constitute a path in the form of a channel 7. The plate 6 may be of perspex or other magnetically inert material. The plate is positioned in spaced relation from the surface 3 of the thrust device to form an air gap 8 between them. The channel 7 may be open at its top but it is preferably closed by a plate 9. plate 9. A feed device indicated by reference 11 serves to deposit particles of a magnetically suscepting material 13 into one end of the channel. The electrical connections to the linear thrust device are not shown. The supply is preferably a 3 phase supply but a single phase supply with a capacitor present in one phase could be used. In use, the device produces a linear thrust acting along the length of the device. If, for example, an aluminium plate was placed on the device, the plate would be displaced in the direction of the linear thrust. The thrust is indicated by the arrow 15 in Figure 1. With the particulate material, however, any magnetic suscepting particles, such as particles of ferrous materials, which are applied to the linear device are displaced along the device in the direction opposite to the direction of the linear thrust.The particles thus move in the direction indicated by the arrow 17 in Figure 1, from one end of the path to the other. The apparatus thus serves to transport magnetically suscepting material from one end of the path to the other. For some materials it has been found that the plate 6 and the air gap 8 are not required. For example, stainless steel powder can be transported along a plate with zero air gap or with the particles moving in contact with the flat face 3 of the linear thrust device. However, to transport high speed steel particles an air gap of 5 10 mm is desirable and for low alloy steel an air gap of from 15 20 mm is suitable. The atmosphere in path 7 will usually be air but any other gas, e.g. a reducing gas, can be used.Alternatively, the particles may be applied to the path in a liquid slurry and particles of magnetically suscepting material are drawn out of the slurry and transported along the path. The apparatus shown in Figures 1 and 2 can be inverted, i.e. with the linear thrust device positioned above the plate 6, and the particulate material then travels on the underside of the plate 6. In Figure 3, apparatus is shown which is suitable for separating particles of magnetically suscepting and non suscepting materials. An elongate electric linear thrust device 21 is mounted on the underside of the top support member 23 of a generally rectangular framework 25, so that the flat face 27 of the device is substantially horizontal and facing downwardly. A plate 29 of magnetically inert material is supported from the support member 23 below the face 27 of the device. The plate has a generally straight portion 31 followed by a downwardly curved portion 33. The portion 29 is inclined downwardly with respect to the face 27 so that there is a smaller air gap between the plate and the face at the left hand end of the portion 31 than there is at the right hand end.The supports for the plate 29 are such that the air gap between the plate and the face 27 can be adjusted along the length of the plate. The plate 29 is contained within an enclosure 35 having two outlets 37 and 39 respectively to which removable hoppers 38 and 40 are fastened A vibratory feed device for particulate material has a hopper 41 from which the particulate material is deposited on to a channel member 43. The channel member is vibrated by means indicated by reference numeral 45. One end of the channel 43 projects through an opening in the enclosure 35 to a position below the plate 29. If a mixture of magnetically suscepting and non suscepting particles are placed in the hopper 41, the feed device causes the particles to pass along the channel member and into the enclosure 35. With the linear thrust device energised, the particles of magnetically suscepting materials move upwardly from the end of the channel 43 on to the underside of the plate 29. Most of the particles of non magnetically suscepting material will fall off the end of the channel 43 into the enclosure 35 and be collected in the bin 38, but some will be carried up with the other particles on to the plate 29. The particles drawn on to the plate are transported along its underside towards the portion 33 of the plate. As the particles are displaced along the plate, the air gap between the plate and the thrust device increases and these particles of non magnetically suscepting material soon drop off the plate into the bin 38. The other particles however continue to travel along the underside of the plate towards the portion 33 and eventually, either before or after they reach the portion 33, they drop off into the bin 40 thereby separating them from the particles collected in the bin 38. The last pole of the linear thrust device at the right hand end of the device shown in Figure 3 may be wound in antiphase to the other poles or alternatively the last pole may be periodically pulsed in order to throw the particles off the plate 29. An example of the apparatus shown in Figure 3 is as follows Linear thrust device 46 cm long, type A84 415V 3 ph 50 c s manufactured by Linear Motors Limited, Loughborough, England. Air gap at input end of thrust device 4 8 mm. Air gap at output end of thrust device 20 mm. Pick up height from channel 43 to plate 29 5 30 mm. With this apparatus high speed steel powder M2 can be separated from a mixture of this powder and refractory particles at a rate of about 10 kilos per hour. In each of the embodiments of the invention, the length of the path may be increased by connecting two or more linear thrust devices in end to end relation.
