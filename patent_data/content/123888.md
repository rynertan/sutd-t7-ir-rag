# Temperature responsive switch.

## Abstract
A temperature responsive switch includes a housing 1 which can be secured to the engine block of a motor vehicle and a temperature sensitive element 4 which is in contact with the cooling medium of the motor. In order to guarantee switching dependent on the temperature T and the pres sure P of the cooling medium, in the housing 1 a hermet ically sealed bellows capillary unit 4 is disposed which responds to temperature T and pressure P of the cooling medium and around which the cooling medium circulates, being sealed against the housing portion through which the cooling medium flows, a movable switching contact 6 mounted on the bellows capillary unit 4 is disposed in a room 7 open towards the atmosphere and covered by a cover 8 and a fixed switching contact is disposed in said cover 8 , and the bellows capillary unit 4 is filled with a liquid having a vapor pressure curve of between about 1,2 bar at 96 C and 1,8 bar at 110 C.
