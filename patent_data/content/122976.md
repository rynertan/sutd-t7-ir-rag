# General purpose hydraulic test station.

## Abstract
A hydraulic test station useful for testing various types of hydraulic apparatus, both at the time of its manufacture and in the field. The test station includes a main console 10 , a roll up module 12 on which the apparatus to be tested is mounted and an electronic system for controlling the station. The main console includes a plurality of ports 5 . Each of the individual ports may be independently selected for purposes of testing a particular hydraulic apparatus and the specific port may be independently designated as a pressure port or a return port. A manifold is associated with each of the ports and is controllable to select those pressures and flow rates required for performing the desired test or tests on the con nected apparatus.
