# GRINDING BLADE DEVICE ON DRUM.

## Abstract
A grinding blade device on a drum, which is used to produce starch from potatoes and other starch plants, and processed food and juice root crops, fruits and vegetables. The grinding blade device is obtained by forming a plurality rhombic bodies, each consisting of a stack of rhombic blade elements separated by grooves 7 . Each of the rhombic blade elements has vertical edges 5 at its acute angled end portions, and horizontal edges 6 at the right angled por tions thereof at which the side surfaces, upper surface and lower surface of the rhombic body meet. This rhombic body having piled rhombic blade elements is fixed to the outer circumferential surface of a rotatable roll. Since the rhombic blade members are stacked, the number of horizontal edges 6 increases, and the efficiency of grinding plants to be processed is improved markedly owing to these edges 6 as well as the vertical edges 5 having an acute angle and capable of cutting such plants deeply.
