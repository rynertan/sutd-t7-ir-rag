# METERING AND DISPENSING UNIT

## Abstract
A metering and dispensing unit comprises a body 13, a drawer 14 and a track unit 15. The unit 13 includes upstanding walls for holding a container 12 which filled in use with granular material, such as coffee. The container 12 is sealed to the unit 13 by an upstanding wall 29 and a port 31 is provided for passage of coffee towards the drawer 14. The port is partly closed off by a sloping segment 51. When the drawer 14 closes a relatively sharp edge 52 scraps a surface 39 of the drawer 14 to clean off any material on that surface.
