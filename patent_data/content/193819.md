# System for amplifying and shaping optical pulses.

## Abstract
Especially for realizing a waveshaping function, a bistable laser 1 is employed, and a drive current during normally bi ases the bistable laser 1 to the middle point of the hysteresis region thereof. When input light exceeds a threshold level, the bistable laser is switched into the lasing state thereof, and even when the input light thereafter disappears, the laser emits light of fixed intensity. A detector 5 having detected this lasing state decreases the drive current temporarily after a predetermined period of time, to switch the bistable laser 1 into the non lasing state thereof, whereby not only the amplifi cation but also the shaping of an optical pulse signal is achieved.
