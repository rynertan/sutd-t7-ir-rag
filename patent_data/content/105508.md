# Apparatus to handle photographic disk films.

## Abstract
The apparatus to handle photographic disk films comprises a light proof casing 1 inside which there is a spindle 8 made to fit onto an openable cartridge 3 partially opening and transferring it to a position facing a film magazine 10 . During this transfer the cartridge, now set up for opening, meets a blade 34 which opens it, while the spindle 8 , provided with a motor 15 , engages the film 4 with a shaft 18 and triggers its rotation to set it up in the correct angular position for ejection and insertion in a spit 11 foreseen inside the magazine 10 .
