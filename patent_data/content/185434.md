# Controlled cracking of alpha olefin polymers.

## Abstract
An improved process for the controlled reduction of average molecular weight and alteration of molecular weight distribution of C₃ C₈ alpha monoolefin homopolymers or copolymers comprises adding a peroxide continuously at a programmed cyclic rate to the polymer or copolymer and heating the mixture in a melt extruder. The rate of peroxide addition is varied at a frequency with a period longer than the decomposition time of the peroxide but shorter than the passage time of the mixture through the extruder.

## Description
This invention relates to an improved process for reacting C₃ C₈ alpha monoolefin polymers or copolymers with peroxides to achieve controlled degradation or cracking thereof. For some commercial end uses the melt flow characteristics of C₃ polyolefins, especially polypropylene, are not suitable because of the relatively high molecular weight MW of such polymer as it is originally produced in the polymerization reactor. Important end uses where it has become accepted that the melt flow characteristics of such polymers must be substantially improved are in fibres and films. In view of this need, it has been shown in the past that higher melt flow characteristics can be achieved by controlled chain scission, which in effect reduces the molecular weight of the longer and thus high molecular weight chains. The average MW is reduced lowering the melt viscosity. Furthermore, the molecular weight distribution MWD is significantly altered, primarily because of the reduction of the high MW fraction. Improvement of melt properties associated with reduction of melt elasticity results in reduced die swell in extrusion and reduced spin resonance in fibre spinning. Chain scission cracking is normally accomplished by oxygen and or free radical sources, particularly peroxides. The basic concept of accomplishing such degradation by utilizing peroxides is disclosed in US A 3,144,436, where a free radical initiator is introduced into a polymer melt in the absence of oxygen in a screw extruder. US A 3,940,379 discloses a method for the degradation of propylene polymers by contacting a propylene polymer with oxygen and an organic or inorganic peroxide, melting and working the resulting mixture in a high shear zone, and recovering an essentially odour free propylene polymer. US A 4,061,694 discloses the manufacture of propylene moulding compositions of improved impact strength by subjecting block copolymers of ethylene and propylene to controlled oxidative degradation under conditions essentially similar to those of the preceding patent. A new term has been coined for such degraded or cracked polypropylene, that term being controlled rheology CR polypropylene. Although controlled rheology polypropylene has been commercially available for several years, its similarities and differences from normal or reactor polypropylene are just starting to be understood. CR polymers have a variety of advantages and disadvantages. The growing diversity of the polyolefin market is putting an increasing demand on polyolefin manufacturers for product grades to fit a large variety of processing behaviours as well as bulk mechanical properties. Increased control over MW and MWD in the manufacturing process is an important step in this direction. Typically, the polypropylene producers have focused on the single property, melt flow , when manufacturing CR polypropylene for specific products. However, another property molecular weight distribution MWD is also critically important. As discussed by Brown et al in Molecular Weight Distribution and its Effect on Fibre Spinning , Fibre World, Vol. 1, No. 2, pages 32 43 March 1984 , the three commonly used molecular weight averages are M In some cases, these are inadequate to express a detailed description of the MWD as they are based on averaging processes. In this case a detailed SPECTRAL analysis of the MWD is preferable, where separate segments of the MWD are specifically examined. Polypropylene homopolymers of different melt flow MF have roughly the same shape of MWD when prepared by the same reactor process. With a CR resin, this MWD changes. The three molecular weight averages are all reduced in the CR process. The fastest changing average is M Rheological melt flow behaviour is very sensitive to the MWD, particularly to the high molecular weight portion of the MWD. Reduction of the high molecular weight portion of the MWD with corresponding increase of the medium or low molecular weight portions of the MWD is referred to as narrowing of the MWD. The difference between narrow and broad MWD can have profound effects on melt processibility. For example, for two polypropylenes with the same melt flow index and different breadth of MWD, the polypropylene with the narrow MWD will generally show a reduced shear sensitivity over a wider shear range than that with the broad MWD. In the past it has not been possible to achieve independent variability of melt flow and molecular weight distribution without blending together various CR polymers or using different polymers from different polymerization conditions. The applicants have discovered a new method that permits the preparation of increased melt flow products along with control over the desired molecular weight distribution, without blending, using a single degradation or cracking process. The present invention is directed to a process for reacting a homopolymer or copolymer of an alpha monoolefin with 3 to 8 carbon atoms with from 0.001 to 1.0 parts by weight of a peroxide per 100 parts by weight of said homopolymer or copolymer and heating the resulting mixture in an extruder at a temperature of from 150 C to 300 C, characterized in that the rate of addition of said peroxide is cyclically varied at a frequency with a period longer than the decomposition time of said peroxide, but shorter than the passage time of said mixture through said extruder. The process of this invention allows for various embodiments of which the easiest operative modes are The present invention has particular application for propylene polymers useful for fibre application. Both melt flow MF and MWD of the polypropylene affect fibre properties. The effects of MF and MWD can be broadly related to processibility. In general, strength will decrease, and the draw ratio and processibility rate will increase as the MF increases. The effects of MWD on processibility are profound but are more difficult to define. Table 1 shows some general trends of properties as they relate to MF and MWD. These are generalizations, which may not always hold true for different processing conditions. Nevertheless, the table does provide some guidance for appropriate adjustment of MF and MWD In cracking a given polyolefin according to the prior art, a single steady rate of addition of peroxide in the continuous process results in a raising of the MF and narrowing of the MWD. With the exception of a general raising of processing speed, The polymers that are degraded or cracked according to this invention are homo and copolymers of C₃ to C₈ alpha monoolefins. Polypropylene is preferred. However, other polyolefins which can be processed according to the technique of this invention include propylene ethylene impact copolymers, polybutene 1, poly 3 methylbutene 1, poly 4 methylpentene 1, propylene 4 methylpentene 1 copolymers, polyallomers and the like. With regard to the propylene polymer, starting melt flows are about 0.2 to about 20, preferably about 0.5 to about 3.0. A key aspect of the present invention is that the peroxide employed for cracking must have a decomposition time which is shorter than the passage time of the polymer peroxide mixture through the melt extruder. For example, the passage time of a polymer through a 32 x1 Egan face cutting extruder is about two minutes. Therefore, the peroxide employed with such a machine must have a decomposition time shorter than two minutes. Further, the rate of peroxide addition is varied at a frequency with a period longer than the decomposition time of the peroxide. Accordingly, it is generally preferred that the peroxide have a decomposition time defined as the half life at the extrusion temperature of about 1 to about 30 seconds. If the peroxide has a half life of less than one second, the peroxide is too unstable and can be decomposed before reacting with the polymer to the desired extent. If the half life is more than about 30 seconds, then reaction may be incomplete and or selection of the frequency of addition may be too constrained to achieve the desired results. Preferred peroxides are those which have relatively high decomposition temperatures and produce volatile decomposition products, the latter being relatively non toxic and with minimal residual odour. The peroxide of choice is 2,5 dimethyl 2,5 di t butylperoxy hexane Lupersol 101 Preferably the peroxide is added to the polymer powder prior to feeding into the extruder. However, it is also possible to inject the peroxide into the polymer melt in the extruder. If it is added in this fashion, the point of injection should be downstream of the compression zone of the extruder. One possible arrangement for the injection pulsing involves the use of a 3 way valve. The 3 way valve is periodically actuated by a timed solenoid to provide the pulse of peroxide solution injection. Peroxide may be returned to the storage tank on the off period. An effective means for pulsing might also be provided by simply rotating the valve at constant speed. In this case, pulses would be sinusoidally shaped rather than rectangular. A constant pressure device would be necessary in any case for normal or direct injection. To avoid excessive repeated pumping of a given portion of peroxide solution which causes degradation an excess of peroxide solution should be in the reservoir tank. Ideally, the volume of solution should be at least N times that actually used, where N is the ratio of off on times. This would allow an average of one pumping cycle for each portion of peroxide. As used in the examples, melt flow is the amount in grams per 10 minutes of polymer which flows through a capillary with relatively small L D ratio under ASTM D1238 Condition L at 230 C. This measurement is done under constant stress. Neglecting end effects, the shear rate experienced by a polymer in a melt indexer with capillary of radius R is given by This example describes a test of the peroxide cycled addition conducted at a plant scale level. The extruder used had twelve inch diameter and produced 10,000 lbs of pelletized polypropylene per hour. Starting material was polypropylene with a melt flow of 1.5 and cracking was conducted to obtain a melt flow of 4.5 0.2. At this level of cracking, destruction of the higher MW fraction of the MWD is significant but not extensive. The increased MF was necessary to achieve the desired processing speed, yet the small changes in MWD resulted in some undesirable changes in processing behaviour fibre spinning application when the conventional non pulsed cracking technique was used. The use of the pulsed method succeeded in altering the MWD in the desired direction. The pulsing technique used is the one described by normal addition rate at zero level, periodic pulses of high addition rate. This will effect a minor amount of overcracked product ultra low MW in the polymer. STEADY INTO POWDER Conventional 22 ml min.
