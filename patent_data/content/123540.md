We have now discovered that conductive polymer compositions, especially PTC compositions, can be surprisingly improved by incorporating into them a suitable amount of a thermally conductive filler, preferably one having a high aspect ratio. The amount of the filler is preferably such that a shaped element of the composition has a thermal conductivity in at least one direction which is at least 2.0 times the thermal conductivity of an element which is identical except that the thermally conductive filler is not present therein. Such compositions are particularly useful as components of self limiting heaters.The presence of the thermally conductive filler apparently results in a more uniform generation of heat in, and or dissipation of heat from, and or absorption of heat into, the conductive polymer, this being particularly important when the conductive polymer exhibits PTC behavior, since it greatly increases the current density threshold at which a so called hot line forms when current is passed through the conductive polymer as further discussed below and furthermore results in broadening of the hot line when formed. The thermally conductive fillers which are preferably used in this invention have an aspect ratio of at least 10 and a thermal conductivity of at least 5Btu. ft hr sq.ft. F a preferred filler is highly crystalline graphite. Measurement of the aspect ratio of the filler can be carried out by known methods, employing for example a scanning electron microscope or a suitable optical microscope to fo determine the maximum and minimum dimensions of a suitable number at least 100 of randomly chosen particles, and where necessary employing suitable averaging techniques. In one aspect, the invention provides a conductive polymer composition which comprises a a polymeric component, and b dispersed in the polymeric component, i a first filler which is electrically conductive, and ii at least 2 by volume, based on the volume of the polymeric component, of a second filler which has an aspect ratio of at least 10 and a thermal conductivity of at least 5 Btu. ft hr sq ft. F. In another aspect the invention provides a selflimiting heater comprising an element composed of a composition as defined above and at least two electrodes which can be connected to a source of electrical power and which, when so connected, cause current to flow through the conductive polymer element. The conductive polymer compositions of the present invention may exhibit PTC, ZTC or NTC behavior. However, the most dramatic improvements in performance are obtained when PTC conductive polymer compositions are used. The presence of the thermally conductive filler in a PTC conductive polymer not only greatly increases the current density threshold at which a hot line forms, but also broadens the hot line if a hot line does form. In a PTC conductive polymer heater, the most important benefit provided by the thermally conductive filler is that the heater can now be operated at a higher current density and therefore higher power output in a given geometry and thermal environment without hot line formation. This benefit can be exploited in a number of different ways.For example, increased power output can be obtained by increasing the length of the current path through the PTC element, or by decreasing the crosssectional area of the PTC element at right angles to the current flow, or by increasing the voltage of the power source. When higher voltage sources are used, compositions of lower resistivity can be used this is very valuable when the resistivity would otherwise be on a steep part of the loading curve i.e. the graph of conductive filler content vs. resistivity, usually resistivity at room temperature . The presence of the thermally conductive filler also provides the benefit that if, through some mischance, a hot line does form, it is a relatively broad hot line which is less likely to damage the heater. The first filler which is used in this invention is electrically conductive and is selected primarily to provide the conductive polymer with desired resistivity at different temperatures. The second filler is selected primarily to provide the conductive polymer with desired thermal properties. The second filler can be electrically conductive. If an electrically conductive second filler is used in the conductive polymer, its presence may but does not necessarily have a significant effect on the electrical properties of the conductive polymer. The first filler generally has an aspect ratio less than 10, preferably less than 5. The preferred first filler is carbon black, but other conductive fillers can also be used.Especially for self limiting strip heaters, it is preferred to make use of a carbon black which in combination with the second filler will produce a composition having a resistivity which initially increases relatively slowly or remains substantially constant or decreases slightly with a rise in temperature above ambient and which then increases gradually to a moderately high level. The second filler preferably has an aspect ratio of at least 10, particularly at least 20, especially at least 50. The particles may be plate like, which is preferred, or rod like. The higher the aspect ratio the better, and, therefore, the processing techniques employed preferably do not break the particles so that their initial aspect ratio is reduced. The second filler is composed of a substance having a thermal conductivity of at least 5, preferably at least 20, especially at least 50, Btu. ft hr sq.ft. F. The higher the thermal conductivity the better. The average maximum dimension of the particles is usually from 10 to 600 microns, preferably 25 to 100 microns. The amount of the second filler is at least 2 , preferably at least 6 by volume, based on the volume of the polymeric component. Processing of the composition becomes increasingly more difficult as the percentage of total filler increases. The amount and type of the second filler are preferably such that the thermal conductivity of the composition in at least one direction if it is anisotropic is at least twice, preferably at least 2.5 times, eg. about 3 times, that of the same composition without the second filler. The preferred second filler is graphite in a form which has an aspect ratio of at least 5, especially premium or highly crystalline graphite. Other possible fillers include metal eg. aluminum flakes and fibers, metalcoated flakes and fibers, and metal flakes and fibers having an insulating coating, e.g. of a polymer, thereon. It is desirable that the second filler, when it is part of a PTC heater element, should have at least a substantial degree of orientation in the direction of current flow through the composition. When the heater is so constructed that the direction of current flow changes with temperature, the particles should preferably have at least a substantial degree of orientation in the direction of current flow when the device is in a high temperature high resistance state. In the conductive compositions containing the second, thermally conduct ive filler, the ratio by volume of the second filler to the first filler may be for example 2 1 to 3 1, and the total filler content may be for example 10 to 30 by volume. In the self limiting heaters of the invention, the resistivity at room temperature of the conductive polymer composition may for example be 0.1 to 200 ohm.cm for heaters to be used at low voltages, e.g. 12 to 60 volts DC 50 to 10,000 ohm.cm for heaters to be used at normal supply voltages, e.g. 100 360 volts AC and 10,000 to 100,000 ohm.cm for heaters to be used at higher voltages. The invention is particularly useful for the simplest form of self regulating strip heater, in which two or more parallel elongate electrodes are embedded in an elongate strip of PTC conductive polymer which has been melt extruded around the electrodes. The electrodes, which are usually solid or stranded wires, can be in physical contact with the PTC composition or separated therefrom by a conductive layer, eg. a priming layer or a layer of a ZTC conductive polymer. For reasons explained above and further explained below in connection with Figure 1 , this invention makes it possible to design heaters in novel configurations, for example, strip heaters which have the relatively wide and flat configurations which are desirable for example for heating flat substrates, but which have hitherto been so susceptible to hot lining that they have not been made. Thus a preferred embodiment of the invention is a strip heater comprising two or more elongate parallel electrodes embedded in a PTC conductive polymer element as defined, the distance between the closest points of the electrodes being at least 7 times, preferably at least 10 times, the thickness of the strip between the electrodes or, if the thickness varies, the average thickness .A heater of this kind is illustrated in cross section in Figure 2, and comprises wire electrodes 1 and 2 embedded inPTC conductive polymer element 3 which is surrounded by insulating jacket 4. Referring now to the accompanying drawing, Figure 1 shows the relationship between the passive power and active power of a comparative PTC strip heater, not in accordance with the invention, and various PTC strip heaters of the invention when suspended in air and when in continuous contact with a good heat sink, e.g. when pressed into intimate contact with a metal block. The passive power is the power initially generated by the heater when first connected to the power supply, while the active power is the power generated by the heater when equilibrium is reached. Curves of the kind shown in Figure 1 can be generated by systematically changing the voltage of the power source.The curves shown inFigure 1 are not intended to be completely accurate for any particular heater, but they are generally representative of the curves that would be obtained for heaters which employ a PTC conductive polymer composition based on polyethylene and which have dimensions as shown in the Examples. It will be seen that on each curve, the active power reaches a maximum and then declines. The decline is the result of the formation of a hot line. It will also be seen that the maximum active power and maximum permissible passive power is much greater when the heater is attached to a heat sink. Unfortunately, however, it is seldom, if ever, possible to make use of this fact, because in practice some part of the heater nearly always becomes separated from the heat sink and then behaves substantially as though it were in air, thus initiating a progressive deterioration of the heater if it is operated at a power level which would be satisfactory if it were bonded to the heat sink.Curves 1 and 2 in Figure 1 are curves for a strip heater in which neither the conductive polymer nor the jacket contains a thermally conductive filler, in air Curve A and attached to a heat sink Curve B these curves show that the heater cannot be used in conjunction with a power source which results in a passive power greater than about 20 watts ft and a corresponding active power of about 15 watts ft for any part of the heater which is not heat sunk and about 22 watts ft for any part of the heater which is heat sunk . Curve 3 is for a strip heater of the invention, without a jacket, suspended in air. Curve 4 is for a strip heater of the invention, with a conventional polymeric insulating jacket, attached to a heat sink.These curves show that these heaters can be safely connected to a power source which results in a passive power of up to about 75 watts ft and corresponding active power of about 25 watts ft for Curve 3 and about 90 watts ft. for Curve 4 . Curves 5 and 6 are curves for a strip heater which contains the thermally conductive filler in both the conductive polymer and the jacket the improvement is even more dramatic. EXAMPLES The invention is illustrated by the followingExamples, which are summarized in the Table below. In Examples 1, 3 and 4, the ingredients and amounts thereof in volume percentages shown in the Table under MB 1 masterbatch 1 were mixed in a preheatedBanbury mixer dumped placed on a mill heated to 149 C extruded into water through an 8.9 cm extruder fitted with a strand die and pelletized. The same procedure was followed for masterbatch 2 MB2 . The same procedure was used to convert into pellets a mixture of the indicated weights of the two masterbatches and additional amounts of polyethylene, EPDM rubber and antioxidant to give a final mix containing the indicated volume percentages of the different ingredients. InExample 2, the indicated ingredients and amounts thereof were dry blended in a Henschel mixer mixed inWerner Pfleiderer twin screw extruder at 180 215 C extruded into water through a strand die and pelletized. In each of the Examples, the pellets of the Final Mix were fed to a 3.8 cm Davis Standard Extruder and extruded through a rectangular die around two 18 AWG nickel coated copper wires separated by 2.54 cm, to give a heater strip 0.2 x 2.92 cm. The extrudate was passed through a water bath at 71 C, dried and spooled. In each of the Examples, the ingredients and amounts thereof in volume percentages shown under Jacket in the Table were mixed and converted into pellets by the same procedure as for the masterbatches. After drying, the pellets were extruded through a 3.8 cm Davis Standard extruder into a sheet 15.25 an wide and 0.05 cm thick, which was then slit into strips 3.2 cm wide and 30 cm long. Pairs of these strips were belt laminated around 30 cm lengths of the heater strips to give insulated strip heaters substantially as shown inFigure 2. The heater strips without jackets and one of the jacketed heaters were tested to determine their maximum active power outputs, with the results shown in theTable. The procedure used was to suspend the heater strip in air at 70 F. and then to determine the power output of the heater at equilibrium when connected to a succession of different voltage sources.
