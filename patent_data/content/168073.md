# Method for heat and mass exchange operations.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a method for carrying out simultaneous heat and mass exchange operations between two input streams, where a gradient of at least 30 degrees C exists between the streams, each stream contain ing at least two components. According to the invention, the two streams are introduced into a reactor containing a solid or liquid adsorbent material, which retains at least one component preferentially to the other components. The adsorbancy power of the component by the adsorbent material is higher at lower temperatures than at high temperatures. A stream results from the reactor in which the diluted component becomes more concentrated in respect to the input stream. The equilibrium concentration of the adsorbable species in the adsorbent, at the conditions of the colder stream, is higher by at least 0.01 g adsorbed species per g adsorbent than that prevailing at the conditions of the hot feed. The method is applicable to a number of processes such as gas purification, distillation, process air drying, air conditionning, air enrichement and internal combustion engines. The method imparts appreciable savings in energy requirements and improved mass transfer efficiency for processes wherein heat and mass exchange operations are involved.
