# Control of nitrogen and or oxygen in silicon via nitride oxide pressure during crystal growth.

## Abstract
The disclosure relates to a method for producing single crystal silicon 11 from a polycrystalline silicon melt 13 wherein dopants such as oxygen and nitrogen are uniformly distributed in the crystal both along the crystal axis and radially therefrom. This is accomplished by identifying the correct species in the melt 13 and above the melt and determining the thermochemical equilibrium between the two chemical species which lead to a change of the com position of the silicon single crystal 11 during the entire growth process. This approach effectively circumvents the segregation coefficient during the growth process through the control of the concentration of the depants in the melt.
