# GRAPHITE INTERCALATED ALKALI METAL VAPOUR SOURCES

## Abstract
A vapour deposition process characterised in that an alkali metal intercalate is used as a source of alkali metal vapour is disclosed. The use of an alkali metal intercalate as a source of alkali metal vapour in a vapour deposition process is also disclosed, as in a source of alkali metal vapour for use in a vapour deposi tion process comprising an alkali metal intercalate. For example, a potassium graphite intercalate, KC₈, may be heated to give a slow controlled release of potassium vapour for subsequent reaction with phosphorus vapour. Thin films of KP₁₅ and other polyphosphides may be produced by two source vapour transport and by vacuum co evaporation utilis ing KC₈ as the source of potassium vapour. RbC₈ and CsC₈ may be utilized as vapour sources to form the corresponding rubidium and cesium polyphosphides. The present invention represents an advance over the prior art.
