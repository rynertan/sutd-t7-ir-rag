## Description
The invention relates to magnet wire and a method and apparatus for manufacturing magnet wire, and more particularly, to a method and apparatus for applying a coating of flowable resin material on a continuously moving filament to a desired thickness in a single pass. Magnet wire has been conventionally manufactured by passing a bare copper or aluminium conductor or a previously insulated copper or aluminium conductor through a bath of liquid enamel a solution of resin material in a solvent and then through an oven for driving off the solvent from the enamel and or curing the resin material, leaving a resin material coat on the conductor. The application of a coat of resin material to a filament from solution accounts for all the magnet wire manufactured today. While some materials using present methods can only be applied from solution, the cost of the solvent expended in applying resin material from solution is usually significant. Also, the machinery used is complex and expensive, although the machinery cost is usually not a factor since most of such machinery has been in use for a considerable number of years.Nevertheless, the original cost of such machinery is significant in a new installation. In addition to the cost of machinery and solvent, there is the cost of providing and maintaining pollution control equipment since recently laws have required that the oven exhaust gas of such machines be virtually freed of solvent before the gases are exhausted to atmosphere. While various methods of burning the vaporized solvent and or reclaiming the solvent have been proposed, all such methods result in further expense to the manufacturer. Additionally, the application of a layer of resin material to a filament from solution usually requires several successive coats in order to result in a concentric coat of a required thickness. For example, six coats may be required for a 0.08mm coating, although in some applications as many as 24 coats have been required. Also, multiple coats of some materials cannot be applied successfully from solution, due to lack of good adhesion and wetting between coats. It is therefore desirable to provide an improved method of manufacturing magnet wire which avoids the use of solvent. Also it would be desirable to provide an improved method which would use an apparatus of simple design. Also it would be desirable to provide a method which would allow the wire to be drawn, coated and spooled in a continuous operation conventionally the wire is drawn, annealed if necessary, and spooled and then coated and spooled again for shipment. Additionally, it would be desirable to provide a method and apparatus which can successfully apply multiple layers of materials which have heretofore not been possible.Finally, it would be desirable to provide a method and apparatus which would not require the use of solvent or pollution control apparatus, or be limited to materials requiring an oven cure, or require multiple coats to obtain a coating of the required continuity and concentricity. Applying coatings of resin material by extrusion is substantially less common than applying coatings from solution, since conventional extrusion processes are limited. Coatings of O.lOmm and less are either difficult or impossible to apply by conventional extrusion processes. Also, the number of materials which can be successfully applied by conventional extrusion processes is limited. Polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene, polypropylene and various elastomeric rubbers comprise 99 of the materials which can be applied by extrusion. These materials are not used in a true magnet wire application, i.e. an electrical winding, the turns of which are insulated to provide low voltage, mechanical, and thermal protection between turns, and do not possess magnet wire properties.In contrast, these materials are conventionally used in electric mains wire applications which must protect against the full input line voltage to an electrical device. Conventionally, extrusion is used in the production only of cables, building wire, and elec tric mains wire. While the apparatus used in conventional extrusion processes is relatively simple when compared to a conventional wire coating tower, and the extrusion process can be carried out continuously whereby the filament may be drawn, coated and spooled in a continuous operation, nevertheless the conventional extrusion apparatus is not without problems. Conventional extruders include a centering die, a material reservoir and a sizing die. The centering die mechanically centers the filament in the sizing die, the sizing die determines the exterior dimensions of the coated filament and the thickness of the coat applied to the filament. The primary problem associated with extrusion apparatus is the wear on the centering die.Since the centering die is used to center the filament within the sizing die, the centering die must be finely adjusted to achieve a concentric coating, and must be replaced periodically due to the wear resulting from contact between the filament and the die. Centering dies tend to be expensive even when made of hardened steel because of the wear that occurs, diamond centering dies have been considered, but not widely used. Therefore it would be desirable to provide an improved method and apparatus for manufacturing magnet wire which would have the benefits of an extrusion process but not its disadvantages. Such a method and apparatus would reduce the cost of the machinery to manufacture magnet wire and would eliminate the need for solvent, reduce manufacturing costs, conserve raw materials and energy, eliminate the need for pollution control apparatus, require less expensive and simpler machinery than is now conventional, and allow for continuous operation from wire drawing to final ship ment without being limited to materials from solution or oven cures. It is therefore an object of this invention to provide an improved method and apparatus for manufacturing magnet wire which does not require solutions of insulation material and therefore avoids the need for solvents, pollution control equipment or for reclaiming solvents from the manufacturing process, reduces the cost of manufacturing at least proportionally to the cost of solvent, and conserves energy at least to the degree that energy is required to remove solvents from the insulation material. In the broader aspects of the invention, there is provided a method and apparatus for manufacturing magnet wire in a continuous process by which a coating of a flowable resin material may be applied concentrically to a moving elongated filament in thicknesses of about 0.40mm or less. The filament can be a bare copper or aluminium conductor of round or rectangular configuration, or an insulated conductor upon which a top coat or an intermediate coat of material is applied. Coatings of 0.013mm or 0.025mm can also be applied by the method of the invention. By the method and apparatus of the invention, magnet wire can be manufactured by continuously drawing the wire to size, annealing the wire if necessary, insulating the wire with one or more coats of the flowable resin material, curing the resin material if necessary, hardening the resin material, and spooling the wire for shipment, without interruption, at speeds limited only by the filament pay out and take up devices used. The apparatus of the invention uses the flowable resin material to centre the filament in a die, and the size of the die controls the thickness of the coat to be applied. In the apparatus of the invention, only the resin material being applied to the filament is in contact with the filament. Thus, the mechanical wear normally associated with centering dies used in extrusion processes and is avoided.Further, the apparatus and method of the invention can be used to apply coats several times thinner than is possible with conventional extrusion apparatus and of materials different than those conventionally extruded onto filaments. In specific embodiments using heat softenable materials or melts, curing is no longer required and thus, the need for curing, catalytic burners and the like, as well as all concern regarding atmospheric pollution, are eliminated. The coated filaments and magnet wire made by the apparatus and method of the invention have coatings which are surprisingly concentric and continuous when compared to magnet wire made by conventional methods and apparatus. An embodiment of the invention will now be described by way of example, with reference to the drawings in which Fig. 1 is a perspective, fragmentary and diagramatic view of one embodiment apparatus Fig. 2 is a cross section of a coating die substantially on the plane 2 2 in Fig. 1 Fig. 3 is an elevation of the coating die as seen from the line 3 3 in Fig. 1 and Fig. 4 is a cross section of the coating die on the plane 4 4 of Fig. 2. Referring to Fig. 1, the apparatus 10 includes a filament pay out device 12, a filament heater 14, a coating material dispenser 16, a coating die 18, a hardener 20, and a filament take up device 22. InFig. 1 the filament 24 is shown broken at 26, 28, and 30. At the break 26, when the apparatus is used to manufacture magnet wire, conventional wire drawing equipment may be inserted. Thus an oversized filament 24 may be reduced to the required size by the drawing equipment prior to coating the filament. The filament heater 14 may include an annealer whereby the effects of drawing or stretching the wire may be eliminated.In other embodiments in which magnet wire is being manufactured, additional coating dies 18 and hardeners 20 may be inserted at the break 28 such that successive coats of different coating materials may be applied in a continuous manner. The term filament is used herein for all strand materials. Filament thus includes both copper and aluminium conductors, and also insulated copper and aluminium conductors which, prior to the application of a coat of material by the present apparatus, have been insulated with a base coat of insulating material, a tape of insulating material either spirally or longitudinally wrapped on the conductor, or other conventional insulating materials, and other strand materials desirably coated. While the specific embodiments herein described primarily relate to the manufacture of magnet wire, the apparatus of the invention is thought to have utility in coating other kinds of filaments than conductors or insulated conductors for the production of magnet wire. The term flowable material is used herein for the general class of coating materials applied by the method and apparatus of the invention. Again, while the embodiments herein described refer to meltable coating materials which can be hardened by cooling the material to ambient temperatures, other coating materials which are flowable at elevated temperatures and pressures are contemplated as being within the said general class of coating materials which can be applied.These materials include materials which are initially flowable but are later hardened by curing or thermosetting the material and also coating materials which may include up to about 5 by weight of solvent to render them flowable and later hardenable by driving the solvent from the material. In the manufacture of magnet wire, several different materials can be applied. These include polyamides such as Nylon, polyethylene terephthalates, polybutylene terephthalates, polyethylenes, polyphenylene sulfide , polycarbonates, polypropyl enes, polyethersulfone, polyether imides, polyether etherketone, polysulphones, epoxys, fluorocarbons including ethylene chlorotrifluoroethylene and hylene tetrafluoroethylene polyvinyl formal, phenoxys, polyvinyl butyrol, polyamide imide, polyesters and combinations thereof. The filament pay out device 12 includes a first spool 32 on which the filament 24, desirably coated, is stored. The spool 32 is mounted on spindle 34 of the pay out device 12 so as to rotate freely in the direction of arrow 36. The spool 32 has a brake 38 which restrains its rotation as the filament 24 is being pulled therefrom by the take up device 22, so as to prevent entanglements. It is possible that, in a magnet wire manufacturing plant where conductors are being rolled, drawn or otherwise reduced in size to the required filament from ingots, the pay out device 12 can be omitted, since the remaining apparatus can be used to coat filament continuously in a single pass as the filament is supplied from the rolling and drawing apparatus.The spools 32 in this instance can be the reels upon which bare copper and aluminium conductors are now transported from the rolling and drawing apparatus to the magnet wire manufacturing plant. When the take up device 12 is omitted and rolling and drawing apparatus substituted, an annealer is used to eliminate the effects of working the conductor during rolling and drawing. A filament heater 14 may be used solely to raise the temperature of the filament prior to application of the coating material, or may be used to anneal the filament if hard, bare wire is used, or further to reduce the effects of the rolling and drawing, if required. The filament heater 14 may be an annealer, or may be simply a filament heater. The filament heater 14 comprises a resistance coil 40, generally tubular in shape, and having opposite open ends 42 and 44. The filament 24 is trained between the payout device 12 and the take up device 22 through the coil 40. The filament heater 14 also has a control 46 by which the temperature of the filament 24 can be controlled. The filament heater 14 may also include a filament temperature measuring device such as a radiation pyrometer.Hereinafter in specific examples, the approximate wire temperatures given have been measured by such a device. The coating die 18 is illustrated in Figs. 1 to 4.The coating die 18 includes an entrance die 61, an exit die 62 and a die block 64. Entrance die 61 is mounted in the forward portion of die block 64 by screws 66.Exit die 62 is mounted in the rearward portion of die block 64 by screws 66 . Separating entrance die 61 and exit die 62 is an interior passage 65. Die block 64 is provided with heater bores 68 in which heaters 70 are positioned. Each heater 70 may for example be a tubular calrod heater. Additionally, the die block 64 has a thermocouple bore 72 in which a thermocouple 74 Fig 4 may be placed. Further, die block 64 has a nozzle bore 75 to which the nozzle 54 of material applicator 16 is connected. Hereinafter, die temperatures are given with regard to specific examples these die temperatures are measured by the thermocouple 74. Heaters 70 are connected by conductors to a heater 76.Heater 76 is provided with paired controls 78 whereby the temperature of the entrance die 61 and the exit die 62 can each be raised above ambient temperature for each die and controlled, respectively, as required. Referring to Fig. 2, the entrance die 61 includes an entrance opening 80, a throat 82 and a converging interior wall 84 which connects the throat 82 and the entrance opening 80. Entrance die 61 also has an exit opening 86 and a diverging interior wall 88 interconnecting the throat 82 and the exit opening 86. The entrance die 61 may be constructed as illustrated in two piece fashion, having a central piece 90 including a throat portion of harder and more wear resistant material, and exterior piece 90 which includes both the entrance opening 80 and the exit opening 86. The exit die 62 includes an entrance opening 92, a throat 93 and a converging interior wall 94 which interconnects the throat 93 and the entrance opening 92.Converging interior wall 94 part defines a die chamber 95 as will be mentioned hereinafter. Exit die 62 also has an exit opening 96 and a diverging interior wall 97 that interconnects the throat 93 and the exit opening 96. The exit die 62 may be constructed as illustrated in two piece fashion having a central piece 98 including a throat portion of harder and more wear resistant material than the exterior piece 98 which includes both the entrance opening 92 and exit opening 96. The converging walls 84 and 94 define an angle A with filament 24 of from 5 to 40 degrees and throats 82 and 93 are tapered from converging walls 84 and 94 to diverging walls 88 and 97 so as to define an angle with the filament 24 of 1 to 2 degrees. The flowable material applicator 16 Fig. 1 has a hopper 48 by which the material is supplied to the applicator, a material reservoir 50 in which the material may be stored, and a positive displacement pump which pressurizes reservoir 50 and dispenses the flowable material through a nozzle 54. When using melts or other temperature responsive flowable materials, reservoir 50 is provided with a heater and control device 56 by which the temperature of the material in the reservoir can be controlled. An additional control device 58 is associated with the positive displacement pump to control the amount of flowable material passing through nozzle 54. The fluid material applicator 16 may be an extrusion apparatus having the features above described.In those applications in which the flowable material is rendered more flowable by the use of a small amount of solvent, both the coating material and the solvent may be fed into the applicator via the hopper 48 and the reservoir 50 may have a mixing apparatus with a sepa rate control 60. The central die chamber 95 Fig. 2 is defined by the diverging wall 88 of entrance die 61, the converging interior wall 94 of exit die 62, and the walls of interior passage 65 of die block 64. Die chamber 95 is positioned between throat 82 and throat 93. The nozzle 54 is connected to nozzle bore 75 so that coating material in reservoir 50 may be injected into the central die chamber 95 under pressure by material applicator 16. The filament 24 is trained between the pay out device 12 and the take up device 22 through the entrance die 61, the central die chamber 95, and the exit die 62. The hardener 20 Fig. 1 hardens the coat of material on the filament 24 prior to spooling the coated filament or magnet wire by the take up device 22. The hardener 20 includes a trough 100 having opposite open ends 102 and 104. The trough is positioned such that the filament 24 can be trained to enter the open end 102, pass through the trough 100, and leave at the open end 104. As shown, the trough 100 is sloped downwardly towards the open end 102 and provided with a source of cooling fluid, such as water 108, adjacent open end 104 and a drain 110 adjacent open end 102. In some cases a water quench using the hardener 20 is needed. In other cases a quench is not required and the cooling fluid is not used. In these other cases, either a flow of ambient air or of refrigerated air is trained on the coated filament 24. In cases in which multiple coats of different materials are to be applied to the filament 24, successive, spaced coating dies 18 are used. The particular coating die used depends on the material to be applied. Each coating die will have a material applicator 16 associated with it and may also have a hardener 20 associated with it. The term coating station is used herein to refer to the assemblage of a material applicator 16, a coating die, and a hardener 20. In these cases, there will be a plurality of spaced apart coating stations between the pay out device 12 and the take up device 22. The latter comprises a second reel 32 on which the coated filament 24 is spooled for shipment. The two reels 32 may be conventional spools on which coated filaments are usually shipped. Each spool 32 is mounted for rotation on a spindle 34 and driven in the direction of the arrow 112.Connected to the second spool 32 is a spool driver 114 which drives the second spool 32 to pull the filament 24 from the first spool or reel 32. The method of the invention will now be described with reference to the manufacture of magnet wire in a single pass whereby the filament is drawn or otherwise formed, coated and spooled in a continuous operation. A continuous supply of the filament 24 is provided either by the pay out device 12 as illustrated in Fig. 1, or from a rolling and drawing operation. If supplied from a rolling and drawing operation, the filament 24 is annealed to remove the effects of rolling and drawing. The filament 24 is then heated if required, depending on the coating material used and the wire properties needed. Thus the filament 24 may be heated by the heating device 14 to a temperature from ambient temperature to the decomposition temperature of the coating material. In most applications using a melt or heatresponsive flowable material in which the coat of material is adhered to the filament 24, the filament is heated to a temperature from just below to about the melting point of the coating material. In most applications using a melt or a heat responsive flowable material in which adhesion of the coat of material to the filament 24 is not required, the filament is maintained from the ambient temperature to slightly above ambient temperature. The central die chamber 95 is then filled with a flowable material. The. flowable material is stored in the reservoir 50 at a flowable temperature and pressure and is injected into the chamber 95 by applicator 16. Once the chamber 95 has been filled, the material therein will assume the pressure of the flowable coating material in the reservoir 50. The pump must have an adequate capacity to maintain pressures up to about 2000 psi in reservoir 50 and chamber 95. By use of the control 58, the responsiveness to pressure changes desired can be controlled. By controls 56 and 78, the temperature of the material in the reservoir 50 and chamber 95 can be controlled. The pressurized temperature of the flowable material in the central die chamber 95 must be carefully controlled for several reasons.First, if the pressure and or temperature of the flowable material in the chamber 95 is too great, the material may have the tendency to leak in a significant quantity from the chamber 95 through throat 82, although the filament passing through throat 82 will allow operating pressures higher than that at which the flowable material will leak from opening 80 when the filament is stationary in opening 80. Any significant leakage of material from the die block 64 is to be avoided. Secondly, both the pressure and temperature of the flowable material relate to the viscosity and or flow characteristics of the flowable material, and must be such that the viscosity and or flow characteristics of the flowable material performs its centering function relative to the exit die 62 and produces a concentric coating as will be discussed , wets the filament to be coated, and adheres to the filament.Thirdly, if the pressure and the temperature of the flowable material is too low, excessive filament stretching may occur by virtue of die 18 resisting unduly the movement of the. filament. It is for these reasons that the applicator 16 has the controls 56, 58, and 60. The coating material is then applied to the filament 24 by passing it through die 18. The coating material within the die chamber functions to center the filament 24 within the throat portions 82 and 93 of dies 61 and 62. In all instances known to the applicants wherein the central die chamber 95 is properly filled with coating material 115 and the temperature and pressure therein are properly controlled, filaments 24 that are coated by the method and apparatus of the invention have a surprisingly concentric and continuous coat of coating material thereon. Conversely, in all cases in which the central die chamber 95 is not properly filled, and or the temperature and pressure therein is not properly controlled, a non concentric and discontinuous coating of material is applied to the filament 24.Thus proper filling of the central die chamber 95 with coating material, and control of the temperature and pressure of the coating material therein are important. Coating materials of various types have been successfully applied in accordance with the method of the invention by the above described apparatus at viscosities from 5,000 cps to 200,000 cps. The action of the flowable material in the central die chamber 95 is not fully understood, but it does result in filaments having coatings of virtually perfect concentricity and continuity thereon. The coating material in the central die chamber 95 is believed to have movement adjacent the throat 93 of the exit die 62. The throat portion 82 of the entrance die 61 prevents the flowable material in the chamber 95 from leaking from die 18 through die 61. Depending upon the flow properties of the coating material, throat portion.82 will have a diameter of from 0.08 mm to 0.38 mm larger than the diameter of filament 24. The throat portion 93 regulates the thickness of the coating material left on the filament 24 leaving the die 18. The size of the throat portion 93 varies in accordance with the size of the filament 24, and the required thickness of the coating material to be applied. The method of the invention has been successfully used with filaments ranging from 30 AW gauge to 9.5 mm rod.Conductors of rectangular and other cross section can also be coated, with the throats 82 and 93 of the entrance die 61 and exit die 62, respectively, provided of geometrically appropriate shape. Coatings from 0.013 mm to 0.41 mm thick can be applied by the method of the invention. Depending upon the flow properties of the coating material, the throat portion 93 will have a diameter in most cases from the required diameter to 0.05 mm larger than the required diameter of the coated filament 24 of magnet wire. The coated filament 24 is then passed through the hardener 20 to harden the coating material. While the structure and operation of the hardener has been described above, it should be emphasized that its operation depends upon the coating material used. Either a water quench or an air quench may be utilized. Additionally, for those flowable materials in which small amounts of solvent are used, the hardener 20 may be a filament heater 14, or a conventional curing oven not shown . In all cases, the type of hardener 20 used and the temperature of the cooling liquid, air or other fluid will depend on the coating material and the speed at which the coated filament passes through the hardener 20. The speed at which the driver 114 drives the second spool 32 of the take up device 22 in the embodiment of Fig. 1, is limited by the pay out 12 and take up 22 devices themselves when applying any of the coating materials mentioned herein. When the pay out device 12 is omitted and conventional rolling and drawing operations are substituted, the speed at which the takeup device 22 is driven by the driver 114 is solely by the take up device 22 itself. Examples in which conductors of various sizes have been coated with coating material in accordance with the invention are tabulated in the following Table. TheTable relates to the production of magnet wire. TheTable tabulates the properties of the coating material and the conductor, the process conditions, and the physical and electrical properties of the magnet wire produced. The magnet wire produced by the apparatus and method of the invention meets the requirements of magnet wire made by existing commercial processes. The Table tabulates the physical and electrical properties of various magnet wires manufactured in accordance with the invention. A surprising characteristic of all magnet wires made in accordance with the invention is the concentricity of the coating applied to the filament and the continuity thereof. Both the concentricity and continuity are a surprising result when compared to magnet wires made by existing commercial processes, without regard to the means by which the filament 24 is centered within the coating die 18. Magnet wire produced by known commercial processes, such as the application of coatings from solution, periodically result in non concentric coatings and non continuous coatings. In fact, the continuity of coatings applied from solution is such that reliance upon a single coating of magnet wire insulation is unknown and for this reason multiple coatings are used. Magnet wire having a single coat is a commercial reality due to the concentricity and thickness of the coatings that can be applied by the apparatus and method of the invention.
