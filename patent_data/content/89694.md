# CHROMATIC ABERRATION CORRECTED GRADIENT INDEX LENS SYSTEM

## Abstract
An optical system and method is disclosed for substan tially correcting an image transmitted through at least one gradient index lens for chromatic aberration by means of a homogeneous lens affixed thereto. In preferred embodi ments, at least one of the gradient index lenses is a relay lens. The length of the relay lens is varied about an integral number of half periods and the homogeneous lens has a positive or negative curvature, depending upon the nature of the correction required. A method of determining the curvature or the homogeneous lens and the length of the relay lens for the desired degree of correction is also claimed.
