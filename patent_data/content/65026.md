The present invention pertains to a process for preparing a carbamate from an organic carbonate and an aromatic amine in the presence of a catalytic quantity of a Lewis acid characterized by employing as the Lewis acid catalyst, a catalyst which is soluble in the reaction mixture at the reaction conditions employed and which is at least one member selected from the group consisting of a zinc or divalent tin halide, a zinc or divalent tin salt of a monovalent organic compound having a pKa value of at least 2.8, preferably from 4 to 10, and a zinc or divalent tin salt of trifluoroacetic acid.

When the organic carbonate is a cyclic organic carbonate such as, for example, ethylene carbonate, or an acyclic carbonate such as, for example, dimethyl carbonate, a zinc or divalent tin salt ot trifluoroacetic acid can be employed, even though trifluoroacetic acid has a pKa value below 2.8. The reaction is generally conducted at a temperature of from 800C to 3000C, preferably from 1200C to 2500C and most preferably from 1300C to 2000C for a time sufficient to complete the reaction depending upon the particular catalyst, reactants and temperature employed. Usually around 1500C, the time is from one hour to six hours, preferably from two hours to four hours.

Mounted on the lid using stainless steel pipe fittings and parts were a pressure gauge, a pressure relief valve, and a needle valve. After charging the mixture to the reactor, the lid was sealed by tightening down on the polytetrafluoroethylene O ring and the reactor was immersed in a hot fluidized sand baEh chermostatically controiled at 1400C in the center of the bath. The reactor was heated from between 10 to 15 minutes, then shaken to mix the contents. Then heating was continued for the desired time. After cooling the contents were analyzed for yields of carbamate and by products. The quantity of catalysts, reaction conditions and results are given in the following Table I. InTable I, the pressure listed under Reaction Conditions is gauge pressure. Under the headings of ReactionProducts, MPC stands for methyl phenyl carbamate, NMA stands for N methyl aniline, and DPV stands for diphenyl urea.
