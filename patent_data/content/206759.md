## Abstract
A scroll type compressor includes a housing 10 having a fluid inlet and outlet ports 31, 32 . A fixed scroll 21 is fixed within the housing and has a circular end 211 plate from which a first spiral element 212 extends. The end plate of the fixed scroll partitions the inner chamber of the housing into a front chamber 27 connected to the fluid inlet port 31 and a rear chamber 28 . The rear chamber is divided into a discharge chamber 281 connected to the fluid outlet port 32 and an intermediate pressure chamber 282 . The end plate 211 of the fixed scroll has at least two holes 214, 215 which connect the fluid pockets between the spiral elements to the intermediate pressure chamber 282 . The end plate 211 also has a communicating hole 29 which connects the front chamber 27 and the intermediate chamber 283 . A control device 36 , which controls the communication between the front chamber 27 and the intermediate pressure chamber 283 is disposed on the intermediate pressure chamber, and a valve element 362 of the control device is operated by pressure from the discharge chamber 281 .
