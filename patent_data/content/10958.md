# Homing system and technique for guiding a missile towards a metal target.

## Abstract
A homing system guides a missile 10 towards a metal target. The missile is provided with a radar unit 12 to transmit a radar signal of predetermined frequency, and a tracking antenna 14 which scans a predetermined search pattern to receive a reflected radar signal from the target. Missile guidance and control means 51 respond to error signals to correct the flight path of the missile. The system includes a local oscillator 68 connected to a multiplier 70 for generating fundamental and harmonic reference frequencies. The received radar signal is split into two channels each including a filter 18, 20 , a demodulator 22, 24 and a detector 34, 40 . The output of the detector in the harmonic frequency channel is integrated 56 and supplied to a threshold detector 58 . A switch 44 selectively connects the out put of the fundamental and harmonic frequency detectors to an error signal generating circuit for producing the error signals. The switch is actuated when the integrated signal of the received harmonic frequency exceeds a predetermined threshold.
