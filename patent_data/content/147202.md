# System for controlling the clutch torque of an electromagnetic clutch for a vehicle.

## Abstract
A vehicle with an electromagnetic clutch 1 has an accelerator pedal switch 15 which produces a given output signal when an accelerator pedal of the vehicle is released. A clutch current circuit 18 20 includes a transistor 20 and controls the clutch current passing through the coil b of the electromagnetic clutch 1 . When the vehicle speed is above a predetermined value, as determined by a switch 16 , a logic gate circuit 26 responds to the given output signal of the accelerator pedal switch 15 to control the transistor 20 so as to decrease the clutch current to a low value approximately to zero for a moment following release of the accelerator pedal and thereafter to gradually increase the current to a predetermined value.
