## Description
FEEDING BOWL This invention relates to feeding bowls suitable for babies of the type arranged to keep food contained within the bowl warm. In a known construction, such a bowl has a compartment into which hot water can be poured, so that the food within the bowl is kept warm by the heat ofthe water. This type of bowl functions adequately, but has always presented several hazards largely because the opening to the hot water compartment has invariably been located on the upper surface of the bowl. This positioning of the opening facilitates easy access for filling and reduces the risk of leakage of the hot water from the opening when the bowl is in normal use, however, this positioning of the opening often leads to the opening not being adequately sealed if the bowl is mis used either because the plug closing the opening has only been designed to seal against minor splashes of hot water or because it has not been inserted properly. Since one is not forced to check that the plug will seal the opening even during mis use of the bowl, a danger arises that a baby can be presented with a bowl containing hot water which may spill out if the bowl is tipped. Furthermore the plug is within easy reach, and if it is not properly secured it may be loosened or even removed by the baby. A further disadvantage of a bowl having an opening on its uppermost surface is that the plug interrupts the otherwise smooth upper surface of the bowl, providing a place in which food can lodge, thus presenting a possible health hazard. It is an object of the present invention to provide a baby feeding bowl which is capable of keeping the baby s food warm, but which does not suffer from the disadvantages of the known design. According to the invention there is provided a bowl comprising an upper section into which food may be placed and a lower section on which the bowl may stand, the two sections having between them a compartment, the lower section having a hole through which a hot liquid may be introduced into the compartment and a removable plug sealing the hole. Preferably, the plug is located in the hole by means of a screw thread connection. Preferably the plug and the hole are below the level of the liquid in the compartment when the bowl is in normal use.The hole may be in the bottom surface of the lower section. Thus, the filling hole is preferably not in a position where food may easily be trapped in it and the danger of accidental removal of the plug is minimised.Furthermore, if the plug is not properly replaced after filling the compartment with hot water, this will be noticed almost at once. Preferably, the hole is surrounded by a skirt on which the bowl stands in normal use. In a preferred method of manufacturing bowls according to the invention, the two sections are formed as separate components which are joined together around one rim ofthe lower section. The invention may be carried into practice in various ways and one embodiment will now be described, by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a perspective view of the uppermost side of a baby bowl in accordance with the present invention Figure 2 is a perspective view of the underside of the baby bowl shown in Figure 1 Figure 3 is a sectional side elevation taken on a diameter of the bowl shown in Figure 1 and Figure 4 is a sectional side elevation taken on a diameter of the plug which is shown inserted into the baby bowl in Figure 2. The baby feeding bowl 2 shown in Figure 1 is of a generally short stepped cylindrical form and consists of three parts a dish section 4, a warming section 6 and a plinth 8. The dish section 4 is of shallow cylindrical form and has a flat bottom. A tab 1 2 projects from the rim of the dish, enabling the bowl to be steadied, in use, and also allowing easier separation of the bowls when stacked. The warming section 6 is effectively another dish having the same form as the dish section 4 but having a smaller diameter. In addition, the warming section 6 has a plug hole 1 4 see Figure 3 in its bottom surface. The rim of the warming section is sealed to the underside of the bottom of the dish section 4 as shown at 24 in Figure 3, thereby creating a sealed compartment 1 6 which is accessible only by way of the plug hole 14. The plinth section 8 comprises a short cylindrical skirt having a smaller diameter than the warming section 6. The skirt extends down from the underside of the warming section 6 and surrounds the plug hole 14, and may be adapted to receive a sucker ring 15 partially shown in Figure 3 and with which the bowl may be affixed to a surface by suction. A plug 10, as shown in Figure 4 is sealably insertable into the plug hole 14 as shown in Figure 2 thereby enabling the compartment 16 to be completely sealed. The plug 10 comprises a short screwed shank 18 and a relatively large diameter head 20 with a sealing washer 22 mounted on the shank 18 adjacent the head 20. The bowl 2 may be manufactured from a plastics material by moulding. The dish section 4 would be moulded as one component while the warming section 6 and plinth 8 would be moulded as a single separate component. The two components would then be fixed together with adhesive. The plug 10 may also be of a moulded plastics material. The positioning of the plug hole 14 in the bottom of the warming section 6 ensures that the following sequence of operations must be performed when the bowl 2 is to b used. Firstly, the bowl 2 must be inverted and preferably laid on a flat surface so that the plinth section 8 is uppermost. With the plug 10 removed, hot water is poured into the compartment 16. During this operation the plinth 8 acts as a bund wall, catching any hot water which fails to enter through the hole 14. The plug 10 is then screwed into the hole 14 forming a tight seal before the bowl 2 can be returned to the upright position with the dish section 4 uppermost. in returning the bowl 2 to the upright position any hot water caught in the plinth section 8 is tipped out, and the sealing of the plug 10 is inherently checked. Finally, food is served into the bowl section 4. It will be appreciated that various other configurations may be used to produce the same end result, in addition to the one specifically described. For example, the dish section 4 may be of a shallow concave form secured around its rim to the warming section 6 so that the entire surface of the dish is adjacent the warming section 6. Alternatively a flatter, plate section could replace the dish section.
