# Key telephone system with distributed control.

## Abstract
A system for accessing a plurality of main exchange lines CO1, CO2, CO3 by a plurality of stations and for exchanging signals between the stations. Each station is provided with a self sufficient microprocessor 10 which controls all the functions of the station. The microprocessors exchange control signals to indicate the status of each station and each line. A common intercom line is provided for both audio signals and control signals. Each station is assigned a unique address so that each station is able to dial up another station for intercom communication by generating the proper control signals. Each station is also provided with a switch matrix 120 for selectively accessing any of the lines, line status indicating means 32, 34, 36 and line holding means 52, 54, 56 which is automatically released when any station accesses the held line.
