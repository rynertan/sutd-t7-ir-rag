# A method of and apparatus for monitoring the operation of a vehicle.

## Abstract
A method of and apparatus for monitoring the operation of a vehicle comprises sensing means in the form of one or more mercury containing capsules 12.1, 12.2 to sense whether accelerative forces acting on the vehicle in the plane of movement of the vehicle exceed or are less than a pre determined value, a pulse generator 20 operative in response to the sensing means 12.1, 12.2 to generate a number of pulses at predetermined intervals when the accelerative forces exceed the predetermined value, a counter 24 operative in response to the pulse generator 20 to gen erate a pulse count representative of the length of time for which the accelerative forces have exceeded the predeter mined value, a timer 28 operative to be triggered in response to the sensing means 12.1, 12.2 when the accelerative forces exceed the predetermined value, a comparator 26 operative in response to the counter 24 and the timer 28 to compare the first signal with a predetermined signal a predetermined period of time after triggering of the timer, and a recorder 30 operative in response to the comparator 26 to make a record ing when the first signal is less than said predetermined signal, and not to make a recording when the signal is equal to the predetermined value.
