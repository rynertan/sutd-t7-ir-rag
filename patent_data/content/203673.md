# METHOD FOR HEAT LOSS SURVEY

## Abstract
A method for heat loss surveys comprising the steps of obtaining one or more thermal profiles of a surface radiating heat, the thermal profiles being marked in depicting areas of specified temperatures at a selected location on each surface a heat flux measurement is made to thereby identify the heat loss from the surface at the selected location. The selected heat loss measurement is then correlated with the thermal profiles by employing a scaling equation to thus obtain indication of heat loss from all increments of the thermal profile, and thence from the entire surface under investigation. Heat loss evaluations for each of the various surfaces of the object being measured are then totalized. The total heat loss and the consequent cost thereof is considered to determine if heat insulation of the object will enhance or impede return on investment.

## Description
In many different kinds of structures, heat loss or gain can be a serious problem from the standpoint of utility cost. For example, in commercial buildings and dwellings, air conditioning and heating are major cost factors. Also in manufacturing processes in the petroleum, chemical and petrochemical industries, heat transfer can have considerable importance. For purposes of simplicity, however, heat transfer and the need for surveying it is discussed herein particularly in application to industrial processes. Such is not intended to limit the spirit and scope of this invention. The utility cost of a petrochemical plant can be substantial. A part of the utility cost is occasioned by the necessity of maintaining the process at specified temperatures. As the cost of utilities increase, it becomes expedient to consider applying insulation to reduce heat loss. Insulation of manufacturing process equipment and other structures for heat loss reduction must provide a reasonable return on investment ROI to render the provision of insulation commercially feasible. It is generally too costly to simply insulate every exposed surface. Conversely, it is wasteful simply to let a substantial heat flux from the operating petrochemical plant markedly increase the cost of utilities and thus increase the ultimate cost of goods to the consumer. In the past, heat loss surveys have been conducted mathematically, based on multiple temperature point samples from the object in question and taking into account the ambient temperature at the time of sampling, weather bureau reports of wind direction and velocity, and perhaps other factors as well. These heat loss surveys have been time consuming, expensive, and are subject to many possibilities for error. Two modes primarily determine the rate of heat loss. That is, heat loss is occasioned by radiation of heat and or by convection of heat. The radiation loss is particularly important when temperatures approach approximately 400 F or higher. The loss is substantial at that level, and at higher temperatures. An additional factor is the loss of heat by convection. This refers to the loss of heat as a result of heating the surrounding air. So to speak, an outdoor situated petrochemical plant is an air cooled structure. Of the several similar theory based methods of heat loss measurement which are common in industry at the present time, a heat loss measurement equation relating to turbulent flow on vertical surfaces appears to be the most satisfactory. This technique, however, is nevertheless ripe with opportunities for error. For example, a point much hotter or much colder than the surface average can very easily be chosen for the surface point temperature. Also, reported wind velocities seldom accurately represent the local micro environment of surface convection. Also, adopting a particular radiative sink temperature is a gross generalization, even if high temperature equipment in the vicinity is neglected common in industrial plants . On a clear night, due to the high absorbtivity and cold temperatures of space, the radiative sink would probably be much lower than the local air temperature. On a sunny day, obviously, the sink temperature would be somewhat higher. A more accurate technique would either avoid the need for assuming a radiative sink temperature of would more accurately calculate the sink temperature existing at the time of data collection. The present invention concerns the principle of obtaining heat loss values for a relatively larger area based on an incremental heat loss sample metered by any suitable means or calculated using traditional convective and or radiative equations and an overall temperature profile of the surface under consideration. From the sampled increment, heat losses at other portions of the surface are scaled according to the temperature profile. Increments are summed to provide total heat loss, from which a determination can be made whether other cost of insulating the surface compared with heat loss savings will provide an acceptable net return of investment. Through suitable infrared photographic techniques, a thermal image of a structure can be obtained. This approach, however, will provide temperature profile lines. Even so, the heat loss is not a simple function of the surface temperature profile alone. Thus, if temperature profile lines are set at a spacing of 20 F across a surface, merely obtaining such a profile by infrared photographic techniques will not in and of itself provide data to accurately determine the overall heat loss. With the profile and scant , additional easily collected data, typical heat loss equations could be solved for all elements, and the results summed. In fact, this is done in situations where a fluxmeter cannot be used. Though this is a great improvement over former methods considering the fact that minute thermal details across the whole surface are rapidly considered without the use of a fluxmeter, the procedure still has the possibility of significant errors due to the difficulty of obtaining an accurate ambient temperature for any point on the surface. For this reason, a measured heat loss sample is obtained from one element of a surface study area whenever possible, and the boundaries of the area are chosen so that every element within the area can reasonably be assumed to have the same emissivity, and be exposed to the same wind velocity and radiant ambient temperature. Because there are so many variables involved, the present method simplifies and enables the taking of simple temperature measurements whereby an entire surface area such as the surface of a petrochemical refining or processing unit can be evaluated. This method enables heat loss of a structure to be determined typically on a per unit area basis which can be extended to the whole area or to selected portions thereof. The measurement typically provided is total BTU loss per surface area and can be obtained for any desired temperature on the surface area. Thus, data and measurements can be obtained for any area, and areas which are too cool to merit further investigation can be discarded. While the foregoing speaks very generally of the procedure set forth in detail hereinbelow, a better understanding will be obtained upon a review of the following specification with reference to the drawings which are described below. So that the manner in which the above recited features, advantages and objects of the present invention are attained and can be understood in detail, more particular description of the invention, briefly summarized above, may be had by reference to the embodiments thereof which are illustrated in the appended drawings. It is to be noted, however, that the appended drawings illustrate only typical embodiments of this invention and are therefore not to be considered limiting of its scope, for the invention may admit to other equally effective embodiments. Three different application categories for this technology are being researched. These are outlined Roman numerals below. Retrofit surveys can be conducted on a routine basis by a mobile crew without interrupting production. The mobile heat loss survey crew may employ a suitable thermal imager for obtaining an overall thermal image of the heat envelope of an apparatus to aid in measuring heat loss from selected views of the envelope. Such thermal imaging is not intended to limit this invention. Other accurate methods of producing temperature profiles exist, and some may prove useful in particular circumstances. Generally, however, the convenience of thermal imaging is preferred. The accurate heat loss data obtained by this economical method can best be employed for return on investment decisions with respect to adding insulation or heat recovery equipment to existing systems. A. Attention is directed to Fig. 1 of the drawings where a representative setting is shown such as for a petrochemical operating unit and associated buildings and other structures in which heat loss measurements are to be obtained. Any of the structures in the figure may be measured according to the principles of this invention to determine the influence of heat insulation on return of investment. The present heat loss measurement procedure implements solutions to the various problems set forth above. For an understanding of the basic heat loss data collection procedure advanced herewith, the following heat loss measurement procedure emphasizes heat loss data collection. The procedure includes five basic steps which are 1 preliminary investigation 2 initial site survey 3 task layout 4 data collection 5 data reduction and final analysis. According to the present invention, a number of innovative principles are provided for effective heat loss data collection and measurement. These principles will be identified as the procedure is explained in a representative sequential manner. Quick heat loss field surveys are recommended for rapid and convenient analysis of most exposed to convection radiation heat loss systems such as industrial or commercial systems. The technique is useful for accurately quantifying losses from physical models of thermal systems or parts of systems . While this procedure is described for a model illustrated as a block, practically all types of structures having a variety of shapes can be analyzed. 1 A primary principle according to the present invention is the principle of obtaining heat loss values for a relatively large area based on an incremental heat loss sample metered by any means or calculated utilizing traditional convection and or radiation equations and an overall temperature profile collected by any means . From the sample increment, heat loss from other increments is scaled. Data reduction and reporting may be conducted by means of a computer. Alternatively, data may be recorded for processing through a computer at another location. Data reduction and reporting is as follows The incremental heat losses may be studied individually by or in subgroups. It is most convenient to deal with these increments as elements of definite and specified physical size. From this data, accurate energy cost loss and ROI can easily be calculated using well known formulae. Another important aspect of the present invention concerns utilization of a contact, thermophile type thermal fluxmeter or other direct heat loss measuring device to obtain an accurate reference heat loss sample for each area for use in the heat loss equations developed under the principle of quick heat loss surveys according to the process of paragraph I above. a A set of heat loss surveys is collected by the technique described above . Where a reference site cannot be accessed with a contact pyrometer and a heat flux measurement device, the thermal profile is generated from optical data and heat flow from each matrix element is solved, but metered reference samples provide much more reliable results. Heat fluxmeter devices are available, and one such device is set forth in application Serial No. 06 705,754 by the common inventor herewith entitled PORTABLE HEAT FLUXMETER FIXTURES, filed February 25, 1985. This device is applied to the surface to measure heat flux. Heat flux is typically given in units of BTU per surface area per hour. This measure is thus obtained at selected locations. Only one of these reference measurements is required for each unique surface emissivity within each image collected. For instance, if the entire object is painted with a medium gray alkyd paint emissivity, about 0.92 , and if representative images are collected on the north, south, east and west sides, then only 4 heat flux samples are required one sample from each side. If a single image contains an area with somewhat oxidized aluminum insulation sheeting emissivity, perhaps 0.40 as well as the gray paint, however then a second flux sample is recommended. This is because it is so inconvenient to exactly quantify emissivities in the field. After field images are reduced to areas of homogeneous emissivities and exposure to external convection and or radiant sources and sinks, heat loss at every unsampled site within individual areas can be scaled from the sampled flux site within the same area using an appropriate equation. Within the same edited area, any sites at the same temperatures as the sample site references will have the same heat loss as the sampled site, as well. Also, the invention concerns utilization of a quantifying infrared thermal imager or a pyroelectric vidicon to obtain a detailed temperature profile for use in the heat loss equations. A profile heat flux is obtained either by use of traditional convection and radiation formulae, or by the principle of obtaining heat flux values for a larger area based on an incremental heat flux reference sample and an overall temperature profile as mentioned above. Algorithms are then employed which accurately consider the temperature value of each pixel defined on the thermal imager. Treating the pixels as finite elements for use in finite difference, finite element, other matrix forms, or algebraic equations for detailed analysis of all heat flow phenomenon within the system, and in particular for the study of surface heat loss by the method described by the incremental heat loss sample temperature profile procedure. Editing algorithms to delete pixels outside the area of interest can be employed as well. Present needs are served by an algorithm which allows specifying some rectangular portion of the overall image for heat loss study, deleting all pixels below and above selected minimum maximum temperatures of interest and then automatically identifying the unique temperatures within the remaining field, and counting the number of pixels at each unique temperature. Measured reference heat flux and temperature being two input variables, heat flux for the remaining unique temperature zone is then calculated. Areas can be quantified by several means, including trigonometrically from input lens angle and distance to the photographic target . Previously, a polar plainimeter has been utilized on photographs of temperature profile images or corresponding slide projections or computer printouts , examining the individual temperature profile bands to obtain areas of each thermal color zone. This process is tedious and very time consuming. According to the present invention the overall area of the study is input and an algorithm calculates the areas of the unique temperatures as a portion of the total area and determines the ratio of the number of pixels in each individual zone to the number of pixels in the overall image. Having the individual areas and the fluxes per unit area, the program computes hourly heat loss from each zone in BTU hr for the zone. Energy costs are known, and therefore the energy loss per hour is easily calculated. For energy loss and dollar loss per year, several alternatives are available. In this case, Q heat loss rate t₁ internal temperature t First, R is solved for each pixel for conditions at the time of the survey. Then the computer solves interactively for t An equation then provides the hourly heat loss based on local yearly average climate conditions. Yearly heat loss is then simply calculated by multiplying the yearly operating hours. Notice that many of the problems associated with traditional heat loss calculations seem to have been successfully addressed, but some error can be expected to remain due to inaccuracy in annualized assumption for the yearly loss projections. In part, this is due to both the radiative sink temperature assumption and to the fact that the equations for convective and radiative losses are not linear, so that loss calculations based on averaged climate conditions can always be expected to be less accurate than loss calculations done at many increments of time and climate conditions. For buildings and other systems near ambient temperature, a more sophisticated algorithm is required to obtain any useful yearly data. The features of this invention include combining the subject matter of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 above into an overall heat loss survey technology. The features hereof also include overall heat loss combining the subject matter of paragraphs 2 and 3 above in any fashion to obtain overall heat loss or heat loss of any increment larger than that sampled by the fluxmeter . Normally, the procedure outlined above is employed as a This concept addresses those problems still evident in the technique of Quick Heat Loss Field Surveys. Full range heat loss surveys can be complex procedures demanding the collection of large amounts of data on several different dates. Total heat survey costs may be high, even for relatively simple systems. For these reasons, this technique is especially useful for those systems which have both a demand for extraordinarily high accuracy of return on investment calculation and an expectation of high dollar returns. In cases where variable convection wind dependent is factors, this method is expected to prove useful as well. For all other cases, the Quick Heat Loss Survey technique proves much more practical and economical. A. A set of heat Loss Surveys is collected by the techniques described above . Data collections at other operating conditions could help to assure greater accuracy. In particular, if the system has a significant wind variation, more data will enhance return on investment accuracy. B. The next step is to produce an image or other graphic representation of the system overlaid with or otherwise defined by a finite element matrix with elements of two or more sizes. The element size is adjusted to limit the range of temperatures within any individual element. This is done in order to maintain accuracy of the calculations while reducing computer memory and process time requirements. Usually, the individual elements can be made considerably larger than matrix elements described by the pixel field of the original thermal image data. A computer routine automatically generates a matrix which will produce accurate results, based on the principle of iteratively reducing the size of the elements until each element contains only a specified narrow range of temperatures for either set of the collected data. Obviously, this condition will occur for some elements at a much larger physical size than it will occur for others. To save computer storage space and processing time, a matrix is generated which contains elements of more than one size. Several techniques exist for finite element calculation on matrices with elements of more than one size. This method provides an ongoing study of heat loss from a system. A tremendous amount of accurate heat loss data covering a great variety of ambient and operating conditions can be collected conveniently and easily. Two main applications are typical To generally describe the apparatus useful for practice of the present invention should not be viewed as limiting on the practice of the method steps as claimed below. For instance, one step is that of forming a thermal image of a structural surface. This can be executed routinely by using a camera which is a constructed and equipped to prepare a film providing an infrared image where the zones of the structural surface shown different colors or color intensities to hi light differences in temperature. This normally uses a film which is sensitive to radiant energy. The exposed image is thus subdivided into a number of energy zones which graphically illustrate surface temperature variations. The zones typically depict temperature ranges such as a range of 1 C or perhaps zones as broad as 25 C. This is a scale factor which can be varied depending on the needs. A thermal energy measuring device is also described. Such a flux meter was referenced earlier in the present disclosure and is the subject matter of a specified pending patent application. It is also possible to measure the surface area on the thermal images. A well known apparatus for accomplishing this a panimeter. For instance, the thermal image can be measured to define the surface area of a specified color coded region in the image. That will specify the total area of that particular temperature range. In some instances, it may be necessary to convert a thermal image into specific regions by trigonometric projection. If a photograph is made from a point of perspective where a square surface has the appearance of a square, scaling is made much easier. However, if the prospective point of the photographer does not so permit, trigonometric projections will be helpful to provide a corrected thermal image showing the surface area from an entirely different point of view, namely one in which the prospective point of the camera does not distort the image and thereby alter the surface area measurements or zones in the image. While the foregoing is directed to the preferred embodiment, the scope is determined by the claims which follow.
