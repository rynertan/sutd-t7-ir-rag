# Electrochromic display module and reflective projection system therefor.

## Abstract
A passive display module for use in a display system having a source of illumination and a projection lens includes a liquid filled cell having a transparent top 16 and a wall 15 surrounding a display electrode area. A side light guide, coextensive 12 with the display area, forms or abuts one wall of the cell and directs light from the source onto the display area. The guide has a reflective upper inclined surface 18 for reflecting light onto the display area and for preventing light from the source from escaping directly to the projection lens. A reflective coating 17 is also provided on an outer face of the remaining portion of the cell wall which is inclined inwardly to return escaping light to the system.
