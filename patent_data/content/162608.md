# Multi vehicle system involving on board apparatus for acquisitioning data indicative of vehicle operation.

## Abstract
The invention relates to an apparatus for accurately measuring the weight of a load carried by a truck body 13 which is mounted on a truck frame 15. The apparatus is lo cated along an interface between the truck frame 15 with the load carried by the truck body 13 and uniformly distributes the weight of the body onto the frame along the interface. In order to measure the weight of the load, the apparatus in cludes pressure sensors 51a d which communicate the entire weight of the load to the truck frame 15. The pressure sensors 51a d provide an electrical signal proportional to the pressure exerted by the load on the apparatus. This electrical signal is processed to calculate the weight of the load carried in the truck body. By providing a pressure sensing apparatus at an interface between the load and truck frame, the weight on the load carried by the truck body can be continually moni tored without interrupting the loading, hauling and dumping routine. A sensor processing unit 101 responds to the con tinually monitored weight data and the like to provide hauling parameters to track the performance of the truck and to pro vide a data base to a central computer from which data can be gathered for efficiently controlling the movement of a plurality of trucks.
