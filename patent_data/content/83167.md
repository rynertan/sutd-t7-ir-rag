## Description
FOAM FILM COEXTRUDED PLASTIC BAGS The invention relates to a colored and opaque plastic bag having a non foamed ply and a foamed ply. Most waste bags are made from thin films 0.025 0.050 mm .In pigmenting the bags, it is difficult to make them opaque. In coextrusion, each face of the film is only a fraction of the total thickness e.g., inner ply 75 , outer ply 25S . When an attempt is made to color each face a different color, one color may show through the other as it is impractical to use a high loading of colorant in films of this thickness. Certain problems associated with various prior art plastic bag structures may be described oy way of example. For instance, tall kitchen waste bags are often used as liners for waste receptacles which may be white or other light shades of color. In such use the interiors of tne bags are often folded over the top of the kitchen waste receptacle, thereby exposing for view the inner surface of the plastic bag over the lip of the receptacle. If the receptacle is white in color, it would be desirable for the exposed surface of the bag to also be white. Accordingly, it is desirable to provide waste bags with a light colored e.g., white interior or innermost surface. However, when the liner of the above mentioned kitchen waste receptacle becomes filled, the liner may then be removed from the receptacle and the top sealed to present a sealed bag containing waste materials. Since it is undesirable for the contents of the bag to be visible through the exterior surface of the bag structure, it is desirable for the bag to have a sufficient degree of opacity to obscure from vision the contents of the bag. In this regard, it is noted that darker colors, such as green or brown, tend to visually mask the interior contents of the bag more efficiently than ligher colors such as white or yellow. Accordingly, it is desiraole to provide a waste bag structure having at least one ply which has tne opacity normally associated with darker colored plies.Furthermore, when a filled waste bag is placed out of doors for sanitiation removal, it is desirable that the bag be relatively non visible or inconspicuous in the environment. This result is often better achieved when the visible exterior surface of the filled bag is relatively dark in color. Accordingly, there is a need to provide plastic bags which are opaque and have at least one light colored ply or which have plies of two different colors. However, as indicated previously, this result is difficult to achieve simply with pigment adjustments, because the color of darker plies may tend to show through lighter colored plies. The invention relates to an improved plastic bag structure having at least two plies. These plies correspond to coextruded, pigmented, thermoplastic and oriented films and may be formed by a blown film process. According to an aspect of the present invention, luster and opacity is imparted to the bag structure by interposing a foamed ply directly adjacent to a non foamed ply. The outermost or exterior ply of the bag structure may either be foamed or non foamed. The coextruded film corresponding to the foamed ply may be formed from a melt stream containing at least one foaming agent. The plies of the plastic bag structure may be formed in a manner analogous to known manners for forming bag structures which differ from those of the present invention in that they do not contain foamed plies. Preferably, however, one or more suitable foaming agents may be incorporated into the melt stream corresponding to the foamed ply. Examples of such foaming agents, sufficient foaming amounts of such agents and methods of foaming with such agents are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,893,957. The coextruded thermoplastic films utilized in accordance with the present invention may be of the same ordifferent composition but are preferably composed of polyolefins. Preferred polyolefins are polyethylene homopolymers and copolymers e.g., formed from at least about 75 by weight of ethylene monomers . A particularly preferred form of polyethylene is linear low density polyethylene, which has the strength characteristics suitable for maKing waste bags which are characterized as tall trash bags. Examples of linear low density polyethylenes are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,076,698. The bags made in accordance with the present invention may be 2 ply or 3 ply. Such 3 ply bags may be made from a coextrusion of three films, whereby a foamed ply becomes sandwiched in between two non foamed plies. Bags produced in accordance with the present invention may have an overall thickness of from 0.013 to 0.13 mm, more preferably, from 0.025 to 0.075 mm. The thickness of the foamed ply may be, for example, from about 30 to about 85 of the thickness of the bag. The color of the innermost ply of the bag may be the same or different from the color of the outermost ply of the bag. Also, when three or more plies are present each ply may have the same or different colors. By suitably positioning a foamed ply, it is possible to have plies which are dark color such as brown or green and other plies which are light in color such as white or yellow, without the dark color of the dark plies substantially showing througn the lighter colored plies. For example, in two ply systems the foamed ply may be a lighter color and the unfoamed ply may be a darker color. Plies which are dark in color may be characterized as being capable of masKing the color of a lighter colored ply when the darker colored ply is interposed between the lighter colored ply and the viewer s eye. Unfoamed plies which are light in color may be characterized as not being capable of masking the color of a darker colored ply when this lighter colored ply is interposed between the darker colored ply and the viewer s eye. Thus, as used herein with respect to the colors of plies, the terms dark and light are relative terms. According to an aspect of this invention, b foaming one layer, because of the large difference in refractive index between air or other gas and polymer, good hiding power is obtained. Thus, lighter colors may be used in foamed plies, and such light colored foamed plies may still be caPable of masking the color of darker plies. Furthermore, because of the way blown films are made, considerable orientation is obtained in the final blown film. More particularly, this orientation arises as a result of the blown film process, whereby melt streams expand as they pass through the extrusion orifice to form a tubular coextruded film. This orientation may cause the film to take on a more pleasing sheen or appearance. Depending on the use of the bag, the foamed layer can be either on the inside or outside. Although the coextruded, oriented films described herein with respect to certain aspects of the present invention have been described as being useful for producing plastic bag structures, it is noted that these films may have utility in other areas such as a food packaging material or as a decorative wrap material. For example, such a three ply film having a foamed inner ply sandwiched between two non foamed outer plies might provide a film having a rich looKing, lustrous satin appearance, provided that these outer non foamed plies are at least semi transparent.
