# AIR FLOW CONTROL APPARATUS

## Abstract
An air flow control apparatus is disclosed which is characterized by essentially zero leakage in its closed position, and by minimal air resistance in its open position. The apparatus includes a housing 12 having an interior framework which defines a plurality of troughs 21 of V shaped cross section, and with each side of each trough including an opening 34 . A closure is associated with each trough, which includes a pair of pivotally mounted plates 39, 40 which are movable between a spread apart position covering and closing the openings in the trough, and a collapsed position wherein the plates are substantially aligned with each other and spaced from the associated openings to permit free air flow therethrough. A continuous upstanding peripheral flange 28, 30, 31, 32 surrounds each opening, and a resilient pad 44 is mounted on each plate of each closure so that the resilient pad mates with the outer edge of the flange when the closure is moved to the spread apart position, and so that the outer edge presses into the resilient pad to effect an air tight seal. The axis 41 of the pivotal plates is adjustable to permit the pressure between the plates and outer edge of the flanges to be uniform about the periphery of each opening.
