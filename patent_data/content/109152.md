## Abstract
A game 10 has counters movable along pathways on a playing area 22 in which the pathways can be moved or al tered. A particular form comprises a base 12 and a plural ity of concentric rings 24a j thereon some or all of the rings being rotatable in relation to one another and the base, and the rings carrying indicia 26, 28 whereby to define path ways. Counters may be moved from a starting point 14, 16 18 or 20 toward a home area 32 according to the length of pathway in front of them as determined by the movement or alteration caused in playing that turn of the game or of the immediately preceding turn.

## Description
GAMEThis invention relates to a game. rLany types of board game are available involving different levels of skill but they generally have in common a fixed board and lovable counters which are moved by the players in accordance with the throw of a dice or other randomising factor.In accordance with the invention a game is provided having counters movable along pathways on a playing area in which the pathways in the playing area themselves can be moved or altered. one ane preferred foim of the invention the playing area comprises a tase and, on the base, a plurality of concentric rings, some or all of the rings being rotatable in relation to one another and the base, and te rings carrying indicia whereby to define pathways. Another form of the invention may comprise a playing area having a base upon which are 2 series of rectilinear bands some or 211 of which are able axially with respect to one another end tbe base, the bands carrying indicia whereby to define pathways. P ser forms of geometrical construction are also in the ambit of the invention, for example a cylindrical playing surface having relatively movable circumferencial bands. The portion of the playing surface defining the pathways may chemselves be physically movable so as to alter the pathways defined, or may comprise a fixed window through which lights or other electrically operated indicia may be displayed, the indicia being alterable in response to given actuations to be equivalent to manual movement of a mechanically movable playing surface.In essence the games playable with the apparatus of the invention will consist in moving from a starting point to a home along one or more of the pathways indicated on the playing surface, the pathways being subject to change in the course of play according to predetermined rules or according to a random factor such as the throw of a dice.The game may be played as a form of solitaire or may be played competitively with two or more players competing against one another simultaneo sly. To this end, each player will be provided with one or more counters, pegs, or otter markers so as to be able to indicate the current state of play.The playing area carries indicia to indicate pathways. The inlicia could be, for ezazle, bands or segments which are differentiated by colour, by symbols, by letters or numerals, by texture, or any other desired way The invention will be described further, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which the sole figure is a diagrammatic top plan view of a playing arsa in accordance with the present invention.Referring to the drawing, the game board generally designated 10 comprises a base portion 12 which is stationary with respect to the table or other support on which the game s to be played, and which curries four starting points 14, 16, 18, 20. On the base 12 a playing area generally indicated at 22 comprises ten concentric rings 24a j. Each of the rings 24a j i8 rotatable relative to each other and to the base 12.Each of the rings 24a j is divided into twenty segments half of which shown dark shaded in the drawing are designated barriers 26 and half of which shown blank in the drawing are pathway segments 28 which can carry indicia as described more fully hereinafter. Within the concentric s there is a fixed, relative to the base 12, central portion 30 which contains four home areas 32 corresponding to each of the starting points 14, 16, 18 and 20.In the particular form of the invention illustrated, the pathway segments 28 Cre differentiated as follows. The segments 28 on the ring 24a my be coloured red, those on the ring 24b may be coloured blue, those on the ring 24c may be coloured green, those on the ring 24d may be coloured yellow, and those on the ring 24e may be coloured grey.This sequence of colours may be repeated for the segments 28 on the rings 24f to 24j,In order to pl X the e foz which the board described above is designed, six counters may be provided for each of the four players starting from the respective starting points 14, 16, 18, 20 and five dice y be provi etch coloured to correspond with the colours of the rings 24. A starting position may be determined to give no one player an advantage over the others. Within each of the starting areas 14, 16, 18, 20 a scoring area 34 may be provided which may take the form of a peg board into which pegs may be placed to keep the score.The detailed instructions for playing the one game utilising the configuration described above follow as an example, but in brief a player moves a cotter on to the outer ring 24a when a segment 28 rather than a barrier 26 is adjacent his starting point. By throwing the coloured dice he nust move one of the coloured rings corresponding to each die by the number indicated thereon in an attempt to line up a pathway of coloured segments 28 in a radial direction towards the centre 30 and home 32. Having moved the rinas in accordance with the dice, he moves his counter radially inwards until it meets a barrier segment 26. On his next throw he moves this counter further towards the centre if possible. At the end of a turn he may bring a further counter into play according to the configuration of rings. Wrnere two or more players are involved, the intervening moves by other players will alter the loca tion of the first player s counters and he will have to reassess his next move in the light of this. It is envisaged that forms of the game in which counters are not expressly necessary may be devised, for example where the pathway segments 28 carry numerical or alphabetical indicia and the object of the game is to le up a particular word or mathematical function such as a number or simple equation. In another form of the invention, the moves may be made according to a predetermined pattern rather than by the throw of a dice or other randomiser. Obviously the umber of rings 2G and the number of segments, 26, 28 can be varied allowing for more or less starting positions to acconiodate more or less players and to increase or decrease the difficulty of the game. Furthermore, not all the rings, 24 need be relativeLy movable, some rings may be fixed and such fixed rings may, for example, carry more barrier segments 26 to provide a fixed barrier which each of the players must surmount on their route towards the centre. Also, each of the rings 24 need not carry an equal number of segments 26,28 a the proportion of segments 26 and 28 may vary from ring to ring. Instead of the mechanically moving rings 24, each of the segments 28 and 26 could comprise windows under which lights or other electronic indicia are placed which can be controlled to turn any given segment into a Marriertor to a tpathwayt of any given indicia.Thus it is envisaged that the g e could, without departing from this invention, be played on a screen utilising a microprocessor or other form of electronic computing apparatus. In this case the randomising may be electronic also and may be used directly to alter the indicia of the relative dispositions of the segments, or the player may have, as with the above game, a measure of control as to how the instructions given are carried into effect.The invention is further illustrated in the following example.EXAMPLEUtilising a board as illustrated in the accompanying drawing and described hereinabove each player is given a set of six tokens each set showing a number correspond nMg with the number on the respective starting areas. Bive coloured dice are provided each colour to correspond with one of the colours of the rings 24. Each player has twelve scoring pegs, six white and six black and a single marker peg for use during longer gazes to denote whose turn it is after a recess. The game, hereinafter referred to as Mandalat is then played as follows. The Ob iect of Mandala The object of the game is to manoeuvre your tokens from the outer red ring to the centre by moving from colour to colour whilst avoiding black segments which cannot be entered or passed. Movement of your tokens must be in a straight line towards the centre and so, having thrown the dice, skill and judgement will be required to rotate the rings in such a way as to move any obstructing black segments out of the way thus creating a pathway of coloured stepping stones towards the centre.How to play Mandala.1. Setting un Each player should choose a corner and consequently a number, this number being retained throughout the game. A set of tokens should be given to each player according to their number, the ultimate aim being to advance tokens to any of the four home sections in the centre.The rings must be initially positioned in such a way that the white segment separating strip on each ring that is marked by a black diamond, aligns with the small white star located just outside of the outer red ring between starting areas one and four. This action will effectively scramble the rings to reduce any element of advantage.Each player should now place one token onto the red segment that is adjacent to their starting area. The player elected to go first now begins. 2. The throw of the dice When the dice have been thrown, the numbers resulti will determine the number of segments that you must rotate OES of the correspondingly coloured rings. It will prove beneficial to, once a ring has been rotated, put the appropriate die to one side to avoid confusing what has or has not been rotated. 3. The rotation of the rings Each die instructs the rotation of ONE of its correspondingly coloured rings. You must rotate the EXACT number of segments thrown, either to the left or to the right, having decided which of the two rings to rotate for maximum advantage. One ring of each colour MUSU be rotated during every turn, the only exception to this rule being in the event of the dice instructing zero.4. The advancement of tokens When all the rings of your choice have been rotated, it is time to advance your token or, in later stages, tokens as far as your skill at rotating the rings will allow. You may advance your token in a straight line, never sideways or backwards, from wherever it is now until it is obstructed by a black segment which it must not enter or pass.When one or more of your tokens are aligned with any of the four homey sections, providing there are no black segments in the way, they may proceed those. Whenever you succeed in reaching this section, the token should immediately be returned to your starting area, to be re introduced. Tokens that are not correctly aligned must be advanced as far as possible towards the centre, to be we aligned during subsequent turns. Sniping During later stages of the game and having created a pathway or pathways avoiding black segments, there may be further obstacles in the form or either your own, or your opponent s, tokens. A segment may never be occupied by more than one token, so your own tokens must be advanced as far as possible but remaining behind each other. However, when opponents tokens get in your way, they can be 1sniped and returned to the appropriate players starting area. Your token will then be free to advance as far as it can go.You can tsnipe any number of tokens that are in your pathways providing no black segments block your progress. Sniping is a tactic that can quite easily become habit forming.It will not always be possible to advance one or more tokens due to being totally blocked, and although this will not happen often, it is an opportunity to at the rotating of the rings stage rotate so as to cause maximum inconvenience to other players. You may get as many tokens home in one turn as you make possible. 5. The introduction of tokens The final act of a turn is to hopefully introduce ONE fresh token to the playing area. If, BETTER advancing your tokens, you find that you have a red segment adjacent to your starting area, you may introduce a token to it under the following conditions a. It is empty b. It is occupied by an opponents token you simply snipe it .During your rotation of the rings it is wise to assess whether you wish to introduce a token, and rotate accordingly. A token is always introduced at the end of a turn and cannot be advanced until the playerts next turn. It is possible to have a maximum of six tokens in play simultaneously, Scoring and Wining the Game of MandalaScoring is by use of white and black pegs in conjunction with the scoring system that is located within each players starting area.A game consists in getting six tokens home . The first player to achieve this should be declared to be the winner. However, shorter games are possible simply by deciding beforehand how many homes to aim for and you will be able to extend play to a match of up to six games by using the peg numbering system.Each time a player reaches home , a white peg is placed into the scoring area until all six holes are filled. When six are achieved the pegs are removed and a black peg positioned into the lower section. Each player will, by using this method, be able to see precisely what stage of the game their opponents have reached. By the time the first player has a second turn, their token will almost certainly be in a totally different place due to other players rotations. The more tokens there are in play, the more important it will be to consider your movement of the rings to achieve the greatest advantage. The shape of the game will change at every turn, making the probability of playing two identical games of Mandala extremely unlikely.Alternatively the barriers 28 and the segments 26 can be reversed.
