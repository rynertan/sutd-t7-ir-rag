# Receiver for FM signals with transmitter status code storage.

## Abstract
In a receiver for FM signals, more specifically a car ra dio, the tuning data for those FM transmitters which trans mit the same program are stored in addressable memory locations of a first memory field 13 1 . In order to be contin uously tuned to the best receivable transmitter a second memory field 13 2 is provided, which comprises in each of the addressable locations a status code word ST which is unambiguously associated with a turning datum fr. . . These status code words are produced by a status circuit 10 to which the intermediate frequency signal is applied. A control circuit 9 starts at regular intervals an up date cy cle during which the receiver is tuned to a number of trans mitters whose tuning data are stored in the first memory field. In each tuning action a new status code word is deter mined to replace the original status code word. Thereafter the new status code words are checked against a predeter mined criterion and the receiver is tuned to that transmitter whose associated status code word satisfies that criterion to the highest extent.
