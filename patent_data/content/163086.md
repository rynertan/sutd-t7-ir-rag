# Thermally actuated rocket motor safety system.

## Abstract
A thermally actuated rocket motor safety system has a fire temperature pyrotechnic sensor which ignites a gas generator 30 which drives piston 38 to the left. Firing pin 40 strikes the primer in transfer booster assembly 42 . The transfer booster assembly transmits explosive energy through window 54 in now open block ring 50 to initiate charge 62 which lies adjacent the rocket motor case. This stresses the rocket motor case by producing a stress raising notch in the case wall. Subsequent grain burning opens the case to vent the rocket motor pressure. Inertia mass 70 slides to the right upon acceleration due to normal rocket motor firing and locks in the rightmost position by means of latch 82 . In the locked position, inertia mass 70 prevents leftward motion of the firing pin 40 .
