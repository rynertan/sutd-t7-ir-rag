# SOLENOID VALVE

## Abstract
A three way solenoid valve uses armature 18 housed in a coaxial sleeve 26 and having longitudinal fluid channels 36 on its outer surface and a fluid sealing element 21, 24 on both ends. A first fluid sealing element 14 on a first end of the armature is a resilient ring arranged to cooperate with an adjacent fluid orifice 12 in a valve body 2 to peripheral ly seal the fluid orifice in response to spring pressure exerted by a spring 28 acting on the first end 16 of the armature in a first position of the armature 18 during a deenergized state of the valve. The armature 18 is provided with a coaxial longitudinal bore 20 aligned with the center hole 15 in the fluid sealing ring 14 . During the deenergized state of the valve, a fluid path is provided between a first fluid port 8 and second fluid port 35 in the valve body 2 via the hole 15 in the sealing ring 14 , the bore 20 in the armature 18 and the channels 36 on the armature 18 . During an energized state of the valve, the armature 18 is repositioned to a second position to effect a seal between the fluid sealing element 24 on the second end of the armature 18 and a fixed plug 27 in the valve to interrupt the fluid path along the channels 36 on the armature 18 . In this state of the valve, the sealing ring 14 is separated from the adjacent fluid orifice 12 to provide a fluid path between the first fluid port 8 and a third fluid port 6 . A rolling diaphragm seal 30 is arranged between the armature 18 and the valve body 2 to isolate the second port 35 from the first and third ports 6, 8 .
