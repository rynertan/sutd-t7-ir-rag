# Polymerization catalyst, production and use.

## Abstract
Ethylene and alpha olefins are homopolymerized or copolymerized with another olefin monomer in the presence of a catalyst system comprising an organo metal cocatalyst and a titanium containing catalyst component, said titanium containing catalyst component being obtained by reacting together a porous particulate material, an organic magne sium compound, an oxygen containing compound, an acyl halide, titanium tetrachloride and C1₂, Br₂ or an interhalogen compound and treating the solids with an organometallic compound of a Group IIa, IIb or IIIa metal.
