## Description
DESCRIPTIONAPPARATUS FOR RUNNERLESS INJECTION COMPRESSION MOLDING THERMOSETTING MATERIALS The present invention relates to improved apparatus for injection molding thermosetting materials and, more particularly, to injection molding of thermosetting synthetic resin compositions. Injection molding is an advantageous method of forming articles of synthetic resin. In general terms, injection molding is a process wherein the molding composition, in a melted or plasticized state, is injected into the mold cavity. Typically, cold molding composition in granular form is fed from a hopper into a heated cylinder containing a screw. The molding composition is heated, melted and plasticized on the screw flights, and then the screw, acting as a ram, injects the melted and plasticized material into a mold cavity. In the case of thermosetting material, the molded material is cured in the mold by compaction and by heat added to the mold cavity. After curing, the article is ejected from the mold and the process repeated. Injection molding offers the advantages of reduced molding cycles, better control of process variables, and increased productivity as compared with conventional compression and transfer molding processes.The major disadvantage with the injection molding of thermosetting materials is the generation of a considerable amount of waste material, particularly when multiple cavity systems are employed. The waste material is generated by thermosetting material that has cured, become infusible, in the runner and sprue systems and cannot be reused. The amount of non reusable waste material generated in this fashion can be substantial, ranging tpici ly from about 15 to about 80 percent of the total afiiount of material required to mold an article. A recent technical advance in the molding art has been the adaptation of the runnerless injection, or cold manifold, process to the injection molding of thermosetting resins. In the cold manifold process, the material in the sprue and manifold system is maintained at a temperature sufficient to maintain the material in a plasticized condition, without causing the material to prematurely cure of set up . Thus, when a cured part S removed from the mold cavity, the material in the sprue and manifold becomes part of the next molding, instead of being discarded as in conventional injection molding operations. The runnerless injection process, therefore, provides for significant savings in material. The thermosetting materials usually employed in runnerless injection processes differ in some respects from materials normally employed in conventional injection processes because of the different requirements of each process. One significant difference is that a runnerless injection material is adapted to remain in a plasticized or fused condition in the feed system for extended periods of time without prematurely curing, usually at temperatures between about 104 and about 116 C. 220 to 240 F. while also being capable of rapidly curing in the mold cavity at the molding temperature, usually about 1700C. 340OF. . Although such formulations are useful in the present invention, they are not required, and the molding compositions presently utilized may be selected from the more economical and more readily available standard thermosetting molding compositions. An example of a suitable runnerless injection molding composition comprises a phenol aldehyde resin component wherein a from 55 to 90 of the available theoretical para phenyl linkages in the resin chain are bridged to a phenyl group, b the carbon chains linked between adjacent hydroxyl substituted phenyl nuclei have 1 to 5 carbon atoms, and c the hydroxyl substituted phenyl nuclei are capable of chain growth at unsubstituted ortho and para positions of said nuclei see U.K. Patent Application No. 7919670 . Thermosetting molding materials useful in the present invention may suitably be selected from the thermosetting synthetic resins and resin compositions typically used in molding operÅations, for example, phenolic amino, such as, urea, melamine and melamine phenolic polyester resins in granular, nodular, bulk or sheet forms, alkyl epoxy silicone diallylphthalate polyamides or from thermosetting natural and synthetic rubber compositions. Phenolic resin compositions are especially useful as the molding material. Phenolic resin compositions used in molding operations are usually employed in the form of molding compositions.Phenolic molding compositions typically are particulate in form containing a molding grade phenolic resin, a cross linking agent, such as hexamethylenetetramine, and suitable filler materials. Conventional reciprocating screw type molding machines have a feed unit comprised of a nozzle member mounted on the front of a heated barrel. A reciprocal and rotatable screw is positioned within the barrel.The rotating motion of the screw plasticizes a thermosetting molding material within the barrel.Subsequently, a reciprocating motion of the screw, acting as a ram, feeds the itiied molding material through the nozzle member, through a runner system, into closed mold. The mold is heated to a temperature sufficiently high to cure the molding material. The technique of injection compression molding basically consists of injecting a charge of plasticized molding material into a partially open mold the final fill, or mold fit, is accomplished by a separate step, the subsequent complete closure of the mold. Injection compression molding makes possible a combination of the positive attributes of compression molding, i.e., improved dimensional stabiTity, uniform density, low shrinkage and impact strength, with the automation and fast cure of injection molding. The present invention provides an improved apparatus for adapting the advantages of injection compression molding to include the advantage of runnerless injection techniques and facilitates the use of standard, less costly, phenolic molding composition in such apparatus. GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides an improved molding apparatus for i nj ecti on compression molding of thermosetting molding materials.The apparatus comprises a stationary platen assembly, a moveable platen assembly and a feed nozzle assembly. The stationary assembly is comprised of a stationary platen member, or support plate, a heated plate mounted on the support plate and a plurality of mold faces mounted on the heat plate.In one mode of the invention, the heated plate is provided with a temperature controlled sleeve member positioned therein. The sleeve member is adapted to receive the feed nozzle therethrough and separate the feed nozzle from the heated plate. The moveable assembly is comprised of a moveable platen member, or support plate, a heated plate mounted thereon and a plurality of mold faces mounted on the heat plate corresponding to and adapted to be aligned with the mold faces on the stationary assembly to form mold cavities. The feed or injection, nozzle assembly is comprised of a nozzle member, preferably cylindrical in shape, having a closed end and an open end. The open end is preferably fitted with standard threads to facilitate attachment of the nozzle member to the feed barrel of a conventional screw type molding machine.The nozzle member has a temperature controlling means disposed therein, and has a plurality of feed outlets or orifices positioned along the outside periphery of the nozzle member near the closed end. The temperature maintained in the nozzle member is sufficiently high to maintain the thermosetting molding material within the nozzle member in a plasticized state and sufficiently low that no substantial curing or setting up of the thermosetting molding material takes place. By substantial curing or settingup of the thermosetting molding material is meant the amount of premature polymerization which would adversely inhibit the plasticity or mobility of the molding material. In the injection, or feed, stage the moveable assembly is positioned to bring the mold faces on the moveable assembly into close proximity with the corresponding and aligned mold faces on the stationary assembly to form partially open mold cavities.Thermosetting molding material in a plasticized state is then fed through the nozzle member, through runner channels, into the partially open, heated, mold cavities. The heated mold cavities are then closed completely by further movement, suitably by hydraulic means, of the moveable assembly in a direction toward the stationary assembly. This movement cuts off further feed of thermosetting material by closing off the runner channels. The thermosetting material ithin the confines of the mold faces is thus pressed and heated to a temperature sufficiently high to cure the material. After curing, the moveable assembly is retracted, moved away from the stationary assembly, suitably by hydraulic means, to remove the molded article and provide access to the mold face and surrounding area. The small amount of cured material in the runner channel is the only loss. The thermosetting material remaining in the nozzle and barrel is maintained in a plasticized, substantially uncured, state, ready for the next shot or filling operation. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention will illustrated and more fully described by reference to the accompanying drawings. Figure 1 is a cross sectional, partly schematic view of an apparatus of the present invention. The apparatus shown is a portion of an injection molding machine having a horizontal clamping arrangement. As shown in Figure 1, the apparatus is in the injection or feed stage of the molding cycle. In this stage, thermosetting molding material is fed into partially open molds. Figure 2 shows the apparatus of Figure 1 in the compression stage. In this stage the molds are completely closed. The thermosetting material within the confines of the closed mold during this stage is pressed and heated to cure the enclosed material to the shape of the mold cavity. Figure 3 shows the apparatus of Figure 1 in an open position.In this position the moveable platen assembly has been actuated to move in a direction away from the stationary platen assembly, allowing the removal of the molded articles from the open mold faces and facilitating the cleaning of the mold faces and surrounding area in preparation for repositioning the components in the feed stage as shown in Figure 1. Figure 4 is an axial cross sectional view showing the feed nozzle assembly of Figures 1, 2 and 3 in detail. Looking now at Figure 1, thermosetting molding material is fed into feed hopper 11 and then into plasticizing zone formed by heated barrel 13 and by the mechanical working of screw 15.A predetermined amount of plasticized molding material is subsequently injected by screw 15, acting as a ram, through nozzle member 17, through feed outlets, such as 19, runner channels, such as 21, into mold cavities, such as 23, formed by partially open mold faces, such as 25 and 27. The stationary assembly is comprised of stationary platen or support plate 29 which has stationary heat plate 31 mounted thereon. Suitably, heat plate 31 is separated from platen 29 by a layer of insulation 33, e.g., insulating board. Heat plate 31 has a plurality of mold faces, such as 25, mounted thereon. Heat plate 31 may suitably be heated by the circulation of steam or hot oil therethrough, but more preferably, electrically. Heat plate 31 supplies heat to mold faces, such as 25. The temperature maintained on the mold faces is sufficiently high that, when combined with the pressure generated when the mold is completely closed, will cure or set the thermosetting material within the mold cavity.Temperatures in a range of between about 1350 and about 2160 C. 2750 to 4250 F. are generally useful, and, within that range, temperatures between about 1490 and about 1990 C. 3000 to 3900 F. are particularly useful for a wide variety of thermosetting mold materials. In a preferred embodiment, stationary heat plate 31 is provided with a temperature controlled insert, or sleeve member 35. Sleeve member 35 is positioned to insulate nozzle member 17 from heat plate 31. The temperature in sleeve member 35 is controlled by the circulation of a fluid, such as water, at the desired temperature through channels, such as 37. The temperature n sleeve member 35 is maintained below the temperature at which any substantial curing of the thermosetting molding material will occur and sufficiently high to maintain the thermosetting material in a plasticized condition. Temperatures below which any substantial curing takes place are temperatures which are sufficiently low that the fluidity of the plasticized thermosetting feed material is not permanently affected.Generally, temperatures in the range of between about 770 and about 1210 C. 170t to 2500 F. are useful, and, temperatures from about 990 to about 1160 C. 210 to 940 F. are preferably maintained. The moveable assembly consists of moveable platen, or support plate 39 which has heat plate 41 mounted thereon and moveable therewith. Heat plate 41 has a plurality of mold faces, such as 27, mounted thereon, positioned to align in register with corresponding mold faces, such as 25, of the stationary platen assembly. Support blocks, such as 45, 47 and 49, are suitably utilized between platen 39 and heat plate 41 to insulate platen 39 from heat plate 41. The moveable assembly is adapted to be moved reciprically, as a unit, by means not shown, but suitably hydraulically, in and out of aligned contact with the stationary platen assembly. Moveable heat plate 41 is suitably heated by the circulation of steam or heated oil therethrough, but, more practically, electrically, to maintain a temperature on the mold faces, such as 27, comparable to that maintained on the corresponding mold faces, such as 25, that is, a temperature sufficiently high to cure the thermosetting material upon complete closure of the mold faces. Mold faces, such as 27, are provided with runner channels, such as 21, connecting the mold cavities with feed outlets, such as 19, of nozzle member 17 when the apparatus components are positioned in the injection stage of the molding cycle as shown in Figure 1. In a preferred embodiment, moveable heat plate 41 is provided with a temperature controlled area therein. The temperaturecontrolled area is positioned to be aligned with, and contiguous to the closed end of nozzle member 17 when the mold faces are in a fully closed position. The temperature controlled area is provided by a temperature controlled plate 51. Plate 51 has an internal reservoir, suitably comprised of internal connected channels 53, having an inlet 55 and an outlet 56 to receive and circulate a supply of liquid, e.g., water, at the desired temperature. Plate 51 is preferably separated from direct contact with heat plate 41 along adjacent face thereof by spacers, such as 57, and is provided with rubber sealing gasket 58.Temperature controlled plate 51 is maintained at a temperature lower than that at which any substantial curing of the thermosetting molding material will occur, but sufficiently high that the thermosetting molding material will remain in a plasticized state. Generally, temperatures between about 770 and about 1210 C. 170 to 2500 F. are utilized, and, within that range, temperatures between about 990 and about 1160 C. 210 to 2400 F. are aptly suited. The plasticized molding material fills the mold cavity formed by partially open mold faces 25 and 27. The distance the mold faces move from a partially open position to a fully closed position generally ranges between about 0.06 and about 0.50 inches and, more preferably, between about 0.10 and about 0.2 inches. This distance is also the clearance through the runner channels, such as 19, through which the thermosetting molding material passes from nozzle 17 to the mold cavities. The stationary assembly is provided with runner channels, such as 21.The moveable assembly is equipped with corresponding runner cutoffs, such as 43, positioned to fit within and block flow through the runner channels when the molds are in a fully closed position.Openings less than about 0.06 inches usually do not allow an easy flow of the molding material through the runner channels, and openings greater than about 0.50 inches frequently yield an excess of flash in the area around the mold faces upon closure of the molds Figure 2 shows the apparatus of Figure 1 in a closed or compression stage of the molding cycle. Moveable platen assembly has moved toward the stationary platen assembly to close aligned mold faces, such as 25 and 27, and runner cut offs, such as 43, have moved to block runner channels, such as 21. Thermosetting molding material previously fed into the space between the partially open mold faces is pressed and heated to cure the enclosed material to the internal shape of the mold. Figure 3 shows the apparatus of Figure 1 in an open position.In this position, the moveable platen assembly has been retracted, moved away from the stationary assembly. The molded articles, for example, 83, are removed from the molds, suitably by the aid of knock out pins, not shown, usually positioned in the moveable mold faces. In this position, any flash is removed, the channel and mold face areas are cleaned if necessary, and the components readied for repositioning as shown in Figure 1. At the point shown in Figure 3, the thermosetting molding material in the nozzle and barrel is stored in a plasticized, substantially uncured state in preparation for the next shot or injection of thermosetting material into the mold cavities. Figure 4 shows the feed nozzle assembly of the present invention in detail. Nozzle member 17 consists of housing 59, pre terably cylindrical in shape, having open end 61 and closed end 63. The open end is adapted to be connected to the feed barrel of a conventional screw type molding machine, suitably by thread means 65. Nozzle member 17 has an internal chamber 67, formed by closed end 63 and the interior face of housing 59. Internal chamber 67 has a constricted chamber portion, or zone, 69, formed by a narrowing of a portion of the internal wall of housing 59 intermediate the open end 61 and closed end 63.Nozzle 17 is equipped with a temperature controlled means comprised of a reservoir, comprised of channel or channels 71, in the thickened wall portion of housing 59, and preferably encircling constricted zone 69. Suitably, reservoir 71 has an inlet 73 and an outlet 75 for circulating a liquid, e.g., water of the desired temperature, through reservoir 71. The temperature of the circulating fluid is adjusted to maintain a temperature in the nozzle member sufficiently high to keep thermosetting molding material within the nozzle in a plasticized state and sufficiently low that no substantial curing or setting up of the material occurs.Usually, temperatures between about 770 and about 1210 C. 170 to 2500 F. and, within that range, temperatures between about 990 and about 1160 C. 210 to 2400F. are useful for a wide variety of thermosetting materials. Nozzle 17 has a plurality of feed outlets, or orifices, such as 19, connected to internal chamber 67 and positioned around the periphery thereof contiguous to closed end 63. Each feed outlet is adapted to be aligned with a runner channel to feed thermosetting molding material from nozzle member 17 into a, mold cavity. Nozzle member 17 preferably has a material distribution means comprised of flattened conical member 81 suitably threadably affixed to the internal face of closed end 63 of housing 59. Thermosetting molding material passes over conical member 81 and is directed axially outward in an even f ow through feed outlets, such as 19, which are preferably positioned around the periphery of flattened conical member 81. The apparatus components are preferably fabricated of mold steels selected to withstand the conditions of use. It will be understood that the present invention provides for the employment of a plurality of mold cavities fed by a single nozzle member. The drawings contemplate, but do not show, additional mold capacity fed by feed orifices, such as 85, through additional runner channels, such as 87. Preferably, the molds positioned around the periphery of the feed nozzle are balanced, that is, each of the molds requires equal amounts of plasticized material for filling. For purposes of simplicity, the present invention has been described in terms of a horizontal clamping arrangement however, it will be appreciated and understood that the invention is equally adapted to, and useful in, vertical clamping arrangements. The foregoing description and embodiments are intended to illustrate the invention without limiting it thereby. It will be appreciated that various modifications can be made in the invention without departing from the spirit or scope thereof. In the above described drawings the visible edges and exposed surfaces behind the cutting plane have been omitted in the vicinity of the mold cavities to simplify the drawings and facilitate the understanding of the apparatus of the invention.
