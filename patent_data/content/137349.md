# Dual in line connector assembly.

## Abstract
A dual in line connector assembly of the closed entry, closed bottom type having an intergral structure comprised of a base and a body of closely conforming configuration. The integral assembly defines a number of socket areas arranged in two parallel rows which communicate with a flux rinsing drainage system comprising a plurality of drainage paths of two different configurations which lead to orifices in the assembly exterior located away from the contacts. Drainage paths of the first type include a drainage chute in the socket area floor which lead directly to the exterior via an opening in the bottom of the drainage chute. The second type of drainage path includes a similar drainage chute leading to a large drainage opening that communicates with an extended oval shaped centered recess which contributes a dual function of effecting a snap on locking assembly arrangement. The drainage system includes a large intercon nection space which enables each pair of adjacent contacts to be served by both configurations of drainage paths. The contacts have question mark like configuration in which the upper portion is arranged in the respective socket area to effect a spring loaded contact with the lead of an integrated circuit such that a gas tight high pressure connection is achieved therebetween. The contact structure itself pre cludes permanent deformation of the upper free end during insertion of the IC lead and the socket area housing is shaped to prevent its dislodgement during IC lead removal.
