# Antenna arrangement for personal radio transceivers.

## Abstract
An antenna arrangement is disclosed for personal radio transceivers in which a main antenna 1 extends out from the housing 3 of the transceiver excited by the high frequency connector thereof and an auxiliary antenna 4 is coupled to the cold terminal of the connector to form a counterweight to the main antenna 1 . Both the main and auxiliary antennas 1, 4 are resonant and shorter than the quarterwave length, whereby the housing 3 gets to a potential minimum and the effects of the close presence of the human body on the radiational properties will be reduced.
