# Conversion process.

## Abstract
Process for the production of synthesis gas and hydro carbons in which a saturated hydrocarbon and an oxygen containing gas having a ratio of hydrocarbon to oxygen of greater than the stoichiometric ratio for complete combus tion are introduced together with hydrogen into a bed of particulate material. The upward flow rate of the gases is sufficiently large to fluidise or to cause a spouting action of the bed material. The hydrocarbon, oxygen containing gas and hydrogen are ignited and reacted together and the prdoucts of the reaction are withdrawn.
