# Electric cable glands.

## Abstract
In a cable gland comprising two tubular members 6, 12 each wider at one end than at the other and telescopically engageable at their respective wider ends to define an annular chamber 15 around a cable end inserted through the telescoped members with means 11, 14 for urging the, tubular members axially together after the chamber has been filled with an appropriate sealing compound, at least one resilient contact finger 4 is in electrical continuity with one of the tubular members and projects inwardly in order to make effective contact with a corrugated sheath 1 or other metallic layer of the cable. The contact finger s is are thus effectively embedded in the sealing compound, and locked in position when it sets, so giving a secure contact as well as an effective fluid tight seal.
