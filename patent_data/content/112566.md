# Process for manufacturing universal joint.

## Abstract
A process for manufacturing a universal joint mainly by cold forging is disclosed which comprises of a blanking step a to punch a blank having a pair of fork mem ber portions 4 projecting from one side thereof and a hub member portion 2 out of a sheet metal or coiled sheet metal material a press working step b to form bolt holes on the lug member portions 7 and projections 9 on the opposite side thereof by extrusion process a forming step c to bend each root portion of a pair of fork member portions to bring them to a fixed height from the hub member portion 2 a primary bending step d to form the hub member portion 2 to a cylindrical shape a secondary bending step f to project the lug member por tions 7 in parallel to each other from said cylindrically shaped hub member portion 2 soon after completion of the primary bending step d and a press reforming step g to straighten the configuration of thus formed product after the secondary bending step.
