## Description
PROCESS FOR PREPARING POLYOLEFINS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a new process for preparing polyolefins. More particularly, it is concerned with a process for preparing polyolefins not only capable of remarkably increasing the polymer yield per solid and that per transition metal, thereby dispensing with the step of removing catalyst remaining in the resultant polymer, at the same time enhancing the bulk density of the resultant polymer and diminishing the proportion of fine particles thereof, but also having good particle properties such as, for example, a large average particle diameter. In this technical field, many methods have heretofore been known which employ a catalyst comprising an inorganic magnesium solid as carrier such as magnesium halide, magnesium oxide or magnesium hydroxide and a transition metal compound supported thereon such as a titanium compound or a vanadium compound. In these known methods, however, the resultant polymers generally have a low bulk density, a relatively small average particle diameter and a wide particle size distribution and hence a large proportion of fine particles. Therefore, improvement has strongly been demanded from the standpoint of productivity and polymer handling.Moreover, in molding these polymers there arise problems such as dusting and loweriny of the molding efficiency, and therefore the foregoing increase of bulk density and decrease of the proportion of fine particles have been strongly demanded. Besides, further improvements are considered necessary in order to apply those polymers to processing machines directly in a powdered state without going through a pelletizing step.Demand for such a direct processing method has recently been increasing. The present inventors have previously proposed a novel catalyst component free of the above mentioned drawbacks in U.S. Patent No.4,396,534. This catalyst can afford a polymer having a high bulk density and a large average particle diameter, but it has been considered necessary to make further improvements in order to apply the resultant powdered polymer to a processing machine directly without going through a pelletizing step.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is the object of the present invention to provide a polymer free of the above mentioned drawbacks and having a high bulk density, a large average particle diameter, a narrow particle size distribution, an extremely reduced proportion of fine particles and a good fluidity. The present invention resides in a process for homopolymerizing oleo in or copolymerizing olefines in the presence of a catalyst comprising a solid catalyst component and an organometallic compound, said solid catalyst component being a product obtained by intercon tacting the following components i to iv i a silicon oxide and or an aluminum oxide, ii a reaction product obtained by the reaction of a magnesium halide and a compound represented by the general formula Me OR nX n wherein Me is an element of Groups i IV in the Periodic Table, z is the valence of the element Me, n is Ocn n X is a halogen atom and each R is a hydrocarbon radical having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, iii a halogenated silicon compound, and iv a titanium compound and or a vanadium compound. By using the process of the present invention there can be obtained in high activity a polyolefin having a large average particle diameter, a narrow particle size distribution, a reduced proportion of fine particles and a good fluidity. Besides, the bulk density of the polyolefin is high. This high bulk density, coupled with good fluidity, is very advantageous to the polymerizing operation. Further, tiie polyolefin even in a powdered statc, not to mention pellets, can be subjected to molding, and there are few molding troubles. Thus, it is possible to prepare polyolefins in an extremely advantageous manner. The use of the catalyst of the present invention is further advantageous in that the molecular weight distribution of the resultant polyolefin can be changed in a wide range as desired by changing catalyst preparation conditions. The catalyst of the present invention is preferably used especially for copolymerizing ethylene and one or more other Oc olefins, thereby a crystalline ethylene copolymer having a very low density about 0.87 to 0.92 g cm3 is easily obtainable.DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The silicon oxide used in the present invention may be silica or a double oxide of silicon and at least one other metal of Groups I VIII in the Periodic Table.

If oleo in polymerization is performed using a catalyst comprising the combination of the solid component thus obtained and an organometallic compound, there can be obtained a polyolefin having a large average particle diameter and a good fluidity as compared with the case where a solid component prepared according to another method is used. As examples of the organometallic compound used in the present invention, mention may be made of organometallic compounds of metals of Groups I IV in the Periodic Table which are known as one component of Ziegler type catalysts. Particularly, organoaluminum compounds and organozinc compounds are preferred.Concrete examples are organoaluminum compounds of the general formulae, R3Al, R2AlX, RIslX2, R2AlOR, Ral OR X and R3A12X3, wherein the Rs,which may be the same or different, are each an alkyl or aryl group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms and X is a halogen atom, and organozinc compounds of the general formula R2Zn wherein the Rs, which may be the same or different, are each an alkyl group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, such as triethylaluminum, triisopropylaluminum, triisobutylaluminum, tri sec butylaluminum, tri tert butylaluminum, trihexylaluminum, trioctylaluminum, diethylaluminum chloride, diisopropylaluminum chloride, diethylaluminum ethoxide, ethylaluminum sesquichloride, diethylzinc, and mixtures thereof.The amount of the organometallic compound used is not specially limited, but usually it is in the range of 0.1 to l,000 moles per mole of the titanium compound and or vanadium compound.

Then, 100 ml. of tetrahydrofuran was added and reaction was allowed to take place at 600C for 2 hours, followed by drying at 1200C under reduced pressure to remove tetrahydrofuran.Then, 2.0 ml. of titanium tetrachloride was added and reaction was allowed to take place at 1300C for 2 hours, thereafter 4 ml. of silicon tetrachloride was added and reaction was allowed to proceed at 600C for 2 hours to give a solid catalyst component contain ing 45 mg. of titanium per gram thereof. b Vapor Phase Polymerization A stainless steel autoclave was used as a vapor phase polymerization apparatus, and a loop was formed using a blower, a flow controller and a dry cyclone.The temperature of the autoclave was adjusted by passing warm water through the jacket around the autoclave. Into the autoclave adjusted to 600C were fed the above solid catalyst component and triethylaluminum at rates of 250 mg hr and 50 mmol hr, respectively.Further, butene l, ethylene and hydrogen gases were fed while adjusting the butene 1 ethylene ratio mole ratio in the vapor phase in the autoclave to 0.50 and the hydrogen pressure to 10 of the total pressure, and polymerization was conducted while circulating the intra system gases by the blower to afford a powdered ethylene copolymer having a bulk density of 0.48, anMI of 1.1, a density of 0.9005, an average particle diameter of 940Fun, free of particles not larger than 177mum, and having a good fluidity. Catalytic activity was 132,000g.copolymer g.Ti and thus very high. After a continuous run for 100 hours, the autoclave was opened and its interior was inspected. As a result, the interior was found to be clean with no polymer adhesion to the inner wall and stirrer, and there was no polymer agglomeration. Example 7 a Preparation of Solid Catalyst Component 10 g. of a commercially available anhydrous magnesium chloride and 2.4 g. of magnesium diethoxide were placed in a stainless steel pot having an internal volume of 4,00 ml. and containing 25 stainless steel balls each about 12.7mm 1 2 inch in diameter, and ball milled at room temperature for 16 hours in a nitrogen atmosphere to obtain a reaction product. A three necked flask equipped with a stirrer and a reflux condenser was purged with nitrogen and then charged with 5 g. of the above reaction product and 5 g. of SiO2 num 952, a product of Fuji Davison which had been calcined at 6000C. Then, 100 ml. of tetrahydrofuran was added and reaction was allowed to take place at 600C for 2 hours, followed by drying at 1200C under reduced pressure to remove tetrahydrofuran.Then, 0.5 ml. of titanium tetrachloride was added and reaction was allowed to take place at 1100C for 2 hours, thereafter 3 ml. of silicon tetrachloride was added and reaction was allowed to proceed at 600C for 2 hours, followed by further addition of 1.1 ml.of titanium tetrachloride and reaction at 1400C for 2 hours to afford a solid catalyst component containing 40 mg. of titanium per gram thereof. b Vapor Phase Polymerization A stainless steel autoclave was used as a vapor phase polymerization apparatus, and a loop was formed using a blower, a flow controller and a dry cyclone.The temperature of the autoclave was adjusted by passing warm water through the jacket around the autoclave. Into the autoclave adjusted to 600C were fed the above solid catalyst component and triethylaluminum at rates of 250 mg hr and 50 mmol hr, respectively. Further, propylene, ethylene and hydrogen were fed while adjusting the propylene ethylene ratio mole ratio in the vapor phase in the autoclave to 0.50 and the hydrogen pressure to 10 of the total pressure, and polymerization was conducted while circulating the intra system gases by the blower to afford a powdered ethylene copolymer having a bulk density of 0.47, anMI of 1.8, a density of 0.9091, an average particle diameter of 900pm, free of particles not larger than 177cm, and having a good fluidity. Catalytic activity was 120,000g.copolymer g.Ti and thus very high. After a continuous run for 100 hours, the autoclave was opened and its interior was inspected. As a result, the interior was found to be clean with no polymer adhesion to the inner wall and stirrer.
