These compounds are summarized in Table II. Those compounds shown in Table II that are not shown by specific preparatory example have been synthesized in accordance with one of the examples manifested below. EXAMPLE 7 2 2 Hydroxyethyl 4 cyano 5,6 4 chlorophenyl 3 2H pyridazinone If the neeessary benzil starting material is not commercially avail able, it may be prepared from the desired benzoin which in turn can be synthesized from the corresponding aldehyde and potassium cyanide. The benzil is caused to react with the cyanoacetohydrazide in DMF to give the benzilmono acetohydrazide. The latter compound is reacted with 8 sodium hydroxide to give the corresponding diphenylpyridazinone sodium salt. This salt can then be reacted with hydrochloric acid to give the corresponding NH compound. EMI29.1 This starting material is then reacted with the requisite ester to form 2 2 hydroxyethyl 4 cyano 5,6 di 4 chlorophenyl 3 2H pyridazinone,EMI29.2 EXAMPLE 8 2 2 Hydroxyethyl 4 cyano 5,6 diphenyl 3 2H pyridazinoneStep 1 17.7 grams 0.065 mole of the product of Example 1 was dissolved in 60 mls of dry dimethylformamide along with 0.25 grams of potassium hydroxide and 7.5 grams 0.085 mole of ethylene carbonate.

There was isolated 4.5 grams 71 yield of a crude product which when recrystallized from benzene gave 4 grams 63 yield of a solid which melted at 198 1990 C. The other method used to synthesize these compounds was to react the sodium salt of the desired pyridazinone with the appropriate chloro alcohol in dry dimethylformam ide. EXAMPLE 9 2 3 Hydroxypropyl 4 cyano 5 ,6 diphenyl 3 2 Hpyridazinone 5.0 grams 0.017 mole of the product of Example 6 was reacted with 1.70 grams 0.017 m of 3 chloropropanol in 60 mls of dry dimethylformamide and the solution was heated to 1l00 C for 3 hours. The sodium chloride was filtered off and the solvent was distilled at reduced pressure.

EXAMPLE 86 2 Methylpropionic acid, 345 cyantl,6 dihydro 6 oxo 3,4 diphenylpyridazin 1 yl methyl ester 13.7 grams 0.05 mole of the product of Example 1 was reacted with 5.6 grams 0.050 mole of methyl methacrylate in 100 mls of tetrahydrofuran containing 0.25 grams of sodium hydride. This mixture was heated to reflux for 46 hours, cooled and the solvent distilled at reduced pressure. The residual oil was taken up in ethyl acetate, washed with a sodium chloride solution, separated and dried over sodium sulfate. The excess solvent was distilled at reduced pressure to give 16.7 grams 89.3 of a crude product.This material was recrystallized from 95 ethyl alcohol to give 5.6 grams 30 of a solid melting at 92 94 C. The infrared spectrum showed the CN band at 4.5 11, and two carbonyl, one at 5.8 p, the other at 6.1 . EXAMPLE 87Pentanoic acid, 2 5 cyano 1,6 dihydro 6 oxo 3,4 diphenylpyridazin 1 yl ethyl ester Example 87 is performed in accordance with that procedure set forth in Example 30. EXAMPLE 88 l Pvridazinecarboxylic acid, 5 cyano 1,6 dihydro 6 oxo 3,4 diphenyl methyl esterEMI52.1 1.24 grams of 5606 sodium hydride in xylene was charged to a 500 ml 3 necked flask fitted with a stirrer, thermometer, dropping funnel and a condenser with a sodium sulfate drying tube. To this flask was also added 150 mls of dry tetrahydrofuran and the mixture stirred at room temperature for one half hour. 7.0 grams 0.0256 mole of the product of Example 1 in 50 mls of THF were added drop wise into this solution, and the mixture stirred for one hour at room temperature. 2.4 grams 0.0256 mole methyl chloroformate was added in one portion to the solution and the mixture stirred at room temperature for 3 hours.The solvent was distilled at reduced pressure and the residual solid was taken up in ethyl acetate, washed with water, separated and the organic layer dried over Na2SO4. The solvent was distilled at reduced pressure and the crude product recrystallized from absolute ethyl alcohol to give 2.6 grams 30.6 yield of the desired product. EXAMPLE 89 2 Heptanoic Acid, 2 5 cyano l, 6 dihydro 6 oxo 3 ,4 diphenylpyridazin l y1 Example 89 is performed in accordance with that procedure set forth in Example 31.

This mixture was heated on a hot water bath for one hour. The solvent was removed at reduced pressure by employing a rotovap and the residual liquid poured into excess hydrochloric acid and the precipitant yellow solid was filtered, washed with water and air dried. This solid was recrystallized from absolute ethyl alcohol to give 1.5 grams of a white solid melting at 162 166e C.

The resultant formulations contain 1040 ppm of test compound, 50 percent, by volume, of acetone and 0.05 percent, by volume, of surfactant. Appropriate lower concentrations are obtained by diluting this formulation with surfactant acetone solution so that the concentration of adjuvants is maintained at the original levels. Seeds of three broadleaf, three grassy weed species and three crop species are planted in the soil contained in 10 x 8 x 3 inch fiber pans filled with 2.0 inches of pasteurized soil Kingsville sandy loam . The broadleaf species are pigweed Amaranthus retroflexus L. , velvet leaf Abutilon theophrasti Medic. and mustard Brassica kaber DC. Wheeler the grasses are red millet Panicum milliaceum L. , green foxtail Setaria viridis L, Beauv. and barnyard grass Echinochloa crusCalli L Beauv. , and the crops are cotton Gossvpium hirsutum L. Stoneville 213 , soybean glycine max L. Merr. 1Lancert and corn Zea mays L. Pioneer 3518 F14 . The pans ate then sprayed so that the soil surface is uniformly covered with dilutions of the stock formulation providing dosage rates of the test compounds corresponding to 8, 4, 2, 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.12, 0.06, etc., kg hectare. Two weeks after treatment, percent control plant kill at each dosage rate is estimated. The postemergent herbicide tests are carried out in the same manner described above, except that the herbicide formulations are applied to the foliage of the seedling plants.

Plant Growth Regulant Activity The compounds of the invention were also evaluated relative to plant growth regulant activity against three plant species in a petri dish test. The test is divided into a primary test where 500 yg and 100 ug chemical per petri dish 100 x 25 mm, disposable are tested simultaneously and a secondary test where 50 g to 0.1 jig chemical per petri dish are tested simultaneously. Compounds which pass the primary test are further evaluated in the secondary test. A special petri dish test may also be run to evaluate particular test compounds, in which case the primary tests and secondary tests are conducted simultaneously. According to the test procedure, three plant species are planted in a petri dish which has been treated with the test substance. The three species are as follows 1 a mixture of approximately 50 percent light sensitive and 50 percent light insensitive lettuce Lactuca sativa L. 1Grand Rapids 2 soft red winter wheat tTriticum aestivum L. Aestivicum Group Abeq and 3 pasturetype perennial ryegrass Lolium perenne L. Linn . Wheat and perennial ryegrass seeds are surfaeedterilized with 1 percent sodium hypochlorite for 10 minutes and 5 minutes, respectively. Each test compound is formulated in acetone and aliquots of the test formulation are placed on three layers of sterilized filter papers Whatman No. 1, 8.26 cm diameter in each petri dish. As soon as the acetone evaporates, 7 ml of deionized water are added into each petri dish with an appropriate automatic dispenser. Then, 5 to 8 wheat seeds, 10 to 15 perennial ryegrass seeds and 10 to 15 lettuce seeds are placed on the filter paper of each petri dish. Dishes are then covered and seeds are germinated for 3 days at 20 C at a relative humidity of 6596 in the dark.

To illustrate the efficacy and broad spectrum of the plant growth regulant effects demonstrated by the compounds of the present invention, tests on specific plants to achieve specific plant growth regulant effects were conducted, The procedures and results of the various tests are described below. Height Growth Regulation of Cotton Plants Various compounds of title present invention were evaluated for the purpose of producing a shorter, more compact cotton plant by chemical treatment. The advantages to attaining plants of this stature are ease of mechanical harvesting increased pesticide, light and air penetration onto a more open canopy decreased lodging increased tolerance to high levels of nitrogen fertilization due to decreased rank growth. Four Delta Pine 61 cotton plants per 5 x 5 fiber pot were grown in standard pasteurized greenhouse soil under greenhouse conditions. Plants were thinned to 2 per pot approximately 2 weeks after planting and fertilized every 2 weeks thereafter. Test solutions were either applied into the soil as a drench or sprayed onto the plant foliage one month after planting. At this time, cotton plants were in the 1 2 true leaf stage. Treatment volume was 5 mls which is equivalent to a 500 gal A field rate when based on pot area. In the ease of foliar spray treatments, which were applied with a cone type nozzle at 12 psi, treatment volume was sufficient to wet all foliage without runoff. During the foliar spray treatments, a plexiglass shield covered the soil. Foliar treated plants were bottom watered subsequent to treatment to prevent chemical runoff. Test solutions were prepared by dissolving 24 mg of chemical or acid equivalent, in the case of salt formulations, in 17.5 mls of acetone and diluting to 50 mls with water. Five mBs 480 ppm of this solution per pot was calculated to be equivalent to a 2 kg ha rate when based on pot area. Appropriate dilutions were made with a 35 6 acetone solution to attain 1,1 2,1 4 and 1 8 kg ha rates,One half ml of 0.5 Triton X 155 Triton X 155 and Triton X 114, as appearing herein, are alkylaryl polyether alcohol surfactants obtainable from Rohm dc HaasCompany was added to each 5 mls of test solution.Control plants were either foliar sprayed or soil drenched with 3596 acetone and .0596 Triton X l55. All treatments were replicated twice. Plant height was evaluated by measuring the distance from the soil surface to the plant apex at 0 and 3 weeks after treatment for foliar sprayed cotton, and at 0 and 5 weeks after treatment for soil treated cotton The compounds tested, application rates and results are summarized in Tables XV XVII below. The data in these tables are expressed as the percent increase in height of treated plants as compared to control plants.

Regrowth is undesirable because it decreases mechanical harvesting effieiency, lowers fiber quality by adding a green stain to cotton fibers and or providing moisture which can cause fiber deterioration during the preginning stage. Mature cotton plants 2 per 5 x 7 fiber pot were sprayed with a 2 lb a.i. A rate of Mobay DEF 6 EC S,S,S Tributyl phosphorotrithioate defoliant,Emulsifiable containing 6 pounds active ingredient per gallon using a carbon dioxide back pack sprayer at 20 psi and a 2E nozzle attachment. Test solutions were prepared by dissolving an appropriate amount of weighed chemical in 6.25 mls of acetone and diluting to 25 mls with water, One ml of 0.5 Triton X 155 was added to each 25 mls of test solution. Test rates were based on a field plant area basis 1 plant per sq. ft. such that 2 kg ha was calculated to be equivalent to 37 mg per 2 plants. Test solutions were applied into the soil as a drench just prior to defoliation.Control plants were soil drenched with 25 mls of a 2596 acetone solution containing .02 Triton X 155. All treatments were replicated twice. Eight weeks after treatment regrowth was excised from all plants and weighed. The following table illustrates the results obtained.

Commercially grown chrysanthemums 5 plants per 6 inch diameter pot were purchased and subsequently grown in a growth room under artificial light. Terminal buds were removed by pinching and the plants sprayed with test solutions when new lateral shoots had grown to approximately 2 inches long.Test solutions were prepared by dissolving 18 mg of chemical in 50 mls of acetone and diluting to 100 mls with water. Ten mls 180 ppm of this solution per pot was calculated to be equivalent to 1 kg ha when based on pot area.Appropriate dilutions were made with a 50 acetone solution to attain 0.5 and 0.25 kg ha rates. One half ml of 0.5 Triton X 155 was added to each 10 mls of test solution. A Rest, a commercial standard by Eli Lily was prepared by diluting 6.8 mls of the product to 10 mls with a 50 acetone to attain a 1 kg ha rate. Appropriate dilutions were made with a 50 acetone solution to attain 0.5 and 0.25 kg ha rates. Test solutions were sprayed onto plants with a cone type nozzle air gun at 15 20 psi. All treatments were replicated twice. Control plants were sprayed with 10 mls of 50 acetone. Plant height was evaluated 8 weeks after treatment by measuring the distance between the soil level and the top of the plants. Morphological changes of treated plants were observed as early as 2 to 3 weeks after chemical treatment. A reduction in plant height and enhancement of green leaf color in treated plants as compared to control plants was observed. The compounds of the invention tested, application rates and the results are summarized in Table XXI below.

Chlamydomonas reinhardi wt. were grown in synchromonous culture using a basal salt medium supplemented with acetate at pH 7.2. Cells grown to approximately 2 x 106 per ml were diluted to 2.5 x 105 cells per ml with algal growth media. Ten mls of algal culture was dispensed into 25 mlErlenmeyer flasks, Test solutions were prepared by solubilizing a weighed amount of test compound in 10 mls of dimethylsulfoxide DMSO to yield a 10 21he concentration. Appropriate dilutions were made with DMSO to attain decreasing chemical concentrations. A 0.1 ml aliquot of test solution was added to each flask. Control flasks received 0.1 ml of DMSO. Flasks were plugged with cotton and all procedures were performed under sterile conditions. All treatments were replicated twice.Algal cultures were allowed to incubate in the presence of the chemical for 2.5 days in a water bath shaker at 250 C under a 12 hr. light 12 hr, dark cycle. At the end of the incubation period, the algal growth was terminated by adding 0.5 mls of 50 w v gluteraldehydeXto each test flask. The number of algal cells per ml of culture in treated vs. control flasks was determined by replicate counting with a hemacytometer.

Soybean plants, especially indeterminate types of soybeans, produce unnecessary vegetative growth during the reproductive growth stage of development. The unnecessary vegetative growth includes terminal bud growth and branching during the reproductive growth stages. This growth does not contribute to the yield, but reduces the yield of soybean. By inhibiting such unnecessary vegetative growth, more photosynthates and nutrients can be translocated to yield components such as the pod, thus improving the harvest index of the soybean. Such growth inhibition can also improve water economy of soybean plants and prevent senescence during reproductive stages, leading to a yield increase. Beeson soybean was grown in greenhouse and sprayed with various formulations of selected compounds of the present invention at the V2 stage,Fehr et al., stages of Soybean Development, Special Report 80, CooperativeExtension Service, Iowa State Univ., Ames, Iowa 1979 , of soybean development.Three to four weeks later, increases in height and other morphological changes were recorded. Percent height inhibition was calculated by the formula height inhibition HC HT HC X 100 where HC is an increase in average height of untreated control plants andA HT is an increase in average height of treated soybean plants. The results of this test are summarized in Table XXIII to follow. In another experiment, greenhouse grown Beeson soybean plants at V3 stage of development were sprayed with various formulations of compounds of the invention to evaluate changes in the harvest index. Harvest index. was calculated by the formula Harvest index Total pod dry weight per treatment Total aerial dry weight per treatment The results of this experiment are set out in Table XXIV below.

Such topping, however, breaks apical dominance of the plants.The immediate plant response to this procedure is the growth of axillary buds, called suckers, which have been suppressed by the shoot apex. These suckers can be removed by hand after they grow out 2 4 inches or their growth can be suppressed by chemical inhibitors. Due to high labor costs, use of chemical sucker control agents has become the procedure of choice in most parts of tobacco growing areas in this country. Diphenylpyridazinones of the present invention have demonstrated high sucker control activity in greenhouse tests. The compounds of ExampleNos. 30, 31, 124, 64, 120, 113 and 67 were selected, on the basis of the results of the primary plant growth regulant screen, to treat greenhouse grown burley or flue cured tobacco plants. The final formulation of each compound contained 0.05 to 0.2 Triton X 114 or 0.025 Triton X 155. Commercial varieties of burley or fluecured tobacco were grown in a greenhouse at a final size of 1 4 to 1 2 of the field grown plants. Five to 20 ml of test formulations were sprayed on the center of each topped plant or drenched into soil of each pot containing a topped plant at button, early flower or late flower stage. Control of the top 5 suckers were evaluated 21 to 42 days after treatment and control was calculated by the formula control TNS TR TNS TR 100 2 TNS x where TNS is the fresh weight of suckers of the topped check and TR is the fresh weight of suckers of the treated plants. The top 5 suckers have the greatest potential to regrow after topping of flower bud or flowers. The activity of the particular diphenylpyridazinone depended on types of formulation, application volume, method of application, developmental stages of the tobacco plant when a treatment was made, kinds and concentration of additives in the final formulation, treatment period and type of tobacco . The results for the selected compounds and the test parameters are summarized in Tables XXV and XXVI that follow.

Greenhouse Screening of Selected Diphenylpyridazinones for Tobacco Sucker Control Activity Flue cured tobacco plants were grown in the greenhouse until maturity. Two plants were topped at the button stage a tobacco developmental stage showing flower bud formation and grown for 6 8 days until the top most leaf span reached 6 8 inches and the top most sucker growth reached 1 3 inches,The plants at this stage are very similar to field grown plants in the early flower stage. If the plants at the button stage are not topped but grown further in the greenhouse, they will reach the early flower stage in 6 8 days. These plants are referred to as early topped early flower stage plants. Another two plants at the button stage of tobacco development were topped before chemical application. The selected pyridazinone compounds were formulated as a 6 EC emulsifiable concentrate . One early topped early flower stage plant and one button stage plant were sprayed with each compound at 1.5 mg or 3 mg per plant, except the compound of Example 38 sprayed at 3 mg or 6 mg per plant . Each compound to be tested was formulated into a 10 ml emulsified solution with a constant surfactant concentration for both rates of application. The test formulations were sparyed with a Hudson Hydragun on the center of each plant. The nozzle of the Hydragun was adjusted to generate a coarse spray. Sucker control was evaluated 5 weeks after treatment. Suckers from the top 5 nodes were counted and fresh weights of the sucker from the control topped check and the treated were determined. Also malformation of top 3 leaves of plants sprayed at the button stage was evaluated as follows Rating Number Degree of Malformation 0 None 1 Very slight 2 Slight 3 Moderate 4 Severe 5 Very severe sucker control was calculated as follows TNS TR gTNS TRy control x 100 2 TNS This formula defined on page 113.

Both labor and fuel requirements can be saved significantly by chemical grass retardation. The compounds employed in this invention show novel compositions in that none of the structures disclosed in prior art act as turfgrass retardants. Compounds that exhibit good turfgrass retardant activity from the primary screen the petri dish test were subject to a secondary pan test. Six to 10 week old turfgrasses a Kentucky bluegrass and a creeping fine fescue were cut to 2 em and treated with test formulations. A test formulation consisted of 50 acetone in water, active ingredient, and 0.025 Triton X 155. The test formulation was sprayed on leaves or soil drenched at 460 gal A carrier volume. Inhibition of height growth and phytotoxicity were evaluated 4 weeks after treatment. Percent height inhibition was calculated by the formula 96 height inhihition HC HT AHC x 100 where A HC is an increase in average height of a check turfgrass and A HT is an increase in average height of a treated turfgrass. Retardant activity and also phytotoxicity will depend on type of formulation, application volume, method of application, kinds and concentration of additives in the final formulation, treatment period, type of turfgrasses and various other factors known to those skilled in the art. The compounds tested, including a commercial standard Embark, registered trademark of 3M Company , the test species, application rates and results are summarized in Table XXVII below.

As plant growth regulants, these agents may act to chemically prune woody ornamental species. With an enhancement of foliar uptake, these pyridazinones may effectively control the growth of brush in rightof way applications. Testing was performed to provide information concerning the effects of selected diphenylpyridazinones on woody perennial growth. A tree and a shrub species were selected along with two diphenylpyridazinone acids for greehouse experimental models. Thirty, seven to nine foot tall hybrid poplars and thirty red twig dogwoods Cornus sericea were obtained for this test. The poplars, stored barerooted over winter, were repotted in a soil potting blend mixture in 1l inch plastic pots. Each tree was trimmed to a six foot height where no buds had yet broken. Likewise, the fresh field dug dogwoods were potted and trimmed back to a 24 inch branch length. One tablespoon of Peter s slow release fertilizer Osmocote was added to each pot. Type plants were watered for ten minutes every two hours using an aerial sprinkler system. After one month in the greenhouse, selected plants were treated with either the compound of Example 31 or the compound of Example 64 by application as soil drenches. Treatment solutions of 200 ml were prepared using 10 W W flowable concentrates. Chemical treatments at 8, 2 or 0.4 lb A were based on a pot area of 1.4x10 5 acres. Following the treatments, the plants were placed outside the greenhouses. The treatments applied to the different species and number of each species is set out in Table XXXII which follows TABLE XXXII Compound Test Species Example No. Rate Poplars Dogwoods 31 8 4 4 2 4 4 0.4 3 4 64 8 4 4 TABLE XXXII cont. Compound Test SpeciesExample No. Rate Poplars Dogwoods 2 4 4 0.4 3 4Control 5 6. Chemical treatments were reapplied a month later to ensure thorough chemical exposure. Four months following the initial treatment, growth of the individual poplars was measured. For the poplars, total branch length, total branch dry weight and total number of branches were measured. Since the growth measurement of the dogwoods was more complex, an estimate of the total shrub volume was taken. The maximum width in perpendicular directions in the same plane was measured along with the height above the crown 19 weeks post treatment. The results for this testing are set out in Table XXXIII and Table XXXIV that follow.

Similar to the concept for tobacco sucker control, control of the sugar beet flower bud can increase the size of the sugar beet root and the sugar content in the root. Also by controlling flower and seed head formation, control of weed beets, which is a severe problem in current sugar beet production in Europe, can be accomplished during the next growing season. Other areas where the compounds of the present invention may find use are banana sucker control, to increase yield of the mother plant and to speed up growth of a daughter plant tree and hedge growth retardation and brush control for industrial areas and under powerlines growth retardation of ground covers for park, railroads, highways, fence rows, airports, ditches, industrial open areas, and the like growth retardation of cover crops in orchards, no till farmlands and soil conservation yield enhancement for such crops as a alfalfa increase in branching, b small grains reduced stature and reduced lodging, c sugarcane inhibition of flowering, d peanut inhibition of unnecessary vegetative growth, and e sunflower reduced stature and reduced lodging malesterilant or gametocyte for hybrid seed production tree sucker control chemical flower and fruit thinning stem thickening for bean sprouts, asparagas, etc. vine control for grapes inhibition of rhizomes and control of seed germination.Clearly, the biologist working in this field of technology will recognize the wide plant growth regulant utilities for these compounds. While the invention has been described and illustrated with reference to certain preferred embodiments thereof, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various changes, modifications and substitutions can be made therein without departing from the spirit of the invention. For example, application rates other than those preferred ranges set forth hereinabove may be applicable due to variations in soils and planting characteristics, etc. Moreover, the specific results observed with respect to broadleaf and grass weed control as well as crop selectivity may vary depending on the specific active compounds selected and whether same are used alone or in combination with each other, i.e., mixture, or other known agents. Also, the specific formulation and the manner of applying same, e.g., soil drench, foliar spray, etc., may affect results.Accordingly, such expected changes and variations in results are contemplated in accordance with the objects and practices of the present invention. It is intended, therefore, that the invention be limited only by the scope of the claims which follow.
