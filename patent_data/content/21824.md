# Process for production of acrylated urethanes and urethanes produced thereby.

## Abstract
There is described a process for producing radiation curable acrylated urethanes having a lower viscosity than heretofore achievable without dilution are produced by first reacting a monohydroxyfunctional acrylate with a polyisocyanate followed by the reaction of the product mixture produced with a polyol. The acrylated urethanes are useful for incorporation in radiation curable coatings.
