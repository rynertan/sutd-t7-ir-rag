# Photosensitive film unit containing zinc compound to increase dye stability.

## Abstract
A photographic film unit employing redox dye releasers contains a zinc compound, for example zinc oxide, in such a form, location and concentration that it will be diffusible in the film unit during processing, and the dye which is released from the redox dye releaser during processing will have an in creased stability to light. The zinc compounds may be incorpo rated in the photosensitive portion of the film unit in a process ing composition or in a cover sheet but not in the mordant lay er, a layer adjacent thereto or a pigmented layer.
