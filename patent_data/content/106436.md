# SOFA BED MECHANISM

## Abstract
A sofa bed mechanism comprising a foldable bed frame having side and end rails and a back support slat extending between the side rails across the width of the bed frame at a position corresponding to the upper back area of a user in a sleeping position. The back support slat is bowed upwardly in its natural state and moved downwardly under load to yieldable resist the load and exert an outwardly directed force on the side rails. The slat has a top surface of substantial width so that it adds firmness to the bed without interfering with sleeper comfort. The mechanism also in cludes legs of semicircular cross section supporting the bed frame on the floor.
