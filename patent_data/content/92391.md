As the inert solvent, halogenated hydrocarbons for example, chloroform, methylene chloride, etc. amides for example, dimethylformamide, etc. , substituted or unsubstituted aromatic hydrocarbons for example, benzene, toluene, etc. , lower alcohols for example, methanol, ethanol, etc. , etc. can be used alone or in combination. The reaction is carried out in a range of 0 to 1500C, preferably between room temperature and the boiling point of the used solvent. The reaction is usually completed in 1 48 hours. When Q is a carbonyl group, the resulting product can be further reduced to a Compound I whose Q is a hydroxymethylene group. The reaction can be carried out by reacting a Compound I whose Q is a carbonyl group with a complex metal hydride for example, sodium borohydride, etc. in a range of 10 to 1000C, preferably between OOC and the boiling point of a solvent used, in a lower alcohol such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, etc. The reaction is usually completed in 1 48 hours. The reaction can also be carried out by reacting the Compound ti with a complex metal hydride such as lithium aluminum hydride, etc. in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, ether, dimethoxyethane, dioxane, etc. The reaction is carried out in a range of 100C to room temperature, and is usually completed in 1 12 hours. 2 In case of X being other thanEMI13.1 The Compound I can be obtained by reacting a piperidine derivative represented by the general formula III EMI13.2 wherein X1 represents X other thanEMI14.1 and Y has the same meaning as defined above with a compound represented by the general formula IV EMI14.2 wherein A, m, Q and R have the same meanings as defined above, and Z is an eliminable group in an inert solvent, and, if necessary, further reducing the reaction product, and, if necessary, leaving the protective group. Z of Compound IV includes a halogen atom for example, chlorine, bromine and iodine , an alkylsulfonyloxy group for example, methanesulfonyloxy, etc. , an arylsulfonyloxy group for example, benzenesulfonyloxy, paratoluenesulfonyloxy, etc. , etc. As the inert solvent, ketones for example, acetone, etc. , halogenated hydrocarbons for example, chloroform, methylene chloride, etc. , amides for example, dimethylformamide, etc. , substituted or unsubstituted aromatic hydrocarbons for example, benzene, toluene, chlorobenzene, etc. , lower alcohols for example, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, etc. , etc. can be used alone or in combination. The reaction is carried out in a range of 0 to 1500C, preferably between room temperature and the boiling point of a solvent used, depending on the reactivity of group Z to be exchanged. The reaction is usually completed in 1 48 hours. Generally, the presence of a base can make the reaction proceed more smoothly. The base to be used in the reaction includes a lower alcoholate for example, sodium methylate, sodium ethylate, etc. , an alkali hydroxide for example, sodium hydroxide, etc. , an alkali carbonate for example, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, etc. , a tertiary amine for example, triethylamine, pyridine, etc. , etc. An appropriate amount of the base to be used in the reaction is about 1.0 1.2 times the equivalent ofCompound III when an acid addition salt of Compound III is used, it goes without saying that additional base enough to neutralize the acid is required . Use of a reaction promoter such as potassium iodide, etc. is preferable for smooth progress of the reaction.
