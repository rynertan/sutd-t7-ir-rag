## Description
PENICILLANIC ACID DERIVATIVES One of the most well known and widely used classes of antibacterial agents is the class known as the ss lactam antibiotics. These confounds are characterized in that they have a nucleus consisting of a 2 azetidinone ss lactam ring fused to either a thiazolidine or a dihydro 1,3 thiazine ring. When the nucleus contains a thiazolidine ring, the compounds are usually referred to generically as penicillins, whereas when the nucleus contains a dihydrothiazine ring, the compounds are referred to as cephalosporins.Typical examples of penicillins which are commonly used in clinical practice are benzylpenicillin penicillin G , phenoxymethylpenicillin penicillin V , ampicillin and carbenicillin typical examples of common cephalosporins are cephalothin, cephalexin and cefazolin. However, despite the wide use and wide acceptance of the ss lactam antibiotics as valuable chemotherapeutic agents, they suffer from the major drawback that certain members are not active against.certain microorganists. It is thought that in many instances this resistance of a particular microorsanism to a given ss lactam antibiotic results because the microorganism produces a S lactamse. The latter substances are enzymes which cleave the ss lactam ring of penicillins and cephalosporins to give products which are devoid of antibacterial activity.However, certain substances have the ability to inhibit ss lactamases, and when a B lactamase inhibitor is used in combination with a penicillin or cephalosporin it can increase or enhance the antibacterial effectiveness of the penicillin or cephalosporin against certain microorganisms. It is considered that there is an enhancement of antibacterial effectiveness when the antibacterial activity of a combination of a a lacta ase inhibiting substance and a ss lactam antibiotic is significantly greater than the sum of the antibacterial activi,les of the individual components. This invention relates to 6 aminopenicillanic acid 1,1 dioxide, a new ss lactamase inhibitor, esters thereof readily hydrolyzable in vivo, and salts of these compounds and also derivatives of 6 aminopeni cillanic acid 1,l dioxide having a carboxy protecting group. Said latter compounds are useful as chemical intermediates for 6 aminopenicillanic acid l,l dioxice and esters thereof. In Volume 76 January to June 1972 of the ChemicalSubstances Index of Chemical Abstracts, there appears an entry under the heading 4 thia l aza bicyclo I3.2.01 heptane 2 carboxylic acid, 6 amino 3,3 dimethyl 7 oxo, 4,4 dioxide. This latter name is, of course, an alternate name for 6 aminopenicillanic acid 1,1dioxide. The Index refers to Abstract No. 153735n, which is an abstract of West German OffenlegungsschriftNo. 2,140,119. However, Abstract No. 153735n makes no reference to any penicillin 1,1 dioxides. WestGerman Offenlegungsschrift No. 2,140,119 discloses a new process for oxidizing penicillin derivatives e.g.6 aminopenicillanic acid to the corresponding 1oxide. It is stated that the latter process produces penicillin l oxides e.g. 6 aminopenicillanic acid 1oxide uncontaminated by the corresponding 1,1 dioxides e.g. 6 aminopenicillanic acid l,l dioxide . No other mention of penicillin l,l dioxides is made in WestGerman Offenlegungsschrift 2,140,119. t,l Dioxides of benzylpenicillin, phenoxymethylpenicillin and certain esters thereof have been disclosed in United States Patents 3,197,466 and 3,536,698, and in an article by Guddal et al., Tetrahedron Letters,No. 9, 381 1962 . Harrison et al., in the Journal of the Chemical Society London , Perkin I, 1772 1976 , have disclosed a variety of penicillin 1,1 dioxides, including methyl phthaliinidopenicillanate 1,l dioxide and methyl 6,6 dibrcinopenicillanate l,l dioxide. United States patent No. 3,344,581 discloses 6 aminopeni cillanic acid l oxide. Chaikovskaya et al., Antibiotiki, 13, 155 1968 , disclose that benzyl penicillin 1,1dioxide was found to be inactive when tested for 5 lactamase inhibiting activity against E. coli. According to the invention there are provided novel compounds of the formulaEMI3.1 the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts and the pharmaceutically acceptable base salts thereof, wherein R1 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, ester forming residues readily hydrolyzable in vivo, and conventional penicillin carboxy protecting groups. The term ester forming residues readily hydrolyzable in vivo is here intended to refer to non toxic ester residues which are rapidly cleaved in mammalian blood or tissue, to release the corresponding free acid i.e..the compound of formula I, wherein R1 is hydrogen .Typical examples of such readily hydrolyzable ester forming residues which can be used for R1 are alkanoyloxymethyl having from 3 to 7 carbon atoms, l alkanoyloxy ethyl having from 4 to 8 carbon atoms, l methyl l alkanoyloxy ethyl having from 5 to 9 carbon atoms, alkoxycarbonyloxymethyl having from 3 to 6 carbon atoms, l alkoxycarSonyloxy ethyl having from 4 to 7 carbon atoms1 1 methyl 1 alkoxycarbonyloxy ethyl having from 5 to 8 carbon atoms, 3 phthalidyl, 4crotonolactonyl and y butyrolacton 4 yl. The compounds of the formula I, wherein R1 is hydrogen or an ester forming residue readily hydrolyzable in vivo, are useful for enhancing the antibacterial activity of 9 lactam antibiotics. Said compounds of the formula I, wherein R1is a carboxy protecting group, are useful as chemical intermediates to the compound of the formula I, wherein R1 is hydrogen, or an ester forming residue readily hydrolyzable in vivo.A typical carboxy protecting group is benzyl. Thus, the ss ctamase inhibitors of this invention are the compounds of the formulaEMI4.1 and the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts and the pharmaceutically acceptable base salts thereof, wherein R3 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and ester forming residues readily hydrolyzable in vivo. This invention relates to the novel compounds of forinulas I and IA, and throughout this specification they are referred to as derivatives of penicillanic acid, which is represented by the structural formulaEMI5.1 In formula II, broken line attachment of a substituent to the bicyclic nucleus indicates that the substituent is below the plane of the bicyclic nucleus. Such z substituent is said to be in the a configuration. Conversely, solid line attackment of a substituent to the bicyclic nucleus indicates that the substituent is attached above the plane of the nucleus. This latter configuration is referred to as the 5 configuration. 4 Crotonolactonyl and gamma butyrolacton 4 yl refer to structures III and IV, respectively. The wavy lines are intended to denote each of the two epimers and mixtures thereof.EMI5.2 As indicated hereinbefore, the compounds of this invention are the compounds of formula I, and the pha aceutically acceptable acid addition and base salts thereof. When R1 is an ester forming residue readi .y hydrolyzable in vivo in a compound of fcrmulaI, it is a grouping which is notionally derived from an alcohol of the formula Rl OE, such that the moiety COORI in such a compound of formula I represents an ester grouping. Moreover, RÚ is of such a nature that the grouping COOR1 is readily cleaved in vivo to liberate a free carboxy group COOH .That is to say,R1 is a group of the type that when a compound of formula I, wherein R1 is an ester forming residue readily hydrolyzed in vivo, is exposed to mammalian blood or tissue, the compound of formula I, wherein R1 is hydrogen, is readily produced. Such groups for R1 are well known in the penicillin art. In most instances they improve the absorption characteristics of the penicillin compound. Additionally, R1 should be of such a nature that it imparts pharmaceutically acceptable properties to a compound of formula I, and it liberates pharmaceutically acceptable fragments when cleaved in vivo. As indicated above, ester forming residues readily hydrolyzable in vivo are well known and are readily identified by those skilled in the penicillin art.See, for example, West German Offenlegungsschrift No.2,517,316. Typical examples of such groups for RÚ are 3 phthalidyl, 4 crotonolactonyl, garuma bufrrolacton 4 yl and groups of the formulaEMI6.1 wherein R4 and R5 are each selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and alkyl having from 1 to 2 carbon atoms, and R6 is alkyl having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. However, preferred groups for R1 are alkanoyloxymethyl having from 3 to 7 carbon atoms, l talkanoy loxy ethyl having from 4 to 8 carbon atoms, l methyl l alkanoyloxy ethyl having from 5 to 9 carbon atoms, alkoxycarbonyloxymethyl having from 3 to 6 carbon atoms, l alkox.ycarbonyloxy ethyl having from 4 to 7 carbon atoms, 1 methyl 1 alkoxycarbonyloxy ethyl having from 5 to 8 carbon atoms, 3 phthalidyl, 4crotonolactonyl and gamma butyrolacton 4 yl. Esters of 6 aminopenicillanic acid 1,1 dioxide readily hydrolyzable in vivo can also be termed bioprecursors of 6 aminopenicillanic acid 1,1 dioxide. This invention relates to compounds of the formulaI, wherein RÚ is hyrogen, an ester forming residue readily hydrolyzable in vivo or a conventional carboxy protecting group. When it is a protecting group, RÚ is any carboxy protecting group conventionally used in the penic1lin and or cephalosporin art to protect the carboxy groups at the 3 and 4 positions respectively.The identity of the carboxy protecting group is not critical and typical examples which can be used are the tetrahydropyranyl group, the benzyl group, substituted benzyl groups e.g. 4 nitrobenzyl , the benzylhydryl group, the 2,2,2 trichloroethyl group, the t butyl group and the phenacyl group. See further UnitedStates Patents 3,632,850 and 3,197,466 British PatentNo. 1,041,985, Woodward et al., Journal of the AmericanChemical Society, 88, 852 1966 Chauvette, Journal of Omani Chem s rv, 36, 1259 1971 Sheehan et al.,Journal of Organic Chemistry, 29, 2006 1964 and Cephalosporins and Penicillins, Chemistry and Biology , edited by H. E. Flynn, Academic Press, Inc., 1972. In one method according to the invention, the compound of the formula I, wherein RÚ is hydrogen is obtained simply by removal of the protecting group from a coinpound of the formula I, wherein R1 is a conventional carboxy protecting group. Naturally, the protecting group is removed in conventional manner for that specific group, although conditions must be chosen which are compatible with the S lactam ring system.Conditions which are compatible with the ss lactas ring system are well known to those skilled in the art. Particularly useful protecting groups for R are the benzyl group and substituted benzyl groups, especially 4 nitrobenzyl. Benzyl and substituted benzyl groups can be removed conveniently by catalytic hydrogenation. In this case, a solution in an inert solvent of the compound of the formula I, wherein R1 is benzyl or substituted benzyl, is stirred or shaken under an atmosphere of hydrogen, or hydrogen mixed with an inert diluent such as nitrogen or argon, in the presence of a catalytic mount of a hydrogenation catalyst. Convenient solvents for this hydrogenation are lower alkanols, such as methanol ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran and dioxan low molecular weight esters, such as ethyl acetate and butyl acetate water and mixtures of these solvents. However, it is usual to choose conditions under which the starting material is soluble. The hydrogenation is usually carried out at a temperature in the range from about 0 to about 600C. and at a pressure in the range from about 1 to about 100 kg. cm. . The catalysts used in this hydrogenation reaction are the type of agents known in the art for this kind of transformation, and typical examples are the noble metals, such as nickel, palladium, platinum and rhodium. The catalyst is usually present in an amount from about 0.01 to about 2.5 weight percent, and preferably from about 0.1 to about 1.0 weight percent, based on the compound of formula I. It is often convenient to suspend the catalyst on an inert support a particularly convenient catalyst is palladium suspended on an inert support such as carbon.Additionally it is usual to buffer the reaction mixture in order to operate at a pH in the range fro out 4 to 9, and preferably from 6 to 8.Borate and phosphate buffers are commonly used. The reaction typically takes about one hour, after which the compound of the formula I, wherein R1 is hydrogen, is recovered simply by filtration followed by removal of tile solvent in vacuo. A further particularly useful protecting group forR1 is the 2,2,2 trichloroethyl group. This group can be removed by treating the compound of the formula I, wherein R1 is 2, 2, 2 trichloroethyl, with zinc dust in acetic acid, formic acid or a phosphate buffer, according to well known methods. See further Woodward et al., Journal of the American Chemical Society, 88, 852 1966 Pike et al., Journal of Organic Chemistry, 34, 3552 1969 Just et al., Svnthesis, 457 1976 . The compound of the formula I, wherein 21 is hydrogen can be purified, if desired, by methods wellknown in the art, e.g. recrystallization or chromatography. The compounds of the formula I wherein R is hydrogen or a carboxy protecting group can be prepared from a com pound of the formula EMI10.1 wherein R7 is a conventional carboxy protecting group and Rê is a conventional amino protecting group, by a process which simply involves removal of said amino protecting group.A variety of groups known in the art for protecing amino functions can be used for Rê major requirements for R2 are that i the group will reduce the nucleophilicity of te nitrogen atoms to which it is attached to such an extent that it is substantially unaffected during oxidation of the sulfide group in the thiazolidine ring to a sulk one grouping and ii the protecing group R2 can be removed under conditions which do not adversely affect the ss lactam ring of the compound of the formula I.Typical examples of amino protecting groups for Rê are benzyloxycarbonyl and 2, 2, 2 trichloroethoxycarbonyl. Removal of the protecting group R2 from a compound of the formula VII, wherein R7 is a conventional carboxy protecting group and R2 is benzyloxycarbonyl, is readily accomplished by a conventional hydrogenation reaction. This can be carried out by the method described earlier for removal of the benzyl or substituted benzyl group from a compound of the formula I, wherein RÚ is benzyl or substituted benzyl. Moreover, removal of the trichloroethoxycarbonyl group from a compound of the formula VII, wherein R7 is a conventional carboxy protecting group and R2 is trichioroethoxycar bonyl, can be accomplished by zinc dust reduction.The conditions discussed earlier cr removal of the trichloroethyl group from the compound of the formulaI, wherein R1 is trichloroethyl, can be used for this purpose. As will be recognized by one skilled in the art, in the case wherein 7 is benzyl or substituted benzyl, and R2 is benzyloxycarbonyl, it is possible to removeR7 and R2 effectively in a single step by hydrogenation, to produce the compound of the formula I, wherein R1 is hydrogen. Similarly, R7 as trichloroethyl and R2 as trichloroethoxycarbonyl can be removed effectively in a single step from a compound of formula VII by zinc dust reduction, to give the compound of formulaI, wherein R1 is hydrogen. The compound of formula VII, wherein R7 is a conventional carboxy protecting group and R2 is a conventional amino protecting group, can be prepared from the corresponding compound of the formulaEMI11.1 by oxidation. A wide variety of oxidants known in the art for the oxidation of sulfides to sulfones can be used for this process. However, particularly convenient reagents are alkali metal permanganates, e.g. potassium permanganate, and organic peracids, e.g. 3 chloroperbenzoic acid. The latter named reagent is a particularly convenient oxidant. When a compound of the formula VIII, wherein R and R2 are as previously defined, is oxidized to the corresponding compound of the formula VII, using 3chloroperbenzoic acid, the reaction is usually carried out by treating the compound of the formula VIII wit from about 2 to 4 molar equivalents, and preferably about 2.2 equivalents, of the oxidant in a reaction inert organic solvent. Typical solvents are chlorinated hydrocarbons, such as dichloromethane, chloroform and 1,2 dichloroethane and ethers such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and 1,2 dimethoxyethane. The reaction is normally carried out at a temperature of from about 0 to about 800C., and preferably at about 250C. At about 250C. reaction times of about 2 to about 16 hours are commonly used. The product is normally isolated by removal of the solvent by evaporation in vacuo. The product can be purified by conventional methods, well known in the art. The compounds of the formula VIII are either known compounds, which are prepared by published procedures, or they are analogs of know compounds, which are prepared by analogous procedures. In general the compounds of the formula VIII are prepared simply by attaching the protecting groups R7 and R2 to the well known intermediate 6 aminopenicillanic acid. The groups R7 and Rê can be attached by the known method for the particular group, taking due account of the stability of the 5 lactam ring system. In many instances the order of attachment of R7 and R2 is not critical. The compounds of formula I, wherein RÚ is hydrogen, can be prepared by removal of the protecting group R2 from a. compound of the formulaEMI13.1 wherein 22 is a conventional amino protecting group.The group Rê is removed in the same manner as that described earlier for removal of R2 from a compound of fornula VII. The compounds of. formula IX, wherein R2 is a conventional amino protecting group, can be prepared by oxidation o a compound of the formulaEMI13.2 wherein Rê is a conventional amino protecting group.This oxidation is carried out in exactly the same manner as described previously for oxidation of a compound of the formula VIII to VII. The compounds of formula X are prepared from 6aminopenicillanic acid by attachment of the protecting group thereto. The protecting group is attached in conventional manner, having due regard for the lability of the 5 lactam ring system. 1. Compounds of the formula I, wherein R1 is an ester forming residue readily hydrolyzable in vivo, can be prepared from a compound of the formula X, wherein 2. Rê is a conventional amino protecting group, by a three step sequence which comprises a . esterifica tion of said compound of formula X, to give a compound of formulaEMI14.1 wherein R2 is as defined previously and 28 is an ester forming residue readily hydrolyzed in vivo b oxica tion of the compound of formula XI, to give a compound of formulaEMI14.2 wherein R2 and R8 are as defined previously and c removal of the protecting group R2. Step a of the above sequence is carried out in a manner which is determined by the precise structure of the ester forming residue, but an appropriate method will be readily selected by one skilled in the art. In the case wherein R1 is selected from the group consisting of 3 phthalidyl, 4 crotonolactonyl, gamma butyrolacton 4 yl and groups of the formula V and VI, whereinR4, R5 and R6 are as defined previously, a convenient method comprises alkylation of the compound of formulaX with a 3 phthalidyl halide, a 4 crotonolactonyl halide, a gamma butyrolacton 4 yl halide or a compound of the formula EMI15.1 wherein Q is halo, and R4, R5 and R6 are as previously defined. The terns halide and halo are intended to mean derivatives of chlorine, bromine and iodine.The reaction is conveniently carried out by dissolving a salt of said compound of formula X in a suitable, polar, organic solvent, such as N,N dimethylformamide, and then adding about one molar equivalent of the halide. wrnen the reaction has proceeded essentially to completion, the product is isolated by standard tech niques. jt is often sufficient simply to dilute the reaction medium with an excess of water, and then extract te product into a water immiscible organic solvent and then reccver same by solvent evaporation.Salts of the compound of formula X which are commonly used are alkali metal salts, such as sodium and potassium salt, and tertiary amine salts, such as triethylamine, ethyldiisopropylamine, N ethylpiperidine, N, N dimethylaniline and N nethyl norpholine salts. The reaction is run at a temperature in the range from about 0 to 1000C., and usually at about 250C. The length of time needed to reach completion varies according to a variety of factors, such as the concentration of the reactants.and the reactivity of the reagents.Thus, when considering the halo compound, the iodide reacts faster than the bromide, which in turn reacts faster than the chloride. In fact, it is sometimes advantageous, when utilizing a chloro compound, to add up to one molar equivalent of an alkali metal iodide.This has the effect of speeding up the reaction. With full regard for the foregoing factors, reaction times of from about 1 to about 24 hours are commonly used. Step Q of the above sequence involves oxidation of compound XI to compound XII. This reaction is carried out in the same manner as that described earlier for the oxidation of compound VIII to compound VII. Step c of the above sequence involves removal of the protecting group Rê. Said protecting group Rê is removed in conventional manner. For example, benzyl and substituted benzyl groups can be removed by catalytic hydrogenation, using the method described earlier for removal of such groups from a compound of formula I, wherein R1 is benzyl or substituted benzyl, to gave the compound of formula I, wherein R is hydrogen. The compound o formula I, wherein R1 is hydrogen, is acidic and will form salts with basic agents. Such salts are considered to be within the scope of this invention. These salts can be prepared by standard techniques, such as contacting the acidic and basic components, usually in a stoichiometric ratio, in an aqueous, non aqueous or partially aqueous medium, as appropriate. They are then recovered by filtration, by precipitation with a non solvent followed by filtration, by evaporation of the solvent, or in the case of aqueous solutions, by lyophilization, as appropriate. Basic agents which are suitably employed in salt formation belong to both the organic and inorganic types, and they include a nonia, organic amines, alkali metal hydroxides, carbonates, bicaronates, hydrides and alkoxides, as well as alkaline earth metal hydroxides, carbonates, hydrides and alkoxides. Representative examples of such bases are primary amines, such as n propylamine, n butylamine, cyclohexylamine, benzylamine, and octylamine secondary amines, such as diethylamine, morpholine, pyrrolidine and piperidine tertiary amines, such as triethylamine, N ethylpiperidine, N methylmor pholine and 1,5 diazabicyclo 4.3.Olnon 5 ene hydroxides, such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide and barium hydroxide alkoxides, such as sodium ethoxide and potassium ethoxide hydrides, such as calcium hydride and sodium hydride carbonates, such as potassium carbonate and sodium carbonate bicarbonates, such as sodium Dica sonate and potassium bicarbonate and alkali metal salts of long chain fatty acids, such as sodium 2 ethylhexanoate. Preferred base salts of the compound of the formula I, wherein RÚ is hydrogen, are sodium, potassium and triethylamine salts. The compounds of formula I ere basic, and they will torm acid addition salts. Such salts are within the scope of this invention, and they are prepared by standard techniques for penam compounds. Examples of acid addition salts which are particularly valuable are hydrochloride, hydrobromide, phosphate, perchlorate, citrate, tartrate, pamoate, glutarate and 4 toluene sulfate salts. As indicated hereinbefore, the compounds of the formula IA, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, are inhibitors of microbial ss lactamases, and they increase the antibacterial effectiveness of 3lactam antibiotics penicillins and cephalosporins against many microorganisms which produce a ss lactamase.The manner in which the compound of the formula IA, wherein R3 is hydrogen, increases the effectiveness of a B lactsm antibiotic in vitro can be appreciated by reference to experiments in which the MIC MinimumInhibitory Concentration of a given antibiotic alone, and said compound of the formula IA alone, are measured.These MIC s are then compared with the MIC values obtained with a combination of the given antibiotic and said compound of the formula IA. When the antibacterial potency of the combination is significantly greater than would have been predicted from the potencies of the individual compounds, this is considered to constitute enhancement of activity. The MIC values of combinations are measured using the method described by Barry and Sabbath in Manual of Clinical Microbiology , edited by Lenette, Spaulding and Truant, 2nd edition, 1974,American Society for Microbiology. For example 6 aminopenicillanic acid l,1 dioxide, esters thereof readily hydrolyzable in vivo and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof enhance the antibacterial effectiveness of penicillin G against anerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroides spp., and the effectiveness of ampicillin against resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus. The ability of the compounds of the formula IA, wherein R3 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and ester forming residues readily hydrolyzable in vivo, and salts thereof, to enhance the effectiveness of a ss lactam antibiotic against certain ss lactamaseproducing bacteria makes them valuable for co administration wit certain ss lactam antibiotics in the treatment of bacterial infections in mammals, particularly man. In the treatment of a bacterial infection, a compound of formula IA can be comingled with the ss lactam antibiotic, and the two agents thereby administered simultaneously.Alternatively, a compound of formula IA can be administered as a separate agent during a course of treatment with a 5 lactan antibiotic. When using a compound of fo...ula U, or salt thereof, to enhance the antibacterial activity of a R lactam antibiotic, the compound of formula U, or salt thereof, can be administered alone, or preferably, in formulation with standard pharmaceutical carriers and diluents.The compound of formula IA, wherein R3 is hydrogen, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, can be administered parenterally the compounds of formula IA, wherein R3 is an ester forming residue readily hydrolyzable in vivo, and the pharaceutically acceptable salts thereof, can be administered both orally and parenterally. Parenteral administration includes intramuscular, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal and intravenous administration. When a compound of formula IA is used in the presence o a carrier or diluent, said carrier or diluent is chosen, on the basis of the intended mode of administration. For example, when consIdering the oral mcde of administration, the compound of formula IA, or salt thereof, can be used in the form of tablets, capsules, lozenges, troches, powders, syrups, elixirs, aqueous solutions and sessions, and the like, in accordance with standard pharmaceutical practice. The proportional ratio of active ingredients to carrier will naturally depend on the chemical nature, solubility, stability and potency of the active ingredients, as well as the dosage contemplated.However, these pharma ceutical compositions will likely contain from about 5 to about 80 of carrier. In the case of tablets for oral use, carriers which are commonly used include lactose, sodium citrate and salts of phosphoric acid. Various disintegrants such as starch, and iubric2ting agents, such as magnesium stearate, sodium laurel sulfate and talc, are commonly used in tablets. For oral administration in capsule form, useful diluents are lactose and high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. When aqueous suspensions are required for oral use, the active ingredients are combined with emulsifying and suspending agents. If desired, certain sweetening and or flavoring agents can be added. For parenteral administration, which includes intramuscular, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous and intravenous use, sterile solutions of the active ingredients are usually prepared, d the pH or the solutions are suitably adjusted and buffered.For intravenous use, the total concentration of solutes should be controlled to render the preparation isotonic. Although the prescribing physician will ultimately decide the dosage to be used in a human subject, the ratio of the daily dosages of a compound of formula IA, or salt thereof, and the ss lactam antibiotic will normally be in the range from about 1 3 to 3 1. Additionally, the daily oral dosage of each component will normally he in the range from about 10 to about 200 mg.per kilogram of body weight and te daily parenteral dosage of each component will normally be about 10 to about 400 mg. per kilogram of body weight. These figures are illustrative only, however, and in some cases it may be necessary to use dosages outside these limits. The following es ples are provided solely for the purpose of further illustration. Infrared IR spectra were measured as potassium romide discs KBr discs , and diagnostic absorption bands are reported in wave numbers cm 1 . Nuclear magnetic resonance spectra NMR were measured at 60 MHz for solutions in deutero chloroform CDCl3 or deuterium oxide D20 , and peak positions are expressed in parts per million pom downfield from tetramethylsilane or sodium 2,2 dimethyl 2 silapentane 5 sulfonate. The following abbreviations for peak shapes are used s, singlet d, doublet t, triplet q, quartet m, multiplet. EXAMPLE 1 Sodium 6 Aminopenicillanate 1,1 Dioxide To a slurry of 4.7 g. of 5 percent palladium oncarbon in 10 ml. of water was added a solution of 4.7 g. of benzyl 6 benzyloxycarbonylaminopenicillanate 1,1dioxide in 50 ml. of ethyl acetate. The mixture was hydrogenated at a pressure from s8 44 p.s.i.g. for 15 minutes. To the mixture was then added 2.5 ml. of 2N sodium hydroxide, and te resulting mixture was filtered. The aqueous phase was removed, its pH was adjusted to 5.3, and then it was freeze dried.This afforded 1.19 g. of the title prcduct. The IR spectrum K3r disc showed absorptions at 1810, 1610, 1320 and 1120 cm 1. The NMR spectrum in D2O showed absorptions at 5.01 d, 1E, J 4Hz , 4.87 d, 1H, J 4Hz , 4.24 s, 1H , 1.55 s, 3E and 1.42 s, 3H ppm. EXAMPLE 2 6 Aminopenicillanic Acid 1,1 Dioxide To a solution of 2.79 g. 0.01 mole of sodium 6aminopenicillanate l,l dioxide in 30 ml. of water is added 5 ml. of 2N hydrochloric acid. The mixture is concentrated to small volume in vacuo, and then the solid which precipitates is collected by filtraton.This affords the title zwitterion. EXAMPLE 3 Benzyl 6 Aminopenicillanate 1,1 Dioxide To 1.23 g. 2.4 mmole of benzyl 6 2,2,2 trichloroethoxycarbonylamino penicillante 1,1 dioxide in 20 ml.of tetrahydroduran is added 2.0 g. cf zinc dust followed by 4.0 ml. of LM potassium hydrogen phosphate, with vigorous stirring. Stirring is continued for 1 hour, and then a further 2.0 g. of zinc dust and 4.0 ml. of 1M potassium dihydrogen phosphate are added.
