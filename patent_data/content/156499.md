# Master cylinder reservoir.

## Abstract
A master cylinder reservoir 1 primarily for use in a trac tor hydraulic braking system, has a pair of separate com partments 4, 5 , each adapted for connection to a respective one of a plurality of pressure cylinders 2, 3 . The compart ments are interconnected by a flexible connector means shown as a convoluted tube 8 , and the reservoir is advan tageously made in a single piece by blow moulding. The arrangement enables variations in the relative positions of the cylinders to vary whilst enabling the reservoir to be read ily mounted thereon by way of spigots 6,7 engaging bores in the cylinders. The reservoir also has a flanged rigid tubular connection component 10 moulded into it during the res ervoir moulding operation, the material of the reservoir closely surrounding opposed surfaces of a flange 12 of the component 10 to resist longitudinal withdrawal of the com ponent.
