FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention is directed to processes for the production of proteins related to any of the pseudorabies virus PRV envelope glycoproteins and to processes and compositions for making and using novel DNA sequences, plasmids and microorganisms both eucaryotic and procaryotic to produce such proteins0 The present invention comprehends expression of these glycoproteins. The present invention utilizes recombinant DNA techniques to insert a DNA sequence coding for pseudorabies protein or a portion thereof, into a DNA vector, such as viral DNA, plasmid DNA or bacteriophage DNA, such that the vector is capable of replicating and directing expression of the envelope protein gene in a bacterial host or other single cell system. The resulting recombinant DNA molecule is introduced into host cells to thereby enable production of the PRV protein, or a portion or molecular variant thereof, by the host cells. Recombinant DNA technology may also be used to express a gene in a stably transformed cell line. The protein produced is then isolated, purified and used as an immunogen in a vaccine against infection of pigs by pseudorabies virus. The present invention also provides a method of producing pseudorabies virus antigens of general importance in veterinary medicine and in microbiological research. This includes use of the pseudorabies virus proteins produced by the present invention as highly reproducible standard antigens for ultrasensitive assays such as radio immunoassays. These antigens may also be used as diagnostic tools for detection of antibodies to pseudorabies virus in biological samples. Finally, the pseudorabies proteins produced by the present invention will be invaluable in elucidating the mechanisms of infection and pathogenesis of the various isolates of pseudorabies virus. The structural PRV glycoproteins have been tentatively classified by Hampl et al. 1984, J. Virol. 52 583 590 in which the major structural glycoproteins are identified byRoman numerals gI gV . To be consistent with the literature, glycoproteins referred to in this patent application are identified according to the Hampl nomenclature. 2. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 2.1. RECOMBINANT DNA TECHNOLOGY AND GENE EXPRESSION Recombinant DNA technology involves insertion of specific DNA sequences into a DNA vehicle vector to form a recombinant DNA molecule which is capable of replication in a host cell. Generally, the inserted DNA sequence is foreign to the recipient DNA vehicle, i.e., the inserted DNA sequence and the DNA vector are derived from organisms which do not exchange genetic information in nature, or the inserted DNA sequence may be wholly or partially synthetically made. In recent years several general methods have been developed which enable construction of recombinant DNA molecules. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,237,224 to Cohen and Boyer describes production of such recombinant plasmids using restriction enzymes and methods known as ligation.These recombinant plasmids are then introduced and replicated in unicellular organisms by means of transformation. Because of the general applicability of the techniques described therein, U.S. Pat.No. 4,237,224 is hereby incorporated by reference into the present specification. Another method for introducing recombinant DNA molecules into unicellular organisms is described by Collins and Hohn in U.S. Pat. No. 4,304,863 which is also incorporated herein by reference. This method utilizes a packaging transduction system with bacteriophage vectors cosmids . Recombinant genes may also be introduced into viruses, such as vaccina virus. Recombinant viruses can be generated by transfection of plasmids into cells infected with virus. Regardless of the method used for construction, the recombinant DNA molecule must be compatible with the host cell, i.e., capable of autonomous replication in the host cell. The recombinant DNA molecule or virus i. e., a vaccinia virus recombinant should also have a marker function which allows the selection of the desired recombinant DNA molecule s or virus es . In addition, if all of the proper replication, transcription and translation signals are correctly arranged on the recombinant DNA molecule, the foreign gene will be properly expressed in the transformed bacterial cells, as is the case with bacterial expression plasmids, or ih permissive cell lines infected with a recombinant virus. As is characteristic of all viruses which infect eucaryotic cells, Pseudorabies virus PRV requires a eucaryotic host cell system in which to replicate its genome, express its viral genes and generate its progeny. The signals and control elements for DNA replication, gene expression and virus assembly in eucaryotes differ from those 69 procaryotes. This is of critical importance when attempts are made to express in procaryotic host cells a gene which is naturally expressed only in eucaryotic cells. These different genetic signals and processing events control many levels of gene expression for instance, DNA transcription and messenger RNA translation. Transcription of DNA is dependent upon the presence of a promoter which is a DNA sequence that directs the binding of RNA polymerase and thereby promotes transcription. The DNA sequences of eucaryotic promoters differ fran those of procaryotic promoters. Furthermore, eucaryotic promoters and accompanying genetic signals may not be recognized in or may not function in a procaryotic system. Similarly, translation of messenger RNA mRNA in procaryotes depends upon the presence of the proper procaryotic signals which differ from those of eucaryotes.Efficient translation of mRNA in procaryotes requires a ribosome binding site called the Shine Dalgarno SD sequence on the mRNA. This sequence is a short nucleotide sequence of mRNA that is located before the start codon U G which encodes the amino terminal methionine of the protein. The SD sequences are complementary to the 3 end of the 16S rRNA ribosomal RNA and probably promote binding of mRNA to ribosomes by duplexing with the rRNA to allow correct positioning of the ribosome. For a review on maximizing gene expression, see Roberts and Lauer, 1979, Methods inEnzymology 68 473. In addition to these different control elements, many eucaryotic genes contain intervening sequences introns which are not present in the mature mRNA or the corresponding double stranded complementary DNA cDNA coding for the gene for review see Chambon, 1981, Sci. Amer. 244 60 71 .During mRNA processing in eucaryotes, these introns are spliced out of the mRNA prior to translation for reviews seeCrick, 1979, Science 204 264, Sharp, 1981, Cell 23 643 . Expression of eucaryotic genes clÏned in procaryotic hosts requires that the coding sequence of the gene of interest be available in a form uninterrupted by intervening sequences. Therefore, when eucaryotic genetic sequences which contain intervening sequences are to be cloned in a procaryotic host, isolation of mRNA as the source of the genetic information offers an advantage over the isolation of the relevant DNA sequence. Accordingly, the isolated mRNA is transcribed into single stranded complementary DNA cDNA copies which are then enzymatically processed into double stranded DNA molecules which can be inserted into cloning vectors. Many other factors complicate the expression of eucaryotic genes in procaryotes even after the proper signals are inserted and appropriately positioned. A clear understanding of the nature of these factors and the mechanisms by which they operate is presently lacking.However, one such factor is the presence of an active proteolytic system in E. coli and other bacteria. This protein degrading system appears to selectively destroy abnormal or foreign proteins such as eucaryotic proteins.A tremendous utility, therefore, would be afforded by the development of a means to protect eucaryotic proteins expressed in bacteria from proteolytic degradation. One strategy is to construct hybrid genes in which the eucaryotic sequence is ligated 4nrphase i.e., in the correct reading frame with a procaryotic gene. Expression of this hybrid gene results in a fusion protein product a protein that is a hybrid of procaryotic and foreign or eucaryotic amino acid sequences . Construction of hybrid genes was the approach used in the molecular cloning of genes encoding a number of eucaryotic proteins, such as somatostatin Itakura et al., 1977, Science 198 1056 , rat pre proinsulin Villa Komaroff et al., 1978, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U.S.A. 75 3727 , growth hormone Seeburg et al., Nature 276 795 , and ovalbumin like protein Mercereau Puijalon et al., 1978, Nature 275 505 . Additionally, procaryotic promoters have been ligated to such fusion gene sequences in the case of ovalbumin Fraser et al., 1978, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U.S.A. 75 5936 and ss globin Guarente et al., 1980, Cell 20 543 . The Guarente et al. system involves inserting the lac promoter, including theSD sequence, at varying distances in front of the ATG of the fusion gene. Although the molecular cloning and expression of several eucaryotic genes has been accomplished, this has not heretofore been done for any pseudorabies virus genes encoding structural glycoproteins. Nor is the state of the art such that expression of foreign or eucaryotic genes in procaryotic host cells may be routinely performed. Successful expression of a cloned gene requires efficient transcription of DNA, translation of the mRNA and in some instances post translational modification of the protein. Expression vectors have been used to express genes in a suitable host and to increase protein production. The cloned gene should be placed next to a strong promoter which is controllable so that transcription can be turned on when necessary. Cells can be grown to a high density and then the promoter can be induced to increase the number of transcripts. These, if efficiently translated will result in high yields of protein. This is an especially valuable system if the foreign protein is deleterious to the host cell. 2.1.1. ORI MUTATIONS Most plasmid cloning vectors commonly used in E. coli are derivatives of ColEl type replicons for additional information see Oka et al., 1979, Mol. Gen. Genet. 172 151159 . The ColEl plasmids are stably maintained in E. coli strains as monomeric molecules with a copy number of about 15 20 copies per chromosome. Various levels of expression of human and animal health care protein products of foreign genes inserted into these plasmids have been obtained.However, very high expression levels should be obtained in order for the system to become economically feasible to produce foreign protein products. One way to obtain large amounts of a given gene product is to clone a gene on a plasmid which has a very high copy number within the bacterial cell. In theory, by increasing the number of copies of a particular gene, mRNA levels should also increase which should lead to increased production of protein. Muesing et al. 1981, Cell 24 235 242 have isolated the recessive copy number mutant, Cop plasmid pOP1g6 from ColEl. This plasmid, which exists at levels of about 200 300 copies per chromosome, is characterized by a mutation on the plasmid genome about 400 b.p. from the origin of replication of a single base pair alteration a G C to T A transversion in the copA gene. The copA sequence is thought to code for a small RNA transcript RNAl which may act as a negative modulator of the ColEl DNA replication machinery.It is believed that a disruption of the secondary structure of the RNA by the mutation is responsible for the loss of its negative controlling effects. Uhlin et al. 1983, Gene 22 255 265 have reported a series of plasmids which are double cop copy number mutants of the plasmid R1. These plasmids are unique in that they carry a temperature sensitive mutation which allows the plasmid to be present in moderate numbers per cell at temperature below 300C. Above 350C, all control of plasmid replication is apparently lost and the number of plasmid copies per cell increases continuously to nearly 2000. Cell growth and protein synthesis continue at normal rates for 2 3 hours at the higher temperature. During this period, products of genes present on the plasmid may be overproduced.Inhibition of cell growth occurs after 2 3 hours and the cell loses viability. Eventually, plasmid DNA may account for as much as 75 of the total DNA present in the cell. 2.1.2. VACCINIA VIRUS AS AN EXPRESSION VECTOR Vaccinia virus may be used as a cloning and expression vector. The virus contains a linear double stranded DNA genome of approximately 187 kb pairs and replicates within the cytoplasm of infected cells. These viruses contain a complete transcriptional enzyme system including capping, methylating and polyadenylating enzymes within the virus core which are necessary for virus infectivity. Vaccinia virus transcriptional regulatory sequences promoters allow for initiation of transcription by vaccinia RNA polymerase but not by eucaryotic RNA polymerase. Expression of foreign DNA in recombinant viruses requires the fusion of vaccinia promoters to protein coding sequences of the foreign gene. Plasmid vectors, also called insertion vectors have been constructed to insert the chimeric gene into vaccina virus.One type of insertion vector is composed of 1 a vaccinia virus promoter including the transcriptional initiation site 2 several unique restriction endonuclease cloning sites downstream from the transcriptional start site for insertion of foreign DNA fragments 3 nonessential vaccinia virus DNA such as theTK gene flanking the promoter and cloning sites which direct insertion of the chimeric gene into the homologous nonessential region of then virus genome and. 4 a bacterial origin of replication and antibiotic resistance marker for replication and selection in E. coli. Examples of such vectors are described by MacKett 1984, J. Virol. 49 857864 . Recombinant viruses are produced by transfection of recombinant bacterial insertion plasmids containing the foreign gene into cells infected with vaccinia virus.Homologous recombination takes place within the infected cells and results in the insertion of the foreign gene into the viral genome. Recombinant viruses can be screened for and subsequently isolated using immunological techniques, DNA pelaguerlybridizatiotsr or genetic selection. These vaGclnia recombinants retain their essential functions and infectivity and can be constructed to accomodate approximately 35 kb of foreign DNA. Foreign gene expression can be detected by enzymatic or immunological assays immunoprecipitation, radioimmunoassay, or immunoblotting . Additionally, naturally occurring membrane glycoproteins produced from recombinant vaccinia infected cells are glycosylated and may be transported to the cell surface. High expression levels can be obtained by using strong promoters or cloning multiple copies of a single gene. 2.2. VACCINES There are at least four basic approaches for the control and therapy of viral infections 1 vaccines that elicit an active immune response 2 chemotherapeutic agents that inhibit viral replication 3 agents that induce the synthesis of interferon and 4 administration of antibodies for passive immunity. All four can be used to prevent infection, but are more effective when applied early in infection. Vaccination, or active immunization is usually ineffective after infection has begun. Viruses are small and compared to cells, relatively simple in structure. Viruses contain a central core of nucleic acid either DNA or RNA surrounded by a protein coat called a capsid. In many viruses, the capsid is surrounded by a loose membranous envelope which is similar to a cellular membrane in composition. Viral nucleic acid contains the information needed for replicating the virus genome and producing the protein components of the virion particle within infected cells. When an animal is infected by a virus, it reacts to the capsid or envelope protein as a foreign protein. The host may develop immunity, which is manifested by the formation of antibodies and lymphocytes which are capable of recognizing the viral proteins. This may result in inactivation of the virus and lysis of infected cells. Thus, conventional vaccines providing active immunity are prepared by producing large amounts of virus in cell tissue culture or in laboratory animals and then rendering the virus harmless without destroying its immunological properties. Traditionally this is accomplished either by inactivating the infectivity of the virus i.e., killing the virus, usually by treatment with various chemical agents such as formaldehyde for use in inactivated vaccines, or by selecting an avirulent or attenuated modified virus for use in live vaccines attenuated vaccines . Attenuation is obtained by adapting the virus to unusual conditions for example, to different animal hosts and cell cultures by frequent passages of large viral inocula to select mutants which have lost virulence, or by genetically modifying the virus, and thus to produce safer vaccines. A few vaccines still used in veterinary practice consist of fully virulent infectious virus injected in a site where virus multiplication is of little consequence. Attenuated virus used in live vaccines are generally excellent immunogens because the attenuated virus multiplies in the host thus eliciting long lasting immunity. Attenuated virus vaccines induce humoral antibodies directed against both virion and nonvirion proteins and also induce cellmediated immunity. The vaccines are generally stable if freeze dried, easy to administer, and because of their potency, require only one inoculation. There are, however, a number of problems encountered with the use of live vaccines, such as insufficient attenuation of the virus, genetic instability of the virus, contamination by adventitious viruses in cell cultures used to grow the vaccine virus, and, finally, the vaccine may be unstable e.g., heat labile . While the use of inactivated vaccines employing killed or inactivated virus that does not multiply avoids the difficulties encountered with the use of live vaccines, killed viruses do not multiply in the immunized animal and usually produce antibodies directed against only virion structural components. There are two major difficulties with inactivated vaccines. Firstly, it is frequently not possible to inactivate all the virus particles. Secondly there is the difficulty of producing enough virus to provide the necessary quantity of the relevant antigen.Other difficulties encountered with the use of inactivated vaccines are that the immunity achieved is brief and often requires additional immunizations, the antigenic sites may be altered by the inactivating chemical treatment, and thus be less immunogenic or may induce antibodies that are less effective at neutralizing viral infections, and these vaccines frequently do not induce satisfactory levels of secretory antibody. Subunit vaccines contain only the necessary and relevant immunogenic material, such as the capsid proteins of nonenveloped icosahedral viruses or the peplomers glycoprotein spikes of enveloped viruses. Subunit vaccines can be made by isolating the relevant subunit from highly purified viral fractions, or by synthesizing the relevant polypeptide. A major advantage of subunit vaccines is the exclusion of genetic material of viral origin and of toxic, contaminating or otherwise undesirable substances of the host or donor. However, at present, production of subunit vaccines using these methods is too expensive for widespread commercial veterinary use.Recombinant DNA technology has much to offer in the production of subunit vaccines the molecular cloning and controlled expression of viral genes which encode the relevant immunogenic portions of the virus or its proteins can produce sufficient quantities of the relevant polypeptide for use as an immunogen in a subunit vaccine. Vaccines are often administered in conjunction with various adjuvants. The adjuvants aid in attaining a more durable and higher level of immunity using smaller amounts of antigen jfewer doses than if the immunogen were.administered alone. The mechanism of adjuvant action is complex and not completely understood. However, it may involve the stimulation of phagocytosis and other activities of the reticuloendothelial system as well as a delayed release and degradation of the antigen. Examples of adjuvants include Freund s adjuvant complete or incomplete ,Adjuvant 65 containing peanut oil, mannide monooleate and aluminum monostearate , the pluronic polyol L 121, Avridine,DDA and mineral gels such as aluminum hydroxide, aluminum phosphate, or alum. Freund s adjuvant is no longer used in vaccine formulations for humans or for food animals because it contains nonmetabolizable mineral oil and is a potential carcinogen however, the mineral gels are widely used in commercial veterinary vaccines0 2.3.PSEUDORABIES Pseudorabies is an infectious, naturally occurring viral disease affecting many animal species. The disease is also known as Aujesky s disease, mad itch, and infectious bulbar paralysis. In swine the virus affects the respiratory tract and nervous and reproductive systems. The clinical disease in pigs varies with the age of the animals. The morbidity and mortality rate among young suckling pigs is close to 100 , whereas the mortality rate is usually not as high in pigs over 6 weeks of age. There has been a marked increase in the incidence of the disease in the United States, Mexico, and some Western European countries in recent years. Swine are the natural hosts of the virus and the primary source of infection for other animals. Infected swine can transmit the virus through nasal secretions, saliva, milk, placenta, and by boars during service. Swine which survive the disease develop a lasting antibody. These animals are subject to latent infections and become carriers. The infections may become reactivated spontaneously, under certain stress, corticosteroid administrations, or tissue explantation. It was originally believed that infection was the result of direct contact with pigs. However, infections in cattle and sheep indicate that these species become infected through the respiratory tract. The virus has been found in nasal mucosa, lungs and vagina of cattle. The source of infection in other wildlife badgers, racoons, skunks, rats is thought to be from feeding on infected swine carcasses. The illness in very young and weaning pigs is sudden and progresses rapidly towards death. Depression, tremors, uncoordinated movements, and convulsions may be observed before death. The main clinical features are respiratory signs. The animals develop high fevers and may cough and sneeze. Diarrhea and vomiting may also be observed0 Intense pruritus is a characteristic sign of the disease.Additionally, breeding problems with some sows and gilts may occur following an outbreak of the disease. There is no treatment for the disease once an infection has been initiated and little can be done to reverse the course of the disease after it appears. Anti PRV serum given to swine exposed to the virulent virus have limited usefulness at this time since it fails to prevent viral replication and shedding of virulent virus, and thus these swine can spread the virus to susceptible animals and are subject to latent infections. At present every effort is made to avoid infection, although administration of a hyperimmune serum toopaglets is effective in reducing death losses during an outbreak. Pseudorabies is caused by a herpesvirus Herpetoviridae . The components of the complete virus virion are the core containing the genome, an icosohedral capsid composed of 162 capsomeres, each of which has subunits, variable amounts of globular material asymmetrically arranged around the capsid i.e., the tegument and an outer membrane or envelope that encloses the entire structure. The core is about 75 nm in diameter, the nucleocapsid is 105 110 nm and the complete enveloped virion is about 180 nm in diameter. The genome consists of a linear double stranded DNA duplex of approximately 90 x 106 daltons in size and can be divided into two covalently linked components, the L and S components. The DNA of PRV consists of a short unique sequence bounded by inverted complementary repeats and a long unique sequence.The short unique sequence inverts so that two isomeric forms of the PRV genome exist. The sequence of biochemical and physical events of the infective cycle is similar to that of many DNA viruses and typical of herpesviruses affecting mammalian species. The infective cycle requires from 15 to 19 hours and begins with attachment of the virus to the cell and ends with the cessation of viral replication and cellular lysis. Nascent virus particies are released from the cell beginning 6 to 9 hours post infection Gustaf son, 1981, Disease of Swine, 5thEdition, Eds A.D. Leman et al., Iowa State UniversityPress, Ames . 3. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Methods and compositions are provided for the cloning and expression of PRV genes or portions thereof encoding viral structural proteins in single cell host organisms.Also described are methods for culturing these novel singlecell organisms to produce the pseudorabies virus gene product and methods for purifying the gene product. The PRV related proteins produced by the recombinant DNA techniques described herein may be formulated for use as immunogens in vaccines to protect against viral infection. Alternatively, these PRVrelated proteins may be used to generate antisera which can be employed in the detection of virus for diagnostic purpose as well as being used directly to screen sera of pigs for exposure to PRV virus or previous vaccination. The isolated pseudorabies virus genes or gene fragments were inserted into bacterial plasmids and a vector to form recombinant DNA molecules which serve as biologically functional replication units. The recombinant DNA molecules were constructed so as to facilitate both the replication and expression of the PRV genetic sequences upon transformation of a suitable bacterial cell or alternatively, as with virus vectors, infection of compatible host cells. Additionally, the present invention contemplates the introduction of a pseudorabies virus gene into a eucaryotic cell line such that the gene is constitutively expressed in the transformed cell. Bacterial expression plasmids were constructed so that transformed microorganisms actively expressing the PRV genetic sequences could be identified in one step. Methods are described for the isolation, stabilization, and purification of the expressed gene products. These methods take advantage of the fact that many fusion proteins produced in bacterial cells will be resistant to degradation in the host cell. Methods are provided for the co production of both the fusion and the unfused product0 Methods are also provided for the isolation and purification of the coaggregate forming proteins. Methods are also described for isolating the expressed product and for its use in formulating a vaccine0 Finally, methods are provided for using live recombinant vaccinia virus as immunological tools and as live vaccines against infectious agents. The proteins thus produced may be used in vaccine formulations. Vaccines produced by recombinant DNA technology can address many of the problems involved in the production of conventional vaccines. First, very little virus is needed in order to isolate the relevant genetic sequences which are used in the construction of recombinantDNA molecules. The use of such recombinant molecules to transform appropriate host cells allows for the production of effective vaccines against viruses that cannot easily be grown i ieil ti ss ue culture or in laboratory animals. Second, recombinant DNA vaccines are a type of subunit vaccine, and contain, at worst, incomplete viral genetic bacterial. Third, since large scale bacterial fermentation can be used, the vaccines can be produced economically in large and used quantities. Fourth, recombinant viruses can be used as live vaccines and for the construction of polyvalent vaccines, as in the case with vaccinia virus. 4.

Because immunity toPRV is produced by humoral and cellular responses to the surface proteins of the viral envelope, a subunit vaccine may be formulated which contains only those viral surface proteins subunits responsible for evoking the immune response. All other portions of the virus can be excluded from the vaccine. The subunit vaccine formulation will efficiently protect the recipient animal against PRV infection. For instance, the PRV structural proteins or any antigenically significant portion thereof may be used in a subunit vaccine which would efficiently protect a recipient animal against infection if the recipient animal is a pregnant sow, the fetus or embryo will also be protected fromPRV infections in utero. The polypeptides and antisera produced according to the method of the present invention may also be used for diagnostic purposes. For instance, the polypeptides may be used as antigens for in vitro immunoassays to determine antisera titers in animals such in vitro assays are currently known and used by those skilled in the art.Alternatively, antisera, antibodies, or monoclonal antibodies directed against the polypeptides produced herein may be used in immunoassays for the detection of PRV which may be present in the body fluids or feces of infected animals. The recombinant bacterial plasmids, constructed as described herein, provide for host cell production of a protein which is a PRV related polypeptide, and which is stable and resistant to host cell degradation such plasmids ienable the generation of large quantities of a PRV related protein or fusion protein containing immunological and antigenic determinants of a PRV structural protein.Similarly, recombinant viruses constructed as described herein, provide for expression of foreign genes to be used in another embodiment of the present invention. Since the techniques described herein may be used to produce polypeptides related to any of the PRV structural proteins, it can readily be seen that various immunogens and vaccine formulations can be prepared. Vaccinia virus The PRV glycoprotein gene may be obtained from any strain of PRV virus. Isolation of a PRV glycoprotein gene or portion thereof involves first isolating PRV DNA, generating DNA fragments, and identifying the fragments which contain the glycoprotein gene sequences. Before identification, the PRV DNA fragments are usually ligated into cloning vectors that are used to transform the host recombinants can also be used as live vaccines against infectious agents. In the present invention, protein components of purifiedPRV virions indicated the presence of at least four glycoproteins. Because of the large size of the PRV genome approximately 150,000 base pairs and the prior lack of any data on localization of glycoprotein genes, a simple and effective strategy was utilized in the present invention to locate a PRV glycoprotein that involved use of antibodies against authentic PRV glycoproteins, cloning of random genomic PRV DNA fragments in expression vectors and Western blot analysis. The method of this invention may be divided into the following stages for the purpose of description 1 identification and isolation of the relevant PRV gene or gene fragment 2 insertion of the gene or gene fragment into a cloning expression vector to form a recombinant DNA molecule which is used to transform single cell organisms 3 identification and growth of the transformed single cell organisms which are capable of replicating and expressing the gene 4 identification and purification of the gene product 5 construction and isolation of vaccinia virus recombinants expressing the PRV gene 6 determination of the immunopotency of the gene product by assessment of its ability to elicit the production of neutralizing antibodies and 7 formulation and use of subunit vaccines. 5 IDENTIFICATION AND ISOLATION OF PRV GLYCOPROTEIN GENES cells this enables generation of multiple copies of the PRVDNA fragments so that an ample supply is available for analysis and identification procedures. The PRV DNA can be obtained either a by isolating DNA directly from virus purified from eucaryotic cells infected with the virus or b from bacteriophage or plasmids which contain portion s of the viral genome encompassing the PRV gene. In order to generate the PRV DNA fragments, the DNA may be cleaved at specific sites using restriction enzymes alternatively, one can use DNase to fragment the DNA or theDNA can be physically sheared, as, for example, by sonication. The linear DNA fragments can then be separated according to size by standard techniques, including, but not limited to, agarose and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and column chromatography. Any restriction enzyme or combination of restriction enzymes may be used to generate the PRV DNA fragment s containing the PRV glycoprotein gene sequence provided the enzymes do not destroy the immunopotency of the PRV gene protein product. For example, the antigenic site of a protein can consist of approximately 7 to 14 amino acids.Thus, a protein of the size of the PRV glycoproteins may have many discrete antigenic sites, possibly thousands considering overlapping sequences, secondary and tertiary structure considerations, and processing events such as acetylation, glycosylation or phosphorylation. Therefore, many partialPRV polypeptide gene sequences could code for an antigenic site. Consequently, many restriction enzyme combinations may be used to generate DNA fragments which, when inserted into En appropriate vector, are capable of directing in a host cell the production of PRV specific amino acid sequences comprising different antigenic determinants. Transformation of host cells with these recombinant DNA molecules incorporating the PRV DNA fragments enables the veneration of multiple copies of viral DNA which can then be analyzed to identify the fragment that contains the PRV gene sequence. Insertion of DNA restriction fragments into a cloning vector is easily accomplished when the cloning vector has complementary cohesive termini. However, if the complementary restriction sites used to fragment the PRV DNA are not present in the cloning vector, the ends of the PRVDNA or the cloning vector may be modified. Such modifications include producing blunt ends by digesting back single stranded DNA termini or by filling in single stranded termini with the appropriate enzyme s 8o that the ends can be blunt end ligated.Alternatively, any site desired may be produced by ligating nucleotide sequences linkers onto theDNA termini these ligated linkers may comprise specific chemically synthesized oligonucleotides containing restriction enzyme recognition sites. According to other methods, the cleaved vector and the PRV DNA fragment may be modified by homopolymeric tailing. For a review see Morrow, 1979, Methods in Enzymology 68 3 . Identification of the specific DNA fragment containing the PRV gene may be accomplished in a number of ways.Firstly, it is possible to sequence the viral DNA fragments Maxam and Gilbert, 1980, Methods in Enzymology 65 49 and then identify the fragment containing the PRV protein gene sequence based upon a comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence to the amino acid sequence of the PRV protein. Secondly, the fragment containing the PRV protein gene may be identified by mRNA selection. In this procedure the PRV DNA fragments are used to isolate complementary mRNA s by hybridization. Immunoprecipitation analysis of the in vitro translation products of the isolated mRNAs identifies the complementary PRV DNA fragments encoding for a particular gene product s . Thirdly, PRV specific mRNAs may be selected by adsorption of mRNA associated polysomes isolated fromPRV infected cells, to immobilized antibodies directed against PRV proteins. A radiolabeled PRV cDNA complementaryDNA can be synthesized using the selected mRNA extracted from the adsorbed polysomes as a template.The radiolabeled cDNA may then be used as a probe to localize on the PRV genome the gene encoding this particular gene product Alwine et al., Methods in Enzymology 65 499 . Fourthly, as described in the embodiment of the present invention, DNA fragments can be identified by the shotgun cloning expression procedure described herein. Finally1 cloned Herpes simplex virus HSV genes may be used as heterolgous DNA probes in aSouthern blot analysis of PRV genomic DNA to localize regions of homology. Alternatives to isolating the PRV gene include but are not limited to, chemically synthesizing the gene sequence itself provided the sequence is known or making cDNA to the mRNA which encodes the PRV gene. To accomplish this, mRNA specific for PRV is isolated from virus infected cells. By standard techniques the isolated mRNA is then converted to a cDNA copy and inserted directly into a cloning vector. Transformation of host cells with recombinant DNA molecules that incorporate the isolated gene, cDNA or synthesized DNA sequence enables generation of multiple copies of the gene. Thus, the gene may be obtained in microgram quantities by growing transformants, isolating the recombinant DNA molecules from the transformants and retrieving the inserted gene from the isolated recombinantDNA. Alternatively, microgram quantities of the PRV protein gene may be obtained from the source of the PRV gene, e.g.,PRV in infected animal cells, or bacteria or page containing the viral gene in recombinant expression plasmids. The viral or plasmid DNA may be isolated, fragmented, fractionated and sized by the same methods which may be used to locate the gene. 5.2. INSERTION OF THE PRV DNA FRAGMENTS INTO CLONING EXPRESSION VECTORS Once isolated, the PRV gene or gene fragment is inserted into an appropriate expression vector, i.e., a vector which independent of their position and orientation with respect to a nearby gene. Unlike the classic promoter elements e.g., the polymerase binding site and the Goldberg Hogness TATA box which must be located immediately 5 to the gene, enhancer sequences have a remarkable ability to function upstream from, within, or downstream from eucaryotic genes contains the necessary elements for transcription and translation of the inserted gene see Roberts and Lauer, 1979, Methods in Enzymology, 68 473 . In order to obtain efficient expression of the gene or a portion of the gene , a promoter must be present in the expression vector. RNA polymerase normally binds to the promoter and initiates transcription of a gene or a group of linked genes and regulatory elements called an operon .Promoters vary in their strength , i.e., their ability to promote transcription. For the purpose of molecular cloning it is desirable to use strong promoters in order to obtain a high level of transcription and, hence, expression of the gene. Depending upon the host cell system utilized, any one of a number of suitable promoters may be used. For instance, when cloning in E. coli, its bacteriophages, or plasmids, promoters such as the lac promoter, trp promoter, recA promoter, ribosomal RNA promoter, the Pg and PL promoters of coliphage lambda and others including but not limited to lacUV5, ompF, bla, lpp and the like, may be used to direct high levels of transcription of adjacent DNA segments.Additionally, a hybrid tRp lacUV5 tac promoter or other E.coli promoters produced by recombinant DNA or other syntheticDNA techniques may be used to provide for transcription of the inserted gene. When cloning in a eucaryotic host cell, enhancer sequences e.g., the 72 bp tandem repeat of SV40 DNA or the retroviral long terminal repeats or LTRs, etc. may be inserted to increase transcriptional efficiency. Enhancer sequences are a set of eucaryotic DNA elements that appear to increase transcriptional efficiency in a manner relatively therefore, the position of the enhancer sequence with respect to the inserted PRV gene is less critical. Specific initiation signals are also required for efficient gene transcription and translation in procaryotic cells. These transcription and translation initiation signals may vary in strength as measured by the quantity of gene specific messenger RNA and protein synthesized, respectively. The DNA expression vector, which contains a promoter, may also contain any combination of various strong transcription and or translation initiation signals.Thus, any SD ATG combination that can be utilized by host cell ribosomes may be employed such combinations include but are not limited to the SD ATG combination from the cro gene or the N gene of coliphage lambda, or from the E. coli tryptophan E, D, C, B or A genes. Additionally, any SD ATG combination produced by recombinant DNA or other synthetic techniques may be used. Any of the methods previously described for the insertion of DNA fragments into a vector may be used to ligate a promoter and other control elements into specific sites within the vector. Accordingly, PRV genetic sequences containing those regions coding for the structural glycoproteins can be ligated into an expression vector at a specific site in relation to the vector promoter and control elements so that when the recombinant DNA molecule is introduced into a host cell the PRV genetic sequence can be expressed i.e., transcribed and translated by the host cell. The recombinant DNA molecule may be introduced into appropriate host cells including but not limited to bacteria, virus, vast, mammalian cells or the like by transformation, transduction or transfection depending upon the vector host cell system .Transformants are selected based upon the expression of one or more appropriate gene markers normally present in the vector, such as ampicillin resistance or tetracycline resistance in pBR322, or thymidine kinase activity in eucaryotic host systems. Expression of such marker genes should indicate that the recombinant DNA molecule is intact and is replicating.Expression vectors may be derived from cloning vectors, which usually contain a marker function such cloning vectors may include, but are not limited to the following SV40 and adenovirus, vaccinia virus vectors, yeast vectors, bacteriophage vectors such as lambda gt WES lambda B, Charon 28, Charon 4A, lambda gt llambda BC, lambda gt l lambda B, M13mp7, M13mp8, M13mp9, or plasmid DNA vectors such as pBR322, pAC1OS, pVA5l, pACYC177, pKH47, pACYC184, pUB110, pMB9, pBR325, Col El, pSC101, pBR313, pML21, RSF2124, pCRl, RP4, pBR328 and the like. Expression of viral genes in a eucaryotic host systems may result in the production of a polypeptide that serves as a better immunogen than those produced by procaryotic transformants because the protein may be expressed in a more natural form similarly expression in eucaryotic host cell systems may be advantageous due to secondary protein modifications which occur during eucaryotic biosynthesis.Such secondary protein modifications include but are not limited to acylation, glycosylation, methylation, phosphorylation, sulfation and the like. The eucaryotic host cell might modify i.e., phosphorylate or glycosylate the clonally derived polypeptide product at sites identical to those of the natural protein. In addition, bacterial host cell strains may be chosen which inhibit the action of the promoter unless specifically induced. In this way greater than 95 of the promoterdirected transcription may be inhibited in uninduced cells.In certain operons the addition of specific inducers is necessary for efficient transcription of the inserted DNA for example, the lac operon is induced by the addition of lactose or IPTG isopropylthio B D galactoside . A variety of other operons, such as trp, pro, etc., are under different controls. The trp operon is induced when tryptophan is absent in the growth media and the PL promoter of lambda can be induced by an increase in temperature in host cells containing a temperature sensitive lambda represor, e.g., cI857. Thus, expression of the genetically engineered PRV protein may be controlled. This is important if the protein product of the cloned gene is lethal or detrimental to host cells.In such cases, transformants may be cultured under conditions such that the promoter is not induced, and when the cells reach a suitable density in the growth medium, the promoter can be induced for production of the protein. One such promoter operator system is the so called tac or trp lac promoter operator system referred to as tac Russell and Bennett, 1982, Gene 20 231 243 DeBoer, EuropeanPatent Application, 67,540 filed May 18, 1982 . This hybrid promoter is constructed by combining the 35 b.p. 35 region of the trp promoter and the 10 b.p. 10 region orPribnow box of the lac promoter the sequences of DNA which are the RNA polymerase binding site . In addition to maintaining the strong promoter characteristics of the tryptophan promoter, tac is also controlled by the lac repressor. This construction may explain the higher efficiency of expression of this hybrid promoter with respect to either one of the parental promoters. Gene expression can also be controlled at the level of translation. In non suppressor cells transformed with amber, ochre, or opal modified plasmids See Section 5.4.3. , translation of the mRNA produced from the plasmid DNA stops at the nonsense codon and only the desired protein unfused1 is expressed. In an appropiate host one that is able to suppress the nonsense codon , some of the ribosomes, read through the nonsense codon and produce fusion protein.ISince the level of suppression varies in different host cells, it is possible to regulate the ratio of unfused protein to fusion protein by choosing the appropriate suppresor host cell. The expression of genes maybe regulated in several other ways. For example, in order to improve the initiation of translation, an A T rich DNA segment may be inserted between the SDCr and the ATG initial codon for the start of translation. An oligomer which contain an A T rich sequence may be synthesized using state of the art nucleic acid chemistry. A particularly useful method is described in U.S.Patent Application Serial No. 491,099 by Kempe, et al., filedMay 5, 1983 which is incorporated herein by reference. ThisA T rich segment may be needed to destabilize the secondary structure of the mRNA within this region and thereby facilitate ribosome binding and subsequent translation along the message. In many recombinant clones studied only one translational stop codon e.g., TAG, TAA or TGA is present for termination of translation, and no transcriptional stop like sequences are found in the 3 untranslated region of the clones. Therefore a triple translational stop sequence, with all 3 nonsense codons may be inserted in phase with the reading frame of the protein. Again, this linker is synthesized using methods referred to above. This construction should then provide for efficient tetmination of translation by assuring proper translational termination with little chance of read through into the 3 non coding region of the mRNA. Recent studies have shown that the tryptophan attenuator region of the tryptophan operon provides for the efficient termination of mRNA transcription from the DNA. This extremely stable stem and loop structure is characteristically GC rich and posseses dyad symmetry, followed by an oligo T stretch at the site of termination similar to the well known features of rho independent transcription termination sites in procaryotes. By taking advantage of this system, a sequence comprising the attenuator portion of the tryptophan operon may be placed 3 of the translational stop codons of the genome. This construction may now allow for the effective termination of transcription of the mRNA. The regulation of expression of any gene includes, but is not limited to the construction and use of promoter operator systems, A T rich sequences, transcriptional and translational termination sequences, and any other modified gene construct either naturally occurring or synthetically made which contributes to an optimal system for expression of a protein in a compatible host cell. 5.3. PREPARATION OF FUSION PROTEINS To maximize the level of expression of the cloned PRVDNA sequences it may be desirable to ligate these sequences to a gene encoding another protein, such as a host cell protein. If the host cell protein is large and inherently contains an assayable function additional advantages are obtained because expression of the ligated genes may result in a fusion protein product that can be identified on the basis of its large molecular weight and assayable function. For example, production of a PRV related polypeptide fused to B galactosidase, hereinafter referred to as PRV galactosidase fusion protein offers several advantages for cloning and expression of a PRV genetic sequence in an E.coli host. First, fusion protein production simplifies the identification and isolation of the protein product. The unfused PRV related protein i.e., unfused to B galactosidase produced by E. coli transformants is smaller than the fusion protein and as such might co migrate with several other host proteins when analyzed by SDSpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. However, a fusion protein can often be easily detected and identified by SDS uolyacrylamide electrophoresis SDS PAGE due to its unique high molecular weight.Second, retention of enzymatic function of the host protein can be used to identify transformants and may also allow for an approximation of the level of protein production hence expression directed by the vector using a colorimetric assay specific for ss galactosidase activity according to the method of Miller pages 47 55, and 352 355 in Experiments in MolecularGenetics, Cold Spring Harbor Press, New York, NY, 1972 .Third, as discussed in Section 2.1., hybrid gene sequences, e.g., procaryotic nucleotide sequences ligated to eucaryotic nucleotide sequences, when expressed in procaryotes result in production of fusion proteins which may be protected from host cell proteolysis. The present invention is not limited to the production of a PRV ss galactosidase fusion protein any gene of either eucaryotic or procaryotic origin may be ligated in phase with a PRV genetic sequence to provide advantages similar to the PRV ss galactosidase fusion protein product. Examples include, but are not limited to galactokinase trp D, E or leader pilus genes and eucaryotic genes, such as thymidine kinase, B globin, SV 40 T antigen, bovine growth hormone orRous Sarcoma Virus transforming gene. In order to construct a hybrid gene which encodes a fusion protein, the two genes must be joined within open coding sequences such that the correct reading frame of each is maintained. Also, as previously explained, if the host cell is a strain which represses or inhibits the action of the promoter, the fusion protein will be produced only in response to induction. 5.4. PREPARATION OF UNFUSED PROTEIN .As previously explained, transformants which produce unfused proteins, generally do so in smaller quantities than transformants which produce fusion proteins this is true even when the gene sequence for the unfused protein is under the control of an inducible promoter. In addition, the unfused proteins produced by bacterial transformants may be less stable than fusion proteins. In an alternate embodiment of the present invention, a host cell transformant can be engineered to produce, for example, large quantities of both fused PRV B galactosidase fusion protein and unfused PRV related proteins which will coaggregate and can be purified easily. See U.S. PatentApplication Serial No. 573,642 filed January 25, 1984 toGeorge et al. which is herein incorporated by reference. Three embodiments of this mode of the invention are described in the subsections below. 5.4.1. CO TRANSFORMATION OF HOST CELLS Any appropriate host cell can be co transformed with two or more plasmids. One plasmid carries the desired unfused protein gene and one plasmid carries a fusion protein gene.Each gene should be under the control of a promoter and translational control elements. The same or different promoter systems may be used to control expression of each gene. If a different promoter is used for each gene sequence then the ratio of the synthesis of the sequences may be controlled by varying the degree of induction of each promoter. In addition, the two plasmids may carry different selectable drug markers for antibiotic resistance e.g., tetracycline and ampicillin resistance and may be maintained within the same cell if grown in the presence of the two antibiotics. With both plasmids in the cell, synthesis of the fusion protein and the labile unfused protein can occur. Thesetransformed cells produce insoluble aggregates which contain both the unfused proteins and the large fusion protein. There is no requirement that the fusion protein be a PRV fusion protein. In fact, any combination of fusion protein with unfused protein will have similar aggregation and stabilization properties. For example, a significant stabilization of the unfused bovine growth hormone hereinafter referred to as BGH protein was observed when two plasmids were used to transform ene host cell, each plasmid directing the synthesis of its respective protein unfused BGH and porcine parvovirus ss galactosidase fusion protein PPV ss galactosidase . Pulsechase experiments indicated that the half life of. the unfused modified BGH proteins had increased from a 1 2 minute level to between 30 minutes and 1 hour. Additionally, when these proteins were produced in large amounts within the cell, they form insoluble aggregates which contain both the unfused BGH protein and the large PPV ss galactosidase fusion protein.Subsequent purification of the aggregate proteins indicated that the protein could be readily obtained in gram quantities. The cloning and expression of nucleotide sequences encoding BGH is described in U.S. Pat. ApplicationSerial No. 548,917 to George et al., filed November 7, 1983. 5.4.2. TRANSFORMATION OF HOST CELLS WITH ONE PLASMID CARRYING TWO GENES In an alternate embodiment of the present invention, plasmids which carry both the unfused protein gene and the larger fusion protein gene on a single vector are designed and constructed. As described supra for the co infection scheme, this embodiment of the invention is suitable for any combination of fusion protein and any unfused protein. The plasmids are constructed such that each gene on the plasmid has its own promoter and expression control elements.The same or different promoter systems may be used to control expression of each gene, therefore this embodiment of the present invention also allows for the regulation of the ratio of the fusion protein and the desired gene product. 5.4.3. MODIFICATION OF THE FUSION PROTEIN GENE In one embodiment of the present invention, a recombinant plasmid which encodes a PRV fusion protein is altered at the junction of the two gene sequences which comprise the fusion protein gene. A chain termination sequence such as amber TAG , ochre TAA , or opal TGA is located between the two gene sequences the chain terminator must be in phase with the translational reading frames of both gene sequences. Such an alteration may be accomplished by cleaving the plasmid at a restriction site or sites located between the two gene sequences and then ligating a nucleotide linker sequence encoding a chain terminator such as amber, ochre, or opal into the cleaved site on the plasmid so that the chain terminator is in phase with the translational reading frames of both gene sequences. See for example U.S. Pat.Application Serial No. 510,551, toWatson et al., filed July 6, 1983 which is herein incorporated by reference. Introduction of these amber, ochre, or opal modified plasmids into a host cell containing the appropriate tRNA suppressors results in the synthesis of both an unfused protein as well as a fusion protein since suppression is significantly less than 100 . A tRNA suppressor is a tRNA that has undergone a modification generally the result of a mutation of the tRNA gene that allows the tRNA to recognize the termination codon and results in the occasional but not regular insertion of an amino acid at the site of the termination codon. Therefore, host cells carrying the suppressor tRNA characteristically produce both the unfused protein and a fusion protein of normal length.Every nonsense or termination suppressor has a characteristic efficiency, indicated by the ratio of the two protein chains produced. There are at least t wbways to jntroduce the amber, ochre or opal modified plasmids into a suppressor cell background 1 the transformant i.e., a host cell transformed with amber, ochre or opal modified plasmid can be infected with a lysogenic transducing phage that TBSt9,14,19,24 carries the appropriate suppressor tRNA gene e.g., 80 pSU3 carries the supF suppressor of amber mutations or 2 the amber, ochre or opal modified plasmids san be used to transform cell lines which contain suppressor tRNAs of amber, ochre, or opal respectively. Examples of such strains include but are not limited to LE392 containing suE and supF suppressors of amber mutations , YMC containing supF , and C600 supE .The various amber suppressor tRNA genes in E. coli include but are not limited to supB, supC, supD, supE, sups, supG, supL, supM, supN, supO, supP, supU, supV the various ochre suppressor tRNA genes in E. coli include but are not limited to supB, sups, supG, supL, supM, supN, supO, supV and the various opal suppressor tRNA genes in E. coli include but are not limited to supK see Bachmann and Low, 1980, MicrobiologicalReviews 44 1 1 56 . The host cells containing the appropriate suppressor tRNA gene are transformed with the amber, ochre, or opal modified plasmids which can produce the protein as both a fusion .protein and as an unfused protein the proportions of fused to unfused protein produced depends upon the extent of suppression in the host cell . The amber, ochre, or opal modified plasmids may be further modified to ensure that translation of the corresponding mRNA transcript will terminate at the 3 terminus of the fusion protein gene. Proper chain termination is important because it contributes to the overall efficiency of translation. A number of approaches which may be used to effect chain termination are described below. In one embodiment, all three chain termination sequences may be inserted in tandem at the 3 region of the fusion protein gene so that they are in phase with the translational reading frame of the gene sequence. The presence of the chain terminator sequences in tandem will reduce the chance of read through, consequently, translation will terminate at the chain termination codons on the mRNA transcript. Alternatively, one or more chain termination sequences of the appropriate type may be inserted into the 3 region iof the fusion protein gene. For example, an amber modified plasmid may be further modified by the insertion in phase of one or more opal or ochre sequences at the 3 end of the fusion protein gene. When this plasmid is inserted into a host cell containing an amber tRNA suppressor such as supD, supE, sups, supP, supU, supV in E. coli that does not suppress ochre or opal, the host cell will produce both the fusion protein and the unfused protein and translation of the fusion protein will terminate at the location of the opal and or ochre codons located at the 3 end of the mRNA transcript. In a similar fashion, an opal modified plasmid may be further modified by the insertion in phase of one or more amber or ochre sequences at the 3 end of the fusion protein gene. When this plasmid is inserted into a host cell containing an opal tRNA suppressor such as supK in E. coli that does not suppress amber or ochre, the host cell will produce both the fusion protein and the unfused protein and translation of the fusion protein will terminate at the location of the amber and or ochre codons located at the 3 end of the mRNA transcript. Similarly, an ochre modified plasmid may be further modified by the insertion in phase of one or more opal sequences at the 3 end of the fusion protein gene. When this plasmid is inserted into a host cell containing an ochre tRNA suppressor such as supB, supC, supG, supL, sups, supN, supO, supV in E. coli that does not suppress opal, the host cell will produce both the fusion protein and the unfused protein bands translation of the fusion protein will terminate at the location of the opal codon or codons located at the 3 end of the mRNA transcript. 5.5. IDENTIFICATION OF THE PROTEINS PRODUCED Once transformants which contain the correct DNA construction are identified, analyses of the immunoreactivity and antigenicity of the products expressed by the transformants t 9., fusion proteins or PRV related polypeptides are required. Immunological analyses of these expression products of the PRV DNA sequences are especially important because the ultimate goal is to use the PRV related products e.g., the fusion proteins, PRV related polypeptides or proteins so produced in vaccine formulations.The analysis of immunoreactivity is most easily carried out using antisera directed against the PRV structural protein, whereas immunogenicity may be evaluated by determining test animal antisera titers which develop in response to immunization with the PRV related product and the ability of the antisera so produced to neutralize PRV infectivity. Identification of the PRV related products described in this invention is, therefore, based upon two requirements.First, the PRV related product can be produced in response to induction of the promoter i.e., if the promoter is inducible . It is also possible that promoters used to express PRV genes in other systems such as yeast will be constitutive rather than inducible. For example, the PRV gene can be transferred to cell lines that constituitively synthezise the PRV gene product. Second, the PRV related product should be reactive with antibodies directed against the relevant PRV glycoprotein the PRV related product should be immunoreactive whether it results from the expression of an entire PRV gene sequence, a portion of a PRV gene sequence or from two or more gene sequences which are ligated to direct the production of a fusion protein.This reactivity may be demonstrated by standard immunological techniques, such as immunoprecipitations, immunodiffusion, radio immune competition, immunoelectrophoresis or the immunological detection of proteins which were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred to nitrocellulose. 5.6. PURIFICATION OF THE PROTEINS PRODUCED Crude vaccines may be prepared using intact cells, cell extracts E. coli or the like or cell lysates. Recombinant viruses such as the recombinant vaccinia virus, baculovirus insect viruses , and the like may also be used advantageously to produce vaccines. Live or killed virus recombinants can be made against infectious agents such as PRV. These vaccines can be made to express only a single PRV antigen. Certain vaccines might require the use of purified proteins. Furthermore, the purified proteins may be used in diagnostic procedures. In order to purify the proteins produced, cells containing the cloned gene are grown up in a large volume, and the protein produced after induction of the promoter is isolated from such cells or from the medium if the protein is excreted. The protein may be isolated and purified either by standard chromatography, including ion exchange, affinity or sizing resins, by centrifugation, or by any other standard technique for the purification of proteins. Fusion proteins can form aggregates when overproduced inE. coli and unfused proteins i.e., unfused to ss galactosi dase may co aggregate with the fusion protein within the host cell. An efficient method for isolating these aggregate forming proteins for example, separating theCro PRV proteins from the Cro PRV ss galactosidase proteins is particularly useful for isolating the fusion proteins produced in the present invention. These proteins or the isolated aggregates can then be used in vaccine formulations.Indeed, the aggregates which may be used in vaccine formulations are also a significant intermediate product in the purification of proteins. These aggregates may be isolated by the methods described in the embodiment of the present invention. Purification, hereinafter referred to as aggregate purification, involves the extraction, separation and or purification of aggregate forming proteins from protein mixtures such as lysates of cell cultures by disruption of cells followed by washing the aggregated material. Additionally, the aggregated material may be solubilized by the addition of a solvent that is both a strong hydrogen acceptor and a strong hydrogen donor or a combination of solvents each having one of these properties the aggregate forming proteins may then be precipitated by dilution with a compatible buffer or may be further purified by column chromatography.Suitable protein solvents include, but are not limited to urea from about 4M to about 8M , formamide at least about 80 , volume volume basis , guanidine hydrochloride from about 4M to about 8M1. Other solvents which are capable of solubilizing aggregate forming proteins are, for example SDS sodium dodecyl sulfate , 70 formic acid. In some instances these solvents may be inappropriate for use due to the possibility of irreversible denaturation of the proteins, hence a lack of immunogenicity and lack of activity.Although guanidine hydrochloride and other similar agents are denaturants, studies indicate that this denaturation is not irreversible and that renaturation may occur upon removal by dialysis, for example or dilution of the denaturant, allowing re formation of immunologically and or biologically active protein. It should be emphasized that many variations of these procedures are possible and may be used in the present invention. One embodiment of the fusion protein isolation technique is outlined as follows hereinafter referred to as the nondenaturing aggregate purification procedure the cell pellet is quick frozen using dry ice methanol, weighed, and 3 4 g of cells are resuspended in at least 25 ntt of a buffer solution OD600 50 5 0 mM Tris HCl tris hydroxymethylaminomethane hydrochloride , pH 8.0, 2 mM EDTA ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and 200 mM NaC1 . That is, the cells are suspended in a buffer solution at an approximate concentration of from about 100 to 200 grams of cells liter. Concentrations less than about 160 grams liter are preferred.To this suspension lysozyme is added to a final concentration of about 130 pg ml and the resulting mixture is allowed to stand at 40C for 20 minutes with occasional shaking. Nonidet P40 NP 40, Shell trademark, polyoxyethylene 9 E tert octylphenol , a nonionic detergent used to solubilize membranes, is added to a final concentration of about 0.1 and the solution mixed.Then, the suspension is homogenized for approximately 1 minute using a Polytron grinder Brinkman Instruments,Westbury, NY or equivalent. The suspension is centrifuged at 8,000 x g for 30 minutes, and the pellet resuspended in a wash buffer, e.g., 20 mM Tris HCl pH 7.2 , 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaC1 and 2 Triton X 100 tpolyoxyethylene 9 10 p tert octylphenol, a non ionic detergent, and homogenized with the Polytron grinder. This step of centrifugation, washing, and grinding may be repeated to further wash the pellet and remove as much cellular debris as possible. In another embodiment, the cell pellet may also be quick frozen. Cells are resuspended in 50 me of lysis buffer 50mMTris, pH7.9, 200mM NaCl, 2mM EDTA, 2mM THE . To this suspension, approximately 200 vg mt lOmg of lysozyme is added and the mixture is allowed to stand on ice for 10 minutes. Zwittergent 3 14 Calbiochem Behring Corp, LaJolla,CA is added, to a final concentration of 0.5 and the suspension incubated on ice for 10 minutes. The suspension is then sonicated using a soni probe for about 3 x 10 pulses at a setting of 3, to reduce the viscosity of the suspension.After sonication MgCl2 is added to 5mM and DNase is added to 50ug mt for 15 minutes at 370C. The sonicated suspensions are overlayed in two 50 mt round bottom plastic centrifuge tubes onto 10 m of 40 sucrose defind in PBS or saline trisEDTA buffer STE and centrifuged in a Sorvall swinging bucket rotor for 30 minutes at 13,000 r.p.m. The supernatant is removed and, PBS or STE is added to the pellet which is resuspended by vortexing or by sonication. Alternatively, the pellet of aggregates may be further treated by the addition of a denaturant hereinafter referred to as the denaturing aggregate purification procedure as follows The suspension is centrifuged, the supernatant removed completely and the pellet resuspended in about onefifth volume of 6M guanidine hydrochloride in distilled water . For instance, aggregate protein derived from 3 g of cells washed with 25 mt of buffer should be resuspended at this step in 5 mt of 6M guanidine hydrochloride solution. It may be difficult to resuspend the pellet at this stage and sonication or homogenization may be required in order to obtain a homogenous solution.The solution is allowed to stand at 220C for 20 minutes and is then centrifuged at 8,000 x g for 30 minutes to remove debris, saving the supernatant which at this point contains the fusion protein. The fusion protein is precipitated from the guanidine hydrochloride supernatant by the addition of about four volumes of aqueous buffer. Almost any aqueous buffer may be used at this stage however, the addition of a small amount of non ionic detergent, such as 0.5 NP 40 or Triton X 100 may be helpful. This suspension is allowed to stand at 40C for 30 minutes and is then centrifuged at 8,000 x g for 10 minutes. The supernatant is discarded, the pellet containing the fusion protein precipitate is resuspended in an appropriate buffer, e.g., Phosphate Buffered Saline PBS in any appropriate volume. Brief sonication or homogenization may aid in obtaining a homogenous suspension or slurry. It may be desirable to remove any remaining DNA from the suspension of aggregates or the fusion protein precipitate before using either as an immunogen. To this end the suspension of aggregates or fusion protein precipitate is pelleted and resuspended in wash buffer containing no detergent. To either suspension a final concentration of about 10 mM MICE2 and 2 pg mQ Deoxyribonuclease I P.L. igiochemicals, Milwaukee, WI is added. After incubation at 370C for 30 minutes, the suspension of aggregates or fusion protein precipitate is pelleted by centrifugation, washed with buffer, repelleted, and resuspended in fresh buffer, thus removing most of the deoxyribonuclease. According to the denaturing aggregate purification procedure, fusion proteins may also be solubilized in 8M urea and subsequently dialysed to remove the urea. This is carried out by adding solid urea to a final urea concentration of 8M. Also added are EDTA to 10 mM, DTT to mM and Tris, pH 7.5 to 50 mM. The urea is then removed by dialysis usually against PBS. The pH and concentration of DTT can be adjusted to enhance solubilization. Another embodiment of the fusion protein isolation technique involves purification of aggregate proteins from larger volumes of culture. This method is a modification of the aggregate purification procedure described supra. The cell pellet is quick frozen in a dry ice ethanol bath, weighed, and approximately 30 60 g of cells are resuspended in 125 mt of B1P buffer 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA at 370C with shaking for 10 minutes. The partially resuspended cells are homogenized using a Polytron grinder BrinkmanInstruments, Westbury, NY . To this suspension 50 mg of lysozyme 10 mg mQ in B1P is added while the cells are further homogenized and the cells are placed at room temperature for 20 30 minutes. Nonidet P40 described supra is added ta a final concentration of 0.18 and the mixture is homogenized using a Polytron grinder for 5 minutes. The cell lysate i s centrifuged at 26,890 x g for 20 minutes using a SS 34 Sorvall rotor and the supernatant is discarded. The pellet is resuspended in 150 mt B2P buffer 10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1 Triton X 100 , homogenized for 2 5 minutes, and centrifuged for 20 minutes at 26,890 x g. This step is repeated, and the pellet containing the aggregate protein is then washed two times with water.Finally, the aggregate protein is resuspended in water using ithe Polytron grinder. In an alternate embodiment of the present invention, aggregates purified as described supra containing fused and unfused protein are solubilized, and soluble unfused viral protein is isolated. Aggregate protein 4 mg mt is suspended in 20 mQ of buffer 75 mM Tris HCl, 10M urea, and 0.5M ss mercaptoethanol , sonicated for 2 minutes, and heated at 650C for 30 minutes. the suspension is centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 20 minutes, and the supernatant is diluted by the addition of an equal volume of water. The sample is applied to a 30 m DE52 Diethylaminoethyl cellulose, Whatman Chemical Separation Ltd., Kent, England column. The column is washed with several volumes of buffer 30 mM Tris HCl, 4M urea, 50 mM B mercaptoethanol, pH 9.0 .The protein is eluted from the column using a gradient from 0 to 150 mM NaCl 400 mt of buffer containing 30 mM Tris HCl, 4M urea, 50 mM B mercaptoethanol, pH 9.0 . Fractions are collected and an aliquot of each fraction is analyzed by SDS PAGE for the presence of unfused protein.Fractions containing unfused protein are pooled and dialyzed against 30 mM Tris HCl, pH 9.0. Finally, the unfused protein is neutralized and concentrated at least 10 fold by ultrafiltration using an Amicon Model 8050 UltrafiltrationCell Amicon Corp., Danvers, MA . Alternatives to purification of the protein from genetically engineered recombinants include synthesis of polypeptides of PRV which are immunogenic and antigenic.Once the PRV glycoprotein genes are identified by the techniques described herein, their amino acid sequences can be deduced. Then, any method such as solid phase protein synthesis and the like can be used to synthesize these polypeptides or relevant portions thereof. These polypeptides maybe used in vaccine formulations or in diagnostic assays. 5.7. FORMULATION OF A VACCINE The purpose of this invention is to produce a polypeptide related to a PRV structural protein which may be used as an immunogen in a subunit vaccine to protect againstPRV infections. If the PRV related protein produced is immunoreactive with specific neutralizing antibodies, it would be expected that the PRV related protein would elicit an immune response capable of neutralizing the PRV virus in vivo. Vaccines made from genetically engineered immunogens should be safer than conventional vaccines made from attenuated or killed virus because there is no risk of infection of the recipient. For pseudorabies virus, the subunit vaccine offers several advantages. First, the subunit vaccine is safer than live attenuated vaccines. Infectious material is eliminated and thus acute or latent infections are avoided.Furthermore, subunit vaccines can be designed to be compatible with control and eradication programs. Subunit vaccines need contain only those viral antigens required to elicit a protective immune response. Other viral antigens that are not required for such a protective response can be excluded from the vaccine. These latter antigens can thus serve as diagnostic markers to enable differentiation of subunit vaccinated animals from PRV infected animals.Subunit vaccinated animals will not have antibodies against these excluded diagnostic antigens, whereas PRV infected animals will. With conventional vaccines, on the other hand, animals that have been vaccinated cannot be distinguished from those that have been infected, since both should have antibodies against most if not all viral antigens. The serologic test to distinguish vaccinates from infected animals would be a test for an excluded antigen. An infected animal would react positively with this InfectionTest whereas subunit vaccinates would remain negative. The excluded antigen would thus serve as a diagnostic reagent to be used to distinguish those animals that have beery vaccinated with the subunit vaccine from those animals that have been PRV infected. Therefore 3 classes of animals can be distinguished 1 seronegative animals which have never been infected or vaccinated would be negative by standard serum neutralization SN tests 2 animals which have been given the subunit vaccine will be positive by the SN test. However, a serologic test for one of the excluded diagnostic antigens an antigen present in whole virus but absent from the vaccine would indicate that subunit vaccinated animals are negative for the diagnostic antigen and 3 infected animals will be SN positive and serologically positive for the excluded diagnostic antigen. Presumably, vaccinated animals are more resistant to infection than are non vaccinated animals. Current control programs require maintenance of totally susceptible seronegative animals in order to maintain a herd certified to be free of virus. In such a herd, introduction of the virus results in disease and seroconversion in most if not all of the herd. In one embodiment of the present invention, the subunit vaccine would allow maintenance of Infection Test negative, subunit vaccinated animals which are protected from disease and partially or largely resistant to infection.If infection did occur in the herd, the Infection Test would detect these animals which are infected, and these can be eliminated. Alternatively, the genetically engineered PRV product may be used to produce antibodies for use im passive immunotherapy or as a diagnostic tool. For instance the PRV specific antibody may be labeled with a dye, an enzyme such as peroxidase, ferritin, a fluorescent compound, or a radioactive compound. Such a labeled antibody may be used to detect PRV antigens and, therefore, pseudorabies virus in various body fluids obtained from animals suspected to be infected with PRV. Such techniques for immunoassay in vitro diagnostic assays are well known and may be applied to body fluids obtained from mucous membranes, semen, blood and excrement. Finally, the genetically engineered product may be used as antigen in an in vitro immunoassay to determine and monitor the titers of antisera in vaccinated animals. Although the PRV ss galactosidase fusion protein product itself may be useful in a vaccine formulation, it may be advantageous to first remove and or modify all or part of the ss galactosidase moiety in order to produce a more effectivePRV related immunogen. While whole cells or crude extracts of induced transformants may be used to vaccine animals, genetically engineered PRV related protein may also be isolated and purified from the host cells using standard protein isolation techniques or techniques previously described see Section 5.6 . In fact, any of the methods used to isolate aggregates from host cells may be used in vaccine formulation. The final purified product may then be adjusted to an appropriate concentration and formulated with any suitable vaccine adjuvant and packaged for use.Suitable adjuvants include but are not limited to surface active substances, e.g., hexadecylamine, octadecylamine, lysolecithin, dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide, N,N dioctadecyl N N bis 2hydroxyethyl propane diamine , methoxyhexadecylglycerol, and pluronic polyols polyanions, e.g., pyran, dextran sulfate, ipoly IC, polyacrylic acid, carbopol peptides, e.g., muramyl dipeptide, dimethylglycine, tuftsin oil emulsions and alum. Freut s adjuvanUt is no longer used in va ccine formulations for human or for food animals because it contains nonmetabolizable mineral oil and is a carcinogen, however, the mineral oils are widely used in commercial veterinary vaccines. Finally, the protein product may be incorporated into liposomes for use in a vaccine formulation, or may be conjugated to polysaccharides or other polymers. The genetically engineered DNA molecules described herein allow great flexibility for vaccine production. For example, a vaccine could be formulated using a PRV related protein produced by transformants containing any portion of the genetic sequences of PRV encoding a structural protein or multiple copies of such sequences in tandem. The PRV genetic sequences or portion thereof may be ligated to genes that encode other immunogens so that the fused protein product could be used in the preparation of multivalent vaccines.Additionally, the PRV genetic sequences or portion thereof could be ligated to other PRV gene sequences or portions thereof in any combination. Finally, the genetic sequences of PRV may be reorganized to increase the immunogenicity of the vaccine. For example, the PRV genetic sequences may be altered so that the protein product presents specific epitopes to the immune system e.g., an antigenic site of the protein that is normally only partially exposed may be presented to the immune system or the regions of the genetic sequences that encode immunosuppressive portions of the protein can be deleted or the regions that separate epitopes can be deleted. 6. EXAMPLE According to the method of the present invention, a combined cloning expression protocol was utilized to identify a pseudorabies virus PRV glycoprotein gene within the PRV genome. Antibodies were made against authentic PRV glycoproteins. PRV genomic DNA was isolated from purified nucleocapsids and fragmented into approximately 500 base pair lengths. These random PRV DNA fragments were inserted into an expression vector and the PRV DNA sequences were expressed Xas proteins fused to B galactosidase. PRV specific glycoprotein sequences were identified in these PRV ss galactosidase fusion proteins by Western blot analysis.ThePRV DNA sequences represented in the expression plasmids were mapped to the 20.3 kb BamHI 2 fragment within PRV genomic IONA. Further subcloning of the PRV DNA genome more precisely located these sequences to a 3.6 Kb SphI NcoI fragment.Appropriate PRV DNA sequences were cloned into expression vectors and analyzed by restriction enzyme mapping and DNA sequencing. The gene product which was isolated as a fusion protein was then formulated for use as an immunogen. The procedures are described in detail below. 6.1. GENERAL PROCEDURES USED FOR PREPARATION OF THE PLASMIDS The following subsections describe the general procedures and materials used for DNA isolation, enzyme reactions and ligation reactions. 6. 1.1 . PLASMID DNA ISOLATION Host cell bacteria Escherichia coli, E. coli were transformed Gautier and Bonewald, 1980, Molec. Gen. Genet.178 375 and large microgram quantities of plasmid DNA were isolated from cultures of E. coli transformants grown inL broth. Briefly, overnight cultures of cells 10 mt were prepared in L broth containing 100 pg mt ampicillin. Ten m cultures were added to one liter of L broth containing ampicillin in a 2 liter flask. Cultures were incubated at 370C with shaking until the OD600 was approximately 0.8 to 1.0. Cells were amplified by addition of 300 t g mt spectinomycin to the medium and further incubated for at least 16 hours. Cells were pelleted in a GSA rotor Sorvall,Wilmington, DE at 6,000 RPM for 15 minutes at 40C.Cells were then resuspended in 30 mt of 25 sucrose, 0.05 M Tris, pH 8.0 and 10 mt of lysozyme t5 mg mQ in 0.25 M Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mt 0.25 M, EDTA, pH 8.0 were added and incubated on ice for 15 minutes. 50 mt of detergent mix 5 mt 10 Triton X100 in 0.25 M Tris, pH 8.0, 125 mt 0.25mt EDTA, 25 mt 1.0 MTris, pH 8.0, 345 mt water was added quickly, mixed gently and incubated on ice for 30 minutes. The cells were centrifuged in Ultraclear tubes Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA 1 inch X 3.5 inch in a SW28 rotor BeckmanInstruments at 27,000 RPM for 1.5 hours at 150C.Predigested Pronase Sigma, St. Louis, MO was added to the supernatant at a final concentration of 250 Pg mQ and the mixture was incubated at 370C for 30 minutes. The DNA was phenol extracted by adding one half the volume of STE lTE l 0.01M Tris, pH 8.0 and 0.001 M EDTA, pH 8.0 plus 0.15 M NaCll saturated phenol. After mixing, the mixture was centrifuged in a Beckman TJ 6 rotor at 1 000 RPM for 25 minutes at 200C. The aqueous layer was removed and ethanol precipitated by adding one tenth the volume of 3 M NaAcetate and 2 times the volume of 200C ethanol. DNA was precipitated at 200C overnight or 700C for 30 minutes. TheDNA was pelleted by centrifugation in a GSA 4 rotor at 6,000RPM for 20 minutes at 40C. Air dried pellets were resuspended in a total volume of 19 mt in TE 10 0.02 M Tris, pH 8.0, 0.01 M EDTA, pH 8.0 .The plasmid DNA was then purified by centrifugation to equilibrium in cesium chloride ethidium bromide density gradients Kaniatis et al.,Molecular Cloning, 1982, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory p. 93 . The cesium chloride solution was centrifuged at 48,000 rpm for 42 hours or 40,000 rpm for 72 hours in a 70.1 Ti or 50 Ti rotor. The plasmid DNA band was collected, the ethidium bromide extracted using isoamyl alcohol and the DNA was then ethanol precipitated. Ethanol precipitates were centrifuged in a SS34 rotor Sorvall for 20 minutes at 10,000 RPM to pellet the DNA. Pellets were air dried and resuspended in TE 1 buffer. Small quantities of plasmid DNA free from chromosomalDNA and excess protein were quickly prepared by the following alkaline minipreparation. Host cell bacteria were grown to saturation. The cells 1 nit were centrifuged for 20 seconds in an Eppendorf centrifuge and the supernatant was removed. Cells were resuspended by vortexing in 100 pQ GTE buffer 50 mM glucose, i25 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA and then incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature. 200 ijt of alkali SDS solution 0.2N NaOH, 1 SDS was added, mixed well, and incubated for on ice for 5 minutes 150 l of 5 M acetate solution was then added. The sample was vortexed vigorously for 2 seconds and placed on ice for a further 5 minutes.The mixture was then centrifuged for 1 minute in an Eppendorf centrifuge and supernatants transferred to new Eppendorf tubes. 0.9 mL of 1008 ethanol was added, mixed well and incubated for 1 minute at room temperature. The mixture was then centrifuged for 5 minutes and the supernatant discarded. The pellet was washed with 0.9 ml 70 ethanol and centrifuged in an Eppendorf centrifuge for 20 seconds. Pellets were dried under vacuum and resuspended in 20 l of water. 6.1.2. CONDITIONS FOR RESTRICTION ENZYME DIGESTIONS Restriction enzymes used in the present application were obtained from New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA, unless otherwise indicated. An enzyme unit is defined as the amount required to digest 1.0 iig of lambda DNA in 1 hour at 370C in a total reaction mixture of 50 iit. All restriction enzyme total digestions were accomplished under the following conditions each 1 g DNA was incubated with 2 units of enzyme at 370C for 60 minutes in 20 l buffer. 6.1.3. RESTRICTION ENZYME BUFFERS The buffer used for KpnI, SacI or SmaI digestions consisted of 6.6 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4 , 6.6 mM MgCl2 and 6.6 mM ss ME ss mercaptoethanol . The buffer used for Bi1II, EcoRI, PstI or PvuII digestions consisted of 60 mM NaCl, 6.6 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4 , 6.6 mM MgC12 and 6.6 mM B ME . The buffer used for BamHI, BstEII, NcoI, SalI, SphI, orXhoI digestions consisted of 150 mM NaCl, 6.6 mM Tris Hcl pH 7.4 , 6.6 mM MgCl2 and 6.6 mM B ME. It should be noted that whenever two or more restriction endonuclease reactions are performed on DNA, the reaction in low salt buffer is accomplished before the reaction in high salt buffer. If two enzymes require the same buffer, then the reactions may be performed simultaneously. 6.1.4. MODIFICATION OF DNA S1 nuclease degrades RNA or denatured DNA i.e., single stranded DNA into mononucleotides, but will not under proper conditions degrade double stranded DNA orDNA RNA hybrids. One unit of S1 nuclease BoehringerMannheim, Indianapolis, IN is defined as the amount of enzyme required to acid solubilize 1 Pg of denatured calf thymus DNA in 30 minutes at 370C. The reaction buffer used for S1 nuclease consisted of 30 mM sodium acetate pH 4.6 , 250 mM NaCl, 1 mM ZnSO4 and 5 glycerol. S1 digestions were accomplished by incubating 2000 units of enzyme with 0.1 Pg DNA and 10 g RNA at 450C for 30 minutes. Exonuclease VII Exo VII degrades single stranded DNA ssDNA . The mechanism of action of Exo VII appears to be that of a processive exonuclease. One unit of Exo VII Bethesda Research Laboratories, Rockville, MD is defined as the amount of enzyme which produces 1 nmol of nucleotide monomers in 30 minutes at 370C using linear, denatured 3H SV40 DNA as a substrate. The reaction buffer used for ExoVII consisted of 10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.9 , 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM B ME and 8 mM EDTA. Exo VII digestions were accomplished using 4 units of Exo VII per 0.1 g DNA and 10 Pg RNA in a 250 t reaction volume for 1 hour at 450C. 6.1.5. DNA POLYMERASE REACTION DNA polymerases catalyze the stepwise elongation of aDNA chain. Chain growth is in the 5 to 3 direction i.e., addition of nucleotides occurs at the 3 terminus and the sequence of the polymer is determined by that of the template because the incoming nucleotide must be complementary to the template, i.e., form the correct base pair with the template strand. The known DNA polymerases cannot initiate chain synthesis, thus DNA synthesis requires a primer strand with a free 3 hydroxyl terminus annealed to a template strand.Chain elongation proceeds by the nucleophilic attack of the 3 hydroxyl terminus of the primer on the 5 phosphate of the incoming nucleotide. The new chain is base paired and antiparallel to the template strand. As a result of the DNA polymerase reaction the single stranded template strand is filled in or converted to a double stranded DNA molecule. A second important feature of the DNA polymetases is the proof reading function. A 3 to 5 exonuclease activity associated with DNA polymerase I acts on nonbase paired termini and can degrade both single and double stranded DNA in the 3 to 5 direction yielding mononucleotides. Thus an incorrectly added nucleotide is removed before polymerization continues, and the fidelity of the enzyme is further enhanced. DNA polymerase I also has a 5 to 3 exonuclease activity specific for double stranded DNA yielding 5 mononucleotides and oligonucleotides which can also excise mismatched regions in DNA. Proteolytic treatment of DNA polymerase I by the method of Klenow Rlenow et al., 1971, Eur. J. Biochem. 22 371 yields two fragments, large and small. The large fragment orKlenow fragment 76,000 da ltons retains the polymerase and 3 5 exonuclease activity whereas the small fragment retains the 5 3 exonuclease activity. One unit of DNA polymerase I or DNA polymerase I large fragment New England Biolabs, everly, MA is defined as the amount converting 10 nmoles of deoxyribonucleotides to an acid insoluble form in 30 minutes at 370C.The assay conditions for both enzymes are the same except that the reaction mixture for DNA polymerase I contains 67 mM KPO4 pH 7.5 while the reaction mixture for the Klenow fragment contains 40 mK KP04 pH 7.5 in the following buffer 6.6 mM MgCl2, 1.0 mM ss ME, 2 mM dAT copolymer, 33 M dATP, 33 M H dTTP and enzyme. In the present application, when DNA polymerase large Klenow fragment was used to fill in single stranded DNA or cohesive ends that result from restriction enzyme cleavage, the following procedure was employed restriction enzyme reactions were terminated by heating at 680C for 10 minutes.To the same reaction mixture a final concentration of 50 YM of each deoxynucleotide triphosphate was added and for each microgram of DNA in the reaction mixture 10 100 units of DNA polymerase Klenow fragment was added. In other words an excess of DNA polymerase Klenow fragment was used to ensure that single stranded ends were completely filled in. 6.1.6. GEL PURIFICATION OF DNA FRAGMENTS After restriction enzyme or nuclease treatment, DNA fragments of varying sizes were separated by gel electrophoresis in either agarose or polyacrylamide slab gels at low voltage approximately 2 volts cm for agarose gels and l0 volts cm for polyacrylamide gels , stained with ethidium bromide and visualized under ultraviolet light Southern, 1979, Methods in Enzymology 68 152 . In order to recover particular DNA fragments from gels, the appropriate bands were sliced out of the gel and the DNAWas electroeluted into dialysis tubing. The DNA was then isolated on DEAE cellulose, appropriate fractions pooled, or ethanol precipitated, and resuspended in the appropriate buffer Smith, 1980, Methods in Enzymology 65 371 . DNA fragments were also separated on low melting point agarose LMP agarose, Bethesda Research Laboratories, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD . The appropriate DNA bands were excised and melted at 650C, diluted with 10 volumes of TEN l0mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl and then applied to aDEAE cellulose column as described above. 6.1.7. DNA LIGATION All ligations were accomplished using T4 DNA ligase NewEngland Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA . One unit of T4 DNA ligase is defined as the amount required to yield 508 ligation of HindIII fragments of bacteriophage lambda DNA in 30 minutes at 160C in 20 pl of ligase buffer at a 5 DNA termini concentration of 0.12M 300 vg m . DNA ligations were carried out in ligase buffer consisting of 60 mM Tris HCl pH 7.8 , 10 mM MgC12, 20 mM dithiothreitol DTT , 1.0 mM ATP and a DNA concentration ranging from 15 50 pg mt. Ligation reactions were incubated 4 to 24 hours at room temperature using approximately 300 units of T4 DNA ligase per 10 Pt reaction volume. I 6.2. PRODUCTION OF PRV STOCK INFECTION POOLS The Becker strain of Pseudorabies PRV was used to infect PK15 cells derived from porcine kidney, NationalVeterinary Services Laboratories, Ames, Iowa . Infected PK15 cells were propagated in Dulbecco s modified Eagle s medium supplemented with 10 fetal calf serum GIBCO, Grand Island,NY . 10 20 100 mM tissue culture plates of PK15 cells were infected with 0.1 plaque forming units pfu cell of PRV and the virus was allowed to absorb for 1 hour. Culture medium containing 5 fetal calf serum was added and the plates were incubated for 48 hours at 370C. The plates were then scraped to dislodge the cells, pooled, sonicated and aliquots frozen at 700C. The average titer for virus produced in this way was 5 X 108pfu mQ. 6.3 EXTRACTION OF DNA FROM PRV NUCLEOCAPSIDS PRV stock infection pools were produced as described supra. The following method for extraction of DNA from nucleocapsids was used 1 Cells from 10 infected roller bottles were resuspended in 10 mt LCM buffer 0.5 NP40, 30 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 3.6 mM Caul2, 5 mM MgC12, 125 mM KC11 0.5 mM EDTA and 6 mM B ME . Nucleocapsids were extracted by addition of 1 mt Freon 1,1, 2 Trichloro 1,2, 2, trifluoroethane , shaken and subsequently centrifuged at low speed for approximately 5 minutes. The upper aqueous phase was removed and reextracted with 1 mt freon. 2 The aqueous phase was split in two and layered onto 3 mt each of a 5 and 45 glycerol in LCM buffer step gradient in Beckman SW27 or SW28 centrifuge tubes.Nucleocapsids were pelleted by centrifugation at 25,000 RPM for 1 hour at 40C. 3 Each nucleocapsid pellet was resuspended by mild sonication after addition of 10 mt TNE 50 mM Tris, HC1 pH 17.5, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA . SDS to give a final concentration of 0.5 and an equal volume of phenol were added and the mixture was gently phenol extracted. After low speed centrifugation, the upper aqueous phase was removed and re extracted 2 times with phenol chloroform isoamyl alcohol 25 24 1 and 1 time with chloroform isoamyl alcohol 24 1 . Two volumes of ethanol were added to the aqueous phase and the DNA was precipitated at 200C for at least 3 hours. 4 The DNA was recovered by centrifugation and dissolved in a total of 12 mt TE 8 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mMEDTA . The final volume was measured and cesium chloride was added in ratio of 3.2 mt solution per 4 g cesium chloride.The DNA was then centrifuged to equilibrium at 45,000 RPM in a Beckman Type 50 rotor. 5 Fractions were collected and subjected to electrophoresis on a 18 agarose gel. Fractions containing high molecular weight PRV DNA were pooled and dialyzed against 2 3 changes of TE 8 buffer. The DNA was then used directly or after ethanol precipitation and resuspension in an appropriate buffer. The yield of DNA after this procedure was approximately 200 400 9. 6.4. IDENTIFICATION OF PRV SPECIFIC GLYCOPROTEINS To identify the glycoproteins present in the PRV virion, the virus structural proteins present in PRV infected PK15 cells were examined using goat antibodies raised againstTriton X 100 disrupted PRV virions goat anti PRV serum .6.4.1. PREPARATION OF CELL EXTRACTS AND IMMUNOPRECIPITATION 100 mm plates of confluent PK15 cells were infected with 10 pfu cell of PRV. Four hours post infection the culture medium was removed, and infected cell proteins were radioisotopically labeled by the addition of medium 3 containing 50 pCi mt of 35S methionine or H glucosamine Amersham, England and continued incubation at 370C. The medium used for 35S methionine labeling was methionine freeDulbecco s E4 medium containing 2 fetal calf serum, while labeling with 3H glucosamine was accomplished in Dulbecco sModified Eagles Medium E4 medium containing 2 fetal calf serum.At 20 hours post infection, cells wee harvested by removing the culture fluid, washing the cell monolayer with phosphate buffered saline PBS and scraping the cells into 5 EQ of PBS. The cells were centrifuged 3000 X g for 5 minutes , resuspended in 5 mQ of IP buffer 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 NP40, 1 deoxycholate DOC , 0.1 SDS and the lysate cleared by centrifugation at 40,000RPM in a SW50.1 Beckman rotor for 30 minutes at 40C. For immunoprecipitations, approximately one tenth of the total infected cell lysate 400 pQ was incubated for 1 hour on ice with 20 t of either normal goat serum or goat antiPRV serum. Immune complexes were collected by adsorption to protein A bearing Staphylococcus aureus Pansorbin,Calbiochem Behring Corp., La Jolla, CA as described by S. W.Kessler 1975, J. Immunol. 115 1617 1624 . Following a 10 minute incubation on ice, the bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation in an Eppendorf centrifuge BrinkmanInstruments, Inc., Westbury, NY and the pellets were washed consecutively in IP buffer, IP buffer containing 0.5 M LiC1, and finally IP buffer. The pellets were resuspended in SDSPAGE sample buffer 70 mM Tris HCl, pH 6.8, 11 glycerol, 3 SDS, 5 ss ME, 0.01 bromophenol blue Laemmli, 1970, Nature 227 680 5 . The extract was boiled for 2 minutes and centrifuged for 5 minutes in an Eppendorf centrifuge to remove insoluble material and loaded onto a 7 17 SDS PAGE gradient gel. Immunoprecipitated proteins were visualized by fluorography following treatment of the gel with 1 M sodium salicylate.Films were exposed overnight at 700C using odak XAR5 film and an intensifying screen. A number of 35S labeled proteins were found to be specifically precipitated by goat anti PRV serum as compared to normal goat serum. To identify which of these proteins were glycosylated and hence probably PRV virion envelope iproteins, the proteins in PRV infected cells were labeled using 3H glucosamine. Labeled proteins were identified by immunoprecipitation as described supra. The immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS PAGE and visualized by fluorography. The goat anti PRV sera Bspecifically precipitated at least five glycoproteins. The molecular weights of these PRV specific glycoproteins were estimated to be 110,000, 92,000, 74,000, 55,000 and 22,q00 and were designated according to their electrophoretic mobility i.e., 9110, g92, g74, g55, g22 . 6.5. PRODUCTION OF RABBIT ANTISERA AGAINST PRV GLYCOPROTEINS PRV glycoproteins identified by 3H glucosamine labeling were enriched by preparative affinity chromatography of infected cell extracts and separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Regions corresponding to major groups of glycoproteins were excised from the gel and used to immunize rabbits. A requirement of the cloning expression strategy utilized in this invention was that antibodies raised againstPRV glycoproteins recognize linear or denatured determinants.Therefore, antibodies were raised against PRV glycoproteins denatured with heat and SDS, as described in the following sections. 6.5.1. PREPARATION OF GOAT ANTI PRV ANTIBODY AFFINITY COLUMN Immunoglobulin from 5 mt of goat anti PRV serum was purified using two ammonium sulphate precipitations followed by extensive dialysis against phosphate buffered saline PBS, 40 mM NaP04, pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl . Resultant immunoglobulins were covalently bound to 3 mt of Affigel 10 resin Bio Rad,Richmond, CA at 40C for 2 hours. The affigel was then incubated in 0.1 M ethanolamine at room temperature for 1 hour and subsequently washed with 4 column volumes of IP buffer followed by IP buffer containing 1 M NaCl and IP buffer containing 1.5 M potassium thiocyanate. The column was stored in IP buffer containing 0.02 azide at 40C.6.5.2. PURIFICATION OF PRV SPECIFIC PROTEINS Three roller bottles of PK15 cells were infected with 0.1 pfu cell of PRV and were incubated for 36 hours at 370C.The cells were then scraped into 20 ml of IP buffer, sonicated briefly and cebtrifuged in an SW41 Beckman rotor Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA for 30 minutes at 40,000 rpm at 40C. The supernatant was incubated for 60 minutes at 40C with the goat anti PRV antibody affinity resin. The resin was then washed under stringent conditions with 4 resin volumes each of IP buffer, IP buffer containg 1K NaCl and then reequilibrated in IP buffer. The antibody affinity resin was poured into a glass column and proteins were eluted with IP buffer containing 1.5 M potassium thiocyanate and 1 NP40. The appropriate fractions containing PRV specific proteins were pooled and the proteins precipitated using 10 trichloracetic acid TCA . Precipitates were spun in anEppendorf centrifuge for 15 minutes at 40C. Protein samples selected by binding to the goat anti PRV antibody column were lyophilized and resuspended in SDS PAGE sample buffer and applied to a 10 SDS PAGE gel.Electrophoresis was carried out for 3.5 hours at 40 mA. Side strips of the gel containing marker proteins were cut from the gel and stained using Coomassie blue dye. The stained side strips were used to locate PRV proteins in the remainder of the unstained gel. Regions of the gel containing the major groups of PRV glycoproteins i.e., gilO and g92, 974, g55 and g22 were excised and macerated. New Zealand white rabbits were inoculated subcutaneously with polyacrylamide gel slices containing approximately 30 pg of PRV protein emulsified in Freund s adjuvant. For each of the four groups of PRV specific glycoproteins, rabbits received five inoculations only the initial inoculation was in complete Freund s adjuvant, whereas the remainder were inFreund s incomplete adjuvant. Serum from all rabbits was obtained prior to inoculation and subsequently five days after each boost by bleeding from the marginal ear vein.Rabbit sera were analyzed by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. An example of such an analysis is described below for rabbit sera directed against PRV 974 protein. 6.5.3. IMMUNOPRECIPITATION AND WESTERN BLOT ANALYSIS OF PRV SPECIFIC PROTEINS The specificity and reactivity of the resulting rabbit sera immunized with PRV g74 protein was assessed by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. PRV infected PK15 cells were labeled with 35S methionine and cell extracts prepared as described supra were reacted with either normal rabbit serum or rabbit serum raised against the PRV g74 protein. Immune complexes were collected by adsorbtion to Staphylococcus aureus and subjected to electrophoresis on a 7 17 SDS PAGE gel. 35S labeled proteins were detected by fluorography. The predominant PRV protein precipitated using anti PRV g74 serum was a protein of 74,000 apparent molecular weight, although other PRV proteins were detected to a greatly reduced extent. For Western blot analysis, uninfected and PRV infectedPK15 cell lysates were subjected to electrophoresis on a 717 gradient SDS PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose according to the method of Towbin et al. 1979, Proc. Natl.Acad. Sci. USA 76 4350 4 . After transfer, the filter was incubated at 370C for 2 hours in a solution of 5 BSA bovine serum albumin in binding buffer 0.1 M NaCl, 0.01 M NaPO4, pH 7.5 to saturate all available protein binding sites i.e. blocking buffer .The immobilized proteins were then reacted with anti PRV 974 serum prepared in the blocking buffer described above.Reactions were performed in sealed plastic bags at 40C for 12 18 hours on a rotary shaker. Following this incubation, the filter was washed three times for 20 minutes at room temperature in binding buffer. The second wash contained 0.5M NaCl and 0.05 Nonidet P 40 and the third wash contained 0.05 Nonidet P 40. To visualize antigen antibody interactions, the nitrocellulose was then incubated with 125, labeled goat anti rabbit IgG antibodies. The second antibody was iodinated using Bio Rad enzymobeads Richmond,CA and 125I from New England Nuclear Boston, MA according to the recommended conditions. The reaction with the iodinated antibody was carried out at 40C for 4 hours in the blocking buffer.The nitrocellulose was washed as described supra followed by autoradiography at 700C using Kodak XAR5 film with an intensifying screen. Antiserum raised againstPRV g74 protein reacted with PRV specific proteins of 74,000, 76,000, 92,000, and 98,000 apparent molecular weight. The results indicated that anti PRV g74 serum was not monospecific and that the method used for isolation of PRV glycoproteins probably resulted in co purification of PRVspecific proteins of similar molecular weights i.e. 74,000 an 76,000 . In addition the methods used in immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis to determine the specificity of the sera were not analogous.Immunoprecipitation involved the reaction of antibodies with undenatured proteins, whereas the Western blot analysis involved the reaction of antibodies with denatured proteins. Furthermore, the method of raising antibodies involved inoculation with denatured PRV proteins and therefore the antisera produced may react preferentially in the Western blot analysis. Antisera raised in rabbits against the combined 9110 and g92 proteins reacted in immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis predominantly with proteins of 110,000, 92,000 and 55,000 apparent molecular weight. Antisera against proteins contained in gel slices including the PRV g55 and g22 proteins have not been produced yet in sufficient titer in rabbits. 6.6. CLONING OF PRV DNA INTO AN EXPRESSION VECTOR A library of E. coli plasmid bearing strains each expressing PRV DNA sequences was constructed by insertion of random segments of PRV DNA into an E. coli expression plasmid vector. Expression plasmids producing PRV antigens as proteins fused to ss galactosidase that reacted with rabbit anti g74 sera described supra were identified. 6.6.1. THE EXPRESSION VECTORS pJS413 AND pHK412 The expression vectors pJS413 6483 bp or about 6.5 kilobases, kb and pHK412 6485 bp or about 6.5 kb , are pBR322 derivatives which contain the ampr ss lactamase gene, a lac promoter plac , lac and Cro ribosome binding sites SDlacz and SDCr are represented in figures as SDZ andSDCro, respectively , a chain initiation ATG derived from Cro followed by 65 nucleotides of the Cro gene, and a modified ss galactosidase gene the i z gene, hereinafter referred to as the z gene . These expression vectors are described in detail in a U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 449,187 to J. Salstrom et al., filed December 13, 1982 which is incorporated herein by reference. Each plasmid has unique cloning sites which span the Cro z junction the pJS413 cloning sites are by II, SmaI, and BamHI the pHK412 cloning sites are by II, HindIII, Smal, and BamHI. In plasmid pJS413, the z gene is not in phase with the Cro ATG, thus, the intact plasmid does not direct the production of ss galactosidase.However, when a DNA fragment is inserted in the correct orientation and reading frame into these cloning sites on the plasmid, the reading frame of the z gene may be readjusted with respect to the Cro ATG and, provided that the inserted DNA sequence contains no termination signals e.g.,TGA, TAA, or TAG that are in phase with the Cro ATG or z gene, a PRV ss galactosidase fusion protein having ss galactosidase activity will be produced by host cells transformed by such recombinant plasmids. The ss galactosidase activity can be aserted by color reaction on indicator plates. Accordingly, insertion of a 3n l b.p.DNA fragment between the Cro ATG and z gene of pJS413, results in a readjustment of the reading frames and production of a fusion protein in the host cell transformant, provided the inserted sequences do not contain termination signals in the same reading frame. Of course, the inserted DNA sequence and or the cloning sites of pJS413 and pHK412 may be altered in any fashion in order to readjust the reading frame across the Cro z junction. 6.6.2. CLONING OF RANDOM PRV DNA FRAGMENTS The plasmid expression library was constructed by first fragmenting PRV DNA isolated from purified nucleocapsids using limited digestion with pancreatic deoxyribonuclease I in the presence of Mn 2 ions. Briefly, 10 9 of PRV DNA isolated from purified nucleocapsids as described in Sections 6.2 and 6.3 was digested with 2ng DNaseI for 10, 20 and 30 minutes at 250C. The digests were pooled and run on a 5 polyacrylamide gel. A. region corresponding to 0.5 0.6 kb DNA was excised, and the DNA fragments were eluted and ethanol precipitated. The ends of the PRV DNA fragments were repaired using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and all four deoxynucleotides. 32p labeled DNA linkers, GGAGATCTCC , which contained the BglII recognition sequence were added to the PRV fragments using T4 DNA ligase. The complementary strands of DNA linker were synthesized by the solid phase method of Chow et al. 1981, Nucleic Acids Res. 9 12 28072827 . After addition of the BglII linkers, the DNA was digested with BglII and run on a 5 polyacrylamide gel. PRVDNA with the BglII linkers attached were located by autoradiography, excised from the gel, eluted and ethanol precipitated. Subsequently the PRV DNA was ligated into the BgllI site of the expression vector pJS413 Weis et al., 1983, Nature 302 72 74 . 6.6.3. IDENTIFICATION OF TRANSFORMANTS Plasmid DNA resulting from the ligation of the 500 600 bp random PRV DNA fragments to the BglII site of pJS413 were used to transform competent E. coli strain NF1829. The E.coli strain NF1829 is a K 12 MCl1000 derivative carrying anF lac episome with the lacIq mutation for lac repressor overproduction. The lac z gene encoding ss galactosidase present on the F lac episome is inactivated by a Tn5 ttransposonj insertion. Thus, in strain NF1829, the lac promoter must be induced in order to obtain expression of a gene inserted into the pJS413 plasmid. Primary transformants were detected on L broth agar plates containing ampicillin. Transformants were replicaplated on lactose MacConkey Mac Lac agar plates using nitrocellulose filters. Specific transcription from the pJS413 lac promoter was induced by the lactose in Mac Lac plates, and the ss galactosidase activity of the hybrid gene products was assessed by colony color. Red color on Mac Lac plates indicated ss galactosidase activity as a result of insertion of a PRV DNA fragment into pJS413 in the correct translational reading frame. Single colonies were picked for further analysis from the duplicate L broth agar plates and screened for the bacterial synthesis of PRV antigens. 6.6.4. SCREENING FOR BACTERIAL SYNTHESIS OF PRV ANTIGENS USING WESTERN BLOT ANALYSIS Transformants were picked and grown overnight stationary phase at 300C in L broth containing 100 vg mQ ampicillin. To obtain synthesis of fusion proteins, 50 pQ of each overnight culture was used to inoculate 1 mt fresh Lbroth containing 100 vg mQ ampicillin. After incubation at 380C for 90 minutes, the cultures were induced by the addition of IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mM in the growth medium. After further incubation at 380C for 1 hour, bacteria were collected by centrifugation and lysed by boiling in 200 t of SDS PAGE sample buffer described supra. In all, the proteins specified by 278 independent transformants were screened by Western blot analysis.Proteins were resolved by electrophoresis and analyzed by theWestern blot procedure as described in Section 6.5.3. After immobilization of proteins on nitrocellulose paper, Cro PRV ss galactosidase proteins were reacted with rabbit anti PRV 974 serum. As a control, duplicate blots of proteins were reacted with normal rabbit serum. Binding of rabbit antibodies was detected by reaction with 125I labelled goat anti rabbit IgG antibodies and autoradiography. Of the 278 colonies screened, 118 were found to synthesize a fusion protein of a size predicted for a PRV DNA insert of approximately 500 600 bp. Two of these fusion proteins were found to react specifically with anti PRV g74 serum.The plasmids contained by these positive clones were designated pDPR7 and pDPR123. The remaining 160 colonies either synthesized a smaller protein of the size of ss galactosidase or synthesized no visible inducible protein. 6.6.5. MAPPING OF pDPR7 AND pDPR123 DNA ON THE PRV GENOME The PRV DNA inserts contained by the two plasmids pDPR7 and pDPR123 that specified fusion proteins reactive with anti PRV g74 serum, were mapped on the PRV genome using theSouthern blot hybridization method. Restriction enzyme analysis of plasmid DNA from clones pDPR7 and pDPR123 indicated that the PRV DNA inserted in pJS413 was approximately 450 bp and 370 bp in size respectively. Each plasmid DNA was isolated and purified as described in Section 6.1.1. and labeled with 32P by nick translation Rigby et al., 1977, J. Mol. Biol. 113 237 51 . Genomic PRV DNA was digested separately with restriction enzymes BamHI, KpnI, PstI and PvuII and duplicate sets of the fragments were resolved by electrophoresis through a 0.78 agarose gel. DNA fragments were transferred to nitrocellulose by the method of Southern 1975, J. Mol. Biol.98 503 517 . The denatured, labeled plasmid DNA of pDPR7 and pDPR123 were then hybridized to the PRV genomic DNA restriction fragments immobilized on the nitrocellulose.Figure 1 shows a restriction map of PRV DNA for the enzymes BamHI and KpnI which was derived by Lad in et al. 1982, Virology 116 544 561 . The PRV DNA segments carried by both pDPR7 and pDPR123 hybridized to the BamHI 2 fragment of PRV DNA as indicated in Figure 1. The hybridization studies indicated that pDPR123 DNA hybridized to the KpnI J fragment of PRV DNA which is adjacent to, and slightly overlaps the BamHI 2 fragment. Plasmid pDPR7 mapped wholly within the KpnI A fragment which is adjacent to KpnI J.These data suggested that the plasmids contained PRV DNA inserts that were non overlapping but adjacent on the PRV DNA genome. Further sub cloning of the PRV DNA genome allowed localization of the area of hybridization of pDPR7 and pDPR123 to a single 3.6 kb SphI NcoI fragment of PRV genomicDNA. The PRV DNA inserts contained in pDPR7 and pDPR123 were found to map within approximately 100 bp from each other. By producing antibodies to the Cro PRV ss galactosidase fusion proteins expressed by pDPR7 and pDPR123, the cloned PRV segments were determined to represent different regions of the same gene. Additionally, DNA sequencing indicated that the pDPR and pDPR123 inserts formed parts of a continuous open reading frame. 6.6.6. PRODUCTION AND ANALYSIS OF ANTISERA RAISED AGAINST Cro PRV ss GALACTOSIDASE FUSION PROTEINS EXPRESSED BY PLASMIDS pDPR7 AND pDPR123 Cro PRV ss galactosidase fusion proteins were purified from extracts of IPTG induced cultures of pDPR7 and pDPR123 transformants by the aggregate procedure described in Section 5.5 and SDS PAGE electrophoresis was carried out for 3.5 hours at 40 mA as described in Section 6.5.2. Briefly, regions containing the fusion proteins were excised from the gel, and emulsified in Freund s adjuvant and injected intoNew Zealand white rabbits.Rabbits were inoculated subcutaneously with polyacrylamide gel slices containing approximately 50 ag of PRV fusion protein and the sera were analyzed by Western blot techniques and immunoprecipitation. Uninfected or PRV infected PK15 cell proteins were subjected to electrophoresis on a 7 17 SDS PAGE gel and subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose. The immobilized proteins were then reacted with serum raised against pDPR7 and pDPR123 fusion proteins and in duplicate with pre immune serum. Binding of antibodies to proteins was detected by reaction with 1251 labeled goat anti rabbit IgG antibodies and autoradiography. Rabbit anti sera raised against either fusion protein were found to react with two PRV specific proteins of apparent molecular weights 74,000 and 92,000.Serum taken from rabbits prior to inoculation with these fusion proteins did not react with any PRV specific proteins. Goat anti PRV serum was used as a control in this experiment and 1251 rabbit anti goat IgG was used as the second antibody. This Western blot analysis revealed PRV specific proteins ranging in apparent molecular weights from 32,000 to 115,000 including proteins of 74,000 and 92,000 apparent molecular weight. To immunoprecipitate PRV specific proteins using antiserum raised against either pDPR7 or pDPR123 fusion proteins, it was necessary to more fully denature the PRV proteins. H glucosamine labeled PRV infected cell extracts were lysed in 1 mt of IP buffer, and centrifuged at 40,000 rpm in a Beckman SW41 rotor for 30 minutes at 40C. The concentration of SDS and dithiothreitol in the supernatant was adjusted to 0.5 and 10 mM respectively. The extract was then boiled for 2 minutes and diluted five fold with IP buffer. Antisera were then added as described in Section 6.5.3 and immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS PAGE. Rabbit antisera raised against pDPR7 and pDPR123 fusion proteins immunoprecipitated PRV specific glycoproteins with apparent molecular weights of 74,000 and 92,000 g74 and g92 . The 74,000 molecular weight glycoprotein band appeared sharp, whereas the 92,000 molecular weight glycoprotein band appeared diffuse in both immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. Antibodies raised against both pDPR7 and pDPR123 fusion proteins reacted identically in Western blot analysis and under modified immmunoprecipitation conditions.Apparently, antibodies raised against both the pDPR7 and pDPR123 fusion proteins from denatured, purified gel slices recognized the g74 and g92 glycoproteins only when the antigen was first denatured. Moreover, these antisera did not neutralize PRV infectivity in vitro. The results of these experiments with antisera raised in rabbits against pDPR7 and pDPR123 fusion proteins indicated that the PRV DNA segments cloned in each plasmid represented coding sequences from the same gene. 6.6.7. INSERTION OF BamHI 2 FRAGMENT OR PRV GENOMIC DNA INTO pBR322 As described in section 6.6.5, the PRV DNA inserts of pDPR7 and pDPR123 were mapped to the 20.3 kb BamHI 2 fragment of PRV DNA. This 20.3 kb BamHI 2 fragment was inserted in pBR322 See Fig. 2 . PRV genomic DNA 10 ug was digested with BamHI and the BamHI 2 fragment was isolated following electrophoresis on a LMP agarose gel. 500 ng of the BamHI 2 fragment of PRV genomic DNA and 100 ng of pBR322 digested with BamHI 4.3 kb were annealed and ligated and used to transform E. coli strain MC1000. Transformants were isolated and plasmid DNA was prepared by the mini lysate method described in Section 6.1.1. Plasmid pPRV49 was determined to contain the desired fragment See Fig. 2 . Further analysis of PRV DNA sequences represented in pDPR7 and pDPR123 more precisely located these sequences to an approximately 2.5 kb SphI BamHI fragment contained within pPRV49. This fragment was cloned in the ssphI BamHI sites of pBR322 and used to analyse the gene represented by pDPR7 and pDPR123 by subsequent DNA sequencing and S1 and ExonucleaseVII analysis. The 2.5 kb PRV SphI BamHI DNA fragment from plasmid pPRV49 was isolated on a LMP agarose gel, annealed and ligated to the BamHI SphI sites of pBR322 See Fig. 2 . TheDNA was used to transform E. coli MC1000. Transformants were selected on Lob agar plates containing 100 llg mQ ampicillin.Plasmid DNA prepared by the mini lysate method was screened by restriction analysis for the desired plasmid and clone p7 123 was selected. Restriction analysis of p7 123 was performed and a restriction map was constructed as shown inFig. 1. The PRV glycoprotein encoded by DNA sequences represented in this plasmid is designated gIII previously referred to in U.S. Pat. Ser. No. 598,073 as g74 g92 . The nomenclature used to describe the structural glycoproteins ofPRV has been revised according to the classification Hampl et al. 1984, J. Virol. 52 583 590 to be consistent with the terminology used in this field of research. 6.6.8. LOCALIZATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF THE PRV gIII GENE mRNA CODING SEQUENCE To characterize the PRV gIII glycoprotein gene transcript, mRNA was isolated from PRV infected cells and hybridized to labeled probes using the Northern blot technique. The size of the mRNA coding for this glycoprotein gene was determined by extracting total cytoplasmic RNA from cells infected with PRV at different times after infection, and aNorthern blot analysis was carried out using nick translatedDNA from pDPR7 and pDPR123 as probes. RNA samples approximately 5 g of different sizes were electrophoresed through agarose gels containing formaldehyde and transferred to nitrocellulose filters Maniatis et al., Molecular Cloning, 1982, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory pp 202 203 .Hybridization of both probes independently to a specific cytoplasmic RNA was detected the approximate size of the RNA was 1600 bp. The translation of such an RNA could give rise to a polypeptide of maximal molecular weight 58,000. Mapping the genomic DNA transcribed into the 1.6 kb mRNA sequence was accomplished by nuclease analysis, i.e., using single strand specific nucleases S1 and Exonuclease VII to map the regions of DNA probes that hybridized to complementary mRNA sequences Berk and Sharp, 1978, Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 75 1274 , and by sequencing the DNA of the PRV gIII gene Maxam and Gilbert, 1980, Methods inEnzymology 651499 . The principle of the S1 mapping technique is to allow duplex formation between RNA and a radiolabeled single stranded DNA ssDNA probe e.g., obtained from p7 123 . If the RNA is a mature spliced mRNA, the introns will form a ssDNA loop. The enzyme nuclease S1 digests all ssDNA regions of the radiolabeled DNA that are not protected by duplex formation with RNA, whereas Exonuclease VII digests ssDNA only at the termini and therefore will not digest the ssDNA loops. Comparison of the size of DNA not susceptible to nucleases by virtue of hybridization to RNA enables the localization of the 5 end of the gene and the detection of spliced mRNA transcripts. By using appropriate 5 and 3 labeled DNA probes, this method also allows the 5 and 3 boundaries of the transcribed regions of genes to be precisely defined. In the present invention, to ascertain more precisely the location of the 5 end of the PRV gene represented by pDPR7 and pDPR123, DNA from plasmid p7 123 was digested with restriction enzymes BamHI or SmaI and labeled with 32P on either the 5 or 3 termini. Labeled DNA was digested withSphI and subsequently the appropriate DNA fragments were purified by gel electrophoresis for use in an S1 andExonuclease VII analysis using total cytoplasmic RNA from PRV infected cells. It should be noted that this procedure resulted in the generation of DNA fragments uniquely labeled at either the BamHI or SmaI terminus. Using this technique, the 5 end of the gene was located approximately 1500 bp from the BamHI site in p7 123 as shown in Figure 1. As previously described, the size of the mRNA coding for the gene represented by pDPR7 and pDPR123 is approximately 1600 bp. The S1 mapping data indicated that the 3 end of the gene is located outside the SphI BamHI fragment of p7 123 towards the BamHI site See Fig. 1 .Exonuclease VII digests performed on the DNA RNA hybrids using the labeled DNA plasmid probes indicated no splicing of the 1.6 kb mRNA transcribed from this PRV gene. Finally, the PRV glycoprotein gene of p7 123 was sequenced using the method of Maxam and Gilbert Maxam andGilbert, 1980, Methods in Enzymology 65 499 . Both the coding and non coding strands were sequenced. Figure 3 represents the DNA sequence obtained for the PRV gIII gene.The DNA sequence data established that there was an open reading frame of approximately 1350 base pairs located downstream from an ATG at position 199. Sequence data upstream from this ATG indicated the presence of the sequences CATTAAATC residues 112 to 120 and TTTTTAAAA residues 151 to 159 which may correspond to transcriptional regulatory CAT and TATA signals, respectively See Fig. 3 . To complete the DNA sequence and fine structure analyses of the PRV gIII gene, the 3 end of the glycoprotein gene which is located on the KPnI J fragment See Fig. 1 of PRV genomic DNA and overlaps the BamHI 2 fragment, was first cloned in the vector Polink 26. To construct Polink 26 a synthetic 65 bp DNA fragment containing multiple restriction endonuclease cleavage sites was used to replace the 1850 bp fragment between the EcoRI and SalI site in pBR328 Bethesda Research Laboratories,Gaithersburg, MD . An approximately 3100 bp fragment was isolated on LMP agarose and ligated to the synthetic 65 bp DNA fragment. The construction of the Polink 26 vector is described in Fig. 4. PRV genomic DNA and Polink 26 DNA were digested with gpnI and Polink 26 was subsequently treated with bacterial alkaline phosphatase BAP to minimize recircularization of plasmid DNA. The Kp I J fragment of PRV genomic DNA and the linearized Polink 26 DNA fragments were isolated from a 1 LMP agarose gel, ligated and used to transform E. coli MC1000. Transformants were isolated and plasmid DNA prepared by the mini lysate method and screened by Southern blot analysis using nick translated pDPR123 DNA as a probe.Plasmid pK64 which contained the correct KpnI J fragment ofPRV genomic DNA was isolated See Fig. 4 . DNA sequence and S1 analysis of this clone located the 3 end of the gene approximately 70 bp from the BamHI site in p7 123. Amino acid comparison between the PRV gIII gene and the HSV 1 gC showed limited but significant homology as indicated in Fig. 3. Similarity alignments between the PRV and HSV 1 proteins were determined using the PROTHOM program of Conrad and Mount as described in Figure 4. The programs were used to locate regions of local sequence similarity in the coding regions ofPRV DNA. The programs also substantiated proof that heterologous DNA gene sequences could be used for the localization and identification of yet unmapped herpesvirus genes. This analysis indicated an approximately 28.5 identity of the two sequences for the 467 amino acid sequence compared. 6.6.9. CLONING AND EXPRESSION OF THE PRV gIll GENE REPRESENTED BY p7 123 DNA sequence analysis of p7 123, pDPR7 and pDPR123 enabled the translational phasing of the PRV gIII gene represented in p7 123 to be established. Insertion of approximately 96 of the gill gene coding sequences NcoI to BamHI of plasmid p7 123 in the correct reading frame between the cro initiation ATG of pHK412 and the z gene i.e., within the BglII, HlndIII, Smal or BamHI cloning sites in PHK412 allowed for the synthesis of a PRV ss galactosidase fusion protein containing gIIf amino acid sequences in cells transformed with this recombinant plasm id. Plasmid pHK412 was digested with SmaI resulting in a blunt ended cleaved vector and BamHI generating a BamHI cohesive end . The 6.5 kb fragment, containing the promoter, SD sequence, partial cro sequence, initiation ATG and the ss galactosidase gene was isolated by gel electrophoresis. Plasmid p7 123 was digested with NcoI and cohesive ends were filled in using the DNA polymerase Klenow fragment resulting in a blunt end . After digestion withBamHI, and purification on LMP agarose, the 1400 bp DNA PRV fragment and the 6.5 kb pHK412 fragment were mixed in a 5 1 molar ratio, annealed and ligated, using T4 DNA ligase Fig.6 . The resultant recombinant plasmids were used to transform E. coli strain NF1829. As previously described, the E. coli strain NF1829 is an overproducer of the lac repressor, hence the lac promoter was transcriptionally silent and must be induced by IPTG or a suitable analog to obtain expression of a gene inserted into the pHK412 plasmid. 6.6.10. IDENTIFICATION AND ANALYSIS OF TRANSFORMANTS THAT EXPRESS THE PRV gIII GENE Transformants were screened by restriction analysis for insertion of the 1.4 kb NcoI to BamHI restriction enzyme fragment of p7 123 DNA after preparation of DNA by the mini lysate method. A clone designated pNB412 was isolated that contained the correct PRV DNA insert. To determine if pNB412 transformants were capable of synthesizing PRV ss galactosidase fusion protein, total cell lysates induced with IPTG were analyzed by SDS PAGE followed by Coomassie brilliant blue staining. The bacteria synthesized a high molecular weight polypeptide upon induction of the lac promoter. The PRV B galactosidase fusion protein was of the size predicted for a fusion protein based upon data relating to the size of the insertedPRV DNA sequences and the z gene. A low level of fusion protein was produced less than 1 of total cellular E. coli protein by pNB4l2 transformants. In order to increase the level of fusion protein production, the ptac promoter was introduced into pNB412. 6.7. CONSTRUCTION OF ptac CLONES Various tac i.e., trp lac promoter operator region clones were constructed. The hybrid promoter was constructed by combining the 35 bp region and the 10 bp region the sequences which are the RNA polymerase binding site of the E. coli trp and the lac promoters. SeeEuropean Patent Application 67,540 to DeBoer, filed May 18, 1982 . 6.7.1. CONSTRUCTION OF ptacNB The expression vector p830 contains the strong tac trp lac promoter. Plasmid p830 also contains cro sequences ligated to the tac promoter and parvovirus sequences and is described in detail in U.S. Pat.Application, Ser. No. 564,567 to Halling et al., filedDecember 22, 1983. This plasmid was digested with PstI andBglII and a 1300 bp fragment was isolated on LMP agarose.Plasmid pNB412 was also digested with PstI and BglII and a 6.8 kb fragment was isolated on LMP agarose. The 6.8 kb pNB412 fragment and the 1.3 kb p830 fragment were mixed in a 1 4 molar ratio, annealed and ligated using T4 DNA ligase See Fig. 7 . The ligation mixture was used to transformE. coli NF1829. Transformants were selected for ampicillin resistance and plasmid DNA was prepared using the alkaline mini lysate preparation described in Section 6.1.2. Plasmid DNA was screened by restriction endonuclease digestion with PstI and BqlII to identify a plasmid containing the DNA sequences of the tac promoter. One clone, designated ptacNB was selected and examined for production of fusion protein by analysis of total E. coli proteins from cells harboring this expression plasmid as described supra. The fusion protein was produced at approximately 5 108 of total cellular E. coli protein as determined by Coomassie brilliant blue staining of SDS PAGE gels containing total cell lysates of transformants induced with IPTG. 6.7.2. WESTERN BLOT ANALYSIS OF THE Cro PRV gIII S GALACTOSIDASE FUSION PROTEIN EXPRESSED BY ptacNB The fusion protein produced by ptacNB specifically interacted with goat anti PRV protein and rabbit serum directed against PRV g74 protein. The fusion protein expressed by ptacNB in the IPTG induced cells was separated by SDS PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blot analysis as described supra. The nitrocellulose was treated with goat anti PRV serum or rabbit anti PRV g74 125 serum followed by the appropriate 125I labeled second antibody. Autoradiographs of the protein blots clearly demonstrated that goat anti PRV serum or rabbit anti PRV g74 serum reacted strongly with the fusion protein expressed by ptacNB and not with other ss galactosidase fusion proteins containing unrelated virus protein sequences. 6.7.3. CLONING AND EXPRESSION OF THE PRV gIII GENE WITH ITS NATURAL TERMINATOR Plasmid pNT7 123 was constructed to contain PRV gIll gene sequences and the natural terminator signal sequenceTGA for the gene see Fig. 8 . Plasmid ptacNB was partially digested with NcoI and then digested to completion withXhoI. An approximately 4.8 kb NcoI XhoI DNA fragment that contained an intact NcoI site at the ATG for the gIll gene and in which the ss galactosidase gene was deleted was isolated and purified in LMP agarose. Plasmid pK64 was digested with XhoI and NcoI and an approximately 1100 bp fragment which contained the natural TGA termination sequence for the gene was isolated in LMP agarose.The two fragments were ligated and the ligation mixture was used to transform E. coli NF1829. Plasmid DNA was prepared using the mini lysate method described supra. DNA was screened by restriction endonuclease digestion with HindIII and XhoI or NcoI andXhoI to identify a plasmid containing the correct insert.One clone, pNT7 123 with the correct insertion was selected.This clone was examined for production of PRV protein. Plasmid pNT7 123 transformants induced with IPTG synthesized no detectable levels of Cro PRV fusion protein.This plasmid contains the natural terminator sequence and a sequence which may be analogous to the transmembrane sequence found in other Herpes Simplex Virus glycoprotein genes. The fact that no detectable levels of inducible protein were observed may be due to the presence of these transmembrane sequences as is the case with the expression of HSV 1 gD protein in E. coli See U.S.Pat. Appln. Atty.Dock. No. 2697 046, filed February 29, 1985 to Watson et al. It should also be noted that some E. coli proteins would migrate in a protein gel in a position similar to that expected for the Cro PRV hybrid protein and may therefore obscure the detection of the Cro PRV protein. 6.7.4. CONSTRUCTION OF p7 123AM WHICH PRODUCED BOTH Cro PRV gill FUSION PROTEIN AND Cro PRV gIll ss GALACTOSIDASE FUSION PROTEIN Recombinant plasmids were constructed that can direct the production of both Cro PRV gIII and Cro PRV gIII ss galactosidase fusion proteins in appropriate host cells. For example, as described below, if the recombinant plasmid ptacNB was cleaved at the junction of the PRV gene sequence and the Z gene sequence and subsequently ligated in the presence of an appropriate DNA linker sequence containing an amber codon termination sequence, TAG, the resultant tecombinant plasmids would contain an amber codon termination sequence in phase with the translational reading frames of both the PRV gene and Z gene. Plasmid ptacNB DNA was digested with BamHI resulting in cleavage of the plasmid at its unique restriction endonuclease site located at the junction of between the PRV gene and the Z gene. The cleaved plasmid was re ligated using T4 DNA ligase in the presence of a DNA linker characterized by an XbaI site and an amber sequence, TAG EMI83.1 tb SEP XbaI tb GATCTAGATCTA tb SEP ATCTAGATCTAG tb Each complementary strand of the DNA linker was synthesized by the solid phase method reported by Chow et al. 1981,Nucleic Acids Res. 9 12 2807 17. Introduction of the linker sequence destroyed the BamHI site but introduced a BglII and XbaI site and two amber codons. As a result of the ligation, the two amber sequences were in phase with the translational reading frame of the PRV gIII gene and the Z gene. The resulting plasmid was designated p7 123AM. 6.7.5. p7 123AM TRANSFORMANTS Plasmid p7 123AM was used to transform E. coli NF1829.When induced with IPTG, the ampicillin resistant transformants synthesized an approximately 60,000 daltonCro PRV gIII fusion protein as analyzed using the miniaggregate procedure. The following mini aggregate procedure was used to isolate host cell aggregates for screening analysis 1 Duplicate culture tubes containing 5 mt of fresh Luria broth containing 100 vg mt ampicillin were inoculated with 200 it of cells obtained from an overnight culture and grown for 90 minutes at 370C. One of each duplicate was induced by the addition of lmM IPTG final concentration .The inocula were then grown with shaking at 370C, and aliquots were taken at different time points post induction an described in 2 2 The cells contained in a 3 mt aliquot of the culture were pelleted by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge 12,000 x g for 2 minutes. N.B., the total volume of a microcentrifuge tube is 1.5 mt, therefore, a 1.5 mt aliquot was first pelleted and the supernatant was drawn off another 1.5 mt aliquot was added to the same microcentrifuge tube and pelleted in the same tube. 3 The cell pellet was resuspended in 50 i t of 25 sucrose containing 50mM Tris HCl, pH8, and the suspension was frozen by placing the tube in a dry ice ethanol bath. 4 The frozen suspension was thawed, 50 pQ of lOmg mt lysozyme in 0.25M Tris HCl pH8 was added, and the suspension was incubated for 10 to 15 minutes on ice. 5 After the 10 to 15 minute incubation 400 pQ ofTET buffer 100mM Tris HCl, pH8, 50mM EDTA, 2 Triton X 100 Triton X 100 is a non ionic detergent polyoxyethylene 910 tert octyl phenol was added, the suspension was gently mixed and incubated for 5 minutes on ice. Then 500 tit of 2xRIPA 2xRIPA is 20mM Tris HCl, pH7.4, 300mM NaCl, 2 sodium deoxycholate, 2 NP 40, 0.2 SDS was added and the suspension was mixed gently and incubated for 5 minutes on ice. 6 The cells in the suspension were then sonicated for 10 seconds using a microprobe, and the suspension was cleared by centrifugation in a Sorvall SS34 rotor for 10 minutes at 20,000 r.p.m. 47,800xg . 7 The supernatant was decanted and the pellet, which contains the aggregated proteins, was resuspended in 100 tit distilled H20 to which 90 pQ of 2x Sample Buffer 2xSample Buffer is composed of 10 SDS, 40mM Tris HCl, pH6.8, 2 B ME, and 0.02 volumes saturated solution of bromophenol blue and 10 p1 ss ME was added and mixed well. The mixture was boiled for 5 minutes and 25 pQ aliquots were applied to 108 SDS polyacrylamide gels for electrophoresis. The amber protein specified by the tac promoter operator construct was produced at approximately 3 of total cellularE. coli protein as determined by Coomassie brilliant blue staining of SDG PAGE gels. 6.7.6. INSERTION OF PRV DNA SEQUENCES INTO A HIGH COPY NUMBER PLASMID To enhance expression levels of the PRV gene modifications of plasmid p7 123AM were made using derivatives of the high copy number plasmid pOPlA6. This construction replaced ptac with plac and also replace the wild type colEl origin of replication with an ori mutation that causes plasmid over replication Fig. 9 . Plasmid p7 123AM was digested with EcoRI and the fragment encoding ptac and cro PRV ss galactosidase coding sequences was isolated. Plasmid pHV13 See, U.S. Pat.Appln. Attorney Docket No. 2697 046 to Watson et al., filedFebruary 27, 1985 which contains the ori mutation was digested with EcoRI and the DNA fragment containing the origin of replication and the amber gene was isolated. The two fragments were ligated using T4 DNA ligase and the resultant mixture used to transform E. coli NF1829. Plasmid p7 123AM ori was isolated from these transformed cells. Plasmid p7 123AM ori was then digested with HindIII and PstI and the DNA fragment encoding the PRV gill ss galactosidase sequences and the origin of replication of the plasmid were isolated. The expression vector pHK412 was also digested with PstI and Hindlil and the DNA fragment containing the plac promoter was isolated. The two fragments were ligated and used to transform E. coli NF1829.Ampicillin resistant colonies were selected, plasmid DNA isolated, and one plasmid pHK 7 123AM ori was selected for the presence of both the PRV insert and the high copy number phenotype. The PRV protein expressed by this plasmid was produced at the rate of approximately 3 of total cellularE. coli protein. 6.8. CONSTRUCTION OF RECOMBINANT VACCINIA VIRUSES Vaccinia virus expression vectors were used in the cloning and expression of the gIII gene sequences of PRV.Construction of recombinant vaccinia virus was achieved in two stages. First, a plasmid was constructed that contained the gIII gene of PRV located downstream from a vaccinia promoter the early 7.5 K promoter . Second, this chimeric gene containing the vaccinia promoter and the PRV gIII coding sequence was inserted into the genome of vaccinia virus by homologous recombination in vivo. 6.8.1. CONSTRUCTION OF AN E. COLI PLASMID CONTAINING THE VACCINIA PRV gIII RECOMBINANT GENE Five micrograms of pNT7 123 plasmid DNA was digested to completion with NcoI and the resulting fragments were resolved on a low melting point agarose gel see Fig. 10 .A 2.5 kb PRV specific fragment was isolated. This fragment contains the entire coding sequence of the PRV gIII gene and approximately 900 bp of the 3 non coding sequences. The initiation codon of the PRV gIII gene is believed to be encoded by the ATG sequence located in the 5 singlestranded region generated by the NcoI digested. This region was made double stranded by the action of Klenow enzyme in the presence of excess deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates. The resulting blunt ended fragment, was ligated to 0.5 ug of pGS20 MacKett et al., 1984, J. Virol. 49 857 864 DNA which was previously linearized with BamHI and made blunt ended with the Klenow enzyme. Ligation was allowed to proceed for 16 hours at 120C. The ligation mixture was then used to transform E. coli strain MC1000. Plasmid DNA from individual transformants was analyzed for the correct orientation of the PRV insert and the regeneration of theBamHI sites at the ligation junctions. The confirmed structure of the desired plasmid pGSPRl is shown in Fig.10. 6.8.2. CONSTRUCTION OF A RECOMBINANT VACCINIA VIRUS EXPRESSING THE PRV gIII GENE OF PRV Recombinant vaccinia viruses were generated by transfection of the pGSPRI plasmid into cells infected with vaccinia virus See Fig. 10 Insertion of the vaccinia PRV chimeric gene into vaccinia virus genome was achieved by in vivo recombination.This was made possible by the fact that the chimeric genes in plasmid pGSPRl was flanked by vaccinia sequences coding for the thymidine kinase TK gene. Introduction of this plasmid into vaccinia infected cells allows recombination to occur between the TK sequence on the plasmid and the homologous sequence in the viral gnome. Insertion of the chimeric gene will only occurr as the result of double recombinations in both of the flanking sequences. Such recombinants have the chimeric gene inserted in the vaccinia TK gene and, as a result, were phenotypically TK . These TK recombinants can therefore be selected for growth on TK host cells in medium supplemented with 5 bromo deoxyuridine BUdR .The general principle of this procedure has been described by MacKett et al. 1984, J. Virol. 49 857 864 . A 100 mm dish of 80 confluent African Green Monkey kidney cells strain B SC 40 supplied by Dr. R Condit,State University of New York, Buffalo, NY were infected with vaccinia virus strain WR at a low multiplicity 0.05 plaque forming units per cell . After 4 hours of incubation at 37 CC, infected cells were overlaid with a calcium phosphate precipitate of plasmid DNA pGSPRl.The precipitates were prepared by adding 0.5 mt of 2X DNA CaCl2 solution dropwise to 0.5 mt of 2X HeBS Hepes BufferedSaline solution. 2X DNA CaC12 solution contains 20 ug of plasmid DNA in 0.5 mt of 0.24 M CaC12. 2X HeBS contains per mt 16 mg of NaCl, 0.74 mg of KC1, 0.25 mg of Na2HP042H20, 2 mg of dextrose, and 10 mg of HEPES at pH 7.08. Precipitation was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 15 30 minutes. Four hours following the overlay of precipitates, the cells were washed once with 1X HeBS, incubated at 370C for 3 minutes in the presence of 2 mt 15 glycerol in 1X HeBS which was aspirated off the cells. The cell were washed once with 1X HeBS and then incubated with 10 mt of growth medium containing DME Dulbecco s Modified Eagles Medium,GIBCO and 10 FCS fetal calf serum, GIBCO . Two days later, infected cells were harvested and virus stock were prepared from these cells by 2 cycles of freezing and thawing, followed by sonication. Recombinants were selected by plating 0.1 mt of a 10 dilution of vaccinia viral stocks on 60 mm dishes of confluent human TK 143 cells supplied by Dr. R Condit overlaid with 1 agar DME 5 FCS. Individual plaques were picked and the virus suspensions used to infect humanTK 143 cells in 16 mm diameter wells under selective conditions. Recombinants were detected by DNA plaque hybridization. Infected cells were collected on nitrocellulose filters and the presence of PRV specific sequence in these samples was assayed by dot blot hybridization as described by MacKett et al. 1982, Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci., U.S.A. 79 7415 7419 . After denaturation, neutralization and fixation of the DNA, the DNA was hybridized with 32P labeled plasmid pNT7 123 DNA as probe.Recombinants that gave positive hybridization to this probe were further plaque purified twice on TK 143 cells under selective conditions and again on B SC 40 cells under nonselective conditions. After final confirmation by another wdot blott hybridization, viral stocks were prepared from the three times purified plaques on B SC 40 cells and used for characterization of recombinant virus, VPRI as described below. 6.8.3. ANALYSIS OF RECOMBINANT VPRI VIRUS High titer stocks of recombinant VPRI were grown onB SC 40 cells 2 x 109 pfu mQ . These virus stocks were used to infect PK15 cells at l0pfu cell. The infected cells were overlayed with 5mt DME, 5 FCS and 100pC mi 3H glucosamine Amersham . At 7 8 hours post infection, the cells were harvested and immunoprecipitations using cell lysates were carried out as described previously See Sec 6.4.1. . The results indicated that goat anti PRV serum, serum raised against the Cro PRV gIII protein expressed by p7 123AM and a monoclonal antibody against the PRV gIII gene all immunoprecipated a PRV specific glycoprotein of 92,000 apparent molecular weight.Pre immune or control sera did not immunoprecipitate any glycoproteins from VPRI infected all extracts. As a control PK15 cells were infected with wild type vaccinia virus and labeled with 3H glucosamine as described supra. Using wild type vaccinia infected cell extracts labeled with 3H glucosamine no immunoprecipitation of the PRV specific glycoproteins was observed using the same set of antibodies. The level of expression of the PRV gIII protein in cells infected with the recombinant virus VPRI is as yet unknown.Immunological experiments are now in progress to assess the ability of the recombinant virus VPRI to induce an immune response in mice and pigs capable of protecting them from a challenge with PRV. 6.9. USE OF HETEROLOGOUS DNA PROBES TO LOCALIZE GLYCOPROTEIN GENES WITHIN THE PRV GENOME Since Herpes simplex virus HSV and pseudorabies virus PRV have similar morphological and biochemical characteristics, and genomic DNA from HSV and PRV share homologous sequences an estimated 8 of the sequences of the genomes of HSV and PRV Ludwig et al., 1972, Virology 49 95 101 , it seemed likely that glycoprotein genes of these two viruses may be evolutionarily conserved and exhibit some sequence identity. Therefore, HSV DNA fragments containing glycoprotein genes were used to localize glycoprotein genes within the PRV genome. PRV genomic DNA was digested with a number of restriction enzymes and subjected to electrophoresis in a 0.7 agarose gel. DNA fragments were subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose filters according to the method of Southern. Cloned, nick translated DNA sequences corresponding toHSV 1 gB DeLuca et al., 1982, Virology 122 411 423 , HSV 1 gC Frink, 1981, J. Virology 39 559 572 and HSV 1 gD U.S.Pat. Application, Ser. No. 510,551 to Watson et al., filedJuly 6, 1983 were hybridized to restriction fragments ofPRV DNA fixed to nitrocellulose filters. The conditions for hybridization were as follows 50 formamide, 5X SSC 10XSSC 1.5 M NaCl, 0.15 M sodium citrate , l0mM PIPES 1,4Piperazinediethane Sulfonic Acid pH6.5, 5X Denhardt s lxDenhardt s 0.2 BSA, 0.02 Ficoll, 0.2 polyvinylpyrolidine solution, 200 tig mt calf thymus DNA and 106 cpm mt of the 32P labeled probe at 370C for 20 hours.Under these conditions, only specific hybridization ofHSV 1 gB DNA to PRV genomic DNA was observed. The region of hybridization was localized to a 9.5 kb SalI 3 fragment ofPRV genomic DNA See Fig. 11 . 200 ng of the SalI 3 fragment and 100 ng of pBR328 digested with SalI were annealed and ligated and used to transform E. coli My 1000 as described in Fig. 11. A clone, designated pPRS3 was isolated that contains the PRV SalI 3 DNA fragment. Further Southern blot analysis localized the region of hybridization of HSV 1 gB DNA to PRV DNA to a 3.4 kb SphI SalI fragment of plasmid pPRS3. Plasmid pPRS3 was partially digested with SphI and completely digested withSalI and the 3.4 kb fragment was isolated after electrophoresis through LMP agarose. 100 ng of the 3.4 kb fragment and 100 ng of pBR322 digested with SalI and SphI were annealed and ligated and used to transform E. coli NF 1829 See Fig. 11 . Clone pssgB was isolated and a restriction map of this plasmid was constructed See Fig.12 . The SphI site which should have been regenerated by ligation of the two SphI termini was lost during the cloning procedure. The size of the mRNA coding for this PRV glycoprotein gene was determined by Northern blot analysis as described in Section 6.6.8. Total cytoplasmic RNA was extracted from cells infected with PRV at different times after infection, and a Northern blot analysis was carried out using the 2.7 kb SphI SalI DNA fragment from pPRS3 purified from LMP agarose and subsequently nick translated. Hybridization of the nick translated probe to an RNA species of approximately 3000 bases was detected. The size of the mRNA encodingHSV 1 gB is estimated to be approximately 3000 bases. To determine the direction of transcription and the location of the 5 termini for this putative glycoprotein gene, S1 analysis was carried out as described in Section 6.6.8. Plasmid DNA from clone pssgB was digested with SalI orBstEII and labeled on either the 5 or 3 strand. The DNA was then digested with BamHI and subjected to electrophoresis in a 1 LMP agarose gel. DNA fragments of 3.4 kb BamHI SalI and 1.7 kb BamHI BstEII were purified from LMP agarose. S1 analysis indicated that the 5 end of the gene was located approximately 800 bp from the BstEII site 1400 on the restriction map towards the BamHI site in pssgB. The 3 end of the gene is most likely located external to the SalI 3 fragment. Another herpesvirus, bovine Herpes Virus I BHV I shares a homologous region of its genome with the HSV 1 gB gene and the PRV gene represented in plasmid pssgB. The homology between the BHV I and PRV homolog of the HSV 1 gB gene is greater than that for either BHV I or PRV with theHSV 1 gB gene. The BHV 1 homolog of the HSV 1 gB gene has been determined to encode for a family of related glycoproteins of 135,000, 75,000 and 54,000 apparent molecular weights, using monospecific serum raised against authentic glycoproteins of BHV 1. The monospecific sera was supplied by L. Babiuk, Saskatchewan, Canada . Indirect evidence as to the PRV specific glycoproteins encoded by the HSV 1 gB homolog of PRV was obtained using this monospecific sera to carry out immunoprecipitations using PRV infected cell lysates labeled with 3H glucosamine.This monospecific sera raised against authentic BHV 1 glycoproteins immunoprecipitated PRV specific glycoproteins of 110,000, 68,000 and 55,000 apparent molecular weights. Direct evidence indicating which PRV glycoproteins are encoded by the PRV homolog of the HSV 1 gB gene was obtained by using sera raised in rabbits against Cro PRV ss galactosi dase fusion protein expressed by the plasmid pXXgB See section 6.9.3 . Sera raised against this fusion protein immunoprecipitated PRV specific glycoproteins of 110,000, 68,000 and 55,000 apparent molecular weights from PRV infected cell extracts labeled with 3H glucosamine. TheHSV 1 gB homolog of PRV has thus been identified as the PRV gII glycoprotein gene complex Hampl et al. Lukacs et al., 1985, J. Virol. 53 166 173 . The PRV gII gene was sequenced using the method of Maxam and Gilbert. The entire PRV gII gene was cloned into pBamHI l i.e., the BamHI 1 fragment, as shown in Fig. 1 .Figure 13 represents most of the DNA sequences of the PRV gII gene. Similarity alignments between PRV and HSV 1 gB were also determined using the PROTHOM program and the PRTALN program as described supra and in Fig. 14. The programs were used to locate regions of local sequence similarity in the coding regions of PRV DNA and HSV 1 gB DNA and to confirm the specific DNA sequence of the PRV gII gene. This program indicated an approximately 49.2 identity for the 900 amino acids sequence compared. Cloning and expression of the PRV gII gene is described below. 6.9.1. CLONING OF THE PRV gII GENE REPRESENTED BY PLASMID pssqB A 1300 bp XhoI from plasmid pssgB fragment was inserted in the expression vector pHK4l2. 500 ng of pssgB DNA was digested with the restriction enzyme XhoI and subsequently incubated with all four dNTP s and the Klenow fragment ofDNA polymerase I. The DNA was then subjected to electrophoresis on a 1 LMP agarose gel, and the XhoI fragment of 1300 bp was excised from the gel.One p9 of the expression vector pHK412 was digested with the restriction enzyme SmaI and subsequently incubated with 0.6 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase CIAP, BoehringerMannheim Corp., Indianapolis, IN and 0.5mM ZnC12 at 370C for 30 minutes to dephosphorylate the DNA at the termini.The DNA was then incubated at 650C for 10 minutes and subjected to electrophoresis on a 1 LMP agarose gel. Linear DNA of approximately 6500 bp was excised from the gel. Approximately 50 ng of the XhoI 1300 bp fragment of pssgB and 100 ng of the 6500 bp fragment of pHK412 were ligated and transformed into E. coli NF1829. A clone, designated pssgB l was isolated which contained the 1300 bpXhoI DNA fragment of pssgB. Subsequent immunological analysis of the protein expressed by this clone and DNA sequence analysis See Fig.13 indicated that the PRV DNA in plasmid pssgB l was not in the correct reading frame to express the PRV gII gene. DNA sequence analysis had indicated the presence of two open reading frames in the 1300 bp XhoI restriction enzyme fragment represented in the plasmid pssgB in the pssgB gene insert. 6.9.2. CLONING AND EXPRESSION OF PRV gII GENE SEQUENCES To express the PRV DNA sequences in the correct translational reading frame as determined from DNA sequence analysis, several new plasmid constructions were made as described below.pxxgB The following procedure was used to place the 5 end of a portion of the PRV gII gene in the correct phase for expression of the PRV gII gene sequence. A 766 bp DNA fragment was isolated from pssgB by digestion of 20 jig of the plasmid with XmaI Fig. 15 . The expression vector pJS413 5 iig was digested with XmaI and treated with 0.6 units of CIAP. The digested DNA were subjected to electrophoresis on a 1 LMP agarose gel and the 6500 bp XmaI linear DNA fragment from pJS413 and the 766 bp XmaI fragment from pssgB excised from the gel. Approximately 100 ng of each fragment were ligated and transformed into E. coliNF1829. Recombinant plasmids were purified using the alkaline mini preparation mentio Sec. 6.7.5. and analyzed by restriction endonuclease mapping for the correct construction. Plasmids in which the PRV sequences were in the correct orientation and in frame with the Cro ATG of pJS413 should yield an approximately 766 bp DNA fragment upon digestion with restriction enzymes BamHI and XhoI. A plasmid designated pJSXma contained a 766 bp PRV DNA insert in the proper orientation to establish the correct reading frame with the Cro ATG. The PRV sequences were, however, not in frame with the lacZ gene. To phase the PRV gII gene sequence with lacZ, the BglII BamHI fragment from pJSXma which encodes PRV gII gene sequences was inserted in plasmid pHK414. The expression plasmid pHK414 5 pg was digested withBamHI and BglII and treated with 0.6 units of CIAP. Plasmid pJSXma 20 p9 was also digested with BglII and BamHI. TheDNA fragments were electrophoresed on a 1 LMP agarose gel and the 6.8 kb linear DNA fragment from pHK414 and the 766 bp PRV DNA fragments from plasmid pJSXma were excised from the gel and subsequently ligated using T4 DNA ligase approximately 100 ng of each fragment . Recombinant plasmids resulting from this ligation were used to transformE. coli NF1829. Ampicillin resistant clones were selected and a plasmid pXXgB which contained the appropriate BglII BamHI PRV DNA insert was isolated. Expression plasmid pXXgB was examined for the expression of a Cro PRV gII ss galactosidase fusion protein as described supra. Total E. coli cell extracts either induced using IPTG or uninduced were subjected to electrophoresis on SDS PAGE gels. Coomassie blue staining of these gels indicated that a Cro PRV gII ss galactosidase fusion protein of approximately 145,000 apparent molecular weight was produced upon induction with IPTG as compared to the uninduced control. The yield of Cro PRV gII ss galactosidase fusion protein was approximately 5 of total cell protein. pPR10 Plasmid pssgB was digested with XhoI and then treated with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I in the presence of the four dNTPs to fill in the cohesive ends Fig. 16 . A 1183 bp XhoI fragment from pssgB was purified on a 1 LMP agarose gel. Plasmid pHK412 was digested with BglII andSmaI and treated with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymeraseI in the presence of the four dNTPs. The 6.Skb linear DNA fragment of pHK412 was purified on a 1 LMP agarose gel, excised and subsequently ligated to the 1183 XhoI fragment from pssgB using T4 DNA ligase. These recombinant plasmids were used to transform E. coli NF1829.Plasmid DNA from Åampicillin resistant colonies was screened by restriction endonuclease digestion with BglII and BamHI the BglII site is reconstituted when the blunt ended BglII site is ligated to the XhoI blunt end for the correct insert. A plasmid, pXh412 was isolated that contained an 1183 bp PRV DNA insert. To construct a plasmid expressing a Cro PRV gII fusion protein, the 1183 bp BglII BamHI DNA fragment of pXh412 was inserted into the plasmid p470 1 Fig. 16 . Plasmid p470 1 is organized as follows pTAC Olac Cro TIC TTS TITerm ori ampr. TIC is an artificial translation initiation complex located 3 to the Cro ATG and consists of the sequence 5 ATGGCTACTGTTAT 3 . TTS is the triple translation terminator sequence. TI Term is a transcription terminator from the E. coli rrnB operon. Plasmid pXh412 was digested with Bg1II and BamHI and a 1183 bp DNA fragment encoding PRV gII DNA sequences was purified on a 1 LMP agarose gel. p470 1 was also digested with BamHI and BglII, treated with CIAP and the linear DNA fragment was purified on a 1 LMP agarose gel. The two DNA fragments were excised from the gel and subsequently ligated using T4 DNA ligase. Recombinant plasmids were used to transform E. coli NF1829. Ampicillin resistant transformants were screened for plasmids containing the 1183 bp BqlII BamHI PRV gII DNA fragment. Clones containing thisPRV DNA insert were screened for the production of a Cro PRV gII fusion protein as described, supra.A plasmid designated pPR10 was selected that expressed a Cro PRV gII fusion protein of approximately 46,000 daltons upon induction with IPTG. Plasmid pPR10 produced about 5 mg liter of this Cro PRV gII fusion protein. pPR14 and pPR15 Plasmid pssgB was partially digested with XhoI and the cohesive ends were filled in using the Klenow fragment ofDNA polymerase I and the four dNTPs FIG. 17 . An 1870 XhoI partial DNA fragment was excised from a 1 LMP agarose gel and inserted into the SmaI site of the expression vector pJS413. After ligation of the two DNA fragments using T4 DNA ligase, recombinant plasmids were used to transform E. coliNF1829. Ampicillin resistant colonies were selected and screened for plasmid DNA containing the approximately 1870 bp PRV gII DNA insert. A clone, designated pxxXhJS was found to contain the PRV XhoI partial fragment of pssgBin the correct orientation. Plasmid p470 1 was digested with BglII and BamHI, treated with ClAP, and the linear DNA fragment was purified on a 1 LMP agarose gel. Plasmid pxxXhJS was digested withBglII and BamHI and an 1870 bp DNA fragment was purified on a 1 LMP agarose gel. The DNA fragments were excised from the gel, ligated using T4 DNA ligase, and the ligation mixture was used to transform E. coli NF1829. Ampicillin resistant transformants were screened for plasmids containing the 1870 bp PRV DNA insert. A clone, designated pPR14, was found to contain the appropriate DNA insert. Plasmid pPR14 is not in phase with the TIC DNA sequence but is in phase with TTS TI TERM and therefore does not express a Cro PRV gIt fusion protein. To adjust the reading frame of the PRV DNA insert at the TIC DNA sequence of this plasmid, pPR14 was digested with Bg1II and the cohesive ends were filled in using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymeraseI. The plasmid was then re ligated using T4 DNA ligase and resulting plasmids used to transform E. Coli NF1829.Ampicillin resistant colonies were screened for plasmids lacking the BqlII site, and a clone designated pPR15 was isolated. This clone was analyzed for the expression of aCro PRV gII fusion protein as described, supra. Plasmid pPR15 was found to express a 70,000 dalton Cro PRV gII fusion protein by analysis of mini aggregate protein extracts on SDS PAGE. 6.9.3. WESTERN BLOT ANALYSIS OF Cro PRV gII FUSION PROTEINS Aggregate fusion proteins expressed by pxxgB, pPR10, and pPR15 were isolated from cultures induced with IPTG and applied to a denaturing 7.5 SDS PAGE gel. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose paper for Western blot analysis as described supra in Sec. 6.6.4. The immobilized fusion proteins were reacted with goat anti PRV sera or a mixture of two PRV gII monoclonal antibodies designated M2 and M3 directed against PRV glycoproteins See, Hampl et al. . Antigen antibody interactions were visualized using 125 an appropriate rabbit antisera and labeled protein A. The nitrocellulose was then exposed to XARS film. Autoradiographs clearly demonstrated that goat anti PRV serum reacted strongly with fusion proteins expressed by plasmids pxxgB, pPR10, and pPR15 and not with another fusion protein containing unrelated virus protein sequences.Autoradiographs of the Western blot also demonstrated that the mixture of two PRV gII monoclonals reacted with the pPR15 fusion protein. The gII monoclonals did not react with the pPR10 fusion protein. The gII monoclonals reacted very weakly or not at all with the pxxgB fusion protein. 7. VACCINATION 7.1. PROTECTION OF MICE AGAINST LETHAL PRV INFECTION USING FUSION PROTEIN EXPRESSED BY ptacNB IN A VACCINE FORMULATION Four groups of Webster Swiss Balb c mice each were injected intramuscularly IM with the following preparations Group 1 received 250 pg of undenatured fusion protein expressed by ptacNB, mixed with formaldehyde and aluminum hydroxide Reheis Chemical Company, BerkeleyHeight, NJ Group 2 received 250 p9 of undenatured fusion protein expressed by ptacNB in phosphate buffered saline Group 3 received 250 pg of urea solubilized fusion protein expressed by ptacNB isolated by the denaturing aggregate purification method described in Section 5.6 fusion protein expressed by ptacNB isolated by this method precipitated when the urea was removed by dialysis , mixed with formaldehyde and aluminum hydroxide and group 4 received 250 9 of urea solubilized ptacNB fusion protein in phosphate buffered saline. At day 21 all mice were injected IM with a further dose of 50 9 of fusion protein expressed by ptacNB prepared as above. The mice were bled retro orbitally at day 20 and day 28.Fourteen days after the second injection the mice were challenged with approximately 5 times LD50 of PRV. The PRV was suspended in cell culture medium and injected IV.Survival of the challenged mice indicated protection.Results are shown in Table I. The mouse protection data indicate that immunization with fusion protein produced by the clone ptacNB was capable of protecting mice from a lethal challenge with PRV.

INOCULATION OF PIGS USING FUSION PROTEIN EXPRESSED BY ptacNB IN A VACCINE FORMULATION Six groups of 3 pigs each were inoculated with the preparations described in Table II for PRV P 1 formulations.Pigs were injected with 2 mt of the vaccine formulation intramuscularly IM and observed for local reactions and pyrogenicity. All pigs were bled at day 0, boosted and bled at 21 days, and bled again at days 28 and 42. Four pigs were held as uninoculated controls.

Therefore, further constructions of plasmids and vaccine formulations were developed as described in Section 6 and below to provide protection against PRV. 7.3. PROTECTION OF MICE AGAINST LETHAL PRV INFECTION USING THE Cro PRV gill FUSION PROTEIN EXPRESSED BY p7 123AM IN A VACCINE FORMULATION Twelve groups of mice were inoculated intramuscularly IM with 250 iig of Cro PRV gill fusion protein. The protein was treated as described in Table III. Three weeks after the initial injection, the mice were boosted with a second 250 iig dose of protein. Control mice received no treatment. The mice were bled retro orbitally 7 days after the boost. Seven days after the second injection Day 0 the mice were challenged with 105 pfu of PRV per mouse. The results are shown in Table III. The mouse protection data indicated that immunization of the mice with the Cro PRV fusion protein solubilized with urea and treated with aluminum hydroxide and formaldehyde provided the best protection against challenge with PRV. The majority of mice did seroconvert as detected by immunoprecipitation of PRV specific glycoproteins of molecular weight 92,000 and 74,000 gIII glycoprotein from PRV infected cells labeled with 3H glucosamine.

PROTECTION OF SWINE USING THE Cro PRV gIll FUSION PROTEIN EXPRESSED BY p7 123AM IN A VACCINE FORMULATION The object of these experiments was to determine the efficacy of a swine vaccination in response to a challenge with PRV in dosage levels of 2 mg and 5 mg per injection and in combination with five different adjuvants. Cro PRV gIll fusion protein was prepared by the aggregate purification method as described supra from plasmid p7 123AM. The Cro PRV gIll fusion protein was solubilized in SDS as follows 100 mt of 0.18 SDS in l0mM Tris, pH9, 500 mM DTT was added to the protein pellet the mixture was heated at 600C for 30 minutes, centrifuged at 9000 x g for 25 minutes at room temperature the protein was dialyzed against l0mM Tris, pH9. The preparation contained approximately 40 pure Cro PRV gIII fusion protein expressed by p7 123AM. Forty five pigs were inoculated intramuscularly 2 mQ dose in the right hind leg with the preparations described in Tables IV and V. Adjuvants used in these experiments included Pluronic Polyol L121 BASF WyandetteCorporation, Wyandotte, MI , DDA dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide Eastman Kodak Company, Rochester, NY Avridine CP 20,961 Pfizer, Inc., NY , Alhydrogel AluminumHydroxide Gel Superfos a s, Denmark and Freund s CompleteAdjuvant Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI . Pigs were injected with the Cro PRV gill fusion protein expressed by p7 123AM in vaccine formulations, boosted after 2 weeks and were observed for local reactions and pyrogenicity.Temperatures were recorded, saliva and blood samples taken and clinical observations respiratory, enteric, neurologic problems, weight gain rate, and death were carefully made.Pigs remained essentially normal throughout this period Table IV . Fourteen days after the first injection, pigs were challenged intranasally with approximately 107 pfu of Becker strain PRV. The pig survival data is presented in Table V.

Control was placebo including average of effect of all adjuvants without PRV antigen.See text for description of the adjuvants. It can be concluded from these experiments that the PRV antigen raised the survival rate of pigs by approximately 60 when compared to the non antigen treated animals. PRV antigens administered with avridine or A1OH3 caused the lease degree of reactions, whereas FCA, L121 and DDA were the most severe. 8.
