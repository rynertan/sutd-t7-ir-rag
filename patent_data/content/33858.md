## Description
CIRCUIT ARRANGEMENT FOR MEASURING THE ELECTRIC CHARACTERISTICS OFUSER TELEPHONE LINES The present invention relates to a circuit arrangement particularly for use in telephone exchanges for measuring the following parameters of user telephone lines direct or alternating foreign voltages insulation resistance between a wire a and a wire b terminal capacity insulation resistance between wires a and b and the earth. It is necessary periodically to control the above specified parameters in telephone exchanges to make sure that proper conditions exist which optimize the quality of the signals exchanges between telephone sets and the exchange. Some telephone exchanges are connected to a very large number of users e.g. some tens of thousands , and thus, to minimize the time spent to detect malfunctioning or absence of the said optimum conditions the circuit arrangement designed to carry out such operations must be capable of measuring the parameters of each loop in a very short time, while ensuring good measuring precision even in the presence of typical noise in the user lines. It should be noted that a line can present noise due to voltage induced by distribution networks. The frequency of such a noise is 50 or 16.6 Hz in Italy. An object of the present invention is to provide a particularly simple and economic circuit arrangement designed to detect the said parameters in short time intervals some seconds . To this end, a circuit arrangement according to the invention is arranged to send a signal on the user line at a frequency which is a fraction of the network frequency, and to measure the average value of the current circulating along the loop during a predetermined time interval. Thus, the circuit arrangement according to the invention comprises in combination the following characteristic elements first means designed to generate a first signal whose frequency is a fraction of the network frequency second means controlled by the said first signal and designed to provide an output signal on its first output and an output signal on its second output, respectively in phase opposition with respect to the said first signal, and to provide on its third output a second signal whose level is proportional to the current circulating in the loop a first switching device arranged to connect the first and the second output of the said second means to a respective wire a or b of the user loop, or the first of the said output to both wires of the loop a first integrating circuit arranged to integrate the said second signal for a time interval equal to half a cycle of the first signal in phase with it a second integrating circuit arranged to integrate the said second signal for a time interval equal to half a cycle of the first signal in advance with respect to it by err 2 a third integrating circuit arranged to integrate the said second rectified signal for a time interval equal to one period of the first signal in phase with it means arranged to measure the amplitude of the signals available at the output of the said integrated circuit. Further features of the invention will appear from the following description of a non limiting embodiment with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which figure 1 illustrates an equivalent diagram of a user telephone line figure 2 shows a block diagram of a circuit arrangement in accordance with the invention figure 3 shows in detail testing means MP of figure 2 in accordance with the present invention figure 4 shows in detail second means SM of figure 2 in accordance with the present invention figure 5 shows in detail timing means MT of figure 2 in accordance with the present invention figure 6 shows in detail measuring means MN of figure 2 in accordance with the present invention figure 7 shows wave forms concerning the preceding figures. A frequency of a few Hzshas been adapted as a measuring frequency, and thus a user telephone loop can be considered as a concentrateconstant circuit of the type illustrated in figure 1 where the meaning of the symbols shown in it is as follows RL indicates the total resistance of the line Rab indicates the resiatnce between the wires a and b Ra indicates the resistance between the wire a and the earth Rb indicates the resistance between the wire b and the earth Rs indicates the resistance of the ringer winding Cs indicates the capacity in series with the ringer. It should be noted that Rs and Cs can indicate an equivalent circuit of a plurality of ringers connected in parallel with one another. It should also be noted that the resistance derived between the wires a and b can be evaluated only as a parallel connection between Rab and tRa Rbj indicated by RD below. To study the circuit, the following reasonable simplifying hypo thesis have been adopted the indictive reactance of the ringer winding is negligible with respect to the measuring frequency for evaluating the derived resistance between the wires a and b, it is assumed R a Rb the presence of noise voltages is not shown in figure 1 since the adopted method has a theoretical infinite rejection with respect to the noise. Figure 2 shows a block diagram of the circuit arrangement in accordance with the invention, the circuit arrangement comprising first means PM designed to generate an output sinusoidal signal having a frequency f, which is submultiple of the network frequency. The signal f, is sent to timing means MT and to second means SM designed to generate two signals in phase opposition with respect to one another on their first two outputs and also to generate, on a third output thereof, a signal sm proportional to the current circulating in the line. A first switching device DS1 is designed to connect the first output of the means SM to respective wires a and b of the line and thus two signals in phase opposition are available on the wires , or to connect the first of the said outputs to both wires on which two signals in phase are thus available . A second switching device DS2 is arranged to connect the wires of the line to the said second means SM, or to testing means MP designed to detect the presence of foreign voltages in the line. The signal sm is sent to a first, a second and a third integrating circuit IN1, IN2, and IN3 which are enabled by respective signels t1, t2 and t3 generated by the said timing means MT. The output of units IN is connected to measuring means MM designed to evaluate the level of the signal available at the output of each integrated circuit. The first operation to be effected is checking the absence of following voltages before proceeding to detect the electric characteristics of the line. To this end, the switching device DS1 is positioned so as to connect the telephone line to the testing means MP which is illustrated in more details in figure 3. The means MP comprises a first pair of comparators CM1 and CM2 which respectively detect the presence of positive or negative foreign voltages on the wire a, and also comprises a second pair of comparators CM3 and CM4 which respectively detect positive or negative foreign voltages on the wire b. Should anyone of the said comparators detect the presence of a voltage exceeding the threshold voltage V applied to the other input, the output mp is energized and thus prosecution to successive measuring operation is prevented. If instead such testing operations give a negative result, the resistance RD between the wires a and b is measured after the switching device DSO has been actuated. The result of such a measuring operation gives indications about the state of deterioration of the insulation between the wires. The carrying out of such a measure comprises generation by the said second means SM of two signals in phase opposition at a frequency f on the two wires a and b, and also generation by the means MT of the signal tl see figure 7 which enables the integrating circuit to integrate, for half a cycle of the signal at frequency fO, the signal sm whose value is proportional to the current circulating in the line. The said means MM are designed to measure the signal in1 available at the output of the unit IN1 at the end of the integrating interval. The measure of value of the terminal capacity gives, instead, indication about the state of the line. When such a measure indicates the absence of user termination, it is likely that the loop is interrupted. Such a measurement is effected in the same way as the previous measurements and comprises enabling the integrating circuitIN2 by the signal t2 which is shifted 900 out phase in advance with respect to fO. Integration of the signal sm during the time interval defined by makes it possible to obtain a signal proportional to the quadrature component in advance with respect to the current circulating in the loop. Also in this case an integration period equal to half a cycle of f, has been adopted to reduce the measuring times. The signal available at the output of the unit INZ is measured by the unit MM. The measurement of the resistance Rt Ra Rb between the wires a and b and the earth gives instead indications about the deterioration of the insulation from the earth. The carrying out of such a measurement comprises switching deviceDS1 which causes the signal in phase with fO available at the first output of the said second means SM being sent through both the wire a and the wire b, and also comprises generation of the signal t3 by the unit MT. The signal t3 enables the unit IN3 to integrate the signal sm which is rectified by way of synchronous inverter IS with the voltage for a time interval equal to one cycle of the signal fO. Integration for a whole cycle has the function of eliminating the influence of the said direct noise voltages. At the end of the integratiion interval the means MM measure the intensity of the signal available at the output of the unit IN3. Figure 4 shows a preferred embodiment of the said second means SM which comprises a first control stage SP1 arranged to receive on its output the signal at the frequency f, which signal is also sent to an inverting circuit CI designed to send the 1800 out of phase signal f, to a second control stage SP2. Each control stage SP comprises a differential amplifier whose non inverting input receives the signal at frequency f, and whose inverting input receives the output signal by way of a resistance R. Such units SP, when seen from the wires a and b, behave as ideal voltage generators owing to negative feedback. The signal available at the output of the unit SP is directly sent to the wire a, whereas the signal available at the output of the unit SP2 is sent to the wire b by way of a current mirror SC.An electrical branch is connected in parralel to the units SP1 andSP2 and comprises two equal series connected resistances Rp between which the said signal sm is derived at the connection point p, the signal being sent to the integrating circuits IN. While measuring the resistance between the wires a and b, in the absence of circulating current, the point 2 is at potential zero. It should also be noted that, even in the presence of a circulating current, the point 2 is at potential zero, unless the current mirror SC is provided. Bearing in mind that such a circuit is capable of inverting the direction of the current in the branch in which it is inserted without changing the sign of the voltage at its terminals, it should be clear that the point 2 is affected, while still remaining at the potential zero in the absence of current i, by a potential difference equal to 2.i.R, when i differs from zero. While measuring the resistance Rt, in the absence of circulating current, the point 2 is always at zero potential, whereas in the presence of current i it undergoes a potential variation equal to i.R. Figure 5 shows an embodiment of the timing means MT which receive the signal f, coming from a first clipping circuit SQ1 which generates on its output a signal sq1 designed to be sent to a timing unitUT arranged to obtain the signals t1 and t3 from such a signal. The means MT also comprises a circuit CS, which is arranged to dephase in advance through 900 the signal f, and has its output connected to a second clipping circuit SQ2 designed to send a signal sq2 to the unit UZ to generate the signal t2. Figure 6 shows an embodiment of the measuring means MM which comprises a peak rectifier RP which receives on its input the signal f, and generates a continuous output signal rp designed to be used to evaluate the Intensity of the signal available at the output of the unit IN. The means MM also comprises comparators CM5, CM6 and CM7 whose first input receives the signal rp and whose second input receives a respective output signal in from the integrating circuit. The use of a reference signal obtained from fO makes it possible to obtain a measure not affected by errors due to amplitude variations in the signal fO since they would determine variations of the same sign in both sm and rp. The unit CM5, CM6 and CM7 thus energize their output if the signal in available on their second input exceeds the threshold determined by the value of rp. According to a further embodiment, the comparators CM comprise as many analogical digital converters designed to express in digital form the level of the signal available at the output of a respective integrating circuit IN. Such converters can be connected to display means for reading the value of the measured parameters.
