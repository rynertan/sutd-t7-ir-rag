# A process of reclaiming rubber.

## Abstract
Chemical direct reclaiming of rubber by mixing pul verulent scrap rubber having a particle size of at most 1 mm, preferably at most 0.4 mm, with a reducing agent, an oxid zable iron metal chloride and at least one plasticizer. The mixture is agitated for a short time, at most 30 min. and normally at most 15 min., in the solid phase in air at a tem perature of not more than 100 C, usually approximately room temperature, in a powder mixer for direct degradation of double bonds in the rubber. The reducing agent is from 0.2 to 1 weight , preferably from 0.2 to 0.8 weight of phenyl hydrazine or from 0.2 to 0.8 weight of diphenyl guanidine. The iron metal chloride is admixed in an amount of from 0.1 to 0.4 weight and is preferably ferrous chlor ide. The plasticizer shall comprise at least one member from the group tall oil pitch and dipentene, and this plasti cizer may optionally be used in mixture with some other plasticizer, such as mineral process oil. The total amount of plasticizer is at most 17.5 weight . The amount of a plasticizer other than tall oil pitch and dipentene is at most 10 weight . The amount of dipentene is at most 5 weight and is from 0.5 to 5 weight if the dipentene is used as the only plasticizer or is used in mixture with another plas ticizer. The amount of tall oil pitch is at most 17.5 weight and is from 7 to 17.5 weight if the tall oil pitch is used as the only plasticizer or is used in mixture with a plasti cizer other than dipentene. If tall oil pitch is used in mix ture with dipentene, the amount of tall oil pitch varies in inverse proportion to the amount of dipentene and is from 8 to 16 weight with dipentene amounts of from 5 to 0,5 weight . All of the percentages are calculated on the mix ture of pulverulent rubber scrap, reducing agent, iron metal chloride and plasticizer. Without preceding refining, the reclaimed pulverulent rubber with a low admixture percentage for example about 6 of raw rubber natural rubber of styrene butadiene rubber can be used directly for the manufacture of vulcan ized rubber products.
