# ELECTRIC ALARM DEVICE

## Abstract
In an electric alarm device, a dish shape housing 1 has an opening on one surface and a substantially flat bottom surface on the other surface. A diaphragm 2 is fixed to the periphery of the housing 1 to close the opening of the hous ing 1 . An armature 4 is mounted within the housing 1 and coupled to the diaphragm 2 to move with the diaphragm 2 . A solenoid coil unit M is fixed to the housing 1 within the housing 1 to generate magnetic fluxes for attracting the armature 4 . A switch SW is mounted within the housing 1 to detect the movement of the diaphragm 2 to conduct and break the current to the solenoid coil unit M .
