## Description
Some purines substituted in 9 position by a substituted butyl radical are known as active against viruses. More specifically, European patent applications published under number 103 551 and 103 552 disclose various linear substitution on the 2 and 3 position of the butyl group. The object of the invention is to find a new family of antiviral compounds. Pandit et al. The present invention relates to hydroxyalkyl substituted purines and pyrimidines having a fused cyclopropane ring in the hydroxyalkyl side chain and the heterocyclic isosteres of said purines and pyrimidines. These compounds have antiviral activity. The compounds are particularly effective against herpes viruses, e.g. herpes simplex virus. The present invention also relates to processes for preparing such compounds. The compounds of the invention may be represented by the formula Most preferably, Y is guanine. The following are representative compounds of the present invention The following compounds are preferred The compounds of the present invention may be prepared by various methods. The following three schemes illustrate these methods According to one method Scheme I , which is similar to that of Noell et al., The resulting 6 hydroxyalkylamino isocytosine of Formula III need not be isolated but may be treated directly with sodium nitrite in aqueous acetic acid at about room temperature to give the 5 nitroso derivative of Formula IV which is readily isolated. Reduction of the nitroso group of the compound of formula IV gives the compound of formula V. The nitroso group of the compound of Formula IV is reduced under conditions such that the resulting amino group is formylated The 9 substituted guanines of Formula VI may also be prepared Scheme II by alkylation of a preformed purine derivative of Formula XII e.g., 2,6 dichloropurine, 2 amino 6 chloropurine or 2 amino 6 benzyloxypurine with a compound of Formula XIII, wherein X is a leaving group such as bromo, chloro, iodo, tosyl, mesyl and the like, and Q is a protecting group removable by hydrolysis such as, for example, benzoyl or acetyl, or by hydrogenolysis such as, for example, benzyl. The alkylation is normally carried out in the presence of a base such as, for example, potassium carbonate, in a suitable solvent such as, for example, dimethylformamide or dimethylsulfoxide. The 9 alkylated product of Formula XIV may be separated from any isomers e.g., the 7 alkylated isomer chromatographically or by other means. Transformation of the substituents Z and W to give the guanine and removal of the protecting group Q may be accomplished by standard methods known to those skilled in the art. Scheme III illustrates the preparation of 9 The pyrimidines, thymine XX and cytosine XXIII are reacted with the chloromethylcyclopropane XVII Schemes IV and V, respectively in the presence of sodium iodide and a base such as potassium carbonate in a polar solvent such as dimethyl sulfoxide or dimethyl formamide, preferably at a temperature of about 70 to 90 C. The alkylated pyrimidines may be purified by chromatography. The benzoyl protecting group may then be removed by standard conditions such as aqueous methylamine, methanolic ammonia, or catalytic sodium methoxide in methanol. The synthetic schemes II V are readily amenable to the synthesis of isosteric purine and oxypyrimidine compounds. This may be accomplished by simply substituting the appropriately preformed isosteric heterocycle for the purine or oxypyrimidine which undergoes the alkylation reaction, i.e., Compound XII in Scheme II adenine in Step 3, Scheme III Compound XX in Scheme IV and Compound XXIII in Scheme V. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are prepared by recrystallization of the desired adenine guanine, 2 amino 6 chloropurine, cytosine, uracil or thymine derivative as the free base or as the acetate or hydrochloride from the aqueous dilute acid of choice. Acid addition salts of adenine derivatives are more stable than the corresponding salts of guanine derivatives. Alkali metal salts of guanine, thymine and uracil derivatives can be made by standard techniques, for example, by dissolving such derivative in water containing one equivalent of an alkali metal hydroxide, followed by evaporation to dryness. In another aspect of the invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition or preparation comprising a compound of the formula wherein Y, Z, R¹ and R² are as hereinbefore defined or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefor. In a particular aspect the pharmaceutical composition comprises a compound of the present invention in effective unit dosage form. As used herein the term effective unit dosage or effective unit dose is denoted to mean a predetermined antiviral amount sufficient to be effective against the viral organisms These pharmaceutical compositions may be given parenterally, orally, used as a suppository or pessary, applied topically as an ointment, cream, aerosol, powder, or given as eye or nose drops, etc., depending on whether the preparation is used to treat internal or external viral infections. For internal infections the compositions are administered orally or parenterally at dose levels of about 0.1 to 250 mg per kg, preferably 1.0 to 50 mg per kg of mammal body weight, and are used in man in a unit dosage form, administered, e.g. a few times daily, in the amount of 1 to 250 mg per unit dose. For oral administration, fine powders or granules may contain diluting, dispersing and or surface active agents, and may be presented in a draught, in water or in a syrup in capsules or sachets in the dry state or in a non aqueous solution or suspension, wherein suspending agents may be included in tablets, wherein binders and lubricants may be included or in a suspension in water or a syrup. Where desirable or necessary, flavoring, preserving, suspending, thickening or emulsifying agents may be included. Tablets and granules are preferred, and these may be coated. For parenteral administration or for administration as drops, as for eye infections, the compounds may be presented in aqueous solution in a concentration of from about 0.1 to 10 , more preferably 0.1 to 7 , most preferably 0.2 w v. The solution may contain additives, such as antioxydants and buffers. Alternatively, for infections of the eye, or other external tissues, e.g. mouth and skin, the compositions are preferably applied to the infected part of the body of the patient as a topical ointment or cream. The compounds may be presented in an ointment, for instance, with a water soluble ointment base, or in a cream, for instance with an oil in water cream base, in a concentration of from about 0.1 to 10 , preferably 0.1 to 7 , most preferably 1 w v.
