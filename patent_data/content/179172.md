# ROLLING METHOD AND ROLLING APPARATUS FOR METAL STRIPS

## Abstract
A method and an apparatus for rolling metal strips by a tandem cold rolling mill. The strip is periodically swung in its width directions at a location upstream of the tandem rolling mill, to bring the strip into contact with rolls of the tandem cold rolling mill over areas of the rolls as widely as possible, thereby preventing irregular wears of the rolls to make it possible to produce defect free metal strips.
