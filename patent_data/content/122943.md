# METHOD OF CONTROLLING CHASING LATHE.

## Abstract
A method of controlling a chasing lathe uses at least two tools TL1, TL2 provided in parallel on one side of a tool slide TBS , and a workpiece WK is machined by employing a succession of predetermined tools. The method comprises inputting data on at least part dimensions, tool selection order, positions to be cut by each tool, and mounting dimen sions from a reference position of each tool and machining at the positions P5 P4 P3 P2 P1 P5 P7 P8 P9 P10 to be machined which are allotted to the respective tools, using the predetermined tools in order on the basis of the data. In addition, during the machining, upon the completion of machining with one tool TL1 , when the subsequent tool TL2 is being positioned at a position which will be machined thereby by moving the tool slide TBS , the tool slide TBS is moved in the Z axis direction to a point Pr at which none of the tools TL1, TL2 will come into contact with the workpiece WK by the movement of the tool slide TBS in the direction X axis direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the workpiece WK Z axis direction . Thereafter, the tool slide is moved in the X axis direction to a point Pt at which the X axis position of the selected tool to coincide with the X axis coordinate of the start position of the machining done by that tool, and then machining is done by employing the selected tool.
