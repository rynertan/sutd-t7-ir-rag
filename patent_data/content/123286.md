# An automotive anti skid brake control system with sampling input time data of wheel speed sensor signals.

## Abstract
An anti skid brake control system for an automotive vehi cle has a control module comprising one or more microcom puters. The microcomputer is connected to a wheel speed sensor, which supplies a sensor signal indicative of the wheel speed, and a timer which outputs a time signal indicative of the elapsed time. The microcomputer has an input time data sampling program for latching the timer signal value and storing the latched timer signal value as input time data for the corresponding sensor signal pulse. The input time data sam pling program is executed as an interrupt program indepen dent of a main program which processes the input time data and controls application and release of hydraulic braking pressure to a vehicle wheel in such a manner that wheel speed is adjusted toward an optimum relationship with vehicle speed. The microcomputer is also provided with a flag regis ter which is incremented everytime the the main program is interrupted for execution of the input time data sampling program and decremented at the end of each cycle of execu tion of the main program. The microcomputer repeatedly executes the main program until the register value of the flag register becomes equal to zero.
