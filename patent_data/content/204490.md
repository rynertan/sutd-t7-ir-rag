# An apparatus and method for producing croissants.

## Abstract
An apparatus and method for producing croissant dough rolls is provided. Dough pieces 37 are fed between two endless belt devices 5, 7 in which the belts 2, 4 move in opposite directions, and rolled up. Means is provided to adjust the gap H between the two belts so as to decrease the gap to roll up the forward end of a dough piece and to increase the gap to permit a smooth rolling up operation. A pair of rollers 39, 41 may be provided adjacent the upstream ends of the endless belt devices to hold the dough pieces, thereby assisting the belt devices in their effective rolling up operation.
