# Infra red radiation detector.

## Abstract
The detector has a pyroelectric element 1 sand wiched between two electrodes 3a, 3b which are transparent to the wavelength of radiation to be de tected. Element 1 is maintained in spaced relationship to the surface 8 of a header 5 by pillar 14 and lead 9 of a microminiature package 13 which is mounted on it s back on surface 8 . A second pyroelectric el ement 2 can be similarly supported by lead 10 and pillar 15 . Electrical connections between the remaining leads 11, 12 and the posts 7a, 7b of the header 5 and between the upper electrodes 3a, 3b of elements 1, 2 can be made with metal foil straps, thus elimi nating the need for bonded wires.
