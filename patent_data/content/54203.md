## Abstract
The volatile fluid is heated to a temperature just below its boiling point prior to being discharged from heat exchanger 18, 46 . In one embodiment of the apparatus, heat exchanger 46 contains a diffusion plate 48 to ensure that the volatile fluid is at the selected temperature when discharged from the heat exchanger. In this embodiment, the apparatus further includes a pressure responsive valve 40 and a bypass line 42 so that a selected pressure is maintained downstream from pump 34 .
