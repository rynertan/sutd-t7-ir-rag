# Liquid dispensing pump.

## Abstract
A liquid dispensing pump in the form of a manually operated trigger sprayer includes a thimble shaped valving element 26 providing inlet and outlet valves 31, 34 , and located within a cylindrical portion of the pump body. In one embodiment, a pressure accumulation chamber 35 is defined between the pump body and the valving element 26 , and a pump piston 37 operates within the valving element and defines therewith a pump chamber in open communication with the accumulation chamber via spaced, flexible and extendable straps which interconnect the inlet and outlet valves for permitting a portion of the valving element to move axially into a discharge valve opening position. Vent valving is effected by either the pump piston or the valving element during inward reciprocation move ment of the piston. In another embodiment, the sprayer is converted into a throttle pump by the provision of a pump piston which operates within the cylindrical portion of the pump body.
