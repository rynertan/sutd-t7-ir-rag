# NONLINEAR AND BISTABLE OPTICAL DEVICE

## Abstract
The invention is a nonlinear or bistable optical device having a low switching energy. The invention uses a means responsive to light for generating a photocurrent, a structure having a semiconductor quantum well region, and means responsive to the photocurrent for electrically controlling an optical absorption of the semiconductor quantum well region. The optical absorption of the semiconductor quan tum well region varies in response to variations in the photocurrent. A photodiode or phototransistor may be used as the means responsive to light, and may be made integral with the structure having the semiconductor quantum well region. An array of devices may be fabricated on a single chip for parallel logic processing.
