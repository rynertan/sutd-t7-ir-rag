## Description
DEPIlATORY COMPOSITIONS TECHNICAL FIELD The invention described herein relates to a depilatory composition comprised of an accelerator comprising biguanide or aminoguanidine or mixtures thereof and an active thiol agent. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The use of thiol based depilatory agents, such as thioglycolic acid, for removal of unwanted body and facial hair is well established in the art.These agents react by reducing hair s protein disulfide bonds to sulfhydryl anions, thereby allowing easy removal of the weakened hairs when washed or wiped away. However, in using thiols, it was discovered that certain conditions facilitated the effectiveness of this reaction. One such condition is high alkalinity to provide ionized reactants. Not only do the high pH s approximately 12.0 12.5 result in ionized thiols, but they also result in increased penetration of a reactant. Substances to provide further enhancement of penetration by active thiols were developed. Further progress in the area of depilation resulted in the development of compounds which seem to expose more of the disulfide bonds to thiol agents. It is thought that these compounds decrease inter and intra chain bonding in hair keratin thereby, accelerating t ttie the rate of penen tration and thus reaction by the thiols. Ureas, thioureas, and guanidines are thought to react as such accelerators, and in fact, the prior art discloses many of these nitrogen based depilatory accelerators. Among such prior art references are U.S.Patent 2,192,380, March 5, 1940 to David Walker.Jayne, Jr. U.S. Patent 3,194,736, July 13, 1965 to Ernest Brown John E.

Xn addition to the above mentioned disclosures, biguanides have been chemically reacted with ethylene sulfide to form thiol depilatory derivatives, U.S..Patent 2,453,333, November 9, 1948 to Leonard P. Moore and Walter P. Ericks. In addition, U.S. Patent 2,174,497, September 26, 1939 to William H. Hill discloses a method of unhairing hides and satins hy combining biguanide with an alkaline hydrolyzing agent. However, no thiol depilatory with biguanide as an accelerator is suggested by Hill. Aminoguanidine has been combined with alkaline hydrolyzing agents, such as calcium hydroxide, for unhairing hides and skins, Moore, E.K.and Kopperhoefer, R., J. American LeatherChemists Association, 28 245 259 1933 .However, no thiol depilatory combined with aminoguanidine is suggested by Moore and Kopperhoefer. The present invention provides not only more effective and faster removal of unwanted body and facial hair than urea accelerators, but thecombina tion of the accelerators herein with a thiol depilatory is safer for human usage in comparison to guanidine and thiourea accelerators. It is an object of the present invention to provide safe and effective removal of unwanted body and facial hair. It is a further object to provide depilatory compositions containing an aminoguanidine or a biguanide or mixtures thereof and an active thiol depilatory agent. These and other objectives will become readily apparent from the detailed description which follows. All percentages and ratios used herein are by weight unless otherwise specified. SUD1ARY OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to depilatory compositions which use aminoguanidine and or biguanide as an accelerator for active thiol depilatory agents. DESCRXPTION OF THE INVENTION The depilatory composition o√ß the present invention not only is safer than guanidine and thiourea compounds, but it also reduces depilation time. This reduction in time for removal of unwanted hair is advantageous for several reasons.First of all, the average person using such compositions prefers reduced time of depilatory action. Secondly, this reduction permits less exposure of skin to possible irritation due to high alkalinity or exposure to thiol actives. The increased rate of hair removal obtained by the present invention is believed to be due to the acceleration by aminoguanidine and or biguanide, allowing the thiol active to more readily exert its depilatory effect.Essential Components The composition of the present invention is based upon three essential ingredients, the accelerators a thiol depilatory, and water. The essential accelerators herein are selected from the group consisting of aminoguanidine, biguanide, their salts and mixtures thereof. Aminoguanidine, formula presented in the figure below, can be used in base or salt form at concentrations providing from about 0.01M to about 2.OM aminoguanidine, preferably from about 0.5M to about 1.OM aminoguanidine. Suitable salts of aminoguanidine include the hydrochloride form, sulfate form, bicarbonate form, and mixtures thereof.EMI4.1 Aminoguanidine Biguanide, formula presented in the figure below, can be used in base or salt form at concentrations providing from about 0.01M to about 2.OM biguanide, preferably from about 0.5M to about 1.0M biguanide. Suitable salts of biguanide include the hydrochloride from, sulfate form, bicarbonate form, and mixtures thereof.EMI5.1 Biguanide The thiol active may. include one or more thiol acids, e.g. thioglycolic, thiolactic acid, and mercaptopropionic acid , or the alkali and or the alkaline earth metal salts of these acids. Xn addition, other active thiol agents can be used. These include a mercaptoethanol1 thioglycerols, 1,3 dithio 2 propanol, 1,4 dithio 2 butanol, 1,4dimercato 2,3 butanediol, 1,3 dithio 2 methoxy propane, l,3 dimercapto 2 aminopropane, 1,4 dimer capto 2, 3 diaminobutane, aminoethanethiol, and related effective thiol actives. The thiol active is present at a concentration of from about 0.1M to about 2.0M, preferably froul about 0.2M to about 1.OM thiol. Mixtures of thiol actives also may be used in the compositions described herein Water from about 10 to about 80 , preferably from about 20 to about 70 , makes up the third essential component of the present invention. The pH of the present depilatory composition should range from about 10.5 to about 12.5, preferably from about 11.0 to about 12.3 at 2 These pH s preferably are achieved through the use of an alkaline material such as calcium hydroxide.Optional Components The present invention can be embodied in several commercial.forms such as creams, lotions, gels, aerosols, or the like. If the present invention is put into such forms, a number of optional ingre dients would be added. These ingredients include from about 0 to about 5 of a suitable filler such as chalk, magnesium oxide and carbonate, clays, talc, fumed silica and mixtures thereof. Emulsifiers such as anionic surfactants e.g., fatty alcohol sulfates and or alkyl aryl sulfates , nonionic surfactants, and mixtures thereof, present at levels of from about 0 to about 20 , are also useful. Often chelating agents to complex with metals are included in such compositions. One suitable example of such a chelator is ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, its salts and mixtures thereof. Among the other ingredients useful in these various embodiments is a gelling agent or thickener, present at levels of from about 0 to about 30 . The thickeners used could include both natural and synthetic ones such as tragacanth, xanthan, karaya, and guar gums, clays, methyl or hydro2yethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, fatty and polyvinyl alcohols, modified starches and sugars, and mixtures thereof Emollients such as paraffin, petrolatum, mineral oil, fatty alcohols, silicone oils, and mixtures thereof present at levels of from about 0 to about 60 , can also be included.
