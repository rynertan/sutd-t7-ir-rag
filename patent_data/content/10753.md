# A paper tape punch and reader assembly.

## Abstract
An assembly for processing paper tape for data proces sing and communication applications. The punch and reader are in a common housing which includes a self contained chad box. The assembly has a substantially flat bottom surface thus permitting the assembly to be mounted on a table. The entire operating mechanism is arranged such that it is mechanically isolated from the housing. The punch 2 and reader 3 assemblies utilize identi cal paper drive assemblies 25, 27 which are mechanically linked by a rigid bar 28 . The one drive assembly 25 is driven from an eccentric 24 which in turn is driven by a flexible belt 23 coupled to a motor pulley 22 .
