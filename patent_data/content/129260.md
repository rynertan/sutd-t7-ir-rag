# PROCESS AND COMPOSITION FOR CONDITIONING AN AQUEOUS SYSTEM

## Abstract
An aqueous system, for example sewage or animal farm waste, is conditioned by the addition of an alkaline earth metal hydroxide, e.g. lime a weighting agent, e.g. calcium carbo nate and a high molecular weight cationic polyelectrolyte, e.g. a polyacrylamide. The hydroxide and the weighting agent are used in a weight ratio of from 9 1 to 1 9 and are preferably mixed together as an aqueous slurry before addition to the system to be conditioned.
