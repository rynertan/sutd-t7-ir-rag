## Description
2 PENEM COMPOUNDS AND A METHOD FOR PRNG THEMThe present invention relates to 2 penem compounds of the formulaEMI1.1 wherein R is lower alkyl, aminoloweralkyl, mono or diloweralkylaminoloweralkyl, acylaminoloweralkyl, aralkyl, heteroaralkyl, hydroxyloweralkyl, hydroxyaralkyl, carboxyloweralkyl or alkoxycarbonylloweralkyl.R1 is hydrogen, lower alkyl, aralkyl or a group of the formula R6CHOH with R6 being hydrogen, lower alkyl, ralkyl, heteroaryl, heteroaralkyl, hydroxyaralkyl or aryl R2 is hydrogen or methyl andX is cyano, tetrazol 5 yl, COOR3 or CONR4R5 whereinR3 is hydrogen, an alkali metal cation, phthalidyl or a pivaloyloxymethyl group andR4 and R5 are independently hydrogen or lower alkyl with the proviso that when X is COOR3 both R1 and R2 cannot be hydrogen. The lower alkyl groups referred to above contain 1 to 6 carbon atoms and are exemplified by methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, and the corresponding branched chain isomers thereof.The acyl substituents referred to above contain 2 7 carbon atoms and are exemplified by acetyl, propionyl, butyryl, valeryl and the like and which may be optionally substituted by up to three chlorine atoms.The term aryl as used herein refers to phenyl substituted by lower alkyl, lower alkoxy and halogen groups, e.g., p tolyl, o tolyl, m tolyl, p chlorophenyl, o methoxyphenyl, etc.The term heteroaralkyl as used herein refers to lower alkyl groups substituted by an unsaturated heterocyclic group heteroaryl group such as 2 pyridyl, 3 pyridyl, 4pyridyl, furyl, thienyl or the like. The heteroaryl group may optionally contain 1 to 3 lower alkyl substituents, e.g., 2 methylpyridyl, 3 methylthienyl, etc.The alkoxy groups referred to above likewise contain 1 to 6 carbon atoms and are exemplified by methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, and the like. The term aralkyl denotes lower alkyl groups substituted by one or more aryl groups such as benzyl, phenethyl, benzhydryl and the like.The alkali metal cations referred to above preferably are potassium and sodium but may also be lithium, rubidium or cesium.The compounds of formula I possess several centers of chirality and all isomeric forms of the compounds of formula I, and mixtures thereof are embraced by this invention.With respect to those in the penem nucleus itself, the preferred configuration at the 5 and 6 positions are of the absolute stereochemistry R and S, respectively. The two hydrogen atoms attached to the 5 and 6 carbon atoms are thus trans to one another. The stereochemistry of theC 8 carbon atom when R1 is R6CHOH may be either R or S depending on the exact nature of the R6 substituent.For instance, the compoundswherein R6 is methyl preferably have the 8R stereochemistry thus being designated 5R,6S, 8R. The most preferred stereochemical configuration for a 6 R6CHOH compound of this invention is represented by the following formula EMI4.1 The R,S nomenclature may differ depending on the nature of the R6 substituent. Wherein the R6 group of formula I has a higher priority in the Cahn Ingold Prelog system, a a 2 pyridyl group, a compound having the above shown most preferred stereochemical configuration will be designated 5R, 6S, 8S but be of the same relative spatial configuration at C 5, C 6 and C B as a 5R, 6S, 8R compound, wherein the R6 group has a lower priority, e.g. the methyl group.The compounds may be prepared as their racemic mixtures, e.g., a 5R,6S,8R compound is produced with its enantiomer mirror image , i.e., a 5S,6R,8S compound, in equal amounts when the starting compound is a racemic mixture. The two enantiomers may be separated by conventional means, e.g., by fractional crystallizations of optically active salt forms, e.g., the salts derived from optically active amino com pounds,e.., brucine, or and ephedrine.Alternatively, the compounds may be produced in their pure enantiomeric forms by utilizing optically active starting materials in the synthetic procedure.The designations of absolute spatial configuration are based on X ray crystal analysis.One preferred group of compounds of formula I embraces those compounds wherein R2 is hydrogen, X is COOR3, R1 is the group R6 CHOH and R, R3 and R6 are as defined above. A most particularly preferred group therein embraces compounds having the spatial configuration of formula III, wherein X is COOR or COO alkali metal, R is lower alkyl or aminoloweralkyl and R6 is hydrogen, lower alkyl or heteroaryl. Of these the compounds wherein R is ethyl or aminoethyl and R6 is methyl are most highly preferred.Another preferred group of compounds of formula I embraces those compounds wherein X is cyano, tetrazol 5 yl, or CONR4R5 with R4 and R5, R1, R2 and R being as defined above.A most particularly preferred group therein embraces compounds wherein R1 is hydrogen or the group R6CHOH ,R2 is hydrogen, X is tetrazol 5 yl and R and R6 are as defined above.The compounds of this invention possess antibacterial activity of both the gram positive and gram negative type.Thus, when tested in standardized microbiological assays, the compounds of this invention are active against such gram positive organisms as Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Bacillus subtilis, and such gram negative organisms as E. coli and Salmonella at test levels of 0.1 to 100 ug ml. Additionally, they show activity against such organisms in the presence of ss lactamase indicating a resistance to these enzymes and are inhibitors of beta lactamases.For instance, potassium 5R,6S,8R 6 1 hydroxyethyl 2 ethylthiopenem 3 carboxylate is active againstStaphylococcus 76070103 at a test level of less than 0.06 pg ml and against E. coli JR66 at a test level of 0.5 rg ml. When tested against B. subtilis 1119601 a betalactamase containing organism , this compound exhibits activity at 0.06 fg ml. Thus, the present invention includeswithin its scope pharmaceutical compositions comprising an antibacterially effective amount of a penem of formula I specifically the compound mentioned in the preceding paragraph or a mixture thereof with its enantiomer together with a compatible, pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient, and dosage forms, specifically for oral use. bne particular pharmaceutical composition comprises the alkali metal 5RS,6RS,8SR 6 1 hydroxyethyl 2 ethylthio penem 3 carboxylate alone or in combination with the corresponding 5RS,6SR,8RS or SR,6S,8R isomer preferably in a w w ratio of 20 45 55 80 , this composition being substantially free from the other isomers 5RS,6SR,8SR and 5RS, 6RS,8RS . As regards antibacterial spectrum the isomers of the above combination surprisingly complement each other.The dosaaeadministered of the penems of this invention is dependent upon the age and weight of the animal species being treated, the mode of administration, and the type and severity of bacterial infection being prevented or reduced. Typically, the dosage administered per day will be in the range of 100 5000 mg, with 500 1000 mg being preferred.For oral administration, the compounds of this invention may be formulated in the form of tablets, capsules, elixirs or the like. Likewise, they may be admixed with animal feed.They may also be applied topically in the form of ointments, both hydrophilic and hydrophobic, in the form of lotions which may be aqueous, non aqueous or of the emulsion type, or in the form of creams.The compounds of formula I may be utilized in liquid form such as solutions, suspensions and the like for otic and optic use and may also be administered parenterally via intra muscular injection.The compounds of this invention are prepared by cyclising a compound of the formulaEMI7.1 wherein R, R t R2 are as defined above any functional group therein being optionally protected, X is protected tetrazol 5 yl, cyano, protected carboxyl, protected carbamoyl or CONR4R5 with substituents R4 and R5 being as defined above and at least one of them being lower alkyl Z is sulfur or oxygen and Y is a phosphonio group being double bonded to the adjacent carbon atom or a phosphonato group with a single bond to the adjacent carbon atom the negative charge of which is compensated by the presence of a cation if required, separating a mixture of diastereoisomers before or after removing any protecting group and then subjecting a so obtained compound to one or more of the facultative steps i to viii i introducing phthalidyl or pivaloyloxymethyl in substituent X ii acylation of a compound of formula I wherein R is aminoloweralkyl iii transamidation or hydrolysis of a compound of for mula I wherein R is acylaminoloweralkyl iv separation of a mixture of enantiomers v formation of a salt vi conversion of the carboxyl group representing X into a corresponding amido group CONR4R5 with R4 and R5 being as defined above vii conversion of the carboxyl group representing X into the cyano group and viii conversion of the cyano or carbamoyl group repre senting X into the tetrazol 5 yl group with the proviso that when in formula II X is protected carboxyl and R1 and R2 are both hydrogen, one of steps vi or vii must be carried out.The cyclization is generally conducted at a temperature between 30 to 1600C and preferably at reflux temperatures in an organic solvent such as benzene, toluene or xylene under an inert atmosphere, e.g. , nitrogen or argon. Reaction times generally vary from 12 48 hours.The group Y in the starting material of formula II is a phosphonio group customary for a Wittig reaction, especially a triaryl , e.g. triphenyl or tri p methoxy phenyl , or tri lower alkyl, e.g. tributylphosphonio, or a phosphonato group, e.g. diphenylphosphonato or dimethoxyphosphonato.The conventional amino protecting groups, e.g. benzyloxycarbonyl, p nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl and benzhydryloxycarbonyl, and carboxy protecting groups, e.g. benzyl, nitrobenzyl and benzhydryl, can be removed by hydrogen ation. Certain amino and hydroxy protecting groups such as trichloroethoxycarbonyl may be removed prior to the carboxy protecting group by deprotection via zinc acetic acid in a suitable aprotic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran.Most preferably, however, the allyl protecting group will be utilized as carboxy protecting group. This group is most preferably removed by utilizing a suitable aprotic solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether or methylene chloride, with potassium or sodium 2 ethylhexanoate dr 2 ethylhexanoic acid and a mixture of a palladium compound and triphenyl phosphine as the catalyst. This deprotection method is particularly suitable for the sensitive betalactam carboxylates of this invention. Use of the potassium or sodium 2 ethylhexanoate provides the corresponding salt, while use of 2 ethylhexanoic acid affords the free carboxy, amine or hydroxy group.The starting materials of formula II are preparable by a reaction sequence starting with a compound of the formulaEMI10.1 wherein R1 and R2 are as defined for formula I and R7 is phenyl or an alkyl group containing 1 6 carbon atoms When Rl is a group of the formula R6 CHOH the hydroxy substituent must be blocked prior to reaction with a suitable protecting group, e.q. benzyloxycarbonyl, p nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl, benzhydryloxycarbonyl, allyloxycarbonyl or trichloroethoxycarbonyl.The compound IV is reacted with chlorosulfonylisocyanate, followed by a hydrolytic workup, according to procedures disclosed in Annalen, 1974, 539, and German Patents 1906401 and 1945549 to provide the intermediate af formula V EMI11.1 An alternate method of preparation of the intermediate of formula V involves ozone oxidation of a 4 phenyl, 4methoxyphenyl, or 4 vinylazetidinone having the desiredR1 substituent at the 3 position to obtain the 4 carboxylic acid compound. The 4 phenyl and 4 methoxyphenyl compounds are preparable by the process of Anew, Chem. Int. Ed. 7, 172 1968 while the 4 vinyl compound is preparable from the process of Canadian J.Chem. 50, 3196 1972 . The 4carboxylic acid compound is then treated with lead tetraacetate in an inert solvent to provide the desired inter mediate of formula V .A further alternative route to intermediates similar to those of formula V wheren R1 is R6 CHOH compounds of formula VII starts with 4 ethylthioazetidin 2 one preparable according to the procedures of Liebigs Ann.Chem., 1974 539 560. This starting material is treated with a suitable amine protecting group for the NH function to afford the l protected 4 ethylthioazetidin 2one. Preferrred protecting groups are those such as tbutyldimethylsilyl, triethylsilyl, or tetrahydropyranyl, with t butyldimethylsilyl being particularly preferred. Typically, the reaction is conducted in an organic solvent such as dichloromethane or chloroform in the presence of an acid acceptor. The acid acceptor may be an inorganic or organic base, but organic bases such as triethylamine are generally preferred. Typically, temperatures are from OOC to room temperature, and typical times range from 5 60 minutes, depending upon the nature of the reactants.The l protected 4 ethylthioazetidin 2 one is treated with a strong base to form an anion at the 3 position which is reacted without isolation with an aldehyde of the formula R CHO wherein R6 is as hereinbefore defined, to afford the intermediate of the formula VI EMI13.1 wherein R6 is as hereinbefore defined and R20 is a nitrogen protecting group. The base utilized to form the anion is one such as lithium di isopropylamine, lithium bis trimethylsilyl amide, n butyl lithium or sec butyl lithium.Generally, an anhydrous aprotic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or ethyl ether is utilized. Preferred temperatures range from 80 C to 600C during the production of the anion. After addition of the aldehyde R6CHO the reaction mixture may be allowed to warm to room temperatures.This reaction produces a mixture of 4 isomers which may be utilized further without separation or which may be optionally separated by chromatography at this stage.The intermediate of formula VI is then treated with a suitable hydroxy blocking reagent to afford the intermediate of the formula VI EMI14.1 wherein R6 and R20 are as hereinbefore defined and R15 is a suitable hydroxy protecting group. Suitable hydroxy protecting groups are those such as 2,2,2 trichloroethoxycarbonyl, l,l,l trichloro 2 methyl 2 propoxycarbonyl, pnitrobenzyloxycarbonyl or allyloxycarbonyl, with 2,2,2trichloroethoxycarbonyl being preferred. Typically, the reaction is conducted in an organic solvent, e.g. methylene chloride in the presence of an acid acceptor, e.g. triethylamine. The R20 nitrogen protecting group may then be removed by 20 conventional methods depending upon the exact nature of the R20 nitrogen protecting group utilized. This affords the intermediate of the formula VII EMI14.2 wherein R6 and R15 are as hereinbefore defined.Treatment of the intermediate of formula V with a nucleophile of the formula VIII or treatment of the intermediate of formula VII with chlorine, followed immediately by a nucleophile of the formula VIII EMI15.1 wherein R is as defined for formula I and has suitable amino , hydroxy and or carboxy protecting groups, andZ is sulfur or oxygen, affords the compound of formula IX EMI15.2 A monosubstituted lactam of formula V or VII , i.e. wherein R2 is hydrogen and R1 is other than hydrogen, will give predominately the trans product in the nucleophilic reaction together with a small amount of the cis product.Thus, the compounds of formula IX produced will have predominately the following relative stereochemistryEMI15.3 The nucleophile of formula VIII is generated in situ by reaction of carbon disulfide, the appropriate thiol and a base such as potassium or sodium hydroxide. Generally, the addition of chlorine is at low temperatures 30 to 100C , but the subsequent reaction with the nucleophile of formula VIII is conducted at slightly higher tempe ratureS,e.g. 10 to 100C. This reaction produces predominately the two trans isomers, e.g. the compounds differing in their relative stereochemistry at the asymmetric carbon attached at the 3 positionO the azetidin 2one ring. These two isomers are separated by conventional methods, e.g. crystallization and or chromatography, at this stage of the reaction sequence.In the foregoing procedure VIO VI VII , if the removal of the R20 nit rogen protecting group and introduction of the R15 oxygen protecting group is postponed until after the reaction with chlorine and the nucleophile of formula VIII , there is produced a product mixture containing predominately the two cis isomers of the following formula after appropriate introduction of the R15 hydroxy protecting group EMI17.1 which are then separated by conventional methods, e.g.crystallization and or chromatography, at this stage of the reaction sequence, together with the two trans isomers.The compounds of the above formulae are each produced by the above described processes in admixture with an equal quantity of their mirror images. Where the pure optically active final products are desired, the intermediates may be resolved by conventional means into their optically active forms. Alternatively, optically active compounds of formula IX , wherein R2 is hydrogen are preparable by starting from naturally occurring optically active penicillins.One such particularly preferred process comprises a treatment of an optically active compound of the formulaEMI17.2 wherein R3 is a lower alkyl or aralkyl group and R1 is as hereinabove defined, with elemental chlorine, to afford predominately the trans intermediate of the formulaEMI18.1 b ozonolysis thereof to afford the intermediate of theformulaEMI18.2 c and reaction thereof with a nucleophile of the formula VIII EMI18.3 The first step a of this process is typically conducted in a suitable organic solvent at temperatures of about 30 to OOC. Particularly suitable solvents are those such as methylene chloride, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, toluene and xylene. Preferably, a nitrogen atmosphere is also used.The elemental chlorine is typically added as a solution having concentration of 0.5 to 5 M in a suitable organic solvent, e.g. carbon tetrachloride. The second step b of the above described process is typically conducted at low temperatures,e.g. about 80 to about 400C in a non polar, organic solvent. Most preferably, the same solvent is utilized for this step as for step a of the instant process. A particularly suitable solvent is methylene chloride but others, such as chloroform, or xylene, may also be used.The final step c of the above described process may be conducted without isolation and purification of the intermediate. Typically, this reaction is conducted at temperatures of about 0 to 500C, with room temperatures being most particularly preferred.The nitrogen of the lactam of formula IX is then reacted with an aldehyde X CHO to afford the compound of formula x EMI19.1 wherein X is protected tetrazol 5 yl, e.g. l benzyltetrazol 5 yl, cyano, protected carboxyl, protected carba moyl, e.g. benzylcarbamoyl, or CONR4R5. R4R4 being as above defined and at least one is lower alkyl . The carboxyl protecting group may be any suitable group such as e nitrobenzyl, benzyl, allyl or benzhydryl. In a highly preferred embodiment, it will be an allylic group so as to provide the possibillty of applying neutral conditions when it is removed at the end of the reaction sequence.This reaction is usually preferably conducted at reflux temperatures ina non polar aprotic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or benzene. Reaction times of 2 10 hours are generally typical.The compound of formula X is then treated with a chlorinating or brominating agent, e.g. thionyl chloride, methanesulfonyl chloride, thionyl bromide, or phosphorous tribromide in the presence of an equivalent of an acid acceptor, e.g. pyridine or triethylamine,so as to afford replacement of the hydroxy group in position a relative to the ring nitrogen.Suitable solvents are those such as methylene chloride, tetrahydrofuran or benzene. Temperatures of about 0 200C and reaction times of 10 60 minutes are generally preferred.This chloride or bromide is then reacted with a suitable phosphine, e.g. tri p methoxyphenyl phosphine, tributylphosphine or most preferably, triphenylphosphine to afford the compound of the formula II . Typically, the reaction is conducted at room temperature in a polar aprotic solvent such as hexamethylphosphoramide or dimethylformamide. Reaction times generally vary from about 12 48 hours.The transformations of compound IX to compound II are generally according to the procedures described byWoodward, et. al., Helv. Chim. Acta., 55, 408 423 1972 .Alternatively, in this synthetic procedure, when trimethoxyphosphine or sodium diphenylphosphinate is used in place of e.g. triphenylphosphine the corresponding dimethoxyphosphonate or diphenylphosphonate is obtained.Treatment of this phosphonate with a base such as sodium hydride in a polar solvent Idimethylformamide results in an unlsolated intermediate of the structureEMI22.1 which is also embraced by formula II . The compounds of formula I wherein R is a phthalidyl 3 or pivaloyloxymethyl group are prepared by reaction of the corresponding compound wherein R3 is an alkali metal cation with chlorophthalide or pivaloyloxymethyl chloride in a solvent such as dimethylformamide. Preferably, a catalytic amount of sodium iodide is added.While it is possible to prepare compounds of formula I , wherein X is cyano, tetrazol 5 yl or an amide group, by using the appropriately substituted starting material of formula II as described hereinabove it is also feasible to convert the carboxyl group representing X in a compound of the formula I into an amide group, a cyano group or a tetrazol 5 yl group after the main reaction took place.The preparation of amides is effected according to known methods, for example by reacting the penem 3 carboxylic acid with ethylchloroformate or isobutylchloroformate in the presence of a tertiary amine, such as triethylamine, and the resulting product is further reacted without isolation with the desired amine or aqueous ammonia.In the latter case the resulting carboxamide may be further reacted according to the procedure of U.S. Patent 4,136,096, e.g. with p toluenesulfonyl chloride in pyridine, to yield the corresponding cyano compound, i.e.the compound of formula I , wherein X is cyano.Compounds of formula I , wherein X is the tetrazol 5 yl group may be obtained from the corresponding amide or cyano compound.
