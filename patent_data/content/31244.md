# Process for producing methanol from synthesis gas with palladium calcium catalysts.

## Abstract
A catalytic process for the production of methanol from hydrogen and carbon monoxide at a temperature of from about 200 C to about 400 C and a pressure of from about 150 to about 20,000 psia which comprises effecting the reaction in the presence of a heterogeneous solid catalyst comprising palladium and calcium.
