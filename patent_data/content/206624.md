## Description
DIPEROXY ACIDS AND BLEACHING THEREWITH Allen D. Clauss Eugene P. Gosselink FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention pertains to certain novel alkyl and phenyl substituted diperoxy glutaric and adipic acids which have utility as oxidizing agents, particularly in the bleaching of fabrics. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The bleaching properties and disinfectant properties possessed by oxidizing agents are well known. The most common types of oxidizing agents used for bleaching and disinfecting are chlorine e.g., hypochlorites and chloramines hydrogen peroxide and other peroxy compounds chlorite and chlorine dioxide. The need for improved oxidizing agents for disinfecting and bleach use is increasing in view of energy conservation and environmental protection measures. For example, in the detergent industry improved cleansing of fabrics is being sought since washing performance has suffered because of lower wash temperatures, reduced use of phosphate builders and increased use of synthetic fabrics. The use of improved oxidizing agents for bleaching is an effective way to restore this lost performance. A number of peroxy compounds have been evaluated as bleaching agents and some of these have been diperoxy acids.For example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,959,163, Farley, issued May 25, 1976, and 4,094,808, Stewart et al., issued June 13, 1978, disclose bleach compositions where the active agent is diperisophthalic acid U.S. Pat. No. 4,134,850, McCrudden et al., issuedJanuary 16, 1979, discloses bleaching compositions where the active agents is a cycloaliphaticdiperoxy acid and U.S. Pat. Nos.2,813,896, Krimm, issued November 13, 1957, and 4,126,573,Johnson, issued November 21, 1978, disclose bleaching utility for alpha omega long chain aliphatic diperoxy acid. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,487,723, Mayer, issued December 11, 1984, and 4,391,725, Bossu, issued July 5, 1983, disclose certain alkyl and or phenyl substituted diperoxy succinic acids and their use as fabric bleaches. Although satisfactory results are achieved using the diperoxy acids disclosed in various of the foregoing references, there remains a need for new and structurally different diperoxy acids to satisfy specialized applications in home laundry bleaching and in disinfecting. Hence, those skilled in the art of bleach and disinfectant composition formulation are constantly looking for new and improved peroxy compounds for use as in such formulations.The present invention provides to the art a group of novel diperoxy acids which are highly suitable for use in bleaching andlor disinfecting compositions. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to novel peroxyacids having the formula HO3C X CO3H I Rm wherein X is an alkylene group selected from propylene and butylene, R is alkyl containing from 4 to 12 carbon atoms or phenyl and m is 1 or 2. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the present invention it has been found that certain substituted diperoxy glutaric and adipic acids are highly suitable oxidizing agents for use as laundry bleaching agents. They are also suitable for disinfectant use. The compounds of the invention have the general formula HO3C X CO3H I R m wherein X is a propylene i.e., CH2CH2 CH2 or butylene li.e., CH2CH2C H2CH2 group and R is an alkyl acyclic or cyclic group containing from about 4 to about 12 preferably from about 6 to about 8 carbon atoms, benzyl or phenyl, substituted onto said propylene or butylene group, and m is 1 or 2. Preferably m is 1. When X is propylene the compounds are substituted diperoxyglutaric acids and when X is butylene the compounds are substituted diperoxyadipic acids.Exemplary compounds are t3 hexyldiperoxyglutaric acid, 8 cyclohexyldiper oxyglutaric acid, ss octyidiperoxyglutaric acid, a decyldiperoxyglutaric acid a heptyldiperoxyglutaric acid, a phenyldiperoxyglu taric acid, B phenyldiperoxyglutaric acid, a benzyldiperoxyglu taric acid, a t butyldiperoxyadipic acid, or pentyldiperoxyadipic acid, a octyldiperoxyadipic acid, a decyldiperoxyadipic acid, a phenyidiperoxyadipic acid, a cyclohexyldiperoxyadipic acid, a benzyldiperoxyadipic acid, B hexyldlperoxyadi pic acid, B oc tyldiperoxyadipic acid, g t octyldiperoxyadipic acid, ss dodecyl diperoxyadipic acid, B phenyldiperoxyadipic acid, ss, ss dihexyl diperoxyglutaric acid, Fmethyl 15 hexyldiperoxyglutaric acid and B ethyl B octyldiperoxyglutaric acid. The compounds of the invention exhibit a unique combination of surface activity, water solubility and chemical stability in aqueous solution which has not been observed in other peroxyacids. The compounds are particularly effective bleaching agents for use in hard water. The presence of hydrophobic substituent groups and hydrophilic percarboxy groups in the same molecule renders the molecule surface active, thereby causing,. in an aqueous solution, a concentration of the diperoxyacid molecules at the surface of the substrate e.g., fabric being treated with the solution. It is believed that the 3 4 carbon atom spacing between the percarboxy groups in these compounds, in combination with the preferred alkyl chain lengths, is about optimal for achieving maximum surface activity while retarding formation of micelles. Micellization of the diperoxyacid compounds in solution tends to inhibit concentration of the compounds at substrate surfaces and promotes nonproductive decomposition in solution, thereby reducing bleaching and or disinfecting efficiency. The compounds of the invention are solids at room temperature and therefore can conveniently be formulated in granular compositions such as laundry granules. The peroxyacids of the invention can be made by oxidation of the parent dicarboxylic acids by known oxidation techniques, such as by hydrogen peroxide in either a water sulfuric acid or water methanesulfonic acid solvent system. See U.S. Pat. Nos.4,119,660, Hutchins, issued October 10, 1978 4,233,235, Camden et al., issued November 11, 1980 4,244,884, Hutchins, issuedJanuary 13, 1981 and 4,487,723, Mayer, issued December 11, 1984, all incorporated by reference herein. The parent dicarboxylic acids can be made by known synthetic techniques. Some examples are given below. a alkylglutaric acids can be prepared by malonic ester synthesis techniques. See J. C. Roberts et al., J. Chem. Soc.p. 2482 1950 , incorporated by reference herein. The following reaction sequence is followed EMI4.1 In preparing the a alkyladipic acids the same procedure is followed, except that in the second step, I CH2 3CO2Et is used as the substituting agent instead of l CH2 2CO2Et Benzyl iodide can be used in place of alkyl iodide in the first step to prepare the corresponding benzyl substituted diacids. a phenyl glutaric acids and a phenyladipic acids can be made by the same procedure as a alkylglutaric acids and c al kyladipic acids except that in the first step phenyl iodide is used as the substituting agent instead of alkyl iodide. Alternatively, the phenyl substituted glutaric and adipic acids can be made by using the procedure described in Org. Syn. 16 1936 , 33 Coll.Vol. II 1943 , 288 incorporated by reference herein to prepare the diester of the first step. XB monosubstituted alkylglutaric acids can be prepared by the procedure described by Day et al., J. Chem. Soc. 117, p.1465 1920 , incorporated by reference herein. In this procedure cyanoacetamide is reacted with an aldehyde, followed by acid hydrolysis.EMI5.1 ss, ss dialkyl glutaric acids can be prepared by the procedure described by Handley et al., Aust. J. Chem., 13, p. 129 1960 , incorporated by reference herein. In this procedure, ethylcyanoacetate is reacted with a dialkyl ketone in the presence of ammonia, followed by acid hydrolysis. EMI6.1 ss alkyladipic acids can be prepared by the procedure described by Goheen et al., J. Org. Chem., 53, p. 891 1958 , incorporated by reference herein. In this procedure an acyl chloride is reacted with phenol in the presence of aluminum chloride to form the ortho and para acylsubstituted phenol. The para isomer is then isolated by distillation and subjected toClemenson reduction in the presence of Zn HCI to convert the acyl phenol to the corresponding alkyl phenol. The alkyl phenol is then converted to the corresponding alkyl cyclohexanol by reduction with hydrogen. The alkyl cyclohexanol is then oxidized by nitric acid in the presence of ammonium vanadate to form the ss alkyladipic acid.EMI7.1 The substituted diperoxy acids of the invention are conveniently employed as the primary bleaching agent in the form of particulate solids in granular or powder formulations containing diluents and stabilizers which retard the loss of available oxygen which can occur due to exothermic decomposition when exposed to elevated temperatures, or catalytic decomposition when exposed to heavy metal ions. Suitable stabilizers to prevent exothermic decomposition of these compounds are those which are capable of liberating moisture at a temperature below the decomposition of the particular substituted diperoxyacid compound. A wide variety of exotherm control materials can be used and include hydrated materials, such as potassium aluminum sulfate dodecahydrate, magnesium sulfate heptahydrate, sodium aluminum sulfate dodecahydrate, magnesium ammonium sulfate hexahydrate, and acids, such as boric acid. Boric acid is the preferred exotherm stabilizer SeeU.S. Pat. 4,100,095, Hutchins, issued July 11, 1978, incorporated by reference herein . Suitable stabilizers to prevent catalytic decomposition of the instant compounds in the presence of heavy metals, for example, iron and copper, are chelating agents. Suitable chelating agents are alkali metal polyphophates such as tetrasodium pyrophosphate and sodium acid pyrophosphate, 8 hydroxyquinoline, ethylenediamine tetra acetic acid, 1 hydroxy ethylidene diphosphonic acid, aminotri methylene phosphonic acid , phosphoric acid and mixtures thereof. Phosphoric acid or a mixture of phosphoric acid and terasodium pyrophosphate is preferred. In addition to the chelating agents and exotherm control agents mentioned above, coating materials can also be used to extend the shelf life of dry formulations containing the substituted diperoxyacid compounds of this invention as the primary bleaching agent. Suitable coating materials include a wide variety of fatty acids, fatty alcohols, derivatives thereof, such as esters and ethers, derivatives of polyethylene glycols, such as esters and ethers, hydrocarbon oils and waxes. These materials not only aid in preventing moisture from reaching the diperoxyacid compound, but can also be used to segregate the diperoxyacid from other agents which may be present in the formulation and adversely affect the stability of the diperoxyacid. Coating of the diperoxyacid particles with a surfactant such as the alkali metal salt of an alkylbenzene sulfonate having from 10 to 14 carbon atoms in the alkyl group, a C9 C22 alkyl sulfonate or a Cg C22 alkyl sulfate, can be employed to improve the water solubility properties of the diperoxyacid particles. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 4,126,573, Johnson, issued November 21, 1978, incorporated by reference herein. A diluent is optionally employed as a processing aid with the diperoxyacids herein to adjust the concentration of the peroxyacid and to facilitate handling, shipping and subsequent addition to the wash water, or to facilitate blending the diperoxyacid with additional detergent materials such as surfactants, builders, antistatic agents, coloring agents, bleach activators, perfumes and the like to form granular detergent bleach compositions. The diluent or processing aid can conveniently be used in an amount to provide a formulation containing from about 30 to 60 percent by weight of the active diperoxyacid acid, from about 1 to 5 percent by weight chelating agent, from about 15 to 55 percent by weight exotherm control agent. A preferred diluent is sodium sulfate, which is compatible with the diperoxyacids and stabilizers, as well as with ingredients in detergent formulations. Compositions containing the diperoxyacids of the invention should contain as little free moisture as possible, since presence of free moisture is detrimental to storage stability of the diperoxyacids. Preferably, the moisture level should be less than 1 of the composition. In the bleaching of fabrics with the peroxyacids of the present invention, the fabrics are contacted with an aqueous solution containing an amount of the peroxyacid sufficient to provide at least about 2 ppm and preferably from about 6 to about 20 ppm available oxygen in the solution. The invention will be further illustrated by the following examples.
