## Description
ENCAPSULATING WASTES The present invention relates to a process for encapsulating hazardous wastes. It is known to encapsulate various hazardous wastes by incorporating the waste into a fluid material which is then allowed to set to a solid so as to bind the waste. This enables the waste to be handled more easily and prevents hazardous components of the waste escaping to the environment. Thus it is known from British patent specification 1 116 319 to incorporate radio active wastes in bitumen, cement or a polymerisable resin. If bitumen is used the waste must be subjected to the elevated temperatures used to melt the bitumen. This is not always desirable and the requirement for a heating step leads to additional complications.The use of bitumen is not very suitable for wet wastes because the elevated temperature will lead to the evolution of steam which may carry with it hazardous components of the waste and because bitumen is hydrophobic. The use of cement as an encapsulating agent is not very satisfactory as the time required for the cement to set is usually undesirably long. The resulting product is friable and does not retain its structural integrity. British patent specification 938 211 discloses a process for solidifying or encapsulating an aqueous radio active waste by mixing the waste with a finely divided hydraulically setting absorption material e.g. Portland Cement. After the hydraulically setting absorbtion material has set the resulting dry block is then impregnated with a self hardening synthetic or casting resin e.g. Palatal P6 sold by BASF. This is a mixture of unsaturated polyester and styrene and as is well known in the polyester art such resins are cured by the action of conventional organic peroxide curing agents. The process is an impregnation process and is clearly only applicable to a block which has set and is free from water as otherwise the resin will not penetrate the block. Pressure is required for the impregnation process and it will be difficult to obtain satisfactory penetration of the resin into the core of the block. The speed of the encapsulation process is dependent on the setting time of the hydraulic filler. The specification mentions setting times of 2 days.The process is thus not a very satisfactory method of encapsulating wastes. Among the polymerisable resins which have been suggested for the encapsulation of wastes are unsaturated polyester resins. ThusBritish patent specification 1 353 121 discloses the encapsulation of a radio active waste in the form of a dry powder using a mixture of 1 an unsaturated polyester prepared from maleic and phthalic anhydride reacted with propylene glycol and 2 a copolymerisabie monomer e.g. styrene. Polymerisation is initiated by an initiator such as methyl ethyl ketone peroxide. While most unsaturated polyester resin systems are not intended to be used in the presence of water there is a well known method of using unsaturated polyester resins in the presence of water, namely in the production of a so called WEP or water extended polyester. This is described in an article by R.E.Carpenter in Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Technology 15, 375 1971 . WEPs are produced by dispersing water into the unsaturated polyester resin under conditions of high shear to form an emulsion of water in resin. The polymerisation initiators used are organic peroxides. The use of WEPs to encapsulate hazardous wastes is disclosed in a paper entitled Polyester Encapsulation of Hazardous IndustrialWastes by R.V. Subramanian et al., presented at the NationalConference on Treatment and Disposal of Industrial Waste Waters andResidues Houston Texas, April 26 28 1977. British patent specification 1 479 150 also discloses the encapsulation of wet wastes specifically radio active ion exchange resins using an unsaturated polyester resin. The specification does not specifically state that a WEP was used but this would be apparent to a person skilled in the art in view of the reference to a methyl ethyl ketone cobalt naphthenate initiator activator system. The use of WEPs to encapsulate wastes has a number of disadvantages. The requirement for high shear to create an emulsion or dispersion means that special expensive mixing equipment is required.There can be difficulties in obtaining a solid product in a reasonable length of time. This is because it is important to avoid an excessive temperature rise within the material being polymerised due to exothermic nature of the polymerisation reaction. Thus if waste material is being cast into a block it is important to prevent the temperature at the centre of the block rising excessively while the material sets as stresses may be produced which will cause cracking of the block. There may also be undesirable evolution of vapours from the block. Certain wastes subjected to high temperature will swell or disintegrate. An excessive temperature rise can be avoided by using low concentrations of initiator and activator but the setting time is then undesirably long Associated with the problem of heat evolution is the problem of scale up.A WEP type polyester resin formulation which is suitable for use in small scale tests may be completely unsatisfactory when attempts are made to cast large blocks. A fnrmulation which is suitable for use with a waste with a given water content may be unsatisfactory when used with a waste with a different water content. There has been a long felt want for a method of encapsulating hazardous wastes, particularly radio active wastes but the methods previously proposed have had considerable disadvantages. According to the present invention the process for encapsulating a hazardous waste by allowing to set an encapsulation mixture containing an unsaturated polyester an ethylenically unsaturated monomer copolymerisable with said polyester, and an initiator,which mixture incorporates the hazardous waste, is characterised in that the mixture contains a hydraulic filler, the initiator is an initiator which is activated by aqueous alkaline conditions and setting takes place under aqueous alkaline conditions. The process of the present invention may be applied to a variety of wastes providing that they do not interfere with setting reaction to any substantial extent. Thus the process may be applied to wastes containing toxic heavy metals or mercury, or organochlorine compounds.It is particularly useful for the encapsulation of radioactive wastes.The wastes may be pieces of contaminated equipment or clothing, but the process is particularly suitable for the encapsulation of particulate wastes. The wastes may be dry in which case water must be added to the mixture to cause it to set. The process is particularly suitable for the treatment of wet particulate radio active wastes which are usually difficult to handle by alternative methods.The quantity of water present in the waste may, for example, be in the range 20 to 60 by weight of waste, preferably below 50 by weight. The process of the present invention is particularly suitable for the encapsulation of wet ion exchange resins both anionic and cationic. Other wet solid wastes to which the process of the invention may be applied are molecular sieves, graphite, sand and aluminosilicates, Magnox sludges sludges containing magnesium hydroxide mixed with magnesium carbonate filtration sludges. The process of the present invention may also be used to encapsulate wastes in the form of aqueous solutions. It will be necessary to use sufficient hydraulic filler to bind all the water on setting. Unsaturated polyesters and ethylenically unsaturated monomers copolymerisable with the polyesters are well known to those skilled in the art. A description of suitable polyesters is found in British patent 1 065 053 Cement Marketing Company , the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference. It is preferred to use a mixture which gels in 30 to 90 minutes, for example one which gels in less thanl hour. Mixtures gelling in the range 10 to 30 minutes can be used however and a standard polyester made from a mixture of an ether glycol and a non ether glycol e.g. from diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol, may be used together with a metal accelerator e.g. copper naphthenate, a reducing agent e.g sodium metabisulphite and a soap emulsifier. Alternatively an unsaturated polyester may be used which is inherently more reactive e.g. an unsaturated polyester produced from one or more glycols which are substantially all ether glycol in which case metal accelerators and reducing agents are not required. The hydraulic filler may be any substance which on mixing with water at ambient temperature reacts to form a crystalline lattice structure exhibiting a degree of mechanical stability and or physical strength. Examples of hydraulic fillers are gypsum, calcium sulphate hemihydrate plaster of Paris , and pulverised fuel ash.The alkaline conditions required to activate the initiator may be provided by the addition of a substance which is not a hydraulic filler. However in a preferred embodiment of the invention, the substance which produces the alkaline conditions also acts as a hydraulic filler, and it is preferred to use an alkaline reacting hydraulic cement. Examples of hydraulic cements are high alumina cements, blast furnace cements, lime pozzolana cement. It is preferred however to use mixtures containing Portland cement. ThePortland cement may be substantially the only hydraulic filler present in the mixture. Alternatively it may be desirable to use mixtures of Portland cement with other fillers e.g. pulverised fuel ash.The Portland cement content in such mixtures may be from 6 to 95 by weight of total hydraulic filler, but is more preferably greater than 10 by weight, in particularly greater than 20 by weight. The initiator used in the process of the present invention is one which is activated by aqueous alkaline conditions, which distinguishes it from the organic peroxides usually used in polyester moulding compositions. It is preferred to use a water soluble salt of a per acid, in particular salts of persulphuric acid, e.g.ammonium, sodium and potassium persulphate. It is particularly preferred to use ammonium persulphate. The quantity of initiator used will depend on the speed of gelling required. Examples of suitable amounts are those in the range 1 to 5 by weight of the encapsulation mixture. The quantity of waste incorporated in the encapsulation mixture may vary over a wide range. For economic reasons it is desirable to incorporate a large quantity of waste into the mixture. However an excessive amount of waste may lead to a reduction in the physical strength of the final product obtained. The man skilled in the art will be able to determine by simple tests the maximum amount of waste which can be incorporated consistent with his requirements for the physical strength and integrity of the final product. Thus the quantity of waste may be 30 to 60 of the total weight of encapsulation mixture and waste and is preferably more than 40 by weight of the total. It is preferred to use sufficient quantity of encapsulation mixture to prevent the appearance of excess water on the surface of the set product, when treating a wet waste. The relative proportions of unsaturated polyester, ethylenically unsaturated monomer and hydraulic filler may vary over a wide range.For example suitable compositions may contain 50 to 70 parts of polyester resin, 25 to 65 parts of unsaturated monomer and 80 to 150 parts of hydraulic filler and 3 to 5 parts of initiator. Where the waste does not contain water it will be necessary to add it so as to cause the encapsulation mixture to set. Even if some water is present in the waste it may be desirable to add additional water. The quantity of water initially present may for example be at least 50 by weight of the hydraulic filler. If the dry encapsulation mixture is prepared in advance of the encapsulation step it may be desirable to add fumaric acid to stabilise it. It may be desirable to add non ionic surfactants.The addition of fatty acids to control pot life i.e. the time for which the mixture remains fluid after water is added and give ease of dispersion of the encapsulation mixture after prolonged storage may be useful. The quantities of waste, hydraulic filler unsaturated polyester and copolymerisable monomer are preferably such as give a product which has a specific gravity of at least 1.2. This is important if the encapsulated material is to be disposed of by dumping in the ocean. The encapsulation mixtures of the present invention may be prepared by simple low speed mixing apparatus without the necessity see GB 1 098 132, GB 1 091 325, OB 1 092, 747 . of using expensive high shear mixers such as are used in the production of WEPs water extended polyesters . If the waste is particulate it may be introduced into the mixing apparatus with the other ingredients. The mixture is then discharged into a mould in which it is allowed to set. For non particulate waste e.g. pieces of machinery, encapsulation mixture may be fed to the mould, the waste added and the mould may then be filled with additional encapsulation mixture. After the mixture has set to a sufficient extent it may be removed from the mould. The resulting moulded block may then be if required be inserted into a protective container and disposed of by dumping. Alternatively the mould in which the block is formed may act also as a container. The invention will now be illustrated by reference to the following Examples. In these Examples three different polyester resins were used.Polyester Resin A Condensation product of phthalic anhydride, maleic anhydride, 1,2 propylene glycol and diethylene glycol in mole ratios 2 1 2.18 1.18 dissolved in styrene to give a 70 solution by weight. Polyester Resin B Condensation product of phthalic anhydride, maleic anhydride and diethylene glycol in mole ratios 1 1 2.2 dissolved in styrene to give a 60 solution by weight.Polyester Resin C Similar to polyester resin A except this was processed to a higher viscosity and contained less inhibitors. Example 1 Polyester resin A 60 parts by weight was mixed at ambient temperature with a hydraulic cement 40 parts by weight sold under the name Hydracrete ammonium persulphate 2 parts by weight , sodium metabisulphate 0.5 parts by weight , copper naphthenate equivalent to 5 ppm copper and liquid soap 1.0 parts by weight . Ion exchange resin 50 parts by weight containing about 47 by weight of water was then mixed in and the mixture was allowed to set in a mould. The mixture gelled in 11 minutes and had set sufficiently to allow the block of encapsulated ion exchange resin to be removed from the mould in 2 to 3 hours.Example 2 A composition was made by mixing together at ambient temperature polyester resin C, Portland cement and ammonium persulphate in the proportions shown in Table 1. Waste in the form of wet ion exchange resin 75 grams containing 47 by weight of water was added to the mixture and cast in a mould.The mixture in the mould gelled in 30 minutes and readily demoulded in 2 to 3 hours showing no signs of separated water.Example 3 This was carried out in the same way as Example 2 except that potassium persulphate was used in place of ammonium persulphate.The mixture in the mould gelled in 11 hours and was readily demoulded in 6 to 7 hours showing no significant signs of separated water.Comparative Tests A, B and C These were comparative tests not according to the invention and were carried out as Example 2 except that cumene hydroperoxide paramenthane hydroperoxide and methyl ethyl ketone peroxide respectively were used in place of ammonium persulphate. The mixture in the mould thickened over a period of 4 to 6 hours without properly gelling. Overnight a sticky uncured soft mass was produced showing large quantities of free water and liquid polyester resin.
