# Catalyst compositions and their use in the preparation of release coatings.

## Abstract
A catalyst composition comprising a solution of an organometallic complex of platinum or rhodium in a liquid allyl ether which has a b.p. of at least 150 C at 1 bar and which is free from groups having an adverse effect on the catalytic affect of the complex polyorganosiloxane coat ing compositions containing a Si H polysiloxane and a polysiloxane containing Si OH, Si vinyl or Si allyl groups, an organometaliic complex of platinum or rhodium and an allyl ether as defined above and the use of the composi tions for preparing release coatings on substrates. In the coating of substrates, especially paper, with release coatings based on heat curable polysiloxane com positions, organo metallic complexes of platinum or rho dium can be used as catalysts provided they are dissolved in the composition. The low boiling solvents hitherto used have disadvantages in causing atmospheric pollution and requiring solvent recovery plant. The ethers defined can be uses in place of the low boiling solvents to give satis factory coatings without the mentioned disadvantages.
