# A calorimeter vessel, a control system therefor, and a calorimeter system comprising a plurality of calorimeter vessels.

## Abstract
A calorimeter vessel 10 includes a base 80 for supporting a bomb 12 thereon and a downwardly concave ly opening container 40 sealably engaging the base 50 . The base 50 includes a water supply system permitting a common water supply 14 to supply water to three such vessels which include water level detecting sensors 23, 25 also permitting automatic filling of the vessels. In the preferred embodiment the vessel 10 is filled in two stages providing rapid yet precise filling of each of the vessels. In one embodiment of the invention a microprocessor control circuit is employed for sampling temperature data within each of the vessels during an analysis to ascertain beginning and ending temperatures and for calculating the resultant heat of combustion of a sample. The microprocessor also is employed to automatically control the filling and emptying of the vessel 10 and the firing of the sample containing calorimeter bomb 12 .
