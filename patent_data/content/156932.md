# Gas treating process.

## Abstract
A process is disclosed for treating particle containing gas streams by removing particles and gaseous atmospher ic pollutants. Parallel passage contactors are utilized to remove the gaseous pollutants. The minimum required gas flow rate for effective operation of these contactors is main tained by recycling a variable amount of low temperature gas which has been passed through a particle removal zone. The recycled gas is reheated by heat exchange against a portion of the treated gas.
