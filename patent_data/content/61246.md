# Low crosstalk ribbon cable.

## Abstract
Several embodiments of reduced crosstalk ribbon cable 30, 60, 90 having alternating twisted 32, 62, 92 and straight 34, 64, 94 sections of indefinite length are disclosed, crosstalk being reduced by differing starting positions of alternate twisted pairs, differing lay of alternate twisted pairs, and variations in lay along the length of alternate twisted pairs. A preferred embodiment 30 uses offset starting positions 44, 48 , and a lay in alternate twisted pairs substantially longer than that of adjacent pairs, becoming shorter to minimize the nontwisted portion resulting from the time to bring adjacent pairs into planar alignment. An apparatus for making such cable is also disclosed, having several wire supply twisters 118, 120 and several second twisters 122, 124 , removing the twist inserted by the wire supply twisters 118, 120 , allowing indefinitely long twisted sections 32, 62, 92 . Twisters 118, 120, 122, 124 are provided in two groups operating in opposite directions, preventing curl of the cable. The paired conductors are maintained in precisely laterally spaced relationship by heat bonding to thermoplastic film 130, 132 .
