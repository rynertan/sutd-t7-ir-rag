# Two stage system for catalytic conversion of olefins with distillate and gasoline modes.

## Abstract
An improved process for converting an olefinic feedstock containing ethylene and C 3 olefins to produce a heavy hyd rocarbon product rich in distillate by contacting the feedstock with an oligomerization catalyst bed, at elevated pressure and temperature conditions in operating mode favorable to for mation of heavy distillate product by selective conversion of C 3alkenes. The improvement comprises providing a distillate mode effluent stream containing substantially unconverted ethylene in vapor phase and condensed distillate, and recov ering unconverted ethylene rich hydrocarbon vapor from the distillate mode effluent stream and further converting such to olefinic gasoline in a second oligomerization catalyst bed at reduced moderate pressure and elevated temperature condi tions in operating mode favorable to formation of C 6 olefinic gasoline. At least a portion of the olefinic gasoline is recycled for conversion with the feedstock in the distillate mode catal yst bed. Gasoline and distillate mode effluent streams may be fractionated to recover a light hydrocarbon stream rich in C 3 aliphatic hydrocarbons for recycling at least a portion of the light hydrocarbon stream to dilute the ethene rich vapor in the second gasoline mode catalyst bed.
