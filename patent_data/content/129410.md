# Backflow check valve.

## Abstract
A backflow check valve 20 is disclosed. The valve com prises a housing 22, a biasable disk 24 within the housing and a valve seat 36 carried by the housing against which the disk 24 is urgeable. The housing has a fluid inlet 34 and a fluid outlet 32. The disk is preferably disposed transverse to a preselected direction of fluid flow through the housing for controlling fluid flow therethrough. The disk 24 is urgeable aginst the seat 36 for preventing fluid from flowing contrary to the preselected direction of flow. The housing 22 includes first 30 and second 36 disk biasing means for engaging opposite sides of said disk 24 in such a manner that said disk is clamped to said seat 36 along a first pair of spaced opposite portions by a blade 30 and said disk is engageable with said seat 36 along a second pair of spaced opposite portions 77. The blade 30 has an edge 52 insertable into the nadir 48 of a concave cylindrical valley forming the seat 36 to trap the disk 24. The disk 24 can deflect more easily when held along a diameter than if biased into a partially spherical shape.
