# CAPACITOR IGNITION SYSTEM

## Abstract
A capacitor ignition system of magnet type comprises a charging winding 10 , a trigger winding 11 , an ignition coil 13 and an ignition switch 14 with electronic control means, in this case a micro processor 16 . For practical, economical reasons the voltage of the charging winding cannot be used for current supply to the electronic control means as this voltage as this voltage is several hundred volts. In the trigger winding the chosen voltage can be a few volts which is a proper voltage for the control means. The trigger winding of the invention has double functions to generate a reference voltage for spark release triggering and to be an energy source for the electronic control means.
