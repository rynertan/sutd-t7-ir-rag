# A flexible damped bearing assembly.

## Abstract
A flexible damped bearing assembly for securing a rotating shaft 10 maintained within a bearing is disclosed. An annular damper 20 formed from a resilient material includes an axial bore for receiving the bearing and shaft 10 . The damper 20 is additionally slotted to define damper arms 24 extending outwardly therefrom. Damper pads 26 are used in conjunction with the damper arms 24 to define pivot points about which the damper arms 24 are displaced on the application of force to the damper 20 . A damping fluid is provided between the slots 34 and the exterior surface of the damper 20 and a retainer structure 50 such that numerous damping locations are provided. The damper arms 24 are further defined to provide a spring force which may be tuned as required. This combination provides a compact bearing assembly capable of supporting a shaft 10 while damping vibratory oscillations.
