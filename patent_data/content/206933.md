# Reversal image development type electrophotographic printing system.

## Abstract
A reversal image development type electrophotograph ic printing system including a rotatable drum 1 coated with a light sensitive layer and an image developing roller 31 co rotatable with the drum and using a printing medium com posed of carriers and toner. To prevent superfluous toner during start up, a predetermined bias voltage differing to a normal bias voltage is supplied to the image developing rol ler and the drum, and the image developing roller, a prechar ger 2 , and power supplies 52, 53 for supplying the initial and normal bias voltages are energized in a predetermined start sequence. In addition, to prevent carrier extraction at a stop condition, the drum, the image developing roller, the precharger, and the power supply 53 are deenergized in a predetermined operation stop sequence. A printing medium including a resin toner comprising a mixed resin and magnetized powder and a charge control medium mixed with the resin toner may be used, and preven tion of the surplus resin toner extraction in the start up con dition also may be achieved.
