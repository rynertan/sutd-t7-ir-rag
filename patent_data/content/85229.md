# Box spring assembly.

## Abstract
A box spring assembly which includes a generally rectangular frame 12 , a welded wire grid 42 , disposed above and aligned with the frame, a plurality of upwardly extending limited deflection wire springs 50 , which are mounted at their lower ends on the frame and at their upper ends are secured to the welded wire grid, and corner springs 80 , which are yieldable and are supported on the corners of the frame so as to support the corners of the grid. Each of the limited deflection springs 50 is formed at its upper end with an attaching portion 54 , that is readily secured to the grid by conventional clips 74 , and includes wire sections 58, 60 , which provide additional spaced supports for the grid. Improved cross rails 20 in the frame support the springs and improved corner springs 80 support the corners of the grid.
