# Field sensitive display device.

## Abstract
A field sensitive display device for forming a display when subjected to visible light comprises a field sensitive material 22, 152 , first and second spaced electrodes 14A, 14B 114A,. 114B each of the spaced electrodes being disposed in a different plane spaced apart from one another for inducing a field therebetween, means 16, 20 for containing the field sensitive material and the spaced electrodes with the field sensitive material being relatively disposed between the spaced electrodes in order that a field induced by the spaced electrodes across the field sensitive material is capable of affecting the field sensitive material, a first 14A, 114A of the spaced electrodes including an elongated impedance element 24A, 124A and a plurality of elongated conductive, substantially low impedance portions 28 spaced with respect to one another along their length, the plurality of low impedance portions being connected to different electrical locations disposed along the length of the impedance element and extending therefrom, first terminal means 30A, 31A connected to the ends of the elongated impedance element for applying a first electrical signal thereto, a second 14B, 114B of the spaced electrodes including an elongated impedance element 24B, 124B and a plurality of elongated, conductive, substantially low impe dance portions 28 spaced with respect to one another along their length, the plurality of low impedance portions being connected to different electrical locations disposed along the length of the impedance element and extending therefrom, and a second terminal means 30B, 31B connected to the second electrode for applying a second electrical signal thereto.
