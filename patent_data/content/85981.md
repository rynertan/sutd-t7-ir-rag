# Method of and apparatus for determining the refractive index profile of optical fibres and optical fibre preforms.

## Abstract
The invention allows the refractive index profile to be obtained by phase difference measurements. A Zeeman effect laser 1 generates a light beam of plane waves comprising two radiations with slightly different frequencies. The beam is split into the component radiations 2d, 2e the beats between the first radiation, which is made to follow a path outside the fibre or preform 6 , and the second radiation, which is made to follow a path crossing the fibre or preform 6 , are generated by a photodetector the phase differences between said beats and a reference beat are measured, and the refractive index profile is obtained from the phase difference values by suitable computing means.
