# KEY CONTROLLED METHOD FOR INVOKING AUTOMATIC ROW AND COLUMN ADDITION IN AN INTERACTIVE TEXT PROCESSING SYSTEM

## Abstract
A method is disclosed for assisting the operator of an interactive text processing system to add a list of numbers that have been entered into the system during the creation of a document 40 49 . The method involves the operator positioning the cursor 44, 45 adjacent the first number in the sequence by operating the cursor move keys. The next step 46 involves the operator pressing and holding either the column add or the row add function key while watching the movement of the cursor from the first number in the sequence to succeeding numbers in the sequence until the cursor is positioned adjacent the last number in the sequence, at which time the function key is released. The last step 47 in the process is for the operator to press the Enter key which enters the total into the system for subse quent processing and displays the total in the appropriate location on the display. The provision in the system for the operator to total a sequence of displayed numbers by means of a function key which is made typamatic greatly enhances operator efficiency and system throughput.
