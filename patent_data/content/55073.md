# Improvements in or relating to electronic clock generators.

## Abstract
A clock generator for producing a two phase output com prises a bistable circuit having two stages 10, 11. The output of each stage is cross coupled to the input of the other and each cross coupling path includes a high resistance transfer gate 18, 20. Each transfer gate forms part of an RC delay element which is so arranged that at a transition of clock signals the output of one of the stages completes its transition substan tially at the same time as the output of the other stage begins its transition. This results in non overlapping outputs from the generator.
