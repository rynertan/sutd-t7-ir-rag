# Gauging method and apparatus for components having leads.

## Abstract
The field of the invention concerns handling electrical components 10 12, 10 min 12 min of the type having a body 10, 10 min and multiple rows of leads 12, 12 min protruding out through one surface. The purpose of the invention is of straightening the leads of the components sufficiently for insertion into corresponding holes of a circuit board, as well as for testing the electrical functioning or physical integrity of the electrical component. According to the invention, such an handling method consists of steps for each component of straightening each lead 12, 12 min of said component which is bent from said axis 130 along at least a portion of a length thereof and testing 30, 31 electrical functioning of said component 10 12, 10 min 12 min during said straightening. A peculiar use of the invention can be found in the handling of square modules .
