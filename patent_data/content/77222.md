# Bypass control system.

## Abstract
In a fluid catalytic cracking process in the case of a catalyst load dump the catalyst laden gas is prevented from passing through the power recovery expander. This is achieved by establishing a tangential, low pressure bypass flow path in the supply line to the expander which causes the catalyst to be bypassed. An optical sensor 130 senses the catalyst load dump and causes the actuation of the valve 280 necessary to establish the low pressure bypass flow path.
