# Laundry spreading apparatus.

## Abstract
A system for spreading laundry articles for laying on the conveyor of an automatic feeding machine has two carriages 2,3 which carry clipping mechanisms 1 for gripping the corners of the articles, a track 4 which carries the carriages 2,3 and an endless belt 5 which drives the carriages 2,3 . Only one of the carriages is positively fixed to the belt 5 . The other carriage floats with respect to the belt 5 and is engaged by abutment of an anchor boss 9 fixed on the opposite run of the belt to the first carriage. This allows spreading and centering from a loading station at the sides of the machine.
