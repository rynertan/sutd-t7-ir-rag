# Circuit for DC testing of logic circuits.

## Abstract
Logic circuits such as cascode circuits can be DC tested for normally untestable defects, such as emitter shorts or collector opens, by applying to the output of the circuit lines 16, 17 , or portion of the circuit, under test an additional voltage at 50, 51 through an impedance. The specific em bodiment teaches a resistor 42, 43 and diode 44, 45 in series as the impedance.
