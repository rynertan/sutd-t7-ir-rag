# Single piece pre shaped anchor bolt.

## Abstract
A one piece wall anchor capable of being driven axially into a hole 10 drilled in masonry 11 to cause the inserted anchor to lodge securely therein to hold a fixture 12 or other part against the masonry surface. The anchor is constituted by a shank 13 formed of resilient material whose memory is such that when the shank is forcibly deformed, it seeks to maintain its original shape, the shank 13 , being integral with a drivable head 15 and having a maximum cross section which is substantially equal to the diameter of the hole 10 . The shank 13 is pre shaped to include at least one undulation which deviates from the longitudinal axis X passing through the head 15 to create a shank bend having a peak P on one side of the shank and upper B2 and lower bases Bi on the other side thereof. When, therefore, the anchor is driven into the masonry hole 10 , this force seeks to straighten out the bend, the resultant deformation thereof exerting outward pressures against large contact areas on the wall of the hole at the peak P and at the bases of B1,B2 of the bend, which multilevel pressures strongly resist axial withdrawal of the shank 13 .
