## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTION PROCESSES FOR THE PRODUCTION OF ANTIBIOTIC 1 OXADETHIACEPHALOSPORINSDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a process for preparing l oxadethiacephalosporins I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters which are useful as antibiotics via ring closure of 4 3 carboxy 3 diazo 2 oxapropyloxy 3 acylamino azetidin 2 ones II EMI1.1 wherein R1 is H or SOCH A is H or acyl andR3 is an organic functional group known in the relevant art as in this connection see U.S. Patents 4,226,866 ., issued October 7, 1980, and 4,138,486 issued Feb. 6,1979,respectively. which are incorporated herein by reference to the extent that they define I anu its utility EMI2.1 wherein A and R1 are as defined above and R is a removable protecting group. Compounds containing the oxacephalosporin nucleus of the formulaEMI2.2 are known as antibiotics having a broad range of anti bacterial activity, and there have been reported various methods of synthetizing the oxacephalosporin nucleus. However, all of these prior schemes are multi step and inefficient. We, the present inventors, have made extensive researches in an attempt to provide a process of forming the oxacephalosporin nucleus which is free from the drawbacks of the prior art methods. As a result, we have succeeded to synthetize a new compound, carboxyl protected 4 3 carboxy 3 diazo 2 oxapropyloxy 3 acylamino azetidine 2 one represented by the formula II EMI3.1 wherein A is an acyl group such as alkanoyl group or aroyl group and R2 is a carboxyl protecting group, and we have discovered that when the compound of the formula I1 is reacted with such a substance hereinafter referred to as a carbene producing catalyst which is capable of converting into carbene the 3 carbon atom present in the side chain attaching to the 4 position of the compound II , this compound undergoes the ring closure in such a way that the aiazo group N2 existing in the compound II is liberated, the 3 carbon atoms is converted into the carbene and then bonded to the nitrogen atom at the l position of the azetidinone nucleus of the compound II . On the basis of these findings, this invention is achieved. As previously mentioned the definition of the acyl group A is incorporated by reference from the above cited U.S.Patents. Additionally, A is defined to be all acyl functional groups known to be effective in the related ss lactam antibiotic art which are characterized by anN acyl moiety. Also incorporated by reference is U.S.Patent 4,174,316, issued 13 November 1979, which describes the synthesis of homotienamycin I from the carbon analogue II of the above described diazo intermediate II EMI4.1 while homothienamycin may be considered a l carDadethiacephalosporin, the cited patent makes no disclosure relative to the instant 7 amido l oxadethiacephalosporins, or their synthesis. The definition of R in the cited patent is specifically incorporated herein. In accordance with the process of this invention, the ring closing reaction of the azetidinone derivative of the formula II is effected by treating with the carbene producing catalyst, and hence the new process of this invention is to form the oxacephalosporin nucleus by conducting the ring enlargement of the azetidinone compound in such a way that the ring closure takes place at the 4 5 bond of the oxacephalosporin nucleus.The process of this invention is unique in that the formation of the oxacephalosporin nucleus is performed by utilizing only the carbon atoms of the B lactam ring of the penicillin molecule which are essentially required to impart the necessary sterochemistry and the necessary antibacterial activity to the cephem ring, but without utilizing the other carbon atoms of the penicillin molecule than those of the lactam ring and by utilizing an adaitional compound to introduce externally the further carbon atoms which are required additionally to form the cepiiem ring, and also in that the ring closure is effected with involving the carbene producing reaction. There has never been any precedent where the carbene producing reaction is involved in the synthetic formation of the oxacephalosporin nucleus. According to the first aspect of this invention, there is provided a process for the production of a l oxa l dethia 3 hydroxycephalosporin derivative of the formulaEMI5.1 wherein A denotes an acyl group, RÚ denotes a hydrogen or a methoxy group and Rê denotes a carboxyl protecting group, characterized in that a diazo compound represented by the general formulaEMI5.2 wherein A, R1 and R2 are as defined above is ring closed by reacting it with a carbene producing catalyst.According to the second aspect of this invention, there is provided a process for the production of a l oxa l dethia 3 alkoxycephem compound of the general formula EMI6.1 wherein A denotes an acyl group, R1 denotes a hydrogen or a methoxy group, R2 denotes a carboxylprotecting group and R3 denotes a lower alkyl group, characterized in that a diazo compound represented by the general formulaEMI6.2 wherein A, R1 and R2 are as defined about is ring closed by reacting it with a carbene producing catalyst to produce the l oxa l dethia 3 hydroxycephalosporin derivative of the formulaEMI6.3 wherein A, R1 and R2 ae as defined above, and the 3 hydroxyl group of said derivative of the formula III is reacted with an alkylation reagent According to the third aspect of this invention, there is provided the compound of the general formula II shown hereinbefore, as the compound of the formula II is used as the starting compound in the processes of this invention and is a useful, new substance. Procedures for carrying out the processes of this invention are now described. In the diazo compound of the formula II which is employed as the starting compound in the processes of this invention, the acyl group A may be an alkanoyl group of the formula R4CO whereR4 is an alkyl group, particularly an alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms or an aroyl group of the formula R5CO where R5 is an aryl group, particularly phenyl group, optionally bearing an inert substituent such as nitro group which does not participate in the reaction or an aralkylcarbonyl group of the formula R6CO where R6 is an aralkyl group such as a phenyl lower alkyl group, especially benzyl group or a phenoxy lower alkyl group, especially phenoxymethyl group. Preferred examples of the acyl group A include benzoyl group, phenylacetyl group and phenoxyacetyl group. The group RÚ may be a hydrogen atom or a methoxy group. This methoxy group may preferably be in a position. The carboxyl group which is attaching to the 3 carbon atom of the diazo compound of the formula II needs to have been protected. For this protection, there may be selected a suitable one from any known carboxyl protecting group. Examples of the carboxyl protecting group R2 suitable for that purpose include an alkyl group such as t butyl, dichloroethyl and the like as well as an aralkyl group such as benzyl, p nitrobenzyl, p methoxybenzyl, phenacyl, diphenylmethyl and the like. It is preferable to select a carboxyl protecting group which can readily be removed either unaer weakly acidic conditions or under reduction conaitions. For instance, it is convenient to select a substituted or unsubstituted aralkyl group such as diphenylmethyl or p nitrophenylmethyl. In the processes according to the first and second aspects of this invention, the ring closing reaction of the diazo compound of the formula II is performed using a carbene producing catalyst, This catalyst may be, for example, rhodium acetate, rhodium oxide or silver oxide etc. Rhodium acetate is most preferred. This ring closure reaction may be conducted in such a manner that the starting compound II is dissolved in an organic solvent such as ethyl acetate, THF, dioxane and the like and the carbene producing catalyst is reacted with the compound II in the solution obtained. The reaction may be conducted preferably at a temperature of OOC to 1000C and more especially at a temperature of 300C to 700C for a period of 30 minutes to 1 hour. By the ring closure reaction stated above, there is produced the l oxa l dethia 3 hydroxycephalosporin derivative of the general formula III . This derivative is somewhat unstable and is hard to be isolated as such. The compound of the general formula III thus obtained is, without isolation thereof, alkylated in the process of the second aspect of this invention, whereby the 3 hydroxyl group of the compound III is converted into the alkoxyl group.To this end, a diazoalkane may usually be used as the alkylation reagent. The methylation reagent may be diazomethane and the ethylation reagent may be diazoethane, for example. This alkylation reagent may be reacted with the compound III in an organic solvent as mentioned above in a known manner. The reaction temperature may be in a range of OOC to 500C. In this way, the compound of the formula I is produced. If desired, the protected 4 carboxyl group COORê of the compound of the formula I may be subjected to a conventional deprotection method, for example, by weak acid hydrolysis, so that the protecting group R2 is removed therefrom. The compound of the general formula I thus obtained may be purified according to a conventional method for purifying the B lactam compounds. When the compound of the general formula I obtained by the second aspect of this invention contains a methoxy group as the group R , the acylamino group AHN is then existing in the a position. On the other hand, when the compound I contains hydrogen atom as R1, the aminoacyl group AHN may be existing either in the a position or in the ss position. The compound I containing a 3 acylamino group as the group AHN may be subjected to an acyl exchange reaction in a known manner, so that there is derived a useful substance having antibacterial activity, for example, such antibacterial substances as disclosed in Japanese patent application prepublication Kokai No.112895 78. The compound I containing an a acylamino group as the group AHN may be modified into antibacterial substances by transferring the a acylamino group into the 3 position in a known manner with concurrent a methoxylation at the 7 position of the compound I , followed by exchanging the resultant S acylamino group by another appropriate acylamino group. A method for preparing the diazo compound of the general formula II which is employed as the starting compound in the processes of this invention is now described. As demonstrated in Example 2 given later, the compound of the formula II can be prepared via a few stages with starting from the compound of the general formulaEMI10.1 wherein R is phenyl group, phenylmethyl group or phenoxymethyl group, R is hydrogen or methoxy group and M is an alkali metal, which is, in turn, synthetized by several stages using an oxazoline derivative and glycerine or hydroxyacetic acid alkylester as the inital materials.If the nature of the 3 acylamino group RCONH present in the compound IV is not consistent with the nature of the corresponding acylamino group AHN present in the starting diazo compound II to be employed in the processes of this invention, the compound IV may be subjected to an acyl exchange reaction in a known manner so as to introduce an appropriate acylamino group AHN thereinto and to give the compound of the formulaEMI11.1 Subsequently, the compound of the formula IV is converted into a corresponding free acid form by neutralization, followed by activation of the terminal carboxyl group of the side chain which is attaching to the 4 position of the compound IV . The activated carboxylic acid derivative so obtained of the compound IV is then reacted with two carbon atoms unit in such a manner that it is reacted with an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salt of malonic acid mono ester or acetate anion and the like, for example, whereby there is produced a compound represented by the general formulaEMI11.2 wherein A and R1 are as defined above and R2 is a carboxyl protecting group. Further, the compound V is reacted with an azide compound to give a diazo compound represented by the general formula EMI12.1 wherein A, R1 and R2 are as defined above. In the above mentioned stages for the preparation of the starting compound, the reaction stages of preparing the compound V from the compound IV may be conducted by so called one pot system, in such a way that the compound IV in solution in an organic solvent such as acetonitrile,THF and the like is firstly converted into the free acid form by neutralization with a mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid etc. and the terminal carboxyl group of the side chain at the 4 position of the compound IV but in the free acid form is then converted into the activated carboxylic acid derivative. For the activation of the terminal carboxyl group, there may be applied any known procedure such as the mixed acid anhydride method, the acid halide method, the active imidazolide method and the like. When the activation of the terminal carboxyl group is conducted using carbonyl diimidazole, for example, the free acid form of the compound IV may be reacted with carbonyl diimidazole at a temperature of OOC to 50C for a period of 1 to 2 hours. The carboxyl activated form of the compound IV so obtained is then subjected to the two carbon atoms extension reaction in solution in the organic solvent mentioned above to produce the compound of the formula V .For the two carbon atoms extension reaction to produce the compound V , there is used a two carbon atomsextension reagent such as the anion of malonic acid mono ester, acetate anion, Meldrum s acid derivative anion and the like. This reaction may preferably be carried out at a temperature of 5 to 200C for a period of 3 to 4 hours. I the subsequent stage where the compound of the general formula V is converted into the diazo compound of the general formula VI this dizaotization reaction may be conducted using an azide compound. To this end, the azide compound may suitably be an aromatic sulfonic acid azide of the formulaEMI13.1 wherein R7 is a hydrogen, carboxyl group or an alkyl group of 1 to 9 carbon atoms. A most preferred one is the azide of the formula VII where R7 is carboxyl group.This diazotization is carried out in such a manner that the compound of the general formula V is dissolved in an organic solvent such as acetonitrile, dioxane, THF and the like, the resultant solution is admixed with the diazotization reagent of the formula VII and the reaction is effected at a temperature of OOC to 300C under stirring, followed by dropwise addition of an organic base such as triethylamine, dimethylaniline and the like to complete the reaction. The processes of this invention are now illustrated with reference to the following Examples, to which this invention is not limited.
