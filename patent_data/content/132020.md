# Method and apparatus for reducing field filter cake on sponge cores.

## Abstract
A well coring apparatus 10 includes an outer barrel 12 and an inner barrel 18 . The inner barrel 18 is sealed with a rupturable diaphragm 24 and a check valve 49 . A sponge 50 is disposed around the inner walls of the inner barrel 19 for contacting the core 58 . A fluid 54 is disposed in the sealed inner barrel 18 to prewet the sponge 50 . A piercer 32 is reciprocally disposed within the outer barrel 12 and has a conical shaped surface 38 , the apex of which is oper able to pierce the diaphragm 24 . In response to forming of the core 58 , the fluid 54 displaced by the core 58 prevents drilling mud from being disposed between the core 58 and the sponge 50 .
