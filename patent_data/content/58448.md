# Transconductance amplifier.

## Abstract
A transconductance amplifier includes a differential transconductance amplifier stage 10, 11 and a differential correction amplifier stage 18, 19 . In order to achieve substantially linear operation over a wide dynamic range, the effects of nonlinearities in the transconductance amplifier stage are substantially cancelled by the effects of nonlineari ties in the correction amplifier stage. This is accomplished by cross coupling the two stages and establishing the relative gain of the correction amplifier stage with respect to the transconductance amplifier stage such that the desired cancellation occurs. In a preferred embodiment, optimum cancellation occurs when the gain of the correction amplifier stage is substantially one half the gain of the transconduct ance amplifier stage.
