# A HYDRAULIC CONTROL SYSTEM

## Abstract
A hydraulic control system for regulation of fluid flow rate, in which the fluid flow rate to and from a load actuator 28 is modulated by electric current in a single electromagnetic device 25 such that the flow rate is independent of load magnitude when the system is used without load velocity feedback and such that the flow rate is independent of both load magnitude and fluid viscosity when the system is used with load velocity feedback.
