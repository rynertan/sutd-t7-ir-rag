# Pattern fuel assembly loading system.

## Abstract
An interactive system 10 for facilitating assembly of fuel rods into nuclear fuel assemblies having specific grid location requirements for the fuel rods, includes an operator work station 12 adapted for positioning between a supply of fuel rods and a fuel assembly loading magazine 22 . Identifying data with each fuel rod is compared by a computer 28 with the stored data for the particular fuel assembly to be asembled and this rod is then caused to be inserted in the respective proper grid location for the fuel rod.
