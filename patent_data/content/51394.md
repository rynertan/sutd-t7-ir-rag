# Electrooptical modulator.

## Abstract
An electrooptical modulator arranged to act as a scan ning device for deflection of an optical beam of light across an image plane. The device comprises a body 12 of electrooptical crystal material and a periodic array of parallel, spaced electrodes 20 associated with one surface of the body. A light beam 16 entering the crystal body is caused to interact with electric fields established at the one surface by step applied voltages to the electrode array that influence the deflection of the light beam at the moment of total internal reflection at the one surface. By varying the magnitude of the applied voltages across the electrodes, a corresponding approximation of a desired phase retardation can be pro duced along the phase front of the light beam. The phase retardation across the light beam can be designed to produce a linear phase front 39 angled beam or can be designed to produce a curvilinear phase front forming a focused spot at the image plane.
