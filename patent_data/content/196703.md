# Amplifier arrangement.

## Abstract
A high efficiency amplifier of the class G type comprises a first transistor T₁ whose collector is connec connected to a first supply voltage V₁ via a first diode D₁ , and a second transistor T₂ which is connected in series with said first transistor and which has its collector connected to a second supply voltage V₂ . The first transistor T₁ is driven via a third transistor T₃ , which is connected as an emitter follower by means of a first current source 5 , to which third transistor the input voltage V Above a specific input voltage V
