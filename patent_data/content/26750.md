# Cutling insert of a ceramic alloy.

## Abstract
Ceramic materials intended for cutting and consisting of aluminium oxide with additives of hard carbides or nitrides, above all titanium carbide, have up to now, because of their sintering inertia, in general been pressure sintered to obtain satisfactory properties. According to the invention a ceramic alloy of excellent technological properties now exists and consists principally of Al₂O₃ and hard nitrides or carbonitrides, such as first hand TiN or Ti C, N . This has been performed by providing the alloy with a certain fraction of an Al O N compound, such as nitrogen stabilized aluminium oxide with cubic or nearly cubic structure.
