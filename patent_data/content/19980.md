# Method for the preparation of a sulphided fluorine containing nickel tungsten catalyst and process for the conversion of hydrocarbons using such a catalyst.

## Abstract
A process for the preparation of a sulphided, fluorine containing nickel tungsten catalyst, in which a solution containing a tungsten compound and an aluminium compound is evaporated to dryness and the resultant product is calcined, impregnated with a nickel compound, sulphided and fluorinated. The catalyst can be used for conversion of hydrocarbons in the presence of hydrogen, in particular for the preparation of high viscosity lubricating oils from deasphalted residual oils, waxy distillates and or waxes.
