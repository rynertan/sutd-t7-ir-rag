# MUD BY PASS REGULATOR APPARATUS FOR MEASUREMENT WHILE DRILLING SYSTEM

## Abstract
A mud by pass regulator apparatus for regulating the flow of drilling fluid through the turbine of a downhole power generator supply in a measurement while drilling system includes a valve 94 , valve actuator 50 , and a valve actuator control 60, 64, 72 . Pressure differential across the turbine is sensed by a piston 60 located between high pressure 72 and low pressure 64 chambers increase in pressure differential moves valve actuator 50 against the bias of a spring 58 to move valve 94 away from turbine 88 and allow more fluid to by pass the turbine. This ensures regulation of the drilling fluid flowing through the power supply so that its operation is maintained within required limits of the downhole portion of the measurement while drilling apparatus.
