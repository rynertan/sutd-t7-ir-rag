# Transformer protective relay.

## Abstract
A transformer protective relay issues a relay tripping command when the differential current that is the difference between currents in the primary and secondary windings of the transformer has a magnitude larger than the specified value and, at the same time, when the differential current includes the fifth harmonic component less than the speci fied value. Another cause of tripping signal generation is the differential current value processed to have a certain timer characteristics.
