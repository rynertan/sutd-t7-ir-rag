# A method of and measuring instrument for measuring the overall phase and amplitude distortion of a transmission channel.

## Abstract
The measuring instrument of the overall phase and ampli tude distorsion at the far ends of a transmission channel is composed of a pulse generator GI, placed at one end, and of a circuit SM, placed at the other end, which regenerates the pulses and compares them with the received ones, displaying the vector difference of their spectral components on a spec trum analyzer AS.
