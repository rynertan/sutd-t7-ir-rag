# Apparatus for reproducing signals from a magnetic tape.

## Abstract
In a helical scan video tape recorder, when the color framing of a reproduced video signal when a magnetic tape is stopped and of a reference video signal when an activation command signal is sent to control means for controlling a capstan motor do not coincide, the activation state of a magnetic tape of the video tape recorder VTR is so controlled that the color framings of both video signals are quickly matched with each other. Thus, the recorder comprises a a rotary magnetic head for scanning the magnetic tape on which tracks, each storing one field of at least video information, are arranged obliquely at equal intervals along the tape to reproduce video signals b a servo circuit for controlling a capstan motor on the basis of a control signal produced for every two fields on the magnetic tape and a reference video signal supplied externally c first means for storing color framing information for the reproduced video signals at a time when the tape is stopped d second means for detecting the number of frames by which the reproduced video signals are to be delayed in order to bring the color framing thereof into phase with the color framing of the reference video signal e third means for comparing color framing information for the reproduced video signals stored in said first means and the reference video signals in response to an activation command signal and f fourth means for activating the capstan motor via the servo circuit in response to the activation command signal and for deactivating the capstan motor via the servo circuit on the basis of the output of the second means, the fourth means being controlled on the basis of the results of the comparison by the third means.
