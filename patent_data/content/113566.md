The present inventor has successfully synthesized a new compound of the formula I EMI1.1 wherein R1 is a hylroeen atom, a hydroxyl group or an alkoxyl group of 1 4 carbon atoms and R2 is an alkyl group of 1 4 carbon atoms, started from a 3 bromo or 3 chloro 5 substituted or unsubstituted naphthoquinone of the formulaEMI1.2 wherein X is a bromine or chlorine atom and R1 is as defined above and a furan diene of the formula III EMI2.1 wherein R2 is as defined above. According to a first aspect of this invention, therefore, there is provided z new intermediate compound of the general formula I EMI2.2 where n R1 denotes a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group of an alkoxyl group of 1 4 carbon atoms, particularly methoxy group and R2 denotes an alkyl group of 1 4 carbor atos, According to a sector aspect of ths invention, there is provided 2 process or the e production of a com pound of the formula I EMI3.1 wherein R1 denotes 2 hydrogen atom, hydroxyl group or an alkoxyl group of 1 4 carbon atom and R2 denotes an alkyl group of 1 4 carbon atoms, which comprises the steps of a subjecting a compound of the formula II EMI3.2 wherein R1 is as defined above and X is a bromo or chloro group and a diene compound of the formula III EMI3.3 wherein R2 is as defined above to regiospecific Diels Alder condensation to produce the adduct of the formula V EMI4.1 wherein R1 and R2 are as defined above, b oxidizing the adduct of the formula IV to produce the compound of the formula V EMI4.2 wherein R1 and R2 are as defined above, c subjecting the compound of the formula V to ozonolysis to produce an aldehyde compound of the formula VI EMI4.3 erin R1 and R2 are as defined above, d acetalyzing the aldehyde compound of the formula VI with D 2,3 butanediol to produce a compound of the formula VII EMI5.1 wherein R1 and R2 are as defined above, e subjecting the compound of the formula VII and 1 trimethylsilyl 2 butanone to asymmetric crossed aldol condensation to produce a compound of the formula VIII EMI5.2 wherein R1 nd R2 are as defined above, and f cyclizing the compound of the formula VIII to produce the desired compound of the formula I . In the process of this invention, Diels Alder reaction of the naphthoquinone or juglone of the formula II and the furan diene of the formula III occurs regioscecifically to give the desired adduct of the formula IV . Furthermore, crossed aldol condensation of the acetal compound of the formula VII and the silyl ketone, for example, l trimethylsilyl 2 butanone, gives higher asymmetric induction. These new methods discovered by the present inventor establish the asymmetric synthesis of anthracyclinones. The steps of the process of this invention are depicted by the following reaction scheme EMI7.1 In the above reaction scheme, R1 denotes a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group or an alkoxyl group such as methoxy group and R2 denotes an alkyl group of 1 4 carbon atoms. The process of this invention is now described in detail in respect of the steps of the process. In the first step, the Diels Alder condensation o the dienophile compound II with the diene compound III is carried out preferably under heating at a refluxing temperature of an inert organic solvent such as aromatic hydrocarbons, for example, benzene, toluene, xylene. In order to prevent degradation of the adduct product IV , it is preferred to use 4,4 thiobis 6 t butyl 3 methylphenol as a radical scavenger and also strontium carbonate 3rCO3 to neutralize the hydrogen halide that is formed during the reaction. After the Diels Alder reaction, the adduct of the formula V can be used for next step without purifi cation.Thus, in the second step, the crude adduct product in chloroform solution may be air oxidized in the presence of a base such as an alkylamine, preferably di isopropylamine to afford the compound of t formula V . While, if the Diels Alder condensation o the compound II with the compound III is carried out under acidic conditions followed by air oxidation, a compound of the formula V given below, tbt is, a regioisomer of the compound V , Is formed selectively. EMI9.1 In the second, oxidation step, the air oxidation of the compound IV may conveniently be effected by stirring a solution of the compound IV in dry chloroform under air atmosphere at ambient temperature or a slightly elevated temperature. Subsequently, in the third step, the compound V is ozonolyzed to produce the aldehyde compound VI . Low temperature, particularly a temperature in the vicinity of 78 C is preferred in this ozonolysis reaction. A halo genated hydrocarbon such as dichloromethane, chloroform and carton tetrachlorine can be used suitably as the solvent. Then, in the fourth step, the aldehyde compound V is reacted with D 2,3 butanediol in the presence of an acid catalyst such as pyridinium p toluenesulfonate or camphor sulfonic acid. The reaction of this acetalization step may conveniently be effected in dry benzene at the reflux temperature of the solvent under argon atomsphere. In the further step, the acetal compound VII is reacted with l trimethylsilyl 2 butanone at 2 1 low temperature, preferably at 23 to lO C, to give the compound VIII of the formula VIII as a main product, together with its stereo isomer of the formula VIII EMI10.1 wherein R1 and R2 are as defined hereinbefore. This asymmetric crossed aldol condensation may be carried out in an anhydrous organic solvent, preferably dry acetonitrile or dry tetrahydrofuran and in the presence of an acid catalyst such as a Lewis acid, especially titanium tetrachloride or tin tetrachloride. In the final1 cyclization step of the present process, the compound VIII is ring closed by treating with 2 base such as an alkali metal carbonate, preferably potassium carbonate in an organic solvent suck as e ethanol t an ambient temperature to afford the desired compound I of this invention, together with its stereo isomer on the formula I EMI11.1 Recovery of the compound I from the reaction mixture containining both the compounds I and I may be made by acidifying the reaction mixture with 1 N hydrochloric acid, admixing the acidified react on mixture with dichloromethane and water, washing the aqueous layer with dichloromethane, washing the combined organic extracts ith water and drying over anhydrous sodium sulfate, followed by removing the solvent from the organic extracts under reduced pressure to give a crude product comprising both the compounds I and I . This crude product may be purified by preparative thin layer chromatography on silica gel developed with 12 ethyl acetate in dichloromethane to obtain the compound I and the compound i separately. The compound I of This invention can be converted into aklavinone of the formula IX EMI12.1 wherein R1 and R2 are as defined above, for example, by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid at 78 to 10 C under argon atmosphere.
