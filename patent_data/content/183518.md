# PROGRAMMED MATRIX DEVICE

## Abstract
A matrix device has a permanently stored code or bit pattern comprising an electrically insulating substrate 2 having a major face carrying successively layered electrically conductive film tracks 1, 7 in non parallel directions that traverse one another at a multiplicity of locations and are separated by a film of dielectric material 3 selected locations have pathways between the tracks of successive layers to define the code or bit pattern. At these locations the pathways are defined by programmed laser formed aper tures 5 in the dielectric material 3 that access one or more film tracks 1 of a layer nearer the substrate 2 . Film track material 7 of a layer further from the substrate 2 passes through the apertures 5 to make electrical contact with the accessed film tracks 1 . The electrically conductive film tracks 1, 7 and the film 3 jof dielectric material are preferably thick film materials and are produced by screen printing. The conductive film tracks 1, 7 may comprise an electrically conductive material fired onto the said substrate, and the film 3 of dielectric material may comprise a glass or a glass ceramic, also fired onto the said substrate which is a ceramic material. A method of producing the device is also claimed.
