# Time division switching system.

## Abstract
A multimode time division switching system is disclosed in which intermodule calls are served by transmitting call information words over a bus system 114 interconnecting all modules 105 . Eeach trans mitted word contains information specifying the receiv ing module identification number, the time slot in which the call is to be served in the receving module, as well as the message or intelligence representing the subject matter of the call. A FIFO memory 204 in each module 105 is used as an input buffer to temporarily store each received word and thereby reduce the need for short term time slot synchronization between modules.
