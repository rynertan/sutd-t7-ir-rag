## Description
The present invention relates to a DNA sequence. In particular it relates to an upstream activator sequence of the yeast phosphoglycerate kinase The recent advances in recombinant DNA technology have been such that there are now many examples of the expression of heterologous gene products by host organisms. The commercial viability of such products is limited by the level of gene expression and there has been much research effort directed towards increasing expression levels. In our copending European patent application EP A2 0073635 we described a number of plasmid vectors suitable for the expression of genetic material in yeasts. A particular vector described uses the promoter of the yeast The analysis of the 5 region of other yeast genes e.g. Prior to the present invention it was not known whether efficiently expressed genes such as According to the present invention we provide an upstream activator sequence derived from the yeast Further according to the present invention we provide a yeast expression vector including the upstream activator sequence of the yeast Further according to the present invention we provide a method for increasing the expression level of a yeast expression vector comprising inserting the upstream activator sequence of the yeast The heterologous promoter sequence may be any promoter sequence known to the art other than the The invention is now illustrated by the following Example, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Use of the restriction enzymes, Bal 31 and general techniques were as described in European patent application EP A2 0073635. β galactosidase activity was assessed on XG plates Rose et The starting molecule for the analysis of the 5 region of the yeast PGK gene was pMA213 Figure 1 . Plasmid pMA213 is a member of the pMA22a deletion series described in European patent application EP A2 0073635. The deletion endpoint of pMA 213 is such that when a 3.1 Kb Bam HI fragment containing the In order to generate a set of deletions which lacked various maounts of the 5 region of the In order to assay the expression capabilities of these deleted 5 regions we transformed yeast strain MD40 4C European patent application EP A2 0073635 with plasmids pMA335, 336, 337, 339, 340 and 97a Figure 5 and then plated these transformants onto XG plates. Figure 5 gives a subjective estimate of the intensity of blue colour in the colonies and therefore of galactosidase activity. These estimates were confirmed by precise quantitation of β galactosidase activity in extracts of the transformants Table 1 . These data clearly demonstrate the presence of an upstream activator sequence between positions 324 and 456 in the 5 region of the yeast It will of course be understood that the present invention has been described above purely by way of example, and modifications of detail can be made within the scope and spirit of the invention.
