This is in turn condensed in step b with a malonic ester R stands for an alkyl group of e.g. 1 to 6 carbon atans in the malonic ester formula to give the 5 tsubstituted phenyl cyclohexane 1,3 dione derivative of formula VI . This is then subjected to alkaline hydrolysis followed by acidification and decarboxylation to give the cyclohexane 1,3 dione VII .This is then reacted in step d with an acid anhydride R3Co 20 in presence of a salt of the acid R3C02M, to give the 2 acyl 5 substituted phenyl cyclohexane dione of formula VIII . This is then reacted in step e with an 0 substituted hydroxylamine to give the compound II .Compounds of formula I in which R1 is an optionally substituted aliphatic radical or an acyl radical may be prepared from compounds of formula II by reaction with the appropriate aliphatic halide or acyl halide as required. The other compound used in the process of the invention, isoproturon, is a commercially available herbicide often referred to as IPU and having the following structural formula EMI6.1 The composition comprising a compound of formula I and isoproturon is applied preferably in early spring to the crop area of winter wheat and winter barley. The proportions of compound I and isoproturon may vary, depending upon factors such as the identity of the particular weeds to be controlled. However, by way of example, a suitable rate of application may comprise from 500 to 2000 grams of isoproturon per hectare with from 50 to 500 grams per hectare of a compound of Formula I 1. A further example comprises a rate of application of from 1000 to 1500 grams per hectare of isoproturon in conjunction with 50 to 150 grams per hectare of a compound of formula I . Depending upon the identity of the weeds likely to be present it may be desirable to add a further herbicide to the combination of compound of formula I and isoproturon.Thus where broad leaved weeds may be prevalent it may be preferred to add a herbicide capable of controlling such weeds eg mecoprop, bromoxynil or ioxynil at the usual rates employed for such herbicides. In general, the compounds used in the process of the invention are applied in admixture with a carrier or diluent. The carrier may be solid or liquid, and may comprise one or more adjuvants of various kinds, for example a surface active agent. In another aspect, therefore, the invention provides a herbicidal composition comprising a compound of formula I in admixture with isoproturon. Preferably the composition further contains a carrier comprising a solid or liquid diluent. The composition preferably also contains a surface active agent The solid compositions of the invention may be for example, in the form of dusting powders1 or may take the form of granules. Suitable solid diluents include, for example, kaolin, bentonite, kieselguhr, dolomite, calcium carbonate, talc, powdered magnesia, and Fuller s earth. Solid compositions may also be in the form of dispersible powders or grains comprising in addition to the active ingredient, a wetting agent to facilitate the dispersion of the powder or grains in liquids. Such powders or grains may include fillers, suspending agents and the like. Liquid compositions include aqueous solutions, dispersions and emulsions containing the active ingredient preferably in the presence of one or more surface active agents. Water or organic liquids may be used to prepare solutions, dispersions, or emulsions of the active ingredient. The liquid compositions of the invention may also contain one or more corrosion inhibitors for example lauryl isoquinolinium bromide. Surface active agents may be of the cationic, anionic or non ionic type. Suitable agents of the cationic type include for example quaternary ammonium compounds, for example cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide. Suitable agents of the anionic type include for example soaps, salts of aliphatic mono esters of sulphuric acid, for example sodium lauryl sulphate and salts of sulphonated aromatic compounds, for example dodecyl benzenesulphonate, sodium, calcium and ammonium ligno sulphonate, butylnaphthalene sulphonate, and a mixture of the sodium salts of diisopropyl and triisopropyl naphthalenesulphonic acid.Suitable agents of the non ionic type include, for exampl, the condensation products of ethylene oxide with fatty alcohols such as oleyl alcohol and cetyl alcohol, or with alkyl phenols such as octylphenol, nonylphenol, and octylcresol. Other non ionic agents are the partial esters derived from long chain fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example sorbitol monolaurate the condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide and the lecithins. The compositions which are to be used in the form of aqueous solutions, dispersions or emulsions are generally supplied in the form of concentrate containing a high proportion of the active ingredient, the concentrate being diluted with water before use. These concentrates are usually required to withstand storage for prolonged periods and after such storage to be capable of dilution with water in order to form aqueous preparations which remain homogeneous for a sufficient time to enable them to be applied by conventional spray equipment. One form of concentrate comprises a suspension of the finely divided active ingredients in water containing a surfactant to assist in maintaining the suspension in a dispersed state, and to assist in the dispersion of the concentrate in water when diluted to the spray composition.Presumably the surfactant or surfactants comprise a non ionic or anionic surface active agent. Particular examples of such surface active agents include the mixed condensation product of monylphenol with 31 molar proportions of ethylene oxide and a terminal block of 13 molar proportions of propylene oxide sold under the TradeMark NPE 1800 and the block co polymers of polyethylene oxide and polypropylene oxide sold under the Pluroinic Trade Mark. The compositions used in the invention may contain, in addition to carriers and surface active agents, various other constituents to increase their usefulness. They may contain, for example, buffering salts to maintain the pH of the composition within a desired range antifreeze agents, for example urea or propylene glycol adjuvants, for example, oils and humectants and sequestrants, for example citric acid and ethylenediaminetetracetic acid, which help to prevent the formation of insoluble precipitates when the compositions are diluted with hard water. Aqueous dispersions may contain anti settling agents and anticaking agents. The compositions may in general contain a dye or pigment to impart a characteristic colour. Agents for increasing viscosity may be added to reduce the formation of fine droplets during spraying, and thereby reduce spray drift. Other additives useful for particular purposes will be known to those skilled in the formulation art. In general concentrates may conveniently contain from 10 to 85 and preferably from 25 to 60 by weight of active ingredient. Dilute preparations ready for use may contain varying amounts of the active ingredient, depending upon the purpose for which they are to be used however, dilute preparations suitable for many uses contain between 0.01 and 10 and preferably between 0.1 and 1 by weight of the active ingredient.
