# Glutathione peroxidase, process for production thereof, method and composition for the quantitative determination of lipid peroxide.

## Abstract
Glutathione peroxidase is produced by fermentation of a microorganism of the genus Mucor The peroxidase is seleni um free and may be used for the determination of lipid peroxi de by oxidation of a reduced glutathione in the presence of the glutathione peroxidase, blocking the unreacted reduced glu tathione and determining the oxidised glutathione. Also dis closed is a reagent for the determination of lipid peroxide com prising the glutathione peroxidase, reduced glutathione, an SH blocking agent, alkali and a fluorescent agent.
