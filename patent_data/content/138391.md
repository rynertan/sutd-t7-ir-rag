# Construction of novel mutant micro organisms.

## Abstract
This invention provides novel mutant strains of microor ganisms e.g., Pseudomonas putida Biotype A which are capable of converting substrates such as toluene, p xylene, catechol and 4 methylcatechol to 2 hydroxymuconic semi aldehyde or substituted analogue of 2 hydroxymuconic semialdehyde quantitatively by the meta catechol 2,3 oxy genase pathway. No active 2 hydroxymuconic semialdehyde metabolis ing enzymes are induced in the micro organism, thereby permitting a 2 hydroxymuconic semialdehyde type metabo lite to be produced and accumulated in a bioconversion me dium containing the micro organism.
