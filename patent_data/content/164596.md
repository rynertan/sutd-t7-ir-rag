# Process for the preparation of a catalyst and olefin polymerization.

## Abstract
A polymerization catalyst providing a good balance of productivity and polymer fines prepared by reacting a metal halide, such as MgCl₂, with a titanium compound, such as Ti OEt ₄, to form a first catalyst component mixing a solution of said first catalyst component with an organoaluminum compound at a temperature in the range of 100 to 70 C then heating to a higher temperature in the range of 50 C to 110 C to form additional precipitate, and then reacting the resulting solid with a halogenating agent.
