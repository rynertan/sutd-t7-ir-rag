# Method and apparatus of program patching in a data processing system.

## Abstract
A single chip microcomputer device contains on chip program storage in a read only memory 17 , and this program may be corrected or uptaded by patching. The ROM addresses are applied to an off chip memory device 44 containing one bit for each potential ROM address, and each bit is set to mark the beginning address of code to be patched an interrupt is signalled when one of these set bits is accessed by an address occurring during operation of the microcomputer. The interrupt causes the processor to branch to an off chip program memory 40 to insert the patch code. The patch ends in a branch back to the on chip ROM.
