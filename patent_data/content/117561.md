# Fibrous structure having roughened surface and process for producing same.

## Abstract
A fibrous structure having a roughened surface and a process for producing the same are disclosed. Upon dying, the fibrous structure is greatly improved in color depth. In addition, it gives on a creak feeling more than silk does, and it provides new functions. The fibrous structure has surface irregularities whose structure is such that the distance between the adjacent pro jections is 0.01 to 0.7 micrometer and the area of concave parts accounts for 0.1 to 0.8 square micrometer in 1 square micrometer of the irregularities. The fibrous structure is produced by the steps of attach ing fine particles to the fiber surface in an amount of 0.001 to 10 wt based on the fiber, said fine particles having an average primary particle diameter smaller than 0.5 micro meter and being more inert than the fiber constituting po lymer base material in low temperature plasma, and treat ing the fiber, to which said fine particles have been at tached, with low temperature plasma, whereby forming projections which are larger than the average primary parti cle diameter.
