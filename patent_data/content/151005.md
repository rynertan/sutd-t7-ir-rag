# LIQUID SAMPLE SPOTTING APPARATUS

## Abstract
A liquid sample spotting apparatus having a base, a holder which is mounted on the base by an elastic body such as a spring in such a manner that said holder is movable downward against an action of the elastic body for recover ing the original form, and a manually operable micropipette which is detachably supported by the holder. A process for spotting a liquid sample on an analytical element using said apparatus, which comprises steps of moving downward the holder and the micropipette with a droplet of the liquid sam ple formed on the pointed end against the recovering action of the elastic body stopping the downward movement of the micropipette when the droplet of the liquid sample bridges the micropipette and the surface of the analytical element to spot the droplet on the element and elevating the micro pipette to the original position by the recoverable action of the elastic body.
