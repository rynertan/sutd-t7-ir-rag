# Method and apparatus for marking a plurality of film frames each containing an image of the same subject.

## Abstract
An apparatus and method for processing a plurality of film frame images of the same subject, particularly in the production of a parallax stereogram, i.e., free vision stereogram. The images on a film strip 83 or other plurality of frames are optically viewed to establish homologous points for each film frame image. In one embodiment two images are optically superimposed to establish a stereo base distance. Each film frame 91 is then marked in accordance with the homologous points or with the stereo base distance. The marking 90 may be mechanical or may be optically generated. Each film frame 91 is thereafter aligned or sensed while in an enlarger 13 , the marks 90 establishing the accurate registration of each frame. Each film frame 91 is exposed onto a photo sensitive material 95 using a movable line grid 97 . A lenticular screen 96 is superimposed over the developed picture to form the stereoscopic photograph.
