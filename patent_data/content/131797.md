# Method of making composite material of matrix metal and fine metallic particles dispersed therein.

## Abstract
A composite material having a first metallic material as the matrix material and extremely fine particles of diameters of the order of tens to hundreds of angstroms of a second metal dispersed in this metallic matrix material is obtained by rapidly adiabatically cooling vapor of the second metallic material through a nozzle, and squirting a jet of fine particles 15 produced thereby into a molten mass 13 of the first material. Optionally, inert gas may be squirted through the nozzle along with the vapor of the second metallic material.
