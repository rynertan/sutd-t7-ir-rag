# Method for producing textured yarn.

## Abstract
A method for producing a textured polyester yarn, especially in an in draw texturing system, in which starting yarn is processed by means of a non touch type heater under a heater temperature in a range of from 350 C to 800 C and a shorter processing time in a range of from 0.04 second to 0.12 second. The dyeing evenness of the fabric made from the resultant yarn is improved because the dyeability of the yarn is almost constant despite fluctuation of the heater temperature. A belt type twister is preferably utilized for false twisting a yarn rather than a disc type.
