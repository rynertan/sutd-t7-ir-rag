## Description
This invention relates to a method and an apparatusto protectively install a transmission cable in aduct, and more particularly, to provide a bundle ofinner ducts which embody a construction tofacilitate installation in a pre existing duct for protectivelyreceiving a transmission cable. It is common practice to replace sheathed cables,particularly telephone communication cables inexisting ducts. Reuse of these ducts greatly reducesthe cable placement operations, particularlywhere the existing cables traverse obstacles, whetherman made or natural, along a buried, submarineand or aerial route. The use of existing ducts isalso desirable where the route of the ducts isbeneath city streets, residential or business property. To avoid the costs and time to expose a ductand cable along a route, an existing cable can bepulled by a winch line from the duct. The replacementcable may embody improved technology,particularly the use of optical fibers for transmissionof communication signals, hereinafter referredto as light guide cable. When cable having metalconductors is replaced with light guide cables, considerablyless space in the duct is occupied by thereplacement cables because the dlameter thereof ismuch less as compared with the diameter of thecable having metal conductors. Light guide cables can be placed in the sheathingof an existing cable after the conductors areremoved from the sheathing while the existing cableremains in situ. A method for removing theconductors from the cable in this manner is disclosedin U.S. A 4,197,628 and providesfor forcing lubricant through a sleeve which isattached to one end of the sheathing and allowingthe lubricant to flow along the conductors in thecable. After the lubricant disperses in the sheathing,the conductors are withdrawn by applying aforce to one end of the conductor. Light guidecable may then be reintroduced into the sheathing. The placement operation of light guide cable intoan existing duct which may include placing thecable in the sheathing from an existing cable, requiresspecial procedures to avoid damage to thelight guide cable. In U.S. A 4,458,880 and4,508,317, there is disclosed a method and apparatusto measure tension imposed on a cable by apull line in a conduit which includes a tensionmeter coupled between the cable and the pull line.The tension meter includes a load cell connectedto electronic circuitry for delivering a tension signalwhich is detected and used to control tension imposedon the cable. The use of the tension meterenables accurate control of the tension on the pullline, particularly when the pull line contacts theconduit or duct walls at bends which restrain thepull line and then after the cable is drawn beyondthe bend, friction of the cable against the duct wallsacts to resist movement of the cable. The strandsof optical fiber in the light guide cable are particularlysusceptible to fatigue fractures due to anexcursion of tension stress beyond a predeterminedlevel, for example, about 2200 N. Should thetension stresses exceed the predetermined level oreven the yield point of the optical fiber material, thefibers may fracture, thus losing integrity and, therefore,usefulness. A method in which an inner duct and cable isinstalled in an outer duct is known from US A 4048 807 further EP A 0 076 207 discloses a cover for housingconductors and which has external longitudinalribs to aid its installation along a conduit. For installing optical transmission cables in a selected length of anouter duct it is known US A 4 411 409 to select a bundle of innerducts which can fit inside the outer duct and to install the bundleof inner ducts inside the outer duct for extending along the lengththereof, wherein a pull line is installed at the leading end portionof each inner duct for pulling it into the outer duct. The innerducts are hollow tubes which are not provided with any additionalinstallation means for particularly protecting the opticaltransmission cables from damage during installation and for aidingthe installation of the optical transmission cables in the outerduct. Furthermore, for installing an electrical cable a conduit is known GB A 523 820 which comprises within the conduit internalcorrugations for supporting the cable in order to allow venting anddrainage of the conduit after installation of the cable. The conduitis a rigid outer duct which allows installation of the cable withoutthe risk of deformation of the outer duct. The object of the present invention as defined in claims 1 and 8 is to protect opticaltransmission cables and inner ducts from damage during installation and to aid theinstallation thereof in an outer duct by reducing friction and avoiding twisting Improvements of this method and this apparatus, respectively, aresubject matter of the corresponding dependent claims. These features and advantages of the presentinvention as well as others will be more fully understoodwhen the following description is read in lightof the accompanying drawings, in which In Fig. 1, there is illustrated a typical arrangementof an underground duct 10 extending betweenunderground work areas 11 and 12. As isconventional, the duct 10 provides a duct openingto protectively house a transmission cable. Theduct may comprise part of an array of ducts, eachhaving an opening to protectively house a transmissioncable. Any existing transmission cable inthe duct is removed in a manner, per se, wellknown in the art. Typically, for example, a winchline is connected to an end of an existing cable inone of the work areas 11 and 12 after whichtension is applied to the winch line to withdraw thecable form the duct. If desired or necessary, theconductors may be removed from the casing of theexisting cable according to the method disclosed inU.S. A 4,197,628. A manhole opening13 provides access to work area 11. Other undergroundducts generally indicated by reference numeral14 extend underground and communicatewith work area 11. Similarly, a manhole opening 15provides access to work area 12 wherein otherducts 16 are accessible. A cable 17 may have aterminal end portion extending from one of theducts 16 into the work area 12 for connection to anewly installed cable in duct 10. A cable may extendfrom some distally spaced work area throughduct 14 to work area 11 and then to supply reelcontaining a sufficient quantity of cable, which canbe unwound from the reel and fed into duct 10 soas to form an unbroken, continuing run of cableextending to work area 12. To carry out the method of the present invention,a cable eye 18 on the leading end of a pullline 19 is fed from work area 12 through conduit 10to work area 11. The pull line is unwound from astorage spool 20 which is rotatably supported by astand 21 at ground level. The storage spool maybe coupled to a motor drive 22 which is, in turn,connected to a control 23. Control 23 is of anysuitable type for controlling the direction of rotationof the reel by the drive motor and can be used tocontrol the tension developed on the pull line byrotation of the reel. A sufficient length of the pullline is unwound from the reel such that cable eye18 can be passed through an adapter nozzle 24and thence through a feeder tube 25. Tube 25 ispreferably constructed in a manner disclosed in myU.S. A 4,296,157. The cable eye is then drawnthrough a lubricating collar 26 which preferablyembodies a construction disclosed in U.S. A 4,028,473or 4,326,605 and coupled to a suitablesupply of lubricant. As will be described in greaterdetail hereinafter, an inner duct apparatus is comprisedof plastic material whereby the particularlyeffective lubricant to be applied to the outer surfaceof the inner duct during placement operation is awater based polymer which will wet the plastic surfaceof the inner duct. This type of lubricant willadhere to the surface of the inner duct to insure thepresence of effective quantities of lubricant duringthe placement operation. It is preferable to employthe lubricant embodying the composition disclosedin my U.S. A 4,111,820. This lubricant consistsof polypropylene glycol, polyethylene oxide andwater. The lubricant composition is non degradingto plastic material and, therefore, especially usefulfor lubricating the surface of the inner duct apparatusof the present invention as well as a plasticsheathed cable which will be placed in the innerduct. As shown in Fig. 1, separate strands of innerduct 30 are supplied from three separate supplyreels 31, 32 and 33, each supported by a stand 34that is, in turn, arranged on a suitable support 34Asuch as the ground surface or preferably, the rearportion of a truck bed. As shown in Fig. 3, the inner duct 30 has theform of an open ended, elongated hollow tube withan endless side wall formed by extruding plasticmaterial. The extruded configuration of the innerduct essentially includes a continuous inner surfacecomprised of spaced apart and generally parallelprotruding internal ribs 35. Sufficient ribs areformed, typically 4 per cm of internal wall surface,to retain a supply of lubricant between the ribs.The lubricant is drawn from the reservoir areasbetween the ribs to protruding edges of the ribswhich form the only area of frictional contact withthe transmission cable when installed in the innerduct. Preferably, the ribs have an inverted V shapedconfiguration in cross section, as shown inFig. 3. The protruding height of the ribs, preferablyabout 0,8 mm, is effective for the transmission ofheat during cable placement operation and for preventingspiraling or twisting of cable while advancedalong the internal ribs. The duct is producedby extruding plastic material and immediatelyafter the extrusion process, the ribs rapidlydissipate heat from the newly formed extrusion.This enhances the dimensional stability of the innerduct, particularly linearity and the tubular configuration.The ribs, therefore, serve to prevent the formationof an oval cross sectional configuration tothe inner duct which is undesirable because itimpedes movement of the cable in an inner duct.Also, the enhanced cooling by the ribs preventstwisting of the inner duct along a selected lengththereof when coiling and uncoiling. The plastic material of the inner duct 30 is preferably comprisedof polyethylene. The side walls of the inner ducttube also have a continuous external surface comprisedof spaced apart and generally parallel protrudingexternal ribs 36 extending lengthwise of thetube in a generally parallel and spaced apart relationwhich is sufficient to contain a supply of lubricantbetween the ribs and form the only area offrictional contact with a duct while advancedtherealong. The number of ribs 36 is generally1,6 to 2 per cm of external wall surface. Theexternal ribs differ as to their location relative to theinternal ribs 35 such that generally a rib 35 and arib 36 do not extend along a single radius. Thenon aligned arrangement of ribs maintains dimensionalstability of the inner duct. The ribs 36 alsoprovide sites for dissipation of heat that may begenerated during placement operation of the innerduct as well as dissipation of heat from ambientsources after the inner duct has been placed. Suchambient heat sources are usually discovered alonga cable route in areas of the country having a warmclimate. A bundle of innerducts in side by side relationship is drawn into a duct. Generally,as many inner ducts as possible are placedin a duct to fill and maintain the integrity of theduct even though, for example, only one light guidecable may be placed in one of the plurality of innerducts. In this way, when there is a need to expandthe transmission capacity along the route of atransmission cable, additional lightguide cablescan be placed in the unused openings of the innerducts at some future time. It is intended by thedesign of the inner duct to place three inner ducts30 in an existing duct such as shown in Fig. 2 ofthe drawings. The three inner ducts extend in agenerally parallel relationship which is effectivelymaintained by an interlocking engagement betweenribs 36. The ribs effectively maintain the triangulararrangement of inner ducts and prevent spiraling ofthe bundle of inner ducts while advanced along theduct during the placement operation. Spiraling, i.e.,twisting of the ducts, one about the other, duringadvancement along a duct is particularly undesirablesince the light guide cable must follow thetortuous path of an inner duct. Preferably, a pullline 37 is installed in the inner duct before placementin a duct. After placement of the inner duct, acable end is attached by a gripper, per se, knownin the art, and the cable is pulled in the inner ductby the pull line. The pull line is preferably made upof warp and weft threads consisting of aromaticpolyamide fibers as disclosed in U.S. A 4 508317. The pull line is installed by attaching a plug toone end of the line and using compressed air oranother suitable air supply to force the plug andline along a selected length of inner duct or, ifdesired, along the entire supply of inner duct oneach of the supply reels 31, 32, and 33. The pullline can be severed when the selected length ofinner duct is taken from a reel and severed fromthe remaining supply of inner duct. In the event acable is pulled into one or more, but less than all ofthe inner ducts in a duct, the pull line in the unusedinner duct can be permitted to remain therein untilat some future time is desired to place a cable. Atthat time, the pull line can be used to install acable in the remaining inner duct. To carry out the installation process ofa bundle of inner ducts, the cable eye 18 isattached by a chain link as shown in Fig. 5, tofitting 41, there being provided a fitting 41 for eachinner duct. Threechains 42 are connected at one end of each chainto a coupling ring 43 which is, in turn, connectedby a link 44 to the cable eye 18. The free ends ofthe chains are connected to an opening 45 in eachof the fittings 41. The fittings, as shown in Fig. 6,each comprises an end portion 46 having the opening45 therein which extends between parallel flatface surfaces. Portion 46 extends to a threadedshank portion 48 made up of coarse threads withsharp edges at the crest of the thread so that thefitting can be threadedly engaged in an inner ductby rotating the fitting. Preferably, the threads are ofself tapping design and to facilitate the threadedengagement of the fitting with an inner duct, protrudingfrom the threaded portion of the fitting is aguide section 49 to maintain a generally coaxialrelationship between the longitudinal axis of thefitting and the center of the inner duct As bestshown Fig. 5, the opposed, flat face surfaces ofportion 46 provide convenient areas for engagementwith a wrench to apply torque for establishingthreaded engagement with good integrity. After a suitable length of a bundleof inner ducts as shown in Fig. 5 is connected tothe pull line as just described, the tension reel isoperated to pull the inner ducts in the duct 10.When a bundle of inner ducts isbeing installed in the duct and after the chains 42have passed through the lubricating collar 26, thelubricant is delivered to the collar for application tothe external surface of the inner duct. To preventspiraling or twisting of one inner duct about otherinner ducts in the bundle, the strands of inner ductunwound from the reels 31, 32, and 33 are preferablycarried out by drawing a strand of inner ductfrom each of the reels 31, 32, and 33 by alternatelypulling a strand from the top of the first reel, thenpulling a strand from the bottom of the second reel and then pulling a strand from the top of the thirdreel when the reels are arranged as shown in Fig.1. Alternating the unwinding sites from the top ofone reel to the bottom of the next reel should becarried out when the external surface of the innerduct does not include ribs which, as describedpreviously, produce an interlocking between theducts and prevent spiraling. The ribs also preventlongitudinal twisting of the inner duct during installationin a duct. The pull cable is then advancedto draw three strands of the inner duct along theguide tube and through nozzles 24 into duct 10. Asshown in Fig. 4, reservoirs of lubricant are establishedby the spaces between ribs 36 and fromthese reservoirs. lubricant is continuously fed to theprotruding edge surfaces of the ribs to maintain aneffective lubricant film between the inner duct andthe duct 10. After the leading ends of the innerduct strands emerge from the duct 10 in work area12, the pull line is disconnected from the couplingring 43 and the fittings 41 are disconnected fromthe ends of the inner ducts. In work area 11, feedertube 25 is retracted along with nozzle 24 from theduct 10 to expose the strands of inner duct whichare then severed and the unwound lengths of innerduct strands in the guide tube 25 are returned tothe reels by rewinding operations. The transmission cable, which is preferablycomprised of light guide cable, is brought to theinstallation site in coiled form on a reel that issupported by a stand in the same manner as reels31 33. The leading end of the light guide cable issecured to a pull line. Preferably, there is arrangedbetween the pull line and the cable, a tensionmeter to carry out the cable placement operation inaccordance with the disclosures of U.S. A 4,458,880and 4,461,459. Tension is then appliedto the pull line to advance the leading end of thelight guide cable through the lubricating collar 26along the guide tube 25 and thence into one of theinner ducts. A detector 49, for example, is arrangedin work area 12 to detect a tension signal producedby the tension meter. The detected signal is usedfor controlling tension imposed on the light guidecable by the pull line. The presence of lubricant onthe cable greatly reduces friction and thus thepulling force required to install the cable in theinner duct. It can be seen from Fig. 4, that theprotruding ribs from the inner surface of the innerduct provide reservoir areas for lubricant which issupplied to the edges of the ribs to maintain aneffective film of lubricant on the outer surface ofthe cable 50 while advanced in the inner duct 30.The ribs which, as described previously, extendalong the length of the inner duct facilitate guidingand prevent twisting of the light guide cable whileadvanced in the inner duct. After the leading end ofthe light guide cable emerges from the inner ductat the site of work area 12, the pull line is disconnectedand the usual connecting operations arecarried out to join the light guide cable to othercable to form part of a communication system. It isto be understood, of course, that another length oflight guide cable can be placed in other inner ductswhich extend along duct 10. Such installation proceduresare carried out by pulling each light guidecable individually at dlfferent times through an innerduct.
