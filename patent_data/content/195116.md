## Description
COMPOUND HAVING ANTIBACTERIAL AND ANTIMYCOTIC ACTIVITIES,PREPARATION THEREOF AND PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING IT The present invention concerns the compound 1 2 2,4 dichlorophenyl 2 2,4 dichlorophenyl methoxySethyl l pivaloyloxymethyl lH imidazolium chloride, having formula IEMI1.1 Compound I is endowed with remarkable antibacterial and antimycotic activities, and it is therefore useful in therapy. Another object of the invention is therefore provided by pharmaceutical compositions containing it as the active principle. Compound I is prepared according to the invention by reacting l pivaloyloxymethyl imidazole, having formulaII, with l chloro 2 2,4 dichlorophenyl 2 Z 2,4 dichloro benzyl oxy ethane, of formula III, according to the following scheme I SCHEME IEMI2.1 Alternatively, compound I may be prepared by reaction of 1 2,4 dichloro ss 2,4 dichlorobenzyl oxy phene tylj imidazole, of formula IV, with pivalic acid chloromethylester, having formula V according to the following schema II SCHEME II EMI2.2 The following examples are given by way of illustrating the invention. EXAMPLE 1 1 u 2,4 Dichlorophenyl 2 2,4 dichlorophenyl methoxi7 ethyl 1 pivaloyloxymethyl 1H imidazolium chloride, from 1 pivaloyloxymethyl imidazole and 1 chloro 2 2,4 dichlo rophenyl 2 2,4 dichlorobenzyl oxy ethane An intimate mixture of l chloro 2 2,4 dichlorophe nyl 2 t 2, 4 dichlorobenzyl oxy ethane 3.84 g 10 mmoles and of l pivaloyloxymethyl imidazole 1.82 g 10 mmoles is heated in water bath under stirring to about 600C for 2 hours. After cooling, a glassy bulk, which is crystallized from a diethyl ether ethanol 1 1 mixture, is obtained. The analitically pure compound is obtained 4.1 g 7.23 mmoles yield 72.3 , having the following characteristics Aspect white, microcrystalline slightly hygroscopic pow der.Melting point 850C not correct melting starts at 770C .Solubility soluble in water, methanol and ethanol.Elemental analysis for C24H25Cl5N2O3 566.7 C H N Calc. 50.86 4.44 4.94 Found 50.81 4.47 4.96.Ionic chlorine AgNO3 calc. 6.25 found 6.30.I.R.

Compound I, which will be hereinafter called alsoRG 024, for sake of shortness, displays remarkable antimycotic and antibacterial activities, higher or comparable to that of miconazole, being effective against yeasts and molds as well as gram positive and gram negative bacteria. The microbiological tests carried out, hereinafter reported, further elucidate the activity of compound I. Kin vitro antimycotic activity The in vitro antimycotic activity of RG 024, in comparison with that of miconazole M.I.C., i.e. minimum inhibiting concentration, expressed in mcg ml was evaluated in liquid culture medium Get Nitrogen Base DIFCO with 5 of glucose against myceti from hospital isolation wards. The method is that of scalar dilutions of the test compounds on Microtiter plates, in a 1 2 dilution ratio. 4Suspensions titre 10 of fungal sporae and Candida cells, grown on Sabouraud, and Dextrose Agar, were collec ted at the moment of use in the same medium used for the test and inoculated by means of a multi inoculation Microtiter device. M.I.C. values were determined by means of visual observation of fungal growth respectively after 24 hours Candida albicans and 48 and 72 hours dermatophytes incubation at 240C. The results are shown in Table 1. TABLE 1 In vitro antimycotic activity M.I.C. expressed in mcg ml of RG 024 against rriyceti, in comparison with miconazole.

The method was that of scalar dilutions of the test products on agar plates, in a 1 2 dilution ratio. Bacte rlal suspensions grown overnight in Brain Heart Infusion DISCO, were diluted 1 100 in new culture medium and inoculated by means of a multiinoculation device. M.I.C. values were determined by visual observation of bacterial growth, after 18 hours incubation, at 370C. The results are shown in Table 2. TABLE 2 In vitro activity M.I.C. expressed in mcg ml of RG 024 on Gram and Gram microorganisms. Microorganisms RG 024 Micona zoleStaphylococcus aureus ATCC 9144 0.19 0.39 Staphylococcus aureus 35 0.39 6.25Staphylococcus aureus 38 0.19 0.39Streptococcus pyogenes A l 0.19 0.39Streptococcus pyogenes C 0.39 0.39Streptococcus faecalis OMI 1 6.25 12.5Streptococcus faecalis OMI 2 6.25 6.25Sarcina lutea ATCC 9341 0.19 0.19Escherichia coli OMI 17 6.25 12.5Escherichia coli OMI 16 6.25 25Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 1003 12.5 25Proteus vulgaris OMI 4 50 100Pseudomonas aeruginosa OMI 1 200 200 The above results clearly show that the values ofM.I.C., expressed in mcg ml, obtained from compound RG 024 are more favourable or equal to those obtained from miconazole, in all of the used microorganisms. Therefore, RG 024 proved to exert remarkable antimycotic and antibacterial activities, higher than those of miconazole. PHARMOKINETICS The pharmokinetics of RG 024 was evaluated in the rat by oral administration. The serum and urinary concentrations were determined by means of the method of agarwell diffusion in agar culture medium Sabouraud dextrose agar Difco seeded with Saccharomyces cerevisiae IS 214 test strain. The values of said concentrations showed for both compounds a quick absorption, which is remarkably higher for RG 024, in fact the values of the main peak which for both compounds is recorded about in the first how are substantially higher more than 40 in the case of RG 024. Moreover, RG 024 is still present in the 8th hour, while miconazole may not be detected in significant amounts after the 6th hour. Said trend is proved by the AUC area under curve values, which in the case of RG 024 are more than 2.5 times higher than those of miconazole. The present invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing therapeutically effective amounts of compound I as the active principle. Said compositions may be administered orally, in form of solid, semi solid or liquid compositions, such as capsules, tablets, dragees, syrups, oral gels or topically, in form of powders, lotions, ointments, creams, dermatologic milks or tinctures vaginal tablets, suppositories or ointments medicated soaps and the like. Said pharmaceutical compositions may be of course formulated with conventional excipients, flavouring age nts, vehicles, etc. The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are used for the treatment of pathological conditions caused by pure or mixed mycotic cutaneous infections, primary and secondary bacterial cutaneous infections, in the treatment and prophylaxys of candidiasis and of oropharyngeus, gastro intestinal and vulvo vaginal infections.
