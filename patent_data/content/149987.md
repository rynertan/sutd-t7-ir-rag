# POLYMERIZABLE COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING POLYAMINES AND POLY DIHYDROBENZOXAZINES

## Abstract
A polymerizable composition comprising a poly 3,4 dihydro 3 substituted 1,3 benzoxazine and a reactive polyamine, wherein the polyamine is at least difunctional and its reactive groups are primary or secondary amine and wherein the polydihydrobenzoxazine is the reaction product of about 1 equivalent of a primary amine, about 1 equivalent of a phenol and about two equivalents of formaldehyde. The compositions are useful as potting, encapsulating and laminating resins and as surface coatings.
