# Microwave heating apparatus.

## Abstract
A microwave heating apparatus comprising a high power microwave oscillator 1 which rises in a shorter time than a time for radiating a testing animal, a waveguide connected to the high power microwave oscillator, a measuring member 10 for reflection coefficient being connected to the waveguide and capable of being separated from the waveguide, an impedance matching part 4 connected to the output part of the waveguide, an applicator 8 formed by a short circuited tapered rectangular wave guide being connected to the output part of the impedance matching part, and a container for fixing a head of the animal which is inserted as a load peeping into the applicator through an insertion port provided on the wall of the applicator, whereby the measuring member for reflection coefficeint operates while the high power microwave oscilla tor is switched off. According to the apparatus, the head of the animal can be heated under the same heating condition so as to obtain repeatable data.
