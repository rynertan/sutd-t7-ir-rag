# A packing container blank and a packing container made from the blank.

## Abstract
Packing container blanks for gable top packages are cut out of a material web which, up to now, has caused an appreciable amount of waste material, since the edges of the blanks are irregular and cannot be dovetailed into one another. In accordance with the invention a packing contain er blank is provided with partly straight, parallel lateral edges 9, 10 , partly transverse edges 11, 12 which are profiled according to a regular pattern which is repeated over the width of the blank. As a result the profiled edges of the blanks too can be formed without wastage.
