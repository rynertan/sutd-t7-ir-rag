# Self starting brushless D.C. motor.

## Abstract
A motor is self starting using only one magneto sensitive element because the motor is of a two phase type and is provided with a detection device which detects towards which of the two phases the rotor is mainly directed. A presetting circuit compares the detected rotor position with the state of an energizing circuit in order to set this circuit so that the energizing circuit energizes the stator phases for said specific rotor position in such a way that starting of the motor is guaranteed, although initially with an undefined direction of rotation. By presetting the commutat ing direction of the energizing circuit the rotor subsequently locks the field which rotates in the correct direction if it has started in the incorrect direction.
