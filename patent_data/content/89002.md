# Method of and apparatus for automatically attaching top stops to a gapped slide fastener chain with sliders mounted thereon.

## Abstract
A longitudinally gapped, continuous slide fastener chain 21 with sliders 30 slidably mounted is longitudinally fed along by a feed roller 34 through an apparatus 33 including a top stop applicator mechanism 110 . When the slider 30 on a pair of coupling element rows 24,25 is sensed by a slider sensor 127 , the feed roller 34 is stopped and a chain stop lever 84 is lowered into a gap 29 adjacent to the coupling element rows 24,25 . The feed roller 34 is rotated again to feed the slide fastener chain 21 again to displace the chain stop lever 84 slightly downstream by engagement with a bottom stop 28 attached to a following length of coupling element rows 24,25 . When the slide fastener chain 21 is stopped again, the chain deflector 99 is lowered transversely into the path of the slide fastener chain 21 to depress the chain 21 so that the chain 21 located downstream of the chain deflector 99 is pulled back until the ends of the coupling element rows 24,25 where top stops 31,32 are to be applied are bought into clinching dies 46,47 . After the chain deflector 99 has been fully lowered, a main shaft 115 is rotated through one revolution for actuating a top stop cutter 112 to cut a pair of top stop blanks out of a flat wire bar 130 and lowering a curling punch 114 to clinch top stops 31,32 around the rows of coupling elements 24,25 at their ends in the clinching dies 46,47 . The foregoing cycle of top stop attaching operation is repeated for successively attaching top stops 31,32 to the slide fasteer chain 21 .
