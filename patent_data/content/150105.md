# PRODUCTION OF TRANSPORT FUELS FROM LIGHT OLEFINS

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a process for the conversion of a gaseous hydrocarbon feedstock rich in light olefins into a liquid product which is a fuel or is capable of being converted into a liquid fuel. The feedstock is brought into contact with a catalyst derived from a tectometallosili cate e.g. Theta 1 zeolite at a temperature from 100 500 C.
