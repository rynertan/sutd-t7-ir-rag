# Process for removing sulfur oxides and solid particulates from a gaseous effluent.

## Abstract
A process for removing catalyst fines and more than 99 of sulfur oxides in the regenerator effluent gas of a fluid catalytic cracking system, which comprises contacting within a venturi structure 3 a gaseous effluent 13 containing sulfur oxides with a liquid scrubbing mixture 15 passing the admixture of said gaseous effluent 13 and liquid scrubbing mixture 15 through a constricted passage of the venturi structure 3 to increase the velocity thereof separat ing the admixture into a liquid portion and a gas portion delivering the gas portion of the separation step to a packed tower 4 beneath the packed section 4a thereof contacting the gas portion with liquid scrubbing mxiture in the packed section fot he tower 4 to form a gaseous overhead effluent 20 substantialy free of sulfur oxides and a bottoms liquid combining the bottom liquid from the packed section 4a of the tower 4 with the liquid portion from the separating step to form a combined liquid bottoms adjusting the pH of the combined liquid bottoms with a basic solution 25 to form a liquid scrubbing mixture and dividing the liquid scrubbing mixture into a tower bottoms products 27 , a first recycle stream 15 providing the liquid scrubbing mixture to the venturi structure 3 , and a second recycle stream 19 providing the liquid scrubbing mixture to the packed tower 4 .
