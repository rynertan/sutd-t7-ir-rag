# Belt guidance arrangement for conveyor system.

## Abstract
An upper pair of rollers 5 and 6 and a lower pair of rollers 8 and 9 guide a continuous conveying belt 10. The rollers 6 and 9 are mounted on a static frame. The rollers 5 and 8 are swingable about a vertical axis 11 to change the direction of run 10a of the belt. Each of the rollers 5 and 8 and or each of the rollers 6 and 9 is mounted for adjustment in a direction parallel to the direction of travel of the belt at that roller as shown by the arrows to compensate for the change of stresses in the belt resulting from the swinging of the rollers 5 and 8. Sensors 12 monitoring the transverse movement of the belt control the compensating movements of the rollers. In other embodiments described the compensation is effected by changing the outer diameters of the rollers so that these vary across the width of each roller.

## Description
BELT GUIDANCE ARRANGEMENT FOR CONVEYOR SYSTEM This invention relates to a belt guidance arrangement for use in a conveyor system, such as those used in mining operations. In mining operations, for example, a mining machine is situated at the mine face and such machine may be expected to mine an arcuate surface of the face, rather than a narrow straight ahead surface, and feed its output to a first conveyor stretch directly behind it. Of course, as the mining machine traverses its arcuate path, the first conveyor stretch must follow it and, since such first conveyor stretch must feed its output to a following second stretch of conveyor which has to be maintained in a more or less constant orientation relative to the face, a problem arises as to the minimization of side slippage and wear on the belt as the first conveyor stretch is swung to different positions relative to the second stretch and is expected to continue its normal function. Indeed, problems are encountered in all situations, i.e. refuse spreading by belt conveyor arrangements, where belt conveyors have to assume a dog leg configuration, particularly configurations of continuously variable angle. belt conveying has not generally been considered practical for open pit mines which are either irregular or confined in shape or having relatively steep wall angles, even though costs in many cases could be better than conventional truck haulage. Optimal overland belt conveyor routes often encounter local natural obstacles such as mountains or bodies of water. The solution usually requires expensive excavation and or foundation works which reduces the desirability of the technology. It is the object of the present invention to solve the afore mentioned problems. According to the present invention there is provided for use in a conveyor system, such as used, for example, in a mining operation, a belt guidance arrangement comprising upper and lower pairs of belt bending rollers, one of each of the pairs of rollers being mounted on a first, static frame and the other of each of the pairs of rollers being mounted on a second frame swingable horizontally with respect to the first frame, means to vary the distance between the external roller surfaces of the rollers of each pair, longitudinally of the direction of movement of the belt to compensate for relative swinging movement of the rollers in each pair by balancing the sum of the transverse components of the tension forces in the belt on the left hand side of a belt with the sum of the transverse components of the tension forces in the belt on the right hand side of the belt. According to one preferred form of the invention, a belt guidance arrangement comprises upper and lower pairs of belt bending rollers, one of each of the pairs of rollers being mounted on a first, static frame and the other of each of the pairs of rollers being mounted on a second frame swingable horizontally with respect to the first frame, at least each the one or each the other of the pairs of rollers being mounted for adjustable movement longitudinally of the direction of movement of the belt, and means for adjustment of the movable rollers longitudinally of the belt to compensate for relative swinging movement of the rollers in each pair by balancing the sum of the transverse components of the tension forces in the belt on the left hand side of the belt with the sum of the transverse components of the tension forces in the belt on the right hand side of the belt. Problems addressed by the present invention are the avoidance of undue stress upon the belt resulting from relative swinging movement and the maintenance of belt alignment and training of the belt in passing through the rollers. According to one preferred feature of the invention there is provided a convex roller having a maximum diameter to minimum diameter ratio of about 3 1 and a roller length to maximum diameter of about 5 1. It is preferred that the means for movable roller adjustment are adapted to adjust each of each pair by an equal amount towards or away from each other. Conveniently the static frame and the second frame are constructed as a unit and are mounted for movement as a unit.

DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Referring now to Figure 1, there is shown a system including a first part 1 which is adapted to be connected to and collect output from, say, a face mining machine, a shovel and crusher combination, or other device, and deliver such output to a second part 2 for delivery eventually to the discharge end of the conveyor to, say, a stacker. The parts 1 and 2 are of suitable design and need not be described in great detail beyond saying that they may conveniently form a unit, as shown in Figure 1, mounted on crawler tracks, skids, or the like with a suitable chute means 7 spanning the belts 10a, lOb. The present invention is mainly directed to the area of connection 3, between parts 1 and 2 and the following description, therefore, will be largely limited to that area. In the area 3, as clearly shown in Figure 4, there are two pairs belt bending rollers, pulleys or drums, an upper pair 4, comprising top roller 5 and bottom roller 6, and a lower pair 7, comprising top roller 8 and bottom roller 9, the upper pair 4 guiding the productcarrying run of conveyor belt 10 and the lower pair 7 guiding the return run of the conveyor. The rollers 6 and 9 are carried by the part 2, which is referred to herein as the static part, and the rollers 5 and 8 are carried by the part 1, which is swingable laterally relative to part 2. Each of the product carrying run and return run of the belt has a first stretch 10a on part 1 and a second stretch lOb on part 2 and these, of course, move laterally relative to one another as part 1 is swung laterally relative to part 2 about pivot 11 in order to, say, follow the face mining machine. It should be noted that the location of pivot 11 in plan view is the tangency point of the roller pair 5 and 6 and pair 8 and 9 when such rollers are in their normal or non compensated positions, as with pivot point P in Figure 6. In this regard the part 1 may be dragged through its swing by the mining machine to which it may be attached, or it may be driven, so as to swing about part 2 and follow the mining machine see Figure 2 , by suitable motors not shown on part 2, driving through gearing 31 Figure 4 .This means that rollers 5 and 8 also swing laterally since they are mounted on part 1 relative to rollers 6 and 9 on static part 2, which would have deleterious stressing and training and alignment effects upon the belt in passing from one roller to another in each pair without provision of the compensation provided by the present invention. Such compensation is provided, in the illustrated embodiment, by sensors 12 detecting sidewise slippage of the belt and feeding signals to adjustment mechanism, such as that shown at 13 in Figure 2, which moves at least the top roller in each pair longitudinally of the belt to achieve a safe condition once again. Alternatively, of course, the bottom roller could be moved longitudinally, or both rollers could be moved longitudinally, ideally, by equal amounts by manually or automatically operating the adjustment mechanism for each roller of each pair 5,6 8,9 to move rollers 5,6 and 8,9 through equal distances towards and away from each other. The roller movement results in a variation in the distance between external roller surfaces of the rollers of each pair longitudinally of the direction of movement of the belt. Figures 5 and 6 illustrate the changes which occur in achieving such safe condition in which the belt is safeguarded against excessive side slippage and excessive tensioning and in which belt alignment and training are accomplished. Only the forces relating to roller 6 are shown, as those relating to roller 5 are mirror images of the same. In these Figures the rollers 5 and 6 are so located that, in plan view, the centers of their surface projections normally coincide with pivot point P about which part 1 pivots. When part 1 with roller 5 swings about point P , the fiber of the belt between rollers 5 and 6 coinciding with point P is the only one that is vertical. All other fibers of the belt are inclined at some angle to vertical and where the rollers of regular cylindrical form, the length of the fibers, and the tension therein, would increase with distance from point P .However the crowning of the rollers offsets this condition.Indeed, the degree of crowning of the rollers can be such as to concentrate the tension forces near the center of the belt and reduce them near the belt extremities. Ideally the crowning profile of the belt rollers will be selected to optimize the path length of individual longitudinal elements in the belt taking into account the variable roller diameter at each element, the vertical spacing of the bend roller pairs, the angle of bend and the equilibrium roller adjustment positions longitudinally of the direction of movement of the belt in compensating for relative swinging movement of the rollers in each bend roller pair. In a practical situation, one would impose a design constraint of, for example, depending upon the construction of the belting, not greater than 5 percent difference in path length from the longest to the shortest fibre.The resulting profile will usually be convex, but may in fact be a simple radius, parabolic, conical or the like depending upon the desired effect. The belt will stay in the centered position on the rollers if the sum of all horizontal transverse components of tension forces within the belt at each pulley remains equal to zero.EMI8.1 Sum of all horizontal tension force components Li between points P and C equals to sum of all horizontal tension force components Ri between points P and A If the forces on the left side prevail, the belt will move to the right EMI8.2 and vice versa EMI8.3 As shown in Figures 5 and 6, moving rollers 5 and 6 towards each other will increase tension on the left side and decrease tension on the right side of point P .Moving rollers apart will achieve the opposite effect.Thus, there is a point where the sum of all horizontal transverse tension force components within the belt at both rollers equals to zero. That is an equilibrium point or point of operation of the present invention. At this point alignment of the belt and the correct training of the belt through the rollers is accomplished. It has been found in tests, that a segmented pulley such as that shown in Figure 6a gives good results and provides for a swing of part 2 of about SO either side of the center line of part 1. Each segment 5a of the pulley 5, 6, 8 or 9 of Figure 6a has its own bearing 5b mounting on a common shaft Sc and by making the pulley or roller, or drum 5, 6, 8 or 9 of, say, 6 small diameter dimension c in Figure 6a and, say 18 large diameter dimension b in Figure 6a , and with a longitudinal dimension of between say 6 feet to 7 feet dimension a inFigure 6a a good vertical spacing between rollers 5 and 6 and 8 and 9 can be achieved and this has beneficial results on the angle of swing of rollers 5 and 8.It is anticipated that in low coal seams with restricted headroom the roller pairs may have to be moved vertically closer together than would be normally considered optimum a center spacing of about two roller maximum diameters and the angle of swing of part 2 may be then restricted somewhat, but an angle of 40 45 either side of center is expected in most conditions and more in ideal conditions. The segmented pulleys of Figure 6a have low friction with the flexible belts passing thereover and once the sensors 12 have caused the pulley pairs to be moved together or away from each other, to achieve equilibrium for a given condition, the controls become largely inactive. In the embodiment of the invention as described with respect to Figures 1 to 4 the distance between the external roller surfaces is varied by adjustiny the positions of the roller centers longitudinally of the direction of movement of the belt. In Figures 7 to 10 an alternative embodiment is shown. In this embodiment pairs of conical rollers 100, lOOa Figure 9 are employed in place of rollers 5,6 8,9 and in place of a mounting means capable of longitudinally moving the roller centers, means is provided for producing variable conicity of the rollers to vary the distance between external roller surfaces. Rollers 100, lOOa are as best seen in Figure 7, 8 and 10 made up of a series of elements 110 extending longitudinally of the rollers. These elements 110 are pivotally mounted on spider 102 and connected to laterally slidable sleeve 104 by linkage 103. Actuator 105 mounted to collar 106 is arranged to move sleeve 104 either to the right or to the left such as to tilt all drum surface elements 110 equally and simultaneously, thus achieving conicity of the drum surface see Figures 7 and 10 . The principle effect of coning each roller of a roller pair is to increase its circumferential dimension, say, at the left side with a corresponding decrease at the right side, generating proportionally variable tensions in the belt fibres.As in the previous embodiments the actuator 105 would control conicity only to vary the distance between external roller surfaces of the rollers of each pair toprovide balancing horizontal transverse tension components within the belt at the drum, or roller. Actuator 105 could, if desired, be arranged to respond to sensors 12 Figure 3 . A further alternative is seen in Figure 11 which is a view similar to Figure 7, and which shows the roller 5 or 6 or 8 or 9, preferably having an external contour as seen in Figures 3 and 4 arranged so that instead of being mounted with roller centers adjustable longitudinally of the direction of movement of the belt, as in Figures 1 to 4, a linkage arrangement is provided to move the roller elements 110 outwardly or inwardly to increase or decrease the roller outside diameter and in this fashion vary the distance between the external roller surfaces of the rollers of each pair. Preferably, rollers 5, 6, 8 and 9 are all similarly provided and preferably also, means is provided to respond to signals from the sensors 12 to automatically alter roller diameters. Figures 12, 13 and 14 show schematically the invention utilized in different systems operating behind a face mining machine or the like. The invention is equally applicable to convey products from, say, an in pit semimobile crusher, in which the conveyor ramps out of the pit on a convenient segmental spiral pattern as shown in Figure 15. As can be seen in Figure 15 it is obvious that by consecutive application of the principles of the invention, any angle up to 360 and beyond can be turned. It will be equally obvious that serpentine angles to either side can be turned within one conveyor flight. It will be clear that the invention is also applicable to conditions in which the static and swingable frames 2, 1 are mounted at a fixed angle for relatively long periods of time. In some applications, where headroom is severely restricted, for example low seam underground conveying, the upper and lower pairs of rollers 5,6 and 8,9 may be displaced longitudinally see Figure 16 with respect to one another and to pivot about their individual pivot axes for bend roller pairs shown as center lines and their mountings modified to accommodate for the repositioning. Figure 17 shows an embodiment in which conveying is effected in the reverse direction to that of Figure 1 and Figure 18 shows an embodiment in which material is conveyed in both directions simultaneously. Figures 19 and 20 illustrate a mobile belt bending machine for up to 90 angles in which two swingable portions 2a and 2b are mounted to the central fixed frame 1 which is mobile by means of tracks 20. All other details including compensation means for roller pairs are as previously described. In Figure 21, a belt bending arrangement comprising a frame 200 mounted for movement on endless tracks 202 carries a swingable frame 201 mounted for swinging in the horizontal plane with respect to the frame 200. Two pairs of belt bending rollers 205, 206 and 208, 209 are provided to bend the conveyor belt 210 through an angle of up to, say, 45 see Figure 22 . The frame 201 pivots about its pivot center line 212 and carries the pulley 205 of the pulley pair 205, 206 and the pulley 208 of the pulley pair 208, 209 so that pulleys pivot with respect to their pair 206 and 209.As in all preceding configurations means is provided to vary the distance between the external roller surfaces of the pair 205, 206 and of the pair 208, 209, longitudinally of the direction of movement of the belt 210 to compensate for the relative swinging movement of the rollers 205, 208 relative to the other half of their pairs 206, 209. This can conveniently be done by moving at least one or the other of each pair longitudinally of the direction of movement of the belt by a suitable arrangement on either one or both of the frames 200, 201. The swingable frame 201 overhangs in cantilever fashion behind the frame 200 and carries the chute 212 of a hopper arrangement 214. Additionally the swinging frame 201 carries conveyed material transfer pulley system 220, 221, 222 over which the incoming material carrying belt run 224 of the belt 210 passes. Material coming from the right hand side of the Figure on the belt 210 arrives at the belt bending arrangement and the incoming run 224 passes over the first 220 of the pulleys of the transfer system and discharges the conveyed material into the chute 212 of the hopper 214. The run 224 having passed around the pulley 222 then enters the belt bending arrangement and passes over the bending pulleys 205, 206 to provide an outgoing run 226 which is a continuation of the incoming belt run 224.The hopper 214 feeds the material transferred into its chute 212 back onto the outgoing run 226 of the belt 210 which then proceeds to the left for discharge. The return run 230 of the belt 210 passes through frame 200 over rollers 232, 234 from where a run 226 proceeds to a conventional tail pulley remote from the belt bending arrangement. The run 227 returns from the tail pulley passes over a pulley 228 on the frame 200 and then over the bending roller pair 209, 208 where it returns along run 229 to a second remote tail pulley mounted for longitudinal and or transverse motions suitable to the application. It will be clear from this description that the belt bending arrangement of Figures 21 and 22 may readily be inserted into an existing conveyor belt system to enable bending of that system conveniently at horizontal angles of up to 450. Referring now to Figures 23 through 26, Figures 23 and 24 show schematically an alternative arrangement to that shown in Figures 19 and 20 and suitable for use in situations where head room is limited and where horizontal bend angles of up to 90 will be required. A frame 300 is movably mounted on endless tracks 302 and has a swingable second frame 301 mounted thereon for swinging movement in a horizontal plane thereto. The second frame 301, in its turn has a further frame 302 mounted thereon for swinging thereabout in a horizontal plane see Figure 24 . The frame 302 carries roller 305 of roller pair 305, 306 and roller 308 of roller pair 308, 309 so that the rollers 305, 308 may rotate relative to the other half of their pairs 306, 309 respectively. The frame 301 carries the rollers 309, 306 and additionally carries the roller 306 of the roller pair 305 , 306 and the roller 309 of the roller pair 309 , 308 so that rollers 306 , 309 may rotate relatively to the other halves of their roller pairs 305 , 308 . 305 and 308 are carried on frame 300. As before it is to be understood that means is provided to vary the distance between the external roller surfaces of the rollers of each of the pairs in the system, longitudinally of the direction of movement of the belt to compensate for relative swinging movement of the rollers of each pair.Conveniently this may be accomplished by providing means for adjusting movement longitudinally of the direction of belt movement of at least one or the other of each of said pairs. To this end suitable mountings may be provided on one or both of frames 300, 301 or one or both of frames 301, 302. The center line of pivot of the rollers 305, 306 308, 309 305 , 306 and 308 , 309 are shown as such. It is understood that one skilled in the art could design other structural frame arrangements than frames 300, 301 and 302 which would still satisfy the geometrical relationships of the bending roller pairs and the incoming and outgoing runs of belting.In operation conveyed material moving from right to left as seen inFigure 23 provides an incoming carrying belt run 324 which enters a conveyed material transfer pulley system 320, 321, 322, the material being discharged from the belt run 324 close to the pulley 320 into a hopper 314. The belt run 324 has a substantially flat section near the transfer pulley 320 and this section is suitable to mount belt cleaning scrapers or cleaners. A spiral self cleaning roller could be provided at the bend position to further clean the belt. This cleaning is important where wet or sticky materials are being handled and serves to clean the belt before entering the bending rollers 305, 306. The belt passes around roller 322, and then over the bending rollers 305, 306 where it is bent through an angle of, say, up to 45 about the pivot axis.The belt then passes over the roller 306 and over the roller 305 and is bent through a further, say 45 about the pivot axis of the pulley 306 , 305 . After that the belt passes over pulleys 350, 351, 352, and 353 to provide an outgoing belt run 326 which is of course a continuation of the incoming belt 324.Material from the hopper 314 is deposited on outgoing belt run 326 which proceeds from right to left clear of the frame 300 and on to a remote discharge point. The return belt run 330 enters the frame 300 and passes over rollers 356, 357 and out to the right as seen in Figure 23 to a conventional tail section where it is reversed and returned to the belt bending arrangement. The belt passes over the rollers 358 and 359 to the belt bending roller pairs 308 and 309 where it undergoes an up to 450 bend about the pivot axis of the rollers 308 , 309 and after proceeding through rollers 309, 308 it experiences a further bend of up to 450 about the pivot axis of rollers 308, 309. From thence it passes to the right as seen in Figure 23 to a second remote tail pulley.In Figure 24 it will be seen that the belt 310 passes through a full 90 turn from where it enters the belt bender arrangement from the bottom of the page as seen in Figure 24 out to the left. It is clear that the belting runs to the conventional tail pulley are enabled by the pulley combination 356, 357 and 358, 359 which deflect the return run 330 under the belt bending machine to the remote tail pulley location and receive it back into the belt bending machine again prior to entering the first belt bending roller 308, for the return run. In some applications, it will be advantageous to omit pulleys 356, 357 and 358, 359 providing only such deflection pulleys as will be required to enable belting run 330 to enter the first belt bending roller 308 directly from the left side of the figure. In such a case, the ground loop and conventional tail pulley do not exist only the remote auxiliary tail pulley associated with the loading point of belting run 324 will be used. In Figures 25 and 26 there is shown an arrange ment where the embodiment according to Figures 23 and 24 may be used with an existing ground loop system to provide for an additional input to the system along the line of the original conveyor. A trip car 400 mounted on wheels 401 provides for material conveyed on the belt 410 to be carried through a material transfer run 424 which passes over a transfer pulley system 420, 421 and 422 to discharge material into the hopper 314 adjacent the roller 320. Thereafter material from both the belt 410 and the belt 310, before it turns through the right angle to the left as seen in Figure 26 is conveyed on the belt 310 for discharge. The belt 410 after passing through the pulleys 420, 421 and 422 moves from right to left and thereafter enters pulleys 358 and 359 of the belt bending machine as shown in Figure 23. The novelty of the arrangement of Figures 25 and 26 is seen particularly in that on one continuous conveyor flight there is provided independent means to load output from, for example, two mining machines for combined ore transportation to the discharge point, at least one of such mining machines operating in a remote location in a horizontal sense from the centre line of the conveyor system.
