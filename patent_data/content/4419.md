# Method of manufacturing an actuator rod.

## Abstract
A method of producing pneumatic brake actuator rods in which a spigot 22 is provided at one end for mounting a pressure plate 7 and a thread 21 is provided on the output end, the body of the rod around the root of the spigot being under cut and thereafter upset by rollswaging or other means to produce a flange 32 for supporting the rod against the pressure plate 7 so that the rod can be of generally substantially reduced diameter in relation to that used for many years hitherto.
