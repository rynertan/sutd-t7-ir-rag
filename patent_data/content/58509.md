# Semiconductor circuit for driving clock signal line.

## Abstract
A semiconductor circuit for driving a clock signal line comprising a first circuit for pulling up the potential of the clock signal line to the source voltage, a second circuit for pulling down the potential of the clock signal line to a lower voltage, and a capacitor connected to the clock signal line for receiving a potential push signal and pushing the potential of the clock signal line up to higher than the source voltage, the capacitor being able to perform the function of capacitance only after the potential of the clock signal line is raised to the source voltage, whereby the operational speed of a dynamic memory device associated with the semiconductor device is enhanced.
