# Solar cell incorporating a photoactive compensated intrinsic amorphous silicon layer and an insulating layer and method of fabrication thereof.

## Abstract
An amorphous silicon solar cell which minimizes back diffusion of holes into an N type layer of hydrogenated amorphous silicon incident to solar radiation and which has a photoactive intrinsic layer matched more closely to the ideal bandgap for increased absorption of solar radiation is characterised by having a photoactive compensated intrinsic hydrogenated amorphous silicon layer 16 incorporating N type and P type dopants in an amount sufficient to reduce the bandgap of the layer, preferably to below about 1.6 eV, while maintaining a recombination lifetime of holes and electrons which is greater than their transit time out of the layer during solar illumination, and by having an insulating layer 18 between said layer 16 and the incident N type layer 20 . Fabrication of the solar cell is advantageously effected in a glow discharge apparatus.
