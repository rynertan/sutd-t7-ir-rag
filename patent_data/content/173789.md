# PROCESS FOR PRODUCING EMULSION OF VINYL RESIN HAVING MICROVOIDS THEREIN, AND PROCESS FOR ITS POWDERIZATION

## Abstract
A process for producing an emulsion of a vinyl resin having microvoids therein, which comprises using as seed particles 0.1 to 90 parts by weight as solids of a polymer emulsion C obtained by emulsion polymerization of a polymerizable monovinyl monomer A and optionally, a polyfunctional crosslinkable monomer B , adding to said seed particles a monomeric mixture which is composed of 99.9 to 10 parts by weight of a polymerizable monovinyl monomer D and 0 to 50 parts by weight of a polyfunctional crosslinkable monomer E and the solubility parameter of which differs from the solubility parameter of the polymer C by at least 0.1, and emulsion polymerizing the monomeric mixture. The resulting resin emulsion may be powderized by drying.
