# Process for forming a refractory fiber article and article obtained by said process.

## Abstract
An inorganic refractory insulation article comprising randomly oriented refractory fibers retained by dried colloidal silica uniformly distributed throughout the article and containing from about 0.001 to about 1.5 percent by weight of the article of aluminium chlorhydrate. The invention further comprises the process for making the article by forming a fiber mat from a fiber slurry, impregnating the mat with a conditioned colloidal silica composition comprising colloidal silica, acid, aluminium chlorhydrate and water and drying the mat to form the article.
