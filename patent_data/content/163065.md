# Self pivoting robotic manipulator.

## Abstract
Robotic manipulator comprising a tool 11 pivoting under the force of gravity to orient itself to enable the actuation of selected gripping surfaces 26, 27 . The self pivoting action is accomplished solely by the force of gravity acting upon the mass distribution of the tool with respect to the pivot axis of the tool 11 . Several different gripping surfaces 26, 27 are provided on the tool 11 whereby time consuming tool changes are substantially eliminated. The gripper tool is pivotally connected to a robotic arm. By pitching the robotic arm, the self pivoting tool 11 will be positioned by the gravitational force acting upon it.
