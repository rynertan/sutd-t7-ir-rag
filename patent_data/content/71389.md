## Abstract
A relatively low cost, lightweight vehicle 1 has a traction belt drive system, a force spreading air bag suspen sion, and operational efficiency features. The traction belt 5 cooperates with track wheel assemblies 70 on each side of the vehicle to spread the suspension forces and to provide efficient steering ability. Each traction belt can be in the form of a Moebius strip. The air bag suspension 6 uses integral air bags 72 on each side of the vehicle cooperative with plural flaps 71 pivotable on a central keel to spread varying suspension forces and to smooth the ride over a variety of terrains.
