# Hollow Shaped catalytic extrudates.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to novel cross section shapes which are employed to form catalytic extrudates which may be employed in catalytically promoted pro cesses including hydrocarbon processing operations. Such shapes include essentially rectangular shaped tubes, and triangular shaped tubes in cross section.
