## Description
The present invention relates to a method for producing a grain oriented electrical steel sheet having a low watt loss, wherein the magnetic characteristics are not impaired even by stress relief annealing. In recent years, from a viewpoint of saving energy, it has been desired to reduce watt loss in electrical steel sheets. As a method for reducing the watt loss, a subdivision of magnetic domains by laser irradiation has already been disclosed in Japanese Examined Patent Publication Kokoku No. 58 26405. The reduction of watt loss by this method is due to strains introduced by laser irradiation. Therefore, the method can be applied to a laminated core type transformer wherein no stress relief annealing is necessary, but cannot be applied to a wound core type transformer wherein stress relief annealing is necessary. Also, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication Kokai No. 59 100222 discloses a method wherein a steel sheet subjected to secondary recrystallization annealing is locally heat treated and annealed at a temperature of 800 C or higher, whereby grain boundaries are artificially introduced. In this method, the reduction of watt loss value is achieved by the subdivision of magnetic domains by the artificial grain boundaries introduced into the steel sheet. The watt loss reduction effect does not disappear even upon stress relief annealing, because the steel sheet is annealed at a temperature of 800 c or higher. However, the disclosed examples indicate it is difficult to obtain a watt loss comparable with that in the above mentioned method for reducing the watt loss value by laser irradiation. The present invention provides a grain oriented electrical steel sheet having a low watt loss, wherein the magnetic characteristics are not impaired even upon stress relief annealing, through simultaneously resolving the difficulties arising because, when stress relief annealed, the reduction of watt loss cannot be achieved because the introduced strains disappear and because, even though the watt loss reduction effect does not disappear upon stress relief annealing, a watt loss value comparable with that of the laser irradiation method cannot be obtained. The present invention comprises a method for producing a grain oriented electrical steel sheet having a low watt loss, wherein grooves of depth more than 5 µm and a width of from 10 to 300 µm are formed on an electrical steel sheet that has been final texture annealed, or final texture annealed and then subjected to an insulation coating treatment, by locally loading at a mean load of from 90 to 220 kg mm² at an angle in a range of from a right angle to 45 to a rolling direction, and then said steel sheet is heat treated at a temperature of at least 750 C, so that fine recrystallised grains are formed within the crystal grains to cause a sub division of the magnetic domains. Thus, the present invention provides a grain oriented electrical steel sheet having an excellent watt loss value comparable with or lower than that of the laser irradiation method even when subjected to a stress relief annealing. The present invention will be described in detail below. A slab containing Si up to 4 is heated and hot rolled to an intermediate thickness. The hot rolled steel sheet is subjected to pickling, heated treated in accordance with a need therefor at this stage, and then cold rolled twice with an intermediate annealing or once to a final sheet thickness. The cold rolled steel sheet is subjected to a usual process whereby the grain oriented electrical steel sheet is produced which consists of the steps of decarburisation annealing, annealing separator application, and secondary recrystallization annealing. The steel sheet may be then applied with a coating liquid for forming a phosphoric acid tension imparting coating or other insulation coatings, and baked. The thus obtained steel sheet is given a working at a load of 90 to 220 kg mm² in terms of the mean load at the stress applied sites the quotient of the applied stress divided by the stress imparted area on the steel sheet viewed normally to the sheet surface the stress imparted area on the sheet surface after stress impartation . The present inventors found that locally loading the above mentioned steel sheet causes a generation of fine grains at the strain introduced sites and that the size of the fine grains, i.e., the magnitude of loading, has a close relationship to the watt loss value and the magnetic flux density. Figure 1 is a graph showing the relationship between the mean load for introducing strains into a steel body and magnetic characteristics Fig. 2 is a photograph showing a metallurgical microstructure at a strain introduced site after heat treatment Fig. 3 is a photograph by scanning electron microscope showing a crystal structure of the magnetic domains at a strain introduced site Figs. 4 and 5 are graphs showing the relationship between the width of a groove formed on a steel sheet and magnetic characteristics Fig. 6 is a graph showing the relationship between the load for introducing strains and the depth of the groove and Figs. 7 and 8 are graphs showing variations of the magnetic characteristics before and after the strain introduction and those after the heat treatment. Figure 1 shows the relation of the imparted mean stress to the watt loss and the magnetic flux density. As shown in this figure, it is obvious that both the watt loss W₁₇ ₅₀ W kg and the magnetic flux density B₈ T are good values when the mean load falls in the range from 90 to 220 kg mm². That is, when the mean load is less than 90 kg mm², the amount of strain introduced is too small to generate fine grains or, even if fine grains are generated, the magnetic domain subdividing effect is weak. On the other hand, the amount of strain introduced when 220 kg mm² is exceeded is so excessive that the recrystallized grains out of Goss orientation at the strain introduced sites grow with the resulting reduction of the magnetic flux density. The most preferable range of the mean load is from 120 to 180 kg mm². Figure 2 shows a state of the fine grains generated at the strain introduced sites after introducing strain and heat treating. The photograph was taken at a magnification of 320. The mean load was 130 kg mm² and heat treatment was performed at 850 C for 4 hours. The size of these fine grains is 100 µm. Nuclei to subdivide the magnetic domains are generated at the interfaces between these fine grains and the secondary recrystallized grains. The nuclei of magnetic domains generated from these grains were 2 to 3 mm long. When fine grains such as seen in Fig. 2 are generated, the reduction of magnetic flux density is small and, further, the watt loss value is considerably improved by the generation of nuclei of magnetic domains. When grains so grow as to penetrate the thickness of sheet, the magnetic flux density is considerably lowered. According to the present invention, a B₈ of 1.878 T or more and a B₁₀ of 1.89T or more can be obtained without significantly impairing the magnetic flux density, and there is a feature that the fine grains with a proper size can be introduced into the secondary recrystallized grains. Figure 3 shows a state of the subdivision of magnetic domains. The photograph was taken at a magnification of 7. This figure shows a state of the magnetic domains in the steel sheet by a scanning electron microscope, where it is seen that the nuclei of magnetic domains are generated at the strain introduced sites and thereby the magnetic domains are subdivided. The optimum shape of the stress imparted portion or groove by such an impartation of mean load onto the steel sheet is as follows First, the interval of grooves in the rolling direction is preferably from 1 to 20 mm. The most preferable range is from 2.5 to 10 mm, in which range the watt loss value is effectively reduced. As indicated, the width of the grooves is in the range from 10 to 300 µm. If the grooves are too narrow, a notch effect will result in an easy breaking when subjected to a bending working at a small curvature of radius. On the other hand, if the grooves are too wide, the magnetic flux density will be lowered. Preferably, the width of grooves is from 10 to 150 µm. When a gear type roll is used to form grooves, from the viewpoint of magnetic characteristics, the gear tip may be flat, with a curvature of radius, or sharp, but is not preferably such as well cause a stress concentration at the grooves when subjected to bending working. However, this limitation does not apply when bending working is not performed. When bending working is to be applied, the shape of the groove root is preferably flat or with a curvature of radius. Figures 4 and 5 show the relation of the above mentioned width of groove to the watt loss and the magnetic flux density. Figure 4 shows the relationship between the width of groove mm and magnetic characteristics under the conditions of a steel sheet thickness of 0.23 mm, a mean load of 100 kg mm², an interval of grooves of 5 mm, a gear tip having a flat shape, and heat treatment at 850 C for 4 hours, which shows that the optimum range of the width of groove is up to 0.3mm. Figure 5 shows the relationship between the width of groove and magnetic characteristics under the conditions of a steel sheet thickness of 0.23mm, a mean load of 200 kg mm² , an interval of grooves of 7mm, a flat shape gear tip, and heat treatment at 850 C for 4 hours, which shows that the optimum range of the width of groove is up to 0.15mm. That is, the width of groove varies according to the load and when the width is increased excessively, grains out of Goss orientation at the strain introduced sites grow with a resulting impairment of magnetic characteristics. Thus, when the mean load is from 90 to 220 kg mm² , the preferable width of the groove is 300 µm or less and the minimum width upon working is 10µm. The depth of the grooves into the steel body is more than 5 µm. The depth increases with the increasing load imparted on the steel sheet. Figure 6 shows the relationship between the mean load and the depth of groove under the conditions of a steel sheet thickness of 0.23 mm, a width of groove of 50µm, and a flat shape gear tip, which shows that, when the mean load is from 90 to 220 kg mm² , the depth of groove is from 5 to 20 µm. Grooves are directed at an angle between 45 and a right angle to the rolling direction 001 orientation . An excessively large angle will cause a disadvantage in the reduction of the watt loss value. The groove may be in the form of a dotted, broken, or solid line. The interval of dots or lines in the direction perpendicular to the rolling direction is preferably 0.1 mm or less. When the interval exceeds this value, the magnetic domain subdividing effect of the fine grains formed by strain introduction is decreased. In the present invention, the strain introduction by load impartation is followed by heat treatment at a temperature of 750 C or higher. Figures 7 and 8 show the variation of the watt loss value W₁₇ ₅₀ W kg upon heat treatment after the strain introduction. As seen from these figures, the watt loss value is once impaired after the strain introduction compared with that before the strain introduction, but is extremely improved by a short time heat treatment. This makes it possible to reduce the watt loss value before stress relief annealing, by introducing strain after final texture annealing and then performing the recrystallization at the strain introduced sites by utilizing the heat treatment upon baking of an insulation coating subsequent to the strain introduction. Therefore, the method according to the present invention can also apply, of course, to the materials for the laminated core type transformer use in which the stress relief annealing is not performed. Additionally, supposing a short time heat treatment is performed on a continuous line, the upper limit to the heat treatment temperature will preferably be 850 C. At temperatures exceeding 850 C in a continuous line, the sheet tension causes an elongation. Further, since the watt loss value is stable even after a long time heat treatment, the method according to the present invention preferably applies to the materials for the wound core type transformer use in which a long time stress relief annealing is performed. Figure 7 corresponds to the case of a sheet thickness of 0.23 mm, a B₈ of 1.94 T before the strain introduction , and a strain introducing load of 150 kg mm². Figure 8 corresponds to the case of a sheet thickness of 0.23 mm, a B₈ of 1.95T before the strain introduction , and a strain introducing load of 165 kg mm². Although a gear type roll is used to form grooves in this example, any other methods may be applied provided they can locally impose the load according to the present invention. Additionally, when the steel sheet is locally loaded, it is practically suitable to have the steel sheet maintained at a temperature of from 50 to 500 C, since this makes it difficult for twins to be formed, and thereby the magnetic characteristics are improved. The steel sheet with a final texture annealing coating or a phosphoric acid tension imparting coating has here been described, considering the most economical manufacturing. However, the watt loss reduction effect also can be expected when the method according to the present invention is applied to the secondarily recrystallized steel sheet which has no coating. The phosphoric acid tension imparting coatings mean the coatings formed by using the coating forming liquid containing as indispensable components phosphorate, colloidal silica, and chromic acid or anhydrous chromic acid. Below, the examples according to the present invention will be described. A final texture annealed grain oriented electrical steel sheet which was finish rolled to a thickness of 0.23 mm by single cold rolling was applied with a phosphoric acid tension imparting coating solution and then subjected to baking. Strain was introduced to the steel sheet by means of a gear type roll with a gear pitch of 5 mm, an edge width at gear tip of 50 µm, a flat shape gear tip, and an edge angle of 75 to the rolling direction, under an applied load of 130 kg mm². A grain oriented electrical steel sheet which had been finish rolled to a thickness of 0.23 µm by single cold rolling, was final texture annealed. Strain was introduced to the steel sheet by means of a gear type roll with a gear pitch of 8 mm, a curvature of radius at gear tip of 100 µm, and an edge angle of 75 to the rolling direction, under an applied load of 180 kg mm². This caused grooves about 14 µm deep. The steel sheet after the strain introduction was applied with a phosphoric acid tension imparting coating solution and then subjected to heat treatment at 800 C for 4 hours. Table 2 shows the watt loss values of the above processed steel sheet and the comparative sample. The steel sheet processed according to the present invention has an extremely excellent watt loss value even after heat treatment. A grain oriented electrical steel sheet which had been finish rolled to a thickness of 0.30 mm by single cold rolling was final texture annealed. Strain was introduced to the steel sheet by means of a gear type roll with a gear pitch of 7 mm, an edge width at gear tip of 150 µm, a flat shape gear tip, and an edge angle of 60 to the rolling direction, under an applied load of 200 kg mm². The steel sheet after the strain introduction was applied with a phosphoric acid tension imparting coating solution and then subjected to heat treatment at 850 C for 5 min. Table 3 shows the watt loss values of the above processed steel sheet and the comparative sample. A grain oriented electrical steel sheet which had been finish rolled to a thickness of 0.20 mm by single cold rolling was final texture annealed. Strain was introduced to the steal sheet by means of a gear type roll with a gear pitch of 8 mm, a curvature of radius at gear tip of 100 µm, an edge angle of 15 to the axial direction of gear, under an applied load of 150 kg mm². The temperatures of the steel sheet upon the strain introduction were 1 room temperature, 2 200 C, and 3 400 C. The steel sheet after the strain introduction was applied with a phosphoric acid tension imparting coating solution and then subjected to heat treatment at 850 C for 30 sec followed by stress relief annealing at 800 C for 4 hours. Table 4 shows the magnetic characteristics in the above case. A grain oriented electrical steel sheet which had been finished rolled to a thickness of 0.23 µm by single cold rolling was final texture annealed. Strain was introduced to the steel sheet by means of a gear type roll with a gear pitch of 5 mm, an edge width at gear tip of 50 µm, a flat shape gear tip, and an edge angle of 75 to the rolling direction, under an applied load of 130 kg mm². The steel sheet after the strain introduction was subjected to stress relief annealing at a temperature of 800 C for 2 hours. Table 5 shows the watt loss values W₁₇ ₅₀ W kg corresponding to the conventional method and the method of the present invention. According to the present invention, an extremely excellent watt loss value is obtained. The steel sheet obtained by the method according to the present invention shows an extremely excellent watt loss value. Therefore, the present invention enables an electrical steel sheet having a low watt loss value to be obtained through a continuous line. According to the present invention, a watt loss value comparable to that obtained by laser irradiation can be obtained even when stress relief annealing is performed. Therefore, the thus obtained electrical steel sheet can be used for the laminated core type transformer as well as for the wound core type transformer. Thus, the present invention will contribute greatly to the industry.
