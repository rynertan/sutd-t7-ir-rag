# Method for addition of low melting point metal to molten steel.

## Abstract
A method of adding a low melting point metal e.g. Pb or Bi to liquid steel for producing a free cutting steel in a consistent manner and in high yield of addition is disclosed. In accordance with the method, at least one member selected from said low melting point metal and an oxide thereof, and at least one member selected from the group consisting of quick lime and a carbonaceous material are mixed in specified optimum proportions and the mixture is blown into the liquid steel through an injection lance. The liquid steel may be agitated while the mixture is added, and the appropriate conditions for the agitation of the steel are also specified.
