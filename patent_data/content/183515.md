## Description
This invention relates to raster width regulation in a television or other video display system. High resolution video display monitors are used to display computer graphics information in such systems as computer aided design and computer aided manufacturing systems. In such high resolution display systems, which may operate at a line scan frequency which is a multiple of a standard television line frequency, it is desirable to minimize, to the greatest practical extent, display distortion of the video graphics or other information. One source of display distortion is raster width deflection sensitivity. Line deflection sensitivity depends on the magnitude of the ultor voltage being supplied to the final anode electrode of the picture tube in the display monitor, and depends upon the amplitude of the line scanning current. The amount of electron beam line deflection or throw angle increases with decreasing ultor voltage and with increasing line scanning current amplitude. Beam current loading of the ultor terminal varies with changes in the information content of the video signal. Bright display areas produce increased beam current loading of the ultor terminal, whereas dark display areas produce reduced beam current loading. Increased beam current loading of the ultor terminal tends to decrease the ultor output voltage, and therefor tends to increase the amount of electron beam line deflection and raster width. It is a feature of the invention to provide compensation for undesirable raster width variations that tend to produce distortion of the displayed video information. It is another feature of the invention to provide fine or accurate raster width compensation or regulation that satisfies the stringent requirements of a high resolution display system. In accordance with an aspect of the invention, apparatus for regulating raster width includes a line deflection voltage regulator that is responsive to control signals for developing a first regulated voltage. A line deflection circuit is coupled to the line deflection voltage regulator for generating line scanning current in a line deflection winding. The amplitude of the scanning current is dependent on the first regulated voltage. A high voltage regulator is responsive to control signals for developing a second regulated voltage. A high voltage generator is coupled to the high voltage regulator for generating a ultor output voltage at an ultor terminal. The magnitude of the ultor output voltage is dependent on the second regulated voltage. A high voltage control circuit is coupled in a feedback path between the high voltage generator and the high voltage regulator for developing a first ultor control signal that is representative of the ultor output voltage to regulate the ultor output voltage. A voltage developing circuit is coupled to the feedback path for developing a second ultor control signal that is representative of fluctuations in ultor output voltage. The second control signal is applied to the line deflection voltage regulator to vary the first regulated voltage for providing raster width regulation. By having a separate high voltage generator to develop the ultor voltage, rather than requiring the line deflection circuit to develop the ultor voltage, beam current loading of the ultor terminal does not produce concurrent direct loading of the line deflection circuit. Undesirable interaction is avoided, between the high voltage generator and the line deflection circuit, that tends to undesirably affect raster width regulation. Furthermore, the provision of a high voltage regulator and a separate line deflection voltage regulator enables separate, relatively independent control of two factors that determine deflection sensitivity, namely, the magnitude of the ultor voltage and the amplitude of the line scanning current. Thus, by supplying the line voltage regulator with a control voltage representative of ultor output voltage fluctuations, the amplitude of the scanning current may be varied to provide accurate raster width regulation to compensate for residual ultor voltage fluctuations that remain uncancelled by operation of the high voltage regulator. In the Drawing In the FIGURE, a switched mode power supply regulator 21 generates regulated supply voltages from an unregulated, mains derived voltage V Line deflection circuit 80 includes a horizontal oscillator 28 providing switching signals S, repeating at the line deflection frequency of, illustratively, 4 fH, where fH is a standard line deflection frequency of, for example, 15.75 kilohertz. Switching signals S are coupled to a driver stage 39 to produce line rate switching of a horizontal output transistor Q1 for generating line scanning current in a line deflection winding L Line deflection winding L The deflection retrace pulse voltage developed across line deflection winding L In accordance with an inventive feature, the function of high voltage generation is separated from the function of line deflection, with high voltage generator 70 being provided with its own power transformer T2. This arrangement eliminates the need for flyback transformer T1 and line deflection circuit 80 to supply power to the picture tube ultor load. Additionally, switched mode power supply regulator 21 is the power source for the other high power monitor load circuits, such as the vertical deflection and display tube driver circuits. Therefore, line deflection circuit 80 does not exhibit undesirable retrace pulse voltage load current modulation that could undesirably produce raster line distortion. No heavy, variable loading occurs on the retrace pulse voltage developed by line deflection winding L High voltage generator 70 comprises a switching power supply, operating on the same pulse principles as line deflection circuit 80, to produce a pulse voltage V To generate the pulse voltage V High voltage transformer T2 is operated in a flyback converter mode, with the inductance of primary winding W High voltage regulator 50 comprises, for example, a series pass regulator with the collector of a series pass transistor Q9 coupled to the B terminal via a current limiting resistor R1, and with the emitter coupled to output terminal 23 via an overcurrent sampling resistor R2 and an LC filter network 22. The base and emitter electrodes of an overcurrent limiting transistor Q5 are coupled to respective end terminals of a sampling resistor R2. The collector electrode of transistor Q5 is coupled to the base of transistor Q9. A controllable current source 30 provides base current to series pass regulating transistor Q9 for controlling conduction of the transistor under normal operating conditions in accordance with a control signal current i A based current for controlling conduction in series pass transistor Q9 is supplied from controllable current source 30 in accordance with the value of the control current i Excessive current may flow from output terminal 23 into winding W To enable high voltage regulator 50 to provide regulation of the ultor voltage at terminal U, control transistor Q11 is a circuit element in a negative feedback path that couples the output of high voltage generator 70, at terminal U, for example, to the control input terminal 51 of high voltage regulator 50. The circuit elements of the feedback path include a voltage divider 90, coupled to ultor terminal U, and a comparator U2 having an inverting input terminal coupled to a junction terminal 91 of voltage divider 90 and having an output terminal coupled to control transistor Q11. In operation, feedback voltage V An adjustable DC control voltage, developed at the wiper arm of an extra high tension adjustment potentiometer 42, is coupled to the noninverting input terminal of comparator U2 to adjust the magnitude of the ultor voltage. Voltage divider 90 includes resistive voltage dividing elements, resistor 25 and resistor 26, that produce the DC and long term average value of the feedback voltage V Changes in the long term average value of the ultor voltage may occur due to long term beam current loading of ultor terminal U due to changes in the overall or average brightness of the video information being displayed on the raster. Such overall or average brightness changes occur over the interval of several video field periods or field deflection cycles. If left uncompensated, these long term average value changes in the ultor voltage produce a visually undesirable pulsation of the width of the entire raster. A second type of raster distortion is one that is caused by short term fluctuations in the ultor voltage. The duration of such short term fluctuations is typically less than one field period or less than one vertical deflection cycle. Such short term fluctuations in the ultor voltage may be caused by short term fluctuations in beam current loading of ultor terminal U when displaying, for example, a stationary display that includes both very bright regions and very dark regions. As the video lines for such a stationary display the displayed within one field, they will vary from lines that display bright video information to lines that display dark video information. These rapid changes in display of video information produce corresponding rapid fluctuations in beam current loading and in ultor voltage over one field interval. The result is that the width of the raster lines within one field also fluctuates in a corresponding manner to distort the display. In accordance with an inventive feature high voltage regulator 50 is also responsive to the short term fluctuations in ultor output voltage to correct for these fluctuations and maintain a relatively constant ultor voltage. In carrying out this feature, voltage divider 90 includes a capacitor 27 coupled between voltage divider junction terminal 91 and ultor terminal U Short term fluctuations in the ultor voltage are directly coupled, relatively unattenuated, to terminal 91 to develop short term fluctuations in the feedback voltage V The short term fluctuations in the feedback voltage V In accordance with another aspect of the invention, line deflection voltage regulator 60 is also responsive to the ultor output voltage to vary the regulated scan supply voltage V Control input terminal 61 is the summing point for various control signals that are used to regulate the scan supply voltage V A second control voltage applied to control input terminal 61 is obtained from a vertical parabola generator 31, of well known design. Vertical parabola generator 31 supplies a side pincushion correction voltage V To control horizontal width of the raster, an adjustable DC control voltage is developed at the wiper arm of a potentiometer 38 and is coupled to the noninverting input terminal of comparator U1. In accordance with a feature of the invention, line deflection voltage regulator 60 is made responsive to fluctuations in the ultor output voltage to achieve highly accurate raster width compensation. Depending on the loop gain for the ultor feedback voltage V To correct for the residual distortion, the error voltage V The regulated scan supply voltage V Assume, for example, that the ultor output voltage fluctuation is in the direction to decrease the ultor voltage. This decrease tends to increase the raster width. The accompanying decrease in ultor feedback voltage V An advantage of using the output of high voltage regulator comparator U2 as the input to line deflection voltage regulator comparator U1 to provide the mechanism for additional raster width correction, is that the impedances between the output terminal of comparator U2 and the input terminal of comparator U1 may be readily matched and proper signal bias levels may be readily achieved. An alternative way of obtaining ultor feedback voltage V It is desirable to use an ultor sense voltage that is directly representative of the ultor voltage, such as ultor feedback voltage V It is desirable to use such a direct representation sense voltage to permit the amplitude of the line scanning current to track the fluctuations in ultor voltage. Such tracking is necessary to maintain a constant deflection sensitivity. For example, for a relatively small fluctuation, δU, in the ultor voltage, the change in amplitude δI Using a sampling resistor in the current path of high voltage winding W
