# Apparatus for controlling continuously variable transmission used in vehicle.

## Abstract
A continuously variable transmission CVT for use in a vehicle is controlled such that an actual engine speed Ne is equalized to a desired engine speed No. When a driver s request for a rapid speed change of the vehicle is address ed, a desired engine speed Ns for steady state or the de sired engine speed No before the request is detected, is defined as a first value No1. While the request continues the desired engine speed Ns for steady state which is deter mined by current values of vehicle running parameters is defined as a second value No2. The product B No2 No1 of a constant B and No2 minus No1 is calculated and defined as a desired engine speed during the request.
