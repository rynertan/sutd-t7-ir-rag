## Description
process for the preparation of a segmented thermoplastic elastomer.The invention relates to a process for the preparation of a segmented thermoplastic elastomer, by convqrsion in a melt system of 2. one or more OH and or COOH groups containing bifunctional poly esters oe polyester having a melting point not higher than 100 C and a moleculair weight in the range of 500 to 5000, and b. one or more OB and or COOB groups containing bifunctional poly esters or polyester amides having a melting point not lower than 1800C and a molecular weight in the range of 500 to 5000 in the presence of such an amount of diisocyanate that the ratio between the number of NCO groups and functional groups of both the low melting and the high melting compounds is at least 1,0 and at most 1,5. x process of the type indicated above is described in United StatesPatent Speqification 4 102 868.According to the known process a powder of a dihydroxy polyester having a melting point not lower than 200 C and molecular weight in the range of 500 to 12000 is suspended in the prepolymer of a dihydroxy polyester having a melting point not higher than 1000C and a molecular weight in the range of 500 to 12000 and an organic diiso caranate, and the resulting suspension is heated to above the melting point of the powder until a linear polyurethane has formed. In a pre ferred embodiment the reaction mixture is passed in the shortest possible time 15 minutes or less through a zone heated to 280 C. Although the known process leads to thermoplastic polyurethanes having elastomeric properties, it is not considered to be quite suitable for use on an industrial scale. In the first place the highmelting polyester prepared by transesterification should be cooled and formed into a powder. In the second place the residence time of the reaction mixture in the hot zone is so critical that a salt excess of the residence time and or reaction temperature already leads to a greater or lesser degree of transesterification of the two polyester segments. This.means both a decrease in the melting point and an increase in he glass transition temperature of t sulting block copolymer. The invention consists in that in a process of the typ,e indicated above as known the transesterification catalyst present in one segment or in both is deactivated prior to the conversion process.As transesterification catalyst in the preparation of polyester generally a calcium salt, a manganese salt and or a zinc salt is used These salts may be deactivated by adding precipitating or complexing agents. Deactivation can also be effected by a thermal treatment. Thus, it has been found that when as catalyst zinc acetate is used, it is deactivated upon heating the reaction mixture to a temperature higher than 200 C. Particularly, it has been found that favourable results are obtained when use is made of complexing phosphorus compounds which are also suitable to be used as stabilizers in polyesters.In this connection mention is made of the phosphites and thiophosphites described in United States Patent Specification 3 039 993, the phosphates, phosphonates, phosphonic acids and phosphinic acids which correspond to the respective structural formulae EMI2.1 phosphate phosphonate phosphonic acid phosphinic acid where R, R1, R2 and R may be the same or different and represent a 3 hydrogen atom or a substituted or unsubstituted organic group. As examples of suitable substituents may be mentioned a lower alkyl group, alkoxy group, cycloalkyl group, cycloalkoxy group, hydroxyl group and or halogen atom. If R, R1, R2 or R3 represent an organic group, they generally contain not more than 30, and preferably not more than 18 carbon atoms. As examples may be mentioned alkyl, cycloalkyl, carboalkoxyalkyl, aryl, aralkyl and aroxyalkyl.As examples of very suitable phosphorus compounds may be mentioned triphenyl phosphate, triphenyl phosphite, triethyl phosphite, tricyclohexyl phosphite, tri 2 ethylhexyl trithiophosphite, trieicosyl phosphite, tri o chlorophenyl phosphite, 2 carbomethoxyethyl dimethyl phosphonate, hydroxymethyl phosphonic acid, diphenyl phosphinic acid, carboxymethyl phosphonic acid, carbethoxymethyl phosphonic acid, carboxyethyl phosphonic acid, tris triethylene glycol phosphate.and more particularly carbethoxymethyl diethyl phosphonate and tri p tert.butylphenyl phosphite.A particularly advantageous and rapid acting group of phosphorus compounds corresponds to the formula EMI3.1 where R1 and R2 may be the same or different and represent a hydrogen atom or an alkyl, cycloalkyl, aralkyl or aryl group each having not more than 20 carbon atoms, or the group OR3, where R3 represents a metal ion or an ammonium ion or the same group or the same atom asR1, irrespective of the meaning of R1 Generally it is desirable that the amount of phosphorus compound used for the deactivation should correspond to at least 0,5 phosphorus atoms per metal atom of the transesterification catalyst to be deactivated.The most favourable results are generally obtained if the phosphorus impound used for the deactivation is employed in an amount of 3 to is phosphorus atoms per metal atoms.As examples of suitable phosphorus compounds may be mentioned inorganic acids such as orthophosphoric acid, phosphorous acid or hypophosphorous acid phosphinic acids such as methylphosphinic acid, etylphosphinic acid, isobutylphosphinic acid, benzylphosphinic acid, p nylphosphinic acid, cyclohexylphosphinic acid or 4 methylphenylphosphinic acid phosphonic acids such as methylphosphonic acid, ethylphosphonic acid, isopr,pylphosphor.ic acid, isobutylphosphonic acid, benzylphosphonic acid, phenylphosphonic acid, cyclohexylphosphonic acid or 4 methylphenylphosphonic acid, the partial esters of said acids, particularly including the C1 20 alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl or aralkyl esters, such as for instance, the methyl, ethyl, propyl, cyclohexyl, phenyl or benzyl esters the partial metal salts of these acids, and more particularly the metals of groups I and II of the periodic system, such as sodium, potassium, calcium or magnesium and the partial ammonium salts of these acids.When use is made of a salt of calcium, manganese and or zinc as transesterification catalyse, it should be taken care that no antimony oxide is employed as polycondensation catalyst. In that case it is no longer or hardly found possible to obtain a deactivated prepolymer. According to the invention it is preferred that use should be made of polyesters or polyester amides whose preparation was carried out in the presence of a catalytic amount of a titanium catalyst. The advantage of a titanium catalyst is not only its high reactivity, but especially the ease with which this catalyst can be deactivated. As examples of suitable titanium catalysts may be mentioned esters of titanic acid and the neutralized products thereof, hydrogenated hexaalkoxy titanates of magnesium, titanyl oxalates, titanium halides, hydrolysed products of titanium halides, titanium hydroxide and titanium oxide hydrate. Preference is given to alkyl titanates such as tetramethyl titanate, tetraethyl titanate, tetrapropyl titanate or tetrabutyl titanate, the neutralized products thereof, the hydrogenated magnesium hexaalkoxy titanates, such as hydrogenated magnesium hexabutoxy titanate Mg HTi OC4Hg 6 2 t titanyl oxalate, calcium titanyl oxalate, titanium tetrachloride, the reaction product of titanium tetrachloride and hexane diol and the reaction product of titanium tetrachloride and water.Said titanium catalysts are used alone or in combination with magnesium acetate or calcium acetate. Inorganic titanates, such as lanthanum titanate, calcium acetate antimonytrioxide mixtures and lithium alkoxides and magnesium alko Xides are examples of other suitable catalysts. They are to be used in an amount which is generally in the range of 0,005 to 0,3 by weight, calculated on the components participating in the reaction. For a man skilled in the art it will not be difficuit to establish the amount of catalyst to be used for a given system. Many of the low melting polyesters or polyester amides suitable to be used in carrying out the process according to the invention are commercially available. It has been found that they generally con tain no or hardly any transesterification promoting catalysts. There fore, there is generally no need for deactivation of these low melting components. The high melting components, however, are gene rally prepared in the presence of a transesterification promoting catalyst. If the deactivating compound is a phosphorus compound, satisfactory results are generally obtained if the phosphorus com pound is introduced into the high melting polyester or the high melting polyester amide prior to the conversion process and the mixture is adept in the molten state for at least 5 minutes.It has been found that favourable results are always obtained if the high melting polyester or the high melting polyester amide with the phosphorus compound introduced into it are in the molten phase for a period in the range of 30 to 60 minutes.In carrying out the process according to the invention the general procedure is such that first a prepolymer is prepared by reacting the low melting polyester or the low melting polyester amide with the calculated amount of diisocyanate in a manner knov.n in itself, and the resulting prepolymer is reacted with the high melting polyester or polyester amide which is in the molten phase.The prepolymer is preferably so prepared that per 1,0 mole of bifunctional compound about 1,1 to 3,5 moles of diisocyanate are introduced into the reaction mixture.The reaction in the melt of the compound which is dehydrated for instance by heating it for about one hour at 100 to 150 C in vacuo at about 6 to 50 mm Hg with the diisocyan tes is carried out in a manner known in itself at about 800 1200C, and preferably 900 1100c, or in the presence of an inert solvent. As examples of suitable solvents may be mentioned methylene chloride, carbon tetrachloride, benzene, chlorobenzene, methylethyl ketone, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, glycol monomethyl ether acetate, glycol formal, dichlorobenzene, trichlorobenzene, nitrobenzene, benzoic methyl ester, acetophenone.Wnen the conversion takes place in solvents, particularly low boiling ones, such as methylene chloride, they may either be distilled off as the reaction proceeds, or the NCO prepolymer may remain dissolved in the solvent, for instance in dioxane, solutions of the NCO prepolymers generally being better processable, because of their low viscosity, than the melts. At elevated temperature 800 1000C also the solvent free melts of the NCO prepolymer have such viscosities as lead to rapid dissolving or intermixing upon further conversion.The resulting prepolymer of a temperature of about 900 1100C is subsequently added, with vigorous stirring, to the molten highmelting polyester or polyester amide and for some time kept at elevated temperature. When use is made of diisocyanate having a relatively high vapour pressure, such as diphenylmethane 4,4 diisocyanate MDI the procedure also may be such that first the high melting polyester or polyester amide is deactivated, and subsequently an excess of MDI is added to the melt, with vigorous stirring, after which the calculated amount of the low melting polyester or polyester amide is added.This method has the advantage that the preparation can take place in one and the same reactor.The composition of the thermoplastic elastomers prepared by the process according to the invention may be varied between very wide limits. Favourable results may be obtained if the reaction mixture is formed by 10 to 90 parts by weight of high melting polyester or polyester amide b and 90 to 10 parts by weight of low melting polyester or polyester amide a per 100 parts by weight of a b Preference is given to elastomers obtained by a process in which the reaction mixture consists of 40 to 80 parts by weight of polyester or polyester amide b, 60 to 10 parts by weight of polyester or polyester amide a and about 2 to about 15 parts by weight of a diisocyanate c per 100 parts by weight of a b c. Elastomers having optimum properties are generally obtained by using a process in which the high melting component has a melting point of at least 210 C and the low melting component has a melting point not higher than 60 C, and the temperature at which the prepolymer is converted with the high melting component is between at least 10 C above the melting point of the high melting component and 290 C. The highmelting polyesters are obtained by esterification of dicarboxylic acids with dialcohols or by transesterification of alkyl esters or hydroxy alkyl esters of dicarboxylic acids with dialcohols. The melting point of these polyesters is generally in the ranqe of 1800 to 2600C, and particularly in the range of 2000 to 2400C.As examples of aromatic acids which are suitable to be used as suchOr in the form of derivatives for the preparation of polyesters or polyester amides having a melting point above 180 C may be mentioned terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, diphenyl 4,4 dicarboxylic acid, diphenylsulphon 4,4 dicarboxylic acid, diphenyl ether 4,4 dicar boxylic acid, benzophenone 4,4 dicarboxylic acid, naphthalene 2,6 and 2,7 dicarboxylic acid, ethane diphenyl ether 4,4 dicarboxylic acid.As examples of dialcohols that are suitable to be used for esterification say be mentioned ethylene glycol, 1,3 propane diol, 1,4 butane diol, 1,6 hexane diol, 2,2 dimethyl 1,3 propane diol, diglycol, xylyler.e glycol 1,3 or 1,4 and 1,4 bisoxymethyl cyclohexane.Optionally, the high melting component may contain 50 mole per cent or non aromatic constituents. As examples of suitable non aromatic acids may be mentioned succinic acid, adipic acid, ether dipropionic acid, 1,4 cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid, 4 carboxyphenyl propionic acid and 1,4 phenylene ether diacetic acid. The non aromatic constituent itself may be a compound capable of reacting with a prepolymer formed from the low melting component and diisocyanate. It will they always be present baside one or more of said aromatic polyesters or polyester amides.As examples may be mentioned polyhydroxy compound, as well as dihydroxy amides, ureas or hydrazo dicarboxylic acid acides having a melting point not lower than 160 C, such as diphen methane 4,4 di 8 hydroxy ethyl urea diphenylmethane 4,4 di 4 hydroxy cyclohexyl urea oxalic acid di ss hydroxy ethyl amide 1,4 cyclohexane di hydroxy butyric acid amide terephthalic at di hydroxy propyl amide and hydrazo dicarboxylic acid hydrox propyl amide.Preference, however, is given to the use or high melting co poly esters or co polyester amides which are built ut of units from one or more dicarboxylic acids having a molecular weight not higher than 300, at least 70 mole of which consists of terephta acid, and of units derived from one or more low molecular weight diols having a molecular weight not higher than 250, at least 70 mole of which consists of 1,4 butane diol, and the sur of the terages of the dicarboxylic acid which is not terephthalic acid of the diol which is not 4,4 butane diol is not higher than 30.The group of diols having, molecular weight not higher than 250 which may be used besides. 4m4 butane diol the preparation of above mentioned copolyesters or copolyester arres molecule . cycloaliphatic and aromatic dihydroxy compounds.Preference is given to the use of diols having 2 15, and more particularly 5 10 carbon atoms, such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, isobutylene glycol, pentamethylene glycol, 2,2 dimethyitrimethylene glycol, hexamethylene glycol and decamethylene glycol, dihydroxy cyclohexane, dimethanol cyclohexane, resorcinol, hydroquinone and 1,5 dihydroxy naphthalene.Special preference is given to the use of aliphatic diols having 2 8 carbon atoms. The group of bisphenols that may be used includes bis p hydroxy biphenyl, bis p hydroxy phenyl methane and bis p hydroxy phenyl propane. The group of dicarboxylic acids having a molecular weight not higher than 300 which may be used besides terephthalic acid for the preparation of the above mentioned high melting bifunctional copolyesters or copolyester amides includes aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic dicarboxylic acids By the term aliphatic dicarboxylic acids used in the description cf the present invention is to be understood carboxylic acids having two carboxyl groups which are each linked to a saturated carbon atom.If the carbon atom to which the carboxyl group is linked is saturated and forms part of a ring, the acid is a cycloaliphatic acid. Aliphatic and cycloaliphatic acids containing a conjugated unsaturation soften cannot be used because of their tendency to homopolymerization. Particular unsaturated acids, however, such as maleic acids, are quite suitable to be used.The aromatic dicarboxylic acids according to the invention are dicarboxylic acids having two carboxyl groups which are linked to a carbon atom in a separate or a condensated benzene ring. It is not necessary for the two functional carboxyl groups to be linked te the same aromatic ring if more tan one ring is present, the rings mav be interlinked through aliphatic or aromatic divalent groups, cr divalen. grout such as O crAs representative examples or aliphatic and cycloaliphatic acids that may be used in the process according to the invention may be mentioned sebacic acid, Q clohexane 1,3 dicarboxylic acid, cyclohexane 1,4 dicarboxylic acid, adipic acid, glutaric acid, succinic acid, carbonic acid, oxalic acid, azelaic acid, diethyl malonic acid, allyl malonic acid, 4 cyclohexane 1,2 dicarboxylic acid, a ethyl suberic acid, a.a .B.8 .tetramethy1 succinic acid, cyclopentane dicarboxylic acid, decahydronaphthalene 1,5 dicarboxylic acid, bicyclohexyl 4, 4,4 dicarboxylic acid, decahydronaphthalene 2, 6 dicarboxylic acid, 4,4 methylene bis cyclohexyl carbonic acid , furan 3,4dicar boxylic acid and cyclobutane 1,1 dicarboxylic acid. Preferable aliphatic and cycloaliphatic acids are cyclohexane dicarboxylic acids and adipic acid.As representative examples of aromatic dicarboxylic acids may be mentioned phthalic acid and isophthalic acid, bibenzoic acid, substituted dicarboxy compounds having two benzene rings, such as bis p carboxyphenyl methane, p oxy p carboxyphenyl benzoic acid, ethylene bis p oxybenzoic acid , naphthalene 1 , 5 dicarboxylic acid, naphthalene 2,6 dicarboxylic acid, naphthalene 2,7 dicarboxylic acid, phenanthrene dicarboxylic acid, anthracene dicarboxylic acid, 4,4 sulphenyl dibenzoic acid and C1 Cl2 alkyl and ring substitution derivatives thereof, such as halogen derivatives, alkoxy derivatives and or aryl derivatives. Hydroxyl acids, such as p B hydroxyethoxy benzoic acid also may be used, provided that also an aromatic dicarboxylic acid is present.Aromatic dicarboxylic acids form a group which is preferred to be used in the preparation of the last mentioned bifunctional highmelting copolyesters or copolyester amides.Preferred aromatic acids are the acids having 8 16 carbon atoms, more particularly the phenylene dicarboxylic acids, i.e., phthalic acid and isophthalic acid.To obtain a satisfactory hardening rate it is essential that at least 70 mole of the dicarboxylic acid incorporated into the high melting copolyester or copolyester amides should consist of terephthalic acid, and at least about 70 mole of the low molecular weight diol incorporated into the high melting part of the polymer consist of 1,4 butane diol. A further requirement to be satisfied by the preferred compositic of the high melting copolyesters or copolyester amides is that the sum of the percentages of the dicarboxylic acid which is not tereok thalic acid and the other low molecular weight diol is not highe than 30. Should, for ir7tance, 30 of the low molecular weight dioj molecules used be substances other than 1,4 butane diol, then all the dicarboxylic acid used must be terephthalic acid, or should, say, 108 of the low molecular weight diol molecules used be substances other than 1,4 butane diol, then at least about 80 of the dicarboxylic acid used must be terephthalic acid.Copolyesters having fewer 1,4 butylene terephthalate units than is assured by the above conditions do not have sufficiently rapid hardening rates.Within the scope of the present invention it is preferred that use be made of high melting polyesters or polyester amides which are entirely or practically entirely built up of units derived from terephthalic acid and 1,4 butane diol.The resulting polyesters or polyester amides generally have an accurately predetermined molecular weight between 500 and 5000, and preferably between 1200 and 3000. The low melting polyesters or polyester amides can be obtained in a manner known in itself and similar to that used for the preparation of high melting polyesters or polyester amides, for instance by polycondensation of polyfunctional, and preferably bifunctional alcohols, amino alcohols, hydroxy carboxylic acids, lactones, aminocarboxylic acids, cyclic carbonates or polycarboxylic acids.Any desirable molecular weight and number and type of terminal groups may be obtained by an appropriate choice of the mixing ratio of the above mentioned components. A decrease in melting point of the lowmelting components can be obtained by reacting them with a less than stoichiometric amount of diisocyanate. Thus polyesters and diisocyanates, for instance toluene diisocyanate, used in a molar ratio of 2 1 to 3 2, can be converted into polyester urethanes having termi nai hydroxyl groups.As examples may be mentioned polyesters from adipic acid and ethylene glycol, butane diol, pentane diol, hexane diol, mixtures of ethylene glycol and propylene glycol, hexane diol and methylhexane diol, hexane diol and 2,2 dimethyl 1,3 propane diol, hexane diol, butane diol or pentane diol or polyester amides from hexane diol and piperazine. Also other glycols, such as 1,3 or 1,4 cyclohexane diol or 1,3 or 1,4 bishydroxy methylcyclohexane, amino alcohols such as amino ethanol or amino propanol may be incorporated into the lowmelting components. The low melting components may entirely or partly be composed of lactones, such as substituted or unsubstituted caprolactone or butyrolactone.Under some circumstances, for instance for the purpose of increasing the melt viscosity of the end product, it may be advisable to incorporate a small proportion of compounds of a higher functionality.As examples of such compounds may be mentioned trimethylol ethane, trimethylol propane or hexane triol. The low melting bifunctional components also may be derived from, for instance, the following acids glutaric acid, pimelic acid, suberic acid, isosebacic acid or ricinoleic acid. Into the low melting bifunctional compounds there also may be incorporated aliphatic dicarboxylic acids having heteroatoms, such as thiodipropionic acid.Further suitable acids are cycloaliphatic dicarboxylic acids, such as 1,3 or 1,4 cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid and terephthalic acid and isophthalic acid.To obtain a remarkably better resistance to hydrolysis it is preferred that use be made of polyesters made up of units each consisting of at least 5 carbon atoms. As examples thereof may be mentioned adipic acid and 2,2 dimethyl propane diol or mixtures of 1,6 hexane diol and 2,2 dimethyl propane diol or 2 methyl 1,6 hexane diol.Besides the low melting polyesters or polyester amides the segmented thermoplastic elastomers according to the invention may contain a limited proportion of other low melting bifunctional compounds.Examples thereof include polyalkylene glycol ethers having termira hydroxyl groups as obtained by reaction with water, diamines, dicr trifunctional alcohols or amino alcohols. Special mention is made here of polytetrahydrofuran, which is obtained by polymerization of tetrahydrofuran in the presence of acid catalysts or copolymers there of and small amounts of ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide.Preference is giyen to the exclusive use of polyesters and or polyester amides, because only then the essential advantages of the present invention, such as a very good resistance to UV light, become manifest. The use of a small proportion of, for instance, polyethylene oxide glycol may be of importance for improving the physical properties, such as swelling in oil.The molecular weight of the low melting bifunctional compounds is preferably in the range of about 700 to 3500. This molecular weight can be very much increased by the use of a less than stoichiometr z amount of diisocyanate, so that also from a compound having a moi cular weight in the range of 500 to 1000 an excellent elastomer can be obtained. It has been found that an elastomer having very good properties can be obtained if the low melting polyester has a molecular weight in the range of 800 to 2500, preference being given to the use of polybutylene adipate as low melting polyester.It has been found that under some circumstances the resistance to hydrolysis of the elastomers prepared by the present process is not quite satisfactory. According to the invention the solution ta this problem consists in that preferably into the ready product there is incorporated a stabilizing amount of polycarbodiimide. The amount of it to be incorporated is entirely in accordance with the description of the stabilization of polyethylene terephthalate in the NetherlandsPatent Application 6 907 958.Another useful solution to improving the resistance to hydrolysis is the introduction of high molecular weight silicon compounds having OH, NH2 and or COOR terminal groups in an amount of 0,5 to 5 per cent by weight, calculated on the elastomer. The diisocyanates, with the aid of which the high melting and the low melting segments of the thermoplastic elastomers according to the invention are interlinked may be represented by the general formula OCNRNCO, wherein R represents a divalent aliphatic, cycloaliphatic aromatic group. As examples of suitable diisocyanates of the aliphatic type may be mentioned hexamethylene diisocyanate dimethyl hexamethylene diisocyanate trimethyl hexamethylene diisocyanate metaxylylene diisocyanate paraxylylene diisocyanate tetramethylene diisocyanate. In the case where R represents an aromatic group it may be substituted for instance with a halogen, a lower alkyl or a lower alkoxy groupAs examples of these diisocyanates may be mentioned l chloro 2,4 phenylene diisocyanate 2, 4 toluene diisocyanate a mixture of 2,4 toluene and 2,6 toluene diisocyanate tetramethylphenylene diisocyanate diphenylmethane 4,4 diisocyanate metaphenylene diisocyanate paraphenylene diisocyanate 1,5 naphthalene diisocyanate biphenyl 4,4 diisocyanate Aiphenylmethane 4,4 diisocyanate 4,4 isopropylidene diphenylisocyanate benzophenon 4,4 diisocyanate diphenylether and diphenylsulphide diisocyanate 3,3 dimethyldiphenyl 4,4 diisocyanate 3,3 dimethoxydiphenyl 4,4 diisocyanate 3,3 dichlorodiphenyl 4,4 diisocyanate benzofuran 2,7 diisocyanate. Examples of diisocyanateshaving a cycloaliphatic group include isophoron diisocyanate, dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate and 1,4 cyclohexane diisocyanate.It has been found that in general optimum properties are obtained if the ratio between the number of NCO groups of the diisocyanate and the functional groups of both the low and the high nelting polyesters and or polyester amides is in the range of 1,1 to 1,3.Within the scope of the invention it is further preferred that use should be made of polyesters having hydroxyl end groups, both with a view to the properties of the end product and the ease of prepa ration.The thermoplastic elastomers obtained by the process of the present invention are excellently suitable to be injection moulded or extrudedOver the known commercial elastomers they have the great advantage of an exceptionally high resistance te oxidative degradation and Uvradiation.The invention will be further described in the following examples, which are of course only meant to illustrate the invention and do not limit the scope thereof.To determine the properties of the polymers prepared in these examples use was made of the following methods. P 1 relative viscosity measured on a solution of 1 gramme of 0 elastomer in 100 ml of m cresol at 25 using an Ubbelohde viscosimeter.A Du Pont Thermal Analyze s was used to determine Tg the temperature range within which the glass transition cf the soft segment takes place Ts the temperature range within which the hard segment melts Ts the temperature s at the melting peak s p The hardness Shore D was measured in accordance with DIN 53 505.The stress strain curves were measured on ISO II bars punched in conformity with DIN 53 504.On these the following quantities were measured S100 the stress value in N m2 at 1008 elongation BS the breaking load in N m BR the breaking elongation in .The tension set was determined after extension by 1008 in accordance with DIN 53 518.The compression set B 258 deformation was determined in accordance with DIN 53 517.The tear resistance Graves was measured in accordance with ASTMD 1004 Die C.Example IA mixture consisting of 0,37 moles of polybutylene adipate molecular weight 1070 1,44 moles of polybutylene adipate mol. weight 1750 and 4,00 moles of toluene diisocyanate was heated for 45 minutes at 850C.Besides, polybutylene terephthalate having a molecular weight of 2070 was prepared by transesterification of dimethyl terephthalate in the presence of an excess of 1,4 butane diol and 425 ppm of tetrabutyl titanate as catalyst.Part of the polybutylene terephthalate was heated for 30 minutes at 2450C in the presence of 1500 ppm of diethylcarbethoxy methyl phosphonate. Half of the prepolymer of polybutylene adipate and toluene diisocyanate was added, with vigorous stirring, to 0,91 moles of deactivated and an equal amount to non deactivated polybutylene terephthalate. In either case the polybutylene was in the molten phase at 2450C.Samples were taken after reaction times of 5, 20, 30, 60 and 90 minutes, respectively, and after immediate cooling the Tg, Ts and Ts p were measured.The results are given in the following table.

Example IIIIn this example it is shown that the hardness of the elastomers prepared by the present process, which hardness as is generally the case with block polymers is very much dependent on the weight percentage of hard segments, may be influenced by a great many parameters.First of all, mention is made here ot the molecular weight of the hard segments. An increase in the molecular weight thereof, with the other parameters being kept constant, is accompanied by an increase in the hardness of the elastomer.With a constant molecular weight cf the hard segments an increase in the molecular weight of the soft segments will result in a decrease of the hardness of the elastomer. With a constant molecular weight of both the hard and the soft segments the hardness of the elastomer may be affected by a change in the NCO OH ratio of the prepolymer.A decrease of the NCO OH ratio of the prepolymer corresponds to an increase in the proportion of soft segments and, consequently, leads to a decrease of the hardness of the elastomer.The compositions of a few elastomers prepared in a manner described in previous examples and their physical properties are given in the following table. The hard segment was deactivated dihydroxy polybutylene terephthalate having a molecular weight of 2400. The polymerization of the elastomer was conducted in an 0,5 1 autoclave for 30 minutes at 245 C, followed by 30 minutes deactivation with diethyl carbethoxymethyl phosphonate at 2450C.The diisocyanate used was toluene diisocyanate at an NCO OH ratio of 1,10 for the end product.

The NCO OH ratio in the end product was always 1,1.The melt viscosity was measured with a GÏttfert viscosimeter with a capillary 3,8 cm long and 0,1 cm in diameter. The shear rate was chosen in accordance with extrusion conditions used in actual practice, viz. at D 500 sec 1. The quantity is then defined as follows 4 V 1 3D T 3 sec. , where V the volume in cm per second which flows through the capillary r radius of the capillary cm .The measurements with the Gottfert Rheometer were carried out at a temperature in the range of 2050 to 2300C. Besides the melt viscosity the melt index was measured at a temperature of 220 C and a force of 21,5 N. The amount of polymer in grammes which flows through the capillary of the viscosimeter in 10 minutes was taken as a measure of the melt index1 the value of the melt index increasing with decreasing melt viscosity.The results are listed in Table IV.The hard segments were prepared from two batches of polybutylene terephthalate having a molecular weight of 2400 and 2640, reside tively.

The melt viscosity is also dependent on the NCO OH ratio of the final elastomer and the diisocyanate used. Thus, a polymer prepared from a mixture containing diphenyl methane 4,4 diisocyanate MDI will generally have a higher melt viscosity than a polymer prepared under the same conditions but from a mixture containing TDI.Example VIn this example a number of elastomers are compared which in spite of their difference in composition show a great resemblance as far as a number of their physical properties are concerned. In all cases the polybutylene terephalate used had a molecular weight of 2400 and was deactivated by heating at 245 C in the presence of such an amount of diethyl carbethoxymethyl phosphonate that the ratio P Ti was 12.The further preparation of the polymers was entirely in accordance with the procedure indicated in the Examples I and II, except that into the soft segment of polymer 3 some amount of TMP was still incorporated. The compositions and the measuring results are summarized in Table V. Example VIIn this example it is shown that when use is made of a diisocyanate having a relatively high vapour pressure, such as diphenylmethane 4,4 diisocvanate MDI , the process according to the invention can be carried out in one and the same reactor.Tne polybutylene terephthalate used had a molecular weight of 2500 and was deactivated by heating for 30 minutes with 3500 ppm diethylcarbethoxymethyl phosphonate at 2400C.Subesquently, there were added, with vigorous stirring and over a period of 20 minutes, 2,24 moles MDI per mole of polybutylene terephthalate, with the temperature being kept at 240 C.

Deactivation with the particular phosphorus compound was effected heating for 30 or 240 minutes at 2400C.
