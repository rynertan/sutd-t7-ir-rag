# Process for providing a uniform carbon distribution in ferrous compacts at high temperatures.

## Abstract
A process for high temperature sintering of ferrous powder metallurgy compacts having a substantially uniform carbon distribution which comprises a heating the ferrous powder metallurgy compact in the heating zone of a sintering furnace to a temperature of about 2,300 to 2,550 F 1,260 to 1,399 C , b introducing to the heating zone an atmosphere comprising about 2 to less than 10 volume percent hyd rogen, about 0.5 to 2.0 volume percent carbon monoxide, about 0.5 to 1.0 volume percent methane and the balance nitrogen, and c removing the sintered product from the furnace.
