# An oxygenator.

## Abstract
An oxygenator, such as an artificial lung, comprising a cylindrical housing 1 provided with inlet and outlet ports 8, 9 for oxygen, and a bundle of porous hollow fibers 5 disposed within the housing 1 . The porous hollow fiber 5 made of polyolefin resin having an inner diameter of from 100 to 300 µm, a wall thickness of from 10 to 50 µm, an average pore size of from 200 to 1,000 A and a porosity of from 20 to 80 . The blood is allowed to flow through the hollow fiber 5 , and O₂ CO₂ exchange is effected through the porous wall of the hollow fiber 5 .
