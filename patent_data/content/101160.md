# Reciprocating drive and reversing mechanism for long stroke, well pumping unit.

## Abstract
A yo yo variety reversing mechanism for long stroke, well pumping units, which employ a lift belt 22 as the operative link between a winding drum 16 and the polish rod of the well pump. Shock experienced between transfer from an upstroke to a downstroke is cushioned by a novel winding drum 16 for the lift belt 22 which decreases the effective radius of the drum 16 at the point of exchange from a downstroke to an upstroke to thus slow movement of the belt 22 and cushion the shock of exchange from a downstroke to an upstroke. The reversing mechanism or control may be arranged to provide a power source off dwell period during the aforesaid stroke exchange.
