## Description
The present invention relates to a process for producing L phenylalanine. More particularly, the present invention relates to a process for producing L phenylalanine which comprises culturing a microorganism belonging to the genus L phenylalanine is an amino acid which is useful as a raw material for a sweetening agent. It is an object or the present invention to provide an improved process for the production of this amino acid on an industrial scale at low cost. Heretofore, as the enzymatic processes for producing L phenylalanine using phenylpyruvic acid as a susbstrate, the processes which cause cells of microorganisms belonging to the species Although the processes exemplified above result in improved yields of L phenylalanine, the production yields of such processes, nevertheless, are comparatively low from a commercial application standpoint. Thus, a need exists for a process for producing L phenylalanine in higher yields at low cost. To this end, it has now been found that L phenylalanine is produced in higher yields by using the process of this invention. In accordance with the present invention, L phenylalanine is produced by culturing a microorganism belonging to the genus The microorganism utilized in the present invention is a microorganism belonging to the genus Examples of the preferred microorganism are As the medium in which the microorganisms as described above are cultured to produce L phenylalanine, either a natural medium or synthetic a medium may be employed so long as it contains carbon sources, nitrogen sources, inorganic salts, etc. As the carbon source, carbohydrates such as glucose, fructose, sucrose, maltose, mannose, starch, starch hydrolyzate, molasses and fruit juices, sugar alcohols such as glycerol, sorbitol and mannitol, organic acids such as acetic acid, formic acid, fumaric acid, malic acid, citric acid and gluconic acid, alcohols such as methanol, ethanol and propanol may be used. As the nitrogen source, ammonia or inorganic and organic ammonium salts such as ammonium chloride, ammonium sulfate, ammonium acetate and ammonium phosphate, nitrogen containing compounds such as urea, amines, peptone, meat extract, yeast extract, corn steep liquor, caseine hydrolyzate, soybean cake hydrolyzate, various fermented cells and digested products thereof may be used. As the inorganic material, potassium dihydrogen phosphate, dipotassium hydrogen phosphate, magnesium phosphate, magnesium sulfate, sodium chloride, ferrous sulfate, manganese sulfate and calcium carbonate may be used. When the microorganism to be used in the present invention requires specific nutrients for its growth, it is, of course, also necessary to add appropriate amounts of these substances to the medium. In some cases, such nutrients may be supplied by natural materials mentioned above as examples of the nitrogen source. Phenylpyruvic acid and the amino group donor are added to the aforementioned culture medium either from the beginning of culturing or during the course of the culturing. As the amino group donor, L glutamic acid, L aspartic acid, L leucine, L lysine, D or L methionine, glycine, L arginine, L ornithine and D or L alanine may be used. They are used in the form of final products manufactured by the fermentation method or chemical synthesis method, crude products obtained during the course of such manufacture, amino acid fermentation broths produced by the fermentation method and the enzyme method, and reaction solutions. Phenylpyruvic acid is used in the form of salts such as ammonium salt, sodium salt, potassium salt or calcium salt. Ammonium ion is supplied in the form of a salt such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium phosphate, ammonium nitrate, ammonium chloride, ammonium acetate, ammonium formate, ammonium fumarate, or ammonium malate, or in the form of ammonia water or ammonia gas. Culturing is carried out by aeration agitation at a pH of from 3 to 10, preferably 6 to 9, and at a temperature of from 20 to 60 C, preferably 25 to 40 C for 1 to 5 days. As the result, L phenylalanine is formed in the culture broth. The enzymatic process for producing L phenylalanine using cells of the microorganisms mentioned above or the product of treatment thereof is explained hereinafter. As regards the composition of the culture medium and the culture conditions in case of obtaining the cells of the miroorganism, the same composition and condition as described above are used. The microbial cells thus obtained are used without any further treatment for the reaction. Optionally the cells are subjected to various treatments and the products of such treatments may be used for the reaction. As the microbial cells, cells themselves or culture broth containing cells may be used. As the product of treatment of cells, the product of mechanical attrition of cells, the product of treatment with ultrasonic waves, the product of lyophilization, the product of treatment with solvent, the product of treatment with enzyme, the product of desiccation, the product of treatment with surfactant, the protein fraction of cells and the immobilization products of cells and products of cell treatment may be used. The reaction is effected by causing the cells obtained as described above or the product of their treatment to react upon phenylpyruvic acid and an amino group donor. As regards the amino group donor, the same donor as mentioned above may be used. For the purpose of the reaction, the concentration of phenylpyruvic acid is in the range of 0.01 to 1 M, and that of amino group donor in the range of 0.01 to 2 M. These raw materials are supplied all at once or intermittently. The reaction is carried out at a pH of from 4 to 10, preferably 6 to 9, and at a temperature of from 10 to 70 C, preferably 25 to 45 C, for 1 to 48 hours. As the result, L phenylalanine is formed in the aqueous solution. Recovering of L phenylalanine from the culture broth or the aqueous solution is effected by means of ion exchange resin or active carbon adsorption. Practice of specific embodiments of the invention is illustrated by the following representative examples. One loop of each of the microorganisms shown in Table 1 was inoculated into a test tube containing 10 ml of a culture medium pH 7.0 comprising 0.5 glucose, 0.3 yeast extract, 1 meat extract, 1 peptone and 0.3 sodium chloride. Culturing was carried out at 28 C for 18 hours, with shaking 210 rpm . After completion of the culturing, the test tube was centrifuged to collect cells, washed twice by centrifugation with 10 ml each of an aqueous 0.85 sodium chloride solution. Then, 1.5 ml of a reaction solution of the following composition was poured to the test tube and the reaction was carried out for 18 hours under the same conditions as described above. As the result, L phenylalanine was formed in a concentration shown in Table 1. The composition of the reaction solution is as follows 50 mM sodium β phenylpyruvate, 200 µM pyridoxal phosphate, 100 mM Tris buffer pH 7.4 , and 100 mM L sodium glutamate or 100 mM L sodium aspartate as an amino group donor. The same procedure as described in Example 1 was repeated except that microorganisms shown in Table 2 were used. The results are shown in Table 2. Culturing was carried out at 28 C for 5 hours with shaking 210 rpm . Then, 0.5 ml of an aqueous sodium phenylpyruvate solution in a concentration of 50 mg ml passed through a membrane filter for removal of microbial cells was added to the culture broth and culturing was continued for 24 hours in total. After completion of the culturing, 3.8 mg ml L phenylalanine was accumulated in the supernatant. As a control, when the same procedure was conducted in the absence of phenylpyruvic acid, not more than 0.1 mg ml L phenylalanine was accumulated in the supernatant.
