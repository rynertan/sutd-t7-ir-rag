# Electrodes for cardiac pacemakers.

## Abstract
A dual electrode for use in cardiac pacemaking to enable both ventricular and atrial electrical contact to be made. The electrode is formed as a catheter 4 for passing through a blood vessel to the heart and has a ventricular electrode at its distal end. Spaced back from the distal end are one or more atrial electrodes 2 in a plane transverse to the catheter and spaced radially apart therefrom. The or each atrial electrode is supported in a material 14 sufficiently flexible and resilient to enable the atrial electrode s to distort out of the plane and pass through the blood vessel. The atrial electrodes may be formed as separate prongs, or a single continuous electrode may be formed to resemble a small floppy disc . Means such as springs 12 may be provided to increase the resilience of the material 14 supporting the atrial electrodes 2 .
