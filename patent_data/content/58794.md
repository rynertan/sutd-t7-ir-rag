# Composition and method for treating an aqueous medium.

## Abstract
There ist disclosed a composition and a method for treating aqueous systems, e. g. for controlling the deposition of scale imparting precipitates on structural parts of a system exposed to an aqueous medium containing scale imparting precipitates, under scale imparting conditions, and for dispersing inorganic and organic matter, which may exist within a cooling system, boiler system, or the like. The composition comprises an acrylic acid lower alkyl hydroxyl ated acrylate copolymer I which is administered to the system in combination with an alkyl phenoxy polyethoxy ethanol compound II . The method comprises administer ing an effective amount of each of ingredients I and II to the aqueous system to be treated.
