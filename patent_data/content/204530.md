# Method for forming direct positive color image.

## Abstract
A method for forming a direct positive color image by subjecting an inner latent image type light sensitive silver halide color photographic material for formation of a direct positive color image, having at least one light sensitive emul sion layer containing inner latent image type silver halide grains which have not been previously fogged on the grain surfaces to color developing processing after image expo sure, which comprises developing an inner latent image type sensitive silver halide color photographic material for forma tion of a direct positive color image wherein a silver halide emulsion in at least one light sensitive emulsion layer con sists substantially of a silver chlorobromide emulsion with the use of a color developing solution containing an N hydroxyalkyl substituted p phenylendiamine derivative at 30 C or higher for not longer than 150 seconds. In accordance with the present invention, there can be provided a rapid and stable method of processing an inner latent image type light sensitive material for formation of direct positive image by use of a color developer containing the color developing agent of the present invention, which can maintain constantly adequate photographic performance over a long term without suffering from influence by the change in the bromide ion concentration even when proces sed with reduced supplemental amount and is also little in generation of developing fog.
