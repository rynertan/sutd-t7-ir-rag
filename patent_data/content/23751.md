# Process for producing five, six or seven membered saturated nitrogen containing heterocyclic compounds.

## Abstract
Five, six and seven member nitrogen containing sat urated heterocyclic compounds are prepared by the cataly tic hydrogenation cyclization of beta, gamma and delta cyanoesters, in the presence of catalysts containing ruthe nium and or iron which give the desired product in high yield and with high selectivity. The conversion of methyl 3 cyano propionate to pyrrolidone and methyl 5 cyanopro pionate to caprolactam are particularly described.
