# Semiconductor memory device.

## Abstract
A semiconductor memory device operated synchro nously with clock signals, such as a MOS dynamic RAM device. The semiconductor memory device includes a switch circuit 7 inserted between a prestage output amplifier circuit 5a receiving a readout signal OUT from a memory cell, and an output buffer circuit 6 . The switch circuit is turned on just before the output signal OUT is supplied from the prestage output amplifier circuit to the output buffer circuit and turned off after the output condition OUT of the output buffer circuit is settled. The potential corresponding to the output data is maintained in the circuit between the switch circuit and the output buffer circuit. The output condition of the output buffer circuit is therefore retained even during the reset period of the prestage drive circuit, and the duration period of the output signal OUT is expanded.
