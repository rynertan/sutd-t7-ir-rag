# AN ADAPTER, PARTICULARLY INTENDED FOR AN ELECTRICAL CONTACT RAIL

## Abstract
The invention relates to an adapter 10 for cooperation with a substantially C shaped contact rail, collector rail, wiring channel or like device 126 having flange like portions facing towards a longitudinally extending opening, these flange like portions carrying on their inner surfaces electrical conductors 158, 159, 160 . The adapter includes an elongated insertion part 22 and a contact and locking beam having electrical con tact pins 42, 44 and being arranged to be swung between a position in which it lies in the insertion part for insertion of the adapter 10 into the contact rail 126 or removal of the adap ter therefrom, and an extended position in which it is firmly se cured against the flange like parts of the contact rail. The con tact beam is secured to a hollow shaft 52 which extends through a guide sleeve 84 on the adapter 10 . The shaft 52 and the guide sleeve 84 include manoeuvering grooves 66 and guide grooves 88 respectively, for receiving a mounting tool 100 , by means of which the adapter can be fitted to and removed from the contact rail 126 . The connector includes a push cover 20 for the guide sleeve 84 , this cover activating a switch in a manner to break the supply of current when the opening of the guide sleeve 84 is accessible to the mounting tool 100 . The adapter is provided on the front side 12 thereof with a signal lamp 18 , which lights up when the adap ter 10 is connected to a current carrying conductor.
