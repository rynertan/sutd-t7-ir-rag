# A METHOD FOR THE PREPARATION OF BENZENE AND METHYL SUBSTITUTED BENZENE DERIVATIVES

## Abstract
The invention provides an improvement in the yield of benzene and methyl substituted benzene derivatives such as toluene, xylene and trimethylbenzenes by the catalytic hydrogenation treatment of heavy aromatic hydrocarbon compounds having 9 or more carbon atoms in a molecule. The improvement comprises the use of a specific solid catalyst which is a crystalline aluminosilicate supporting a metallic element selected from the metallic elements be longing to the VIIIth Group of the Periodic Table including nickel, platinum, palladium, rhodium and iridium introduced into the carrier by the ion exchange treatment. The hy drogenation treatment of the heavy aromatic hydrocarbon compound is effective to selectively dealkylating the alkyl groups other than methyl.
