# BATTERY CHARGING APPARATUS AND METHODS

## Abstract
An apparatus and method for recharging a battery in one vehicle from the electrical system of another vehicle, and for determining when that battery has been sufficiently recharged. In one aspect of the invention there is provided circuit means, adapted to be respectively coupled to both the battery and the electrical system of the two vehicles. The circuit means include an array of light emitting diodes, the number and sequence of illumination of the diodes in the array being indicative of the extent to which the battery has been recharged.
