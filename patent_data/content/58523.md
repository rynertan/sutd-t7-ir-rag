# Foldable and portable bicycle with compact steering bearing.

## Abstract
A foldable, portable bicycle in which the handlebar assembly, the seat assembly, the pedal crank and the frame are foldable quickly and easily into a compact and regular shaped package that is easily portable and storable, and are unfoldable with similar speed and ease into a safe, durable and comfortable bicycle that accommodates adults of nor mal size. The frame is designed with a low profile that is substantially the same in height and thickness as the dimensions of the wheels and their supports, and the handlebar and seat assemblies extend upwardly to normal height, but fold and collapse, along with the pedals, to substantially within the confines outlined by the folded frame. The steering bearing is housed in a front wheel mount in the form of a narrow arcuate band on the front end of the frame, and has a height that is substantially less than its diameter, about one quarter the diameter as disclosed. The bearing has at least one set of rolling bearing elements that are confined, both laterally and vertically, in races that are defined between the band and bearing rings on the handle bar assembly and the front wheel support, these being connected through the front wheel support by connecting means that draw them together and against the opposite ends of the bearing. In one embodiment, two series of ball bearings are closely spaced, vertically, on opposite V grooved sides of an internal flange on the band, and held in the grooves by oppositely opening V grooves in bearing rings above and below the flange. In another, a single set of ball bearings is confined in an inwardly opening V groove in the band by beveled edges of two bearing rings cooperating to form an outwardly opening internal V groove for the balls. In each case, the increased lateral separation of the balls compen sates for the reduced axial length to enable the vertically compact bearing to sustain the torque and thrust loads encountered in use.
