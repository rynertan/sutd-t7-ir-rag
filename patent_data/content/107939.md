The invention will now be more particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings which show, by way of example only, a preferred embodiment of the invention. In the drawings Figure 1 is a side elevation of a display device according to the invention Figure 2 is a part front elevation of the display device Figure 3 is a typical side elevational sectional view of the display device Figure 4 is a cross section of an extrusion used to form framing members for the display device Figure 5 is a plan view of a back panel or housing for the display device Figure 6 is a sectional view taken along AA ofFigure 5 and Figure 7 is a section view taken along BB ofFigure 5. Referring to the drawings, the display device comprises a plane mirror 120 and a sheet of reflective glass 130 held in spaced apart relationship at their edges by four framing members 140. Each framing member 140 is mitred at each end so that the framing members may be joined to form a rectangular frame 150 for the display device. Positioned behind the mirror 120 is a back panel or housing 160 which contains a fluorescent lighting unit 170 and a transformer 171 for operating the lighting unit. The housing 160 is supported by the framing members 140. The display device. is also provided with a stand 180 which is supported by the lower framing member 140a. Referring to Figures 3 and 4, the framing members 140 are each formed from an elongate extrusion of high impact polyvinyl chloride PVC . Integrally formed in the extrusion are U shaped channels 142 and 143 which support respectively the sheet of reflective glass 130 and the mirror 120. Provided at the mouths of the Ushaped channels 142 and 143 are pairs of off set gripping lips 144. Extending between the U shaped channels 142 and 143 is a wall 145 which is provided with a plurality of grooves so as to provide a nonreflective surface between the mirror 120 and the sheet of reflective glass 130. The use of a black pigment in the PVC extrusion assists in making the wall 145 a nonreflecting surface.Also integrally formed on the extrusion as an element of each framing member 140 is a support channel 147 having an L shaped lip 148 which is adapted to engage and disengage with leg 182 of the stand 180. The other face of the wall 145 together with two overhanging ridged grips 149 forms a slot 152 which is used in constructing the frame 150. Spaced from the slot 152 is a housing attachment channel 155 which is defined by a flange 156 having an inwardly facing verge 157, and a strut 158. Figures 2 and 3 illustrate how the frame 150 is constructed from the framing members 140. A leg 165a of an aluminium angle corner piece 165 is inserted into the slot 152 at each mitred end of the lower framing member 140a. A light shim is attached to the inside of each leg of the corner pieces 165 using a double sided adhesive pad to ensure that the corner pieces are held in position by friction the pads or shims are not shown in the drawings . A slot 152 of a framing member 140 is placed over the upstanding leg 165b of each corner piece 165 and pushed into engagement to form a U shaped receiver. The mirror 120 and the sheet of reflective glass 130 are then positioned in the U shaped channels 142 and 143 of the three framing members 140 of the Ushaped receiver. The frame is then completed using a fourth framing member 140 and two further corner pieces 165. The constructional details of the housing 160 are shown in Figures 5 to 7. The housing 160 as shown in plan view is generally rectangular in shape. The back wall 200 of the housing 160 is provided with a keyhole slot 210 to enable the display device to be mounted on a wall by a screw or the like not shown . The edge portion 220 of the housing is sloped at an angle for insertion into and co operation with the attachment channels 155. When the edge portion 220 is underneath the flange 156 and pressing down on the strut 158, a self tapping screw 225 is screwed into the edge portion 220 from the flange 156 so as to secure the housing in. position in the frame. A total of four screws 225 are used to secure the housing 160. A number of single sided adhesive sponge pads 230 are attached to the framing members 140 at the area of contact between the frame 150 and the main body of the housing 160 to assist in securing the back panel in position. The lighting unit 170 is attached to the back wall 200 of the housing 160 by double sided adhesive pads 235 and the transformer 171 is attached to the housing by plastic pop rivets 240. The inner surface of the housing 160 is white so as to reflect the light from the fluorescent lighting unit 170 on to the rear of the mirror 120 which is chemically etched to define a display or the outline of a display. The outer surface of the housing 160 is dark coloured so as to provide a non reflecting surface for stray light. To provide for the two different coloured surfaces, the housing 160 is vacuum formed from a laminate plastics material. A light diffuser sheet 167 is secured to the rear of the reflecting surface of the etched mirror 120. The light diffuser sheet 167 is a sheet of translucent material e.g. flexible P.V.C. which is placed in front of the lighting unit 170 to achieve even distribution of light and to bear screen printing of matter to be displayed. The lighting unit 170 projects the display through the etched mirror 120 onto the sheet of reflective glass 130 which reflects the display back to the mirror 120 which in turn reflects the display back to the sheet of reflective glass and so on, thus achieving a multiple reflection of the display. Such a multiple reflection is known as Wan infinity effect .The multiple reflection of the display is only achieved when the light to the rear of the sheet of reflective glass 130 i.e. lighting unit 170 is more intense than the light to the front of the sheet of reflective glass 130. The display device may be used as a point of sale advertising device or a decorative device and may be used for example, in hotels, lounges, clubs or homes. The production of an illuminated display by the method just described is technically limited by the screen printing process used to reproduce the display material matter on the light diffuser sheet. A significantly better effect can be achieved by using a transparency 166 in place of all or a part of the screen printing. A display device for advertising a product such as a liqueur would ideally contain 1 a mirror 120 etched to define the outline of the matter to be displayed, 2 a light diffuser sheet 167 screen printed to provide a proportion e.g. lettering of the display and c a photographically produced colour transparency 166 of a bottle of liqueur. The transparency 166 is secured to the rear of the mirror 120 between the latter and the diffuser shee 167. The screen printed display produces a bold clear display of the printed matter and the transparency 166 produces a detailed image of the bottle of almost three dimensional clarity. The above display arrangements can also be used with other display devices such as, for example, illuminated clocks. The method of producing display images described is particularly suited for point of sale advertising devices, but has numerous other applications.
