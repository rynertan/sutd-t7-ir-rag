# Piston assembly for a refrigerant compressor.

## Abstract
A piston assembly for a reciprocating piston type compressor is desclosed. A piston 27 slidably disposed within aluminum alloy cylinder 12 has two annular grooves 27a,b at its outer peripheral surface to place the upper and lower position thereof. A conical shaped piston ring 35 which is formed of resin is disposed in each grooves with a gap. The outer diameter of piston ring 35 is larger than the outer diameter of piston 27 , in the normal temperature to prevent the direct contact with piston 27 and cylinder 12 is secured without abnormal wearing and maintained the effective flow of the lubricating oil from the cylindrical chamber to crank chamber.
