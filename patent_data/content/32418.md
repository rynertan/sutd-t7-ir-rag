# Method and means for releasably rigidly fastening together beams and like profiles.

## Abstract
A method and means for releasably and rigidly fastening together flanged metal profiles 1, 2 such as H beams is described for use when the profiles cross at an angle and lie one on the other with flanges in contact. There are provided four clamps 8 , one to fit each angle formed by the crossing profiles. Each clamp 8 has sides which meet at an angle corresponding to that which the clamp is to fit so that the sides abut the contacting flanges 3.4 . The sides have fea tures 6 to embrace edge portions of the flanges 3,4 and protrude above the lower flange 4 and below the upper flange 3 . The protruding portions of the sides of the clamps 8 are connected by bolts 9 which pass outside the profiles 1,2 so holding the profiles together without the need for providing bolt holes in them.

## Description
METHOD AND MEANS FOR RELEASABLY RIGIDLY FASTENINGTOGETHER BEAMS AND LIKE PROFILES. The present invention relates to a method and means for releasably rigidly fastening together beams and like flanged metal profiles lying across one another at an angle with flanges in contact, and is particularly useful when the flanged metal profiles, e. . H beams, lie across one another substantially at right angles. For instance, when a bridge is to be erected, a temporary bridge may first be erected as scaffolding, and later disassembled and removed after completion of the permanent bridge. The general practice in building a bridge has been that flanged profiles such as H beans are rigidly fastened together where they cross by bolting thus necessitating forming bolt holes in the profiles, or by rivetting or welding them together with or without doubling plates between them. If such a procedure is adopted when erecting a temporary structure such as a temporary bridge, disadvantages or difficulties arise.For instance assembly takes a long time, disassembly is arduous and the profiles themselves are damaged so restricting their repeated use. The present invention aims at avoiding these difficulties when flanged profiles such as H beams are to be releasably rigidly fastened together. According to the present invention, a method for releasably and rigidly fastening together flanged metal profiles, for example H beams, lying across one another at an angle, preferably substantially at right angles, comprises the steps of applying at each angle formed by the profiles where they cross a substantially L shaped clamping member having sides which meet at an angle such that the sides abut against the flanges of the lower and upper profiles respectively, the side abutting the lower profile having a portion protruding above the contacting flange of that profile and the side abutting the upper profile having a portion protruding below the contacting flange of that profile, the sides of the clamping member also embracing the contacting flanges of the profiles, and applying fastening means releasably rigidly connecting together said protruding portions of the sides of the clamping members which confront each other and are spaced by the profiles. According to the invention, moreover, there is provided for use in the above method for rigidly connecting the profiles together means comprising a set of clamping members, one to fit each angle formed by the crossed profiles each clamping member having sides which meet at an angle corresponding to the angle to be fitted by the member whereby the sides lie against respective ones of the contacting flanges the sides having features embracing the contacting flanges and the sides projecting beyond the flanges clear of the profiles and fastening means joining the clamping members to hold them rigidly on and thereby join the profiles, the fastening means passing below the upper profile and over the lower profile as the case may be. According to a feature of the invention edge embracing features are provided by slots in a plurality of ribs integral with and projecting from the sides parallel to one another. The following is a detailed description of the presently preferred, illustrative embodiment according to the present invention, which embodiment is shown in the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is an exploded perspective view of portions of two metal H beams as examples of the standardized flanged metal profiles lying across one another substantially at right angles in an overlapping relationship and the means according to the present invention for securing the profiles together prior to being secured in position, and Fig. 2 is a perspective view whowing the H beams rigidly fastened together. Referring now to the drawings, it is assumed that two standardized metal profiles, e.g. standard H beams 1 and 2, lie across one another at an angle e.g. right angles, with their upper and lower flanges 4 and 3 respectively contacting one another and they are intended to be releasably but rigidly fastened together. For this purpose, as a rule Ã…a set of four clamps 8 are provided to be applied in respective angles formed by the intersection of H beams 1 and 2. Each of clamps 8 comprises a main body which has a generally L shaped configuration in plan view so as to have two vertical sides meeting substantially at right angles, the angles respectively conforming to the angles made between H beams 1 and 2.Each cramp has a number of ribs, e.g. two or three vertical ribs 6 as shown, integral witheachside and protruding at right angles from the outside faces of the sides. The ribs 6 are preferably provided at each end, and, if necessary, additionally at the middle of the respective sides. Further, the ribs 6 are formed with cutouts or grooves 5 formed orthogonally to their surfaces such that cutouts 5 can snugly receive the edge portions of lower flange 3 and upper flange 4 of intersected H beams 2 and 1, respectively, when the clamps are in position. As will be seen, the clamps 8 are rigidly secured to the profiles by fastening means consisting of nuts and bolts 9 which pass through one or more holes 7 in each of the portions of the sides of the clamps 8 protruding below the flange 3 of profile 2 and above flange 4 of profile 1 so that no holes need be produced in the profiles themselves. In other words the bolts 9 securing clamps 8 to profile 1 pass over the top of the flange 4 and those securing clamps 8 to the profile 2 pass under the flange 3. In the illustrated case, because of the disposition of flanges 4 and 3 and thus of the bolt holes in the clamps 8, four different clamps 8 are used each corresponding to one particular angle. However if desired, the clamps 8 for diagonally opposite angles may be the same. Thus, it will be appreciated that when theH beams 1, 2 are to be releasably rigidly fastened together, firstly an appropriate clamp 8 is fitted in each angle formed by intersection of the H beams 1, 2, the cut outs 5 being forced on to edge portions of the flanges 4, 3 by a blow to the clamp body, and then the respective confronting sides of clamps 8 projecting beyond flanges 3 and 4 are respectively fastened together by the nuts and bolts. The number and dimensions of the ribs 6 and bolts 9 can be suitably selected depending upon the required strength of the temporary bridge or other structure. Although the fastening means according to the present invention has been described and shown as being utilized to fasten together H beams, it will be appreciated that it may be utilized equally for fastening other standardized metal profiles so long as they have plate like edge portions extending lengthwise similarly to the flanges of the H beams. From the foregoing it will be understood that by practising the present invention two crossing standardized metal profiles can be rigidly fastened together without the need for drilling bolt holes, or effecting a welding operation, etc. which have hitherto been absolutely necessary, and at the same time the disassembly and withdrawal of the metal profiles is made easy, causing no damage thereto, so their repeated use is possible. A latitude of modification, change and substitution is intended in the foregoing disclosure and in some instances, some features of the invention will be employed without a corresponding use of the other features. Accordingly, it is appropriate that the appended claims be construed broadly and in a manner consistent with the spirit and scope of the invention herein.
