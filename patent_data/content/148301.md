Even on dry out the 1,2,3,3,5,6 hexamethyl bicyclo 2.2.2 oct 5 en 2 ol has excellent, aesthetically pleasing, strong, camphoraceous, patchouli notes. In comparison to the products disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,967,629, 3,914,932 and 3,929,676, the 1,2,3,3,5,6 hexamethyl bicyclo 2.2.2 oct 5 en 2 ol of our invention has a much more intense 3X longer lasting 4X than the nearest specifically stated compound or isomer of the aforementioned patents. In any event, the disclosures of the aforementioned patents, 3,929,676, 3,914,932 and 3,967,629 are incorporated herein by reference. The 1,2,3,3,5,6 hexamethyl bicyclo 2.2.2 oct 5 en 2 ol of our invention can be prepared in two ways. The first manner of preparing the 1,2,3,3,5,6 hexamethyl bicyclo 2.2.21 oct 5 en 2 ol of our invention is disclosed in the aforementioned patents incorporated by reference herein and involves the reaction of dimethyl acetylene having the structure EMI26.1 with the compound having the structure EMI26.2 according to the reaction EMI26.3 The resulting compound having the saructure EMI26.4 is then hydrogenated according to the reaction EMI27.1 to form the compound having the structure EMI27.2 This compound is then reacted with an organometallic compound having the structure EMI27.3 in order to form 9 mixture of isomers defined according to the structures EMI27.4 wherein M represents MgX or Li and X represents chloro, bromo or iodo. This reaction is schematically illustrated as follows EMI28.1 The resulting organometallic compounds defined according to the structures EMI28.2 are then treated with weak acid in order to form the mixture of isomers of our invention having the structures EMI29.1 The 1,2,3,3,5,6 hexamethyl bicyclo 2.2.2 oct 5 en 2 ol of our invention can be prepared according to the novel process of our invention which gives rise to higher conversions and higher yields and is, in general, a more efficient process than the above mentioned process of the prior art.The novel process of our invention involves firstly, the reaction of the compound having the structure EMI29.2 with the compound having the structure EMI29.3 in accordance with the reaction EMI30.1 The g compound defined according to the structure EMI30.2 is a novel compound.This compound may be hydrogenated stepwise to first form the compound having the structure EMI31.1 which is then further hydrogenated catalytically to form the ketone defined according to the structure EMI31.2 In the alternative, the compound having the structure EMI31.3 may be hydrogenated with three moles of hydrogen in one step going through the intermediate. EMI32.1 which is not isolated to yield the compound having the structure EMI32.2 Thereafter, the compound having the structure EMI32.3 is treated with the compound EMI33.1 in the same manner as set forth supra to ultimately yield the isomers of our invention having the structures EMI33.2 The reaction of the compound having the structure EMI33.3 with the compound having the structure EMI33.4 may be carried out in the presence or in the absence of a reaction vehicle. Such a vehicle can function as a solvent for the reactions, to moderate the course of the reaction, to provide more intimate contact between the reactants and to improve control over parameters such as temperature and pressure. The reaction vehicle should be inert and is desirably one in which both reactants are soluble. The reaction vehicle in this reaction may be an aromatic hydrocarbon such as benzene or a substituted aromatic hydrocarbon particularly an alkyl substituted benzene such as toluene, xylene or the like The pressure under which the Diels Alder reaction between the compound having the structure EMI34.1 and the compound having the structure EMI34.2 is carried out can vary over a range and is desirably superatmospheric.Pressures of from 150 to 400 psig are desirably used. The e Diels Alder reaction can be carried out at temperatures of from about 1500C up to about 300 C. Below the aforesaid lower temperature, the reaction proceeds at a very low rate. On the other hand, at temperatures considerably higher than those preferred, the reaction may proceed uncontrollably and or produce a relatively large quantity of unwanted by products which lower the yield of desirable materials and complicate purification of the product. The preferred temperature of the instant reacticn between the compound having the structure EMI35.1 and the compound having the structure EMI35.2 is between 1900C and 210 C. The resultant reaction product having the structure EMI35.3 can be purified and or isolated by conventional methods as hereinafter mentioned. The stepwise hydrogenation of the compound having the structure EMI36.1 to form the intermediate having the structure EMI36.2 is carried out with gaseous hydrogen. The hydrogenation is desirably carried out at superatmospheric pressures of 150 600 psig and preferably from 200 to 400 psig to provide a good reaction rate without substantial production of unwanted by products. The temperature is chosen so as to provide reaction times of about 1 to 8 hours and preferably 2 to 6 hours. Accordinqly, the temperatures utilized are in the range of 20 400C, preferably from 25 3O0C. The hydrogenation is desirably carried out in the presence of an inert vehicle, desirably a lower aliphatic alcohol.Preferred vehicles are ethanol, propanol and isopropanol.The reaction is carried out in the presence of a catalyst and the metallic hydrogenation catalyst such as nickel or precious metals such as platinum or palladium. The metallic catalyst can be utilized on a carrier and a 5 palladium on carbon catalyst is utilized in certain preferred embodiments of our invention. The intermediate having the structure EMI37.1 can be purified or isolated by conventional purification after appropriate washing, neutralizing or drying. The intermediate having the structure EMI38.1 is further hydrogenated to form the ketone having the structure EMI38.2 by means of additional hydrogenation at higher temperatures,The hydrogenation is carried out with gaseous hydrogen and is desirably carried out at superatmospheric pressures of from 150 600 psig and preferably from 200 400 psig to provide a good reaction rate without substantial production of unwanted by products, The temperature is chosen so as to provide reaction times of ahout 1 to 8 hours and preferably 2 to 6 hours. Accordingly, the temperatures utilized are in the range of 7 C to 2100C and preferably 750C to 1200C. The hydrogenation is desirably carried out in the presence of an inert vehicle desirably a lower aliphatic alcohol. Preferred vehicles are ethanol, propanol and isopropanol. The reaction is carried out in the presence of a catalyst and the metallic hydrogenation catalyst such as nickel or precious metals such as platinum or palladium are desirable. The metallic catalyst can be utilized on a carrier and a 5 palladium on carbon catalyst is utilized in certain preferred embodiments of our invention. To obtain the 1,2,3,3,5,6 hexamethyl bicyclof2.2.2 oct 5 en 2 ol according to our invention, the ketone defined according to the structure EMI39.1 is reacted with an organometallic compound having the structure EMI39.2 wherein M may be MgX or Li.and X is chloro, bromo or iodo. Examples of compounds wherein M is MgX are methyl magnesium chloride, methyl magnesium bromide and methyl magnesium iodide.Examples where M is Li i.methyl Lithium. The reaction is preferably carried out in a vehicle.The vehicles are polar organic solvents and solvents having a boiling point at atmospheric pressure in the range of 130 14O0C are preferred. The preferred solvent is xylene. Surprisingly, using a xylene solvent at a temperature in the range of 135 1400C at atmospheric pressure, an optimal ratio of isomers is obtained yielding optimal organoleptic aroma properties particularly concerning the aesthetic value of the long lastinq intense, Patchouti aroma quality of the isomer mixture. The reaction vehicle can also comprise phosphorous containinq materials such as hexamethyl phosphoramide and the like, The reaction vehicle as noted above can also include aromatic solvents, particularly monocyclic materials such as benzene, toluene and the like. The reaction with the organometallic compound is desirably carried out at temperatures of from lO0C to about 2Bu C. The use of temperatures substantially below this desirable range results in extremely low reaction rates and the use of temperatures substantially above this range can result in undesirable by products and unnecessarily high pressures. It is, accordingly, preferred to use temperatures in the range of from SOOC to 150 C and preferably from 130 140 C. The reaction can be carried out under a wide range of pressures depending on temperature and vehicles used but the atmospheric and superatmospheric pressures are preferred The quantity of compound having the structure EMI40.1 reacted with compound having the structure EMI40.2 can be varied over a wide range. It is desirable to use at least a stoichiometric quantity of organometallic compound, and quantities up to 250 of such theoretical amount can be utilized, that is, a 150 excess. In general, it is desirable to use from about 125 to about 200 of the theoretical amount of organometallic compound to insure good reaction rates and completeness. The time required for the reaction will vary depend in a upon the temperature, pressure and the like. Ordinarily, reaction times of from about 2 to about 24 hours are desirable.It will be understood from the present disclosure, that temperatures of 100 C will permit obtaining good yields of organo metalloid corresponding to the alcohol in our hours with relatively small excesses of organometallic compounds whereas longer times of 16 to 20 hours can be required with temperatures of 600C. These organo metalloids are defined according to the structures EMI41.1 wherein M is defined as above. After the reaction with the organometallic compound is completed to the extent desired, the product is then hydrolyzed by acidification or basification to obtain the alcohols themselves having the structures EMI41.2 A base or an acid can be added to water and this can be used to wash and hydrolyze the salt, the product of the reaction. Such hydrolysis can b carried out over a wide range of temperatures from SOC to about 10Q C and temperatures of 150C to about 300C are preferred. In certain embodiments of the invention, the hydrolysis is carried out with an acidic medium such as saturated harmonium chloride solution. As taught hereinafter, the isomers and mixtures of isomers of the present invention, the 1,2,3,3,5 ,6 hexamethyl bicyclo 2.2.2joct 5 en 2 ol of the present invention, has certain strong, patchouli, ginger and camphoraceous aroma nuances which suit them for altering the aroma of consumable materials such as perfume compositions, colognes and perfumed articles, e.g. solid or liquid anionic, cationic, nonionic or witterionic detergents or fabric softener compositions or fabric softener articles, e.g. BOUNCE0Dtaanufactured by theProcter Gamble Company of Cincinnati, Ohio. According to our invention, a perfume composition is composed of a small but effective amount o f 1,2,3,3,5,6 hexamethyl bicyclo 2.2.2 oct 5 en 2 ol produced according td this invention and an auxilliary perfume ingredient includina, for example, alcohols other than the 1,2,3,3,5,6 hexamethyl bicyclot 2.2.2 oct 5 en 2 ol isomers of our invention, aldehydes, ketones, nitriles, esters and frequently,hydrocarbons which are admixed so that the combined odors of the individual components produce a pleasant or desired fragrance.Such perfume compositions usually contain a the main note or bouquet or foundation stone of the composition b modifiers which round off and accompany the main notes c fixatives which include odorous substances which lend a particular note to the perfume throughout all stages of evaporation and substances which retard evaporation and d topnotes which are usually low boiling, fresh smelling materials. In perfume compositions, the individual component will contribute its particular olfactory characteristics but the overall effect of the perfume composition will be the sum of the effect of each ingredient. Thus, the l,2,3,3,5,E. hexamethyl bicyclot 2.2.2 oct 5 en 2 oI of this invention taken as individual isomers having the structures EMI43.1 or mixtures of these isomers in various proportions can be used to alter the aroma characteristics of a perfume composition, for example, by highliqhting or moderating the olfactory reaction contributed by another ingredient in the composition. The amount of the l,2,3,3,5,6 hexamethyl bicyclo 2.2.2 oct 5 en 2 ol of our invention either in admixture or as individual isomers which will be effective in perfume compositions depends on many factors including the other ingredients, their amounts and the effects which are desired.It has been found that perfume compositions containing as little as 0.02 of the 1,2,3,3,5,6 hexamthyl bicyclo12,2,2 oct 5 en 2 ol of our invention, or even less, can be used to impart a scent odor to soaps, cosmetics, solid or liquid anionic, cationic, nonionic or zwitterionic detergents, perfumed polymers, fabric softener compositions and drieradded fabric softener articles such as BOUNCE and other products. The amount employed can range up to 5 or higher of the fragrance components and will depend on considerations of cost, nature of the end product, the effect desired on the finished product and the narticular fragrance sought. The 1,2,3,3,5 ,6 hexamethyl bicyclo 2.2.2joct 5 en 2 ol of our invention either taken as isomeric mixtures or considered as individual isomers having the structures EMI44.1 can be used alone or in a perfume composition as an olfactory composition for augmenting, enhancing or modifying the aromas of solid or liquid anionic, cationic, nonionic or zwitterionic detergents and soaps space odorants and deodorants perfumes colognes toilet waters bath preparations such as bath oils and bath salts hairpreparations such as lacquers, brilliantines, pomades and shampoos cosmetic preparations such as creams, deodorants, hand lotions and sun screens powders such as talcs, dusting powders, face powders and the like.When used as an olfactory component of a perfumed article, as little as 50 ppm of the 1,2,3,3,5,6 hexamethyl bicyclo 2.2.2oct 5 en 2 ol of our invention will suffice to impart a strong, camphoraceous, patchouli and ginger aroma character. Generally, no more than 5 of the perfumed article is required. Thus the range of 1,2 ,3,3,5,6 hexamethyl bicyclo 2.2.2Joct 5 en 2 ol in a.perfumed article varies from 50 ppm up to 5 bv weight. All parts, percentages, proportions and ratios herein giver are by weight unless otherwise indicated. In addition, the perfume composition or fragrance composition can contain a vehicle or carrier for the 1,2,3,3,5,6 hexamethyl bicyclof2.2.20oct 5 en 2 ol alone or taken together with other ingredients. The vehicle can be a liquid such as an alcohol, a glycol or the like. Examples of glycols are propylene glycol. Examples of alcohols are non toxic alcohols such as ethyl alcohol. The carrier can be an absorbent solid such as a gun or components for encapsulating the composition such as ty coacervation using gelatin or such as by forming a polymer wall around a liquid center as by using a urea formaldehyde prepolymer. The following examples are given to illustrate embodiments of the invention as it is presently preferred to practice it.It will be understood that these examples are illustrative and the invention is not to be considered as restricted thereto except as indicated in the appended claims.

EXAMPLE XVIII Scented polyethylene pellets having a pronounced patchouli, aroma with camphoraceous and ginger nuances are prepared as follows In accordance with Example III of U.S. Patent 3,505,432, the specification for which is ìncorporatedby reference herein, 75 pounds of polyethylene having a melting point of about 2200F are heated to about 2300F in a container of the kind illustrated in Figures 1 and 2 of U.S.Patent 3,505,432 25 pounds of the l,2,3,3,5,6 hexamethyl bicyclot2.2.2joct 5 en 2 ol prepared according to Example XVI, bulked fractions 6 and 7 are then quickly added to the liquified polyethylene, the lid is put in place and the agitating means are actuated.The temperature is maintained at about 2250F and the mixing is continued for about 5 15 minutes. The valve at the bottom of the container is then opened to allow flow of the molten polyethylene enriched with the tricyclic alcoholcontaining material to exit through the orifices at the bottom of the holding tank. The liquid falling through the orifices solidifies almost instantaneously upon impact with the moving, cooled conveyor. Solid polyethylene beads or pellets having a pronounced patchouli aroma with ginger and camphoraceous undertones are thus formed. Analysis demonstrates that the pellets contain about 25 of the 1,2,3,3,5,6 hexamethyl bicyclof2.2.2joct 5 en 2 ol so that almost no losses of the scenting substance occur. These pellets may be called master pellets. 50 pounds of the patchouli scentcontaining master pellets are then added to 1,000 pounds of unscented polyethylene powder and the mass is heated to the liquid state. The liquid is molded into thin sheets of films.The thin sheets of films have a pronounced patchouli aroma with ginger camphoraceous undertones. EXAMPLE XIX 100 pounds of polypropylene are heated to about 3000F.30 pounds of the perfume composition described in ExampleXVII are added to the liquified polypropylene. This procedure is carried out in the apparatus shown in Figures 1 and 2 of U.S. Patent 3,505,432. After mixing for about 8 minutes, the valve at the bottom of the container is opened to allow the exit of the polypropylene scented material mixture whereby solid pellets having a pronounced honey patchouli aroma are formed on the conveyor belt.The pellets thus obtained are then admixed with about 20 times their weight of unscented polypropylene and the mixture is heated and molded into flat discs. The flat discs have a strong and pleasant honey patchouli aroma.
