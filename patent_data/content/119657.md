## Abstract
Method for the storage on and the reproduction from an optically readable record carrier, record carrier for use in the method and apparatus for use in the method. A method is described for storing and reproducing data words by means of a standard compact disk digital audio player. The bit groups in which said data words are con tained are recorded at least three times, the analog output signal of the player being sampled and digitized during re production.
