# Regulated power supply circuits.

## Abstract
This regulated ac dc power supply circuit comprises a power supply transformer 10 having two sets of secondary windings 20, 21 52, 54 and a compensating transformer 40 having axciting windings 42, 44 and two compensating windings 22, 24 . The compensating windings 22, 24 are connected individually in series circuit with the principal power supply secondary windings 20, 21 to which a full wave rectifier circuit 26, 28 and an electric load 36 are connected. The exciting windings of the compensating supply transformer 40 have ac potential applied thereto from the other secondary windings 52, 54 on the power transformer 10 which also supply dc power by means of another full wave rectifier circuit 46, 48 for compensating control circuitry 60 which has an input circuit connected across the load to sense potential variations thereat and an output for varying the ac supply to the exciting windings inversely of variations in load potential. A differential amplifying circuit 64 is used for determining the load potential variation. The error signal produced at the output of the differential amplifier circuit is applied to a transistor 62 effectively to insert a dc component in inverse feedback relationship into the exciting windings 42, 44 of the compensating transformer 40 . As the output potential of the power supply increases, the input potential to the rectifier assembly 46, 48 is decreased, and the converse. The direct current flow path is completed through the load whereby little or no energy is dissipated elsewhere.
