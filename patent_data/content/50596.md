## Description
Procedure for transforminz electrical energy to antimatter with positron storageAngelo TORRE, Via 0. Salomone,5 Manfredonia FG IThis invention involves a new procedure for transforming electrical energy to anti matter with positron storage, so as to facilitate storage and transport. There is currently no method involving transformation to antimatter among the known procedures for energy storage.The aim of the present invention is to achieve a high yield in the storage of differentiated quantities of already produced electrical energy.This aim is achieved with a procedure for transforming the energy into anti matter, in particular into antielectrons or positrons, using the physical phenomenon of cascade showers , curr ently verified with could chambers.This phenomenon consists of the fact that, sdhenever a charged particle for example an electron or positron passes through several horizontal lead plates in succession, it may undergo a very slight deflection in the field of one of atoms in the plates. Said deflection consists of an accelerated motion, and so electromagnetic radiation is emitted in the form of a gamma ray.This is the physical. phenomenon of braking radiation or bremsstrahlun, . Of course, the particle may be deflected by several atoms in a single plate, in which case several gamma quanta will be emitted. The gamma rays produced in this way may create electronpositron pairs in the fields of the atoms encountered when they pass through the plates. This is the physical phenomenon of pairs production.These charged particles in turn give rise to other gamma rays when they are deflected in the plates, and the new gamma rays generate new pairs, and so on.One individual electron can produce a cascade of gamma rays, electrons and positrons.The charged particles leave visible tracks in the could chamber, while the gamma rays are photographically invisible.Naturally, a cascade shower is stopped when the initial electron energy is distributed among such a large number of electrons, positrons and photons that none of them has sufficient energy to create supplementa v pairs. The low energy particles ate then absorbed by the lead plates.The energy of the electron which initiates the shower determines the number of secondary charged particles produced.The procedure according to this invention consists of the production of a beam of charged particles electrons with a suitable accelerator and the direction of this beam on the surface of the first of a series of several lead, tantalum or other metal plates. In said series arrangement, there is an ultra high vacuum between the plates,which are brought to extremely low temperatures. The positrors produced between the plates are then separated from the electrons with suitable magnetic fields and carried to suitable magnetic containers with magnetic guides, using mirror, toroidal or other valid type of magnetic field.With regard to the storage of said positrons, a recent literature report from C.E.R.N. June l979 described the development of a magnetic container for anti protons.Analogous technology, with suitable modifications, may be applied to the storage of positrons, thus preventin their annihilation with ordinary matter.Energetic electrons from the accelerator produce in the above mentioned arrangement a auantity of positrons approximately eaual to that of the electrons. The number of positrons and electrons produced with this method is proportional to the energy of the energetic electrons and to the intensity of the accelerator beam. The electrons produced and present between the metal plates are carried away with magnetic guides to be used as a source beam for the electron accelerator used in the procedure.One exemplifying but non limiting variant of the invention may be described as follow. Electrical energy generated by a power plant but not used by the consumer is used as a source for suitable electron accelerator. The charged energy beam is transformed to positrons using the above procedure, and the positrons stored in a suitable fashion form the energy reservoir of tbe plants At he .. amaze tA .Qe 2 .itt produced are used as a source for the accelerator.Thus, when stored energysust be drawn, the energy of the 0.5 Nev gamma auanta produced by annihilation of the positron electron pairs is converted to electrical energy to be placed in the electrical distribution network. The advantages offered by this system seem evident considering that 0.5 grams of positrons annihilating the 20 same quantity of electrons release 1.0x0 ergs of energy, that is, an amount equal to that from the combustion of more than 200 metrics tons of gasoline.The invention involves a completely new system for energy transport the energy produced at the power plant may be stored as positrons, and these, in suitable magnetic containers, may be transported to the areas where they will be used.Obviously, the mass and the dimensions of the positrons transported are practically infinitesimal, while that of the energy transported is extremely high. For example, nuclear power plant which adopt this pro cedure for transforming energy produced into positrons suitably contained in their magnetic containers5 could be constructed in areas of extremely low population density.The containers would then be transported from the power plant to large cities or industries where the positrons in them would be transformed in a suitable non polluting installation into electrical and or thermal energy. Analogously, even for other energy sources like oil, coal, solar energy, or any other type, transport from the production sites to the use areas is more economical, less polluting and easier when the energy is transformed into anti matter as in this invention directly at the source. This then involves only modest costs and encumbrances in distibuting the positron containers.In one application variant, the present invention allows the realization of energetiaally autonomous ground, marittime and air transport means with negligible fuel weights involved The only weight of the propulsion systems is that of the motor and the positron container, naturally considering that the electricity for magnetic field of the magnetic bottle containing the positrons can be supplied by suitable batteries, based on the energy autonomy of the vehicle in question as well as the particular type of positron motor. Also, said electrical battery must be charged using the energy produced by the annihilation of the positrons in the magnetic bottle, wSth a suitable inst.allation foe transformation into electrical energy. Another important application of the present invention.is that of the annihilation of suitable quantities of positron f roduced in the cascade sowers into initiate nuclear fusion reactions.This may be achieved with two processes, one indirect and one direct.With the indirect method, once the desired quantity of positrons is produced and stored in suitable magnetic containers, according to the invention, this quantity is taken from the positron container and annihilated with the nuclear fuel to supply energy to it. The annihilation power must be arbitrarily controlled, that is, the number of positrons annihilated in an unit of time. In this case, the magnetic containers for the positrons must be developed.In inertial confin ement, with the direct method, a special paste is prepared so that the energetic electrons of the accelerator beam, passing through a layer of a suitable metal, generate positron electron pairs which, with suitable technology, are used to induce the fusion of the nuclear fuel, suitably contained in the special paste.With the indirect method and inertial confinement, the positrons are taken from the positron container. power of annihilation, which depends on the rythm of positron production of the accelerator metal layer system.In the direct method, however, this limitation does not exist, because of the possibility of positron storage.Thus the above procedure allows for a new method for initiating nuclear fusion reactions.Moreover, one can imagine, through the use of a desired quantity of positrons, initiating nuclear fusion reactions which require a higher initiating temperature than the fusion reactions currently under study.Thermal energy may be produced fromthe positrons as follows.Positrons taken from their magnetic containers are, in arbitrarily controlled quantities and with suitable technology, directed against a special metal structure. In this way the positrons annihilate with the electrons of the metal, which in turn is heated by the resulting annihilation radiation. This thermal energy produced, spread to other bodies, may be used in technologies requiring such energy5 such as industrial, metallurgical and chemical processes as well as domestic or industrial space heating.This thermal energy produced by the positrons may also be converted to mechanical energy through heat engines may be used to produce, with suitable technology, positron beams of arbitrarily controlled power which, under vacuum for example, above the earth s atmospher could be used for various operations like metal working and nuclear transmutations.Moreover, suitable technology could be used to produce radiation consisting of 0.511 Mev by annihilating electrons with positrons, the latter being drawn from their magnetic bottles.The above radiation beams may be used to initiate controlled nuclear fusion reactions of the nuclear fuel both in magnetic confinement and inertial.With suitable technology, these radiation beams are used to heat the magnetically confined nuclear fuel or to induce nuclear fusion of the fuel confined in special pastes. The above radiation finds other applications in metal working, in nuclear transmutations and as a useful source of very hard x rays. The positrons drawn from their magnetic containers may also be used to produce lasers, through suitable technology. Posi tron source lasers are easilv transportable together TTith the magnetic containers with their rich energy content. Another application of the invention is that of using the charged particles of cosmic and solar radiations for the direct production of positrons, through an artificial satellite, designed for this end and places in orbit where the charged particles are denser.
