## Description
I a TUBULAR LOCE Most tubular locks in the market ate easy to pick because ofr The known tubular lock as shown in Fig. 10 and Fig.11 comprises a housing 1 in which a plurality of upper pintumblers Cs a bolt B, an upper plug D, a plurality of springsG, and a lower plug s are mounted. Each upper pin tumbler C has a length different from the others the same is tru to the lower pin tumblers H. The upper pin tumblers C are inserted into upper pin holes D of the upper plug A which is fixed to the bolt a. The lower pin tumblers II together with the springs G are inserted into lower pin holes F of the lower plug E. The number of the upper pin tumblers C is equal to the number of the lower pin tumblers H and is also equal to the number of the springs G. The bolt B extends through the upper plug A, the lower plug E, a blocking plate K and is screwed into a nut T.Each lover pin tumbler H is aligned with each upper pin tumblerC and extends from the lower plug 3 into each upper pin hole D.The combination of the upper plug A, the bolt B and the lower plug 3 are installed into the housing 1 and fixed by means of a pin Y inserted into the lower plug E. The pin tumblers are spring loaded so that they are always in the locking position except when the proper key is inserted0 As shown in Fig. 12, a correct key J is inserted into the known lock to lower the upper pin tumblers C which in turn press down the lower pin tumblers H to the correct height so as to enable the upper plug A to turn, thus allowing the upper plug A to revolve and release the bolt 3. Fig. 14, Fig. 15 and Fig. 16 and 17 illustrate the use of the pick tools first, insert each pin R of the pick as shown in Fig. 17 into each upper pin hole D to lower the upper pin tumblers C, which in turn push the lower pin tumblers H to the bottom of the lower pin holes D. Then, turn the pick tool clockwise and counterclockwise alternately, thereby slightly rotating the upper plug A clockwise and counterclockwise alternately. The reason why the upper plugA can slightly be rotated clockwise and counterclockwise is that the diameter of the upper pin tumbler C must be smaller than that of the upper pin hole D.Since the lower pin tumblers H are spring loaded, they will go upwards until their tops are in contact with the bottom surface of the upper plug A white the upper plug A is slightly rotated clockwise and counterclockwise, i.e. the lower pin tumblers II are lifted to the correct height. Thus the upper plug A is allowed to revolve and the bolt B is released. Fig. 18, illustrates the use of the pick tool shown in Fig. 9 to pick the known lock. First, slightly insert the pick tool shown in Fig. 9 into the upper plug A, and at the same time turn it clockwise and counterclockwise alternately. Thus the upper plug A is rotated clockwise and counterclociwise alternately. In consequence, the lower pin tumblers II will go downward until their tops are in contact with the bottom surface of the upper plug A while the upper plug A is being slightly rotated clockwise and counterclockwise, i.e. the lower pin tumblers H are lowered to the correct height. Thus the upper plug A is allowed to revolve and the bolt B is released. As stated, the known tubular lock is easy to pick and should be improved. The present invention relates to a tubular lock, and more particularly to one comprising a number of lower pintumblers having flanges in association with the same number of lower pin holes provided with recesses, making the lock very difficult to pick and offering a high degree of security under ordinary circumstances. The object of the present invention is to provide an improved tubular lock which is difficult to pick and to offer a high degree of security under ordinary circumstances.

Referring to Fig. I and Fig. 2, there is shown the present invention comprising a housing 200 in which a plurality of upper pin tumblers 3. A bolt 20, an upper plug 2, a plurality of lower pin tumblers 1, a plurality of springs 6, and a lower plug 4 are mounted. Each upper pin tumbler 3 has length different from the others, and the same is true to the lower pin tumblers. The upper pin tumblers 3 are inserted into upper pin holes 21 of the upper plug 2. The upper plug 2 is fixed to the bolt 20. Each lower pin tumbler 1 is provided with two flanges 11. The lower pin tumblers 1 together with the springs 6 are inserted into lower pin holes 41 of the lower plug 4. The number of the upper pin tumblers 3 is equai to the number of the lower pin tumbler 8 1 and is also equal to the number of the springs 6.The bolt 20 extends through the upper plug 2, the lower plug 4, a blocking plate 50 and a locking plate 60, and is screwed into a nut 70. Each lower pin tumbler 1 is aligned with each upper pin tumbler 3 and extends from tile lower plug 4 into each upper pin hole 21. The combination of the upper plug 2, the bolt 2, and the lower plug 4 are installed into the housing 200 and fixed by means of inserting a pin 80 into the lower plug 4. The pin tumblers are spring loaded so that they are always in the locking position except when the proper key is inserted. Referring to Fig. 3, there is shown a recess 411 at the upper part of each pin hole 41 of the lower plug 4.The depth of each recess 411 is different from the others. Referring to Fig. 4, there is shown a proper key 5 being inserted into the lock according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention to lower the upper pin tumblers 3 which in turu press down the lower pin tumblers 1 to the correct height so as to allow the upper plug 2 to revolve and release the bolt 20. Referring to Fig. 6, there i8 shown the height of the flange 11 being A, then the depth of the recess 411 is A 0.it, and the length of the upper end 12 is 2A let the depth of the lower pin hole 41 be B, then the diameter of the recess 411 is 1.2B. Fig. 7 shows why it is impossible to use the pick tool shown in Fig. 17 to pick the lock according to the present invention0 Each pin R of the pic tool shown in Fig. 17 is inserted into each upper pin hole 21 to lower the upper pin tumblers 3 which in turn push the lower pin tumblers 41 to the bottom of the lower pin holes 41. Then, turn the pick tool clockwise and counterclockwise alternately, thereby slightly rotating the upper plug 2 clockwise and counterclockwise alternately. The reason why the upper plug 2 can slightly be rotated cloci wise and counterclockwise is that the diameter of the upper pin tumbler 3 must be smaller than that of the upper pin hole 21. Since the lower pin tumblers 4 are spring loaded, they will go upwards until the flanges 11 are in contact with the bottom surface 22 of the upper plug 2 while the upper plug 2 is being slightly rotated clockwise and counterclockwise. is a result, the upper ends 12 of the lower pin tumblers 1 will go into the pin holes 21 of the upper plug 2. In other words, the rotation of the upper plug 2 is prevented by the lower pin tumblers 1, i.e. it is impossible to pick the lock accord ing to the present invention. Fig. 8 shows why it is impossible to use another pick tool shown in Fig. 9 to pick the lock according to the present invention. The pick tool shown in Fig. 9 is first slightly inserted into the upper plug 2, and at the same time is turned clockwise and counterclockwise alternately. Thus the upper plug 2 is slightly rotated clockwise and counter clockwise alternately. In consequence, the lower pin tumblers 1 will go downward until the flange 11 of the lower pin tumbler is in contact with the recess 411. In zither words, the rota tion of the upper plug 2 is prevented by the upper ends 12 of the lower pin tumblers 1, i.e. it is impossible to pick the lock according to the present invention. Nevertheless, once the flange 11 at the upper part of the lower pin tumbler 1 goes into the lower pin hole 41.The upper pin tumblers 1 will go into the recess 411 Xo, so tbat tbe rotation of the upper plug 2 is prevented by the upper pin tumblers 1. Consequently. it is impossible to pick the lock according to the present invention no matter what kind of picking method is used. In order to increase the safety of the present invention, the height of each flange 11 may be different one another and the same is true to the recesses. The invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the sp rit or essential characteristics thereof. The present embodiment is therefore considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive, the scope of the invention is indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description, and all changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalent of the claims are therefore deemed to be embraced therein.
