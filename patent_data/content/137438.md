# Method for passing a token in a local area network.

## Abstract
The right of access to the common communication medium of an initialized local area network is transferred between modules having access to the medium by the module having such access transmitting a token to a designated existing and properly functioning module. Each such module is assigned a unique address, its MY ADDRESS, and has the data processing capabilities to determine and store the address of the module to which it last successfully tranferred a token, its LAST SUCCESS ADDRESS. Each module also determines the address of a module, if any, between its LAST SUCCESS ADDRESS and its MY ADDRESS, its TRY ADDRESS. The module which has accepted a token will try to pass a token to the module whose address is that of its TRY ADDRESS if its TRY ADDRESS differs from its LAST SUCCESS ADDRESS before attempting to pass a token to the module whose address is that of its LAST SUCCESS ADDRESS. Each module calculates a diffe rent TRY ADDRESS if the difference between its MY ADDRESS and its LAST SUCCESS ADDRESS is greater than one each time it successfully passes a token to another module.
