## Description
This invention relates to the properation of aminosplphonle acids and their derivatives. According to the invention, there is provided a method fer the prearation of a compound of the formula EMI1.1 comprising neseting a nitrethiol fo the formula EMI1.2 with an active hydrogen compound of the formula HY wherein Y represents the residue of the active hydrogen compound after removal cl an active hydrogen atom, X together with the carbon atoms to which it is attached, signifies a carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring system and n is an integer of fro O to 3. The active hydrogen compound HY is a compound having an easily replaceable hydrogen atom. Thus, it is a typical nucleophilic reagent and examples of such compounds include water, the product then being a sulphonic acid an alcohol or phenol, the product then being a sulphonic acid ester an aliphatic or aromatic thiol, the product then being a thioester, a primary or secondary amine, the product then being a aulphenie acid anide a hydrogen halide, the product then being a sulphonic acid halide or an active methylene compound, tile product them being a sulphene. Preferably, the compound MY is a compound in which U represents a radical of the formula CH, ORÚ or NRêR wherein R. represents an optionally substituted hydrocarbon radical and each of R and R represents hydrogen or an optionally substituted hydrocarbon radical. The reaction proceeds particularly smoothly when X is an aryl radical such as phengl and them R2 is hydrogen or alkyl and R3 is an alkyl, cycloalkyl or aryl radical. rihe nitrethiol used as starting meterial may be a or heterocyclic carbocyclic compound and ray be of aromatic or non aromatic character. Examples of heterocyclic compounds include those in which the Ch2 N SH and NO2 groups are attached to a 5 or 6 membered saturated or unsaturated ring containing one or two hetero atoms, for exemple nitrogen, oxygen or sulphur. Particularly important carbocyclic nitrothiols are those of the benzene series. Other substituents may be present in the rings of either the carbocyclic or heterocyclic compounds in addition to the CH2 n SH and NO2 groups. the method of the invention is particularly useful for the preparation of aniline 2 sulphonie acid orthanilic acid and the asides and esters thereof and their ring substituted analogues from 2 nitrothiophenol and its ring substituted analogues. Examples of substituents which may be present in the benzene ring include halogen atoms, for example chlorine, and lower alkyl, lower allcox, nitro, acyl and trifluoromethyl groups. Other usuful sterting materiale include nitrethiols of the pyridine sorice and 2 nitrophenylmethanethiol. The reaction between the nitrothiol and the compound HY is conveniently carriet out by heating the two compounds together in appropriate amounts, woing a mutual solvent if Mecessary. Examples of solvents which may be used inelude lower alkanale, tetrahydrofuran, dioxan ans ethyl acetate. The reaction procedes smopthly at the atmospherie reflux temperatures of the bove sentioned solvents but lower temperatures may be used if desired.The yield of product may be inereaned by including an acid, for example aulphuric or hydrochloric acid, in the reaction mixturn. After completion of the reaction, the product may be isolated from the solvent by filtration in a very pure form. The products are useful as chemical intermediates, partisularly as dyestuff intermediates, copecially diazo components for use in the manufacture of azo dyes. The invention is illustrated but not limited by the following Examples in which all parts and percentages are by weight.
