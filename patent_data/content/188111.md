# Data stream synchronisers.

## Abstract
A synchronizer is provided for converting a first data stream provided at a first predetermined data rate to a second data stream provided at a second predetermined data rate, the synchronizer comprising elastic buffer means for receiving the first data stream and for providing the second data stream, and means for controlling the elastic buffer including means for synchronizing the control of the elastic buffer with the first and second data rates so as to avoid the occurrence and propagation of metastable logic states.
