# A.C. electricity power supply system and methods of and apparatus for load control thereon.

## Abstract
For safeguarding an alternating current electrical power supply system against a blackout due to overloading, particularly on a system which is not strongly intercon nected, each consumer 20, 21, 22 is provided with means sensing when the supply frequency falls below a predeter mined frequency, these means controlling switching devices 36 for interrupting the power to at least part of the load taken by each consumer. The sensing means conveniently comprises a control unit 50 responsive to the loss in phase lock of an oscillator 40 locked to the incoming supply frequency and forming for example part of an energy metering device. Provision is made for automatic restoration of the supply to loads when the frequency increases to another predetermined value.
