# A monopolar electrochemical cell, cell unit, and process for conducting electrolysis in a monopolar cell series.

## Abstract
The invention is a monopolar electrochemical cell series of the type having two end cell units and at least one intermediate cell unit positioned between said end units, said intermediate cell unit comprising a pair of planar electrode components spaced from each other and means to distribute electrical energy to each of said electrode components, said distributing means comprising an electrically conductive, substantially rigid, planar electric current transmission element 17 disposed in the space between said spaced electrode components, said transmission element being electrically and mecha nically connected to each of said electrode components at a plurality of points spaced over the entire surface of each of said electrode components wherein the said transmission element has a plurality of substantially solid bosses 18 distributed over both of its surfaces and projecting a predetermined distance outwardly from the transmission element into an electrolyte chamber adjacent to the transmission element, said bosses being capable of being mechanically and electrically connected either directly or indirectly to the electrode component 36, 36A and electrical connection means 21 attached to said transmission element for conducting an electrical current into or out of said transmission element.
