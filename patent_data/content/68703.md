# Cooling fan ducting.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a vehicle having a liquid cooled engine 20 transversely mounted for rocking motion relative to the vehicle frame 42 an engine cooling radiator 22 mounted forwardly of the engine and substantially parallel to the rotation axis of the engine crankshaft a cross flow fan 24 having a rotational axis substantially parallel to the crankshaft axis and disposed between the crankshaft axis and the plane of the radiator the fan is engine driven by a belt 36 , and a viscous coup ling to vary the fan speed in response to engine cooling requirements. In one embodiment the engine moves relative to the fan and the radiator. In this embodiment an air inlet duct assembly 40 is defined by a portion of the engine and members extending from the radiator to the engine. In the other embodiment the fan is fixed for movement with the engine and an air inlet duct assembly allows movement between the fan and the radiator.
