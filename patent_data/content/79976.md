# Solar heat collector.

## Abstract
A solar heat collector, in which an absorber plate 2 is located in a box member provided at one surface thereof with a transparent sheet 4 , being of such an arrangement that the absorber plate 2 has been subjected at the surface thereof to a selective absorption surface treatment and a transparent heat trap 7A formed of a fluoroplastics film and having a height 1 of about 1 2 of the interval L across the transparent sheet 4 and the absorber plate 2 is disposed between the transparent sheet and the absorber plate in contact with the transparent sheet. With this arrangement, the heat losses caused by convection, radiation and conduc tion can be suppressed at the same time.
