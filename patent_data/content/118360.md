# Boat type rocker arm assembly.

## Abstract
A low friction, boat type rocker arm assembly is pro vided. The boat type rocker arm is designed to roll on a fulcrum of a supporting pedestal during operation, rather than slipping or sliding thereon. The rocker arm has a recessed intermediate area of predetermined radius which is greater than the radius of the pedestal. The rocker has a rectangular opening 32 in the recessed portion with opposite, transverse edges 36 tapering downwardly and inwardly which fit closely with the pedestal 14 to limit travel of the rocker arm relative to the pedestal. The pedestal also has rounded surfaces at those portions positioned near the tapered edges of the rocker arm opening.
