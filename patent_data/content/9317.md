# Microprocessor tone synthesizer with reduced quantization error.

## Abstract
The accuracy of a required tone set, digitally syn thesized by a microprocessor 12 , is improved beyond the theoretical limit of the microprocessor circuitry by producing each tone at a frequency which is a sub multiple of the desired frequency, then multiplying to provide the desired frequency. With the addition of a multiplier 18 such as a doubler, a better choice of os cillator frequency becomes possible which further in creases the tone frequency accuracy. The microprocessor can also reduce the start up time and the time between tones, eliminating delays in transmitting a series of coded tones.
