## Description
L Isoleucine is an important component for parenteral and enteral nutrition and complex amino acid preparations. The present invention involves an improvement to a process for producing L isoleucine by fermentation. It is known that in order to impart L isoleucine productivity to microorganisms belonging to the genus From the viewpoint of industrial production, it is of importance to improve the fermentation yield or accumulation of L isoleucine. The present invention has been made to solve the foregoing problem. As a result of investigations on α hitherto known microorganism belonging to the genus That is, the present invention relates to a process for producing L isoleucine, which comprises culturing a microorganism belonging to a species selected from the group consisting of Examples of ML s of the present invention include methyllysines such γ ML, β ML, δ ML, ε ML, etc. Bacteria having resistance thereto are effective for improving L isoleucine productivity. The microorganisms used in the present invention are mutants which belong to the genus To obtain the mutants of the present invention, wild strains described below may first have imparted thereto L isoleucine productivity and then have imparted thereto ML resistance or α KM resistance alternatively, ML resistance or α KM resistance may be first imparted to the wild strains followed by having L isoleucine productivity imparted thereto. Examples of the wild strains that are parent strains of the mutants are known as To obtain the mutants of the present invention from these parent strains, a conventional process for mutation and induction, such as by treating the parent strains with N methyl N nitro N nitrosoguanidine, etc. is applicable. Separation of the mutants of the present invention from the bacteria solution obtained by mutation treatment may be carried out by collecting strains that grow on a medium containing ML or α KM. The relationship between a specific process for mutation of the mutants of the present invention and the degree of growth of strains in the presence of γ ML or α KM is shown below. From the bacteria that grew in agar medium containing γ ML, Further, from the strains that grew in agar medium containing α KM, The strain FERM P was originally deposited on January 8, 1974 and the strains FERM P 7674, FERM P 7675, FERM P 7676, FERM P 7677 and FERM P 7678 were deposited on June 22, 1984 at the Fermentation Research Institute, Agency of Industrial Sciences and Technology, Ministry of International Trade and Industry FRI , 1 3, Migashi 1 chome, Yatabe machi, Tsukuba gun, Ibaragi ken 305, Japan. These deposited strains were then converted into deposits under the Budapest Treaty on April 10, 1985, and were accorded the corresponding FERM BP numbers. The degree of γ ML resistance or the degree of α KM resistance of the thus obtained variants was compared with that of the parent strains. The bacteria obtained by culturing in a natural medium 1 g dl peptone, 1 g dl yeast extract, 0.5 g dl NaCl, pH 7.0 slant for 24 hours were suspended in sterilized water. The suspension was inoculated on a medium containing 0.5 g dl glucose, 0.2 g dl urea, 0.15 g dl ammonium sulfate, 0.3 g dl KH₂PO₄, 0.1 g dl K₂HPO₄, 0.01 g dl MgSO₄ 7H₂O, 0.1 mg dl CaCl₂ 2H₂O, 100 µg l biotin, 100 µg l thiamine hydrochloride, 0.002 g dl FeSO₄ 7H₂O, and γ ML or α ML in the amount shown in Table 2, the pH of which was adjusted to 7.0. After culturing for 24 hours, the degree of growth was determined by turbidity. In most cases, the yield can be further improved by additionally imparting to the aforesaid mutants a property that is already known to improve the productivity of L isoleucine, such as O methylthreonine resistance, β hydroxyisoleucine resistance or trichloroalanine resistance. The medium used for culturing such mutants is a conventional one containing carbon sources, nitrogen sources, inorganic ions, substances for satisfying the above mentioned auxotrophy, and if necessary, vitamins and other organic trace nutrients. As carbon sources, carbohydrates such as glucose, sucrose, etc., organic acids such as acetic acid, etc. are preferred and as nitrogen sources, ammonia water, ammonia gas, ammonium salts, etc. are preferred. If necessary, potassium ions, sodium ions, magnesium ions, phosphate ions and others are appropriately added to the medium as inorganic ions. It is preferred that the cultivation be conducted under aerobic conditions. When the cultivation is carried out while adjusting the pH of the medium to 4 to 8 and the temperature to 25 to 37 C during the cultivation, more preferred results are obtained. Cultivation for 1 to 7 days under these conditions produces and accumulates marked amounts of L isoleucine. L isoleucine may be collected from the culture solution in a conventional manner such as using ion exchange resins, etc. The invention now being generally described, the same will be better understood by reference to the following examples which are included herein for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to be limiting of the invention or any embodiment thereof, unless specified. A medium containing 10 g dl glucose, 7 g dl NH₄ ₂SO₄, 0.1 g dl KH₂PO₄, 0.04 g dl MgSO₄ 7H₂O, 1 mg dl FeSO₄ 7H₂O, 1 mg dl MnSO₄ 4H₂O, CaCl₂ 2H₂O, 100 µg l thiamine hydrochloride, 100 µg l biotin, 60 mg dl as the total nitrogen soybean protein acid hydrolysate solution and 5 g dl calcium carbonate separately sterilized was adjusted to a pH of 7.0, 20 ml of which was charged in a 500 ml volume flask followed by thermal sterilization. A platinum loop of the strain shown in Table 1 was inoculated on the medium. While being maintained at 31 C, the system was shaken for 4 days. In the culture solution of each strain, L isoleucine was accumulated in the amount shown in Table 3. AJ 12149 was cultured in a similar manner to obtain 1 liter of the culture solution. From the culture solution, the bacteria were removed by centrifugation and the supernatant was passed through a strongly acidic ion exchange resin Diaion SK 1B NH 4 type . After rinsing the resin with water, elution was conducted with ammonia water. Then the eluate was concentrated and from the concentrate, 17.0 g of crude L isoleucine crystals were obtained.
