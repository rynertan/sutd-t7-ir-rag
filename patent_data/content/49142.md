# Improved opening roller for open end spinning machines.

## Abstract
A pinned opening roller for an open and spinning machine wherein the pinning pattern around the circumfe rential surface of the roller is provided by spaced pairs 1,3,5 of rows 7,9,11,13 of pins extending parallel to the rotational axis of the roller, the spacing between the pairs 1,3,5 of rows being greater than the spacing between the rows 7,9 or 11,13 in each pair and in any pair 1,3 or 5 , the pins in one row 7 or 11 being staggered relative to those in the other row 9 or 13 . Preferably, for a 7¹ ₂ circumference roller approximately 1 wide, the pins in each row 7,9,11 or 13 , are spaced .1 apart and the rows 7,9 in a pair 1 are .03 apart and there are 28 pairs of rows 1,3,5 around the circumference. Preferably, the pins in one row 7 of a pair 1 are each spaced equidistant from their adjacent pins in the other row 9 and the pins in the first row 7 of each pair 1 are helically arranged and those in the second row 9 of each pair 1 also extend helically around the circumference of the roller.
