# HEAT PUMP SWITCHOVER VALVE

## Abstract
A switchover valve 20 is employed within a heat pump system 10 including a heat exchanger coil 14 within a structure 18 to be heated and cooled, and a second heat exchanger coil 16 external of the structure and in fluid communication with the first coil. The system also includes a compressor 12 which circulates a refrigerant between the coils to effect a net heat transfer into or out of the structure. The switchover valve operates to selectively reverse the flow of refrigerant between the coils, depending upon the operat ing mode of the system. The valve comprises a body 64 defining inlet and suction ports 22 28 for interconnection with the compressor and two reversing valve ports 36 40 for interconnection with the coils, a solenoid 196 operated pilot valve 153 and a slave valve 121 for selectively interconnecting the inlet port with one of the reversing valve ports, and a shuttle poppet valve 235 for interconnecting the suction port with the remaining reversing valve port.
