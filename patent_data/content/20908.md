# Data processing system comprising a common bus communication system in which the width of the address field is greater than the number of lines on the bus.

## Abstract
The technique for transmitting address information between a processor 10 and a plurality of memory subsystems 14, 18 in a common bus 4, 6, 8 communication system 2 . The width of the address field is greater than the number of lines on the bus 6 . For example, addresses are three bytes wide, and the bus 6 is one byte wide, thereby reducing the number of pins required on the processor and the subsystems. For communication between the processor and a given memory subsystem, only those bytes of a selected address which differ from the corresponding bytes of a previous address are transmitted sequentially for accessing a selected memory location.
