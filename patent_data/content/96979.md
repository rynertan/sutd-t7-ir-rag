# Multiple stage vibration damper.

## Abstract
A torsional vibration damper assembly providing a vari able torsional spring rate in conjunction with variable dam ping friction torque, which includes a hub having a radial flange 15 , a pair of intermediate drive plates 23, 24 carry ing the friction facings 28 and encompassing the hub flange, an outer pair of spring retainer plates 41, 41 axially disposed adjacent the drive plates, and damper springs re ceived in axially aligned spring windows formed in the re tainer plates, drive plates and hub flange. Rates and travel of the damper assembly to provide a multi stage operation are accomplished by modifying the locations or sizes of the damper springs, shape of the spring windows in the various plates, stop pins and or stop pin slots.
