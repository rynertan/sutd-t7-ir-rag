## Description
MULTI CONDUIT SEALING ASSEMBLY PROVIDING AN AIR TIGHT, LEAK RESISTANT SEAL BETWEEN COUPLED CONDUITS. THIS INVENTION RELATES TO THE COUPLING OF CONDUITS, AND MORE PARTICULARTO A SEALING ASSEMBLY FOR COUPLINGPAIRS OF CONDUITS SO AS TO PROVIDE ANAIR TIGHT, LEAK RESISTANT SEAL BETWEENTHE PAIRS OF CONDUITS. FURTHERMORE, THE SEALING ASSEMBLYAND COUPLED PAIRS OF CONDUITS CAN BECONTAINED IN AN EXTERNAL HOUSING TOPROTECT THE ASSEMBLY AND CONDUITS.SECTIONS OF EXTERNAL HOUSING ARE COUPLED TO ALSO PROVIDE AN AIR TIGHT, LEAKRESISTANT SEAL. ADDITIONALLY, A SUPPORTSPACER IS PROVIDED FOR SUPPORTING THEPAIRS OF CONDUITS AT SELECTED LOCATIONS WIHTIN THE HOUSING. MANY METHODS FOR JOINING A PAIR OFCONDUITS IN AN AIR TIGHT FASHION AREKNOWN IN THE ART. FOR EXAMPLE, ASSHOWN IN FIGURES 1 AND 2, CONDUITS 1 AND 2 ARE BROUGHT TOGETHER IN SLEEVE 3 ANDSEALED USING STANDARD SEALING COMPOUND 4 FIG.2 . THE SEALING COMPOUND ISUSUALLY A RUBBER OR SILICON BASED COMPOUND WHICH RESIST WATER PENETRATION.ALTHOUGH PROVIDING AN AIR TIGHT SEAL,THE APPLICATION OF THE COMPOUND MUSTBE CONTIGUOUS ABOUT THE PERIMETERS OFTHE SLEEVE ANY GAPS WILL DESTROY THEINTEGRITY OF THE SEAL. IN CLOSE WORK ENVIRONMENTS, IT MAY BE VERY DIFFICULT TOGET ACCESS TO THE ENTIRE SLEEVE S PERIMETER, THEREBY MAKING IT DIFFICULT TOPROPERLY APPLY THE COMPOUND. THE COMPOUND S APPLICATION IS ALSO TIME CONSUMING, IN ADDITION TO THE TIME REQUIREDFOR DRYING, THUS ADDING TO THE COST OFASSEMBLY. FURTHEFSMORE, THE COMPOUNDIS USUALLY PERMANENT DRYING, THEREBYMAKING IT IMPRACTICAL TO GAIN ACCESS TOTHE CONDUITS AT THAT POINT. ANOTHER METHOD FOR JOINING A PAIROF CONDUITS IS BY USING A THREADEDSLEEVE. THIS METHOD, HOWEVER, REQUIRESTHAT THE ENDS OF THE JOINING CONDUITSALSO BE THREADED. THIS REQUIREMENTADDS COST AND COMPLEXITY DUE TO THESEPARATE THREAD MACHINING STEP ANDTHE FACT THAT THE CONDUIT WALL DIAMETER WOULD HAVE TO BE THICKER TO PROVIDE A BASE FOR THE THREADS. THIS METHOD IS ALSO HIGLY IMPRACTIVAL WHEN USINGSTANDARD PLASTIC OR PVC CONDUITS, DUETO THE INHERENT LOW SHEAR STRENGTH.ALSO, SHOULD THE SLEEVE BE OVER TIGHTENED, FRACTURES DUE TO STRESS MAY RESULT, DESTROYING THE INTEGRITY OF THESEAL. ADDITIONALLY, THE THREADED SLEEVEASSEMBLY DOES NOT PROVIDE AN AIR TIGHTSEAL. THUS, A SEALING COMPOUND WOULDHAVE TO BE EMPLOYED, WITH ALL THE NEGATIVE ATTRIBUTES DISCUSSED ABOVE. IT IS ALSO KNOWN TO JOIN A PAIR OFCONDUITS USING A MALE FEMALE NONTHREADED CONDUIT ARRANGEMENT, ASSHOWN IN US PATENT NO. 3,872,894 ISSUEDTO STREIT, INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. STREIT SHOWS MULTIPLE INTERNALCONDUITS HOUSED IN AN EXTERIOR HOUSING.THE EXTERIOR HOUSING HAS BOTH A FEMALEEND, FLARED OUTWARDLY TO PROVIDE ABELL, AND A MALE END, TAPERED TO FIT INTOAN ADJOINING CONDUIT S FEMALE END. ARIBBED SEALING GASKET IS PROVIDED ONTHE MALE END TO AID THE SEAL S INTEGRITY.HOUSING SECTIONS ARE FURTHER SECUREDTOGETHER BY SPRING CLIPS, PLACED ABOUTTHE PERIPHERY OF THE MALE FEMALE CONNECTION, WHICH ARE APPLIED EITHER BYHAND PRESSURE OF BY HAMMERING THEMINTO PLACE. THIS METHOD, ALTHOUGH PROVIDING AN AIR TIGHT, LEAK RESISTANT SEAL IS VERY COSTLY FOR MANY REASONS THEEXTERIOR HOUSING REQUIRES MORE CONDUIT MATERIAL FOR THE FEMALE END THEHOUSING IS NOT STANDARD LABOR COSTSFOR THE APPLICATION OF THE SPRINGCLIPS AND THE COST OF SPRING CLIPS THEMSELVES. ADDITIONALLY, APPLICATION OF THESPRING CLIPS, IF TOO ROUGH, MAY DAMAGETHE PLASTIC OR POLYETHYLENE HOUSING.CONVERSELY, IF NOT ENOUGH PRESSURE ISAPPLIED, THE SPRING CLIPS MAY POP OFF.THUS, THE SPRING CLIPS MAY NOT BE VERYPRACTICAL. ANOTHER METHOD FOR JOINING PAIRS OFCONDUITS IS BY FITTING MALE TERMINALSOVER THE ENDS OF STANDARD CONDUITSAND JOINING THE TERMINALS IN A FEMALEUNION. SUCH A METHOD, FOR USE IN A BEVERAGE DISPENSING SYSTEM, IS SHOWN IN USPATENT NO. 3,590,855 ISSUED TO WOOLLEN,INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. THETERMINALS HAVE A FLANGE WITH AN 0BEING SEATED ABOUT THE PERIPHERY OF A PORTION OF THE FLANGE. THE O RING CREATES AN AIR TICHT, LEAK RESISTANT SEAL BETWEEN THE FLANGE AND THE FEMALE UNIONUSED TO JOIN THE CONDUITS VIA THE TERMINALS. THIS ARRANGEMENT ALLOWS SIMPLEDISCONNECT AND RECONNECT WITHOUT THENEED FOR O RING REPLACEMENT, FOR THEWEAR AND TEAR ON THE O RINGS ARESLIGHT. THIS METHOD, HOWEVER, REDUCESTHE USABLE INTERNAL DIAMETER OF THECONDUITS SINCE THE TERMINALS ALSO ATTACH TO THE CONDUIT S INTERIOR.IF FULLINTERNAL DIAMETER UTILIZATION IS IMPERATIVE, THIS METHOD IS HIGHLY UNSATISFACTORY. ADDITIONALLY, THE COST OF THESESPECIAL TERMINALS WILL ADD CONSIDERABLECOST TO A SYSTEM HAVING MANY SECTIONSOF CONDUIT WHICH NEED TO BE JOINED. THE ABOVE METHODS HAVE SERIOUSDRAWBACKS INCREASED COST OVER STANDARD CONDUITS EXPENSIVE SEALING DUE TOLABOR INTENSIVE JOINING METHODS QUESTIONABLE SEALING INTEGRITY DUE EITHER TOIMPROPER APPLICATION OF A SEALING COMPOUND OR TO POSSIBLE CONDUIT FRACTURES FROM OVER STRESSED SEALING ASSEMBLIES AND REDUCTION OF THE USABLEINTERNAL DIAMETER OF THE CONDUITS. ADDITIONALLY, WHEN USING NON STANDARD CONDUITS, THE ABILITY TO SHORTEN A CONDUITIS IMPEDED, SINCE CUTTING OFF ANY UNWANTED CONDUIT LENGTH WOULD ALSO CUT OFFAN ESSENTIAL SEALING MEMBER, SUCH ASTHREADS OR A PORTION OF THE MALE FEMALE CONNECTION MEANS. IT IS AN OBJECT OF THE PRESENT INVENTION TO PROVIDE A SEALING ASSEMBLYWHICH PROVIDES AN AIR TIGHT, LEAK RESISTANT SEAL BETWEEN STANDARD CONDUITPAIRS BEING JOINED. IT IS ALSO AN OBJECT OF THE PRESENTINVENTION TO PROVIDE A SEALING ASSEMBLYWHICH DOES NOT EXERT PRESSURE ON THECONDUIT PAIRS BEING JOINED. IT IS FURTHER AN OBJECT OF THEPRESENT INVENTION TO PROVIDE A SEALINGASSEMBLY WHICH QUICKLY JOINS CONDUITPAIRS AND WHICH REQUIRES MINIMUM LABORFOR JOINTURE. IT IS ADDITIONALLY AN OBJECT OF THEPRESENT INVENTION TO PROVIDE A SEALINGASSEMBLY WHICH PROVIDES AN AIR TIGHT,LEAK RESISTANT SEAL BETWEEN STANDARDMULIT CONDUIT PAIRS BEING JOINED, AND TODO SO ECONOMICALLY, QUICKLY, AND WITHOUT EXERTING PRESSURE ON THE MULTICONDUIT PAIRS BEING JOINED. THE PRESENT INVENTION IS DIRECTED TOA SEALING ASSEMBLY WHICH PROVIDES ANAIR TIGHT, LEAK RESISTANT SEAL BETWEENMULTIPLE PAIRS OF CONDUITS. THIS SEALINGASSEMBLY CAN BE USED IN FIBER OPTIC CABLE INSTALLATIONS AND OTHER APPLICATIONS WHERE THE INTEGRITY OF THE SEALBETWEEN CONDUIT PAIRS IS IMPERATIVE. IN ONE EMBODIMENT, THE SEALING ASSEMBLY COMPRISES A PAIR OF BRACES EACHHAVING SYMMETRICALLY LOCATED HOLESCORRESPONDING TO THE SIZE OF THE OUTERDIAMETER OF THE CONDUITS. EACH BRACEHOLDS THE TAIL END OF TE CONDUITS TO BEJOINED. THE THICKNESS OF THE BRACEALONE SUPPORTS THE TAIL END NO PRESSURE IS EXERTED ON THE TAIL END BY THEBRACE. PLACED BETWEEN THE PAIR OFBRACES IS A GASKET MEANS WHICH ALSOHAS HOLES SYMMETRICALLY LOCATED WITHRESPECT TO THE HOLES PLACED IN THEBRACES. THE GASKETS HOLES, HOWEVER,CORRESPOND TO THE THE SIZE OF THE INNER DIAMETER OF THE CONDUITS. IN THIS WAY, THE GASKET ACTS NOTONLY AS A SEAL BETWEEN BRACES, BUTALSO AS A SEAL BETWEEN THE TERMINAL ENDS OF THE ADJOINING CONDUITS. THE ENTIRE SEALING ASSEMBLY IS SECURED BY ANINTEGRAL LATCHING ARRANGEMENT, BUTMAY BE SECURED BY ANY NUMBER OF OTHERWAYS, SUCH AS A BOLT WINGNUT ARRANGEMENT OR GLUEING COMPOUND. IN ANOTHER EMBODIMENT, CONDUITS AREJOINED BY INSERTING ONE CONDUITTHROUGH A FIRST BRACE, PAST A GASKETMEANS AND INTO A SECOND BRACE WHERE ITCOMES TO A STOP ON ONE SIDE OF A STOPRING LOCATED IN AN ATTACHED SECONDBRACE. INSERTION OF THIS CONDUIT CAUSESTHE GASKET MEANS TO BEND INTO THE SECOND BRACE, AND THE SECOND BRACE ISTHEREFOR PROVIDED WITH A RACEWAY FORHOUSING THE PORTION OF THE GASKETMEANS WHICH IS BENT IN THIS WAY. THEADJOINING CONDUIT IS INSERTED FROM THESECOND BRACE WHERE IT COMES TO A STOPON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STOP RING. THEGASKET MEANS EXERTS PRESSURE ON THECONDUIT, THEREFORE PROVIDING AN AIRTIGHT AND LEAK RESISTANT SEAL ABOUT THEPERIPHERY OF THE CONDUIT. ADDITIONALLY,THE CONDUITS ARE OPTIONALLY SOLVENT WELDED TO THE SEALING ASSEMBLY TO INCREASE SEALING INTEGRITY AND INSUREPERMANENT PLACEMENT OF THE CONDUITSIN THE SEALING ASSEMBLY. THE ABOVE SEALING ASSEMBLIES PROVIDE AN AIR TIGHT AND LEAK RESISTANTSEAL, ALLOWING THE CONDUITS TO BEPLACED UNDERWATER, SUBSURFACE, ORABOVE GROUND ENVIRONMENTS WHILE PREVENTING LEAKAGE OF INTERNAL PRESSUREOR INFILTRATION OF FLUID INTO THE PAIRSOF THE CONDUITS. THIS AIR TIGHT SEAL HASBEEN FOUND TO BE VERY EFFECTIVE IN ALLOWING PLUGS TO BE BLOWN TRHOUGHLARGE NUMBERS OF ADJOINING CONDUITSWITHOUT LOSS OF THE MOTIVE FORCE, THUSALLOWING FOR MORE EFFICIENT THREADINGOF THE FIBER OPTIC CABLE THROUGH THELARGE NUMBER OF ADJOINING CONDUITS. TO PROTECT THE CONDUITS AND SEALINGASSEMBLY, AN OPTIONAL EXTERNAL HOUSINGCAN BE EMPLOYED. THE SEALING ASSEMBLYAND CONDUITS ARE PLACED INSIDE AN EXTERNAL HOUSING, ALONG WITH SUPPORTSPACERS. THE SUPPORT SPACERS ARE PROVIDEDWITH HOLES CORRESPONDING TO THE SIZEOF THE OUTER DIAMETER OF THE CONDUIT,AND THE SPACERS BOTH SUPPORT THE CONDUITS AND INSURE THEIR SYMMETRICALPLACEMENT WITHIN THE HOUSING. THE SUPPORT SPACERS ARE PLACED AT INTERVALS INTHE HOUSING DEPENDING ON THE CONDUITS LOAD. SECTIONS OF THE EXTERNAL HOUSINGARE CONNECTED BY A CONVENTIONAL SEALING MEANS, SUCH AS A RUBBER OR THERMOPLASTIC RIBBED SEAL AND SLEEVE ASSEMBLY. THE EXTERNAL HOUSING S SEALINGMEANS ALSO PROVIDES AN AIR TIGHT ANDLEAK RESISTANT SEAL, FURTHER INSULATINGTHE MULTIPLE PAIRS OF CONDUITS AND SEALING ASSEMBLY.

EACH BRACE HAS A MULTIPLICITY OFHOLES H, THROUGH H4 WHICH ARE PREFERABLY SYMMETRICALLY LOCATED ABOUT EACHBRACE IN A CONCENTRIC FASHION. THEHOLES H, THROUGH H4 CORRESPOND TO THEOUTER DIAMETER DIMENSIONS OF CONDUITS 33 33 THROUGH 36 36 , RESPECTIVELY.CONDUIT PAIRS 33, 33 NEED NOT BE IDENTICAL TO ANY OTHER CONDUIT PAIR, AND IT ISTO BE UNDERSTOOD THAT THIS INVENTION ISNOT SO LIMITED. ALL THAT IS REQUIRED ISTHAT INDIVIDUAL CONDUIT PAIRS HAVE THESAME INNER DIAMETERS. IN THE PREFERREDEMBODIMENT, HOWEVER, CONDUITS 33 33 THROUGH 36 36 ARE IDENTICAL. BRACES 31 AND 32 CAN BE MADE OF RUBBER, THERMOPLASTIC, NYLON, OR THE LIKE, AND IN THEPREFERRED EMBODIMENT BRACES 31 AND 32ARE MADE OF NYLON. PLACED BETWEEN BRACES 31 AND 32 ISGASKET MEANS 37 HAVING A MULTIPLICITY OFHOLES Gl THROUGH G4 WHICH ARE LOCATEDSYMMETRICALLY WITH RESPECT TO HOLES H,THROUGH H4, RESPECTIVELY, ON BRACES 31AND 32. HOLES Gl THROUGH G4 CORRESPONDTO THE INNER DIAMETER DIMENSIONS OFCONDUITS 33 33 THROUGH 36 36 , RESPECTIVELY. GASKET MEANS 37 CAN BE MADE OFRUBBER, THERMOPLASTIC, NYLON, CORK, ORTHE LIKE AND IN THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT GASKET MEANS 37 IS MADE OF RUBBER. THE SEALING ASSEMBLY IS SECURELY ATTACHED TOGETHER BY SECURING MEANS,SUCH AS BOLT WINGNUT, RIVETS, SCREWS,GLUEING BRACES 31 AND 32 TO GASKETMEANS 37, OR THE LIKE. IN THE PREFERREDEMBODIMENT, BRACE 31 HAS A MULTIPLICITYOF LATCHING PROJECTIONS NOT SHOWN INFIGURE 3 RESIDING NEAR THE PERIPHERY OFITS CIRCUMFERENCE. THESE PROJECTIONS 41, ILLUSTRATED IN FIGURE 4, ARE AT THEPERIPHERY OF BRACE 31 AND EXTEND A SIAT ANCE EQUAL TO THE WIDTH OF GASKETMEANS 37 AND BRACE 32, TERMINATING INHOOK ARRANGEMENT 42. BRACE 32 AND GASKET MEANS 37 ARE LARGER THAN BRACE 31AND HAVE HOLES CORRESPONDING IN SIZEAND POSITION TO THE PROJECTIONS OFBRACE 31. THE SEALING ASSEMBLY IS SECURED BY PROJECTIONS 41 EXTENDINGTHROUGH GASKET MEANS 37 AND BRACE 32,ILLUSTRATED IN FIGURE 5, SECURELY LATCHING TO BRACE 32 BY HOOK 42.THE LATCHINGPROJECTIONS COULD ALSO LATCH OVER THESECOND BRACE, WHERE THE SECOND BRACEIS SMALLER THAN THE FIRST BRACE. THISPROVIDES A TIGHT SEAL WITH MINIMAL LABOR. THE SEALING ASSEMBLY CAN BE DISASSEMBLED BY APPLYIN AN INWARD FORCEON HOOK 42, AS IS WELL KNOWN IN THE ART.A SEALING COMPOUND, EITHER HARDENINGOR NON HARDENING, MAY ALSO BE USED TOHELP SECURE GASKET MEANS 37 TO BRACES 31 AND 32. TURNING NOW TO FIGURE 6, ANOTHEREMBODIMENT OF THE SEALING ASSEMBLY OFTHE PRESENT INVENTION IS ILLUSTRATED. ASSHOWN IN FIGURE 6, SEALING ASSEMBLY 60COMPRISES BRACE 61 AND GASKET MEANS 66TRHOUGH 69. THE GASKET MEANS 66THROUGH 69 HAVE AN OUTER DIAMETER CORRESPONDING TO THE OUTER DIAMETER OFCONDUITS 33 33 THROUGH 36 36 , RESPECTIVELY, AND AN INNER DIAMETER CORRESPONDING TO THE INNER DIAMETER OF CONDUITS 33 33 THROUGH 36 36 , RESPECTIVELY. THIS EMBODIMENT ALSO PROVIDES ANAIR TIGHT, LEAK RESISTANT SEAL BETWEENADJOINING CONDUITS. IN YET ANOTHER EMBODIMENT OF THESEALING ASSEMBLY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION, GASKET MEANS 66 THROUGH 69 OF FIGURE 6 HAVE OUTER DIAMETERS SLIGHTLYLARGER THAN CONDUITS 33 33 THROUGH 36 36 , RESPECTIVELY. BRACE 61 IS PROVIDEDWITH AN INTERNAL RECESS IN EACH HOLE H, THROUGH H4, AND THE DEPTH OF THE RECESS CORRESPONDS TO THE DIFFERENCEBETWEEN THE GASKET MEANS OUTER DIAMETER AND THE CONDUITS OUTER DIAMETER.THE GASKET MEANS WOULD BE A FLEXIBLEMATERIAL, SUCH AS RUBBER, SO THAT THEYCOULD BE INSERTED IN THE RECESSTHROUGH THE HOLE EASILY A D WITHOUTDAMAGE. TURNING NOW TO FIGURE 7, A CUT AWAYVIEW OF AN EXTERNAL HOUSING ABOUT THESEALING ASSEMBLY EMBODIMENT OF FIGURE 3 IS SHOWN. FOR ILLUSTRATION AND CLARITY, ONLY ONE CONDUIT PAIR, 33 AND 33 , ISILLUSTRATED. IT IS TO BE UNDERSTOOD,HOWEVER, THAT THIS ASPECT OF THEPRESENT INVENTION IS NOT LIMITED TO ONLYONE CONDUIT PAIR . SEALING ASSEMBLY 30 ISSUPPORTED AROUND ITS PERPHERY BY ANEXTERNAL HOUSING, SHOWN IN THIS CUTAWAY VIEW AS 71 AND 71 . CONDUIT 33 EXTENDS THROUGH SUPPORT BRACE 73, DESCRIBED FURTHER WITH REFERENCE TO FIGURE 8, AND BRACE 31, ABUTTING ONE SIDE OFGASKET MEANS 37 AT ITS TERMINAL WALL. CONDUIT 33 EXTENDS THROUGH BRACE 32,ABUTTING THE OTHER SIDE OF GASKETMEANS 37 AT ITS TERMINAL WALL. AS ISCLEARLY SHOWN, THE INNER DIAMETER OFCONDUITS 33 AND 33 ALIGN WITH THE HOLEIN GASKET MEANS 37. IN THIS WAY, A CONTINUOUS INNER DIAMETER IS PRESENT, WITH OUT ANY DISCONTINUITIES AT THE CONDUITSJOINTURE. SECTIONS OF EXTERNAL HOUSINGCAN BE JOINED IN ANY CONVENTIONAL MANNER NOT SHOWN , WELL KNOWN TO THOSESKILLED IN THE ART. TURNING NOW TO FIGURE 8, THE SUPPORT SPACER 73 OF FIGURE 7 IS SHOWN, THESUPPORT SPACER 73 IS PROVIDED WITHHOLES CORRESPONDING TO THE CONDUITSOUTER DIMENSIONS FOR SUPPORTING THECONDUITS. THE SPACER S OUTER DIMENSIONS CORRESPOND TO THE EXTERNALHOUSING S INNER DIMENSIONS. SUPPORTSPACERS ARE PLACED AT INTERVALS IN THEHOUSING TO HELP SUPPORT THE LOAD WHICHIS CARRIED BY THE CONDUITS AND TO INSURE THE OCNDUlTS SYMMETRICAL PLACEMENT WIHTIN THE HOUSING. THE CONDUITLOAD WILL DETERMINE THE SUPPORT SPACER PLACEMENT, AND IN THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT, ONE SUPPORT SPACER IS LOCATED MIDWAY BETWEEN ADJACENT SEALING ASSEMBLIES. TURNING NOW TO FIGURE 9, A CUT AWAYVIEW OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OFTHE EXTERNAL HOUSING SEALING ASSEMBLYIS SHOWN, HERE, EXTERNAL HOUSING SECTIONS, 71, 71 AND 72, 72 ARE JOINED BYSLEEVE 91. IN THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT,SLEEVE 91 FORMS AN AIR TIGHT, LEAK RESISTANT SEAL ABOUT EXTERNAL HOUSING SECTIONS 71, 71 AND 72, 72 BY A RIBBED SEAL NOT SHOWN , ALTHOUGH OTHER METHODSMAY BE EMPLOYED, AS IS WELL KNOWN TOTHOSE SKILLED IN THE ART. THE SEALING ASSEMBLY 30 IS PREFERABLY CENTERED INSLEEVE 91, AND CAN OPTIONALLY BE AFFIXEDTO SLEEVE 91 BY A SEALING COMPOUND.SUPPORT SPACERS 73 SUPPORT CONDUITS 33AND 33 , AND ARE LOCATED A SUITABLE DISTANCE FROM SEALING ASSEMBLY 30, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. TURNING NOW TO FIGURE 10, AN ISOMETRIC VIEW OF ANOTHER EMBODIMENT OF THESEALING ASSEBMLY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION IS ILLUSTRATED. SEALING ASSEMBLY 110INCLUDES BRACES 111 AND 112 ABOUT GASKET 113. IN THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT,THE BRACES ARE MADE FROM INJECTIONMOLDED PVC PLASTIC, AND THE GASKET ISRUBBER CONFORMING TO ASTM STANDARD F477. THE BRACES AND GASKET CAN BEJOINED IN ANY CONVENTIONAL MANNER. INTHE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT, PINS NOTSHOWN EMANATING FROM BRACE 111 EXTEND THROUGH GASKET 113 AND BRACE 112WHERE THEY ARE HEATED AND PRESSEDDOWN TO THE SURFACE OF BRACE 112, FORMING A FLANGE WHICH SECURELY ATTACHESTHE BRACES TO THE GASKET. TURNING NOW TO FIGURE 11, A CUT AWAYVIEW FROM LINES A A OF ASSEMBLY 110 OFFIGURE 10 IS SHOWN, AND INCLUDES RACEWAYS 114 AND STOP RINGS 115. THE CONDUITS TO BE JOINED ENTER THE ASSEMBLYTROUGH OPENINGS 119 AND 118 OF BRACE 111 AND BRACE 112, RESPECTIVELY. THEBRACES ARE PREFERABLY BEVELED ATTHESE OPENINGS TO FACILITATE CONDUITENTRY. ADDITIONALLY, THE CONDUITS WHICHENTER AT BRACE 11 ARE ALSO PREFERABLYBEVELED TO MINIMIZE DAMAGE TO THE GASKET AS IT SLIDES THROUGH BRACE 111, PASTGASKET 113, AND INTO BRACE 112 WHERE ITSTOPS AT STOP RINGS 115. AS SHOWN AT 116, THE CONDUITS WHICH ENTER AT BRACE 111 CAUSE THE OVERHANGING PORTIONS OFGASKET 113 TO LIE IN RACEWAYS 114. THEGASKET PRESSURE ON THE CONDUITS AT 116CREATES AN AIR TIGHT AND LEAK RESISTANTSEAL ABOUT ITS PERIPHERY. THE CONDUIT SBEVEL IS PREFERABLY SYMMETRIC WITH RESPECT TO THE STOP RING S BEVEL AT 117.ONCE THE CONDUITS HAVE BEEN INSERTEDINTO THE SEALING ASSEMBLY, THEY AREPREFERABLY SOLVENT WELDED AT OPENINGS 118 AND 119 TO INCREASE SEALING INTEGRITY AND ENSURE PERMANENT PLACEMENTOF THE CONDUITS IN THE SEALING ASSEMBLY. ADDITIONALLY, AN OPTIONAL EXTERNALHOUSING CAN BE EMPLOYED TO FURTHERPROTECT THE CONDUITS AND SEALING ASSEMBLY. IN ALL SEALING ASSEMBLY EMBODIMENTSDISCUSSED ABOVE, FOUR PAIR OF CONDUITSARE ILLUSTRATED. HOWEVER, ANY OTHERNUMBER OF CONDUITS COULD BE SO JOINED,THE RELEVANT PARAMETERS BEING THE OUT ER DIMENSION OF THE BRACES AND THECONDUIT S OUTER DIAMETERS. THE CONDUITS PLACEMENT ABOUT THE BRACES IS ADESIGN CHOICE, ALTHOUGH ONE PLACEMENTMAY BE PREFERRED OVER ANOTHER DUE TOGEOMETRICAL ADVANTAGES SUCH AS HEXAGONAL CLOSE PACK, FOR EXAMPLE. ADDITIONALLY, THIS INVENTION IS NOT LIMITED TOPLASTIC OR PVC CONDUITS, AND ANY OTHER CONtENTIONAL CONDUIT MATERIAL, SUCH ASMETAL, GLASS, OR GLASS LINED, WOULDALSO WORK. A CHANGE IN THE CONDUIT TYPEMAY ALSO PRECIPITATE A NEED TO CHANGEGASKET TYPE SO THAT THE TWO MATERIALSARE COMPATIBLE. FURTHERMORE, SEALING ASSEMBLY AND SUPPORT SPACER DIMENSIONS ARE DETERMINED ACCORDING TO CONDUIT MATERIAL TYPE AND SIZE, AS WELL ASLOAD SUPPORTING CHARACTERISTICS. IT IS FURTHER TO BE UNDERSTOOD THAT,ALTHOUGH ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS OFTHE PRESENT INVENTION HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED IN DETAIL WITH REFERENCE TO THEACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS, THE PRESENT INVENTION IS NOT LIMITED TO THOSE PRECISEEMBODIMENT. VARIOUS CHANGES OR MODIFICATIONS MAY BE EFFECTED THEREIN BYONE SKILLED IN THE ART WITHOUT DEPARTING FROM THE SCOPE OR SPIRIT OF THE INVENTION.
