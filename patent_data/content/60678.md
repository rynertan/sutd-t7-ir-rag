# Method of protecting plants from nematodes.

## Abstract
A method of protecting plants from plant parasitic nema todes comprises applying to the locus of the nematode infestation a plant protective amount of A. 0,0 diethyl o 5 phenylisoxazol 3 yl phosphorothio ate, and B. at least one of 1 methyl N methylamino carbonyl oxy ethanimido thioate, 2 methyl 2 dimethylamino N methylamino carbo nyl oxy 2 oxoethanimidothioate and 3 2 methyl 2 methylthio propionaldehyde 0 methylcar bamoyloxime, the weight ratio of A to B being in the range of about 1 10 to about 10 1. The components A and B may be formulated into a nemat icidal composition by admixture with a carrier, diluent and or surfactant.
