# Optical disk and method for reproducing reference signal therefrom.

## Abstract
In an optical disk, pits of the reference signals in header regions are disposed to be apart each other in longitudinal direction of the groove, and thereby undesirable interference or crosstalk of the reference signals in neighboring V grooves are eliminated and in reproducing of such refer ence signals, two laser beam spots are irradiated on a pair of oblique surface tracks in a groove, and two electric signals made by detecting two reflection lights are examined whether they have coincidence, and when the coincidence is confirmed the signals are used as valid reference signals.
