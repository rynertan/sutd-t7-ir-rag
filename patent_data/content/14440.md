## Description
metal derivatives and the use thereof as intermediate products.This invention relates to a ketal derivative and the use thereof as intermediate products. Particularly the invention relates to a ketal derivative that can be employed as an intermediate product or heparin Suprofen a registered trademark which shows ovominent analgesic and anti inflammatory effects.Heretofore known processes for preparing Suprofen are as follows 1 a process in which p f luorobenzoyl chloride is reacted seouently with thiophene and methyl malonate See German Offenlegungsschrif, P 23 53 357 2 a process in which fluorobenzene is reacted with 2thenoyl chloride and the resulting product then is redacted with methyl malonate See Chemical Abstracts 84, 43737x 3 a process in which a phenylacetylene derivative is treated with thallium nitrate See Japanese PatentProvisional Publication JPPP No. 52 36642 4 a process in which a diester is, in the first stage, alkylated and then subjected to hydrolysis and decarboxZ lation See JPPP No. 49 93346 5 a process in which an aretophenone derivative is subjected to willgerodt reaction in the presence of rhodanine See JPPP NG. 49 93346 6 a process in wghic l an alpha haloethylbenzene derivative is subjected to cyanation followed by hydrolysis See JPPPNo. 49 93346 and P.G.P. Van Daele et al., Arzneim porch, 25, 1495 1975 and others. These process have certain drawbacks such as rather long reaction route, the use of starting materials not so readily available, the involvement of reaction stages giving low yields, and so forth. Therefore, these processes do not appear to be ones industrially applicable.In the processes, the process 6 is considered to be most industrially advantageous and the process 6 is illustrated as follows EMI2.1 in which Y is a halogen atom.In this synthetic route, the reaction of the compound 2 , i.e., 1 halogenoethyl phenyl thienyl ketone, to yield the compound 3 , i.e., l cyanoethyl phenvl thienyl ketone, also gives a substantial amount of a by product having the formula 2 EMI3.1 and this means a decreased yield of the compound 2 and also means a decreased yield of the compound 4 , i.e.,Suprofen, which is naturally disadvantageous.As a result of earnest studies on intermediates for obtaining Suprofen in good yield which then obviates the drawbacks mentioned above, the present inventors have achieved this invention upon finding that a ketal derivative in which the carbonyl group in the para position is converted to a ketal can produce Suprofen in a high yield.Accordingly, the primary object of this invention is to provide a novel ketal derivative of value as an intermediate for preparing Suprofen and such use. Other objects will be apparent from the contents of this specification.The ketal derivative of this invention has the formula I EMI3.2 in which R1 and R2 individually represent alkyl groups, or R1 and R2 may together form an alkylene group, and X is a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom or a cano group.In the formula I , each of R1 and R2 is the same or different, and preferably represents a lower alkyl group of from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl and n butyl. Preferred examples of the alkylene group include substituted or unsubstituted dimethylene or. trimethylene groups of from 2 to 6 carbon atoms such as ethylene, l methylethylene, propylene, 2methylpropylene and 2,2 dimethylpropylene. The halogen included within the symbol X is preferred to be chlorine or bromine.Examples of the compound I of this invention include 4 ethylphenyl 2 thienyl dimethoxymethane, 4 ethylphenyl 2 thienyl diethoxymethane, 4 ethylphenyl 2 thier.yl di n butylmethane, 2 4 ethylphenyl 2 thienyl 3 1, 3 dioxolane, 2 4 ethylphenyl 2 thienyl l,3 dioxane, 2 4 ethylphenyl 2 thienyl 5,5 dimethyl l,3 dioxane, 4 1 chloroethyl phenbtl3 2 thienyl dimethoxymethane, 14 1 bromoethyl phenyl 2 thienyl dimethoxymethane, 4 1 chloroethyl phenyl 2 thienyl diethoxymethane, 4 1bromoethyl phenyl 2 thienyl diethoxymethane, 4 1 chloroethyl phenyl 2 thienyl l,3 dioxolane, 4 1brmoethyl phenyl 2 thienyl 1,3 dioxolane, 4 1 cyanoethyl phenyl 2 thienyl dimethoxymethane, 4 1 cyanoethyl phenyl 2 thienyl diethoxymethane, and 2 4 1 cyanoethyl phenyl 2 thienyl 1,3 dioXolane. A compound of the formula I according to this invention can be synthesized, for example, by the following steps.EMI4.1 EMI5.1 In the above formulae I 1 , 1 2 and I 3 , R1,R2 and X have the same meanings as defined hereinbefore.The first step is directed to the synthesis of the compound I 1 , i.e., 4 ethylphenyl 2 thienyl dialkoxymethane which comprises the reaction of the compound 11 , i.e., ethylphenyl thienyl ketone, with an alcohol or ortho ester. The compound 11 of the starting compound can be readily prepared by the reaction of ethylbenzene with thenoyl chloride or the reaction of p ethylbenzoyl chloride with thiophene under the FriedelCrafts reaction conditions. See N. P. BunHoi et al.,Bull. Soc. Chim. Fr., 447 1959 . Examples of the alcohol employed include lower alcohols of from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, such as methanol, ethanol, n propanol, isopropanol and butanol.Each of the alcohols can be employed alone or in corbination. Examples of the orthoester include methyl orthoformate, ethyl orthoformate, ethyl orthoacetate and ethyl orthosilicate.The reaction of the first step is preferably carried out in the presence of an acidic substance so as to accelerate its reaction rate. Examples of the acidic substance incluG rganic acids such as acetic acid, and p toluenesulfonic acid mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid Lewis acids such as iron chloride, zinc chloride and titanium tetrachloride ammonium salts such as ammonium sulfate and ammonium chloride and acidic resins such as Amberlist 15 trade name, Rohm BR Haas Company . The acidic substance can be employed in a catalytic or equivalent amount as compared with the amount of the starting compound compound I . For carrying out this reaction, a solvent can be employed.Examples of the solvent, that do not participate in the reaction, include hydrocarbon type solvents such as hexane, benzene, toluene and xylene ether type solvents such as ether and dioxane and halogenated hydrocarbon type solvents such as carbon tetrachloride, in addition to the aforementioned alcohols involved in the reaction. The reaction can be carried out under cooling in ice or a temperature up to 200 OC. Room temperature or the refluxing temperature of the solvent employed is preferably adopted for facilitating the procedures.The second step is directed to the synthesis of the compound I 2 , i.e., 4 l halogenoethyl phenyl 2 thienyl dialkoxymethane which comprises the reaction of the compound I 1 obtained in the first step, i.e., 4 ethylphenyl 2 thienyl dialkoxmethane, with a halogenating agent. Examples of the halogenating agent include halogenated imides such as N bromusuccinimide and N chlorosuccinimide chlorine 3bromine t butyl hypobromide trichloromethanesulfonyl chloride and trichlorobromomethane. The reaction of the second step is preferably carried out under conditions producing radicals so that the reaction can be accelerated and that the yield of the product can be increased. The conditions producing a a registered trademark radicals can be readily attained, for example, by causing a radical producing agent present in the reaction mixture or placing the reaction mixture under the radiation of light. Examples of the radical producing agent include organic peroxides such as benzoyl peroxide, diacetyl peroxide and di t butyl peroxide azo compounds such as azobisisobutyronitrile and transition metal compounds such as iron chloride, copper oxide, palladium complexes and rbodiuin complexes.The reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of a solvent. Examples of the solvent that can be employed include halogenated hydrocarbons such as carbon tetrachloride and chloroform aromatic hydrocarbons sueh as benzene and other hydrocarbons such as hexane and cyclohexane. The solvent ought not to participate in the reaction.The reaction temperature may vary depending upon the reaction conditions actually employed, but generally is between room temperature and 150 OC. The reaction temperature preferably ranges from room temperature to temperatures around the reflux temperature of the solvent employed, for facilitating the procedures.The third step is directed to the synthesis of the compound I 3 , i.e., 4 l cyanoethyl phenyl 2 thienyl dialkoxymethane which comprises the reaction of the compound I 2 obtained in the second step, i.e., 4 l halogenoethyl phenyl 2 thienyl dialkoxymethane, with a metallic cyanide. Examples of the metallic cyanide that can be employed include sodium cyanide, potassium cyanide and copper cyanide.The reaction of this step is preferably carried out in the presence of a solvent. Examples of the solvent that can be employed include aprotic polar solvents such as dimethylsulfoxide, dmethylformamide and hexamethylphosphoramide alcohols such as methanol and ethanol and aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene and toluene.An aprotic polar solvent is preferably employed for rendering the reaction smooth.The compound IIII obtained in this step, i.e., 4 1 cyanoethel phenyl3 2 thienyl dialkoxymethane, can be hydrolyzed under an acidic condition to produce theSuprofen in a good yield. In this reaction for preparingSuprofen,the acidic condition can be set by incorporating an acidic substance in the reaction mixture. Examples of the acidic substance include mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid and organic acids such as formic acid and acetic acid.A mineral acid is preferably employed, because the mineral acid is economical and can render the reaction smooth. The organic acid can also serve as a solvent.The amount of the acidic substance employed is not limited and may vary depending upon the reaction conditions. The amount of the acidic substance accordingly is between a catalytic amount and a very excessive one as compared with the amount of the starting cyano compound, i.e., the compound 1 3 . In carrying out the hydrolysis reaction, water is employed in an amount of not less than three times the molar equivalents of the starting compound I 3 . If necessary, a water miscible solvent such as an organic solvent stated hereinbefore or an ether, e.g., dioxane or dimethoxyethane can be employed in conjunction with the water. The reaction can be carried out at a temperature between room temperature and 150 OC., and a temperature around 100 OC. or the reflux temperature of the solvent employed is preferably used.
