# Differential linkage apparatus for an aircraft series servoactuator apparatus.

## Abstract
In a servoactuator system for an aircraft, a strapdown series servoactuator having an external linkage assembly 115 is coupled between the pilot s control stick 20 and a control surface member. The external linkage assembly 115 includes a differential link 130 and servo link 132 having specially tapered stop surfaces 131, 133 adapted to be varied in dimensions to accommodate a wide variety of installations, which stop surfaces are cooperable with fixed stops 141, 142 143, 144 on the servoactuator housing 10a whereby to provide a variety of pilot authority limits and series servo authority limits depending upon particular installation requirements.
