# UNDERWATER SEISMIC TESTING

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method of estimating the acoustic signatures of seismic sources, used in underwater seismic surveying, in order to obtain more accurate data on their wave form in the far field. The pressure response produced by an array of sources is sampled by a hydrophone array larger in size than that of the array of sources and positioned relatively far from the array of sources the individual response of each of the hydrophones in the hydrophone array is measured separately, and the wave form of the source array signature is calculated from these measurements. The hydrophone responses can be analysed in order to give a numerical reconstruction of the configura tion of the source array together with its reflected image at the water air boundary, or they can be extrapolated directly to the location of interest in the far field.
