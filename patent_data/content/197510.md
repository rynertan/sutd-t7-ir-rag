# A surfactant composed of acylated collagen or acylated gelatin and a production process thereof.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a surfactant composed of acylated collagen or acylated gelatine produced by the acylation of the side chain amino radicals of collagen or gelatine with an aliphatic acid having 2 26 carbon atoms and a dicarboxylic acid having 2 8 carbon atoms and a produc tion process thereof. Since it has less toxicity and irritation against the human body and can dissolve in a neutral solution of pH 6 8 in the form of molecular dispersion, the surfactant is especially suitable for use in the field of cosmetic and foodstuff industries.
