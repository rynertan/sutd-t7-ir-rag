# Ultrasonic identification of damage in lined structures.

## Abstract
A method of testing the integrity of the internal lining of a hollow body, especially a pipeline, by transmitting an ultrasonic wave from the exterior of the body through the adjacent wall of the body and monitoring the wave, if any, reflected from the opposite wall. In many cases, especially concrete linings, an intact or partially intact lining on the adjacent wall will absorb the ultrasonic wave and there is no reflected wave. A reflected wave frequently indicates loss of the lining on the adjacent wall although in some cases depending on, for example, the thickness of the lining or the material of which it is made, a reflected wave may be obtained even when the lining is intact. In such cases comparison of the reflected wave with predetermined stan dards provides an indication of whether or not the lining is intact.
