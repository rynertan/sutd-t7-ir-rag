The invention extends to a matrix multi colour display device comprising a matrix of thin film transistors arranged in rows and columns deposited on a first substrate, each transistor of each row having its gate electrode connected to a corresponding row electrode, each transistor of each column having its source electrode connected to a corresponding column electrode, and each transistor having its drain electrode connected to a corresponding display electrode, a counter electrode deposited on a second substrate, and display material disposed between the first and second substrates, characterised by a matrix of conductive layers, each corresponding to one of said transistors, being connected to a corresponding row electrode or to a corresponding column electrode, and having electro deposited thereon a colour filter of a selected colour, and in that each of said display electrodes is deposited on a colour filter. Preferably the colour filters are electro deposited from solutions containing a polymer and colouring matter by selective application of an electro deposition voltage to the row electrode or to the column electrode. The colouring matter may be a dye. Preferably the polymer is an acrylic resin containing carboxyl groups of a polyester resin containing carboxyl groups. The invention is illustrated, merely by way of example, in the accompanying drawings, in which Throughout the drawings like parts have been designated by the same reference numerals. Figure 1 shows a conventional matrix multi colour display device using thin film transistors TFTs . In this conventional matrix multi colour display device, thin film transistors 1 are arranged in a matrix in such a manner that their gate electrodes 7 are connected in rows to row drivers R₁ R Figure 2 shows a section through the matrix multi colour display device of Figure 1. First, two substrates 6,11 are prepared, the substrates 6 having the counter electrode 5 which is transparent over its entire surface and the substrate 11 carrying the gate electrode 7 made of Chromium or Aluminium, a gate electrode pad 8 connected to each gate electrode 7, an insulation layer 9 of silicon oxide SiO or aluminium oxide Al₂O₃ over the pads 8, and a semiconductor layer 10 of CdSe or CdS. Source lines 12 of aluminium are formed on top of the semiconductor layer 10 in a direction at right angles to the gate electrodes 7, and a display cell is formed at each intersection of column lines and row lines. The display electrode 13 for each display cell consists of a transparent conductive layer and is connected to the respective drain electrode 14. Each display electrode 13 not only serves as a display electrode but also forms one electrode of the respective capacitor 4 together with the gate electrode pad 8 of the adjacent thin film transistor. The colour filters 2 are formed on the display electrodes 13, and the display material 3 fills the space between the substrate 6 and the substrate 11. In this matrix multi colour display device, a voltage is applied between specific rows and columns to turn on selected transistors so that a voltage is applied across the display material, the optical shutter is operated, and the colour of the colour filters of the selected display cells is displayed. Thus, a multi colour display device which can be matrix driven can be obtained by changing the colours of the colour filters of the display cells. A multi colour display using colour filters is extremely effective because the method is easy and simple to practice, any desired colour can be obtained, and various display materials and systems can be combined. When manufacturing this type of matrix multi colour display device, however, the pattern of display electrodes and the pattern of colour filters formed on the surface of the display electrodes must be arranged so that there is no discrepancy between them. Particularly when making a colour graphic display device using a fine pattern of the three primary colours, there is a serious problem that it is very difficult to form the display electrodes and colour filters without any discrepancy between them. Changing colours to realize a multi colour display is another problem which makes the production process complicated. Particularly, when the colouring is effected by the use of dyes, resist printing steps must be included to prevent the portions that have already been dyed from being dyed again in subsequent dyeing steps, making the production process all the more complicated. In addition, the resist printing technique itself presents difficult problems which must be solved independently. To produce the colour filters, screen printing, photolithography and like methods are generally used. Resists are not necessary when using screen printing but there is a limit to the miniaturisation of the pattern that can be produced, so that the greater the number of colours to be displayed, the lower the positional accuracy and thus the greater the discrepancies in the display pattern. Photolithography can provide a fine pattern, but a photolithographic step is necessary for each colour, and resist printing must be provided between dye steps to prevent re dyeing. Thus, the production process becomes complicated, and the advantage of a simple means of realizing a multi colour display can no longer be obtained. Hereinafter, a method of forming a coloured layer by the electrodeposition of a polymer, which is an essential feature of the present invention, will be described. A method of electrochemically polymerising a monomer on an electrode is one of the methods by which a polymer can be electrodeposited on the electrode. A method by which various vinyl compounds are electrochemically polymerised on an iron sheet to obtain a polymer film has been reported Metal Surface Technology, Vol.19, No. 12, 1968 . Recently, much research has been done on the formation of a conductive polymer such as a polypyrrole or polythienylene by electrochemically polymerising a pyrrole, or thiophene. However, these direct methods of electrochemically polymerising a monomer are not yet suitable for use in making matrix multi colour display devices because their efficiency is still low, the resultant film is already coloured, and the colouring can not be done as required. Another method of electrodepositing a polymer onto an electrode involves making the polymer insoluble and precipitating it onto the electrode from a polymer solution. One example of such a method is the so called electrodeposition coating method in which a pigment is dispersed in an aqueous polymer solution, a piece of metal is dipped into the solution to act as an electrode, and a coloured layer is electrodeposited onto the metal. This method is used industrially for coating bodies of automobiles. According to this method, a hydrophilic group such as a carboxyl group is introduced into the polymer and the carboxyl group is neutralized and made water soluble by an inorganic alkali, an organic amine, etc. An electrode is then dipped into the aqueous solution of the polymer, which is now water soluble, and when a voltage is applied, the carboxyl anions that have been dissociated in the aqueous solution move by electrophoresis towards the anode and react on the electrode with protons generated by the electrolysis of water, so that the polymer is made insoluble and precipitates. In other words, the reaction expressed by the following equation occurs on the anode, and precipitation of the polymer can be observed This deposition of the polymer can be observed on the cathode. Conversely, if a basic group such as a polyamine is used as the hydrophilic group, and it is neutralised and made water soluble by an acid, the polymer is deposited on the anode. If the polymer thus electrodeposited is electrically dielectric, it is believed that the electrode will be coated with the polymer and the current will then decrease, thus preventing any further growth of the coating so that no increase in the film thickness can be expected. In practice, however, a complete coating during the initial stages is prevented by bubbles of nascent oxygen resulting from the electrolysis of the water, and a film of a certain thickness can be obtained before an insulating layer is formed. With electrodeposition coating, an impressed voltage of 100 to 200 V is generally used to obtain a film which is 10 to 20 µm in thickness. For a matrix multi colour display device thinner colour films are desirable. Accordingly, the resin concentration, the voltage and the solvent composition must be set to optimum values as described in the Examples below. Due to the effect of electro osmosis, the resultant film has a lower water content and is uniform with a higher bondability compared to a film formed by electrodeposition coating. Examples of polymers for anionic electrodeposition include, for example, adducts of natural dry oils and maleic acid, alkyd resins into which carboxyl groups are introduced, adducts of epoxy resins and maleic acid, polybutadiene resins into which carboxyl groups are introduced, copolymers of acrylic or methacrylic acid and their esters. Depending upon the properties of the electrodeposited film, other polymers or organic compounds with functional groups can sometimes be introduced into the polymer structure. When light is observed through a colour filter, the coloured filter must be transparent and an acrylic or polyester resin is suitable for this purpose. The number of hydrophilic groups such as carboxyl or hydroxyl groups added to the polymer is important. If there are too many, the electrodeposited layer will not be sufficiently insoluble and the resultant film will be non uniform. On the other hand, if there are too few, the water solubility during neutralization will not be sufficient. Although the solvent for the polymer consists principally of water, it also may contain a hydrophilic polymerisation solvent for the polymer such as isopropanol, n butyl alcohol, t butyl alcohol, methyl Cellosolve, ethyl Cellosolve, isopropyl Cellosolve, butyl Cellosolve, diethylene glycol methyl ether, diethylene glycol ethyl ether, diacetone alcohol, etc. The type and quantity of hydrophilic solvent added also greatly affects the thickness and uniformity of the resultant electrodeposited film. When the electrodeposited film is to incorporate a coloured pigment, the charged pigment moves by electrophoresis together with the polymer and is taken up into the resultant film. In a transparent colour filter such as that of a matrix multi colour display device according to the present invention, the obscuring effect of the pigment is not required, and when the film is thin, its tinting strength is low. Accordingly, in the present invention a dye is preferably electrodeposited together with the polymer. To electrodeposit a dye with a polymer, it is necessary to charge the dye molecules to cause electrophoresis. With a water soluble dye, the dissociated dye ions provides an effect which is similar to that obtained by the addition of a support base, the result being an increase in the current and film thickness, and non uniformity of the film. Dyes which are barely soluble or are insoluble in water generally clump together in water, but since the electrodeposited polymer can be considered to be a kind of soap containing both hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups, it has the effect of dispersing the organic dye molecules to some extent. It has thus been found that when combined with a suitable dispersion solvent, the dye becomes fine particles which can be electrodeposited with the polymer. In this case, the rate of electrodeposition of the dye must be similar to that of the polymer, but this can be controlled by the solvent composition. Methods of producing matrix multi colour display devices according to the present invention will now be explained in detail with reference to the following Examples. Figures 3 and 4 illustrate an embodiment of a matrix multi colour display device according to the present invention. Figures 5 and 6 illustrate another embodiment of a matrix multi colour display device according to the present invention. As shown in Figure 7, a matrix multi colour display device according to the present invention was produced by connecting the transparent conductive layers 15 for electrodeposition to the source electrodes 12 instead of to the gate electrodes 7, and then applying the electrodeposition voltage to the source electrodes to produce a display device in which the lines of common source electrodes had the same colour, as in Example 2. Substantially the same effects as those of Example 2 were obtained. An electrodeposition bath having the composition set out below is prepared using the paint POWERMITE 3000 10 , a product of Nippon Paint having the following composition Electrodeposition bath The dispersion dyes used preferably do not contain any dispersant because commercially available dyes mostly contain anionic dispersants which change to ions in the electrodeposition bath and result in an increase in current. The electrodeposition bath is mixed by uniformly dispersing the dispersion dye in the ethylene glycol, within the range of X 1.5, and then adding the dispersion to an aqueous solution in which is dissolved the POWERMITE 3000 10. A matrix multi colour liquid crystal display device was produced by following the same procedures as in Example 1, and substantially the same effects as those of Example 1 were obtained. It was found, however, that dyes that produce light fast colour filters were limited to oil soluble, metal complex salt dyes. The composition of the electrodeposition bath in Example 1 was changed to the following composition In this case, the electrodeposition bath is mixed by adding the oil soluble dye to the S Via ED 3000, in the range of x 1.0, and this is uniformly dispersed by kneading, ultrasonic waves, etc. Then the water is added to form the electrodeposition bath. When a matrix multi colour display device was produced in the same way as in Example 1, the same effects as those of Example 1 were obtained. The oil soluble dyes used in this Example are not limited to those which are soluble in hydrophilic solvents, but, needless to say, are preferably very light fast. The above Examples describe methods of producing matrix multi colour display devices in accordance with the present invention, the methods being simple and easy, and colour filters can be produced without needing to provide special means for separating colours, such as resist printing. The colour filters are rigid and free from patterning discrepancies. When combined with display materials such as liquid crystal materials, the colour filters provide a high display quality and reliability. Moreover, any one of each of the drain, source and gate electrodes on the TFT substrate can be used as the electrode for the electrodeposition, the structure of the TFTs need not be changed drastically to effect the electrodeposition, and the colour filters can be formed by electrodeposition so as to be positioned on or beneath the display electrodes.
