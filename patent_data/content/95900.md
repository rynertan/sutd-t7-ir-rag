## Description
METHOD FOR SIMULTANEOUS MEASUREMENT OF THERMAL NEUTRON DECAY COMPONENTS This invention relates to in situ measurements of earth formations traversed by a well borehole. More particularly, the invention relates to the measurement of the thermal neutron decay time or neutron lifetime of earth formations in the vicinity of a wellbore and of the borehole itself. The observed decay rate of the thermal neutron population in the vicinity of a well borehole following a pulse or burst of high energy neutrons can be approximated by the sum of formation and borehole exponential terms plus a background term which can vary according to formation and borehole conditions. In typical field conditions the borehole component of the thermal neutron lifetime, or decay time, decays more rapidly than the formation component of thermal neutron lifetime. The primary parameter of interest is ZF the mean lifetime of thermal neutrons within the formation. Another parameter of interest is SB, the mean lifetime of thermal neutrons in the borehole. The present invention provides methods and apparatus for determining both of these parameters of interest simultaneously and in real time. The system and methods of the present invention employ a pulsed source of fast neutrons. The fast neutrons are slowed down or moderated to thermal energy rapidly by interaction with the nuclei of the elZ ts in the borehole, the earth formations surrounding the borehole, and fluids contained in the pore space of such formations. The thermal neutron lifetime or decay time of the earth formation is largely determined by the salt or chlorine content of the earth formations. The hydrogenous matter in the pore spaces and borehole rapidly attenuates or slows down the fast neutron flux emitted by a source of pulsed fast neutrons.The fast neutrons when slowed to thermal energy are said to be thermalized and then be captured by the nuclei of elements comprising the formation matrix and fluids filling the formation matrix and the materials comprising the wellbore, including the borehole fluid, logging instrument, and possibly well casing. The element chlorine, which is found in highly saline borehole fluids and earth formation fluids in the pore spaces of earth formations in the vicinity of a borehole and a high salt NaCl content is present, has a very high capture cross section for thermalized neutrons.Thus a measurement of the thermal neutron decay time or neutron lifetime of earth formations in the vicinity of a well borehole can be indicative of the amount of saline fluids present in the pore spaces of the formation. When combined with formation water salinity, porosity measurements and measurements of formation shaliness, this results in a combination which can be used to discriminate oil from salt water filled pore spaces in the vicinity of a well borehole. Two commercially available services for measuring the thermal neutron lifetime or thermal neutron decay time of earth formations in the vicinity of a well borehole are presently available. Both of these commercial techniques employ the assumption that the wellbore materials are of a significantly higher thermal neutron capture cross section than the surrounding earth formations. By making this assumption, then a neutron burst or pulse may be emitted from a well logging instrument situated in the borehole, and after a time delay which is sufficient to allow the thermal neutrons in the well borehole itself to all be substantially captured by the wellbore nuclei having a high capture cross section, the borehole decay time component may be ignored. Then measurements of the rate of decay of the thermal neutron population in the earth formations may be measured.These commercial neutron lifetime or thermal neutron decay time measurements have proven to be particularly valuable in evaluating the producing potential of earth formations in the vicinity of cased well boreholes. In both of these presently available commercial techniques, a well logging instrument which traverses the wellbore uses a pulsed source of high energy 14 Mev neutrons, usually produced in a deuteriumtritium accelerator tube. The first commercially available technique, at the present time is known as the fixed gate1 technique. In this technique, the neutron source is repetitively pulsed and for each neutron pulse a cloud of fast neutrons is injected in a generally spherically symmetric fashion about the source into the surrounding earth formations. The fast neutron cloud passes from the well tool through the drilling mud, wellbore casing, cement between the casing and the earth formation surrounding the wellbore and into the earth formations. In this technique, typically each such pulse of fast neutrons has approximately a constant intensity and lasts typically for a time duration of from 20 tp 50 microseconds.The number of thermal neutrons comprising this cloud or population then decays exponentially due to the capture of the thermalized neutrons by nuclei in the earth formations and borehole. After an initial time period following the neutron burst typically about 300 400 microseconds , during which the resultant capture gamma ray distribution in the borehole, mud and casing is assumed to be substantially dissipated, measurements of the number of thermalized neutrons in the vicinity of the well tool are made during two successive time intervals or gates, of fixed duration. These two measurements made during the constant time gates or successive time intervals can then be used to define an approximately exponential decay curve for the thermal neutron population in the earth formation surrounding the borehole. The assumption is made that enough time has passed following the neutron burst for essentially all thermalized neutrons in the vicinity of the wellbore itself to have been captured by the borehole elemental nuclei. The assumption is that the borehole component of the thermal neutron decay or thermal neutron lifetime is generally shorter than the earth formation component of thermal neutron decay or thermal neutron lifetime. This usually occurs when borehole drilling fluids having a high chlorine or salt water content are encountered. However, in boreholes containing air, gas, fresh water or oil this relationship does not always hold.Accordingly, one particular advantage of the present invention over this fixed gate prior art thermal neutron lifetime measuring technique is that no assumption is made as to the relative thermal neutron decay time characteristics of the borehole fluid with respect to the thermal neutron decay time or lifetime characteristics of the earth formations surrounding the borehole. The thermal neutron population in the formation in the vicinity of the borehole is inferentially measured during the two fixed time gating intervals following each neutron burst or pulse by measuring the capture gamma rays resulting from the capture of thermalized neutrons by the nuclei of materials comprising the earth formations and fluids in the pore spaces therein. The two time intervals or gates most frequently used, for example, in the fixed gate technique for measuring thermal neutron decay times can occur between 400 600 microseconds following the neutron burst and between 700 900 microseconds following the neutron burst. These valves are used in typical earth formations regardless of the salinity of the fluid present in the borehole. Since these fixed time gates are designed for general borehole use regardless of salinity they are not optimized as to maximizing count rate. Because the gates are delayed for a relatively long time after the burst, the count rate during the gates is lower than optimum in saline fluid filled boreholes. This can lead to statistical uncertainty in the measurement of S If neutron diffusion effects are ignored, the relationship for the decay of a thermal neutron population in a homogeneous medium having a thermal neutron macroscopic capture cross section z can be expressed as in Equation 1. N PNle t vt 1 wherein N1 is the number of thermal neutrons at a first point in time tl N2 is the number of thermal neutrons present at a later point in t2 e is the Naperian logarithm base t is the time between two measurements t2 t1 and v is the velocity of the thermal neutrons. The macroscopic thermal neutron capture cross section z of a reservoir rock which can be obtained from Equation 1 is dependent upon its porosity, matrix composition, shaliness, the formation water salinity, and the quantity and type of petroleum contained in the pore spaces therein. This quantity thus represents a valuable physical parameter or measurement of the formation to be obtained. The second presently commercially available prior art technique for measuring thermal neutron decay time or thermal neutron lifetime uses a reciprocal relationship of the macroscopic thermal neutron capture cross section z which is defined in terms of T the time constant for absorption of the thermal neutrons. A relationship analoagous to Equation 1 but defined inoterms of T is given by N N0et T 2 where T 1 us. In Equation 2 , N represents the thermal neutron density at any time t No is the thermal neutron density at an initial time, to e again represents theNaperian logarithm base constant and T is the time required for the thermal neutron population to decay to l e of its value at to. In measuring the thermal neutron decay time using the second prior art technique known as the sliding gate arrangement, the well logging instrument emits a pulse or burst of fast neutrons into the formation the duration of which is actually controlled and related to previously measured values of T of the earth formations. For example, the neutron pulse duration may be one T duration. Gamma ray detectors are used to obtain counts of capture gamma rays during two successive time intervals following the generation of the neutron cloud in the vicinity of the well borehole in order to define the exponential decay curve. In this technique, however, the two intervals used for measuring the gamma ray population to define the exponential decay curve are not fixed in duration or in starting time following the neutron burst.The value of T previously measured on the previous neutron burst cycle is used to establish the neutron burst duration for the generation of the fast neutrons as well as the waiting interval to the opening of the first time gate following the burst, the duration of the first time gate, the duration of the second time gate and the waiting interval between the initiation of the first and second time gates. All of these times are adjusted until a predetermined relationship to T is satisfied. For example, the second measurement gate duration may be two T in duration. A waiting interval of two T following the neutron burst maybe used before the opening of the first gate. The first gate may have a duration of one T. In both of the above described prior art systems for determining thermal neutron lifetime or decay time, the neutron source and one detector are all that is essential for the measurement. However, in both of the commercially available techniques, dual spaced detectors are employed and measurements at the detectors of the capture gamma radiation due to thermal neutrons are used to generate approximations or measurements of the porosity of the earth formations in the vicinity of the borehole. The system of the present invention also employs two detectors and can make porosity measurements. As previously , à of the commercially available techniques for measuring thermal neutron decay time at present employ the assumption that the borehole thermal neutron decay time is substantally less than unit of the earth formations in the vicintly of the borehole and may thus be discriminated against by timing out the borehole component.In sliding gate techniques at a time intervals substantially following both of the detection gates used for T or 2 measurements a background time gate can be used to measure the background of gamma radiation due to thermal neutron capture events ir. the borehole ard earth forma tions surrounding the wellbore.These background runts area after appropriate normalization, generally substracted from the counts made during the two measurement gates in such a system so as to remove the influence of natural gamma ray background which occurs n the vicintiy of the well borehole and any background which may be induced within tt.le real detectors and formation by the neutron source. It should be noted that both of the previously described commercial well logging systems do not use all of the possibly available gamma ray count information following each burst of neutrons.The time intervals during which the detectors are not gated to accept information are lost in both these prior art systems. Thus, the full utilization of the neutron output from the neutron generator is not made in the prior art schemes. Similarly, both of the prior art techniques assumes that the formation thermal neutron lifetime or thermal neutron decay time may be essentially completely separated from that of the borehole component by time gating. Even under ideal conditions, this assumption is not completely valid. The present invention utilizes techniques and systems which avoid each of these prior art assumptions and limitations. According to the invention, there is provided a method for simultaneously measuring the borehole and formation components of thermal neutron decay time of a borehole and earth formations in the vicinity of the borehole, comprising the steps of repetitively emitting, in a well borehole, relatively short duration pulses of fast neutrons which are rapidly moderated by interaction with nuclei of materials in the borehole and surrounding earth formations and slowed down to thermal energy, creating repetitive bursts of thermal neutron population in the borehole and surrounding earth formations detecting in the borehole during a time interval between said repetitive pulses of fast neutrons, radiations representative of the thermal neutron population in the borehole and surrounding earth formations in at least four time subintervals subsequent to a pulse of fast neutrons and generating at least four count rate signals representative of said thermal neutron populations during said at least four time subintervals combining, preferably by an iterative technique, said at least four count rate signals according to a predetermined relationship in which exponential relationships are assumed to exist for a borehole and a formation component of thermal neutron decay time to simultaneously obtain two measurement signals representative of the borehole component and the formation component of thermal neutron decay time and recording said measurement signal as a function of borehole depth. In one embodiment of the present invention, a well logging tool is moved through the borehole and includes a pulsed source of fast neutrons and two radiation detectors The neutron source generates a pulse of fast neutrons of approximately constant intensity for a duration of between 10 and 30 microseconds. These neutrons are introduced into the media comprising the well borehole and surrounding formations and result in a thermal neutron population being generated from the slowing down of the fast neutrons in the earth formation media and the borehole.After a very short pause to allow moderation of the fast neutrons following the neutron pulse, the detectors are gated on and the capture gamma radiation resulting from the capture of thermal neutrons in the borehole and earth formations in the vicinity of the borehole are recorded essentially continuously until the next neutron burst is about to begin.During multiple time gates which occur during this essentially continuous interval, the capture gamma ray counting rate is observed in six or more essentially contiguous time gates. The multiple time gate measurements of the counting rates are supplied to a thermal neutron lifetime computer which computes the formation and borehole neutron lifetime components by means of least squares fitting of this count rate data taken during six, or more, essentially contiguous time gates following each neutron burst. The thermal neutron lifetime computer is enabled to calculate both the borehole thermal neutron lifetime component and the earth formation thermal neutron lifetime component, simultaneously.Approximately once per second, and for approximately five percent of the one second operating cycle, the neutron source is turned off and the detectors are used to establish any relatively long lived background counting rate due to source neutron induced gamma ray activity within the gamma ray detector, the formation, borehole, logging sonde, or natural gamma radiation in the vicinity of the borehole. This background gamma ray information is then properly normalized and subtracted from the six or more time gate measurements of thermal neutron capture gamma rays made following each neutron burst. Electronic systems are provided in the downhole tool and at the surface for producing the measurement sequence and neutron pulses as described. Additionally, synchronization or sync pulses are also generated to provide a means for separating the counts of gamma rays representative of thermal neutron capture during each of the six or more gating portions of the measurement cycle, as previously described.Moreover, a surface computer and processing technique therefor for deriving the thermal neutron decay times, or lifetimes, of the borehole component and earth formation components is provided and is attached to a well logging recorder in which a record medium may be moved as a function of borehole depth, while the logging instrument is moved through the borehole. The formation and borehole components of thermal neutron lifetime may be plotted as a function of borehole depth on this recorder. Thus, the system of the present invention includes techniques for determining the value of thermal neutron decay time or macroscopic thermal neutron capture cross section of the borehole and the surrounding media simultaneously. The invention is best understood by reference to the following detailed description thereof when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a schematic drawing showing a well logging system in accordance with the present invention. Figure 2 is a schematic block diagram depicting the electronic systems of the well logging system of the present invention.

Figure 5 is a graphical relationship illustrating the composite thermal neutron population decay curve and time gates according to a second embodiment of the present invention. Figure 6 is a schematic representation of a telemetry sequence as a function of time for the gating arrangement of Figure 5. Figures 7a, b, and c and Figure 8 are flow chart diagrams illustrating embodiments of one method for obtaining parameters of interest of earth formations by a surface computer at both near and far detectors. The previously discussed prior art techniques for determining thermal neutron lifetime or decay time can encounter two major problems. These two major problems are 1 Under certain formation and borehole conditions, the borehole component has not decayed to a negligible level prior to the beginning of the gating of detectors sequence for determining the neutron lifetime. This results in a erroneous measurement of TF, and 2 The statistical accuracy of TF is sometimes quite poor because the decay rate samples have to be taken at relatively long intervals of time after the neutron burst in order to minimize the effects of the borehole component. A third problem in prior art neutron lifetime loggingtechniques was first discussed by Mills, et al in a paper entitled Pulsed Neutron Experiments in a Borehole Model ,Mills, et al in Nuclear Science and Engineering, Vol. 21,Pages 346 356 1965 . The Mills, et al paper shows that even if TF is computed from count rate data taken at time delays sufficient for the borehole component to decay to a negligible level, that the computed 7F is still a function of TB, the lifetime of thermal neutrons within the borehole. This may be thought of as being due to thermalized neutrons continuously diffusing back into the borehole from the formation even after the original borehole thermal neutron population has decayed by capture to a low level. Thus, the two prior art techniques completely dismiss the effect caused by this third problem. The present invention however takes into account the problems of all three effects and results in a much more reliable measurement of the thermal neutron lifetime or decay time than heretobefore has been available. In order to obtain accurate hydrocarbon saturations from pulsed neutron lifetime or decay time logs. The following three criteria should be met Cl TF, the observed lifetime of the formation component should be computed from count rate data which contains no contributions from neutron capture within the borehole 2 TF should be statistically as accurate as possible and 3 The intrinsic mean lifetime of the formation component Fi should be determined before hydrocarbon saturation calculations are made. According to the previously mentioned Mills, et al paper, the measured lifetime can be related to TFi, the intrinsic.lifetime only if TB is known. It is therefore, desirable to measure both the formation component T F and the borehole component TB of the thermal neutron lifetime or decay time simultaneously for maximum accuracy. As previously discussed, the observed decay rate of the thermal neutron population in the vicinity of a well borehole following a burst of high energy neutrons may be described as the sum of a formation component, a borehole component and a background component. This may be expressed mathematically as in Equation 3. c t PABIt fg Apt TF CB 3 In Equation 3, C t is the counting rate at any time t measured from a reference time. AB and IF are constants which may be interpreted according to Fig. 3 of the drawings with Ag representing the initial borehole component at the reference time O, and IF representing the initial formation component at the reference time o. These components are shown inFig. 3 as intercepts on the ordinate axis as a function of time. TB in Equation 3 represents the borehole component of composite lifetime of thermal neutrons. TB may be though of as the slope of the borehole component curve of Fig. 3.Similarly, Tp represents the formation lifetime component of the composite neutron lifetime and may be thought of as the slope of the formation component curve of Fig. 3. Similarly, TF represents the formation lifetime component of the composite neutron lifetime and may be thought of as the slope of the formation component curve of Fig. 3. Finally,CB represents the component of the count rate due to the long lived radiation such as tool case and detector activation and the like and may be thought of as a constant component as shown by the horizontal line labelled background in Fig. 3. The composite thermal neutron decay curve shown in Fig. 3 is the resultant or summation of the borehole component, formation component and background component curves illustrated therein. In the technique of the present invention, the background component CB is measured during a separate portion of the operating cycle as illustrated in Fig. 4. Referring now to Fig. 4, a telemetry stream from a downhole instrument which will be described in more detail subsequently is shown as a function of time. A synchronization pulse begins each operating cycle of the downhole instrumentation. This synchronization pulse is followed immediately by a neutron burst of approximately Eonstant intensity and having a duration which will be described in more detail subsequently.Six or more time gating intervals follow each neutron burst during which count rate measurements at a detector spaced from the source are made and transmitted to the surface.The multiple time gating intervals are essentially contiguous and last for a total of approximately 1 millisecond following the synchronization pulse. This repetitive operating cycle is repeated approximately 1000 times during a one second interval. At the end of a 945 millisecond interval, a background gate shown in Fig. 4 is used to count background radiation corresponding to CB in Fig. 3. During this 55,000 microseconds or 55 milliseconds interval, the neutron generator is not pulsed. Therefore, the measurements made during this time interval, after approximately 5 milliseconds to allow thermal capture radiation following the last sequential neutron burst to develop to a negligible level, will contain only count information due to radiation attributable to background.This background count information is telemetered to the surface by the downhole system and processed as will be described in more detail subsequently. When the background counting rate CB is measured in the manner described and telemetered to the surface, it may be subtracted from the composite counting rate C t ofEquation 3 to obtain a net counting rate C t as given inEquation 4. C t Ctt CB IF t tB A t ZF 4 In Equation 4, the symbols are all as previously defined. In the method of the present invention, as illustrated with respect to Figures 3 and 4, six or more counting rates measured in the six time gates following the neutron burst and labelled T1, T2 T3, T4, T5, and T6 are combined by an iterative least squares fitting technique. The counting rate measurements in the six time gates may be fitted in real time in a surface computer, for example, in order to obtain the parameters of interest in Equations 3 and 4.The fitting procedure yields TF, TB, IF and IF as previously defined. It will be observed that the six or more approximately contiguous time gating intervals illustrated inFigure 3, have negligible or minimal time delay between each gate. Therefore, the full counting rate information following a short moderation time interval from the end of the neutron burst to the opening of the first time gate which moderation time is typically of the order of 20 30 microseconds is utilized in the method of the present invention.No count information is lost due to waiting for a borehole component to decay. Additionally, since this technique simultaneously determines TF and TB, the criterion of theMills, et al paper previously referenced is met. Referring now to Figures 5 and 6, an alternative time gating scheme which employs the techniques of the present invention is illustrated schematically. In Figure 5, a neutron burst of 15 to 20 microseconds duration is shown, a 20 30 microsecond moderation time interval follows the burst and then a time gate labelled gate 1 is opened for a relatively short duration of time. A slightly wider or longer duration time gate 2 is used. Subsequent time gates 3, 4, 5 and 6 are each of longer duration than their predecessor in the time gating sequence. The aim of this time gating scheme is to statistically optimize the counting rates in each of the gates. As the composite thermal neutron population decay curve falls off, the successively wider time gates allow more counts to occur at the lower counting rate of the later time gates. The actual times contemplated for time gating schemes shown in Figures 3 and 5 are given in Tables 1 and 2 which follows In Tables 1 and 2 all times are measured with respect to the reference time O at the beginning of the neutron burst .

The slight time lapses 5 sec. between the time gates of Table 1 are supplied to account for time necessary to shift the contents of a counter into a memory buffer in the downhole tool electronics to be described subsequently. Similarly short intervals would be required for the time gates of Table 2 but are omitted from the table for simplicity. It will be understood that it is meant to have the time gates of Tables 1 and 2 as nearly contiguous in time as is possible within the timing limitations of the electronics. Figure 6 illustrates a telemetry stream resulting from the time gating arrangement illustrated in Figure 5. A synchronization pulse is sent to the surface by the downhole electronics. This is followed by the neutron burst and the reference time begins at the ending of the neutron burst. The short 10 30 microsecond moderation time interval elapses and then a digital number representing the count rates made in time gate 1, labelled G1 in Figure 6, are telemetered to the surface. Similarly, digital numbers representing the counts in gates 2 6. This sequence is followed for 945 milliseconds. Then the background gating interval of 50 milliseconds is initiated as illustrated previously with respect to Figure 4. In either event, the counting rates C ti i l 6 are tele metered to the surface where they are employed in a surface computer to be described in more detail subsequently to employ an iterative a least square fitting technique for extracting the parameters of interest. Since Equation 4 is non linear it is necessary to use an iterative fitting procedure for the least squares fit. A particular fitting procedure is illustrated subsequently and will be described in more detail with respect to Figures 7a, b and c and Figure 8. It will suffice to say, however, at this point that the parameters of interest are, obtained from the surface computer by a least square iterative fitting pro cedure. The values of TF, TB, A, and B may then be recorded as a function of borehole depth in a conventional manner. Referring now to Figure 1, a well logging system in accordance with the concepts of the present invention is illustrated schematically. A well borehole 10 is filled with ,a borehole fluid 11 and penetrates earth formations 20 to be investigated. A downhole well logging sonde 12 is suspended in the borehole 10 via a conventional armored logging cable 13, in a manner known in the art, such that the sonde 12 maybe raised and lowered through the borehole as desired. The well logging cable 13 passes over a sheave wheel 14 at the surface. The sheave wheel 14 is electrically or mechani cally coupled, as indicated by dotted line 15, to a well logging recorder 18 which may comprise an optical recorder, or magnetic tape, or both, as known in the art. The record of measurements made by the downhole sonde 12, may thus be recorded as a function of the depth in the borehole of the sonde 12. In the downhole sonde 12, a neutron generator 21 is supplied with high voltage approximately 100 kilovolts for its operation by a high voltage power supply 22. Control and telemetry electronics 25 are utilized to supply control signals to the high voltage supply and the neutron generator 21 and to telemeter information measured by the downhole instrument to the surface via the logging cable 13. Longitudinally spaced from the neutron generator 21 are two radiation detectors 23 and 24. Radiations detectors 23 and 24 may comprise, for example, thallium activated sodium iodide crystals which are optically coupled to photomultiplier tubes. The detectors 23 and 24 serve to detect gamma radia tion produced in the surrounding formations 20 resulting from the action of the neutron generator 21 in emitting neutrons. A A neutron shiclding material 28 having a high density matter content or large scattering cross section is interposed between the neutron generator 21 and the dual spaced detectors 23 and 24, in order to prevent direct irradiation of the detectors by neutrons emitted by the neutron generator 21. Shielding 29 may also be interposed between the detectors 23 and 24 if desired. Upon activation of the neutron generator 21, a burst, or pulse, of neutrons of approximately 10 30 microseconds duration is initiated and is emitted into the well borehole 10, borehole fluid 11 and through the.steel casing 26 and cement layer 27 surrounding the steel casing into earth formations 20 being investigated. The neutron burst is moderated or slowed down by scattering interactions such that the neutrons, are all essentially at thermal energy. The thermalized or thermal neutrons then begin capture interactions with the elemental nuclei of constituents of the earth formations 20 and pore spaces contained therein. The capture of neutrons by nuclei of elements comprising the earth formations 20 and their pore spaces produce capture gamma rays which are emitted and impinge upon detectors 23 and 24. A voltage pulse is produced from the photomultipliers of detectors 23 and 24 for each gamma ray so detected. These voltage pulses are supplied to the electronics section 25, counted in a digital cunter, and are telemetered to the surface via a conductor 16 of the well logging cable 13. At the surface, a surface electronics package 17 detects the telemetered information from the downhole sonde 12 and per forms the least squares fitting technique to determine the TFt T, A and B with respect to the earth formations 20 be ing investigated. The surface electronics then supplies signals representative of the measured quantities to the recorder 18 where they are recorded as d unction of borehole depth. Referring now to Figure 2, a schematic block diagram illustrating the electronic porticns oE the subsurface and surface electronics systems are illustrated n more detail but still schematically Bower for operation of the subsurface electronics is supplied via a conductor of the well logging cable 32 to a conventional low voltage power supply 31 and a high voltage power supply 34. The high voltage power supply 34 may be of the Cockcroft Walton multiple stage type and supplies approximately, 100 kilovolts for the operation of the. neutron generator tube 33. The neutron generator tube 33 is of the deuterium tritium accelerator type. An ion source 36 which is maintained at a potential near ground is used to generate deuterium ions from deuterium gas filling the envelope of tube 33.A replenisher heater 37 is impregnated with additional deuterium and maintains a pressure level of deuterium gas inside the tube 33 envelope sufficient to supply ion source 36 with deuterium gas for ionization.A target 35 is impregnated with tritum and is maintained at a relatively high negative 100 kilovolts potential. The ion source is controlled by an ion source pulser 41. When supplied with a relatively low level voltage pulse, the ion source causes gas in the tube 33 envelope to become ionized and accelereated toward the target material 35. Upon impinging on the target material of target 35, the deuterium ions interact thermonuclearly with the tritium ions in the target to produce neutrons, which then are emitted in a generally spherically symmetrical fashion from the neutron generator tube 33 into the borehole and surrounding earth formations. A replenisher control circuit 39 is supplied with samples of the neutron generator target current by a sampling circuit 38 and utilizes this to compare with a reference signal to control the replenisher current and thereby the gas pressure in the envelope of the neutron generator tube 33. Timing circuits 42 which comprise a master timing oscillator operating at a relatively high frequency and an appropriate divider chain, supplies 1 kilo hertz pulses to the ion source pulser 41, and also supplies one second clock pulses to the neutron generator start up control circuit 40. Moreover, timing circuit 42 supplies 2 megahertz clock pulses to a microprocessor and data storage array 44 and supplies timing pulses to the background circuit 45 and counters 52 and 53.Similarly, timing signals are supplied to a pair of gain control circuits 48 and 49. During the background portion of the detection cycle the background circuit 45 is supplied with counts from the counters 52 and 53. This circuit also provides a disable pulse to the ion source 41 to prevent pulsing of the neutron generator during the background counting portion of the cycle. The background correction circuit 45 supplies background count information to microprocessor and data storage 44. Background may be stored and averaged for longer periods than capture data since at low discriminator threshold, most gamma ray background is from neutron NaI, activation of the detector crystal which has 27 minutes half life. Better statistics in subtracted signal results. The digital count information from counters 52 and 53 and background correction circuit 45 are supplied to the microprocessor and data storage circuit 44. These circuits 44 format the data and present it in a serial manner to the telemetry circuit 43 which is used to telemeter the digital information from the counters and background correction circuit to the surface via well logging cable 32. At the surface, a telemetry interface unit 54 detects the analog telemetry voltage signals from the logging cable 32 conductors and supplies them to a telemetry processing unit 55 which formats the digital count rate information representing the counting rate from counters 52 and 53 in the subsurface equipment in terms of the time gating schemes as previously discussed.The digital numbers representative of the count rates in each of the six or more time gates and the background counting rate are then supplied to a digital computer 56. The computer 56 is programmed in accordance with the flow chart of Figures 7a, 7b and 7c and Figure 8 to interpret the six or more time gates and background counting rate information in terms of the thermal neutron decay time or thermal neutron lifetime of the borehole and formation components. Output signals representing formation parameters of interest are supplied from the computer 56 to a film recorder 57 and a magnetic tape recorder 58 for recording as a function of borehole depth.The surface computer 56 is programmed in accordance with the flow charts illus trated in Figure 7a, 7b, 7c and Figure 8 to extract the earth formation and borehole components of thermal neutron decay time TF and TB and the intercepts d and AF f Figure 3 which represent the counting rates at the end of the neutron burst due to the formation and borehole components of themeral neutron population respectively.In order to accomplish this an iterative least squares fitting scheme is utilized. The above referenced iterative scheme for determining the borehole and earth formation decay times is described with more particularity with respect to Figures 7a, 7b, 7c ,and 8. Figure 7a, 7b and 7c describes the processing for obtaining this information based on the count rates in the time gates in the near detector, while the flow diagram ofFigure 8 refers to the determination based on the count rates in the corresponding gates for the far detector from the neutron source. It should be mentioned that the exact number of gates used in this scheme is, not absolutely crucial as long as it is at least four or greater. The system is designed to work optimally with six gates plus a background gate. However, the time widths of the gates may also be variable. Thus the gating schemes illustrated in both Figures 3 and 5 are susceptible to processing by this technique. Before discussing the processing of Figures 7 and 8 with respect to the flow charts shown therein, a few words about the general philosophy of this processing scheme are in order. As previously described, data is accumulated in each of the six time gates at each of the dual detectors for approximately one second intervals and transmitted to the surface from the downhole instrument once per one second interval. In addition, a background count is made at each detector for the period indicated previously approximSately once per second and this is also transmitted to the surface computer for processing on a once per second basis.Borehole information is carried forward from the processing of one data set to the next data set in order to speed up convergence of the formation and borehole T measurements.The previous borehole component is subtracted from the new, or just measured data, since borehole conditions are slowly or infrequently varying such as the salinity size and casing weight in cased holes. The carrying forward and subtraction of the borehole data has the effect of improving the first formation parameter calculations on a given data set by carrying forward slowing changing parameters from earlier data sets. This feature coupled with convergence checks and failure options which will be described in more detail with respect to Figures 7 and 8 assure accurate measurements of all parameters even under changing borehole conditions. Because the gate midpoint adjusting formula depends on a value of T, it is necessary to use two formulae, one which depends on TB and the other which depends on TF.Furthermore, since the counting rate is the sum of two independent exponential terms, it is desirable to keep any borehole or formation count rate computations as independent as possible. Therefore, two complete sets of gate midpoints, GT and GBT, are employed and adjusted. The processing of each new set of data is begun with a two gate formation decay time Tp measurement which uses gates remote from the neutron burst. This minimizes the effect of any inaccuracies in borehole data carried forward from previous data sets. These gates, which are remote from the neutron burst, may be up to 250 microseconds duration. This may significantly effect the midpoint of the gate timewise shifts, if the TF changes significantly. Hence convergence and default options are desirable to insure that convergence will continue across a formation interval change. Subsequent formation decay time or T iterations use additional borehole affected gates to improve these statistics, but, only after more accurate borehole subtraction parameters are determined in the processing. Final decay time T and amplitude A determinations made from the processing are insured to be reasonable by a sequence of convergence checks. A primary check is made to insure that the observed counts in a gate reasonably remote from the burst are within a given tolerance of the calculated formation counts. If this or other convergence checks fail, formation and borehole data from the previous data set is output. In allinstances, where failure is detected the next data set uses no carry forward parameters and begins with a two gate TF measurement using gates where both midpoint shifts of the gates timewise and borehole dependence are minimized. The required midpoint shifts for both the borehole and formation T for all gates whenever convergence is achieved in any data set are carried forward. This assures more accurate results when operating on the next data set. Moreover, a check is made on the statistical significance of the borehole counting rates and hence the IF and TB which result from such count rates. If the borehole counts are not a reasonable factor larger than statistical errors calculated for the time gates 1 and 2 in which the borehole parameters are calculated, then the borehole counts are ignored in the formation affected time gates and the system outputs nonborehole corrected estimates of TF and AF. If this is not done, then large errors in borehole corrections to counts in remote gates can occur. Hence, erroneous formation parameters could be calculated. Referring now to Figures 7a, b and c, the processing of the measured count rate data in the near detector will be discussed in more detail. The discussion will be in terms of the flow chart of the processing program used in the computer 56 of Fig. 2 which has previously been described generally. Entry is made to the processing program at Block 60 ofFigure 7a. Current gate time GT and gate borehole time GBT midpoint arrays for each of the six time gates and the background time gate together with previously computed TF Apr TBr IF from the previous data set and the gate count rates C 1 through C 6 are input to the program. Control is then passed to logic block 61. At logic block 61 a test is performed to determine if this is the first data set of a well logging run or if there has been a failure at a previous depth or if no borehole counts were made at a previous depth. These options will be explained subsequently in more detail. If either of these three tests fail, then control passes to logic block 63 and the gate time and gate background time arrays are reinitialized to the values of previous data set o in the case of the first data set to their initial values.Control is then passed to logic block 65 where a test is performed to indicated whether the borehole component counting rate ratio D 4 D 5 is less than some arbitrary value i.e. 10 10 . This test indicates whether a significant borehole count rates exists in gates 4 and 5. If this condition occurs control is passed to the fail section which is discussed in more detail in Figure 7c.Such a failure would indicate that too large a borehole component exists in time gates which are placed relatively far from the end of the neutron burst indicating some unusual borehole condition. If the test at block 65 passes, control is transferred to logic block 67 where a new formation decay time TF is computed using the midpoint times of gates 4 and 5 and countsD 4 and D 5 . Control is then passed to logic block 68. Returning to logic block 61, if the test there does not fail, no abnormal conditions are indicated, and control is passed to logic block 62. At logic block 62, using the latest borehole. decay time parameter TB and amplitude IF and the borehole component time gate center point GBT.The borehole component of count rate is subtracted from the count rates in gates D 5 D 6 control is then transferred to logic block 64. At logic block 64 a test is performed to determine the relative magnitude of the borehole corrected count rates in gates 5 and 6. If the ratio of the count rate in gate 5 to 6 corrected for borehole counts is less than some arbitrary parameter, control is transferred to the fail section to be discussed with respect to Fig. 7c.This would indicate that not enough formation counts existed in gates 5 and 6 to accurately compute an initial estimate for iteration purposes of the formation decay time TF. If the test at block 64 passes, control is transferred to logic block 66. At logic block 66 a new formation decay time T F is computed from the two points of count rate data contained in gates 5 and 6 and the gate midpoints of these gates. Control is then transferred to logic block 68. At logic block 68 the formation decay time just computed in either logic block 66 or 67 is bound limited by testing it to determine if it is below some arbitrary value or above some arbitrary value. If it exceeds the arbitrary values selected, it is simply set to these arbitrary bounding values and control is transferred to logic block 69. At logic block 69 a formation amplitude component Ar is computed using the gate midpoint GT 5 and count D 5 . Control is then transferred to logic block 70. At logic block 70 a new gate time midpoint array for each of the six time gates and the background timegate is computed and control is passed to logic block 71. At logic block 71, the formation component counts appearing in the count rate of gates 1 and 2 are subtracted using the just computed values of TFl Ar and the gate midpoint time array. Control is then transferred to logic block 72. At logic block 72, a test is performed to determine if the borehole counts in gates 1 and 2 are greater than 4 percent on arbitrary parameter of the total counts in gates 1 and 2. This would normally be the case. If it is not the case, control is transferred to logic block 73 where a flag is set to indicate an extremely rapid borehole thermal neutron decay time. Control is then transferred to logic block 74. At logic block 74 a value of borehole component decay time TB is computed using the gate midpoint GBT 1 and GBT 2 and counts D l and D 2 . Control is then trans ferred to logic block 75. At logic block 75, a test is performed to determine if the just computed borehole component decay time TB is greater than the computed formation component decay time Tpi or if the formation component decay time TB exceeds 95 or is less than 30 microseconds arbitrary values . If either of these tests pass, then control is transferred to the fail section to be discussed in more detail with respect to Figure 7c. If not, normal conditions are indicated and control is transferred to logic block 76. At logic block 76, a new borehole amplitude component IF is computed using the midpoint of timegate 1 GBT l and the count rate D 1 . Control is then transferred to logic block 77. At logic block 77, a test is performed to determine if the borehole counts in gate exceed 25 percent arbitrary value of the total counts in that gate. If they do, this indicates that some unusual borehole condition exists and control is transferred to the fail section to be discussed subsequently. If not, conditions are normal and control is transferred to logic block 78. At logic block 78, a test is made to determine if the counter indicator K is equal to two. If so, this indicates two iterations have been completed through this portion of the program and control is transferred to logic block 82.If not, only one iteration has been made and control is transferred to logic block 79. At logic block 79, control counter R is set equal two and new gate time midpoint array GBT is computed. Control is then transferred to logic block 80. At logic block 80, count rate data D l through D 6 are updated by subtracting borehole component counts from the count rate data from the downhole instrument C 1 through C 6 , using the just computed borehole amplitude component IF and gate time array GET. Control is then transferred to logic block 81. At logic block 81, the least squares fit is performed as previously discussed to compute a formation decay time TF and formation amplitude component AF. Control is then transferred back to logic block 70 where the second iteration is followed through to compute an improved estimate of the borehole components as previously discussed. Referring now to logic block 82, when the iterative procedure previously described in Fig. 7b is completed, as indicated by the test on counter K at logic block 78, the borehole and formation parameters Ap, , d , TF and TB have been computed. Along with this, gate midpoint times are computed and these arrays are saved for the next pass through the processing scheme for the near detector. Control is then transferred to logic block 83. A convergence test is performed at block 83 to deter mine if these parameter d AFI TF, TB and the gate mid point time arrays are reasonable by comparing these with a percentage of the count rate from the downhole tool in the fifth timegate. If this test fails control is transferred to the fail section. If the test passes then reasonable values for the near detector have been computed and control is returned to the control program for processing of the far spaced detector count rate data. Referring now to Figure 7c the fail section is entered from any of the previously discussed points at which some failure is indicated. In this case control is transferred to logic block 85 where all uncalculable parameters are set to their value at the previous depth. These reset values are then returned to the main control program at logic block 86 for use in the next processing period.When the near detector processing is completed at logic block 84, control is normally transferred to logic block 87 for processing of the far spaced detector count rate depth. The processing of the far spaced detector data is similar to that of the processing of the near spaced detector data but maybe more readily appreciated by reference to Figure 8. At logic block 87 of Figure 8, current gate midpoint arrays and formation decay time and amplitude and borehole decay and amplitude information together with the just measured count rates C l through C 6 are entered through the main control program to the processing program.Control is then transferred to logic block 88. A test is performed at logic block 88 to determine if a near spaced formation decay time Tp was just computed.If not, control is transferred to logic block 92 where a formation TF for the far detector is computed using the count rates C 4 and C 5 together with gate midpointsGT 4 and GT 5 . Control is then transferred to logic block 93 where upper and lower bound test are performed on the just computed formation decay time TF and limiting of this value is accomplished. Control is then transferred to logic block 90. If the test at logic block 88 passes successfully control is transferred to logic 89 where a different approximation is used to compute a far detector formation decay time TF.This is an empirical formula relating TF far spaced to T near spaced which was derived by observing the relationship between near and far spaced EF over a wide range of borehole sizes, borehole salinities, and porosities. Control is then transferred to logic block 90. At logic block 90, the just computed formation decay time TF and the count rate in gate 5, C 5 is used to compute the formation amplitude component AF. Control is then transferred to logic block 91. At logic block 91, the formation count rates are subtracted from the count rates in gates 1 and 2, C l and C 2 to give corrected count rates D 1 and D 2 . Control is then transferred to logic block 94. At logic block 94, a test is performed to determine if the formation component is excessive in the two near burst gates. If this test indicates that no excessive formation component is present in these near gates, control is transferred to logic block 98 where the least squares fit of counts C 3 through C 6 are used to obtain a formation decay TF and amplitude AF. If the test at logic block 94 fails, control is transferred to logic block 95. At logic block 95, a line is fitted through borehole counts Dtl and D 2 to compute a value of the borehole decay time TB and the borehole component amplitude AB. Control is then transferred to logic block 96. At logic block 96, a test is performed to determine if the borehole decay time TB is between 30 and 100 microseconds arbitrary values . A normal value in a saline borehole. If this condition exists, then the borehole count rate just calculated is subtracted from the count rates in gates C 3 through C 6 using the just computed borehole component decay time and amplitude components, and the least squares fit of counts C 3 through C 6 is performed to compute TF and At. . These computed values are passed back to the main program.If the borehole component decay time as indicated by the test at logic block 96 does not fall within the reasonable range, then control is transferred to logic block 99 where control is returned to the main program controlling the computer and the Ip, TB, IF and IF either calculated or best previous are returned for further use in the next processing cycle. In the foregoing manner, it is thus seen that optimum use of the count rate information from previous measurement cycles are used to achieve more accurate borehole and formation parameters by achieving accurate early guesses of slowly varying parameters. When sudden variations occur, tests are always performed to assure that the process is converging and is producing reasonable values for both the formation and borehole components which are sought to be measured with the system of the invention. Using the processing scheme just arrived it has been found possible to compute both formation and borehole components in real time during the measurement process. Thus, the advantages previously described of the neutron lifetime or decay time logging system of the present invention may be realized in an optimum manner. While the foregoing descriptions may make other alternative embodiments of the invention apparent to those skilled in the art, the subject invention is defined by the appended claims. It is the aim of these claims to cover all such changes and modifications which may be within the true spirit and scope of the invention.
