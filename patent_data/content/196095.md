## Abstract
A magnetic recording and or reproducing apparatus is disclosed, comprising a rotary head device 9 , in which a magnetic tape 2 is drawn out of a cassette 1 and brought into contact with the rotary head device 9 or the like. A tape draw out device 3, 4 doubling as a tape guide forms a predetermined tape path and guides the drive of the magnetic tape after drawing out the magnetic tape. The apparatus further requires a fixed magne tic head 11 and other tape guide mechanism 5a which are movably arranged on the path of the tape draw out device during the apparatus operation for reducing the size thereof. With the tape loading operation, the fixed magnetic head and the other tape guide are moved by a common drive mechanism 27, 28, 29, 31 and held in position by a common stopper 21 .
