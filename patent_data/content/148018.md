# Solenoid controlled fluid flow valve.

## Abstract
A remotely controllable fluid valve includes a solenoid armature arrangement which functions as an electromagnetic spring having improved force displacement characteristics over a mechanical spring. The solenoid magnetizes a pair of axially spaced, sleevelike field poles. The armature is so shaped and initially positioned relative to the field poles that as the armature, supported in one pole, moves further into the other pole, the axial magnetic force thereon decreases at a decreasing rate with the rate of decrease being greater at higher levels of solenoid energization. In one embodiment, the flow valve is pressure compensated and controls a larger flow valve. The valve seat is formed on a member separate from the housing which also slidingly supports the valve member. The surfaces supporting sliding members are electroless nickel coated to reduce friction.

## Description
SOLENOID CONTROLLED FLUID FLOW VALVE Specification This invention pertains to the art of fluid valves and more particularly to a fluid valve employing a remotelycontrollable, electro magnetic spring for adjusting the opening pressure or volume flow through the valve. The invention is particularly applicable to pilot type, proportional flow or normally open pressure relief valves, or where one of such valves is used to control a larger valve and will be described with particular reference thereto, although it will be appreciated that the invention is equally applicable to other types of spring controlled valves, either for gases or liquids and where the pressure or flow forces will not exceed the limited magnetic forces which can be developed in a solenoid having the characteristics of an electro magnetic spring. Background Pilot type pressure control valves are extensively used for controlling the pressure at which a larger control valve will open to relieve or control the pressure in a hydraulic system. Normally, such pilot valves are comprised of a valve element having a surface or surfaces exposed to the hydraulic pressure to be controlled which pressure creates a pressure force tending to open the valve. A compression spring biases the valve element to the closed position.When the pressure force exceeds the spring force or bias, the valve opens to allow the flow of fluid therethrough.This fluid flow then changes pressure forces on the larger valve allowing it to open and prevent further increases in the fluid pressure. To determine the opening pressure. the amount of spring compression or bias force on the valve element is initially adjusted at the time of manufacture or is controlled in the field by means of a threaded member which is rotated either manually or by an electric motor. The use of springs to determine the opening pressure of the valve presents three problems. First, manual adjustment prevents remote control and electric motor adjustment is expensive, bulky, relatively slow to react and require relatively l arge amounts of pulsed electrical power. Computer control of such valves in industrial processes is difficult. Secondly, springs inherently give to the valve a rising pressure versus flow characteristic. Thus, as the valve opens to permit flow, the spring is compressed. As the spring is compressed, its bias force increases in direct proportion to the amount of compression. A progressively higher fluid force or fluid pressure is required to open the valve further and further. For example, with a spring having a force versus compression rate here in after called spring rate of 5.31 kilograms per cm, to fully open a pressure control valve 0.508 mm, requires an increase in force of 0.272 kilograms. With a 0.762 mm diameter valve seat1 this calculates to a pressure increase of 2.968 kilograms per cm2 to fully open the valve.This results in a rising pressure versus flow characteristic particularly at the smaller valve openings which is considered undesirable for accurate pressure control. Thirdly, unless an expensive and complicated compound wound spring is employed, it is almost impossible to provide a spring biased, pilot relief valve which will perform equally well at both high and low pressures.Thus, at low pressures e.g. 100 psi, the valve must open the maximum designed amount to permit the necessary fluid flow to effect operation of the main relief valve.At the higher pressures1 e.g. 6,000 psi, the valve need only open a very small amount to permit the necessary volume of fluid flow to actuate the main relief valve.Thus, if a low spring rate spring is employed to give good pressure versus flow characteristics at low pressures.when the spring is compressed to require a higher opening pressure, the valve becomes unstable. If a high spring rate spring is employed to give stability and good pressure versus flow characteristic at higher pressure, then the pressure versus flow characteristics at low pressure are poor. At the higher pressures, this adverse effect of a rising force displacement ch.aracteristic of a spring is acerbated by the apparent drop in pressure on the valve element as the valve opens due to the conversion of the pressure energy on the element to velocity energy. This effect will hereinafter be referred to as the Bernoulli effect. The Bernoulli effect results in an apparent drop of up to about 10 in the opening pressure force on the valve element as the flow increases. This apparent lowering of the pressure force against the increasing spring bias further adversely effects the pressure versus flow characteristics of the valve. It is known to provide electro magnetically controlled valves employing solenoids. However, heretofore the electro magnetic force displacement curves of the solenoid were such as to make them unsatisfactory for use in place of a variably compressed mechanical spring. THE INVENTION The present invention contemplates a fluid valve using a new electro magnetic spring which overcomes all of the above referred to problems, provides improved force displacement curves over a mechanical spring and enables remote control of the opening pressures of andlor fluid flow through the valve. In accordance with the broadest aspect of the invention, a fluid valve is provided which includes an electro magnetic spring comprised of axially spaced, magnetically permeable supporting and attracting sleevelike pole pieces a solenoid coil surrounding both sleeves and, a cylindrical magnetically permeable armature operatively associated with a valve element to vary the bias force thereon, the armature having a first end in radially close spaced relationship to and substantially axially overlapping the supporting sleeve and the other second end at all times in radially close spaced relationship and slightly axially overlapping the end of the attracting sleeve.Importantly, there are only radially facing surfaces between the armature ends and the sleeves, i.e. there are no axially facing, magnetically permeable surfaces associated with the sleeves which are axially opposed to and axially spaced from axially facing surfaces on the armature a distance close enough to exert any significant axial magnetic force on the armature. Physically, this involves an axial distance greater than 51 mm. Also, the sligh overlap must exist throughout the entire designed range of movement of the armature, e.g. 51 102 mm. In such an arrangement, the solenoid, when energized, creates a magnetic flux to exert an axial magnetic force on the armature attempting to pull it into the attracting pole piece with a force which is always decreasing with increasing overlap. In effect, the armature pole piece combination is an electro magnetic spring exerting a force like a spring1 the amount of which is a function of the level of solenoid energization. Thus, by the term electromagnetic spring as used in the specification and claims, is meant a solenoid coil, magnetic pole piece, armature combination which, over its intended or designed range of movement, acts similar to a mechanical spring, i.e.when the armature is pushed to move in a direction against the axial magnetic force and out of the attracting field pole, the force to push it increases as it moves as a result of the force. As used in the specification and claims, substantially overlapping means an axial overlap of a distance at least greater than 1.2 cm., ánd slightly overlapping means an axial overlap of a distance such that if the overlap increases, the axial magnetic force decreases or vice versa. Physically, in the preferred embodiment of this invention, this represents an overlap at least greater than 0 up to about 2.5 cm. Above this maximum overlap, the axial force has decreased to such an extent as to be of no practical value in a valve. Close spaced means the outer surface of the magnetically permeable material of the armature is as close radially to the inner surface of the magnetically permeable material of the sleeves as the normal sliding clearances between the surfaces plus the thickness of any magnetically non permeable material on the surfaces will permit. The present invention may be distinguished from the disclosure in my United States Patent No. 4,464,977 where over at least the major portion of the designed range of movement of the armature toward the attracting sleeve, the axial magnetic force increases. Such a characteristic may be used where the only opposing force is created by a spring and the exact axial position of the armature is what must be controlled. In the present invention, in the total designed range of movement of the armature, as the slight overlap increases the magnetic force decreases and vice versa. Such a characteristic, in accordance with the invention, is useful where at least part of the opposing force is a variable created by fluid pressure into and or fluid flow through the valve. The variation in axial force of the electro magnetic spring with variations in the amount of the slight overlap can be pictured as a force displacement curve, with zero displacement being either when the valve is open or when the valve is closed. However, for convenience in explaining the operation of the magnetic spring of the invention, the zero point on the displacement axis will be considered to be when the extreme end of the radially close spaced portion of the attracted end of the armature is exactly radially aligned with the extreme end of the attracting sleeve. As is known, a mechanical spring has a linear, rising force displacement curve as it is compressed, and of course, when used in a valve, must be provided with an initial compress ion to give the desired initial valve operating characteristic. The electro magnetic spring of the present invention, through its designed range of movement, also has a rising force displacement curve as the armature is moved in a direction to decrease the slight overlap, but with beneficial differences, namely that 1. the initial force may be zero 2. the curve rises at an increasing rate i.e. it is slightly upwardly concave 3. the rate of rise is higher at higher levels of solenoid energization than at the lower levels and, 4. the force may be remotely controlled by varying the level of solenoid energization.This latter, of course, may be done by manually adjusting either the voltage or current output of an electric power supply or by automatically varying same by means of electronic control apparatus e.g. a computer or the like. The first three of these differences enable im proved valve operating characteristics while the last offers remote control of the valve operating characteristics. The solenoid of the present invention may be distin guished from other conventional solenoids wherein the attracting pole piece and the armature have axially facing, opposed surfaces, where, as the armature moves further and further into or toward the attracting pole piece, the axial magnetic force continually increases on a curve usually inversely proportional to the square of the spacing of the surfaces up to the maximum when the surfaces come into abutting relationship. Such a solenoi is unusable in valves of the type to which this invention pertains. It may also be distinguished from conventional pro portion solenoid type actuators where the desire is to obtath a flat force displacement curve over a maximum range of movement or where, as in German Patent No. 1,270,178, the force drops to zero so as to limit the stroke of the armature As the armature attracted end moves toward and into the attracting sleeve, the attracting force first increases until at some point in the movement, the attracting force begins to decrease. This point may vary depending on the configuration or shape of the ends of the attracting sleeve or the attracted endof the armature. In accordance with the invention, in all cases over the designed range of movement of the armature, the slight overlap is such that the force decreases with increasing overlap and means are provided to limit movement of the armature to their designed range of movement. Further in accordance with the invention, the overlapping ends of the attracting sleeve and or the attracted end of the armature are so shaped that at all levels of solenoid energization within the designed ranges of energization, the maximum force will occur at approximately the same amount of slight overlap whereby the same initial overlap may be used for all levels of solenoid energization. Also, the shape is such that the rate of rise of the curve has a desired slope simulating that of a mechanical spring. To accomplish this, the attracted end of the armature or the end of the attracting sleeve or both must taper outwardly and in the direction of the magnetic force. To achieve such a taper on the attracted end of the armature, the end is concave with an included angle on the metal being between 10 80 with 30 35 being preferred. Such a taper may be linear, stepped or arcuate, the former being preferred.At the lower angles, the curve is more linear and not as steep as at the greater angles. By varying the angle, various spring characteristics or spring rates can be achieved. The present concave shape of the armature attracted end provides maximum magnetic force with the maximum force occuring at just greater than zero overlap at all levels of solenoid energization. NORMALLY OPEN VALVE The electro magnetic spring of the invention is particularly of value in a normally open, pilot relief valve. In such a valve, in accordance with the invention, the armature and solenoid pole pieces are so arranged that when the solenoid is energized, the armature exerts a magnetic force on the valve element toward the valve seat. As such, when the solenoid is not energized, there is no closing force and fluid pressure will force the valve element and armature to the valve open position. When the solenoid is energized, the valve element is biased to the closed position by the electro magnetic spring which will allow the valve to open when the fluid pressure force on the valve element exceeds the magnetic force on the valve element.Because of the variation in the slope of the forcedisplacement curve for varying levels of solenoid energization, a spring rate of 4.6 kilograms per cm at high inlet pressure and 3.54 kilograms per cm at low inlet pressure can be achieved. No mechanical spring is required in a normally open valve. VALVE SEAT AND ELEMENT DESIGN In valves of the type to which this invention per tains, namely where the valve seat has a relatively small diameter, maintaining exact alignment of the valve seat and the valve seat engaging surface has .been difficult, either due to machining tolerances or to the fact that the valve element is slidable in a relatively large diameter cavity and the necessary clearances enable the valve element to cock slightly relative to the axis of the cavity and thus result in misalsgnment of the valve seat and the element surface. This is particularly so when the valve element is rigidly mounted on a magnetic armature. In such a case, the radial magnetic forces on the armature are always unbalanced and pull the armature with its valve element sidewardly and off center at least to the extent of the working clearance between the armature and its cylinder wall. In accordance with the present invention, the valve seat is formed at the end of a shallow bore on a valve seat member and the valve element is slidably mounted in this bore. The valve element is separate from the armature which simply abuts the end of the valve element remote from its valve seat engaging surface, but does not exert radial forces thereon. The valve member, with its valve element, is then mounted in the housing. It is believed that this independent valve member and valve element construction is new in valves. COMPENSATION FOR BERNOULLI EFFECT To compensate for the decreased pressure force on the valve element due to Bernoulli effect, in accordance with the present invention, an axially facing orifice associated with the valve element and or the armature is provided through which all fluid entering the valve inlet port flows to create a fluid flow force away from the valve seat and thus decreasing the force biasing the valve element toward the valve seat in an amount proportional to the reduction in the pressure force due to the Bernoulli effect. This results in a flatter pressure versus flow characteristic for the valve at the higher inlet pressures. As indicated, the slope of the magnetic forcedisplacement curve increases with increasing inlet pressures.In effect the fluid flow force tends to result in a flatter resultant curve of all the forces. Further in accordance with the invention, this orifice is in the form of a generally elongated passage. Such sn orifice is viscosity sensitive with the result that if the fluid is an oil whose viscosity is higher at lower temperatures, the flow force created by a given volume of fluid flow will be greater than when the oils are hot and less viscous. This arrangement requires a separate fluid outlet port on the end of the housing remote from the inlet port and all relieved fluid entering the inlet port flows longitudinally through the entire length of the housing. ARMATURE POSITION ADJUSTMENT A further problem with magnetically controlled valves of the present invention, is in accurately positioning the attracted end of the armature relative to the end of the attracting solenoid field pole during manufacture so that the initial overlap is exactly that desired.Thus, with a magnetic force displacement curve rising at a rate of 14.7 kilograms cm, every 0.127 mm variation in the amount of overlap produces 187 grams difference in magnetic force. If the tolerances in the manufacture of the various pieces stack up to 0.076 cm without adjustment, this will produce a 1.134 kilogram variation in magnetic force out of a maximum force of 3.40 kilograms, a 33 variation and unacceptable. In accordance with the present invention, means are provided for both limiting the range of movement to a desired range of movement and adjusting the position of the attracted end of the armature relative to the attracting end of the solenoid field pole when the armature is biasing the valve element into engagement with the valve seat.Such means could be a shim positioned between the armature and the valve element but in accordance with the invention, is a threaded member interposed between the armature and the valve element and fixedly and axially adjusted at the time of manufacture. In accordance with one aspect of the invention, the armature passage and outlet passage are axially aligned such that the adjustment can be made from outside of the valve housing during the assembly of the valve. In addition in accordance with the invention, further means are provided for adjustably limiting the movement of the armature. away from the valve seat such that the attracted end of the armature is always in at least partial overlapping relationship with the attracting end of the solenoid field pole in the extreme valve open position of the armature. In a preferred embodiment, such means include a threaded sleeve mounted in the end of the housing remote from the inlet port. PRESSURE COMPENSATED PILOT FLOW VALVE Further in accordance with the present invention, the electro magnetic spring of the invention can be employed in a proportional flow valve wherein the axial position of a valve element variably restricts the flow of fluid through a radially opening port. Mechanical spring means bias the valve element to an initial port closed position, and the electro mechanical spring exerts a magnetic force in opposition to the forces of the mechanical spring to position the valve element relative to the radially extending port dependent on the solenoid energization. Further in accordance with the invention, an orifice operatively associated with the valve element is provided through which all fluid flows to produce a pressure differential on opposite ends of the element and create a flow force in opposition to the electro magnetic spring force.No bias spring is required. Pressure compensated flow results. LARGER FLOW VALVES Further in accordance with the invention, the variable pressure compensated pilot flow valve is used in combination with larger volume pressure differential operated valves to remotely control the position of the valve member relative to its parts and thus the flow therethrough. The valve member may be a cylindrical piston of a two position, two ported valve or the spool piston of a multi ported, multi position valve. In either case, the piston is biased to one position by a spring and moved against the spring bias by pressure differentials created by controlled flow of fluid through the pilot valve also flowing through an air fire communicating inlet pressure on one end of the piston or spool to the other end. DEAD BAND COMPENSATION In an electro magnetic device where an armature moves in an amount proportional to the amount of solenoid energization, at the lower levels very little magnetic force is developed, in fact, not enough to overcome static friction,.otherwise known as stiction . If the power supply voltage output to the solenoid is variable from 0 as a base to the maxtmnn e.g. 12 volts, by means of a manual control, there is a dead band in the initial movement of the control where there is no apparent movement of the armature and no apparent effect on the fluid flow through the valve being con trolled. In accordance with the invention. light spring means are provided to lightly bias the armature to an initial position, either fully on or fully off and the power supply has a minimum voltage output above zero e.g. 1.5 to 2 volts for energizing the solenoid to produce a force just less than the opposing spring bias while the controller for the power source output voltage indicates zero. As a result, the dead band is eliminated and even small movements of the con troller results in an immediate movement of the armature. REDUCTION OF FRICTION When the solenoid is energized, a substantial radial magnetic force is exerted on the armature pulling it against the inwardly facing pole piece surfaces. This creates friction resisting axial movement of the armature. In accordance with the invention, these inwardly facing surfaces are coated with nickel applied by a chemical process e.g. electroless as distinguished from electrically deposited nickel to a uniform thickness of 0.0001 to 0.0003 inches. Such a coating in combination with the usual Teflon coatings used on the outside of armatures results in an extremely low coefficient of friction and a minimum hysterisis in the performance curves of the valves. The coating1 while called nickel, is actually a nickel phosphorous compound containing from 6 10 phosphorous and has a hardness of from 42 48 Rockwell C. It may thus be distinguished from pure nickel which is quite soft. Electroless nickel coatings, as used herein, is intended to mean such a nickel phosphor ous compound or its equivalent.

Figure 11 shows armature dispXacement solenoid energizing voltage curves of the embodiment of Figure 7. Referring now to the drawings, wherein the showings are for the purposes of illustrating preferred embodi ments of the invention only, and not for the purposes of limiting same Figures 1 and 2 show an electrically controlled hydraulic pressure relief valve comprised generally of an elongated housing H having an internal cavity C, a solenoid coil S surrounding the housing, a solenoid armature A slidable in the cavity, a valve seat forming member B, a valve element E biased toward the valve seat by the armature A, and an outlet port forming member P, all assembled into a single compact unit. The housing H is generally comprised of three members assembled into a single unitary member preferably by brazing and includes a lefthand member 10 of magnetically permeable material, which reading from left to right, includes a boss 12, having external threads 14, a groove 16 in which an O ring 18 is positioned, a hexagonal portion 20 of larger diameter and a sleeve portion 22 having an internal cylindrical surface 24, and an externally rabbeted right end 25 terminating in a righthand facing surface 26 perpendicular to the axis and intersecting the surface 24 at a right angle. The housing further includes a sleeve 30 of magnetically non permeable material, having an internal surface 31 of the same diameter as the surface 24, an internally rabbeted left end which mates with the rabbet on the right end of sleeve 22. The righthand end of the sleeve 30 is also internally rabbeted. The housing further includes a sleeve 40 of magnetically permeable material, having an internal surface 41 of a diameter the same as surface 24 with its lefthand end externally rabbeted to receive and mate with the rabbet on the right end of sleeve 30. These rabbeted surfaces are preferably brazed together so that the members 10, 30 and 40 are structurally integral and with surfaces 24, 31 and 41 defining cavity C.The .righthand end of sleeve 40 has external threads 44 to receive and mate with the internal threads of a magnetically permeable material end cap 50 which includes a radially inwardly extending flange 52 defining an opening therethrough of a diameter less than the diameter of the surface 41, to thus provide a lefthand facing shoulder 54, for purposes which will appear hereinafter. The inner surface 24, 31, 41 of sleeves 22, 30, 40 have a 0.0001 to 0.003 coating 55 of nlckel,put on by a known chemical deposition process as distinguished from an electro deposition process which substantially lowers the coefficient of friction with the armature A. In embodiment shown, the remaining portions of the rabbeted righthand end of the sleeve 22 and the remaining portion of the rabbeted end of the sleeve 40 is approximately twice the thickness of the remaining portion of the left and righthand rabbeted ends of the sleeve 30. If it were possible to obtain the mechanical strength and exact axial alignment of the sleeves 22, 30 and 40, it would be possible to eliminate the rabbeting of either the sleeve 22 or 40, and from a magnetic standpoint, this would be preferable. Instead of a brazed joint between the rabbets, they could be threaded or glued. The right hand outer corner of portion 20 is rabbeted to receive the left hand end of a magnetically permeable cylindrical housing 65, which extends into abutting engagement with the left hand end of the cap 50 and provides a housing for the solenoid S. SOLENOID The solenoid S is relatively conventional in construction and includes a plurality of turns of electrically insulated wire wound onto a bobbin 70 and has a pair of power leads 72 extending outwardly through a slot 74 in the right hand end of the housing 65. The solenoid S, for best operation, must surround I.E. overlap both sleeves 22 and 40 which are of magnetically permeable material and form its field poles. The solenoid S may be energized from any suitable power source. Preferably the power supply is one which delivers a current constant at any preset value. With such an arrangement as the solenoid heats and its resistance changes, the the current in the solenoid will remain the same and thus the magnetic force on the armature A will remain the same resulting in a valve having a constant opening pressure at any present value. A constant voltage power supply can be used, but with a result that there may be some variation in the opening pressure as the valve heats and the resistance of the solenoid coil changes. Dither or pulse width modulated energization causes the valve to be unstable and should not be employed. OUTLET PORT FORMING MEMBER The outlet port forming member P has on its right end means for being detachably and sealingly coupled to a hydraulic hose, such as the conical surface 80, and threads 82. The member P includes a central portion 84 of a diameter to fit within the opening of the flange 52 and a lefthand portion 86 of a greater diameter to fit within sleeve 40 and form a shoulder, abutting shoulder .54. Portion 86 has a groove in which an 0being 88 is positioned for sealing against the innersurface 41 of sleeve 40. The member P has a longitudinal passage 90 opening through the conical surface 80 and at its left end has a threaded counterbore in which a Mac it sleeve screw 94 is threadably engaged. Such a screw has a self locking characteristic in any adjusted position.The sleeve screw 94 has a longitudinal, hexagonally shaped passage 96 to coact with a suitable adjusting tool such as an Allen wrench. The diameter of the passage 90 is such as to permit the passage of such Allen wrench. VALVE SEAT AND ELEMENT MEMBERS The valve seat member B is in the form of an elongated tubelike member sealed in a cylindrical opening in the member 10 and has a flange 100 on its lefthand end abutting against the lefthand end of the threaded boss 12. Member B extends into the cavity C and its right end has a counter bore 102 in which the valve element is slidably supported. The member B also has a counter bore 110 in its left end which is coitinunicated with the bore 102 by a drilled passage 112, which at its right end defines with the base of the bore 102, a valve seat 116. The valve element E is comprised of a cylindrical portion 120 of a diameter to be slidably supported in the bore 102, and a lefthand portion 122 of reduced diameter, the lefthand end of which is conically shaped as at 124 to form a valve seat engaging surface for engaging the valve seat 116. The diameter of this valve seat defines the area of the inlet port and thus for a given inlet pressure a determinable pressure force to the right on the valve element E tending to open the valve.The diameter of passage 112 is 0.031 inches for 6,000 psi, 0.043 inches for 3,000 psi and 0.058 for 1,500 psi, maximum inlet pressure. Crossedrilled passages 130 communicate the base of the bore 102 with the cavity C. With this arrangement of the valve seat member B and valve element E, the passage 112 and valve seat 116 are formed at the base of a relatively short cylindrical counter bore and the valve element E is slidable within this bore with its valve seat engaging surface in close proximity to the cylindrical surfaces of its cylindrical portion 120. Maintaining the tolerances on such surfaces during manufacture and thus alignment on assembly is much easier than if the valve seat 116 were formed at the base of the cavity formed by the sleeves 24, 30 and 40. In addition, there are no side or lateral forces on the valve element E which would tend to move its valve seat engaging surface out of alignment with the valve seat engaging surface 116.It is believed that this construction is novel in a high pressure valve where precision and exact alignment of a metal valve seat and its engaging metal surface is necessary. ARMATURE The armature A is generally cylindrical and of an outer diameter to be slidingly supported by the inner surfaces of sleeves 22, 30 and 40. The armature A is made from magnetically permeable material and preferably has its outer surface coated with a thin, approximately 0.025 0.075 mm thickness of Teflon or other anti friction, magnetically non permeable material. The armature A has a longitudinal passage 140, of a pre determined diameter, which forms a viscosity sensitive orifice for the tlow of released fluid from the lefthand end of the valve through and out of the righthand end of the valve. The lefthand end of the armature A, in accordance with the invention, is concave with the concavity being defined by a conical surface 150 which tapers outwardly from passage 140 toward the valve seat 116 at an angle with the outer surface terminating in a narrow axially facing surface 152. As will appear, the size of angleW and the width of surface 152 have an important effect on the performance characteristics of the valve.This included angle may vary from 200 to 800, with 350 being preferred. Importantly, the left end of armature A,i.e. surface 152,slightly overlaps the right end of sleeve 22 by a distance 0 which is critical to the proper operation of the magnetic circuit and thus the valve. Also, the left end of the magnetically permeable portion of armature A is as radially close spaced to the radially inwardly facing surface of sleeve 22 as the working or sliding clearance plus the thickness of any antifriction coatings will permit. A magnetically non permeable spacer member 160 is provided between the lefthand end of the armature A and the righthand end of the valve piston V. which spacer member 160 has an outer diameter so as to be slidable within the cylindrical surface 24 and has a plurality of axial passages 162 therethrough. The center portion of spacer 160 has a setscrew 166 extending therethrough, the lefthand end of which engages the righthand end of the valve element E and the right hand end of which is aligned with passage 140 and slotted to engage a screwdriver. The lefthand axially facing surface 152 of armatureA abuts against a corresponding righthand end axially facing surface on spacer 160 such that when armature A has a magnetic force to the left exerted thereon, it biases spacer 160 to the left which, through screw 166, in turn biases the valve piston V to the left i.e. to the valve closed position. By biasing is meant an axial force in the opposite direction results in movement of the armature in the latter direction until the forces are in balance or the armature has reached the physical limit of its movement in that direction. Screw 166 is adjusted by means of an elongated screwdriver inserted through passage 90 in member P, passage 96 in the sleeve screw 94, and passage 140 in the armature A.Screw 166 enables exact adjustment of the position of the lefthand of armature A i.e. of overlap W after the valve has been assembled. Such exact adjustment is necessary to the proper operation of the magnetic circuit as will appear. MAGNETIC CIRCUIT In accordance with the invention, the member 10, which includes portion 20, sleeve 22 , the sleeve 40 and cap 50 are all formed of magnetically permeable material to form spaced field poles for the solenoid S. Sleeve 30 is formed of magnetically non permeable material and forms what may be termed a magnetic airgap for the soleniod S which, when electrically energized, generates a magnetic flux of opposite magnetic polarity at each end. As such, portion 20 and sleeve 22 will always be of opposite magnetic polarity from sleeve 40 and cap 50. Further in accordance with the invention, the atma ture A is also formed of magnetically permeable material, and as shown, includes a righthand supported portion which substantially overlaps the sleeve 40 which hereinafter may be called the supporting field pole of solenoidS. The lefthand end of the armature A may be termed the attracted end of the armature, and must slightly overlap at all times the righthand end of sleeve 22 which may be termed, the attracting field pole of solenoid S. Importantly, there are no axially aligned a.d opposed magnetically permeable surfaces on the armature A and the two sleeves close enough to result in any appreciable magnetic forces between the two. Also, importantly, the radially facing surfaces of the magnetically permeable surfaces have the minimum possible clearance consonant with the working or sliding clearance and the thickness of any antifriction coating which intentionally limits the minimum clearance to 0.001 inches. This provides the maximum axial force with a restricted radial force, the latter of which creates friction opposing axial movement. i en the solenoid S is electrically energized, a magnetic flux is generated, which then flows into and through the magnetically permeable members, namely, radially through the cap 50, axially through the sleeve 40, radially into the armature A, axially through the armature A to its lefthand attracted end, radially into the sleeve 22, axially through the sleeve 22, and radially through the sleeve 60. Sleeve 65 is of magnetically non permeable material. This magnetic flux creates a magnetic force on the armature A pulling it to the left, that is toward the valve seat 116, with a force which for a constant energization of solenoid S, varies in accordance with the amount of overlap 0. MAGNETIC F0.LCE CURVES In Figure 4, curve D shows the variation in the axial magnetic forces on the armature A as the amount of overlap 0 varies from less than 0 negative overlap to O to 0.100 inches positive overlap for 10 volts of solenoid energization and an angle W of 35 , the solid line 170 indicating measured values in the usable ranges of overlap and the dashed line 178 indicating estimated values in the unstable, unusable ranges of overlap, zero being where the ends of the attracting sleeve and the attracted portions of the armature are aligned. As shown by curve 178, the axial magnetic force on the armature A as the end of the armature approaches the end of the attracting sleeve increases rapidly from a low value on what is believed to be a hyperbolic curve where the force is inversely proportional to the square 2 U J 2 140 ounces at zero overlap. Thereafter, curve 170 shows the force decreasing at a generally decreasing rate until the armature A is magnetically centered relative to the air gap. Dimension X indicates the range of the curve, about 0.05 cm, used in the preferred embodiment. Figure 5 shows the variation in axial magnetic forces on the armature A from zero overlap to a maximum of 0.250 cm with.curve 1V representing 1 volt solenoid energization, curve 2V, two volts, curve 4V four volts, curve 6V six volts, curve 8V eight volts and curve lOV, the maximum designed energization voltage of ten volts. These curves represent the magnetic forces on the armature A biasing it to the left and thus the valve element 120 to the valve closed position. The included angle W may vary from 200 to 800. At the lower angles there is a sacrifice of maximum force, but with the point of maximum force C occuring essentially at the same amount of overlap energization for all levels of solenoid energization. At the higher angles, there is a higher maximum force but with the point of maximum force occuring at different amounts of overlap with differing degrees of solenoid energization. A reasonable compromise between maximum force and location of the maximum force is attained with angles of 20040c with 350 being preferred. Also the width of surface 152 affects the operation with greater widths acting the same as variations in the angle W. With a 30e angle and up, a width of 0.127 mm is preferred. With a 200 angle a width of 0.100 cm is preferred. The initial overlap is so chosen that at all levels of solenoid energization, the magnetic force is increasing as the overlap decreases through the maximum designed range of movement of the valve element. In effect, the arrangement acts like an electro magnetic spring biasing the valve element to the closed position, with the force of the spring being remotely controllable by varying the solenoid S energization. OPERATION In operation, hydraulic pressure on the left end of the valve element 120 creates a hydraulic force to the right in opposition to the magnetic force on the armatureA. When the hydraulic force exceeds the magnetic force, the valve element 20 is moved to the right forcing the armature A to move to the right, but as the armature A is moved to the right, its force to the left increases, thus opposing the opening of the valve in the same manner as a mechanical spring with its increasing force as it is compressed. The valve shown has a maximum opening of 5.08 mm, and in accordance with the invention, the initial amount of overlap O in the valve closed position is adjusted to approximately 0.100 cm. As the valve opens to its maximum, the overlap will decrease to 0.050 cm. By adjusting screw 166, the amount of initial i.e.valve closed overlap 0 may be readily adjusted. By adjusting screw 94, the maximum movement of the armatureA to the right, and thus the minimum overlap may be readily adjusted, all at the time of assembly of the valve. The slope of each curve, 1V, 2V, 4V, 6V, 8V and lOV increases with decreasing overlap. Thus, for any level of solenoid energization, the force required to open the valve increases in a non linear manner resulting in improved pressure vs flow characteristics. Also, the relative slopes of the curves progressively increase with increasing energization. Inasmuch as the opening pressure of the valve is a function of the degree of energization of the solenoid, it will be appreciated that the electro magnetic spring described has a forcedisplacement rate at the higher pressures which is above that at the lower pressures. A minimum spring rate of 3.54 kilograms per cm and a maximum spring rate of 14.16 kilograms per cm is preferred. BERNOULLI EFFECT COMPENSATION when the valve opens, fluid flows inwardly through passage 112, through port 130 into cavity C then through ports 162 and longitudinally through the passage 140 in armature A. This passage in the preferred embodiment has a diameter of 0.635 cm, and functions as an axially facing orifice restricting the flow of fluid with a result that there is a pressure drop between the left and right ends of armatureA creating a hydraulic flow force to the right on the armature A proportional to the volume of fluid flowing. By varying the diameter of this passage, the flow force can be varied. This hydraulic flow force being to the right, in effect subtracts from the lefthand magnetic force of the armature A on the valve element.This compensates for the reduction in pressure force to the right on valve element E caused by theBernoulli effect of the high velocity flow of fluid past the valve seat engaging surface 124 and results in a valve having improved flow characteristics.Obviously, the orifice could be formed on or in member 160. Also, the outlet passage could be through the side of the cavity by the formation of appropriate ports. ALTERNATIVE EMBODIMENTS The valve described is a normally open valve which is closed when the solenoid is energized, the amount of energization determining the opening pressure.For all pressures below the maximum, the valve may be used as a simple on off valve by simply turning on or off full energization of the solenoid. In the embodiment shown in Figure 3, the end of the attracting sleeve adjacent to the magnetic air gap has a substantial radial thickness and a surface which is perpendicular to the axis while the concave attracted end of the armature A tapers outwardly generally to a blunt point.With this construction, the magnetically permeable material in the end of the armature A saturates at the higher levels of solenoid energization with the result that the slope of the force displacement curve increases at the higher degrees of solenoid energization. Figure 6 shows an alternative embodiment of the invention where like parts will be given like numbers with a prime mark added. In this embodiment, the left end 152 of armature A is perpendicular to the axis, while the outer surface 25 of the rabbit on the right end of the attracting sleeve 24 tapers outwardly toward the valve seat and surface 26 has the same radial width as surface 152 in the preferred embodiment. This embodiment is the equivalent of the preferred embodiment in terms of magnetic characteristics. It is also possible to divide the taper between the armature end and the attracting sleeve end with equal results. PRESSURE COKPENSATED FLOW VALVE Figure 7 shows an electrically controlled flow valve assembled with a manifold housing M and including a main valve MV comprised of a main valve housing MH and a pressure differential actuated main valve element ME biased to a closed position by a main spring MS and, a pilot valve PV comprised of a pilot valve housing PH a pilot valve element PE a pilot valve armature PA a solenoid coil PS for creating a magnetic force on the armature PA and biasing it to the left and a spring PS for biasing the valve element against the magnetic force on the armature PA. The manifold housing forms no part of the prevent invention and is shown simply for the purposes of illustration. It includes an inlet passage IP, a main outlet passage MP and a tank passage TP. The main valve housing MH is comprised generally of a single machined member of any desired material, brass, steel, stainless steel or aluminum and has an internal cylindrical passage 200 opening through the left end to form an inlet port and which is counterbored at the right end to provide a lefthand facing shoulder 202.Externally, the main valve housing MH, reading from left to right includes a groove to receive an O ring seal 204 a portion of reduced diameter to provide with the manifold housing M an outlet manifold 206 to main outlet passage MP a pair of diametrically opposed rectangular main outlet ports 208 a groove to receive an O ring seal 210 a portion of reduced diameter to provide with manifold housingMH an outlet manifold 212 to the tank passage TP a Abraded pQXtioB 214 mating with treads on the manifold housing a groove to receive an O ring seal 216 and a portion of a larger diameter 218 which is hexagonally shaped to receive and coact with a wrench or the like. Additionally, the housing MH has a passage 210 communicating the tank passage manifold 212 with the interior of the main valve housing MH just to the right of the lefthand end of the pilot valve housing PH. The pilot valve housing PH has an internal cylindrical passage 220 opening to the left and counterbored at its right end to provide a righthand facing shoulder 222. Externally, the pilot valve housing PH reading from left to right includes a boss 223 of an outer diameter to fit into the counterbored end of the main housing MH a groove to receive sn O ring seal 224 which seals against the inner wall of the main valve housing MH a portion of reduced diameter to provide a manifold 226 communicating with passage 212 and tank port TP a threaded portion 228 to mate with threads on the inside of the main valve housing, a groove to receive an O ring seal 230, a portion of larger diameter 232 which has a hexagonal outer shape to receive e wrench and a sleevelike portion 234 extending to the right and externally rabbeted to provide a portion of reduced diameter 236. At least portions 232 and 234 are formed of magnetically permeable material. The housing PH also includes a sleeve of magnetically nonpermeable material 240 internally rabbeted at both ends and having an inner surface of the same diameter as the inner surface of the sleevelike portion 234. The pilot valve housing PH also includes a sleeve 244 of magnetically permeable material, externally rabbeted on the left end to mate with the rabbets of the nonszgnetic sleeve 240 and an inner surface having diameter the same as sleeve 234. The inner surfaces of these sleeves 234, 240, 244 are honed to a smooth surface and have a 0.0025 0.0075 mm coating of nickel 247 deposited by known chemical deposition process as distinguished from electro deposition for the purpose of reducing friction with the armature PA. Tbt pilot valve housing PH further includes a cap 248 of magnetc.Uy permeable material threaded on to the righthand end of sleeve 244, which cap has a flange 252 extending radially inwardly to a diameter just less than the inner diameter of sleeve 244. An end sealing member 253 of magnetically non permeable material extends into the righthand end of sleeve 244 and has a groove in its outer surface to receive an O ring seal 254 which engages the inner sur face of sleeve 244, and a portion of reduced diameter to provide a shoulder which abuts against the lefthand facing surface of flange 252. Member 253 also has a threaded bore in which a sleeve screw 260 is mounted in the lefthand end and a plug 260 in the righthand end. Pilot valve solenoid PS surrounds and overlaps sleeves 234, 240 and 244 and includes an outer housing 264 of magnetically permeable material which extends into abutting overlapping relationship with the por tions 232 and cap 248 generally as shown. Adjacent to the lefthand end of pilot housing PH, a pair of crossed drilled openings 270 provide pilot valve outlet ports nominally cormnunicating passage 220 with the manifold 226. Pilot valve element PE is moveably supported in passage 220 for the purpose of variably restricting ports 270. Pilot valve element PE in the embodiment shown, is formed of magnetically nonpermeable material and includes a central passage 274 communicated to the lefthand end through an axially facing orifice 276. Pilot valve element PE has an external groove 278 communicating with passage 274 by cross drilled openings 280.The righthand end of pilot valve member PH is counterbored to receive a magnetically nonpermeable insert 282 having on its right end a ported flange of a diameter larger than the outer diameter of pilot valve element PE to provide a lefthand facing shoulder against which a pilot valve spring 284 abuts and at the opposite end abuts against the shoulder 222 to bias the pilot valve element to the right. Spring 284 has a spring rate of 1 pound per inch, and an initial compression force of 4 ounces. Insert 282 has a drilled passage 285 communscating pressures in bore 274 with the righthand end of the cavity defined by the sleeves 234, 240 and 244. A magnetically nonpermeable spacer member 286, having axial extending passages 288, is positioned to the right of the insert 282 and has a threaded member 290 abutting against the righthand surface of insert 282. Spacer 286 has a diameter such as to slide freely in sleeve 234. The pilot valve armature PA is formed of magnetically permeable material and has an internal passage 292 and an outer coating of Teflon or other antifriction materlal of a thickness of between 0.025 and 0.075 mm, preferably theinner surfaces of sleeves 234, 240, 244 are also Teflon coated as well as sleeves 22, 30 and 40. The main valve element MV is generally in the shape of a cup having an axially facing orifice 294 in its base 296 and is lightly biased to the left by a sPring 298 bearing at its left end against the base of the cun 296 and at its right end against a twanged washer 300 which abuts against the lefthand end of the pilot valve housing PH. Main val element MV defines with cavity 200, a variable pressure chamber 301. Spring 298 in the preferred embodi ment has a spring rate of 80 pounds per cm and an initial compression force of 5 pounds. The main valve element MV has a flange 302 on its righthand end which abuts against the shoulder 202 to limit its movement to the left. The left hand end of the valve element extends to the left of the lefthand side of the main outlet ports 208 with a slight overlap generally as shown. Move ment of the main valve element ME to the right, restrictwvely communicates the inlet port with port 208 allowing flow of fluid there through in an amount proportional to the amount of the opening of 208 and tb. inlet pressure. The main valve is a pressure differential actuated two position two ported valve. Thus, the valve element Mv is in the form of a piston. The main valve could also be multi ported and multi positioned. As such, the valve element MV would then be in the form of a spool biped in one direction by a spring and moved against the spring bias by pressure differentials developed there W088 . . . PDWER SOURCE The power source for the pressure compensated flow valve is preferably a variable 1 .C. source having a minimum output voltage sufficient to create an axial magnetic force on armature PA just equal to the force of spring 284 when groove 278 is just about to connunicate with openings 280, this mini wNm voltage being present even though the controller for the source indicates zero output voltage. As such, even a slight movement of the controller towards increased voltage results in movement of the armature PA and a change in the relative position of groove 278 and ports. 280. This minimum voltage is about 2 volts. Preferably, the source also superimposes a con vontional square wave dither voltage on the D.C. out put voltage. Curve 350 of Figure 10 shows the armature tisplacement va. controller position apparent to the operator when using two volts minimum compared to a similar curve 352 where the minimum output voltage is zero, the curves on the negative sides of the axes being what would be true if the armature were to move bidirectionally as in some of my earlier applications. With this arrangement, the controller can be calibrated directly in fluid volume per minute of flow. OPERATION In operation with the solenoid PS unenergized, the various valve elements will be in the position shown and inlet pressure flows through orifice 294, orifice 276 and orifice 285 such that in the valve shown, the entire inside of the two housings MH, PH will be at inlet pressure. Valve member ME is thus in hydraulic pressure force balance and is biased to the left by spring 298. Spring 284 biases the pilot valve element PE and along with it spacer 286 and the armature PA to the right such that groove 278 and pilot valve outlet ports 270 are substantially closed from communication with each other. In this position, the lefthand end of armaturePA has an overlap 0 with the righthand end of the rabbetedrportion 236 and the lands between groove 278 and ports 270 have a slight overlap. When the power source is first energized, even though its controller indicates zero output voltage, its minimum output voltage energizes solenoid PA to create a magnetic force on armature PA just less than or equal to the force of spring 284. When the solenoid is further energized, the magnetic force created on armature PA.causes it to move to the left against the bias of spring 284 bringing groove 278 into communication with pilot valve outlet ports 270. Hydraulic fluid flows through orifices 294 and 276 and through outlet port 270, passage 210, manifold 212 to the tank. Such a flow produces a pressure drop across orifice 294. This produces a pressure differential on opposite axially facing surfaces of the main valve element ME creating a flow force to the right causing it to move to the right against the bias spring 294 and communicating the inlet port with ports 208. Plow of fluid through orifice ,q creates a pressure drop thereacross resulting in a pressure force to the right on pilot valve element PE. This force is opposed by the magnetic force to the left on armature PA. The pilot valve element PE reaches a position relative to outlet port 270 where the magnetic forces of armature PA, spring forces of 284 and the flow forces are in balance. If the inlet pressure should drop whereby the pressure drop across orifice 276 should drop, the magnetic force will move the pilot valve element to the left to increase the degree of communication with outlet port 270 and maintain a constant flow to orifice 294 and orifice 276 regardless of variations of the inlet pressure. By varying the energization of solenoid coil PS, the magnetic force to the left on armature PA can be varied, which will thus vary the rate of fluid flow through orifices 294 and 276. Variation in the flow of fluid through orifice 294 varies the flow force to the right against the bias of spring 298 resulting in movement of the main valve element ME to vary the communication of inlet with the outlet 208. The outlet ports 208 are rectangular having two circumferentially extending sides. Flow through port 208 is thus directly proportional to the axial movement of element ME. It is important that the overlap of the left end of armature PA and the right end of a reduced portion of 236 of sleeve 230 be such that when armature PA moves to the left against the force of spring 284, the magnetic force decreases. In effect, the solenoid coil and the armature create what may be termed a electro magnetic spring, the force ot which may be varied by varying. the energization of the solenoid PS. A flow valve results whereby a constant flow through the valve can be obtained for any setting of solenoidPS energization. The righthand surface of main valve element NE defines with the cavity a variable pressure chamber which pressure varies with the amount of fluid flowing through pilot valve PV as determined by the energization of solenoid coil PS. Obviously, the orifice 294 communicating the inlet port with this variable volume chamber can be other than as shown and through the housing or through a separate passage externally of the housing. Above a predetermined inlet pressure, the pressure flow force to the right on element PE is a function of the pressure drop across and thus the diameter of orifice 276 and the area of the left end of element PE, both of which are determined at the time of manufacture to correspond to the maximum magnetic force capabilities of the solenoid . armature combination. In the preferred embodiment, the diameter of clement PE and orifice 276 are 1.77 cm and 1.07 mm respectively. Solenoid PS has 940 turns of 24 gage copper wire and a 9 ohm resistance. In a similar manner, the pressure or flow force on element ME is a function of the pressure drop across, and thus the diameter of, orifice 294 multiplied by the area of the left end of element ME. In the preferred embodiment, the diameters of element ME and orifice 294 are 1.588 cm and 0.79 mm respectively. These dimensions are proportioned to act with the spring rate of spring 298. SUMMARY Thus, it will be seen that an electrically controllable variable relief and or flow valve has been provided which does not require a mechanical spring. I believe I am the first to have ever done this. Further, a solenoid armature arrangement has been provided that has improved performance characteristics over a mechanical spring of equivalent force rating. In fact, the arrangement may be termed an electro magnetic spring. Further, I have provided valves having low hysterisis which can be made almost entirely from screw machine products and which are compact and readily stickable on a common manifold. The invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments. Obviously, modifications and alterations will occur to others upon reading and understanding of this specification, and it is my intention to include all such modifications and alterations insofar as they come in the scope of the appended claims.
