# Short circuit distance relay.

## Abstract
In a short circuit distance relay for protecting a single channel power transmission system with power supplies installed at two ends thereof, when there exists any resist ance at a fault point on the power transmission line, an error is induced in measurement of the distance up to the fault point by a voltage drop component flowing through the fault point resistance from the remote end power supply. In order to eliminate such error in measuring the distance, the relay of this invention computes the impedance up to the fault point from the information including a positive phase voltage and a positive phase current in a normal state of the power transmission system, and also a positive phase voltage, a positive phase current and a negative phase current in a faulty state of the system, whereby the fault point resistance is rendered unconcerned with the distance to consequently avert the measurement error.
