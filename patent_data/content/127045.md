# Apparatus for producing a light source of required shape.

## Abstract
Apparatus for producing a line source of a desired shape from a light source 10 such as an excimer laser comprising means 12, 14, 16 for directing the light source along a pre determined path to a cylindrical lens 18 positioned to pro duce a vitural line image SÂ¹ having uniform intensity along its length at a first location. However, the image is intercepted by a cylindrical mirror 20 inclined at an angle so that the beam is transformed into a curved shape and directed onto a quartz diffuser 22 . This apparatus produces a curved self luminous distribution having uniform intensity over its length. In a specific embodiment, the diffuser is a directional diffuser.
