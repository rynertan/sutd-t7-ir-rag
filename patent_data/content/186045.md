# 1,4 Dipyrimidinylbenzene derivative and liquid crystal composition containing it.

## Abstract
A novel 1,4 dipyrimidinylbenzene derivative which is useful as a component constituting a liquid crystal composi tion which is superior in properties and also physically and chemically stable, as a material for liquid crystal display elements, and a liquid crystal composition containing the same are provided, which derivative is expressed by the formula
