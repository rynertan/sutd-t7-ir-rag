## Description
MOTION TRANSMITTING DEVICE This invention relates to a motion transgitting device. The invention has particular, but not exclusive, application to the transmission of switch operating movement to an electrical switch. from a snitch control or setting rember. An obJect o tne invention is to provide a motion transmitting device capable of transmitting movement from a control or settin member to a driven member, such as switch operating member, movable in a direction which is at an angle to te direction of movement of tne control or setting member. . further object ol the invention is to provide such a motion transmitting device which is of simple one piece construction. according to the present invention there is providei a motion transaitting device comprising a lever having an arm angageable by a control or setting member ani a plunger pivotally connected to the lever and engageable vith a driven member to efiect displacement thereof upon pivotal movement of tne lever by means of the control member, characterised in that the lever and the plunger are formed of one piece of plastics material, the pivotal connection between the lever and the plunger being afforded by a flexible portion of the same plastics material integral with the lever and the plunger. The motion transmitting device may be adapted to transmit movement from a control or setting member to a driven member movable in a direction substantially perpendicular to t..e direction of movement of the control or setting member. For example, the control or setting member may comprise a switch operating cam engaging an arm of the lever, while the driven member way comprise a switch operating member such as a tongue o a snap acting switch blade, i.ov .ble in a direction subst intially pargendicular to the direction of mo ement of the cam. Plastics material from which the device is made should have sufficient tensile strength to per it the transmission of linear displacement to the plunger upon pivotal movement of the lever, while having suflicient flexibility in the portion forming tte pivotal connection to permit rocking movement of the lever relative to the plunger. Examples of suitable plastics material for te device are polypropylene and nylon. refer ably the lever is fixed to a pivot shaft which is also formed integrally witn tne lever anS the plunger in the same plastics material as the latter. The pivotal connection may comprise a ligament hinge permitting flexing of tne lever relative to the plunger aboJt un axis parallel to the axis of the pivot shaft. Preferably the lever is a belicrank lever one arm of which is engageable with the control or setting member and the other arm of which is pivotally connected to the plunger. The flexible portion affording the pivotal connection between the lever and the plunger is preferably resilient so that it biases the plunger towards a predetermined angular position relative to the lever. The degree of resilience of the pivotal connection or hinge can be predetermined by suitably selecting tne thickness of the plastics material forming the pivotal connection.Constructed in this way t .e one piece plastics device of the present invention is mechanically equivalent to a mechanism consisting of a lever, a pivot snaft, a plunger pivotally connected to the lever, and a spring biasing the plunger towards a predetermined angular position relative to tse lever. Tiie one piece plastics device of the invention can therefore lead to a consideiable economy of construction and component parts in many practical applications. In a preferred embodiment of the invention the pivotal connection between the lever and the plunger is intermed.ate the ends of the plunger, one end of the plunger being adapted for engagement with guide. means which, upon rocking movement of the lever, cause the plunger to effect substantially linear displacement in the direction of its longitudinal axis. YVhere the device is formed with an integral pivot shCt, the shaft itself may be formed with trunnion elements at opposite ends which, upon mounting of the device, engage in bearing holes to form a pivotal mounting for the shaft,Preferably one trunnion element is slotted to permit its resilient engagement in a suitably sized aperture in a support or mounting. An embodiment of the invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying purely diagrammatic drawing, in which Figure 1 is a perspective view of a motion transmitting device according to one embodiment of the invention showing part of a mounting structure into which it fits Figure 2 is a diagrammatic side view illustrating eouivalent prior art device corresponding to that of Figure 1, d Figure 3 is a diagrammatic side elevation, partly in section, illustrating one practical application of the device of Figure 1 for the transmission of switch operating movement in an electrical switch unit. Referring to the drawings, the notion transmitting device shown in Figure 1 is meunted in a single piecs of plastics material, for example polypropylene, and has a pivot shaft 1 provided centrally with two projecting 7ever arms 2, 3 arranged substantially perpendicular to each other and together constituting a bellerank lever. The lever arm 2 is adapted to be engaged by a control or setting member, .ilile te other lever arm, 3, tapers in width towards an elongate plunger 4, moulied integrally with the lever arm 3, nd connected to the latter by way of an integral ligament hinge porion 5 which is resiliently flexible to permit rocking morement of the lever ar 3 relative to the plunger 4.The ligement hinge portion 5 defines hinge aris abich is suestanti lly garallel to the axis of the pivot shaft 1, while the longitudinal axis of the plunger 4 is perpendicular to the axis of the pivot haft 1. The plunger 4 is moulded with a bifurcated end portion defining a rectangular longitudinally extending slot 6 for engagement by a fixed guide member which, upon rocking movement of tne bellcrank lever 2, 3, guides the plunger to cause tne latter to efect substantially linear displacement in the direction of its longitudinal axis. The pivot shaft 1 is moulded at opposite ends with reduced dieneter cylindricAl trunnion elements 7,8 engageable in circular holes of a mounting structure to define the pivot axis of the sat 1. C ne of the trunnion elements, 8, is fores it a slot 9 extending longitudinally from its free end and imparting sufficient resilience to this trunnion element at 8 to permit its snap engagement in an appropriately sized aperture in e support or mounting. The construction of the device shown in Figure 1 is such th .t if a force indicated generally by the arro P is applied to the lever arm 2 with the pivot shaft 1 mounted tor rotation about its axis by means of the trunnion elements 7, 8, the bellcrank lever 2, 3 is rocked about the axis of the shaft 1, and causes linear displacement of the plunger 4, such displacement being transmitted to the plunger 4 by mens of the ligament hinge portion 5, which also permits flexing of the lever arm 3 relative to the plunger 4. Figure 2 shows a typical prior art motion transmitSing mechanism adapted to perform the same functions as the device of Figure 1. This mechanism comprises a shaft S, a bellcrank lever L and the rod R. In addition, to bias the lever L angularly relative to the rod R, a tension spring T is interposed between one arm of the bellcrank lever L and the rod R. The device according to the present invention illustrated in Figure 1 combines the functions of all the components S L, X, R and T of the prior art mechanism of Figure 2 in a single plastics moulded device, resulting in a considerable economy of construction.In particular, it shotlld be noted that the resilient ligament hinge portion 5 acts both as a pivotal connection between the bellcrank lever arm 3 and the plunger 4 and as a spring biassing the lever arm 3 angularly relative to the plunger 4. The biassing moment created about the hinge portion 5 will be determined by the relative angular positions in which the arm 3, the plunger 4 and the ligament hinge portion 5 are moulded, in relation to their intended positions of use, and will also be determined by the thicknes of the ligament hinge portion 5 itself. An example of one practical application of the device shown in Figure 1 is illustrated diagrammatically in Figure 3, in which the device transmits operating movement to an electrical switch. The pivot shaft 1 of the device is rotatably supported in a casing or mounting structure 10 of the switch, part of which is shown in Figures 1 and 2, the trunnion element 7 fitting closely in a circular hole 11 in one side wall of the switch casing, and the other, slotted trunnion element 8 fitting into a keyhole shaped aperture 12 in an opposite side wall of the switch casing. The keyhole shaped aperture 12 is formed by a first part circular hole 13 into which the trunnion element 8 may be inserted, and a smaller diameter second circular hole 14 into which the trunnion element 8 can be forced by squeezing together of the two halves of the trunnion element 8 formed by the slot 9.The hole 14 communicates with the larger hole 13 by way of a throat 15 of narrower width than the diameter of the smaller hole 14, so that the movement of the trunnion element 8 into the hole 14 takes place with a snap action. The device is arranged in the embodiment of Figure 3 so that the lever arm 2 of the bellcrank lever is engaged by an edge of a cam 16 mounted on an operating shaft 17 the axis of which is generally perpendicular to the pivot axis of the lever 2, 3. The slot 6 at one end of the plunger 4 is engaged in a guide member 18 which may be formed by upsetting a portion of one wall of the switch casing. In an alternative embodiment not shown the plunger 4 may have in place of the slot 6 z male extension piece which engages in a guide slot or guide hole in the switch casing to guide the displacement of the plunger 4. The end of the plunger 4 opposite the slot 6 engages a flexible operating tongue 19 of a snap action switch blade 20 carrying a switch contact 21 which can be moved into and out of engagement with a fixed contact 22. In the illustrated embodiment the switch contacts 21, 22 are normally closed and are opened with a snap movement by movement of the switch operating plunger 4 downwardly as viewed in Figure 2. The resilience of the flexible ligament hinge portion 5 between the bellcrank lever arm 3 and the plunger 4 is such that the lever arm 3 is biassed into a normal position which it is inclined to the longitudinal axle of the plunger 4. In the example illustrated, the lever arm 3 adopts a position inclined at 820 to the longitudinal axis of the plunger 4. The resilience of the hinged portion 5 tends to return the plunger to a position in which it is inclined at this angle to the lever arm 3, and accordingly the ligament hinge portion 5 is equivalent, as stated earlier, to a tension spring interposed between the plunger 4 and the lever arm 3, as shown diagrammatically by the broken outline ghost spring 23 shown in Figure 3. In a typical practical embodiment of the invention the motion transmitting device would be moulded in polypropylene, the hinge portion 5 consisting of a ligament having a thickness of 0.5 millimetres. It will be appreciated that the device according to the invention is applicable to the transmission of motion between relatively movable parts in general, being illustrated by way of example in its practical application as a switch operating device. In this latter application the device has the further practical advantage that, being of plastics material, it is electrically insulating, so tt.at it can be employed for the transmission of movement from a switch control or setting member such as the cam 16 shown in Figure 3 to a switch blade 20 which, when the switch is closed, may be electrically live. In the arrangement illustrated in Figure 3 the device would normally be installed in the switch casing by engagement of the guide member 18 in the slot 6 at the end of the plunger 4 in such a way that when so engaged the angle between the lever arm 3 and the plunger 5 is greater than the angle between these parts in the normal relaxed condition of the device, so that the ligament hinge portion 5 is prestressed, eliminating any play between the guide slot 6 and the guide member 18.
