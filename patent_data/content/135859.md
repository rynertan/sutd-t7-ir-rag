# A coring device with an improved weighted core sleeve and anti gripping collar.

## Abstract
An improved coring device that incorporates an nonrotat able inner barrel 50 disposed within the outer driving struc ture 12 of the drill string which is coupled to a the coring bit 30 . A woven metal mesh sleeve 105 is circumferentially mounted outside the inner barrel 50 and tucked around its lower end 112 . The lower end 110 of the mesh sleeve 105 in the inner barrel 50 is in turn connected to a stripper tube 40 which is pulled upwardly during the coring operation. As the core is cut by the coring bit 30 and enters the inner barrel 50 , the woven metal mesh sleeve 105 is disposed about the core and constricts about the core when pulled upwardly by the stripper tube 40 . The opposing end of the woven metal mesh sleeve is connected to a weight 125 which serves to compress the metal sleeve 105 when outside the inner barrel 50 , thereby increasing its diameter to prevent binding or jamming.
