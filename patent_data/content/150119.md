# INK JET RECORDING SYSTEM CAPABLE OF RECORDING HALF TONES

## Abstract
In order to obtain an adequate range of image density for half tone printing an ink jet print head assembly 14 comprises two ink jet heads 142a, 142b . These are driven by separate pulse generators 141a, 141b . A comparator 12 responds to a density signal from an image signal force 11 and controls a signal distributor 13 for selective energisa tion of the two heads. Below a threshold image density the head 142a is employed this has a weaker ink and or small nozzle. Above the threshold, the head 142b is employed and this has a denser ink and or a larger nozzle.
