# Curable fibre reinforced epoxy resin composition.

## Abstract
Curable compositions comprising epoxide prepolymers and polyaminobenzoates, alone, or combined with reinforcements, e.g., graphite fibers, and, optionally modified with second resins. The cured resin fiber matrix compositions exhibit high toughness combined with excellent hot wet strength. N,N min dimethyl aromatic diamines are prepared from the corresponding diprimary amines via a two step synthesis forming first the corresponding di succinylimidomethylamine and then reductively cleaving the succinylimido group. The products are useful, e.g., as epoxy curing agents. N,N,N min ,N min tetraglycidyl 1,3 propylene bis p aminobenzoate and homopolymers thereof and their use as curable epoxide prepolymers are also disclosed.
