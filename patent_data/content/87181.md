# Gamma correction circuit for television.

## Abstract
A gamma correction circuit for television, incorporating a gamma corrector 9 having an output 10 with a gamma corrected signal S2 , a first superposition stage 16 for supplying, relative to the linear input signal S1 a difference signal S3 which corresponds to the gamma correction, a second superposition stage 3 for supplying a signal S1 S3 which is formed by means of the difference signal S3 , with inverted gamma relative to the linear input signal S1 which signal S1 S3 is applied to the gamma corrector 9 . As a result thereof values which exceed the peak white value w are not displayed with a picture brightness which is less than the peak white value w .
