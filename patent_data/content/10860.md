# Load sensing control for hydraulic system.

## Abstract
A load sensing hydraulic system is disclosed of the type in which a load signal is communicated from down stream of a main flow control orifice 33 to a device 29 which is operable to vary the fluid delivery rate in response to changes in the load signal. Disposed in the load signal conduit is a load signal modulating valve 37 which, in one position, communicates the load signal, substantially unchanged, to the variable fluid source. In another position of the modulating valve 37 , the load signal chamber 29 of the variable fluid source is drained to tank 43 , while in intermediate positions of the modulating valve 37 , a portion of the load signal is communicated to the variable fluid source, and a portion is bled to tank 43 . Modulation of a load signal permits flow control in an hydraulic system, independent of the position or movement of the main spool valve 15 . The input to the modulating valve 37 may be manual or electric, and if electric, may be remote, or may be automatic in response to certain predetermined system conditions.
