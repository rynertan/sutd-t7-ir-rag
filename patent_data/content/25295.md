## Description
This invention relates to an operating assembly for a pushbutton mechanism, particularly but not exclusively a pushbutton switch. A previously proposed pushbutton switch is incorporated in a lever operated switch assembly for mounting on the stationary part of the steering column of a road vehicle. The lever extends generally radially of the steering column in use from a housing of the switch assembly, and movement of the lever about an axis generally parallel to the steering column axis operates a first switch, for example a direction indicator switch, of the assembly. The pushbutton switch of the assemby has its switching mechanism within the housing and is operated by movement of a knob, carried at the free end of the lever, against a resilient bias longitudinally of the lever towards the housing.The knob is slidable on the lever and is coupled to a push rod which extends through the lever to the switching mechanism. Thus movement of the knob is transmitted by the push rod to the switching mechanism to operate the switching mechanism. In the previously proposed arrangement the knob is in screw threaded engagement with one end of the push rod, the other end of the push rod carrying a switching mechanism operating component including a molded synthetic resin body secured to the push rod end by being molded therearound. Among the problems encountered in the previously proposed arrangement are firstly the difficulty of setting the position of the knob in relation to the push rod to ensure that adequate, but not excessive, movement of the push rod and thus the operating component can occur within the permitted range of movement of the knob relative to the lever. Clearly excessive movement of the operating component can result in damage to the switching mechanism and or the component, and insufficient movement of the component will result in failure of the switching mechanism to be operated. Setting has been achieved on a trial and error basis by rotating a cap of the knob, with which the push rod is in screw threaded engagement, relative to the push rod prior to securing the cap to the remainder of the knob. This is a skilled task and is time consuming.A second problem is that in the rest position of the operating component the component abuts the end of the lever remote from the knob. In this situation if the knob is not abutting an appropriate stop on the lever, as may well be the case owing to incorrect adjustment and or manufacturing tolerances, then if the operator applies a pull force to the knob the loading applied through the push rod can strip the molded block of the operating component from the end of the push rod. It is an object of the present invention to provide a pushbutton mechanism operating assembly wherein the aforementioned problems are minimized. A pushbutton mechanism operating assembly according to the invention includes a push rod, a support through which the push rod extends, the push rod being longitudin ally slidable relative to the support, an operating component secured to one end of the push rod, first stop means defining a rest position of the operating component, and therefore the push rod, relative to the support, a drive collar engaged as an interference fit with the pushrod adjacent its end remote from the operating component, a first resilient means acting between the push rod and the support to urge the push rod to said rest position, second stop means limiting movement of the drive collar in a direction opposite the direction in which the pushrod is urged by said first resilient means, a knob slidably engaged with said drive collar, first abutment means on the knob and the drive collar limiting movement of the knob relative to the collar in a direction opposite that in which the push rod is urged by said first resilient means, second resilient means acting between the support and the knob to bias the knob in the same direction as the push rod is biassed by said first resilient means, and second abutment means limiting movement of the knob. relative to the support under the action of said second resilient means. When an operating assembly of the kind specified in the preceding paragraph is in a rest condition, immediately after assembly, the operating component and the push rod will be in their rest position under the action of the first resilient means and the first stop means.The knob will also be in a rest position under the action of the second resilient means and the second abutment means. The first abutment means may not be operative.In order to adjust the operating movement of the push rod and operating component in relation to the permitted movement of the knob all that is necessary is to mount the assembly in a jig which includes a stop member against which the operating component will abut after being moved relative to the support through the appropriate required distance. The method of setting requires the knob to be pushed against the action of the second resilient means whereupon initially, if the first abutment means is not operative the knob will slide relative to the drive collar until the first abutment means becomes operative. Thereafter, the drive collar, the push rod and the operating component will be moved with the knob against the action of the first and second resilient means until such time that the operating component abuts the stop member of the jig.Thereafter, continued movement of the knob against the action of the first resilient means will move the drive collar relative to the push rod, sufficient force being applied to overcome the interference fit between the drive collar and the push rod, until the second stop means is operative to limit movement of the drive collar, and thus the knob relative to the support. The assembly is then set, and can be removed from the jig for assembly into a pushbutton mechanism. It will be recognised therefore that the setting operation is extremely simple and can be performed without any skill whatsoever. More over, it will be recognised that if a pulling force is applied to the knob the pulling force can never be transmitted to the push rod since the first abutment means between the knob and the drive collar is only operative in the opposite direction.Thus a pulling force applied to the knob can never result in the operating component being stripped from the push rod. Preferably the first resilient means is a helical compression spring and acts between the drive collar and the support. Desirably the second stop means is defined by the helical compression spring, at a point in the compression of the spring wherein the spring becomes solid. includes Desirably the support 1 an elongate tube through which the push rod extends, and the knob is slidably received on the exterior of the tube. Preferably the knob is in two parts, a sleeve and a cap, the sleeve being slidable on the support and the cap being engageable with the sleeve as a snap fit and co operating with the drive collar, The accompanying drawing is a part sectional composite view of a pushbutton switch operating assembly, showing in the upper half of the figure the parts in an operated condition, and in the lower half of the figure the parts in their rest position. Referring to the drawing, the assembly includes a metal tube 11 through which extends a brass push rod 12.The push rod 12 is freely slidable within the tube 11 and at one end carries a molded synthetic resin block 13 forming part of a switching mechanism operating component.The block 13 can abut one end of the tube 11. At its opposite end the push rod 12 projects from the tube 11, and carries a molded synthetic resin drive collar 14.The drive collar 14 is engaged on the push rod 12 as an interference fit, that is to say there is no mechanical connection such as a Screw thread, or re enterant formation, the collar being atight fit on the cylindrical surface of the push rod and remaining thereon by virtue of friction. As will become more apparent hereinafter the fit of the collar 14 on the push rod 12 is of importance. A helical compression spring 15 acts between one end of the drive collar 14 and a washer 16 secured to the end of the tube 11. The spring 15 urges the collar 14, the push rod 15 and the component 13 to a rest position relative to the tube 11, the rest position being defined by abutment of the block 13 with the end of the tube 11 remote from the washer 16.The spring 15 does not exert sufficient force on the drive collar 14 to move the drive collar 14 relative to the push rod 12, nor to move the push rod 12 relative to the block 13. The drive collar 14 is formed externally with a peripheral shoulder 17 parallel to the washer 16 and facing away from the washer 16. A molded synthetic resin knob is slidably mounted on the tube 11, the knob including a sleeve 18 shown in broken lines and a cap 19 engageable with the sleeve 18 as a snap fit. The sleeve 18 is engaged with the outer surface of the tube 11 for rectilinear sliding movement thereon and the cap 19 closes the open end of the sleeve 18. The cap 19 is formed internally with an integral hollow spigot 21 within which the drive collar 14 and the end of the push rod 12 are received as a sliding fit.The spigot 21 is formed internally with a shoulder 22 against which the shoulder 17 of the drive collar 14 can abut. A second helical compression spring 23 acts between a molded member 24 secured to the tube 11 within the sleeve 18 and the cap 19. The sleeve 18 is formed internally with an abutment surface which engages the member 24 under the action of the spring 23 to define a rest position of the knob 18, 19 relative to the tube 11. The assembly is constructed in the following manner.The washer 16 and member 24 are secured to the tube 11, and the sleeve 18 of the knob is then threaded onto the tube 11 from the end thereof remote from the washer 16.A further molded component 25 is then engaged with the end of the tube 11 remote from the washer 16 to prevent removal of the sleeve 18 from the tube 11. The sleeve 18 is slidable at this stage relative to the tube 11 between limits defined by engagement of the sleeve 18 with the member 25 in one direction, and in the other direction by abutment of an internal surface of the sleeve 18 with part of the member 24. The push rod 12 is then moved until the block 13 abuts the end of the tube 11, and at the spring 15 is then threaded over the projecting end of the push rod 12. While holding the push rod in its projecting position the drive collar 14 is then pressfitted onto the push rod 12.The spring 23 is then positioned over the push rod and the drive collar, and the cap 19 is assembled to the sleeve 18 with the drive collar 14 entering the spigot 21 of the cap. As mentioned previously the cap 19 is a snap fit with the sleeve 18.The attachment of the cap 19 to the sleeve 18 completes the assembly sequence, and the assembly is then ready for adjustment to ensure that within the range of movement of the knob 18, 19 relative to the tube 11 the block 13 will move through a distance appropriate to operate the switching mechanism with which the assembly is to be associated.Thus the assembly is engaged in a simple jig which grips the tube 11, and which includes a stop member against which the block 13 abuts after movement through a predetermined distance from its rest position. Initially of course after assembly, but before adjustment the parts will be in rest positions defined by engagement of the block 13 with the end of the tube 11, under the action of the spring 15, and engagement of the internal abutment surface of the sleeve 18 with the member 24 under the action of the spring 23. After introduction of the assembly into the jig the knob 18, 19 is pushed against the action of the spring 23. Initial movement of the knob may not result in movement of the push rod 12, since in all probability there will, in the rest position of the component, be a gap between the shoulder 22 of the spigot 21 and the shoulder 17 of the drive collar 14.Thus initial movement of the knob 18, 19 against the action of the spring 23 will bring the shoulder 22 into abutment with the shoulder 17, and thereafter the drive collar 14, the push rod 12, and the block 13 will move with the knob 18, 19 against the combined action of the springs 23, 15.The push rod 12, drive collar 14 and block 13 will move until the block 13 abuts the stop member of the jig, whereupon the block 13 and push rod 12 will be incapable of further movement. However, continued movement of the knoo 18, 19 will result in movement of the drive collar 14 relative to the push rod 12. Thus a significant amount of force must be applied to the knob 18, 19 to move the drive collar 14 relative to the push rod 12, it being recalled that the collar 14 is an interference fit on the push rod 12. The knob 18, 19 is moved, carrying the collar 14 with it, until the spring 15 is fully collapsed, and becomes a solid spacer between the washer 16 and the drive collar 14. Thereafter no further movement of the knob 18, 19 against the action of the spring 23 is possible.Thus after assembly the movement of the knob 18, 19 towards the member 25 is limited not by engagement of the sleeve 18 with the member 25, but by total collapse of the spring 15. This completes the setting of the assembly, and it will be recognised that setting is, by virtue of the construction incorporating the drive collar 14, an extremely simple and rapid procedure. Indeed, the setting could be performed automatically, by a machine which applies an axial loading to the cap 19, the maximum axial loading applied by the machine being calculated to overcome the effect of the interference fit between the drive collar 14 and the push rod 12, but being insufficient to cause any damage to the assembly when the spring 15 is fully collapsed. Upon removal of the assembly from the jig the parts returned to their rest configurations under the action of the springs 15, 23. Thus the push rod 12, drive collar 14 and block 13 return to a rest postion defined by engagement of the block 13 with the end of the tube 11 under the action of the spring 15, and the knob 18, 19 returns to a rest position under the action of the spring 23, defined by engagement of the internal abutment of the sleeve 18 with the member 24. In the rest position of the knob and the push rod 12 a gap between the shoulder 17 of the drive collar 14 and the shoulder 22 of the spigot 21 may be re established. It will be recognised that force can only be transmitted from the knob to the push rod by movement of the knob in a direction towards the member 25. Movement of the knob in the opposite direction does not transmit any force to the push rod since the spigot 21 will slide relative to the collar 14. Thus there can be no possibility of a pull force applied to the knob damaging the connection between the block 13 and the push rod 12. As mentioned previously the drawing shows the components in two positions. The upper half of the drawing shows the component in an operated condition after setting, and the lower half of the drawing shows the parts in their rest positions. The assembly illustrated in the drawing and described above is primarily intended for use in a switch assembly of a road vehicle. The member 25 couples the lever 18 to various switching mechanisms of the switch assembly, these switching mechanisms being operated by movement of the tube 11. The block 13 forms part of the operating component of a pushbutton switch, the switching mechanism of which is within the housing containing the other switching mechanisms of the switch assembly. The pushbutton switch is operated by moving the knob 18, 19 against the action of the springs 15, 23. While the foregoing example is an operating assembly for a pushbutton switch, it is to be recognised that a similar principle can be applied to other pushbutton mechanism operating assemblies, for example certain mechanical components such as bistable mechanisms, changeover valves and the like can be operated mechanically by pushbutton arrangements, and similar operating assemblies to the one disclosed above, but of course modified in shape where necessary, could be utilized.
