# IMPROVED PLASTIC CONTAINER AND METHOD OF FORMING SAME

## Abstract
This relates to blow molded containers, and particularly to the formation of blow molded containers formed of a plastic material which is subjectable to a high degree of biaxial orientation for maximum strength. At least two containers are formed in each blow molding operation with each container having throughout the stress areas thereof a high degree of biaxial orientation. A container may be in the form of a bottle having an as formed open bottom which is closed by a metal end unit seamed in place. On the other hand, the intermediately formed article may be in the form of a plurality of hollow containers arranged in circumferentially adjacent relation and directly secured to each other and to the bottom and top panels. Other containers will have open mouths closed by conventional closures including metal end units which are seamed to the container body or by closure caps which may be releasably interlocked with the neck finish of the container in several known modes. In every instance the containers are formed with a minimum of scrap.
