# Displacement polynucleotide assay method and polynucleotide complex reagent therefor.

## Abstract
A diagnostic reagent is disclosed containing a complex of a probe polynucleotide P bound via purine pyrimidine hydrogen bonding to a labeled polynucleotide L . The probe P contains a target binding region TBR capable of binding to a target nucleotide sequence G of a bioiogical sample. A method is disclosed in which contact with a sample contain ing the target nucleotide sequence G causes binding, initially between G and a single stranded portion IBR of the target binding region TBR . Thereafter the labeled polynuc leotide L is displaced from the complex by branch migra tion of G into the P L binding region. Determination of displaced labeled polynucleotide L gives a value which is a function of the presence and concentration of target nuc leotide sequence G in the sample.
