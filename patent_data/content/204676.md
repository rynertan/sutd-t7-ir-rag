# Panoramic tomography X ray apparatus particularly for dental photography.

## Abstract
A panoramic tomography X ray apparatus, which com prises a fixed frame 30 , to which another frame rotary frame 11 , having an X ray tube 10 at one end and a film cartridge device 20 for X ray film RF at the other end, is suspended, The apparatus has a drive mechanism for turning the rotary frame 11 in the horizontal plane for taking a panor amic X ray photograph. In the drive mechanism there is a drive and guide groove 31 , which has straight side sections 31S and a curved section 31R connecting the side sections together. The drive unit 33 of the apparatus comprises a drive wheel 40 which, when rotated by the drive unit 33 , turns said rotary frame 11 . The rotary frame 11 is sus pended to the fixed frame 30 by means of a crank mechan ism 13, 50, 51 which is jointed to the rotary frame 11 and to the fixed frame 30 with bearings 12a, 12b 53a, 53b . The drive and guide mechanism 33 41 and the crank mechanism interact in such a way that, in the front area of the dental arch, i.e. when the corresponding section 31R of the guide and drive groove 31 is in operation, the rotary frame 11 turns around the front journal pin 51 of the crank 50 , and in the side areas, when guided by the straight sections 31S of the drive and guide groove 31 , the rotary frame 11 simula taneously turns around both journal pins 13, 51 of the crank mechanism 13, 50, 51 .
