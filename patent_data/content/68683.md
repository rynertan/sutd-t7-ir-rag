# Slack rope detecting apparatus.

## Abstract
A slack rope detecting apparatus for use in mine winding operations provides a trip signal via contacts 34 if the load in the rope falls below a predetermined value. The apparatus senses the load at each side of a sheave wheel using transducers 6 and 8 and uses a mean value of their outputs as an input to a summation amplifier 12. The weight of the rope between the sheave wheel is compensated for by monitoring rotation of the winding engine drum 42 and providing corresponding input signals for the amplifier 12. When the effective load in the rope falls below a predetermined value, set by input 28, a trip signal is produced. The trip signal output is preferably visually displayed and recorded.
