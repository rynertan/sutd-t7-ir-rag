## Abstract
Apparatus for compacting powdered and fibrous raw materials to a pellet product, comprising a mixing chamber 1 with an inlet 2 , a driven mixing shaft 10 coaxially with respect to the mixing chamber 1 and which is provided with radially projecting blades 26 . A pelletizer 8 is connected directly to the mixing chamber 1 and comprises a cylindric al mould 22 coaxially inside a cylindrical jacket part 9 and provided with radial holes 23 , and inside which are arranged one or more freely rotatable pressure rollers 17 as a result of which, when the apparatus is working, the compacted mixture is pressed through the holes 23 , while the jacket part 9 of the pelletizer 8 is provided with an outlet for the compressed product 25 . According to the invention the mixing shaft 10 is designed as a hollow cylinder, rotatable coaxially with respect to a fixed support ing shaft 6 . Preferably blades 26 carried by the hollow mixing cylinder 10 each consist of two plate parts 27, 28 which have a common edge 29 extending in the direction of displacement of material in the mixing chamber and at either side are positioned at an angle to the direction of the shaft and the direction of rotation of the drive is reversible, so that the mixing chamber 1 at the end adjoining the pelletizer 8 is provided with a closable discharge opening, 37 the materials mixed and compacted can be either pelletized or discharged before pelletizing.
