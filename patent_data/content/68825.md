## Description
JAW ASSEFELY DAVING A JAW USABLE WITU A CiCK Background of the InventionField of the Invention The invention relates to jaw assemblies for chucks and, more particularly though not exclusively, to jaw assemblies having soft jaws for self centering chucks for use on lathes, soft jaws being a term used to refer to jaws of a metal such as mild steel which is softer than a workpiece to be held.Description of the Prior Art A chuck is used to mount a workpiece for turning on a lathe. A common form of chuck is one which has a number of jaws which can be adjusted radially inwardly or outwardly to clamp a workpiece. Self centering chucks have usually three jaws which ere commonly arranged to advance concentrically by means of a scroll, although other means of advancement may be used. Self centering chucks are used whenever possible, therefore, since a lathe operator needs a minimum of time and skill in setting up a fresh workpiece for machinery. Furthermore, it is common for the soft jaws of a chuck on a lathe to be modified by machining in such 2 way as to suit a particular batch of components to be machined, and repetition of such machining operations will rapidly wear away the soft jaws. It has been proposed to secure blocks of metal, for example by welding, onto the soft jaws of a chuck in order either to effect 2 repair to the soft jaws or to enable the jaws to accommodate a special batch of workSuch modifications involve undesirable machine downtime, and where welding is concerned, can only be carried out a limited nzmbeX of times before the soft jaws have to be replacedFurthermore, no advantage can be gained from carrying out such modifications in terms of improving the versatility of the chuck for handling a variety of workpiecesSummary of the Invention According to the present invention there is provided a set of jaw assemblies for a chuck for holding a workpiece, each jaw assembly comprising a jaw, adapter means mountable on the jaw in a plurality of different orientations, and means for securing each adapter means to the associated jaw in a selected one of .aid plurality of different olrie atio s, the arrangement being such that, in use in a chuck, a workpiece may be clamped between the adapter means of the jaws. Means may be provided for registering each adapter means on the associated jaw in a selected one of the quality of different orientations. The registering means may comprise a locating tongue on one of each adapter means or the associated jaw, and a plurality of slots on respectively the other of each adapter means or the associated jaw, the locating tongue being engageable in any one of the plurality of slots. The locating tongues are preferably provided on the jaws and the slots are preferably provided on the adapter means. Each adapter means may comprise three elongate slots, each adapter means being mountable on the associated jaw in six different orientations. Alternatively, the registering means may comprise a plurality of holes in adapter means, a hole in the associated jaw and pin means engageable in the hole in the jaw and one of said plurality of holes in the adapter means. The means for securing each adapter means on the associated jaw may comprise a threaded bolt. Each adatper means may comprise a block of regular cross section and the block is preferably of hexagonal cross section. The invention further provides a chuck for a lathe comprising a set of jaws according to the invention. The invention, and its objects and advantages, will become more apparent in the detailed description of the preferred embodiments hereinafter presented.Brief Description of the Drawings One embodiment of jaw assemblies having soft jaws according to the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a side view of one embodiment of a soft jaw according to the invention Figure 2 is an end view of the soft jaw shown inFigure 1 Figure 3 is an underneath plan view of one embodiment of an adapter block for a soft jaw according to the invention Figure d is a side view of the adapter block shown in Figure 3 Figure 5 is an exploded view of a jaw assembly combining the soft jaw and the adapter block shown in Figures 1 to 4 and Figure 6 shows diagrammatically a self centering chuck comprising a set of jaw assemblies having jaws and blocks according to the inventionDescription of the Preferred Embodiments Because chucks with soft jaws are well known, the present description will be directed in particular to elements forming part of, or cooperating more directly with, the present invention. Elements not specifically shown or described herein are understood to be selectable from those known in the art. Figures 1 and 2 show a soft jaw 30 for a selfcentering, or scroll chuck. The jaw 30 is made of mild steel and has a pair of longitudinal grooves 10, each extend ing over the length of each flank 11 of the jaw. On the under side of the jaw 30 is machined a set of sguare profile teeth 12. The jaw 30 shown in this embodiment is for slideably mounting in a radial slot in a scroll chuck. The radial slot in the chuck is provided with a pair of elongate ribs, each of which complementarily engages each of the grooves 10 in the jaw. Rotatably mounted in the chuck is a plate having a raised spiral or scroll machined on it, and the set of teeth 12 on the jaw meshingly engages with the scroll of the chuck. The scroll can be located in the chuck by means of a key, thus moving the jaw radially inwardly or outwardly on the chuck. The top side of the jaw 30 is machined to form a locating tongue 13, a load bearing surface 16 and a seating surface 14. A hole 15 is drilled down into the jaw 30 through the locating tongue 13, and the jaw 30 is tapped to receive a threaded bolt. An adapter block 40, as shown in Figures 3 and 4, is shaped to fit onto the machined part of the jaw shown inFigures 1 and 2. The illustrated embodiment of the adapter block 40 is of regular hexagonal cross section and is made conveniently from standard hexagonal mild steel bar. Three slots 17 are dimensioned so that each slot fits snugly over the locating tongue 13 of the jaw. The e .ots 17 are arranged in alignment with opposing corners of the block, and in these regions, the bottom surface of the block is machined to form six lands 22. These lands 22 lie perpendicular to their respective slots 17 and are intended to abut the load bearing surface 16 of the jaw 30 when the parts are assembled. A clearance hole 23 for the shank of a threaded bolt is drilled through the axis of the block 0, and an upper portion of the hole is conveniently counterbored at 2 to accept the head of a cap screw. Wrnen the parts are assembled, the holes in the respective parts line up so that a cap screw can be tightened down to fasten the parts together. Three of the corners of the block 40 showy in this emm30riDent have been specially machined to form part circular recesses 19, 20 and 21. The purpose of these recesses will become clearer with reference to Figures 5 and 6. Figure 5 shows how the block 40 is assembled onto the jaw 30 in this embodiment of a jaw assembly 50 according to the present invention. One of the grooves 17 in the block 40 registers on the locating tongue 13 of the jaw 30, and a cap screw 25 is used to secure the parts together.The bottom surface 18 of the block 40 is clamped down onto the seating surface 14 of the jaw 30 by tightening up the respective cap screws. It will be apparent that there are six possible ways of arranging the block 40 on the jaw 30.In each case, the block 40 is positively registered and can be securely fastened on the jaw 30, and the design is such that in each case, one corner of the block projects forwardly of the front endface of the jaw 30. The reason for this sTill be apparent from the description relating to Figure 6. Figure 6 shows a set of three jaws 30 and blocks 40 of this embodiment of the invention mounted on a scroll chuck. Each block 40 has been arranged on its respective jaw such that the operative corner of each block has an identical part circular recess, in this case, 20. When the scroll indicated diagrammatically by a cnain aotted spiral 25 is rotated by means of a key, the jaws advance concentrically to clamp a workpiece in the recesses 20 in the blocks 40. To change over the blocks from one job to the next, each cap screw is loosened to enable the blocks to be lifted and turned to their new stations, where the cap screws are once again tightened down to fasten the blocks onto the jaws in their appropriate positions. It will be apparent also from Figure 6 that the jaws of the chuck are capable of clamping very small components between the blocks. It will be appreciated that, in contrast to the previously described embodiment, the tongue may be provided on the jaw. It will also be appreciated that means other than tongues and slots may be provided for registering the block on the jaw. For example, the block may have six holes arranged in a pitched circle around the central bolt hole, in which case the jaw may have a single hole for receiving a dowel pin in one of the six holes. Alternatively1 two tapped holes may be provided in the jaw for receiving a pair of threaded bolts through any one pair of six angularly spaced pairs of clearance holes provided in a pitched circle around the axis of the block. It will further be appreciated that the blocks for mounting on the jaws of a chuck need not necessarily be of hexagonal cross section, and that suitably shaped blocks may egually well be provided for either self centering or independent chucks having more or less than three jaws. In addition, the jaws of chucks which are available as standard parts may be modified in order to accept any of the blocks described above, and it is not essential that the jaws of a chuck thus modified should be removable from the chuck. The advantages of this embodiment of jaws according to the invention are that considerable expense is saved because the time taken for changing over from one job to the next is minimized. Up to six different recesses may be machined in the block in order to accomodate six special machining jobs, and this considerably reduces the need for large stacks of spare parts. Previously, specific embodiments of the present invention have been described. It should be appreciated, however, that these embodiments have been described for the purposes of illustration only, without any intention of limiting the scope of the present invention. Rather, it is the intention that the present invention be limited only by the appended claims.
