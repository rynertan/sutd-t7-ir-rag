## Description
The present invention relates to composite springs and, more particularly, to composite springs made up of natural rubber or other elastomer in combination with a coil spring or other reinforcement. As used herein, the term stiff refers to those portions of the force versus deflection curve of the composite spring that are of relatively high spring rate, whether constant slope or generally rising rate and is characteristic of progressively increasing resistance to compressive deformation. The term soft refers to and is characteristic of relatively lower spring rate or less resistance to compressive deformation, whether increasing, decreasing or none at all. In the past, composite springs of this type have provided force deflection curves in which the spring is soft near the middle of the curve and is stiff at each end. This result is obtained by controlling deformation of the elastomer spring element under certain conditions in which it is deformable according to different but essentially stable characteristics. One example of such a composite spring is found in the United States Patent 2,605,099 by Brown. This composite spring is made up of a rubber envelope that has an undulatory wall section reinforced by and bonded to a steel spring. Another generally similar composite spring is found in United States Patent 2,822,165 by Boschi. Other references of note are Japanese Patent No. 52 24676 to Ozaki. This patent discloses a composite spring, comprising a coil spring embedded in a tubular elastomeric body. The elastomeric body of said composite spring has an outer wall having a generally straight sided longitudinal profife and, under zero columnar deflection of the coil spring, a matching inner surface. The coil spring, embedded in said composite spring for controlling the compressive deformation, is located closer to said inner wall than to said outer wall and the stability factor S of the composite spring is such that wherein 1 t h 0,5 and 0,5 S 0,25, and where The principle drawback of these composite springs is that the soft region of the force deflection curve, if any, is of very limited duration. This is unsatisfactory in some applications in which it is desirable to have a soft region of extended duration. One such application is for vehicular suspension systems and, in particular, suspension systems for automotive vehicles. This is so because ride comfort often is associated with the ride characteristics that are derived from the soft region of the force deflection curve of the suspension springs. Herein disclosed is is between 0.05 and 0.8 5 and such that is between 0.05 and 3 E. More succinctly, the present invention provides a spring comprising an elongated tubular elastomeric body and means operatively associated with the body for controlling deformation of the body such that a symmetric bulging instability occurs sequentially at a plurality of locations spaced apart along the length of the body under a predetermined axial load condition. Thus, the present invention provides a composite spring having a force deflection curve with a soft region of extended duration a force deflection curve which is controllable to provide selected stiff and soft regions in accordance with specific requirements, particularly the provision of soft load bearing characteristics over an extended deflection range at a predetermined load and a composite spring that is tunable so that it can be adapted easily to the force, deflection and other requirements of specific applications. The features, objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from detailed description and the claims to follow, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which like parts bear like reference numerals. Referring to Fig. 2, one presently preferred embodiment of the composite spring of this invention is comprised of a tubular elastomeric body 10 and reinforcement means in the form of a coil spring 12 embedded in and bonded to the body for controlling deformation of the body such that the spring s force deflection curve has two stiff regions, each characterized by essentially stable compression of the body, and an intermediate soft region characterized by unstable but symmetric bulging of the body. Referring to Fig. 1, a typical force deflection curve such as that just described includes a lower stiff region 14 in which stiffness is proportional to the shear modulus of the material forming body 10. In this region, essentially only uniaxial compression of the body occurs, giving rise to a generally constant slope curve approximating a linear spring rate. The force deflection curve further includes an upper stiff region 16 in which stiffness is proportional to the shear modulus, but also is influenced by other factors, as will be described. In this region the body is under compression but, unlike region 14, the spring rate is of rising rate. In both regions 14 and 16, however, the body is deformed under conditions of essentially stable compression. This invention stems from the discovery that, by causing instead of preventing instability, an intermediate soft region 18 Fig. 1 of extended duration may be obtained, provided the instability is controlled so that it is localized and symmetric that is, so that the body does not undergo columnar or other asymmetric buckling. The terms symmetric and asymmetric have as a reference the longitudinal axis of the body 10 . This control is accomplished by the coil spring 12. Being embedded in and bonded to the body 10 this spring restrains the cylindrical body wall from bulging along a helical path 19 Figs. 3 and 4 that coincides with the individual coils of spring 2. The body is free to bulge laterally, however, in the axial spaces between adjacent convolutions of path 19 body or between the individual coils of spring 12 at the intervals corresponding to the pitch of spring 12. Thus, the composite spring appears as a rubber coil spring, in which each individual coil is formed by one of these lateral bulges. In its undeflected state, the composite spring of this invention has a simple cylindrical wall form that appears rectilinear in longitudinal section, as shown Fig. 2 . As a columnar or axial load is applied to body 10, uniaxial compression occurs until the body has been deflected about twenty percent of its unloaded length, or about 0.2H Fig. 1 . It is at this deflection that local symmetric bulging instability begins to appear in sequence between adjacent coils of spring 12. The force deflection curve has by now progressed upward along and through region 14 and is entering region 18. As depicted in Figs. 1 and 3, as deflection continues beyond about 0.2H, this symmetric bulging instability appears as lateral outward bulging between adjacent coils of spring 12, first near the middle of body 10, as shown Fig. 3 and subsequently between other adjacent coils. As a consequence, the external surface of the composite spring increasingly acquires an undulatory configuration. The duration of region 18 corresponds to the range of deflection during which the symmetric bulging instability grows toward and eventually assumes a continuous coil configuration, as shown Fig. 4 . With continued deflection beyond about 0.6H, adjacent undulations contact and bottom out upon one another, as depicted in Fig. 4, and further growth of the bulging instability essentially ceases. Continued deflection therefore produces further compression of the body along region 16 of the force deflection curve Fig. 1 under conditions of uniaxial compression similar to region 14, except that further bottoming of the adjacent undulations produces an increasing effective shape factor and hence a rising instead of linear spring rate. An important aspect of the present invention is that the composite spring performance is the result of the cumulative effects of the individual rubber coils that is, the segments of the body between adjacent active coils of spring 12. In the single intracoil body segment depicted in Fig. 5, the localized effects of axial compression appear as both inward and outward bulging of its inner wall 40 and its outer wall 50, respectively. As depicted by broken lines, the magnitude of the inward bulging of wall 40 is substantially less than that of the outward bulging of wall 50 under axial load conditions. The inner and outer circumferential or hoop strains in and adjacent to walls 40 and 50 cause the relatively incompressible material forming the body segment to flow radially outward, producing the intracoil lateral bulging and the overall appearance of a rubber coil spring as illustrated in Figs. 2 4. These strains become increasingly positive with increases in axial compression, and are distributed axially along the bulging surface such that the maximum strain appears about midway between adjacent coils of spring 12 and are zero adjacent the coils themselves. The flow obtained as a result of this strain distribution causes the body segment to deflect momentarily in an unstable manner as if it were buckling. This may be understood by reference to the force deflection behavior of each of the Fig. 5 intracoil body segments or rubber coils , first individually and then cumulatively. Individually, each rubber coil has a force deflection curve that resembles that of the composite spring, except that, as depicted in Fig. 6, the curve has a region 60 of negative slope. This is indicative of the occurrence of symmetric bulging instability within the rubber coil. Cumulatively, the bulging instability commences with the rubber coils near the middle of the body, and proceeds toward the ends of the body in alternate sequence. This is depicted in Fig. 3, in which bulging instability between coils 22 and 24 is illustrated as being the first to occur, and will be followed by similar instability occurrences between coils 21, 22 or 24, 26 as the case may be. Consequently, the rubber coils tend to reach the point of symmetric bulging instability sequentially, so the cumulative effects of coil instability occurrences appear as a plurality of the Fig. 6 force deflection curves. As depicted in Fig. 7, the force deflection curve for the composite spring therefore appears as a superposition of multiple Fig. 6. force deflection curves, from which an average force deflection curve 64 for the composite spring may be derived. In making this derivation, the negative slope regions of the individual rubber coils are offset by contrary effects of the other rubber coils that are not then manifesting this mode of deflection. Curve 64 therefore has a plateau like region that corresponds to region 18 of the Fig. 1 curve. Referring again to Fig. 1, this plateau like region may occur at a predetermined load condition, as depicted by curves A, B and C. The manner in which this is accomplished is described presently. As will be apparent from Fig. 1, the slope of this region, whether positive, zero or even negative, may vary, depending upon the load condition at which the instability yielding the soft spring behavior occurs and other factors. As a consequence, the actual axial deflection force present during the occurrence of the instability may in some cases vary in accordance with the point along region 18 selected as the spring design load, or the load level from which the spring is subjected to positive and negative load inputs under the expected service conditions. The selection of this design load will of course depend upon specific application. For example, in most vehicular suspension applications, it should be desirable to select a design load at point 66 Fig. 1 , corresponding to the onset of region 18, to yield a soft ride over the maximum available range of suspension deflections. The degree of softness and the extent to which it may be desired to introduce some stiffness within or bounding this deflection range is controllable by tuning the spring according to further principles of this invention. The occurrence of symmetric bulging instability is controllable so that the composite spring may be tuned such that its soft region 18 Fig. 1 appears when and for the duration desired. Among the factors that lend to this control are wall thickness and length of the body the size, number, location, and spacing of the coils of spring 12 the properties of the material of which the body is composed and other factors that will become apparent from the description and claims to follow. The thickness of the body wall relative to coil spacing influences the occurrence of bulging instabilities, the thinner the wall for a given coil spacing the greater the tendency for the body to bulge. It is preferred that the bulging instability occurs in a predictable sequence in order to control the offsetting effects of the Fig. 5 individual intracoil body segments. It is further preferred that the bulging instability occurs first at or near the middle of the body and progress toward its ends from there. To accomplish this end, the body wall should be thinner at the middle of the body and become progressively thicker proceeding toward its ends. It is further preferred that the bulging instability protrudes outwardly between the spring coils, rather than inward to prevent or minimize undesirable surface stresses. To maximize the tendency toward such outward bulging, spring 12 should be embedded within body 10 nearer wall 40. The number of active coils, coil diameter, and length of the body all are additional stability factors Active coils mean all but the end coils, which constitute inactive coils. As depicted in Fig. 2, the active coils are designated by reference numerals 21, 22, 24 and 26 and the inactive coils are designated by reference numerals 28 and 30. For example, the greater the number of active coils or greater the spacing between coils, the greater the tendency of the body as a whole to buckle asymmetrically under columnar loading. If the number of active coils is excessive, the body is in essence divided into so many of the Fig. 5 intracoil body that it tends to shift into asymmetric deformation conditions unpredictably. Too few active coils engendered by excessive intracoil spacing, on the other hand, promotes asymmetric buckling within the individual segments. The wire diameter or cross sectional size of the individual coils of spring 12 is still another stability factor. In the absence of sufficient reinforcement due to inadequate coil diameter, the body tends towards asymmetric buckling, depending upon its length, in accordance with well known principles of columnar loading. If its individual coils are too large in diameter, however, spring 12 assumes a greater proportion of the load carrying capacity as depicted by curve 20 in Fig. 1, and the beneficial effects of elastomer loading are correspondingly sacrificed. The individual coils should not be exposed and therefore preferably are of a maximum diameter that is somewhat less than the thickness of the body wall. In many practical cases, however, the individual coil diameter will be substantially less than this wall thickness. These considerations may be expressed as follows Where as depicted in Fig. 1 Preferably the stability factor s set forth in 1 above is between about 0.03 and 0.8 and most preferably is between about 0.05 and 0.2. Preferably the reinforcement efficiency factor E set forth in 2 above is between about .03 and 5 and most preferably is between about .05 and 3. In addition to the foregoing, unacceptable instabilities are likely to occur whenever the ratio R 2H is less than about 0.1. It is possible to control the point along the Fig. 1 vertical force axis at which region 18 will occur, in accordance with the material properties or wall thickness of body 10, or both. For a given spring construction, an increase or decrease in the hardness or shear modulus of the body material should produce a corresponding variation in region 18 up and down along the force axis. Referring to Fig. 1, curves A, B, and C respectively represent the effects of progressive increases in shear modulus of the body material used. Likewise, for a given shear modulus or material hardness, a similar variation is attainable by increasing or decreasing the wall thickness R r of body 10 Fig. 2 . As a consequence, the composite spring may be constructed with a predetermined design load at which region 18 and its associated softness will occur. Variations in regions 14, 16 and 18 may also be achieved by adjusting the number of active coils within the limits set by 1 and 2 above, or by adjusting the pitch of spring 12, or both. This is particularly advantageous in vehicular suspension applications in which it is desirable to tune the suspension spring elements to provide soft ride effects at a certain design load. It presently is preferred to form body 10 of natural rubber compounded with the usual ingredients to produce an engineering grade of vulcanized rubber, although suitable synthetic elastomers or blends of natural rubber with synthetic elastomers may be used. In addition to acting as the primary load bearing material, the rubber provides attenuation of vibration or shock transmitted from the unsprung mass to the sprung mass by means of both isolation and damping. Natural frequency is reduced by decreasing the spring stiffness for a constant sprung mass or by increasing the sprung mass at constant stiffness. With the rubber coil spring of the present invention, the static and dynamic stiffness at design load is low and the natural frequency is also low, with corresponding good vibration attenuation. The rubber coil spring provides increasingly effective isolation of the sprung mass from disturbances applied at frequencies above the natural frequency of the spring mass system, such that, as its resilience is increased, vibration attenuation is reduced. The rubber coil spring has the further advantages of being much less susceptible to the transmission of higher order harmonics than an all metal spring, providing inherent damping that, in most practical applications, is substantially greater than that of an all metal spring and reducing the effects of any resonance conditions that occur when a disturbing frequency at the natural frequency of the spring mass system is encountered. It is a well known consequence of increasing the inherent damping of the rubber compound that the set remaining after the removal of a compression load will increase, as will the creep under load. These effects could lead in a particular application to a gradual reduction in the length of the spring and hence in the height of the sprung mass for example, they could affect bumper height in certain vehicle suspension applications. These effects may be controlled and kept within acceptable limits, however, by precompressing the rubber coil spring prior to installation. It is well known that physical creep rates in rubber are approximately constant with the logarithm of time typically involved with most practical vehicle suspension applications. Thus, the effects of creep may be minimized or eliminated simply by providing precompression or prestressing of a rubber coil spring unit for a period of time calculated to compensate for the amount of creep anticipated for the service life of the spring. It presently is preferred to use the coil spring 12 as the reinforcement between which the localized bulging instability is formed, and to both embed the spring in and bond it to the rubber forming the body 10. Any suitable rubber bonding agent may be used to accomplish this. It will be recognized, however, that other types or forms of hoop like restraints such as tire cord or fibers arranged in a spiral pattern generally could be used in place of or in combination with spring 12. Another possible construction is to bond separate rings together in a stacked relationship, with appropriate dividers bonded between them to promote lateral bulging. Neither these rings nor body 10 need be of circular transverse cross section, and could be of oval, multi flat sided or other cross sections that yield acceptable deformation behavior in accordance with the general principles of this invention. The spring 12 itself preferably is of metallic composition, although it could be formed of reinforced fibers, plastic or other nonmetallic compositions having suitable structural properties. Likewise, it may not always be necessary to bond the spring to the rubber, or to embed it completely within the body wall, or both, provided the frictional and other mechanical and thermal effects associated with these variations in construction produce satisfactory results. The rubber coil spring as illustrated and described thus far is intended for axial columnar loading. As depicted in Fig. 1, the ends of body 10 are planar and transverse to its longitudinal axis. This composite spring therefore is suitable for axial columnar loading between parallel platens as shown in Fig. 70 and 72. It may, however, be adapted easily for loading by non parallel platens and even by one or more pivoted platens, as may be encountered for example in certain automotive suspension involving pivotal A arms or yokes. In these applications, the ends of the body may be formed at angles to its longitudinal axis, or the platens may be angled correspondingly, or both, provided the resultant force vector is along the longitudinal axis. This could accommodate the swinging motion of the sprung or unsprung mass, to the extent required to achieve the controlled symmetric bulging instabilities described earlier. It may also easily be adapted for use with non planar ends for example, with spring ends cut squre rather than ground flat, producing a step like end to the RSC which can locate into a suitable or fixture. To illustrate the foregoing principles of this invention, but not by way of limitation, the following example is disclosed. A rubber coil spring generally similar to that illustrated in Fig. 2, in which internal radius r is 41mm, outer radius R is 55mm, unrestrained length H of 300mm, five active coils, and formulated of natural rubber of 50 IRHD. The force deflection curve and design load for this spring is depicted in Fig. 8. This spring should yield generally soft ride characteristics in a vehicle suspension system.
