# METHOD FOR CULTURING CHONDROCYTES TO PRODUCE CULTURES AND METHOD FOR EXTRACTING ANTI INVASION FACTOR THEREFROM

## Abstract
Chondrocytes are cultured to produce cartilage tissue from which an anti invasion factor AIF may be recovered. Mammalian cartilage providing at least about 60 viable chondrocytes is enzymatically digested to denude the cells of their extracellular matrix. The denuded cells are plated at high density and cultured to produce cartilage tissue.
