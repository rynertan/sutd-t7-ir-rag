## Description
DEVICE FOR SENSING THE DIAMETER OF ORCHARD ANDHORTICULTURAL PRODUCE, FOR SELECTING LINES ON THEBASIS OF TEE ORGANOLECTIC CHARACTERISTICS OP THE PRODUCE This invention relates to a device for sensing the diameter of orchard and horticultural produce, for selecting lines on the basis of organolectic characteristics of the produce. Known is the need to select orchard and horticultural produce on the basis of stich characteristics as their size, color, and the like, after harvesting, such selection being effective to identify the various choices. That selection is currently performed, preferably automatically on suitable lines whereinto the harvested produce is distribated. However, known selecting lines are not generally capable of determining with accuracy the diameter of the orchard and horticaltural prodace, nor of operating at the required speed with sufficient delicacy to avoid damaging the produce. It is the aim of this invention to solve that problem, by providing a device which, when introduced in a selection line for orchard and horticultural produce, enables the diameter thereof to be accurately sensed. Within the above aim, it is a further object of the invention to provide a device for sensing the diameter of the orchard and horticultural produce of simple design, reliable and versatile in use, and of relatively economical cost. This aim and this obJect are both achieved, according to the present invention, by a device for sensing the diameter of orchard and horticultural prodnce, for selecting lines on the basis of organolectic characteristics of the produce, which is characterized in that it comprises roller conveyor means operative to move forward in an orderly row said orchard and horticultural produce, means operative to cause said produce to rotate on said conveyor means, a set of lighted microcells laid beside said conveyor means, distributed transversely to the direction of advancement thereof and adapted, on said orchard and hortfcultural produce moving past them, to be partly blanketed by the outline of said produce. The invention details will be more readily apparent from the detailed description of a preferred embodiment of the device for sensing the diameter of orchard and horticultural produce, as trated by way of example in the accompanying drawing, the one figure whereof shows a vertical cross section view of the device in question. With reference to that figure, the device for sensing the diameter of orchard and horticulturA produce comprises a so called singling device, effective to cause the orchard and horticiilttwal produce to be selected to move forward in an orderly row. That device includes in a substantially known manner, a roller conveyor 1 driven by a chain 2 which wraps around a vertical plane and has a horizontal upper rtm. mach link in the chain 2 has a pin 3 extending horizontally, transverse to the longitudinal extension of said chain 2. In at least one side of said pins 3 is a sleeve 4, mounted rotatably, in axial alignment with a pair of side by side rollers 5a,5b, having a symmetrically converging frustoconical profile. The sleeve 4 also defines a small coaxial wheel 6. The sleeve 4, rollers 5a,5b, and wheel 6 are preferably formed from a plastic material as a one piece constrction. The small wheel 6 is preferably in contact with a belt 7 which is rotatable along an annular path defining a vertical plane, said belt having a horizontal upper run, parallel to said horizontal upper run of said chain 2. Located above the roller conveyor 1, are a pair of small Juxtaposed walls 8a, 8b respectively, lateral to rollers 5at 5b. On one of those small walls, 8b in the drawn instance, there are arranged a set of lighted microcells 9 distributed vertically it is expediently contemplated that such lighted microcells 9 be orderly arranged in two vertical rows offset to each other such that each mi cro cell in one row occupies a vertically intermediate position to that of two contiguous iiicrocells in the flanking row. Between the rollers 5a, 5b and small walls 8a, 8b, moreover, there are symmetrically interposed guides 10a, lOb, substantially shaped to extend the taper of the rollers themselves. The device heretofore described operates as follows. In a known manner, the orchard and horti cultural produce to be selected is conveyed to the singler I so as to be distribted in an orderly row.Each fruit, in fact, arranges itself, as indicated at fl in the drawing, within the cavity defined between two adjacent pairs of rollers 5a, 5b. At the area where the small wheels 6 of the roller conveyor engage with the belt 7, which is driven at a different peripheral speed from the chain 2, the rollers 5a, Sb are imparted with an axial rotation, by virtue of the pivotal mount of the related sleeve 4 on the pin 3 which bonds them to the chain 2. The belt 7 ceases, in fact, the rotation of the small wheel 6 on the pin 3. Owing to that rotation, the fruit ii is also imparted with a rotation about an axis extending horizontally across the direction of advancement. On moving past the lighted microcells 9, whose beam is reflected from the opposed small wall 8a, the fruit II causes a partial blanketing thereof in varying extents according to the size of the fruit and adapted, therefore, to allow that size to be sensed. The concurrent axial rotation of the fruit 11 allows the entire periphery of the fruit to be scanned such as to sense, and suitably store, the maximum fruit diameter. It should be pointed out that, by providing two offset rows of lighted microcells 9, the detectable dimensions can be scanned almost continuously, thereby the measurement taken is highlg accurate. In practicing the invention, any materials, shapes and dimensions may be used according to requirements.
