Compounds having peripheral calcium antagonist, anticonvulsive and eumetabolic activity, processes for the preparation thereof and pharmaceutical compositions containing them The present invention relates to 1 4,4 difluoro benzhydryl 4 3,4 dimethoxycinnamyl piperazine of formula IEMI1.1 and pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof. Compound I exhibits potent peripheral calcium an tagonist, anticonvulsive and eumetabolic activities, together with a very low toxicity, and therefore it may be employed in the treatment of circulatory diseases, convulsions and cerebral circulatory diseases. According to the present invention, compound I may be used in therapy in form of the free base as well as in form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof with inorganic or organic acids. Among the salts, particularly preferred is the dihydrochloride which will be hereinafter called, for sake of shortness, also with the abbreviation PU 122. The present invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing as the active ingredient the compounds of the invention, optionally in admixture with suitable conventional excipients.Said pharmaceutical compositions may be administered orally, parenterally or rectally,using conventionally employed carriers, excipients, lubricants, emulsifiers, flavouring and colouring agents, etc. Compound I may be prepared by reacting 1 4,4 difluoro benzhydryl piperazine with a reactive derivative of 3,4 dimethoxycinnamic acid, such as its acyl halide, symmetric homogenous or mixed anhydri de and subsequently treating the resulting amide with a suitable reducing agent. Alternatively, compound I may be prepared by condensing l 4,4 difluoro benzhydryl piperazine on the cinnamoyl halide in the presence of an organic or inorganic base.

Moreover, PU 122 shows an interesting calcium antagonist activity, and a platelet antiaggregating activity higher than that of the acetylsalicylic acid. Cerebral perfusion in the rabbit The cerebral vasodilative activity of PU 122 in comparison with Flunarizine was tested by the method of the cerebral perfusion in the rabbit according to the procedure of Von P. Vaupel e H.Hutten 1980 , by measurement of the decrease of the peripheral resistances in the cerebral district. Said changement was determined by means of a transducer, by measuring the hematic pressure at the cerebral level and scoring the lasting of action of the compound under test. The two test compounds were administered by intraarterial route at the dosage of 0.9 pM, in a volume of 0.2 ml for each animal. The results are reported in the following Table 1, which shows how PU 122 has a marked vasodilative activity at the cerebral level, substantially higher than that of Flunarizine.TABLE 1 Cerebral vasodilative activity in the rabbit of PU 122 and Flunarizine.
