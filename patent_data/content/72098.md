# Bleach composition.

## Abstract
A liquid bleach composition comprises a hydrogen perox ide precursor which includes as an enzyme an alcohol oxidase and as a substrate for the enzyme the corresponding alcohol, the enzyme and the substrate being incapable of substantial interaction in the composition. The composition contains less than 1 unit of catalase for every 2 units of the alcohol oxidase so that peroxide formation, when the composition is diluted with 100 times its volume of water to trigger the interaction of the enzyme and its substrate, is not substantially impaired. The diluted composition has a pH value of from 7.5 to 11. Prefer ably, the composition also comprises detergent active com pound.
