## Description
METHOD OF MANUFACTURING CYLINDRICAL COIL This invention relates to a method for manufacturing a cylindrical coil suitable for a position detecting apparatus which measures distance by utilizing magneto strictive vibration waves or for a coordinates input apparatus. Fig. 3 shows an example of a conventional position detecting device utilizing magneto strictive vibration waves. The reference numeral 1 represents magnetostriction transferring means of continuous length, 2 a first coil provided around the periphery of one end of the Eagnetostriction transferring means 1, 3 a protection cylinder for housing the magneto strictive transferring means 1, 4 a second coil provided around the protection cylinder 3, 5 a pulse current generator, 6 a processing device, 7 a positioning magnetism generator, and 8 a biasing magnetic substance. When pulse current is applied to the first coil 2 from the pulse current generator 5 in this structure, the magnetic field temporarily fluctuates on the first coil 2, whereby magneto strictive vibration waves are produced at the winding portion of the first coil 2 of the magnetostriction transferring means 1. These magneto strictive vibration waves are propagated at a propagation speed proper to the magnetostriction transferring means 1 in the longitudinal direction. During this propagation, the mechanical energy is converted into magnetic energy in correspondence with the electric mechanic coupling coefficient at a portion of the magnetostriction transferring means 1 where the magneto strictive vibration waves exist, whereby induced electromotive force is generated on the second coil 4. In this case, if a portion of the magnetostriction transferring means 1 is designated by the positioning magnetism generator 7, and magnetism sufficient to increase the electric mechanical coupling coefficient is applied to the position, a large induced electromotive force is generated on the second coil 4 when the magneto strictive vibration waves reach that portion. Therefore, the period between the time when the pulse current is applied to first coil 2 and the time when this large induced electromotive force is generated equals the time required for the magneto strictive vibration waves to reach the position designated by the positioning magnetism generator 7 from the position where the first coil 2 of the magnetostriction transferring means 1 is disposed.Accordingly, it is possible to detect the distance between the positioning magnetism generator 7 and the first coil 2 namely, the portion designated by the positioning magnetism generator 7, by detecting the above mentioned time by the processing device 6 and multiplying this time by the speed of the magneto strictive vibration waves. As described above, a coordinate input apparatus has already been put into practice which is composed of a combination in the directions X and Y of a plurality of paralleled positioning detecting elements consisting of the magnetostriction transferring means 1, the first coil 2 and the second coil 4. However, since the coil 4 is formed by mechanically or manually winding a fine conductor around the protection cylinder 3 formed of an insulating material and fixing the conductor with an adhesive or the like, this apparatus is defective in that the conductor is difficult to handle because it often comes off the periphery of the protection cylinder 3, which leads to poor working efficiency when winding the conductor around the periphery of the protection cylinder 3, and hence poor productivity. Accordingly it is an object of the invention to provide a method for manufacturing a cylindrical coil which is easy to handle and is efficient in productivity. This invention achieves this aim by having a spiral conductor layer formed on the outer peripheral surface of a cylindrical insulator, this being attained by forming a conductor layer on the outer periphery of the cylindrical insulator by deposition, plating or the like, and thereafter forming a spiral separated portion on the conductor layer by etching, machining or the like. According to this method, since the conductor on the insulator is formed bywdeposition, plat√≠ng or the like, the conductor never slips off the insulator, thereby making its handling easy.Furthermore, since the trouble of winding the conductor around the insulator and fixing it with an adhesive or the like is dispensed with, ssnd the simple process of forming the spiral separated portion on the conductor layer suffices, manufacture is facilitated and productivity is heightened. It is another object of the invention to provide a method for easily manufacturing a cylindrical coil having a plurality of spiral conductors insulated from each other on the outer peripheral surface of a cylindrical insulator.This invention achieves this end by having a spiral conductor layer formed on the outer peripheral surface of a cylindrical insulator which in this case consists of a conductor layer formed on the outer periphery of the cylindrical insulator by deposition, plating or the like, a plurality of spiral separated portions which are separated from each other thereafter being formed on the conductor layer by etching, machining or the like. This method enables a cylindrical coil having a plurality of spiral conductors insulated from each other on the outer peripheral surface of a cylindrical insulator to be easily manufactured.For these reasons also position detecting apparatus such as a coordinate input device incorporating such a coil can be more economically produced. In the accompanying drawings Fig. 1 is a perspective view of an example of manufactured according to the invention, the central portion being partially omitted Figs. 2 a to 2 d are perspective views of a cylindrical coil according to the invention, the central portion being partially omitted, which show the manufacturing steps of the cylindrical coil and Fig. 3 is a perspective view of a position detecting apparatus using a conventional coil. Fig. 1 shows a cylindrical coil manufactured according to an embodiment of the invention. The reference numeral 10 represents a cylindrical insulator, and 20 a spiral conductor formed on the outer peripheral surface of the insulator 10. The insulator 10 is formed of, for example, a ceramic fiber or a synthetic fiber, and this material may be any insulating material which is unspoiled by the atmosphere or the ambient temperature at the time of deposition and plating or by the solution or the like at the time of etching. The conductor 20 is composed of a metal which allows deposition, plating or the like such as aluminum, copper and nickel. Figs. 2 a to 2 d show the manufacturing steps of a cylindrical coil according to the invention. The insulator 10 as is shown in Fig. 2 a is first accommodated in a known form of deposition equipment or plating equipment, and an even conductor layer 21 is formed on the outer peripheral surface 11 thereof Fig. 2 b . Since the conductor layer 21 may be formed only on the outer peripheral surface 11, it is possible, if necessary, to cover both end surfaces 12, 13 and the inner surface 14. A spiral separated portion 22 is next formed on the conductor layer 21 extending over the entire length of the outer peripheral surface 11 of the insulator 10 by a known etching method or by machining with a lathe or the like, forming thereby a spiral conductor 20 Fig. 2 c . In this way, a cylindrical coil having a spiral conductor, namely, a coil on the outer peripheral surface of an insulator, is manufactured. The conductor 20 is connected with another circuit by soldering or the like. It is also possible to accommodate the magnetostriction transferring means 1 within the insulator 10, and to apply it to a position detecting apparatus or a coordinate input apparatus as described above. Incidentally, though only one conductor, namely one coil, is provided on the insulator in the embodiment, it is possible to easily manufacture a cylindrical coil having a plurality of spiral conductors which are insulated from each other on the outer peripheral surface of a cylindrical insulator by changing the pattern of the separated portion 22 and providing a plurality of separated portions 22 which are separated from each other on the same insulator 10 by the above described method. While there has been described what is at present considered to be a preferred embodiment of the invention, it will be understood that various modifications may be made therein, and it is intended that the appended claims cover all such modifications.
