# A method of producing bars composed of milk and simple and complex sugars, and bars obtained thereby.

## Abstract
The method consists of mixing intimately together, in the dry state, a set amount of powdered milk with a set amount of one or more carbohydrates selected from a group including glucose, fructose, maltose, sucrose, matoldex trines, and maltitol, and of compressing the mixture into a bar. Fluorine and optional flavoring matter, such as cocoa, coffee, strawberry flavor, mint flavor, are added to the mix ture prior to its compression. The resulting bars are in the form of square based parallelepipeds with rounded cor ners.
