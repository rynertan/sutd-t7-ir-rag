# HYDROGENATED POLYISOPRENE LUBRICATING COMPOSITION

## Abstract
A lubricating composition is provided containing a high viscosity synthetic hydrocarbon such as high viscosity, liquid hydrogenated polyisoprene olefin having a viscosity of greater than 3500 to 175,000 centistokes at 100 C a low viscosity synthetic hydrocarbon and or a low viscosity ester and optionally an additive package to impart desirable performance properties to the composition.
