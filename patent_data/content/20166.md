## Description
Improvements in Collapsible Binders and tbe like This invention relates to improvements in lightweight collapsible support structures and more particularly to those structures that include book covers or ring binders and the like as integral parts thereof for displaying the contents thereof or serving as an easel or other similar purpose, Lightweight collapsible structures useful for a variety of purposes have been disclosed in a number of United States patents and Canadian patents exemplified by the following U.S.P 433,635 issued August 1890 U.S P.844,066 issued February 1907 U.S.P.1,875,460 issued September 1932 U.S.P reissue patent 21,371 issued Bebruary 1940 U.S,p 2,587,316 issued February 1952 Can. Pat, 312,291 issued June 1931 Can, Pat. 315,615 issued September 29, 1931 Can.Pat. 641,733 issued May 1962, This invention relates to improvements in such collapsible structures but particularly of the nature disclosed in my United States patent No.3,990,669 which issued November 9, 1976 and the Canadian counterpart, Canadian patent No,1,010,008 issued May 10, 1977. The principal object of this invention is to provide an improved self sustaining lightweight collapsible support structure for a book cover or binder which is integrally associated therewith so that it is adapted, if desired, upon the book cover or binder being extended from a closed or folded position to a substantially fully extended open position to be supported upon in a suitable surface inclined erect stable configuration in order that its contents can be readily displayed or the cover used as an inclined working surface or easel, More particularly, it is an object of this invention to provide a collapsible support structure which will fold compactly with the book cover or binder either for carrying same or for storage and upon opening of the book cover or binder move automatically with the book cover or binder to assume an independently erect stable configuration when the cover or binder has reached the fully open position, Another important object is to provide a collapsible support structure of relative simplicity easily manipulated from its folded or compact state into the independently erect stable configuration, Still another object is to provide a collapsible support structure which in the fully extended position can be releasably locked in place to preserve its stability. Still another important object is to provide a cover or binder with support structure disposed therebelow thereby providing for ready viewing of the contents thereof or presenting a clear work surface and avoiding interference with enclosed pages or work sheets or the like when folded up. Still another very important object is to provide a support structure capable of being fabricated from low cost lightweight material using basic manufacturing steps and available apparatus requiring low labour content so as to ensure efficiency of production and reduce costs of manufacture. One feature of the invention resides in providing in combination with a cover, suitable as a book cover or as a binder or the like, which includes a stiff central panel portion or spine of generally uniform quadrilateral perimetral configuration arranged so as to present upper, lower and side edges and a pair of stiff side panel portions flanking the central panel portion and hingedly connected thereto along opposite side edges for swinging movement from a fully closed position to a fully open position with the panel portions in extended side by side coplanar relation and reversely, of a collapsible structure for supporting the fully opened cover from below and in inclined relation upon a suitable surface including a central strut located rearwardly and hingedly connected adjacent its upper edge to the central panel portion of the cover to swing from a position thereagainst to a substantially upright position therebelow, the central strut carrying shiftable side strut formations extending to and supporting each of the side panel portions of the cover formation and adapted to move with the central strut and central and side panel portions of the cover from the closed to the fully opened position and reversely with the shiftable side strut formations releasably anchor able against displacement with the cover formation in at least the fully opened position to stabilize the structure. It is to be understood that with such arrangement, the collapsible structure through manipulation closely embraces the cover when closed and automatically assumes an extended erect stable configuration locked against collapse when the cover is fully opened. Another feature resides in providing shiftable side struts that include reinforcing panel portions hingedly connected along fold axes lying substantially in the plane of the respective side panel portions of the cover so as to slidingly abut therebelow over the range of movement of the central strut and associated panel portions of the cover from the folded position to the substantially fully extended position and reversely.Thus it will be appreciated that not only may a book or binder include an integral collapsible supporting structure but one of substantial strength so as to better resist deformation or collapse in the fully erect disposition. More particularly, it is another feature of this invention that each flanking side panel of the cover formation include an elongated slot formation of selected configuration so as to present a channel formation with corresponding locking pockets at the remote ends thereof to guide follower members presented by respective shiftable side strut formations throughout the range of relative movement of the components with the locking pockets and cooperating follower members being adapted to secure the components against dislodgment not only in the fully extended position but in the fully folded position so as to ensure uniform displacement and avoid distortion in use. Still another feature resides in providing support structures which can be derived from substantially rigid sheetlike panels having a reproducible perimetral configuration so that they can be struck from flattened sheets of material in a conventional die cutting or stamping operation and in which fold axes can be simultaneously impressed or scored to define the several hinge connections. These and other objects and features are revealed in the following description which is to be read in conjunction with the sheets of drawings in which Figure 1 is a plan view of a preferred one piece layout or blank from which structures embodying the invention can be derived Figure 2 is a perspective view taken from the rear of a combined cover formation and collapsible support structure derived from the layout of Figure 1 Figure 3 is a perspective view of the structure of Figure 2 with the cover formation and collapsible support structure in the fully extended position Figure 4 is a perspective view of the embodiment of Figure 3 taken from the front and Figure 5 is a side elevational view of the embodiment of Figures 3 and 4 taken from the left inFigure 3 and from the right in Figure 4. The preferred embodiment of the invention as illustrated in Figures 2 to 5 inclusive of the drawings takes the form of a ring binder formation 12 provided with a collapsible support structure indicated generally at 14, the components of same preferably being integral and derived from a blank or layout 16 illustrated inFigure 1. The blank or layout 16 is struck from a suitable sheet of stiff plastic, for example, polyethelyne of a selected thickness so as to ensure stability of the structure. The layout 16 includes a first central panel portion 18 separated from flanking side panel portions 20, 22 by fold axes indicated by broken lines 24, 26 which are provided either by compressing the plastic sheet linearly during the die cutting operation or by inscribing the layout with suitable knife edges in another step. Elongated slots 28, 30 extend through side panel portions 20, 22 in a somewhat diagonal direction slots 28, 30 having in the preferred embodiment opposite symmetry and each terminating at their remote ends in anchoring pockets 28a, 28b and 30a, 30b respectively for a purpose to be explained. Hinged by an impressed or an inscribed fold axis 32 to the upper edge of central panel portion 18 is an elongated strut or panel portion 34 which is adapted to abut up against the rear surface of central panel portion 18 in the manner revealed by Figure 2. Two side strut formations 36, 38 flank central strut 34 and are separated therefrom by impressed or inscribed fold axes 40, 42 which are parallel and in the preferred embodiment illustrated in the drawings slightly more widely separated than parallel fold axes 24, 26 separating side panel portions 20, 22 from central panel portion 18. Strut formations 36, 38 include gusset panel portions 44, 46 respectively which prevent reinforcing panel portions 48, 50 being separated from gusset panel portions 44, 46 by impressed or inscribed fold axes 52, 54. It is to be appreciated that the fold axes 52, 54 extend diagonally from the intersection of respective fold axes 40, 42 and fold axis 32 whereby as best seen in Figure 3 reinforcing panel portions 48, 50 can abut the rear surfaces of side panel portions 20, 22 in the disposition illustrated. Reinforcing panel portions 48, 50 are each provided with openings therethrough as at 56, 58 respectively in which follower pins 60, 62 are adapted to be anchored, as illustrated in Figures 2 to 5 inclusive. Follower pins 60, 62 include head portions 60a, 62a respectively and suitably dimensioned shank portions 60b and 62b respectively which shank portions are adapted to be disposed within elongated slots 28, 30 for sliding movement therealong and secured against withdrawal therefrom by means of locking washers 64, 66 respectively fitted over and suitably secured to the ends of shank portions 60.b, 62b remote from the head portions 60a, 62a in a manner so as to closely draw washers 64, 66 against the forward surfaces of side panel portions 20, 22. It will be understood that follower pins 60, 62 register within anchoring pockets 28a, 30a respectively of slots 28, 30 when the supporting structure 14 is collapsed against the rear surfaces of central and flanking panel portions 18, 20, 22 of ring binder 12 as shown in Figure 2. Further, it will be understood that follower pins 60, 62 register within locking pockets 28b, 30b respectively of slots 2 8, 30 when the supporting structure 14 is in the fully erect extended position and depends rearwardly below the inclined central and flanking panel portions 18, 20, 22 of ring binder 12 as revealed particularly by Figure 3 and Figure 5 of the drawings. It will be observed in Figure 2 that the ring binder formation 12 is disposed so that the central and flanking side panel portions 18, 20, 22 are not fully extended. In such disposition the collapsible support structure 14 tends to lie next adjacent the rearward surfaces thereof suspended from fold axis 32 hinging elongated strut or panel portion 34 to the upper edge of central panel portion 18. Additionally, the flanking side panel portions 20, 22 and flanking side strut formations 36, 38 are held against separation by the follower pins 60, 62 registered within upper locating pockets 28a, 30a of elongated slots 28, 30. It will be understood that the fold axes 24, 26 of ring binder formation 12 and the fold axes 40, 42 of collapsible support structure 14 are substantially coterminous in the disposition shown in Figure 2 so that the composite article moves as a unit towards the fully closed or folded position. Thus, it is readily apparent that the composite folded article can be treated simply as a binder and handled in the usual manner. Supporting structure 14 illustrated in Figure 3 is shown fully extended having been displaced rearwardly by opening wide ring binder 12 to bring flanking side panel portions 20, 22 into side by side coplanar relation with central panel portion 18. Follower pins 60, 62 carried by the shiftable strut formations 36, 38 and registered in upper anchoring pockets 28a, 30a as shown in Figure 2 by slight shifting inwardly of respective panel portions 20, 22 are released therefrom and are guided by the narrow channels presented by elongated slots 28, 30 under disvltact MehtB dbwn ar d1y in a somewhat diagonal direction towards lowermost anchoring pockets 28b, 30b. Such movement swings central strut 34 rearwardly downwardly about fold axis 32 to present its lowermost edge 66 to a supporting surface 68 as revealed by Figure 5 and draws associated flanking side strut formations 36, 38 with it likewise presenting their lowermost edges 68, 70 respectively to surface 80. Follow pins 60, 62 at the lowermost extent of their travel within slots 28, 30 are presented to anchoring pockets 28b, 30b and by slightly shifting panel portions 20, 22 are urged into interlocking relation therewith so that central and side panel portions 18, 20, 22 respectively are held against dislodgment in substantially fully extended side by side coplanar relation. The extended configuration exhibited by the preferred embodiment of the composite article of Figures 3, 4 and 5 of the drawings likewise place the lowermost edges 70, 72, 74 of coplanar panel portions 18, 20, 22 in contact with surface 80 and with follower pins 60, 62 located within anchoring pockets 28b, 30b the entire structure is rigidified and assumes a substantial measure of stability. So extended, the composite article illustrated exposes the contents of the ring binder 12 for examinat ion or for viewing in the style of an easel or presents a work or display surface for any suitable purpose. The conventional three ring structure 76 of binder 12 in the several Figures 2 to 5 inclusive is optional but desirable where the structure is used as a notebook, since the pages when turned tend to lie flat against the inclined surfaces presented by the coplanar panel portions 18, 20, 22. Removal of the three ring structure 76 provides an extended flat surface for the mounting of drawings or for the displaying of products and the like. It will be observed that the outermost panel portions 48, 50 of collapsible support structure 14 are constrained by respective slots 29, 30 and follower pins 60, 62 and associated components in sliding abutment against the rearward surfaces of flanking side panel portions 20, 22 throughout the range of movement from the disposition or attitude of Figure 2 to that ofFigures 3 and 4. This arrangement dictates controlled movement of the components so that whether the support structure 14 is seized and moved either into the collapsed or extended position the associated binder formation 12 is correspondingly displaced. Likewise, if the binder formation 12 is displaced the support structure 14 is correspondingly altered. The positioning of slots 28, 30 is selected in the preferred embodiment so that they are as widely separated as possible which tends to afford maximum resistance of the erected article to deformation or collapse. Moreover, the strength of the composite article can be enhanced through the selection of more rigid or thicker sheet material for the integral panel portions. It is also to be understood that the several panel portions derived from an integral sheet as revealed by Figure 1 can be separate and appropriately hinged together in any suitable manner but that a onepiece blank or layout as revealed by Figure 1 is preferred in that it minimizes costs. The inclination of the binder panel portions 18, 20, 22 in the fully extended disposition of Figures 3, 4 and 5 can be altered by adjusting the relative dimensions of the respective front panel portions 18, 20, 22 of binder formation 12 and central strut 34 of the support structure 14 as by extending central strut 34 and associated flanking side strut formations 36, 38 for example, to achieve a more upright disposition and vice versa.
