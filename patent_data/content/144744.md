# Specific binding assay based on enzyme cascade amplification.

## Abstract
The present invention provides specific binding assay methods and reagent systems for the quantitative or qualita tive determination of an analyte in a liquid medium based on heterogeneous or homogeneous protocols. In particular, the invention relates to the use of specific binding assay techniques wherein the label is a participant in or a modulator of an enzymatic reaction whereby a first enzyme acts on a first substrate to produce a second enzyme. The second enzyme can be used to catalyze a detectable response or can act on a second substrate to produce a third enzyme. The label is chosen from the first substrate or a cofactor or modulator of the first enzyme. In one embodi ment, the first substrate is a zymogen which when acted upon by the first enzyme produces a second enzyme. When the final enzyme product is used to catalyze the production of a detectable response proportional of the concentration of the analyte, amplification results providing a very sensitive assay.

## Description
SPECIFIC BINDING ASSAY BASED ON ENZYME CASCADE AMPLIFICATION BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. FIELD OF TER I NVENTI ON The development of specific binding assay techniques has provided extremely useful analytical methods for determining various organic substances of diagnostic, medical, environmental and industrial importance which appear in liquid mediums at very low concentrations. Specific binding assays are based on the specific interaction between the substance under determination, herein referred to as the analyte , and a binding counterpart thereof. MMere one of the analyte and its binding counterpart is an antigen, the assay is known as an immunoassay. In conventional specific binding assay techniques, a sample of the liquid medium to be assayed is combined with a reagent system of various compositions.Such composition include a detectant reagent comprising a binding component incorporated with a label. The binding component of the detecting reagent interacts with other constituents of the reagent system and the analyte in the medium under assay to form a binding reaction system producing two species or forms of the detectant reagent, a bound species and an unbound species. In the bound species, the binding component, e.g., a hapten or antigen, in the detectant reagent is bound by a corresponding binding counterpart, e.g., an antibody, whereas in the unbound species, the binding component is not so bound. The relative amount or proportion of the detectant reagent that results in the bound species compared to the unbound species is a function of the presence or amount of the analyte in the test sample. Where the detectant reagent in the bound species is essentially indistinguishable in the presence of the detectant reagent in the unbound species by the system used to monitor the label, the bound species and the unbound species must be physically separated in order to complete the assay. This type of assay is referred to in the art as heterogeneous . Where the bound species and unbound species forms of the detectant reagent can be distinguished in the presence of each other, a homogeneous format can be followed and the separation step avoided. This invention relates to specific binding assay methods and reagent systems for the quantitative or qualitative determination of an analyte in a liquid medium based on heterogeneous or homogeneous protocols.In particular, the present invention relates to the use of specific binding assay techniques wherein the label is a participant in or a modulator of an enzymatic reaction. 2. DESCRIPSION OF HE PRIOR ART The first highly sensitive specific binding assay to be discovered was the radioimmunoassay which employs a radioactive isotope as the label. Such an assay necessarily must follow the heterogeneous format since the monitored response of the label is not significantly changed in the unbound and bound species.Because of the inconvenience and difficulty of handling radioactive materials and the necessity of a separation step, homogeneous assay systems have been devised using materials other than radioisotopes as the label component, including enzymes, bacteriophages, metals and organometallic complexes, enzyme substrates, coenzymes, enzyme inhibitors, cycling reactants, spin radicals, organic and inorganic catalysts, prosthetic groups, chemiluminescent reactants, and fluorescent molecules. British Patent No. 2,059,421A describes a method for determining a ligand or receptor which uses as the labeled component, a conjugate between i a ligand or a receptor and ii a primary enzyme that is itself capable of producing or removing a modulator for a secondary system or that is the first enzyme in an enzyme system that is capable of producing or removing a modulator for a secondary system. To complete the assay, the labeled component is determined by adding the primary enzyme and any other enzymes in the enzyme system, allowing the secondary system to function in the presence or absence as appropriate of the modulator, and determining a product of the secondary system. A suggestion is made to use the enzyme C3convertase as the label. C3 convertase acts on the complement factor C3 to produce C3b.C3b, in the presence of other components, will also convert C3 toC3b and is thus autoactivating. There are two disadvantages of this system that would prevent its use in a practical laboratory immunoassay first the label is an unstable enzyme and second no C3b substrates are available to provide a chromogenic detection system. Generally representative of homogeneous specific binding assays are those described in the following references U.S. Patent Nos. 4,134,792 4,226,978 4,230,797 4,238,195 4,238,565 4,208,479 4,233,401 4,265,834 3,817,837, 4,043,872 4,233,402 4,160,645 and 3,690,834. SUttLARY OF THE IN5tENTI ON In accordance with the present invention, a specific binding assay method and reagent system are provided wherein the label component employed in the detectant reagent is a participant in or a modulator of an enzyme cascade reaction wherein a first enzyme acts on a first substrate to produce a second enzyme.The production of the second enzyme can be followed or the second enzyme can act on a second substrate to produce a third enzyme. Whose production may be followed. The assay may be of the heterogeneous or homogeneous type, the latter being preferred. Following a homogeneous format, the progress of the assay is monitored by measuring the modulating effect of the specific binding of the detectant reagent with a binding counterpart thereof on the production of the second, third or subsequent enzyme. Such binding in the usual case causes an inhibition of enzyme production, however, enhancement of enzyme production is also contemplated. The method is applicable to the determination of a wide variety of analytes and to use in a wide variety of modes, from liquid test systems to solid state test devices, and from manual to automated systems. In the homogeneous format, the method for determining an analyte in a liquid medium preferably comprises forming a reaction mixture by combining the liquid medium with a reagent system which system includes a binding counterpart for the analyte and a detectant reagent. The detectant reagent comprises the analyte, or a binding analog of the analyte, incorporated with the label. The combination of the liquid medium with the reagent system results in the formation of a bound form of the detectant reagent, wherein the detectant reagent is bound to the binding counterpart, and an unbound form of the detectant reagent wherein the detectant reagent is not so bound the ability of the label to participate in or modulate the enzyme cascade reaction being measurably different when the detectant reagent is in the bound as compared to the unbound form. The activity of the second, third or subsequent enzyme formed in the enzyme cascade reaction in the reaction mixture is then measured as a function of the analyte in the liquid medium. All enzymes can bring about amplification, i.e., one enzyme molecule can catalyze formation of thousands of product molecules from a given substrate in a given period of time. However, true amplification, increased sensitivity of the assay system, results when the enzyme product of the enzyme reaction system is used in a second reaction to catalyze the formation of second product. At best, prior art methods for monitoring competitive protein binding assays are based on the use of enzymatic reactions which do not produce an enzyme product. Therefore true amplification, an increased sensitivity of the assay system to the concentration of the analyte of interest, is not possible. The advantage of the present invention is that since the reaction product is also an enzyme, it can, in turn, catalyze the formation of thousands of molecules of a second product.If this product is detectable, the concentration can be related to that of the analyte resulting in one step amplification.When this second product is a third enzyme which can catalyze the formation of a third product which can give a detectable response proportional to the concentration of the analyte, double amplification results. This double amplification cascade will allow an extremely sensitive assay. The enzyme cascade can be continued to allow further amplification if the third product is also an enzyme.

Binding counterpart of the analyte any sub stance, or class of substances, which has a specific binding affinity, normally re versible, for the analyte. Specific binding analog of the analyte any substance, or class of substances, which behave similarly to the analyte with respect to binding by a binding counterpart of the analyte. Reagent system a composition, test device, test kit, or other physical arrangement or combination of reagents for use in performing the present assay method. Label participant in or modulator of an enzymatic reaction wherein one enzyme acts on a first substrate to produce a second en zyme. The label is chosen from the first sub strate or a cofactor or modulator of the first enzyme. The label is a particularly novel aspect of the invention and is defined in more detail in the following description. Detectant reagent comprises a binding com ponent incorporated with the label. The general enzyme cascade reaction contemplated is one which follows the equation EMI9.1 tb SEP Enzyme SEP 1 tb Substrate SEP 1 SEP SEP Enzyme SEP 2 tb SEP Substrate SEP 2 SEP detectable tb SEP response tb The first enzyme Enzyme 1 may catalyze addition, cleavage or rearrangement of the substrate to produce the second enzyme. The enzyme formed Enzyme 2 can be used as a catalyst for a further reaction resulting in a detectable response with subsequent true amplification.

The enzyme formed Enzyme 3 can be used as a catalyst for a further reaction resulting in a detectable response. This double enzyme cascade system results in two steps or double amplification.Multi step amplification could be obtained if the third product is also an enzyme. There are a number of naturally occurring multiple cascade reactions which are useful in the present invention. Examples of such multiple cascade reactions are found in the blood coagulation cascade, the hemolymph coagulation system of the horseshoe crab, zymogens of digestive proteases and a phosphorylation cascade. The first enzyme first substrate pair must be chosen such that the enzyme product Enzyme 2 can catalyze the formation of a third enzyme by its action on a second substrate. Preferably reaction components are chosen so that there are specific substrates which are acted upon by Enzyme 3 to provide a detectable response. 1. Label Once a desirable first enzyme substrate pair is chosen, the present invention is based on the use of a label component in the detectant reagent selected from the first substrate, a required cofactor or any modulator of the first enzyme reaction. a. Substrate as the LabeZ The first substrate will usually be a proenzyme or a regulatory enzyme which may be activated or inactivated. Commonly, cleavage of addition of phosphate, an adenyl group, or a polypeptide will cause activation of a proenzyme or regulatory enzyme, or inactivation of a regulatory enzyme. When the cleavage of a polypeptide group from a proenzyme is catalyzed by a first enzyme to produce a second enzyme, the proenzyme substrate is called a zymogen. Zymogens are particularly preferred labels. Suitable zymogen first enzyme pairs include chymotrypsinogen trypsin, trypsinogen enteropeptidase, procarboxypeptidase A trypsin, procarboxypeptidaseB trypsin, proelastase trypsin, prothrombin Factor Xa, plasminogen urokinase, and Factor X Factor X activating enzyme from Russell s Viper Venom. Another group of suitable substrates is that of regulatory enzymes which may be activated or inactivated by the addition or cleavage of phosphate or adenyl groups See e.g., Table 1 . TABLE 1 ADDITION ACTION SUBSTRATE ENZYME 1 ENZYME 2 PO4 inactivates glycogen protein glycogen synthetase I kinase synthetase D PO4 inactivates phosphorylase phospho phosphorylase a protein b phosphatase PO4 activates phosphorylase phosphory phosphorylase b b lase b a kinase adenyl inactivates glutamine glutamine gluLamine synthetase synthetase synthetase adenylyl AMP transferaseCLEAVAGE PO activates glycogen phospho glycogen synthetase D protein synthetase 1 phosphatase When double amplification is desired, suitable zymogen first yen me pairs include 1 from the blood coagulation cascade Factor X Factor X activating enzyme from Russell s Viper Venom, Factor X FactorIXa, Factor IX Factor XIa, Factor XI Factor XII 2 from the horseshoe crab hemolymph system FactorB Factor X actlvat ing enzyme from Russell s ViperVenom 3 from the digestive zymogens trypsinogen enterokinase and 4 from the phosphorylation cascade phosphorylase kinase protein kinase. In each case, the first enzyme acts upon the first substrate to produce a second enzyme which second enzyme acts on a second substate to produce a third enzyme, resulting in a double enzyme cascade system.For example Factor X activating enzyme from Russell s Viper Venom theFactor X activating enzyme from Russell s Viper Venom is referred to herein as RVV acts on Factor X to produce Factor Xa, an enzyme which in turn can act on prothrombin to produce thrombin in a second enzyme, enterokinase acts upon trypsinogen to produce trypsin, an enzyme which in turn acts on proelastase to produce elastase. In each case, the third enzyme, thrombin or elastase, can catalyze the production of a third product which provides a detectable response which can be related to the concentration of the analyte of interest. In a preferred embodiment, RVV acts on Factor X to produce Factor Xa Factor Xa then acts on prothrombin to produce a third enzyme, thrombin. A suitable chromogenic substrate for thrombin is provided so that a detectable response is generated which can be related to the concentration of the analyte. For double amplification, another group of suitable substrates is that of regulatory enzymes which may be activated or inactivated by the addition or cleavage of a phosphate. One suitable first substrate first enzyme pair is phosphorylase b kinase protein kinase. Protein kinase catalyzes the addition of phosphate to phosphorylase b kinase to produce phosphorylase a kinase, the active form of the enzyme phosphorylase a kinase acts on a second substrate, phosphorylase b, to produce a third enzyme, phosphorylase a. A suitable substrate for phosphorylase a is provided, completing the double amplification cascade, so that a detectable response is generated which can be related to the concentration of the analyte. b. Co factor as the Label If the first substrate first enzyme pair chosen requires a cofactor to produce the second enzyme, that cofactor can be used as the label. Suitable cofactors are adenosine monophosphate AMP , adenosine triphos phate ATP , nicotine adenine dinucleotide NAD and other nucleotide coenzymes. For example ATP is required for the phosphorylation of glycogen synthetase I by protein kinase and of phosphorylase b by phosphorylase b kinase. 3 ,5 cyclic AMP modulates the phosphorylation of glycogen synthetase I to form glycogen synthetase D . In the double amplification casades, 3 ,5 cyclic AMP modulates the addition of a phosphate group phosphorylation to phosphorylase b kinase by protein kinase. In any of these reactions the cofactor can be used as a label.In the blood coagulation cascade, Factor VIIIa, Ca 2 and phospholipid are required as cofactors for the activation of Factor X by Factor IXa. c . Modulator of the First Enzyme as the Label Any substance which modulates the catalytic action of the first enzyme on the first substrate to produce a second enzyme may also be used as the label.Commonly, the modulat ion takes the form of inhibition, however, enhancement of the production of the second enzyme is also contemplatgd. These modulators include natural inhibitors, synthetic inhibitors, and antibodies or fragments thereof for the first enzyme. One natural inhibitor of a single amplification enzyme cascade is soybean trypsin inhibitor. Soybean trypsin inhibits the action of trypsin on chymotrypsinogen, thereby decreasing the production of chymotrypsin. One natural inhibitor of a double amplification enzyme cascade is a2 macroglobulin.a2 Macroglobulin inhibits the action of RVV on Factor X, thereby decreasing the production of Factor Xa. For examples, such compounds asEMI15.1 will inhibit the ability of trypsin to catalyze the conversion of chymotrypsinogen to chymotrypsin. Such compounds as diisopropylfluorophosphate, o phenanthreoline, ethylenediaminetetraacetate, and ethyleneglycol bis B aminoethylether N,N,N ,N tetraacetic acid will inhibit the ability of RT to catalyze the conversion of Factor X to Factor Xa. This first enzyme reaction can be used in a multienzyme cascade when a suitable second substrate for Factor Xa is provided. As a modulator label, one can also use an antibody raised to the first enzyme, or a fragment of such antibody. Techniques used to obtain the antibody are well known to those skilled in the art. In the reaction mixture, such an antibody label will bind the first enzyme, affecting the normal interaction of the first enzyme and first substrate, thereby decreasing or increasing the production of the second, third or subsequent enzyme. Natural binding proteins can be used in a similar manner. For example, avidin is a natural protein which binds biotin.2. Detectant Reagent The detectant reagent comprises two principal components which are coupled to one another either by direct chemical linkage, e.g., by covalent bonds or noncovalent binding, or by indirect attachment, e.g., through microcapsules or liposomes. One component is the binding component, whose function is well known in the art. The binding component and the analyte in the sample participate in the specific binding reaction system. Depending on the particular assay format followed, the binding component will usually be the analyte itself, a specific binding analog of the analyte, or a binding partner for the analyte. The choice of. a particular binding component in a given assay and methods for incorporating same into the detectant reagent are matters ofjordinaxy skill in the art. The other component of the detectant reagent is the novel label component of the present invention, a participant in or modulator of the first enzyme reaction in an enzyme cascade reaction. In choosing the sites of attachment on the binding component and the label of the present invention, the important considerations on a general level are 1 preservation of the ability of the linked binding component to participate effectively in the selected binding assay system, and 2 preservation of the ability of the linked label to participate in or modulate the first enzymatic reaction in both cases, to the extent that a useful assay will result for the particular analyte under assay and for the particular concentrations in which such is to be detected Commonly, the linking group will comprise a chemical bond, usually a single bond, or a chain containing between 1 to 20, more commonly 1 to 10 carbon atoms and 0 to 10, more commonly 1 to 5, heteroatoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. Further details regarding the selection of linking groups may be found in U.S.Patents Nos. 4,238,565 and 3,817,837. In the most usual case, the participant in or modulator of the first enzyme reaction in an enzyme cascade used as the label in the present invention and the binding component to be coupled therewith will have available amino and carboxyl functionalities for coupling by conventional peptide condensation reactions.Where the chosen label is a protein, e.g., when a substrate zymogen, or a modulator such as an antibody or other natural proteinaceous inhibitor or stimulator is used as the label, it will have numerous active amino and carboxyl groups to participate in peptide condensation. Oftentimes, the analyte will itself contain an amino or carboxyl group useful for coupling to the label by peptide condensation, such as where the analyte is a protein or polypeptide or is a hapten that is a primary amine or carboxylic acid. Where the analyte does not have an available functionality for coupling to the label, such can be readily introduced by forming an amino or carboxyl derivative of the analyte.Typical analyte derivatives of this type i.e., specific binding analogs of the analyte and further details concerning the formation of the detectant reagent by peptide condensation and equivalent techniques are provided in U.S. Patent No. 4,226,992, particularly in columns 3 10 thereof, which is incorporated herein by reference. Conventional peptide condensation reactions include the carbodiimide reaction Science it9 1344 1964 3, the mixed anhydride reaction Erlanger et al, Methods inImmunology and Immunochemistry,. ed. Williams and Chase,Academic Press New York 1967 p. 149 , and the acid azide and active ester reactions Kopple, Peptides and AminoAcids, W. A. Benjamin, Inc. New York 1966 . See also for a general review CZin. Chem. 22 726 1976 . In a preferred embodiment where Factor X is the label, the analyte is attached to this zymogen first substrate by covalent conjugation to the carbohydrate side chain attached to asparagine 36 of the bovine Factor X heavy chain, via periodate oxidation and subsequent reductive amination with an amino group on the analyte. When a cofactor or synthetic inhibitor is used 25 the label, the analyte or its binding analog can be linked through a free amino group to form the detectant reagent. It will be recognized that other well known methods are available for coupling the analyte and label to form the detectant reagent of the present invention.For example, bifunctional reagents can be used to couple amines to amines, e.g., bisisocyanates, bisimidoesters, and glutaraldehyde Immunochem. 6 53 1969 . Functional groups on the analyte, or binding analog thereof, and on the label other than amino and carboxyl,grpups can be used as the site of attachment depending on the synthetic approach selected. These synthetic routes are available to one of ordinary skill in the art from the literature. 3. Assay Techniques In broad principle, the present assay method may be performed according to any of the conventional homogeneous or heterogeneous formats. Homogeneous formats are generally preferred since they are particularly simple to perform. However, in those circumstances where the effect of the detectant reagent on the enzyme cascade reaction is essentially indistinguishable between the bound species and the unbound species, a heterogeneous format will be followed in order to perform an assay. a. Homogeneous Formats In the homogeneous assay technique, i.e., an assay technique which does not require a physical separation of the bound species and the unbound species, reaction between the binding component in the detectant reagent and a corresponding binding counterpart causes a measurable change, either in a positive or a negative sense, in the label s participation in or modulation of the first enzyme reaction in an enzyme cascade. The distribution of the detectant reagent between the boundspecies and the unbound species is usually differentiated by the inability or altered ability of the label to affect enzyme production when in the bound species.Several manipulative techniques are available for carrying out a homogeneous assay with a common technique being the competitive binding technique. In the competitive binding technique, the sample is combined with a binding counterpart of the analyte, a detectant reagent comprising the label coupled to the analyte or a specific binding analog thereof, and the other com ,ponents necessary to produce the second enzyme and thereafter measuring production of the second or third or subsequent enzyme in the reaction mixture. Alternatively, following a sequential test format, the sample and the analyte binding counterpart are first combined and thereafter the detectant reagent added. Homogeneous formats are applicable to the determination of any desirable analyte, including antigenic proteins and polypeptides and haptens. Antibodies may be determined as antigenic proteins by using either an anti antibody antibody as the binding counterpart, this antibody assay will only be class specific since it is unable to distinguish antibodies according to their antigen specificities , or an antigen or hapten as the binding counterpart. In the latter case, where antibodies, or other binding proteins, receptors, or binding materials in general, are determined according to their counterpart specificities, a direct technique can be used.The liquid medium is combined with a detectant reagent comprising the label coupled to a binding counterpart of the analyte, and the other components necessary to produce the second, third or subsequent enzyme, and thereafter final enzyme produced is again measured in the reaction mixture. In this case, the analyte may be antibodies having specificity for a particular antigen or hapten which serves, in its native form or a binding analog form, as the binding counterpart in the detectant reagent , or may be the binding capacity of the test saple to bind a particular substance due to the presence in the sample of a particular binding protein, receptor, carrier substance, or the like, e.g., triiodothyronine or thyroxine binding capacity T3 uptake or T4 uptake . In general, when following the homogeneous assay technique, the components of the assay reaction, i.e., the liquid medium suspected of containing the analyte, the detectant reagent, other components necessary to product second, third or subsequent enzyme, and, if necessary, a binding counterpart of the analyte, may be combined in any amount, manner, and sequence, provided that enzyme production is measurably altered when the liquid medium contains the analyte in an amount or concentration of significance to the purposes of the assay. Preferably, all of the components of the specific binding reaction are soluble in the liquid medium.Additionally, the reaction mixture will be formed to contain a conventional indicator composition which produces a detectable response, e.g., light absorption, color, fluorescence, chemiluminescence, and so forth, as a function of the production of the second enzyme. b. Heterogeneous Formats The present assay method can also be applied to the conventional heterogeneous type assay techniques wherein the bound and unbound species of the detectant reagent are separated and the label component in one or the other is determined. The reagent system for performing such a heterogeneous assay can take many different forms. In general, such a system comprises three basic constituents, which are 1 the analyte to be detected, 2 a binding counterpart of the analyte and 3 the detectant reagent, along with the other components necessary to produce the second, third or subsequent enzyme.The binding reaction constituents are combined simultaneously or in a series of additions and with an appropriate incubation period or periods, the detectant reagent becomes bound to its corresponding binding counterpart such that the extent of binding, i.e., the ratio of the amount of detectant reagent bound to a binding counterpart the bound species to that unbound is a function of the amount of analyte present. The bound and unbound species are physically separated and the amount of label present in one thereof is determined by measuring production of the second, third or subsequent enzyme therein and comparing such to a negative control or standard results, e.g., a standard curve. Various means of performing the separation step and of forming the binding reaction systems are available in the art. Separation can involve such conventional techniques as those involving what is commonly known as a solid phase antibody or antigen, a second antibody, or a solid phase second antibody, as well as the use of immune complex precipitation agents, absorbents, and so forth. Binding reaction systems that can be followed include the so called competitive binding technique, the sequential saturation technique, the sandwich technique, and so forth. Further details concerning the various known heterogeneous systems are readily available in the literature, e.g.,U.S. Patent No. 4,230,797. It is contemplated that manipulative schemes involving other orders of addition and other binding reaction formats can be devised for carrying out homogeneous and heterogeneous specific binding assays without departing frdm the inventive concept embodied herein.4. AnaZyte The present assay may be applied to the detection of any analyte for which there is a specific binding counterpart available. The analyte usually is a peptide, polypeptide, protein, carbohydrate, glycoprotein, steroid, or other organic molecule for which a specific binding counterpart exists in biological systems or can be synthesized. The analyte, in functional terms, is ususally selected from the group comprising antigens and antibodies thereto haptens and antibodies thereto hormones, vitamins, metabolites and pharmacological agents, and their binding counterparts, and hybridizable nucleic acids, e.g., DNA and RNA.Usually, the analyte is an immunologically active polypeptide or protein, usually having a molecular weight of between about 1,000 and about 10,000,000, such as an antibody or antigenic polypeptide or protein, or a hapten having a molecular weight of at least about 100, and usually less than about 1,500. However, the assay is particularly useful where the size of the analyte is 10,000 daltons or less, more preferably less than 5,000 and most preferably less than 1,500. Of course, the enzymatic reaction chosen must be such that it does not interact with the analyte itself.

None of the parameters therefore is of a critical nature to the present invention, rather they are all within the ordinary skill in the art. 6. Reagent System The reagent system of the present invention comprises all of the essential chemical elements required to conduct a desired assay method encompassed by the present invention. The reagent system is presented in a commercially packaged form, as a composition or admixture where the compatability of the reagents will allow, in a test device configuration, or as a test kit, i.e., a packaged combination of one or more containers holding the necessary reagents.Included in the reagent system are the reagents appropriate for the binding reaction system desired, always requiring a detectant reagent and the other components necessary to produce the second, third or subsequent enzyme as defined hereinbefore. Such binding reaction reagents can include, in addition to the detectant reagent, a binding counterpart to the analyte, the enzymatic indicator composition, and so forth. Of course, the reagent system can include other reagents as are known in the art and which may be desirable from a commercial and user standpoint, such as buffers, diluents, standards, and so forth. In particular, the present invention provides a test kit for determining an analyte in a liquid medium, comprising a a detectant reagent incorporating the label and the analyte or a binding analog thereof, b a binding counterpart, e.g., antibody of the analyte, c the other components of the enzymatic reaction necessary to produce the second, third or subsequent enzyme, and d optionally, an indicator composition which produces a detectable response as a function of the production of the final enzyme in the enzyme cascade. The present invention will now be illustrated, but is not intended to be limited, by the following examples. Example 1 A specific binding assay for the determination of theophylline as the analyte was devised usingFactor X Factor X activating enzyme from Russell sViper Venom as substrate first enzyme pair. Factor X is a zymogen which is cleaved by the activating enzyme present in Russell s Viper Venom herein the activating enzyme is referred to as RVV to form the enzyme, Factor Xa. Figure 1 is a flow chart showing the assay utilizing the enzymatic reaction. RWFactor XEMI27.1 Factor Xa The substrate, Factor X, was chosen as the label. The detectant reagent was formed by preparing a conjugate of theophylline and Factor X through the available lysine groups on the zymogen. In the presence of antibody to theophylline, the reactivity of Factor X in the detectant reagent was inhibited this inhibition could be reversed by the addition of free theophylline to the system. See Figure 3. The zymogen activation immunoassay system responded to changes in unbound analyte concentration to yield a dose response curve for theophylline. Activation was measured by addition of a chromogenic substrate,S 2222 a product of Kabi Vitrum AB and available in the U.S. from Helena Laboratories, Beaumont, TX , for the enzyme product, Factor Xa. The substrate undergoes a color change when acted upon by Factor Xa. Absorbance was measured on a spectrophotometer HewlettPackard Model 8450 and plotted versus time in minutes 2 to yield a linear plot. Details of experimental protocols and results follow.A. Preparation of Theophylline Factor X ConjugatesMaterials The label, Factor X, was incorporated with the analyte, theophylline, as follows To 1 milligram mg of bovine Factor X purchased from Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO containing 0.42 micromoles pmoles lysine in 1 milliliter ml of 0.2 Molar M sodium carbonate, pH 8.5, was added 0.21 mg 0.84 moles of a mixed anhydride of theophylline prepared as described by Cook, C.E.et aZ. Chem. PathoZ. PharmacoZ, 13 497 505 1976 in 0.4 ml p dioxane. The mixture was stirred for four hours at 5 degrees Centigrade OC and theFactor X theophylline conjugate was purified by dialysis against a solution containing 0.14 M sodium chloride and 0.05 M sodium citrate at pH 5.8 or by filtration through a Sephadex G 25 purchased fromPharmacia, Inc., Piscataway, NJ column, equilibrated in the same buffer. The activity of column fractions was assayed as described below. The degree of theophylline substitution was calculated from optical density data taken at 280 nanometers nm and theBradford protein assay Bradford, M., AnaZ. Biochem. 72, 248 1976 .B. Characterization of Theophylline Factor X Conjugates Two Factor X derivatives were prepared as described above. The first conjugate, purified by dialysis, contained 15.5 moles of theophylline per mole of Factor X, corresponding to derivatization of 67 of the total lysines the second conjugate, purified by gel chromatography, contained 9.5 moles of lysine per mole of protein 42 of lysines derivatized . Both conjugates showed a single precipitation line in radial immunodiffusion when tested against antitheophylline antibodies.C. Purification of Anti Theophylline Antibody An anti theophylline antibody was raised using standard polyclonal techniques and purified as follows Twenty five mL of antitheophylline antiserum Li,T. M. et aZ. CZin. Chem. 27, 22 26 1981 was brought to 50 saturation with ammonium sulfate, and the precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation.After suspension in 10 millimolar mM potassium phosphate at pH 7.0, the solution was again brought to 50 saturation with ammonium sulfate. The precipitate was collected and resuspended in 10 ml of 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer. After dialysis against 4 x 1 liters of 10 mbl potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, the dialysate was centrifuged to remove precipitated protein. Protein A agarose was prepared by swelling 1 gram of the dried gel purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. in 100 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0 and washing the swollen resin in 200 mL of the same buffer. The gel preparation was packed in a 1.2 x 3.5 centimeter cm column and equilibrated overnight with 100 mM monosodium phosphate NaHPO4 pH 7.0 One third 7 ml of the ammonium sulfate precipitated, dialyzed material was applied to the Protein A agarose column and the column was washed with 100 mM phosphate buffer, until the optical density of the eluate taken at 280 nm OD280 was at background levels. The immunoglobulin G fraction of the antitheophylline antisera was eluted with 1 M acetic acid.Those fractions which had a high optical density at 280 nm OD280 were pooled and dialyzed against a solution containing 0.14 M sodium chloride and Q.05 M citrate at pH 5.8. The concentration of the purified antibody was 5.62 mg of protein ml of solution.D. Purity and Activity of Anti Theophylline Antibody Addition of anti theophylline antiserum to the zymogen activation system led to positive interferences, due to the presence of activated blood coagulation factors in the serum sample. ProteinA purified anti theophylline antibodies contributed neither positive nor negative interferences to the system. The purified antibody retained its ability to interact with theophylline, and showed a single precipitin line on radial immunodiffusion when tested against Factor X theophylline conjugates. Method and ResultsA. Enzyme Assay All assays were performed in a total volume of 1 mL which contained 15 mM tris hydroxymethyl amino methane hydrochloride buffer at pH 8.2, 70 mbI sodium chloride and 7.5 mM calcium gluconate. TheFactor X activating enzyme from Russell s Viper Venom ROT, purchased from Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis,MO catalyzed conversion of Factor X to Factor Xa.This reaction was assayed in solutions which contained 0.6 mSI of a chromogen substrate S 2222 for Factor Xa,Factor Xa substrate, 0.2 NIH units of Factor X orFactor X analyte conjugate and 0.01 to 0.05 units ofRVV. All assays were run at 25 C and monitored continuously at 406 nm on an Hewlett Packard 8450 spectrophotometer. Absorbance was plotted versus time in minutes 2 to yield a linear plot. One NIH unit of a blood coagulation factor is the amount which is equivalent to the amount of 1 ml of normalDEF human plasma. One unit of RW is the amount of activating enzyme which will produce a clotting time of between 14 and 22 seconds in 9 one stage determination of Factor X, as described by Bachmann, F., et aZ., Thromb. et Diath. Baemorrh. 2, 24 1958 .B. Kinetics of Zyn,ogen Activation The immunoassay reaction scheme is shown inFigure 1. When the zymogen, Factor X, was incubated with the chromogenic substrate, S 2222, for FactorXa, very little color was formed. However, when R Tt was added to catalyze the conversion of Factor X toFactor Xa, color development was rapid and nonlinear with respect to time. A series of equations were derived which predicted that 1 color formation in the system should be linear with the square of time and 2 the slope of the line generated by a plot of absorbance versus time 2 should be a measure of the rate of the RW catalyzed reaction. The rate of this reaction is, in turn, dependent upon the concentration of Factor X and or RNN in the system.These predictions were verified experimentally using purified RVV and Factor X. When anti theophylline antibody was added to the zymogen system, activity measured as slope of 2 absorbance versus time decreased as antibody concentration increased, as shown in Figure 2. At high concentrations of antibody 200 400 pg mL , activity in the system was decreased to less than 10 percent of control values. An antibody concentration 121 vg mL was chosen which inhibited the system by approximately 75 percent and a dose response curve was generated by the addition of free theophylline to the system. As shown inFigure 3, when free theophylline at concentrations between 5 and 50 micromolar was included in the assay, inhibition by antibody was relieved, and the activity of the system measured as the slope of a plot of absorbance versus time 23 was restored. It was therefore possible to generate a dose response curve for the analyte, theophylline, using the zymogen activatoT system. Example 2 A specific binding assay for the determination of theophylline as the analyte A can be performed using chymotrypsinogen trypsin as the substrate first enzyme pair. The enzymatic reaction used is basicallyEMI32.1 tb SEP trypsin tb Chymotrypsinogen SEP SEP chymotrypsin tb SEP Th tb SEP substrate SEP detectable SEP response tb wherein the chymotrypsinogen is the first substrate, trypsin is the first enzyme and chymotrypsin is the second enzyme or enzyme product. Chymotrypsin hydrolyses the substrate, N benzylolyL tyrosine ethyl ester, to produce a detectable response a higher absorbance at 256 mn . The assay utilizes a modulator of the enzymatic reaction, soybean trypsin inhibitor, as the label which inhibits the production of chymotrypsin thereby decreasing the detectable response. Soybean trypsin inhibitor is used as the label to form the detectant reagent, A I. If no analyte is present, the antibody to the analyte,Ab, will bind the detectant reagent, A I herein referred to as the inhibitor , and decrease the inhibitory effect of soybean trypsin inhibitor, thereby increasing the detectable response of the system. If analyte is present, the antibody to the analyte Ab, will bind the analyte, leaving the detectant reagent,A I, to exert its full inhibitory effect on the enzymatic response of the system.MaterialsA. Preparation of a soybean trypsin inhibitor 8 3 carboxypropyl theophylline conjugate The detect ant reagent is prepared by linking soybean trypsin inhibitor to an analogue of theophylline, 8 3 carboxypropyl theophylline. The lactam of 8 3 carboxypropyl theophylline is prepared by the method of Cook et aZ., Res. Comm. Chem.PathoZ. PharmacoZ. 73, 497 1976 . Ten milligrams 0.45 micromole of soybean trypsin inhibitor available from Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis MO in 3 mL of 2.0 M sodium bicarbonate is combined with 10.7 mg 0.45 millimole of the lactam in 100 pL of dimethylformamide. This reaction mixture is allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 hour and then at 40C for 5 hours. After standing, the reaction mixture is chromatographed on a 2.5 x 28 cm column of Sephad G 25 medium Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Piscataway,N.J. and equilibrated with 80 mM tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane tris hydrochloride buffer, pH 7.8.The chromatogram is developed with this buffer and 1 mL fractions are collected. The fractions containing the first peak of protein, detected by absorbance at 280 nm, are pooled and stored at 40C. B. Preparation of antibody to theophylline Antibody to theophylline is prepared as described by Li et aZ., CZin. Chem. 27 1981 . The immunoglobulin G, IgG, fraction is isolated by affinity chromatography on Protein A Sepharose Pharmacia Fine Chemicals . A 1 mL sample of the antiserum is applied to the 1 x 6 cm column of the affinity resin and the column is washed with 50 mMN,N bis 2 hydroxyethyl glycine Bicine buffer, pH 8.3, containing 0.2 M NaCl until the absorbance of the effluent at 280 nm is less than 0.05. The boundIgG is then eluted with 0.1 M glycine buffer, pH 3.0, and 1 mL fractions are collected in tubes containing 0.1 mL of 1 M Bicine buffer, pH 8.3. Fractions with absorbances greater than 0.2 at 280 nm are pooled and dialyzed against 80 raM tris hydrochloride buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.1 M calcium chloride. C. Preparation of other reagents Chymotrypsinogen A from bovine pancreas, SigmaChemical Co. is dissolved at concentration from 2 to 50 vg ml in 80 mM tris hydrochloride buffer, pH 7.8, containing 0.1 calcium chloride and stored at 40C.Method and ResultsA. Assay for chymotrypsin activity Chymotrypsin hydrolyzes the ester groups of Nbenzolyl L tyrosine ethyl ester, the product having a higher absorbance at 256 nm than the ester. The ester is not hydrolyzed by trypsin, thus the rate of increase in absorbance at 256 nm is a specific measure of chymotrypsin activity. The assay is conducted at 250C in 80 mM tris hydrochloride buffer, pH 7.8, containing 0.1 M calcium chloride. B. Titration of trypsin Chymotrypsinogen A has no enzyme activity but trypsin hydrolyzes a peptide bond to form reactive n chymotrypsin as outlined below EMI35.1 tb SEP TI SEP chymotrypsin tb SEP trips SEP in tb Chymotrypsinogen SEP A tb SEP X SEP n SEP chymotrypsin tb SEP Y. SEP trypsin tb SEP neo chymotrypsinogen SEP SEP SEP a chymotrypsin tb SEP or tb SEP a chymotrypsin tb The new formed n chymotrypsin can act on chymotrypsinogen A to form neo chymotrypsinogen which is converted to the active a chymotrypsin by either trypsin or achymotrypsin. The immunoassay readout system is first optimized by combining various concentrations of the trypsin with a fixed amount of chymotrypsinogen A, and then measuring chymotrypsin activity. This optimization is conducted with molar ratios of chymotrypsinogen A to trypsin ranging from 50 to 50,000. The trypsin and chymotrypsinogen are combined and incubated at 250C for 5 minutes. The ester substrate is added and the reaction rate is recorded.The chymotrypsinogen A trypsin molar ratio which gives a substantial reaction rate, measurable over a 1 to 3 minute period, is used for further experimentation. C. Titration of soybean trypsin inhibitor theophylline conjugate A range of concentrations of soybean trypsin inhibitor theophylline conjugate are combined, in the 80 mM tris hydrochloride buffer, 0.1 M calcium chloride, at the optimal concentration oftrypsin determined as in part B above. The molar ratio of trypsin t6 inhibitor used is 0.2 to 5.0. Five minutes after combining the trypsin and inhibitor, chymotrypsinogen A is added. After 5 minutes further incubation, the substrate is aided and the reaction rate is recorded. A concentration of inhibitor theophylline conjugate which produces 808 inhibition of the activation of chymotrypsinogen A is used for further experiments.D. Titration of antibody to theophylline Various concentrations of antibody to theophylline are combined with the optimal level of inhibitortheophylline conjugate in 80 mM tris hydrochloride buffer, 0.1 M calcium chloride. Trypsin and chymotrypsinogen A are then added as outlined above partC . Chymotrypsin activity is measured. The activity increases as increasing levels of antibody inactivate larger portions of the inhibitor theophylllne conjugate.The antibody concentration which recovers 80 of the chymotrypsin activity, measured in the absence of inhibitor, is used for further measurements.E. Competitive binding assay for theophylline Various concentrations of theophylline are combined with the optimal level of antibody as determined in part D. These reactions are set up in the 80 mM tris hydrochloride buffer, 0.1 M calcium chloride.Inhibitor theophylline conjugate, trypsin and chymotrypsinogen A are then added as described in part A. Finally, substrate is added and the reaction rate is recorded. As the theophylline level is increased, the chymotrypsin activity will decrease. Example 3 A specific binding assay for the determination of biotin was devised using Factor X Factor X activating enzyme from Russell s Viper Venom as the first substrate enzyme pair and prothrobin as the second substrate. Factor X is a zymogen which is cleaved by a protease present in Russell s Viper Venom referred to herein as Factor X activating enzyme from Russell sViper Venom and abbreviated RW to form the enzyme,Factor XA. Factor Xa subsequently cleaves prothrombin, a second zymogen present in the reaction mixture to form the active enzyme, thrombin. The final enzyme product, thrombin, is used in a detection system where it acts on a chromogenic substrate to produce a detectable response.EMI37.1 tb SEP RW Ca tb Factor SEP X j SEP Factor SEP Xa tb SEP prothrombin SEP hrombin tb SEP tb SEP chromogenic SEP substrate SEP color tb The first substrate, Factor X, ws chosen as the label. The analyte, biotin, was conjugated with the carbohydrate side chain attached at the asparagine36 of the heavy chain of bovine Factor X, forming the detectant reagent. In the presence of avidin, a protein which binds biotin, the reactivity of FactorX in the detectant reagent was inhibited this inhibits tion could be competitively reversed by the addition of free biotin to the system see Figure 6 . The response of the double zymogen activation immunoassay system to changes in unbound biotin concentrations can be represented by the dose response curve for biotin.Activity of the system was measured by the addition of a chromogenic substrate for thrombin.The substrate, S 2238 a product of Kabi Vitrum, AB and purchased in the U.S. from Helena Laboratories,Inc., Beaumont, TX , undergoes a color change when acted upon by thrombin. Absorbance changes with time were measured on a Hewlett Packard Model 8450 spectrophotometer and absorbance was plotted against time in minutes to produce a linear plot. Details of experimental protocols and results follow.Preparation of a Factor X biotin ConjugateA. Selective oxidation of sialic acid residues of Factor X Two mg 6f bovine Factor X purchased from SigmaChemical Co., St. Louis, MO. were dialyzed overnight with a buffer containing 0.1 molar M sodium acetate, pH 5.6 and 0.15 M sodium chloride. The resulting dialyzed solution was adjusted to contain 5 millimolar mM sodium metaperiodate and allowed to react for 10 minutes at 4 degrees centigrade OC , 72 microliters uL of ethylene glycol were subsequently added. The reaction mixture was dialyzed overnight against 2 liters of 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 0.15 M sodium chloride before further reaction.B. Conjugation of oxidized Factor X to piperazine biotin To the dialyzed, oxidized material representing 0.254 micromoles moles oxidized sialic acid residues, was added 0.56 voles determined as amino groups , of piperazine biotin. preparation follows The reaction mixture was allowed to incubate at 250C for 2 hours to form a Schiff s base. Then 1 milligram mg sodium cyanoborohydride in 100 pE PBS a solution of 0.01 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 0.15 M sodium chloride was added, and the Schiff s base was allowed to reduce overnight at 4 C. C. Preparation of Biotin piperazine A solution containing 1.22 grams gm of biotin 5 millimoles , 863 mg of N hydroxysuccinimide 7.5 millimoles , and 15 ml of dimethylformamide DMF were evaporated at 300C, at a pressure of 0.1 millimeters mm of mercury. This process was repeated. The residue of the two evaporations was suspended in 10 milliliters mL of DMF, cooled to 0 C, and treated with a solution containing 1.135 gm of N,N dicyclohexylcarbodiimide 5.5 millimoles , in 7.5 mL ofDMF. The resulting suspension was then stirred for 0.5 hour at OOC, and allowed to warm to ambient temperature over 3 hours. The solution containing activated ester was filtered and added to a solution stirred at 0 C, containing 1.502 gm of 1 3 amino propyl 4 3 t butoxycarbonylaminopropyl piperazine and 700 p1 of triethylamine 511 mg or 5.05 millimoles in 5 ml of DMF. The resulting reaction mixture was allowed to warm to ambient temperature with stirring overnight. The reaction mixture was concentrated on a rotary evaporator at 300C, 0.1 mm of mercury, to give 5.1 gm of a reddish oil. The oil was dissolved in methanol, absorbed onto 5 gm of a silica gel, SiO2 60 EM Reagents, Darmstadt, Germany , and evaporated at 400C, 12 mm of mercury. The resulting powder was placed atop a chromatography column packed with 300 gm of SiO2 60 which had been packed and equilibrated with a solvent mixture containing 90 10 1 parts by volume v v v of chloroform CHCl3 , methanol and 28 ammonium hydroxide. The column was then eluted with 3 liters of the above solvent mixture, followed by elution with 2 liters of a solution containing 80 10 1 parts by volume v v v mixture of the same solvents. The column was eluted with a flow rate of 2 mL minute. Fractions of 12 mL were collected. Fractions, 330 440 contained the product, which were then pooled and concentrated to give 1.14 gm of a light yellow glass compound I .Compound I CMR 22.5MHz, D20 6 174.2 162.8, 155.7 ppm IR KCl 1695, 1640cm MS FAB,Xe M e 527 M 1, 42.4 A solution containing 881 mg of Compound I 1.67 millimoles , in 20 ml of trifluoroacetic acid was stirred for 90 minutes at OOC. The solvent was evaporated at OOC, 0.1 mm of mercury, to give 1.15 gm of an oily residue. This residue was dissolved in 10 mL of water and adjusted to pH 8 with 28 ammonium hydroxide. The sample was then chromatographed on a 3.7 x 37 cm column of Waters C18 reverse phrase resin 40 micron mesh, obtained from Waters Associates,Inc., Milford, MA eluted with water at a flow rate of 6 ml min. Fractions of 12 ml were taken.Fractions containing the product were combined with two pools on the basis of purity and concentrated to give 44 mg and 610 mg, respectively. The glassy solids were then purified by separate passes on a 2.5 x 60 cm column of Sephadex LH 20 obtained from Pharmacia FineChemicals, Uppsala, Sweden , eluted with water at a flow rate of 1 ml min. Fractions containing the pure product were pooled and concentrated to give a total of 154 mg of the final product as a glass. The product referred to herein as Biotin piperazine, was dissolved in H20 and was assayed for free amino groups by the method of Habeeb, A.F.S.A. knaZ. B ochem. 24, 28 1966 , and for biotin by the method of Green, M., Neth. Enzyme. 18A, 418 1970 .Biotin Piperazine CMR 22.5 MHz, D20 6 174.98, 160.08 ppm. MS FAB, Xe m e 427 M 1, 62 .D. Preparation of an avidin affinity column Sepharo CL 4B purchased from Pharmacia, Inc.Piscataway, NJ 10 g was activated by the method ofWilchek, T., and Miron, T. Biochem. Int. 629, 1982 activation time did not exceed 15 minutes. 30 mg avidin purchased from Sigma Chemical Co., St. LouisMO. in 15 mL of 0.2 molar sodium bicarbonate, pH 8.4 was added to the activated resin. The material was rotated 40 hours at 40C. The avidin Sepharose was filtered and washed sequentially with 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate, pH 8.4, and water. 10 mL of 1.0 molar ethanolamine, pH 9.0 was added to the washed resin. The resin was rotated end to end for one hour, washed sequentially with 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate and PBS, and packed into a 1.5 x 15 cm chromatography column. The binding affinity and capacity of this avidin Sepharose column was subsequently modified by treatment of the resin with guanidinium hydrochloride as follows two column volumes of 6 M guanidiniumhydrochloride were washed through the avidin column.The column was stoppered and allowed to incubate for approximately 18 hours at 25 C. The column was then washed with 6 M guanidinium hydrochloride until the optical density at 280 nanometers OD280 of the eluate was below 0.01 units . After guanidiniumhydrochloride treatment the column was washed sequentially with 2 column volumes of PBS 2.0 millimolar biotin purchased from Sigma Chemical Co., St.Louis MO in PBS, 0.1 molar glycine, pH 2.0, and PBS, then stored at 40C.E. Purification of Factor X biotin conjugate After reductive amination, the sample was placed on a 1.25 x 25 cm chromatography column packed withSephadex G 25 purchased from Pharmacia, Inc.,Piscataway, N.J. , equilibrated with Tris NaCl 15 mM tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane Tris HCl , pH 8.2, containing 70 mM sodium chloride and eluted with the same buffer at 40C to remove the excess biotinpiperazine. Fractions were assayed for protein content by determining the OD280. Protein containing fractions were assayed for Factor X activity as described below. The active fractions were pooled for subsequent application to the avidin column. Fractions containing Factor X activity were then applied to a 1 x 7 cm column of immobilized avidin.The column was eluted at 250C with Tris NaCl until no more protein, as determined by optical density measurements taken at 280 nm, was washed from the column. Factor X biotin conjugate was specifically eluted from the affinity resin with 2 mM biotin inTris NaCl. Fractions were assayed for Factor X activity and those fractions of high and intermediate activity were pooled separately. Total yield ofFactor X activity was 47.7 . The pooled material was made 1 mg mL with bovine serum albumin obtained fromMiles Scientific, Naperville, IL and dialyzed bvernight against Tris NaCl to remove free biotin.F. Stability of Factor X Biotin Conjugate The Factor X biotin conjugate, prepared as described above, was tested over 5 days for its ability to retain Factor X activity. The pooled fractions with intermediate Factor X activity lost approximately 30 of their activity after the first day of storage, and subsequently stabilized. The pooled fractions with high Factor X activity lost less than 208 of their activity during the course of the stability studies and exhibited stability equivalent to that of untreated Factor X. G. Determination of Equivalent Activity in Factor X Biotin and Untreated Factor X The specific activity of the Factor X biotin conjugate was calculated based on its ability to be activated by RVV. Factor X biotin conjugate with an activity equivalent to that of 0.25 NIH units per milliliter of untreated Factor X was used for subsequent experiments. One NIH unit of a blood coagulation factor is defined as amount of blood coagulation factor equivalent to that found in one milliliter of normal human plasma . One unit ofRW is the amount of enzyme which will produce a clotting time of between 14 and 22 seconds in a one stage determination of Factor X, as described byBachmann, F., et aZ., Thromb. et Diath. Haemorrh., 2, 24 1958 .H. Activity of the Factor X biotin Conjugate in the Multiple Zymogen Activation System Bpth pooled fractions were tested for their ability to react in the complete cascade. A replot of absorbance versus the cube of time in minutes was linear, indicating that the Factor X conjugated derivative had retained its ability to react properly with thrombin. The slope of this linear plot is used as a measure of the Factor X activity in the cascade system Blake, D.A., Blake, R.C., II, and SmithP.J. Fed. Proc. 42, 1863 1983 . Addition of the biotin binding protein, avidin, to the system resulted in a decrease of color formation, with a retentiOn of proper kinetic response.Titration of the Factor X biotin cascade with avidin is shown in Figure 5. Inhibition of the system was linear when 2 to 10 micrograms milliliter ug mL of avidin were added at very high concentrations of avidin 200 500 vg mL inhibition reached a maximum of approximately 85. An avidin concentration 8 vg mL was chosen which produced approximately 50 inhibition of cascade activity, and free biotin was added in an attempt to assess the sensitivity of the system to analyte concentration, as shown in Figure 6. These results indicate that a linear dose response curve with the addition of 20 to 100 nanomolar biotin. I. Enzyme Assays RW and prothrombin were purchased from SigmaChemical Co., St. Louis, MO. All assays were performed in 1 mL total volume which contained 15 mMTris H 1, pH 8.2, 70 mM sodium chloride and 10 mM calcium chloride. RAW catalyzed conversion ofFactor X to Factor Xa and was assayed in solutions which also contained 0.6 mM S 2222 Factor Xa substrate, a product of Kabi Vitrum, AB and purchased from Helena Laboratories, Beaumont, TX , 0.05 to 0.10 units of RW and varying concentrations of Factor X or Factor X analyte conjugate.Multiple zymogen activation was assayed in solutions which contained buffer salts as described above, 20 vg mL phospholipid, 0.075 raM S 228 a thrombin substrate , 0.2 NIH units of prothrombin, 0.05 units of RVV and Factor Xanalyte conjugate with activity equivalent to that of 0.25 NIH units of untreated Factor X. Analyte binding protein was allowed to incubate 5 minutes at 25 C with Factor X analyte with and without free analyte before initiation of the reaction. Phospholipid solutions were made fresh weekly by sonication of a 2 mg mL solution of L alpha phosphotidylcholine purchased from Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO. in Branson sonicator 50 milliamperes, 2 x 2 minute bursts . All assays were run at 25 C and monitored continuously at 406 nm on Hewlett Packard 8450 spectrophotometer. Depending upon the reaction monitored, absorbance was plotted vs. time in minutes for the activation of Factor X, or in time in minutes 3 multiple for the zymogen activation, to yield linear plots. Obviously, many other modifications and variations of the invention as hereinbefore set forth may be made without departing from the spirit and scope thereof.
