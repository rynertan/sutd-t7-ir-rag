# A DEVICE FOR TREATING WASTE WATER BY GRAVITATIONAL SEGREGATION

## Abstract
A device for treating waste water, wherein by gravitational segregation the waste water is separated from the water insoluble substances contained therein, such as oil, comprises a stream trajectory, which accomodates a feeding chamber communicating with lower ends of separation channels. Therein the substance guide means extend transversely of the stream trajectory below the channels. Since the overall flow space of the plate separator is passed in one and the same upward direction and because it is ensured that the flow rate in alle separation channels is substantially the same, a satisfactory gravitational segratation is obtained owing to the comparatively low, uniform flow rate in alle separation channels.
