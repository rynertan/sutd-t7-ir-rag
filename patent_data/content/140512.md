# Method for making molten metal sampler.

## Abstract
A non splash molten metal sampler has a refractory fiber body which defines a cylindrical mold cavity with sand resin plugs providing end walls for the cavity. The plugs can be formed in place. The fiber body is easily machined to provide a side entry port and grooves for pin sample tubes and thermocouple wires.
