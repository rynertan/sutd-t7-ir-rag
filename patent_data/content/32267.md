# Concentrated textile treatment compositions and method for preparing them.

## Abstract
Concentrated fabric softening static control composi tions, for use in the rinse cycle of the laundering operation, are disclosed. These compositions include a water insoluble cationic softener, a long chain hydrocarbon, such as paraffin, and specific mono long chain amine or amine derived com pounds. The use of these amine compounds provides com positions, exhibiting excellent softening and static control performance, which are stable during long periods of stor age and which are easily processed due to their viscosity characteristics. A method for preparing these compositions is also disclosed.
