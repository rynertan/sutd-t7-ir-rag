# Electric cable glands and terminations.

## Abstract
In a gland for a steel tape armoured cable, the tape grip comprises two annular components 6, 4 arranged to be urged axially towards one another when the gland is tightened. The first annular component 6 comprises an inner sleeve 7, which underlies the end of the tape 2 on the cable, an outer sleeve 8 surrounding and spaced from the inner sleeve and a body 9 connecting them together at one end. The second annular component 4 is radially contractible, e.g. is slotted and is dimensioned to be a force fit within the free end of the outer sleeve. The inner surface of the outer sleeve and or the outer surface of the second annular component are tapered so that when the first and second annular components are urged together the second annular component will be contracted to grip the tape or tapes between itself and the inner sleeve and will become wedged inside the outer sleeve.

## Description
ELECTRIC CABLE GLANDS AND TERMINATIONS, This invention relates to glands for terminating electric cables having armouring made of metal usually steel tapes, and to the terminations made with them. The object of the invention is to provide a grip for the end of the metal tape or tapes that is effective, with few parts, is range taking and in which the cut edges of the tape are protected. In the gland in accordance with the invention, the tape grip comprises two annular components arranged to be urged axially towards one another when the gland is tightened, namely i a fitst annular component comprising an inner sleeve, which underlies the end of the tape on the cable in the finished termination, an outer sleeve surrounding and spaced from the inner.sleeve and a body connecting the inner and outer sleeves together at one end and ii second annular component which is radially contractible and is dimensioned to be a force fit within the free end of the outer sleeve the inner surface of the outer sleeve and or the outer surface of the second annular component being tapered so that when the first and second annular components are urged together the second annular component will be contracted to grip the tape or tapes between itself and the inner sleeve and will become wedged inside the outer sleeve. Preferably the first annular member is made in one piece from any suitable metal or strong rigid plastics material when of metal it may be machined or , if the volume justifies it, extruded. The second annular member is preferably made contractible by a single slot exit dint its full length but other means could be used e.g. a number of slots all, or all but one, of which stop short of one end or of the inside surface of the member . Preferably the taper is on this umber and preferably it comprlses,twb parts, the first part relatively steep e.g. 40 500 semiangle so that only a small axial movement is needed to bring the tapes into contact with the inner sleeve and the second part much shallower e.g. 5 100 semiangle to ensure that the parts wedge firmly together so that they will remain firmly locked on the end of the cable if the gland is subsequently released. In the accompanying drawings, Figure 1 is a cross section of a grip with the remainder of a termination in accordance with the invention shown in broken lines Figures 2 and 3 are perspective sketches of the first and second annular components respectively, and figure 4 is an enlarged section through the second annular component. In making the termination shown, the cable end 1 is cut back to expose a length of the armour tape 2 which is simply trimmed to length at 3. After sliding a second annular component 4 together, in most cases, with other conventional gland members 5 over the exposed tape, the first annular component 6 is positioned as shown with its inner sleeve 7 underneath the tape, its outer sleeve 8 surrounding and spaced from it, and the end body 9 joining them abutting, or nearly abutting, the cut end 3 of the tape. In this way the end 3 is thereafter protected from contact with personnel or parts of the cable that might be cut by its possibly sharp edges. The second annular component 4 is now brought into position and forced into the outer sleeve of the first, as by screwing together the conventional gland members 5 and 10. The dimensions of the second annular member are such t at the free end of the outer sleeve on t first annular member first engages the steeply tapering face 11, whereby the sleeve rapidly contracts by closing of the slot 12 figure 3 to squeeze the tape 2 onto the surface of the inner sleeve 7, whereupon the end of the sleeve passes on to the less steeply inclined face 13 which generates effective gripping and locking forces.
