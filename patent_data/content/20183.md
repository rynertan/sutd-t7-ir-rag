# Poly ion complex, process for its preparation and shaped articles prepared therefrom.

## Abstract
A poly ion complex, which can be readily processed into shaped articles such as films and fibres, is prepared by reacting a carboxymethyl chitin, N acylchitosan or derivative of chitin or N acylchitosan, or a salt thereof, with a polyelectrolyte in an aqueous solution. Preferably the degree of carboxymethylation is from 0.3 to 1 per pyranose unit. In addition to carboxymethylchitin and carboxymethyl N acylchitosan, their respective deacetylated and de N acylated derivatives can be employed. The polyelectrolyte can be a water soluble chitosan or chitosan derivative, a water soluble sulfated chitin or chitosan, dextran sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, heparin or an anionic or cationic water soluble polymer.
