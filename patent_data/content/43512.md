# Thermoplastic resin compositions.

## Abstract
Thermoplastic resin compositions which comprise 20 70 parts by weight of a polyvinyl chloride resin and 80 30 parts by weight of a mixed composition of the follow ing copolymers A and B in the following ratio A 90 50 by weight of a copolymer which com prises 65 90 parts by weight of α methylstyrene with 35 10 parts by weight of acrylonitrile and 0 5 parts by weight of at least one copolymerizable vinyl monomer and contains 30 parts by weight or more of a component having an α methylstyrene content of 82 by weight or higher and B 10 50 by weight of a graft copolymer obtained by reacting 35 80 by weight of a conjugated diene rubber and 65 20 by weight of a monomer comprising an aro matic monovinyl compound, an unsaturated nitrile com pound or an alkyl methacrylate. These compositions have greatly improved heat resis tance, especially resistance to heat distortion, and impact resistance over those of polyvinyl chloride resins.
