# Low noise signal generator.

## Abstract
A signal generator for high level low noise signals is dis closed. The preferred embodiment of the invention utilizes the output signal of a low noise crystal oscillator as a fundamental reference signal. The fundamental reference signal is multi plied to generate a series of coherent reference signals. Addi tionally, one of the coherent reference signals is coupled as an input signal to a divide circuit to generate at the output of the divide circuit a plurality of coherent low frequency reference signals. The coherent reference signals and the low frequency coherent reference signals are utilized by a synthesizer to gen erate a plurality of coherent signals having a frequency deter mined by the synthesizer. The output signal of the synthesizer is combined with one or more of the reference signals to gener ate the microwave output signal which is stepped from a mini mum value in equal increments.
