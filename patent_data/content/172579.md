# Modified siliceous supports.

## Abstract
A modified silica material which comprises silica cova lently bonded to a synthetic polymer, the synthetic polymer being made from a a polymerizable compound capable of being covalently coupled directly to said silica, and b one or more polymerizable compounds containing i an ionizable chemical group, ii a chemical group capable of transforma tion to an ionizable chemical group, iii a chemical group capable of causing the covalent coupling of the compound b to an affinity ligand or a biologically active molecule or IV a hydrophobic compound.
