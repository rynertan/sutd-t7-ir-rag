# ELECTRO HYDRAULIC STEERING GEAR FOR WATERCRAFT

## Abstract
This invention relates to a steering gear for any water craft, particularly of small and medium tonnage, comprising a rudder hydraulic actuating unit which can be fed, alternate ly, by either a manual hydraulic pressure generator, consti tuted by a pump that can be operated manually through the steering wheel, and by a powered hydraulic pressure generator, constituted by a motor driven pump that can be actuated through an electronic remote control transmitter, or telemotor transmitter. According to the invention, this steering gear is characterized in that the steering wheel for the manual pressure generator operates, besides the pump of the manual pressure generator, also the remote control transmitter of the powered hydraulic pressure generator.
