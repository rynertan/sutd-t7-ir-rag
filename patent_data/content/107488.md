# SILVER HALIDE EMULSIONS

## Abstract
Silver halide emulsions can be provided with a remarkable degree of stabilization against variations in the bromide ion content of processing solutions by the use in combination of a silver chlorobromide or silver chlorobromoiodide as silver hal ide, b a hydroxytetrazaindene compound, and c a nitrogen containing heterocyclic compound having at least one mer capto group, the grains of said silver halide having such a size distribution that the variation coefficient is not more than 0.15.
