# Dynamic type memory device.

## Abstract
A dynamic type memory device includes a plurality of one transistor one capacitor type memory cells MC 11 to MC MN which are arranged in a matrix, first bit lines BL1 1 to BL1 M connected to the memory cells MC 11 to MC MN , second bit lines BL0 1 to BL0 M , and first capacitors C₁ re spectively connected to the second bit lines BL0 1 to BL0 M and having a capacitance equal to 1 2 of that of the memory cell capacitor CS . This memory device further has second capa citors C₂ respectively connected to the second bit lines BL0 1 to BL0 M and having a capacitance equal to 1 2 of that of the memory cell capacitor CS , first switching transistors Q₆ connected respectively between a power source terminal VC and the first capacitors C₁ , and second switching tran sistors Q₇ connected respectively between a ground termi nal VS and the second capacitors C₂ .
