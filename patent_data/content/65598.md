# Improvements in telecommunication receivers.

## Abstract
A DTMF telecommunication receiver in which an addi tional DTMF receiver circuit is provided tuned to a particular pair of tones. Detection of the particular tones opens a switch in the audio output line and eliminates crosstalk in the hybrid circuit making detection of further DTMF tones less likely to error.
