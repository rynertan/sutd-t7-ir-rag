# Method of making tool inserts, wire drawing die blank and drill bit comprising such inserts.

## Abstract
A method of making inserts 12 suitable for tool or drill bits which includes the step of fragmenting, e. g. by means of a laser beam, an abrasive compact 10 in a plurality of discrete, non segmental fragments 12 . The inserts 12 may have a variety of shapes, some of which are new, such as conical, truncated conical or truncated pyrimidal. The inserts 12 are particularly useful for wire drawing die blanks and core or oil well drill bits.
