## Description
This invention relates to the cosmetics of hair and, more particularly, to hair treatment compositions which can impart so called steadiness and firmness to the hair and exhibit excellent touch when they are applied to the hair. The hair is one of the most important parts of human body, on which a diversity of beauty treatments are applied. Among the beauty treatments, permanent wave treatment is well known and is most effective in setting the hair properly. However, this treatment has the drawback that since oxidation and reduction reactions are utilized to set the hair, the hair is considerably damaged during the treatment. In recent years, there is a demand of the development of hair treatments which can effectively set the hair without resorting to any permanent wave art. Various methods have been proposed including, for example, a method of reinforcing the hair using combinations of collagen hydrolysates, quarternary ammonium salts, cationic polymers and or harmless divalent metals Japanese Laid open Application No. 55 54551 and US A 3 958 581 , a method in which water soluble salts of chitosan are used as fill forming resin to improve the retentivity and stability of dressed hair Japanese Laid Open Application No. 52 156938 , and a method wherein anionic polymers and cationic surface active agents and silicone derivatives are used in combination to impart high set retentivity and curl durability to hair Japanese Laid open Application No. 55 108811 . However, although all of these methods are effective in imparting steadiness and firmness to the hair at the time of setting the hair, they have the disadvantage that the hair treated becomes stiff, considerably spoiling the inherent touch of the hair. Further, there has been proposed a method using oils which are one starting material of cosmetics but such a method is not widely applied because of the stickiness of oil. It is an object of the invention to provide hair treatment compositions which can impart smoothness and softness to the hair and exhibit excellent touch on application without showing undesirable stickiness. It is another object of the invention to provide hair treatment compositions which exhibit good affinity for hair as will not be experienced in prior art counterparts. The above objects can be achieved, according to the invention, by hair treatment compositions which comprise the following three ingredients A , B and C The derivatives of keratin of ingredient A used in the present invention can be prepared by oxidizing keratin materials and optionally converting them into base salts, by reducing keratin materials, chemically modifying the mercapto groups of the reduction product, and optionally converting the modified product into base salts, and by hydrolyzing keratin materials. The starting keratin materials are, for example, animal hair, human hair, feathers, nails, horns, hooves and scales, among which wool, human hair and feathers are most preferable. These keratin materials can be subjected to the oxidation or reduction reaction directly but may be cut or reduced into pieces or subjected to pretreatments such as washing and defatting, if necessary. The derivatives of keratin material can be prepared by any of the following methods. The oxidation of keratin material is effected by any of methods known per se N. H. Leon Textile Progress. Vol. 7, page 1 1975 . Oxidizing agents are preferably organic or inorganic agents which are of the type that act electrophilically on the disulfide bonds S S bonds in the keratin structure. Examples of the oxidizing agents include organic peracids, inorganic peroxo acids or their salts, permanganic acid or its salts, chromic acid or related compounds, halogens, peroxides and oxyacids or their salts, among which organic peracids such as peracetic acid, performic acid and perbenzoic acid are most preferred. The oxidation reaction is carried out in a liquid medium using oxidizing agents in excess with respect to the disulfide bonds in keratin material, ordinarily in amounts over two equivalents or more, preferably 4 to 10 equivalents, of the sulfide bonds. The reaction may be conducted under acidic or alkaline conditions and is preferably carried out under acidic and particularly weakly acidic conditions. The conditions such as reaction temperature and pressure depend on the types of the oxidizing agent and keratin material used and are not critical. In general, room temperature is sufficient but, if necessary, heat may be applied. The pressure is a normal pressure but the reaction may be effected under reduced pressure or pressure. By this oxidation, the disulfide bonds of keratin material are converted into sulfo groups SO₃H . Reducing agents employed for reducing keratin materials are preferably organic or inorganic reducing agents of the type which are capable of cleaving the disulfide bond in the keratin structure into a mercapto group SH and act nucleophilically on the disulfide bond. Examples of the reducing agent include organic reducing agents such as 2 mercaptoethanol, thioglycollic acid, benzyl mercaptan, 1,4 dithiothreitol and tributylphosphine, and inorganic reducing agents such as sodium hydrogen sulfite, sulfides such as sodium hydrogen sulfide, metallic hydrides such as lithium aluminium hydride. The amount of the reducing agent is usually in the range of 2 to 10 equivalents of the disulfide bonds in keratin material. The reaction system has generally a pH range of 2 to 12, preferably 6 to 11. Outside the range, the undesirable hydrolysis takes place at the same time. The room temperature is sufficient but heat may be applied to shorten the reaction time. The reaction time is ordinarily in the range of 2 to 3 hours or more. Since it is necessary that the mercapto groups produced by the reaction do not undergo substantial oxidation, the reduction operation should preferably be carried out in an atmosphere of inert gas to give good results. The mercapto groups of the product obtained by the reduction of keratin material is then chemically modified to yield a derivative thereof. The derivatives of the mercapto groups are The chemical modification of mercapto group is feasible by any techniques known per se and can be effected according to procedures known, for example, from N.H. Leon Textile Progress, Vol. 7 1975 , Yuuki loo Kagobutsu Organic Sulfur Compounds written by Shigeru Daikyo and published by Kagaku Dojin 1968 , and Kobunshi Jikken Koza written by Masami Oku, Vol. 12, Kyoritsu Shuppan 1957 . Typical methods are described in the following. in which at least one of R₁, R₂, R₃ and R₄ represents a group having a carboxyl group or sulfo group therein and the others independently represent an alkyl group of hydrogen atom, and K has the same meaning as defined above . Compounds reacting by this method include, for example, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, crotonic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, vinyl carboxymethyl sulfone, vinylsulfonic acid para styrenesulfonic acid and 2 acrylamido 2 methylpropansulfonic acid. in which K has the same meaning as defined hereinabove . Mentioned as acid are, for example, inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid phosphoric acid, nitric acid and hydrobromic acid, and organic acids such as acetic acid, formic acid and oxalic acid. These acids are generally employed at a concentration of 3 to 85 and it is desirable that the hydrolysis reaction is at a pH below 4. The reaction temperature is preferably in the range of 40 to 100 C though it may be raised up to 160 C under pressure. The reaction time is conveniently in the range of 2 to 24 hours. The reaction product may be used directly after neutralization with bases such as sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate and ammonia. Alternatively, it may be used after subsequent purification such as by gel filtration and ion exchange resin. The products obtained by the hydrolysis with acid involves no changes other than hydrolysis at the polypeptide chains of keratin, so that better results are obtained than those of products obtained by hydrolysis with bases. As bases, there are used inorganic bases such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, barium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, lithium carbonate, sodium silicate and borax. These bases are conveniently used at a concentration of 1 to 20 . Larger amounts than as required are unfavorable because the resulting hydrolysate solution becomes brown or black in color. The reaction is preferably carried out at a temperature of room temperature to 100 C for a time of 30 minutes to 24 hours. Care should be taken not to use higher temperatures and longer reaction time than necessary. As the hydrolysis reaction with bases proceeds, the hydrolysate of keratin dissolves with the attendant advantage that the extent of the reaction can be visibly observed. The reaction is completed when the reaction mixture has become homogeneous. Examples of enzymes include acidic protenases such as pepsin protease A and protease B, and neutral protenases such as papain, promeline, thermolycin, trypsin, pronase and chymotrypsin. The pH during the hydrolysis should preferably be controlled in the range of 1 to 3 for the acidic protenases such as pepsin and in the range of 5 to 8 for the neutral protenases such as papain. It is convenient to suitably adjust the pH by the use of an ammonium acetate ammonia buffer solution. The reaction temperature is favorably in the range of 30 to 45 C and the reaction time is ordinarily in the range of 3 to 24 hours. In the hydrolysis reaction with enzymes, the molecular weight of hydrolysate is greatly influenced by the amount of enzyme, the reaction temperature and the reaction time. In order to obtain a keratin hydrolysate with an intended molecular weight, it is necessary to check by gel filtration technique the distribution of molecular weight of hydrolysate in relation to variations in amount of enzyme, reaction temperature and reaction time whereby the optimum conditions are empirically determined. The hydrolysates obtained by enzyme hydrolysis show a narrower distribution of molecular weight than hydrolysates obtained by acid, or basic hydrolysis and contain reduced amounts of free amino acids, thus being more favorable for use as cosmetics. As many as possible disulfide bonds should preferably be contained in the hydrolysates. To this end, it is necessary to use keratin materials of high purity and to effect the hydrolysis reaction under mild conditions. The products obtained by these decomposition methods should preferably have an average molecular weight of 30,000 to 100,000 for the products obtained by the method 1 or 2 and an average molecular weight of 200 to 5,000 for the product obtained by the method 3 . The product obtained by the method 3 is soluble in ordinary polar solvents such as water, ethanol, methanol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol and glycol and can be formulated in a pre shampoo treatment of the present invention as a derivative of keratin material. In this connection, however, the products obtained by the methods 1 and 2 are insoluble in polar solvents and should be formulated after conversion into corresponding base salts. Base salts include salts of alkali metals such as sodium and potassium, ammonium salts, and salts of organic bases such as ethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, 2 amino 2 methylpropanol, 2 amino 2 mercapto 1,3 propanediol, triisopropanolamine, glycine, histidine and arginine. These salts can be prepared separately and then added to pre shampoo treatment compositions. Alternatively, the oxidation product or reduction derivative of keratin material and bases may be added separately to a pre shampoo treatment composition and the salts formed in situ. Examples of the bases include inorganic bases such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate and organic bases such as ammonia, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, 2 amino 2 methyl 1 propanol, 2 amino 2 methyl 1,3 propanediol, 2 amino 2 ethyl 1, 3 propanediol, 2 amino 1 butanol, triisopropanolamine, diisopropanol amine, monoisopropanolamine, lysine, arginine, histidine and hydroxylysine. These bases are preferably added in an amount of 0.1 to 8 equivalents of the carboxyl or sulfo groups in the decomposition product obtained by the method 1 or 2 . Among these components of A , the base salts of the oxidation product of keratin and the derivatives of the mercapto groups of the reduction products of keratin are most preferred. The amount of the component A is, as having defined hereinbefore, in the range of 0.05 to 10.0 wt hereinafter referred to simply as , preferably 0.1 to 2.0 , of the pre shampoo treatment composition. The component B of the present invention are polymers having an average molecular weight of 500 to 5,000,000 and having cationic groups in the main chain or in substituents thereof. Preferable examples are shown below. Examples of these derivatives are those obtained by quarternarizing cellulose ethers such as hydroxyethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, for example, with a cationizing agent such as glycidyltrimethylammonium chloride. Mentioned as a commercially available product is JR 400 molecular weight 100,000 to 1,000,000 Union Carbide CO. . in which R₅ and R₆ are the same or different and represent hydrogen or an alkyl group having 1 to 18 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms, R₇ and R₈ are the same or different and independently represent hydrogen, an alkyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms, or phenyl group, X represents an anion, i.e. a halogen ion such as chlorine or bromine, an anion of an inorganic acid such as sulfuric acid or nitric acid, an anion of an organic acid such as methylsulfuric acid, or a hydroxycarboxylic acid, and n is a value sufficient to give a molecular weight of 10,000 1,000,000. in which m₁ and m₂ are values sufficient to give a molecular weight of 10,000 to 1,000,000, and R₅, R₆, R₇ and R₈ have the same meanings as defined above, respectively . in which R₉ and R₁₀ are the same or different and independently represent hydrogen, an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, or a phenyl group and n and X have the same meanings as defined hereinbefore, respectively .
