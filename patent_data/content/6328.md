# System using integrated circuit chips with provision for error detection.

## Abstract
The invention relates to integrated circuit chips and systems using integrated circuit chips with provision for error detection. Integrated circuit chips may contain an extremely large number of logic elements, but the logic can be accessed only through a limited number of input output pins. This makes the testing of the components of the logic circuits impossibly difficult or impossibly expen sive in the case of very large scale integrated circuit chips. The invention is concerned with the detection and location of errors arising within chips and their various supplies and interconnections. An integrated circuit chip according to the invention has first and second data processing chains 11, 12 having corresponding intermediate outputs along their length which are compared by comparators the logic chains may be duplicate or one may be complementary with respect to the other. Further checking circuits may be provided for the input signals, clock signals and power supplies. The error outputs from the comparators 41 ... 44, 21, 23, 31, 34 may be applied as inputs to an error encoding circuit 28 which generates encoded signals indicating the sources of error within the chip. Further, in a system com prising a plurality of chips with interconnecting means, one chip 54 may be an error handling chip, receiving as its data inputs the error signals from the other chips and being arranged to generate at its output an encoded signal indicating the location of the error within the system.
