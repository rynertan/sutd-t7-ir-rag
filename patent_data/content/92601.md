## Description
COMPOSITIONS FOR UNDERCOATS This invention relates to compositions for under coats and particularly to compositions useful as undercoat materials in forming electroconductive metal coatings over ceramic substrates by chemical plating process. Ceramics inherently have no sensitivity to chemical plating composition. Therefore, it is necessary to activate the surface of a ceramic article by forming a catalyst layer thereon before forming an electroconductive metallic coating over the article by chemical process. Examples of conventional activating processes are 1 a process in which the surface of a ceramic article is sensitized by being immersed in an aqueous hydrochloric acid solution containing stannous salt and is activated by an aqueous solution of palladium chloride 2 a process in which a composition comprising a vitreous powder and a catalytic metal compound such as palladium chloride is applied to the surface of a ceramic article and the ceramic article is baked and 3 a process in which a composition containing no solvent and comprising a thermosetting resin or ultraviolet setting resin and a catalytic metal compound such as palladium chloride is applied to the surface of a ceramic article and cured. However, the ceramic article activated with the process 1 requires the masking of the portion to be uncoated before subjected to chemical deposition.The processes 2 and 3 form a glass or resin layer which is to be interposed between the substrate surface and the conductive metallic coating to be produced by the subsequent chemical deposition. This means that the use of glass or resin results in a limitation on the range of baking temperatures or curing temperatures in activation of the substrate surface, consequently leading to formation of a metallic coating with low adhesion to the ceramic substrate. An object of this invention is to provide a composition for under coats which is capable of activating the desired surface portion of a ceramic article so that an electroconductive metallic coating can be formed on this portion alone by chemical plating process. Another object of the invention is to provide a composition for undercoats which can be baked or cured at suitable temperatures in such wide range for activation when applied to the substrate surface that an electroconductive metallic layer formed by chemical deposition has an improved adhesion to the substrate. A further object of the invention is to provide a composition for undercoats which is able to activate the surface of a ceramic substrate in a simple manner. Other objects and features of this invention will become more apparent from the following description. This invention provides a composition for use as undercoat materials in forming electroconductive metallic coatings over ceramic articles by chemical deposition, the composition comprising a about 0.01 to about 25Z by weight of at least one catalyst component selected from the group of powders of palladium and palladium compounds soluble in an organic solvent or having a particle size of up to about 0.5 vm, and b about 75 to about 99.99X by weight of an organic solvent or organic vehicle for dissolving or dispersing the catalyst component. We conducted research to develop undercoat compositions which can accomplish the foregoing objects.In the course of the research we made experiments in which a ceramic substrate was coated with a composition comprising a commercial metal palladium powder about 0.8 pm in particle size as used in conventional processes and an organic vehicle, and then was baked and a electroconductive plating was formed thereon by chemical deposition. However, the plating formed was found to have low bond to the substrate and to be easily separated, hence unfit for practical use. In further experiments, we discovered that when a finely divided metal palladium is used as an undercoat, a conductive plating can be formed thereon with a satisfactorily high adhesion to the substrate. Our investigation also revealed that similar results can be obtained by using a palladium compound dissolved in an organic solvent in place of the fine metal palladium powder.The present invention was accomplished based on these novel findings. With this invention, it is important that the palladium or palladium compound useful as the catalyst component is soluble in an organic solvent or up to about 0.5 pm in particle size. Examples of useful palladium and palladium compounds are palladium black, palladium sponge and like metal palladium powders palladium acetate, palladium propionate, palladium butyrate, palladium valerate, palladium caprate, palladium laurate, palladium myristate, palladium palmitate, palladium stearate, palladium oleate, palladium linoleate, palladium oxalate, palladium malonate, palladium succinate, palladium glutarate, palladium adipate, palladium pimelate, palladium suberate, palladium azelate, palladium sebacate, and like organic acid salts of palladium coordination palladium compounds or palladium complexes having, as ligand, ammonia, monoethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, monopropylamine, dipropylamine, tripropylamine, monobutylamine, dibutylamine, tributylamine, bipyridine, aniline, paranitrosodimethyl aniline, diethylenetriamine, triethylenetetramine, dimethylglyoxime, ethylenediamine, acetylacetone, etc. palladium chloride, palladium nitrate, palladium oxide and like inorganic palladium compounds, etc. The metal palladium and the majority of the inorganic palladium compounds are usually insoluble or sparingly soluble in an organic solvent and are used as finely divised particles up to about 0.5 pm in this invention.Fine particles of insoluble palladium and palladium compounds may be formed by any suitable conventional process, for example, by a process in which palladium chloride is dissolved in an aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid, the solution is rendered weakly alkaline by adding sodium hydroxide to precipitate palladium hydroxide and formaldehyde in the form of an aqueous solution is added to reduce the hydroxide, whereby fine particles are precipitated from the solvent solution.The organic acid salts, complexes and some of inorganic palladium compounds such as palladium acetate, palladium propionate, palladium stearate, palladium oxalate, palladium malonate and diethylenetriamine complex, dimethylglyoxime complex and p nitrosodimethylaniline complex of palladium chloride are usually soluble in an organic solvent, and therefore commercially available powders of these compounds with a grater particle size are usable in this invention. These palladium and palladium compounds are used singly or in mixture with each other.They are employed in an amount of about 0.01 to about 25Z by weight of the composition. tThen used in an amount of less than about 0.01Z by weight, they give a reduced sensitivity to plating, thereby causing the metal to deposit in an insufficient amount in chemical plating. In excess of about 25 by weight, they increase production costs and also impair the adhesion between the substrate and the deposited metal. The fine powder of metal palladium and palladium compounds insoluble in an organic solvent is preferably used in an amount as small as about 0.01 to about 6Z by weight of the composition, whereas the palladium compound soluble in an organic solvent is favorably employed in a relatively larger amount, i.e. in an amount of about 0.1 to about 25Z by weight of the composition. Usable as the other component for the present composition, namely organic solvent or organic vehicle, are any suitable materials which are able to dissolve or disperse the catalytic metal and which include a variety of those usually used in preparation of printing inks or coating compositions. Exemplary of useful organic solvents are terpenes such as pine oil, terpineol, terpentine oil, etc. esters such as ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, amyl acetate, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate, diethylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate, diethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate, etc. ethers such as diethyl ether, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, diethylene glycol monomethyl ether, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, diethylene glycol monobutyl ether, etc. ketones such as acetone, acetylacetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, etc. alkyl halides such as dichloromethane, trichloroethane, trichloroethylene, etc. aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, xylene, etc.These organic solvents may be used singly or in mixture with each other if required. Organic vehicles comprise at least one of organic solvents as indicated above and at least one of synthetic and natural resins. Examples of synthetic resins are homopolymers and copolymers comprising at least one of methyl methacrylate and butyl methacrylate and like acrylates ethyl cellulose, nitrocellulose, and like cellulose derivatives polyamides, polyesters, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl acetal, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyvinyl butyral or like resins. Examples of natural resins are balsam, copal, rosin, etc. The organic vehicle preferably contains the monomer and or resin in an amount of about 5 to about 25X by weight.The organic solvent or organic vehicle is incorporated in the present composition in an amount of about 75 to about 99.99 by weight. The composition of this invention is easily prepared in the form of a liquid merely by mixing together the catalyst component and organic solvent or vehicle component. The ceramic articles to which the present composition is applicable are not particularly limited as far as they have minute sized dents or indentation over the surface. Such ceramics include sintered bodies of oxides, nitrides, carbides, borides or the like usually used and articles of crystalline glass available under the trade marks Pyroceram , Devitron , etc. Ordinary amorphous glass is not suitable.Examples of useful ceramic articles in sintered form are alumina, mullite, zirconia, beryllia, forsterite, steatite, ferrite and like oxide type ceramics barium titanate, lead zirconic acid titanate and like dielectric ceramics boron nitride, silicon nitride, silicon carbide, titanium boride and the like and cermets consisting of ceramic and metal, etc. The composition of this invention can be applied to ceramic article by known methods such as those of screen printing, brushing method, application by a spinner, immersion method, etc. When the present composition is applied by screen printing, the desired design or pattern can be printed on a given surface portion of the substrate such that a plating can be distinctly formed only on the printed design or pattern area by chemical or electroless plating. The amount of the present composition to be coated on the substrate is not particularly limited as far as it is in the range in which the metal can be deposited in the subsequent chemical plating in a satisfactory manner. The amount of the composition can be suitably determined depending on the kind and amount of the components, application method, etc.Usually the present composition is used in an amount of about 0.2 to about 1 mg caluculated as the metal palladium per 100 cm2 of the ceramic substrate surface. After the application, the ceramic article having the composition coated thereon is heated whereby the organic solvent is removed by vaporization, the resin contained in the organic vehicle is eliminated on decomposition, and, in certain cases, the catalytic metal component is decomposed and or oxidized. The heating temperature is preferably at least about 1500C although variable with the kind of a palladium salt of organic acid or complex contained in the composition.The upper limit of the heating temperature is determined such that the ceramic articles is not deformed or damaged by heating. The catalyst layer formed from the composition of this invention is not deteriorated in sensitivity to chemical plating and in adhesion to the substrate even when heated or baked at a temperature of as high as about 1100 C. Usually the composition need not be heated to such high temperature, with the preferred heating temperature ranging from about 200 to about 6000C. On the undercoat formed by heating or baking the ceramic article and the applied composition, a metallic layer is easily produced in the usual manner by immersing the article in a conventional chemical or electroless plating bath. Useful plating baths include those conventionally used such as an acidic or alkaline electroless nickel plating bath containing sodium hypophosphite as a reducing agent, an electroless nickel or copper plating bath containing, for example, sodium boron hydride as a boron type reducing agent, an electroless copper plating bath containing formaldehyde as a reducing agent, etc. When the composition of this invention is used as stated above, a conductive metallic coating can be easily formed on the ceramic substrate, with the desired design or pattern and with uniform thickness. The bond strength between the substrate and the metal plating layer according to this invention is extremely high as compared with the strength obtained by use of conventional undercoat compositions. The metallic coating is substantially directly adhered to the substrate with only a very thin and discontinuous layer of palladium oxide or metal palladium remaining between the substrate and the metallic coating. The composition of this invention can be applied in a very simple manner with increased operating efficiency. Further the baking temperature is not particularly limited. With use of the present composition, deposition of a plating metal on a desired portion of the substrate, production of resistors, electronic circuits and electrodes for condensers, etc., can be easily conducted within a short period of time.Further according to the invention, metal coating can be uniformly formed with distinct patterns or outlines. It remains to be clarified why the present composition can achieve the remarkable results as described above, particularly the marked sensitization and formation of metal coatings with improved adhesion to the substrate. The reasons may be presumed as follows.Ceramics generally have dents or indentations minute in size over the surface so that the present composition when applied thereto can penetrate into minute sized dents by capillary action. When the present composition thus deposited is heated, the organic vehicle or organic solvent contained in the composition is evaporated off and the palladium compound therein is decomposed or oxidized, leaving metal palladium or palladium oxide which is sensitive to chemical plating. The metal palladium or palladium oxide remains or deposits in minute sized dents over the substrate surface to sensitize the surface to a considerable extent.In the subsequent chemical deposition a metal layer is formed on the sensitized portion of the surface with a remarkable a adhesion by the effect generally known as anchor effect . The application of the present composition forms no glass layer or resin layer between the substrate and the metal plating layer but merely produces a very thin, discontinuous layer of palladium oxide or metal palladium therebetween, as described above. Accoring to this invention, the following great advantages are derived from the absence of the glass or resin layer. 1 The composition of this invention eliminates the likelihood that the resistance to solvent and chemical substance and heat resistance of the article may be reduced by the presence of glass or resin layer used as the binder in the conventional composition and interposed between the substrate and the metallic layer. 2 If a condenser is produced by application of the conventional composition, the glass or resin layer tends to adversely affect its capacity, dielectric loss, etc. However, the ceramic articles treated with the composition according to this invention are free from this tendency. 3 With this invention, there is no possibility that the sensitivity to chemical plating will be reduced by the migration of the catalytic metal into the glass or resin layer. Therefore substantially the whole amount of the catalytic metal used is effectively utilized for chemical plating. The full use of the catalytic metal minimizes the amount of the metal required, thereby contributing to the decrease of production costs. The undercoat composition of this invention can produce outstanding results due to the unique composition which are quite unexpected from conventional compositions. Thus the composition of this invention are extremely advantageous in actual use. This invention is described below in greater detail with reference to examples and comparison examples.
