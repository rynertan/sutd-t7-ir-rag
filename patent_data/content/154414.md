# Round cable adaptor for modular plug.

## Abstract
Adaptor for terminating round multiconductor cable 2 to a modular phone plug 10 comprises a base 30 having a planar portion 38 with comb means 42 upstanding from one end thereof, the planar portion being received in the plug cavity 14 , the comb means 42 aligning individual conductors 6 of the cable 2 with troughs underlying terminals 20 in the plug. When the anchoring member 24 of the plug 10 is hinged down into the plug cavity 14 it captures the comb means 42 in the cavity and presses the conductors against the planar portion 38 .
