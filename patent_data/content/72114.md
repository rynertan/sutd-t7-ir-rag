## Description
Unsaturated Curable Polyester CompositionsThis invention relates to unsaturated curable polyester compositions such as are used in the manufacture of moulded laminated products.Polyester compositions of the kind just referred to are based on a an unsaturated polyester derived from a glycol colnponent, for example propylene glycol, and a dicarboxylic acid component which must include one ha,vipg ethylenic unsaturation, usually an unsa qssrated acid, such as maleic acid, and b an unsaturated monomer copolymerisable with the unsaturated polyester, for example, styrene, methyl methacrylate, vinyl acetate, acrylonitrile. These monomeric compounds are liquids of low boiling point below 1500C , and they tend to evaporate from the compositions during moulding operations, giving rise to significant levels of concentration in the working atmosphere. This is a cause for concern, because inhalation of such monomeric compounds may affect health.The rate of evaporation of a monomer can be considerably reduced by including in the polyester composition a small proportion up to about 2 by weight, and usually 0.05 0.5 of an evaporation inhibitor such as paraffin wax or other waxy material such as stearyl stearate. However, the inclusion of this material is accompanied by a deterioration in the properties of products moulded from the polyester composition, and in particular by a marked tendency for laminated products moulded by the delayed lay up procedure from layers of fibrous material impregnated with the composition, to delaminate when the product is stressed.The present invention provides compositions which, while including an evaporation inhibitor, also contain an additive to reduce the tendency to delamination which the evaporation inhihitor causes.According to tile invention there is provided an unsaturated curahle polyester composition comprising an unsaturated polyester and an unsaturated monomer of low boiling point below 1500C copolymerisable with the polyester, together with a small proportion of an agent to inhibit evaporation of the unsaturated monomer, in which composition there is present as adhesion promoter, in an amount not greater than 5 by weight of the composition, a compound of the formulaEMI2.1 wherein represents H, an alkyl or cycloaliphatic group containing up to 6 carbon atoms, or a phenyl group which may contain 1 or 2 methyl groups as substituents R2 represents H or CH3 X represents H2 H, CH3 CH3 2 or O C3H5 OH represents .CH2.CH OH .CH2 or .CH2.CH CH2OH . andR3 represents an aliphatic hydrocarbon radical, saturated or unsaturated, containing from 5 to 17 carbon atoms.Example of such adhesion promoters are EMI3.1 Preferably, the adhesion promoter is a compound obtainable by the reaction of a glycidyl compoundEMI3.2 with a long chain aliphatic acid R3.COOH. Particularly suitable glycidyl compounds from which the promoters can be obtained are allyl glycidyl etherEMI4.1 and glycidyl methacrylateEMI4.2 These two are the most readily availahle members of the genus D defined above.The long chain aliphatic acid R3.COOH is preferably one containing from 12 to 18 carbon atoms, for example lauric, myristic, palmitic, stearic and oleic acids.Preferably the adhesion promoter forms 0.1 5 by weight of the polyester composition, and a particularly preferred range is 0.5 2. 590 The preparation of suitable adhesion promoters from the commercially available materials allyl glycidyl ether and glycidyl methacrylate will now be described. 1. Preparation from Allyl Glycidyl Ether 160 g 0.8 mole of lauric acid were put into a 500 ml flask fitted with a thermometer, stainless steel anchor type stirrer, nitrogen inlet tube and reflux condenser. A steady stream of nitrogen was passed into the flask, which was then heated so as to melt the lauric acid. 0.125 g of hydroquinone polymerisation inhihitor and 91.2 g 0.8 mole of allyl glycidyl ether were added and the reactor contents were then heated with stirring to 175 180 C. This temperature was maintained for 15 hrs, during which time the acid value of the product fell to 14.6 mg. KOtI g. The reaction was terminated by cooling the flask and its contents to room temperature.A light yellow oil was obtained, with a viscosity at 250C less than 50 centipoise. The oil probably has the structure B which appears earlier in this specification.2. Preparation from Slycidyl Methacrylate Using the same apparatus and technique as described above 140 g. of lauric acid 0.7 mole was reacted with 99.5 g. 0.7 mole of glycidyl methacrylate in the presence of 0.12 g. of hydroquinone for 4 hrs at 130 135 C. During this time the acid value of the product fell to 9.7 mg. KOH g. The final product was a light yellow oil with a viscosity at 250C less than 50 centipoise. This is probably a mixture of isomers, of which C given earlier is one, the other being the corresponding compound containing a primary OII group. An adhesion promoter, such as the product of preparation 1 or 2, can be utilised by including it at a level not greater than about 5 by weight in a conventional unsaturated curable polyester composition comprising unsaturated polyester dissolved in copolymerisable unsaturated monomer of low boiling point and containing evaporation inhibitor. Such a conventional system might be obtained as follows 3. Preparation of Conventional Unsaturated Curable Polyester Composition The following materials were heated together at 200 C until the product had an acid value of 30 50 mg. KOH g. 1.545 moles ethylene glycol 1.545 propylene glycol 2.0 Phthalic anhydride 1.0 maleic anhydride The solid product was dissolved in styrene to form a solution containing 57.5 by weight of resin and 42.5 by weight of styrene, and to this solution was added a conventional cobalt naphthenate accelerator containing 102 by weight of cobalt metal in an amount forming 0.15 by weight of the whole. This is the Formulation P referred to later. Formulation Q was prepared identically except for the additional inclusion of paraffin wax 0.1t by weight of the whole . Formulation Q had a reduced rate of styrene evaporation, but in use it gave laminated products of reduced resistance to delaminatio. Example e 1 The reaction product of Preparation 1 set out earlier was used to make a composition as follows Unsaturated polyester, as before styrene, accelerator 100 parts Paraffin wax 0.1 part Lauric acid allyl glycidyl ether reaction product 1.0 partExample 2The reaction product of Preparation 2 was used to make a composition as follows Unsaturated polyester, as before styrene, accelerator 100 parts Paraffin wax 0.1 part Lauric acid allyl glycidyl methacrylate reaction product 1.0 partTest ResultsFormulations P and Q, and the formulations of Examples 1 and 2, were submitted to a standard test for styrene emission in the absence of catalyst.They were also submitted to a standard test for interlaminar adhesion when used catalysed by a 1 addition of methyl ethyl ketoneperoxide in the conventional construction of moulded laminates from sheets of glass fibre impregnated with the formulations.
