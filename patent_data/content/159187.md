# A SURFACE TOPOGRAPHY MEASURING SYSTEM

## Abstract
A system whereby the topography of a surface may be measured and recorded comprising a laser L producing a narrow beam LO striking the surface at point O , a television camera T capable of detecting the angular bearing of the laser illuminated spot at point O in terms of three dimensional co ordinates x,y, z , and a computer programmed to correlate signals from the television camera as the laser beam is scanned across the surface, thus to produce a reading of the three dimensional shape of the surface. Such a system can be used, for example, for monitoring the surface topography of a stockpile of bulk materials to be harvested so as to ensure optimum perform ance of a material transport system, or to establish the shape of a building or land mass in a surveying operation.
