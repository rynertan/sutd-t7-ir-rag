## Description
COMPOSITE PULSE RADAR SYSTEM HAVING MEANS FOR ELIMINATING INTERFERENCE BETWEEN PULSESBackground of the Invention The present invention relates to a composite pulse radar system, and particularly to elimination of a false image therein. A conventional pulse radar system employs a long transmitted pulse with a large pulse width because it increases the system gain and hence extends the maximum target detectable range. However, a large pulse width prolongs the saturation time in a radar receiver due to the leak of the transmitted pulse which occurs shortly after transmission, and it thereby becomes impossible to detect a target located at a position within the range equivalent to the saturation time. This disadvantage leads to material deficiency in a radar system that particularly requires short range coverage performance. In order to overcome this disadvantage, a short pulse has been used, in addition to the long pulse, for short range coverage. It is transmitted shortly before the transmission of the long pulse. This system is called as a composite pulse radar system. Fig. 1 shows an example of the composite pulse consisting of a combination short pulses S and long pulses L. It may not necessarily be required that the short pulses S be equal in number to the long pulses L or that the width of every short pulses be identical. The interval between the short and long pulses S and L is required to be equal to or longer than the width of the long pulse L. By referring to Fig. 2, description will be made of the relationship between transmission and reception in the conventional composite pulse radar system. For the sake of simplicity, Fig. 2 shows the case where each composite pulse includes one short pulse S and one long pulse k. Fig. 2 a shows the timing of transmitting the respective short and long pulses S and L. The pulse interval AT between the two pulses S and L is set to be a little longer than the width of the long pulse L.Figs. 2 b and 2 c respectively show the video output signals from a short pulse receiver and a long pulse receiver, which respectively receive echo signals E1 for the short pulse S and E2 for the long pulse L.For simplifying the explanation, a delay time caused in the receiver is omitted. The time indicated by r inFig. 2 c represents the saturation time period of the long pulse receiver due to the leak of the transmitted long pulse. It is now assumed a target is located at a short distance given by CT1 2 where T1 T and C is the light velocity from the radar system, hereinafter called a short distance target . An echo signal from the shortdistance target for the long pulse L cannot be detected by the long pulse receiver because it is received during the saturation time T. On the other hand, an echo signalE1 from the short dstance target for the short pulse S can be detected.As shown in Fig. 2 d , the received echo signal E, E1 for the short pulse S is delayed for a pulse interval AT, and the echo signal received during the saturation time for the long pulse L is replaced with the delayed received echo signal E1 to be combined with the echo video signal E2 for the long pulse. Thus, for short range monitoring operation the short pulse video signal is selectively monitored during a time period indicated by H in Fig. 2 b which is shorter than AT, while for the long range monitoring operation the long pulse video signal is selected in a duration B shown inFig. 2 c , thereby the short range detecting performance of the pulse radar being improved. However, the conventional composite pulse radar system still involves a material disadvantage in a case where a relatively large target which strongly reflects radio waves is located at a distance of Cm2 2 t2 t T . In this case, an echo signal E3 from the large target for the short pulse is received during the long range monitoring period B in addition to the echo signal E2 for the long pulse to produce a false image, as shown in Figs. 2 c and Fig. 2 d . In order to prevent this interference between. pulses, it might be possible to adopt a method of lengthening the time interval AT between the short and long pulses or a method of making the respective frequencies of the long pulse L and the short pulse S different from each other. However, the former method involves disadvantage in reducing the number of target hit times tor data rate , thereby lowering the probability of detecting a target. The latter method has disadvantage in broadening the occupied bandwidth of the radar, thereby impairing the effective use of radio waves.Summary of the Invention Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide a system in which any echo signal for short pulse is prevented from interferring with the reception of an echo signal for long pulse without involving any reduction in the number of target hit times and broadening the occupied bandwidth. According to the present invention there is provided an improved composite pulse radar system comprising a pulse transmitting means which transmits a first composite pulse having a short pulse and a long pulse with a first interval and thereafter transmits a second composite pulse having a short pulse and a long pulse with a second interval different from the first interval in a given repeated cycle a receiver which receives first and second echo signals for the first and second composite pulses a delaying means which delays the first echo signal for a predetermined time equal to the interval between the transmission of the first composite pulse and the second composite pulse and a comparing means which compares the output signal of the delaying means and the second echo signal to output a received signal from which a false image is removed. Other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiment thereof, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.Brief Description of the Drawings Figs. 1 and 2 are diagrams showing a pattern example of transmitted pulses according to the conventional composite pulse radar system and timing charts showing the time relationship between the transmitted pulses and the received echo signals, respectively Fig. 3 is a block diagram of one preferred embodiment of this invention, showing an exemplary construction of the composite pulse radar system Fig. 4 shows the time relationship between the transmission pulses and received echo signals according to the embodiment shown in Fig. 3 Fig. 5 is a block diagram of an example of the sweep correlator shown in Fig. 3S and Fig. 6 shows timing charts used for describing the operation of the correlator of Fig. 5. Description of the Preferred Embodiment The preferred embodiment of this invention will be described hereinafter, which is in the case where the respective numbers of short pulses and long pulses are equally one. Referring to Fig. 3, the embodiment comprises a composite pulse generator 7 which generates such composite pulses that the interval between short and long pulses varies in each cycle, a transmitter 8, a radar antenna 9, a short pulse receiver 10 which receives an echo video signal for the short pulse hereinafter called short pulse video signal , a long pulse receiver 11 which receives an echo video signal for the long pulse hereinafter called long pulse video signal , and a video processing section 6 which combines the short and long pulse video signals and eliminates asynchronous interference. In this embodiment the composite pulse generator 7 includes a long pulse generator 71, a short pulse generator 72 end a combiner 73 which combines the outputs of the two generators 71 and 72 to generate a composite pulse.In the video processing section 6, the short pulse video signal from the short pulse receiver 10 is delayed for AT by an delay element 61.A video exchanger 62 selects one of the video signals of the long pulse video signal from the long pulse receiver 11 and the delayed short pulse video signal from the delay element 61 to obtain composite video signal for the short and long pulses. The resultant video signal is correlated with the video signals which have been obtained throughout the past several periods sweeps , so that the ones which are not sufficiently correlated with the resultant video signal are eliminated as interference. As an example of this correlation processing, there is a process of extracting only those video signals that the located in the same position on the time axis throughout the past several cycles and of eliminating any false image that varies in its time position. The operation of eliminating the radio interference between pulses in accordance with this invention will be described with reference to Fig. 4. Figs. 4 a , 4 b and 4 c show the timing of each transmission over three successive cycles. The interval between the short pulse S and the long pulse L is varied each cycle as t ET2 and AT3, respectlvely. Figs. 4 d , 4 e and 4 f show combined video signal for the short and lont pulses corresponding to theo respective transmissions shown inFigs. 4 a , 4 b and 4 c .In this figure, the echo signal for the long pulse L which has been reflected from a target located at a distance of CT 2 whereT aT1, AT2, AT3 Is indicated by E2 with the echo signal false image for the short pulse being indicated by E3 Since the pulse interval between the short and long pulses S and L changes in each cycle, the echo signal E3 for the short pulse S appears in a different position in each cycle, while the echo signal E2 for the long pulse L appears in the same position. Therefore, if video signal correlation over several successive cycles is performed, the false image by the echo signalsE3 can be individually eliminated. An example of output waveforms obtained by the correlator is shown in Fig. 4 g . Fig. 5 shows an exemplary construction of a sweep correlator 63 which correlates the video signals over several successive cycles. The combined video signal for the short and long pulses obtained by the video exchanger 62 is sent out to a comparator 631 in order to identify a desired target signal The comparator 631 provides a HIGH level signl output when the combined video signal is above a certain level or threshold .An output signal A of the comparator 631 is delayed by one sweep or one interval between two transmitted composite pulses T by a sweep memory 632 hereinafter called a delayed signal B , and this delayed signal B is further delayed for the interval of To by the sweep memory 633 to generate an output C hereinafter called a delayed signalC . These signals A, B and C are fed to an AND gate 634.Only when the signals A, B and C are simultaneously present, the AND gate 634 outputs a gate signal G which is fed to a switch 635. The switch 635 is switched over to a terminal a by the gate signal G, and the combined video signal from the combiner 62 is then provided as the output from the sweep correlator 63. On the other hand, when no gate signal G from the AND gate 634 is present, the switch 635 is switched over to a terminal b and no output is generated from the sweep correlator 63.As shown in Fig. 6, only when there is a coincidence in time relationship between the received signal A, the signal B received in the previous sweep and the signal C received two sweeps previously, the switch 635 is actuated and thus produces an output D as the target signal E2 On the other hand, when the three signals do not coincide in time relationship, the switch 635 ls not actuated and no output is produced since the signal is judged as an interference signal E3 or false image . In the method of this invention, as described above, the interval between the short and long pulses in the transmitted composite pulse is varied in each cycle.Therefore, if the received echo signal of each transmitted pulse from a reflecting target is monitored on the basis of the timing of a civen reference transmitted pulse, the received echo signals for the reference transmitted pulse from various reflecting targets appear in the same time position in each cycle so long as the direction of the radar antenna is fixed. However, the received echo signals for other transmitted pulses appear in a different position on the time axis in accordance with the variation in the interval in each transmitted pulse. As a result, a received signal at a random timing in each cycle in relation to the timing of the reference transmitted pulse, or called asynchronus received signal , can be detected and eliminated. It is to be noted that the present invention can be effective irrespective of whether each of .t intervals between the long pulses to be transmitted is equal or staggered. Furthermre, in this preferred embodiment, the number of short pulses is equal to that of long pulses. However, this invention is not limited thereto. In accordance with this invention, in a case where the number of short pulses difiers from that of long pulses as exemplarily shown in Fig. 1, the eliminating radio interference between pulses can be achieved to the same extent as the above nentioned case by the correlating operation of receives video signals over successive cycles on the receiver side. In another case where the frequencies of both short and long pulses are different, strong echo signals exceeding the isolation level of a filter for separating short and long pulses tends to cause interference between pulses. However, ths invention of this applicatIon can be adapted to eliminate such interference as well. As described above, this invention is arranged in such a manner that the interval between the short and long pulses in each composite pulse to be transmitted during one cycle is varied in each cycle and the asynchronous signals in the received video signals are eliminated b comparison of the received video signals without causing the problems of reduction in the number of target hits due to mere lengthening of the interval between short and long pulses or of the broadening of an occupied bandwidth dae to the allocation of two frequencies for short and long pulses as practiced in conventional methods
