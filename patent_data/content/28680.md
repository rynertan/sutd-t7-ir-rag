# Process of, and means for charging an imaging element in an electrophotographic machine.

## Abstract
The charging station of an electrophotographic copier comprises an overcharging corona device 21 followed by a backcharging corona device 22 which is powered to reduce the charge developed by the overcharging corona device. As it passes through the charging station, unwanted residual toner on the imaging element 20 is charged to a polarity such that it is removed from the element during subsequent pas sage of the element through a developing station 26 .
