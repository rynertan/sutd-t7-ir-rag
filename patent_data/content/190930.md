# TRANSIENT VOLTAGE PROTECTION FOR TOROIDAL TRANSFORMER

## Abstract
An apparatus and method for protecting a toroidal transformer from damage due to voltage oscillations and dielectric stresses caused by applied voltage transients is disclosed. Two conductive sheilds are each electrically coupled to a line lead of the primary windings of the toroidal transformer and are disposed around and insulated from the periphery of one semitoroidal segment of the primary windings. A conductive grounding plate is strapped to the outside of the transformer adjacent to and insulated from each conductive shield.
