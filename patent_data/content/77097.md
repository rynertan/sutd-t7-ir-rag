The path of the electrode wheel is controlled during its un rolling motion by a follower involute tooth wheel running without clearance over a narrow involute rack bent into a circle and fixed to the machine. A standard high precision spark erosion machine being used, the feed control is adapted to hold the work piece and to have the electrode wheel at each pass sink itself deeper into the material of the workpiece, as function of the momentary to the set sparking power. The whole width of the teeth is machined in the same operation. The workpiece may consist of hardened or other normally unmachinable material. Especially a crown wheel like involute toothing may be made to co operate with standard involute pinions, maintaining all known advantages of involute toothings, although the shafts are under any angle, including 90 .

## Description
Method and apparatus for manufacturing toothed wheels by unrolling spark cutting. The invention is concerned with a method for the manufacture of toothed wheels by spark cutting, whereby a toothed wheel is used as one electrode with regard to the work piece forming the other electrode and with its toothing a corresponding counter toothing is sparked in the workpiece, whereby the toothed electrode wheel is synchronously unrolled over the surface of the workpiece to be toothed and at every next passage the electrode wheel is brought deeper into the workpiece by a feed device and whereby the extent of the continuously proceeding or per revolution stepped feed is controlled as function of the desired sparking power, and whereby the spark cutting within a given period of time is performed over the total width of the tooth. A corresponding method is described in the DutchPatent Application 284,120 concentrating on the finishing of toothed wheels by means of spark cutting. During the synchronized unrolling of the toothed electrode wheel over the toothing of the workpiece the tooth outline of the toothed electrode wheel is corrected continuously or intermittently by a separate device. As the electrode wheel is also subject to wear, though less than the workpiece, an increasing deviation of the pitch diameter occurs by the applied correction according to said Dutch Patent Application. The toothing made by said method becomes literally a corrected toothing. From said publication dealing with the finishing, it follows that the workpiece has earlier been supplied with a pre finished toothing, either hardened or not.The procedure applied thus relates in particular to an effort to increase the exactness of the toothing in the workpiece. In said publication no indications are given with regard to the type of toothing and the shape of the toothed wheels, while the Figure only shows cylindrical wheels with parallel axes of rotation. The invention relates in first instance to the complete manufacture of toothing by unrolling spark cutting, with particular emphasis on those tooth profles which carrot be manufactured with the well known mechanical cutting methods.Included are toothings made by pre forging of which the mechanical finishing cannot be carried out by usual procedures like grinding or shaving. According to the invention the manufacturing method is characterized in that for the toothed electrode wheel a cylindrical toothed wheel with normalized straight or bevel single or V shaped involute toothing is used. According to a further characteristic the axes o rotation of the toothed electrode wheel and of the workpiece extend parallel to each other so that the workpiece becomes a corresponding straight or bevel toothed involute wheel. The manufacturing method, however, also includes the situation lfhereby the axis of rotation of the electrode wheel and the workpiece intersect or cross each other perpendicularly so that in a side face of the workpiece a corresponding crown wheel like involute toothing is formed bent rack1, , or whereby the axes of rotation of both the electrode wheel and the workpiece intersect or cross each other at any angle between Oo and 900. In order to increase the manufacturing speed at least two electrode wheels can participate simultaneously in spark cutting the circumference and or one or both side faces of the workpiece. Finally it is possible with the above described method to make the toothing as internal toothing in a hollow shaped workpiece by the unrolling spark cutting method. According to all manufacturing methods described above the complete toothing can be made by spark cutting, without applying any pre machining of the toothing. This is of particular importance when materials are applied which are not or only in a very wearisome way machinable with the known cutting methods, like hardened steels, ceramic materials and the like. More in particular, however, the method according to the invention can be applied for the manufacture of toothed wheels with tooth profiles which cannot be manufactured with the known methods based on mechanical cutting like shaving, hobbing, grinding, etc. The Dutch Patent Application 6618198 describes a discontinuous unrolling spark cutting manufacturing method of a rotating punch cutting wheel with cc operating backcut die wheel. Since a straight rack is used, according to this publication, the described method is a genuine unrolling manufacturing method, but an intermittent one.From this publication it is known in itself to make a complete toothing by means of spark cutting. The obtained toothed profiles, however, are back cut, while the manufacturing method is discontinuous and confined to wheels with parallel axes. In contrast to the above, the whole basic form is generated according to the invention, by continuous unrolling and spark cutting from the solid material. With the method according to the invention a very high degree of accuracy can be obtained, especially when, as is known in itself, the ratio of the number of teeth of the electrode wheel to the number of teeth of the workpiece, does not form a whole number. The finishing method by sparking according to the first described Dutch Patent Application 248,120 can be compared in a certain sense with a modified form of running or breaking in. Between the devices for carrying out the above mentioned methods, in the first place that one will be described which is designed for the manufacture of crown wheelshaped internal or external toothings bent rack in one or more internal or external side faces of the work piece.For that it is not necessary that the axes of the toothed wheel and the workpiece intersect or cross each other exactly at an angle of 90 . Use is made of known and renowned machines for spark cutting, whereby the feed device for the control of the electrode with regard to the workpiece takes place as function of the set spark power, compared to the momentary effective sparking power.Such an installation mainly consists of an adjustable spark generator, a frame with linear feed device for the control oi the electrode with regard to the worke e as a function of the set spark power relative to the momentary spark power, a carrier for the workpiece movable with respect to the frame, a container surrounding at least the spark cutting area filled with insulating liquid including a circulation filter system and insulating means between the electrode s and the workpiece including their respective carriers. Apparatus of this kind are made by several manufacturers, amongst whom Agie at Locarno, Switzerland. For the application of the manufacturing method described above, said standard spark cutting apparatus is characterized in that the workpiece is fixedly attached to the feed device and is coaxial with the direction of the feed motion in such a way that the workpiece exclusively performs the depth feed of the spark cutting operation as function of the sparking power, in that the toothed electrode wheel is attached rigIdly to a shaft pinion shaft substantially perpendicular with respect to the centerline of the workpiece, which shaft is supported rotatable and without clearance on a turntable, which in its turn is rotatably without clearance supported and drivable coaxial with the feed motion with respect to the frame but fixed in the direction of the feed motion, in that concentric with the centerline of the workpiece respectively with the direction of the feed motion a circumferential toothed control bush with pitch circle in a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the turntable is fixed to the frame, in which free of clearance a toothed follower wheel pinion meshes, which follower wheel is fixed on the same shaft pinion shaft which also carries the electrode wheel and serves as driving wheel, and in that the transmission ratio between the toothed control bush and the follower wheel is the sane as the ratio between the electrode wheel and the toothing to be made in the workpiece. With said apparatus the whole depth or height of the teeth in the workpiece is made by spark cutting. The feed device takes care of this, correcting itself continuously, in order to maintain the desired spark gap at any given moment. With the described apparatus the aimed purpose is attained, that is the use of a standard spark erosion machine with an addition of a number of simple accessories, thanks to which without radical and expensive modifications or additional components, any given gear ratio can be easily made. For this purpose the toothed control bush, the follower pinion and the toothed electrode wheel are all easily replaceable, easily manufacturable and even available with very narrow tolerances from the common trade. The rotary movement of the turntable imposes its rotary movement around the workpiece to the follower pinion through the pinion shaft which is free of clearance rotatably supported by said turntable. In this way the desired very accurate unrolling movement of the toothed electrode wheel over the workpiece is made possible. According to a further characteristic of the apparatus whereby the follower pinion and the electrode wheel both have an involute toothing, the toothed control bush consists of a toothed rack with small tooth width and involute normalized toothing, manufactured in one plane, which rack subsequently is bent accurately into a circle. The earlier mentioned transmission ratio which may be chosen arbitrarily can thus be realized in a simple way. Further it is of advantage that the involute control bush and the meshing follower pinion have a module different from the electrode wheel, in particular a finer module. On account of both measures a higher accuracy is possible because a larger number of tooth faces of the follower pinion control bush combination give shape to the enveloping plane of the tooth faces to be cut in the workpiece. Then the shaft of the electrode wheel and the follower pinion can be fixed axially in the direction of the centerline of the workpiece and of the axis of rotation of the turntable, by having the follower wheel during its rotation support free of clearance with its teeth face on face on the teeth of the control bush, for example urged by spring force or under its dead weight into mutual engagement. ifl spite of the fact that the control bush in view of its involute toothing can only have a small tooth width, the load on said toothing and consequently its wear is only small. Practically the only load on it is exercised by electromagnetic forces which act between the teeth of the electrode wheel and those of the workpiece.Since furthermore the effective radius cf the control means is larger than the radius on which the machining takes place, on the one hand the strain is reduced whilst on the other hand the accuracy is increased proportionally. Finally the rotational drive of the turntable with advantage can take place independently and not synchronized with respect to the feed motion of the workpiece. This simplifies to a considerable extent the structural embodiment. By this separation a possible source of manufacturing inaccuracies is avoided. In summarizing, the apparatus appears to be simple because the workpiece is stationary during the unrolling movement and is only controlled in a direction of the feed.The toothed electrode wheel performs the whole relative movement in absolute sense, but rotates meanwhile continuously along one and the same fixed track, perpendicular to and concentrical with the feed motion. With the method and apparatus described above, it is possible among other things to manufacture toothings without run out from the full material, also in hard materials. Such toothings have teeth of great strength and stiffness because they remain supported at one or both ends by the mother material. In order to use the full advantages of involute toothing, it is desirable to let run in such a crown wheel toothing involute pinions with a somewhat smaller tooth width than the tooth width of the electrode wheel in order to avoid problems with the axial alignment of the pinions. With the help of the following description of theFigure of a preferred embodiment of an unrolling spark cutting machine for toothed wheels, the inventIon will be illustrated more in detail. lSith reverence 1 is indicated the upper side of a stable and rigid frame of a spmrk cuttlng machine which is not further described In detail. To the frame is attached a stable machining head 2 which is neither described in detail. From the machining head 2 a stable rod 3 extends downwardly, being slidingly supported without clearance for axial movement to perform the feed motion during the machining operation. The rod 3 is locked against rotation and can move only in the direction of centerline 2a The control of these movements takes place extremely accurate and fast, for example by means of a non illustrated stepmotor which controls a pre loaded screw spindle. The workpiece 4 is attached clearance free but removable to the feed rod 3.Schematically the linear feed motion is indicated by arrow A, which motion is given to the workpiece 4 by the feed device. With the toothed electrode wheel 5 its tooth profile is reproduced in the workpiece by sparkcutting. Between the teeth of the electrode wheel 5 and the material of the workpiece 4 at 25 the spark cutting takes place, one pole of a voltage source 6 being connected schematically with the workpiece 4 through a sliding contact 6a and the other pole with electrode wheel 5 through sliding contact 6b. It will be evident that via non illustrated insdated connections the machining head 2 is connected with the frame 1. The spark cutting at 25 takes place in a dielectric liquid 7, contained in a vessel 8. The workpiece 4 is fixed free of clearance but removable to the feed rod 3. For that purpose well known conical spanners 10 are applied, which secure the workpiece concentrically, clearance free and rigidly to the rod by means of schematically illustrated tightening bolts 11. With the same type of spanner 10, 11 the electrode wheel 10 is secured concentrically, clearance free and tight but removable and adjustable on the pinion shaft 12, which in the illustrated example extends perpendicular with respect to the direction of the feed 2a, intersecting the latter.The pinion shaft 12 is supported by bearings 30 and 31 and bearing housings 32 and 33 clearance free and rotatable on the turntable 13 Said turntable 13 consists of a stable gene rally flat plate, which is attached solidly to the end of a hollow turntable shaft 14. Through an upper and a lower bearing 15 respectively 16 the turntable shaft 14 is in a clearance fee way rigidly attached to an extension 17, which extension is rigidly fixed in a hub 18 forming part of the frame 1. The centerline 1a of the shaft extension 17 and thus of the turntable shaft 14 and of the rotation of the turntable 13, is coaxial with the centerline 2a of the feed device and the feed motion A. Around the outside of the turntable shaft 14 a toothed wheel 19 is solidly attached for the rotational drive of the turntable. On this toothed wheel 19 runs a tooth belt 20 which is driven by a schematically illustrated motor 21 which is attached with its mounting feet 22 to an extension 24 of the frame 1. The extension 24 is shaped as rigid hollow cylinder which is also placed concentric with the centerlines Ia and 2a. In the cylindrical extension 24 there is a passage 23 for the tooth belt 20.Arrow B schematically indicates that the turntable with its turntable shaft can rotationally be driven without clearance in the bearings 15 and 16. The vessel or container 8 for the dielectric fluid revolves together with the turntable and is sealed with respect to the turntable shaft 14 by an O ring 37. Around the pinion shaft 12 a distance pipe 34 is fitted.The lefthand pinion shaft bearing 31 abuts with its lefthand side against a shoulder of the bearing housing 33. The righthand pinion shaft bearing 30 is urged to the left by a flange 35 with a certain pre tension, so that the bearings 30 and 31 through the bush 34 provide for an axial and radial clearance free lock up of the pinion shaft 12. With the rotation of the turntable by its driving motor 21 the pinion shaft 12, supported on the turntable, rotates as well, so that the toothed electrode wheel 5 also joins the rotation of the turntable. At the righthand end of the pinion shaft 12, outside the passage through a schematically shown seal 36 through the sidewall of the container 8, a toothed follower wheel or follower pillion 40 is attached in a similar clearancefree concentric rigid but removable way by means of conical spanners 10, 11. The follower pinion 40 also makes a rvolving movement in a horizontal plane perpendicular to the centerlines Ia and 2a during rotation of the tunntable Simultaneously the toothing of the follower pinion meshes with a toothed control bush 44, which is inserted in a concentric circumferential groove 42 in the top end of the cylindrical extension 24.The control bush 44 may advantageously be manufactured as a straight toothed rack and is provided with an accurate normalized involute toothing. The toothed rack with comparatively small tooth width can easily be bent into a circular shape and be inserted in the groove 42 and provides in this way an accurate circula toothing 41 in which the follower opinion continuously meshes during its revolution around the centerline la. The transmission ratio between the control bush 44 and the follower pinion 40 is the same as between the electrode wheel 5 and the toothing 25 to be made in the workpiece. It will be evident that the connecting line between the toothing 25 and the point of meshing of the follower pinion 40 in the control bush 44 intersects the centerlines la and 2a in a point 43 which is also the point of intersection between said centerlines and the centerline of the pinion shaft 12.In order to increase the accuracy the toothing of the follower pinion 40 and the control bush 44 may have a smaller module than the toothing 25 to be made. Further the diameter of the control bush 44 is larger than the diameter of the toothing 25 to be made in the workpiece 4. Because of this tolerances in the toothing of the follower pinion 40 and the control bush 44 are proportionally reduced. It is advantageous to have the follower pinion 40 mesh with its teeth face on face with the teeth of the control bush 44 in order to avoid any clearance in the meshing toothings. For that purpose the support bearing 45 at the lower oxide of the turntable shaft 14 is attached in such a way tat an intermediate axial bearing 46 remains unloaded or carries only part of the weight of the turntable with its accessories. For that purpose the ring 45 can be loaded by non illustrated known means, like a spring or by hydraulic means, so that the follower pinion 40 mess always free oi clearance in the control bush 44. Wfth reierence9itschematically indicated that the machining head 2 controls the feed rod 3 from non illustrat ed external control means, which control the feed A from instant to instant as ftinction of the momentary sparkconditions. Not only a final feed to the full depth o the teeth is attained in this way, but the desired stark characteristics are continuously measured and readjusted. Due to the attacrnient by means of taDered spanners 10, 11, a workpiece 4 can rapidly be placed on the feed rod 3 and be removed after completion. In the same way the electrode wheel 5 and the follower pinion 40 can be fitted and or replaced by other wheels. The circular control bush 44,forming an independent part, can also easily be replaced.The toothing in the workpiece schematically indicated with 25 is illustrated at the lefthand side of the workpiece on its edge. It is, however, also possible to locate the toothing in the full material of the side face, as is indicated schematically with 26 on the righthand side of the workpiece. An extremely strong toothing can thus be made, because each tooth remains connected at both ends with the mother material. It will be obvious that also bevel involute toothings can be made with the method and apparatus according to the invention and that it is not strictly necessary that the axes intersect each other with an angle of 900. Even crossing is possible, while angles deviating from 900 between the pinion shaft with respect to the centerlines Ia and 2a are also possible.
