## Description
SOLID STATE IMAGE PICK UP DEVICE HAVING A HIGH RESOLUTION AND A HIGH SENSITIVITY BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a solid state image pick up device and more particularly to a structure of the solid state image pick up device by which its resolution is improved without impairing its photosensitivity. In recent years, a solid state image pick up device has become more and more useful in that it is small in size, light. in weight, highly reliable and has a long life time, in addition to the fact that it can be fabricated under the same process as a MOS integrated circuit. Solid state image pick up devices are classified into two types those of MOS type and those of a charge transfer device type hereinafer called a CCD type . In either ca se, a principle aim of development currently being carried out is to obtain high resolution and high sensitivity. In order to attain a high resolution, it is only necessary to increase the number of photosensitive elements of the image pick up device, but this causes an increase in the total area of the photosensitive elements on a semiconductor chip, resulting in lowering of the production yield.On the other hand, if the number of photosensitive elements is increased without increasing the total area, each photosensitive element must be made smaller, resulting in a decrease in sensitivity. Therefore, it is a primary object of the present invention to provide a solid state image pick up device having an improved resolution without lowering its sensitivity and without enlarging its area. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to the present invention, there is provided a solid state image pick up device which includes a semiconductor substrate of one conductivit y type, a semiconductor layer of the other conductivity type which is formed on the semiconductor substrate, an insulator layer dividing the semiconductor layer into a plurality of photosensitive element areas, and a region of the one conductivity type formed under the insulator layer, the semiconductor layer under the one conductivity type region being thinner than the semiconductor layer of the photosensitive element areas. Accordingly, since the semiconductor layer under the one conductivity type region forms a potential profile functioning as a barrier against charges accumulated in the photosensitive element areas, charges produced in the region of the semiconductor layer under the one conductivity type region shift to and are accumulated in the photosensitive element areas. Therefore, the charges produced under the one conductivity type region are used to improve the sensitivity. In other words, the areas of the photosensitive elements can be made small to obtain a high resolution without sacrificing sensitivity. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The above and other objects and features of the invention will become more apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein Fig. 1 is a schematic plan view of a CCD image pick up device Fig. 2 is a sectional view showing nah 9f a photosensitive section in accordance with a conventional CCD image pick up device and Figs. 3 a , 3 b and 3 c are sectional views showing a procedure for manufacturing a CCD image pick up device of the present invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION First of all, a solid state image pick up device will be generally explained as an example of CCD image pick up device with reference to Fig. 1. A photosensitive section 1 including a plurality of photosensitive elements Slr S2, S3...Sn 2, Sn 1 and Sn, a transfer gate electrode 3, two CCD shift registers 2a and 2b and an output circuit 4 are formed on a semiconductor substrate. The output circuit 4 may be formed on a different semiconductor substrate, if the CCD shift registers are arranged to externally output an electrical signal. Photo carriers are produced and are accumulated in the photosensitive elements S1, S2, S3...Sn 2, Sn l and Sn, when these elements are exposed to light. After a predetermined time period elapses during the exposure of the elementsS2, S3...Sn 2, Sn 1 and Sn, the transfer gate electrode 3 opens to transfer the carriers accumulated in the respective photosensitive elements to the shift registers 2a and 2b.At this moment, for instance, the carriers in the even , numbered photosensitive elements S2, S4... are transferred to the shift register 2a, while the carriers in the odd numbered photosensitive elements S1, 53.. are transferred to the shift register 2b. Thereafter, the transfer gate electrode 3 closes the gate, and the shift registers 2a and 2b begin to shift the carriers transferred from the respective photosensitive elements to the output circuit 4. The carriers shifted along the respective shift registers 2a and 2b are alternately input to the output circuit 4, which converts the amount of carriers into a voltage and outputs successive electrical signals corresponding to the charges in the respective photosensitive elements in sequence starting from the n th element Next, a conventional structure of the photosensitive section 1 will be explained with reference to Fig. 2 which is a part sectional view along the line connecting respective centers of photosensitive elements S1, S2, 53 . 5n 2 Sn l and Sn. Each photosensitive element corresponds to one of N type regions 9a, 9b, 9c and 9d which are disposed on a P type semiconductor substrate 5. TheN type regions 9a, 9b, 9c and 9d are separated from each other by P type channel stopper regions 8a, 8b, 8c, 8d and 8e and field insulator layers 6a, 6b, 6c, 6d and 6e having a large thickness. It should be noted that all of the P type channel stopper regions .... Se are parts of a continuous region which is formed in a zig zag or serpentine pattern to allow the charges accumulated in adjacent N type regions 9a.. .9d to be taken out in different directions.N type regions 9a, 9b, 9c and 9d are covered by transparent insulator films 7a, 7b, 7c and 7d. The field insulator layers 6a, 6c, 6c, 6d and 6e and the insulator films 7a, 7b, 7c and 7d are typically made of silicon oxide. The P type semiconductor substrate 5 and the N type regions 9a, 9b, 9c and 9d form P N junctions 10a, lOb, 10c and 10d. Carriers produced by irradiated light are accumulated in depletion layers caused by these P N junctions 10a, 10b, 10c and lod. In this structure, there are two ways to improve the resolution. One is to increase the number of photosensitive elements as well as the chip area on which the solid state image pick up device is formed. This technique, however, causes a reduction in the production yield as discussed above. The other technique is to increase the number of photosensitive elements j while decreasing the area of photosensitive element. Although this technique is most likely to realize an improvement in resolution, it is also characterized by a decrease in sensitivity.Here, it is to be noted that there is a limit to decreasing the width of the P type channel stopper regions 8a 8e, because a P chnnnel stopper region having a width less than a predetermined value will allow a channel to be formed connecting adjacent N type regions. Thus, the width of theP type channel stopper regions 8a 8e is usually designed to be slightly above this limit. Therefore, increasing the number of photosensitive elements without increasing the occupation area must be accompanied by decrease in the area of the P N junctions 10a 10d, resulting in the deterioration of sensitivity. Furthermore, a ratio of the junction area to cell area where the cell area is the sum of the areas of the junctions 10a 10d and the channel stopper regions 8a 8e , which is a so called quantum efficiency, would be lowered.This means that the proportion of photo carriers which are produced under the channel stopper region becomes high and, since most of these photo carriers are absorbed through recombination without any contribution to the photoelectric conversion, the photoelectric conversion becomes inefficient. Further, some of these photo carriers are likely to drift to theCCD shift registers 2a and 2b and the output circuit 4, resulting in a deterioration of the coherence of output with the input light information. The photosensitive section in a solid state image pick up device according to the present invention will now be described with reference first to a process for fabricating the section shown in Figs. 3a 3c. At first, as shown in Fig. 3a, a semiconductor substrate 5 having an impurity density of about 1 x 1015 cm 3 is prepared.An ion implanation of phosphorous is effected to the substrate 12 with an energy of 100 KeY and a dose of 1 x 1012 cm . This is followed by an annealing process within a nitrogen atmosphere at 1,100 1,2000C to obtain an N type region 9 having a depth of about Next, as shown in Fig. 3b, an oxide layer 11 having a thickness of 500 7002 is formed on the N type region 9, and a silicon nitride layer 12 having a thickness of 1,000 is formed on the oxide layer 11 by a CVD Chemical Vapor Deposition method. After photo resist layers 13a 13d each having a predetermined shape are formed on the silicon nitride layer 12, the silicon nitride layer 12 is partly etched away by a plasma etching method using a mask of the photo resist layers 13a 13d.This is followed by ion implanation with boron at an energy of 100 KeY and a dose of I x 1013 cm 3 to form P type channel stopper regions 8a 8e. Finally, as shown in Fig. 3c, after tie b ist layers 13a 13d are removed, field oxide layers 6a 6e having a thickness of about l pm are formed in a wet oxygen atmosphere at l,0000C. During this process, the remaining silicon nitride layer 12 operates as a mask for oxidation.This is important in order to retain some thickness of the N type layer 9 under the P type regions. Ba 8e whose positions are lowered as a result of the field oxide layer formation. In the following steps, the remaining silicon nitride layer 12 and the oxide layer 11 positioned between P type channel stopper regions 8a 8e are removed. Thereafter new gate oxide layers 7a 7d of about l,000 are regrown on the surface of the N type layer 9 between the P type channel stopper regions 8a 8e to complete the fabrication. Although the regrowth of the new gate oxide layers 7a 7d may be omitted while instead leaving the oxide layer 11 between the P type channel stopper regions 8a 8e, since the oxide layer 11 is contaminated during the manufacturing procedure, it is preferable for the electrical characteristics of the photosensitive section to regrow the new gate oxide layers 7a 7d. According to this embodiment, the N type layer 9 exists under the P type regions 8a 8e so that the P N junctions between the N type region 9 and the substrate 5 exists not only under the gate oxide films 7a 7d but also under the channel stopper regions 8a Be. Further, since the region 9 is formed under the stopper regions, a P N junction is also formed between the region 9 and each stopper region Sa Se. Since each of these additional P N junctions faces the junction between regions 9 and 5, the potential profile of the N type region 9 between these facing P N junctions has a potential well shallower than that of theN type region.9 between the channel stopper regions 8a Be so that the regions of layer 9 under the stopper regions Ba Be act as barrier regions to prevent carriers from drifting between adjacent photosensitive regions under the oxide films 7a 7e. This shallow potential well not operates as a potential barrier preventing photo carriers produced in the N type layer 9 between the channel stopper regions 8a Be from drifting to the adjacent regions, but also improves the sensitivity.More particularly, the photo carriers produced in the N type layer 9 under the channel stopper regions 8a Be drift to the N type layer 9 between the channel stopper regions 8a Be which has a deeper potential well, and these are collected, together with the photo carriers produced in the N type layer 9, between the channel stopper regions Ba Be. As a result, the light information irradiated through the channel stopper regions, which is ignored in the photosensitive section in the prior art, is effectively used to improve the sensitivity. Due to this fact, the resolution can be improved, without impairing the sensitivity, by increasing the number of photosensitive elements while decreasing the respective areas thereof.Further, since the number of photosensitive elements may be increased without enlarging the overall area of the semiconductor chip, the production yield of the solid state image pick up device is not degraded. Furthermore, the photo carriers produced under the channel stoppers 8a Be are introduced to the N type layer 9 between the stopper regions without free diffusion. Therefore, the photo carriers do not affect the electrical characteristics of the shift registers 2a and 2b and the output circuit 4 Fig. 1 . Thus, an output faithful to the input light information is obtained. It is to be noted that, while the present invention has been described above as an embodiment of a linear CCD image pick up device, this invention can be equally applicable to an area CCD image pic up device or any type of solid state image pick up device having a MOS type structure which has a transparent gate electrode on the gate oxide layers 7a 7d of Fig. 3c.
