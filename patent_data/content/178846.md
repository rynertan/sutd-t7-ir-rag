## Description
SYNTHESIS OF ZSM 23 ZEOUTE This invention relates to a method of synthesis of highly siliceous ZSM 23 crystalline zeolite. Zeolitic materials, both natural and synthetic, have been demonstrated in the past to have catalytic properties for various types of hydrocarbon conversion. Certain zeolitic materials are ordered, porous crystalline aluminosilicates, having a definite crystalline structure as determined byX ray diffraction, within which there are a large number of smaller cavities which may be interconnected by a number of still smaller channels Or pores.These cavities and pores are uniform in size within a specific zeolitic material. Since the dimensions of these pores are such as to accept tr adsorption molecules of certain dimensions while rejecting those of larger dimensions, these ratelials have come to be known as molecular sieves and are utilized in a variety of ways to take adwSge of at these properties Such molecular sieves, both natural and synthetic, include a wide variety of positive ion containing crystalline aluminosilicates.These aluminosilicates can be described as having a rigid three dimensional framework at SiO, andAlO4 in which the tetrahedra are cross linked by the sharing of oxygen atoms whereby the ratio of the total aluminum and silicon atoms to oxygen atoms is 12. The eisctrov lence of the tetrahedra containing aluminum is balanced by the inclusion in the crystal of a cation, for example, an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal cation, This can be expressed by the relationship of aluminum to the cations, wherein the ratio of aluminum to the number of various cations, such as Ca 2, Sr 2, Na, Ir, Cs or Li, is equal to unity.One type of cation may be exchanged either entirely or panialty with another type of cation utilizing ion exchange techniques in a conventional manner. By means of such cation exchange, it has been possible to vary the properties of a given aluminosiicate by suitable selection of the canon. The spaces between the tetrahedra are occupied by mol ecules of water ptior to dehydration. Prior art techniques have resumed in the formation of a great variety of synthetic aluminosilicates, The al uminosilicates have come to be designated by letter or other convenient symbols, as iliustrated by zeolite A U.S.Patent 2,882,243 , zeolite X U.S. Patent 2,882,244 , zeolite v U.S. Patent 3,130,007 , zeolite ZK 5 U.S. Patent 3,247,195 , zeolile ZK 4 U.S. Patent 3,314,752 , zeolite ZSM 5 U.S. Patent 3,702,886 , zeolite ZSM 11 U.S. Patent 3,709,979 , zeolite ZSM 12 U.S. Patent 3, 832,449 , zeolite ZSM 20 U.S. Patent 3,972,983 , zeoliteZSM 23 U.S. Patent 4,076,842 , ZSM 35 U.S. Patent 4,016,245 , and ZSM 38 U.S. Patent 4,046,859 . The SiO2 Al2O3 ratio of a given zeolite is often variable. For example, zeolite X can be synthesized with SiO2 AI2O, ratios of from 2 to 3 zeolite Y, 3 to 6. In some zeolites, the upper limit of the SiO2 Al2O3 ratio is unbounded. ZSM 5 is one such example wherein theSiO2 Al2O3 ratio is at least 5, up to infinity. U.S. Patent 3, 941,871, now Re. 29,948, discloses a porous crystalline silicate zeolite made from a reaction mixture containing no deliberately added alumina and exhibting the X ray diffraction pattern characteristic of ZSM 5 type zeolites. U.S.Patents 4,061,724, 4,073,865 and 4,104,294 describe crystalline silicates or organosilkates of varying alumina and metal content Zeolite ZSM 23 has been previously synthesized in the presence of a nitrogen containing organic cation or template such as pyrrolidine, as disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,076,842, but the synthesis was previously conducted at a relatively limited silica SiO2 to alumina Al2O3 mole ratios of 40 250. EP A 125078 discloses the preparation of ZSM 23 having a silica to alumina mole ratio of 40 to 5000. It has now been found that even higher silica to alumina ratios can be obtained for ZSM 23. Accordingly, the invention resides in one aspect in a process for preparing a ZSM 23 zeolite having an X ray diffraction pattern substantially as that given in Table I, comprising preparing a reaction mixture which comprises sources of an alkali or alkaline earth metal, an oxide at silicon, water and a nitrogen containing organic cation and optionally a source of an oxide of aluminum, the mixture having the following composition, in terms of mole ratios SiO2 Al2O3 above 5000 to infinityH2O SiO2 5 to 200OH SiO2 0 to 0.60Mn SiO2 w 0.01 to 2.0R SiO2 0.01 to 2.0 wherein M is a cation of an alkali or alkaline earth metal of valence n, and R is an organic cation of the formula CH, 2N R, N CH3 2 wherein R, is a saturated or unsaturated straight chain hydrocarbon group having seven carbon atoms, and maintaining the mixture at cry stallization conditions until crystals of the ZSM 23 zeolite are formed. In a further aspect, the invention resides in a synthetic crystalline ZSM 5 zeolite material having in the as synthesized form an x ray diffraction pattern substantially as that given in Table I and having a torroula, in terms of moles of oxides, in the anhydrous state 0.01 6 R2O 0 2 M2 nO x Al2O2 100 SiO2 wherein R2 is an oxide of an organic cation of the formula CH3 3N R1 N CH3 3 wherein R, is a saturated or unsaturated straight chain hydrocarbon group having seven carbon alms and M is an alkali or alkaline earth metal having a valence n, and x is from about 0 to 0.02. The present invention is therefore based on the use of a particular organic template Or directing agent hereinafter referred to as a Diquat 7 cation, during zeolite synthesis.This organic tempiate is derived from the Diquat 7 hydroxide or organic or inorganic salt of Diquat 7. The saits ofDiquat 7 are obtained by reacting a suitable preculor salt containing the functional group R e.g., a heptyl derivative, containing two anions at the terminal carbon atoms, such as, 1,7 dibromoheptane, with a stoichiometrically required amount at trimethylamine to form a diquaternary salt of the organic canon. The synthesis of the original salt of Diquat 7 can be carried out with any organic or inorganic precursor salt containing the functional group R,. The R, group of the organic cation may be heptyl or it may have one or more double or triple unsaturated Thus, Thus, tor example,R, may have one ooubie unsaturated bond, or two or three consecutive or non consecutive double unsaturated bonds, e.g., GH CHGH,GH, CH,CH,GH, , CH2 CH CH CH2 CH2 CH2 CH2 , CH2OH,CH CHCH,CH2CH, , CH CH CH CH CH2 CH2 CH2 , CH CH CH2 CH2 CH2 CH CH , CH CH CH2 CH CH CH CH , CH2 CH CH CH CH CH CH , CH C C CH CH2 CH2 CH2 , CH2 CH CH CH CH C CH . Altematively, the R, group may contain at least one triple unsaturated bond, e.g., C C CH2 CH2 CH2 CH2 CH2 , Or CH2 CH2 C C CH2 CH2 CH2 , In the most preferred embodiment, the R, group is heptyl. The precursor salt contains two anions at the terminal carbon atoms of the functional group R,. Thus, the precur sor salt has a formula A R , A, wherein R, is as defined above and A is an organic or inorganic anion. Suitable inorganic anions are phosphate, halogens, ag., fluoride. chloride, bromide or iodide, sulfate, bisulfate, bisulfite, carbonate, bicarbonate, hexafluorophosphate, nitrate, oxyhalogen, such as chlorate, ClO3 or perchlorate, ClO4 . Representative suitable organic anions are carboxylate, RCOO , amide, RCONH2R, alkoxide, R3CO , or etherate,RO . Suitable alkali or alkaline earth metals are lithium Li , sodium Na , potassium K , cesium Cs , magnesium Mg , calcium Ca . preferably sodium or potassium, and most ably sodium. The synthesis of the Diquat 7 salt is conducted with continuous staring at a temperature of 50 C. to 80 C., preferably 60 to 80 C., at autogenous pressure in a sutabie non aqueotE solvent, such as alcohol, e.g., ethanol, toluene or tetrahydrofuran, until crystals of the Diquat 7 salt are formed, usually for 4 to 24 hoursThe crystals of the product settle to the bottom. the reaction mixture is cooled ag., m a water ice bath, and the product is separated from the reaction mixture by any suitable means, e.g., by nitration. The Crystals are then washed with a suitable solvent, e.g., abeolute ethanol, followed by a wash with an anhydrous diethyl ether. The Diquat 7 salt crystals are then dried. The hydroxide form of Diquat 7 may be obtained in any conventional manner from the salt of Diquat 7, such as by ion exchanging the salt of Diquat 7 with a suitabie hydroxide in any conventional manner, e.g., in an ionexchange column. Any of the conventionai ion exchange techniques may be used to replace the original anions with the hydroxide anion, as will be obvious to those skilled in the art. Representative of such ion exchange techniques are those disclosed in a wide variety of patents, e.g. U.S.Patents 3,140,249, 3,140,251 and 3,140,253. The Diquat 7 salts or hydroxide, when used in theZSM 23 synthesis in the manner described below, disasso ciate into the Diquat 7 cations and the respective anions. The remainder of the components of the reaction mixture are provided by materials which can supply the appro priate oxides. Such materials include aluminates, alumina, silicates, silica hydrosoi, precipitated silica, e.g. Hi Sil, silica gel, silicic acid and hydroxides It will be understod that sech oxide component can be supplied by one or more essential reactants which can be mixed together in any order. For example, the alkali metal can be supplied by an aqueous solution of an oxide or hydroxide thereof, and the oxide of silicon by an aqueous solution of a suitable silicate.The aluminum oxide may be provided only as an impunty in another reactant, e.g., the silica source and in some cases, need not be intentionally added. Where very highly siliceous materials are desired as products, the reactants may be treated to remove at least some alummum removal techniques The reaction mixture can be prepared either batch wise or continuously. Crystal size and crystallization time of the ZSM 23 composition may vary with the nature of the reaction mixture employed. The reaction mixture employed in this method has the following composition, in terms of mole ratios of oxides and ions Broad Preferred Most PreferredSi02 A1203 5000 to infinity 5000 to 20,000 5000 to 10,000 H20 si02 5 to 200 20 to 100 30 to 60 OH SiO2 0 to 0.60 0.10 to 0.40 0.20 to 0.30M SiO2 0.01 to 2.0 0.10 to 1.0 0.2 to 0.8R SiO2 0.01 to 2.0 0.05 to 1.0 0.1 to 0.50 wherein M is a cacn of an alkali or alkaline earth metal and R is the organic cation, designated Diquat 7. Typical reaction conditions comprise heating the foregoing reaction mixture at a temperature of from 100 C to 204 C 212 F to 400 F for a period of time of from 24 hours to 3a days A more preferred temperature range is from 149 C bo 191 C 3000F to 3750F with the amount of time at a temperature in such range being from 24 hours to 7 days. The digestion of gel particles is carried out until cry sEals torn. The solid product is separated from the reaction medium, ina convention manner, e.g, by cooling the reaction mixture to room temperature, filtering and water wash ing. The crystalline product is dried at a suitable temperature, e.g., at 1100C 2300F for from 8 to 24 hours. Of course, milder drying conditions may be employed if desired, e.g., room temperature under vacuum. The resultant ZSM 23 zeolite crystalline product has a charactenstic X ray diffraction pattern, set forth below inTable I.

Other minor variations can occur depending on the silicon to aluminum ratio of the particular sample, and on whether it has previously been subjected to thermal treatment In the as synthesized form, the zeolite has the formula, in terms of mole ratios of oxides, as follows 0.01 6 R2O 0 2 M2 nO x Al2O3 100 SiO2.wherein R is a derivative of the organic canon of the formula CH3 3N R N CH2 3 wherein R1 is as defined above, M is an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal having a valence n and x ranges from 0 to 0.02, for example, 0 to 0.01 or 0 to 0.005. Preferably, y, the mole ratio of SiO2 Al2O3 of the ZSM 23 zeolite, in the assynthesized form, is 5000 to 20.000. The alkali or alkaline earth metal cations of the as synthesized ZSM 23 can be replaced in accordance with techniques well known in the art. at least in part by ion exchange with other cations. Preferred replacing cations include metal ions, ammonium ions, hydrogen ions and mixtures thereof. Particularly preferred cations are those which render the zeolite catalytically active, especially for hydrocarbon conversion. These include hydrogen, rare earth metals, aluminum metals of Groups IIA, IIIB, IVB, VIII, IB, B, IIIA and IVA. Following ion exchange with the desired replacing or tion, the zeolite is preferably washed with water and dried at a temperature ranging from 50 C to 300 C and thereaer may be calcined in air or other inert gas at from 200 C to a temperature below the zeolite decomposition temperature, preferably about 9000C, for periods of time ranging from 1 to 48 hours or more to remove organic material and produce a catalytically active form of the zeolite. Synthetic etic ZSM 23 zeolites can be used either in the alkali metal containing form. the alkali metal form and hy drogen torn or another univalent or multivant cationic form. They can also be used in intimate combination with a hydrogenating component, such as tungsten, vanadium, molybdenum, enium, nickel, cobalt, chromium, manganese, or a noble metal, such as platinum or palladium where a hydrogenation dehydrogenation function is to be performed.Combinations of the aforenoted metals may also be used.Such components can be exchanged into the composition, impregnaled thereon or physically intimately admixed there with. Such components can be impregnated in or on to ZSM 23, for example. by, in the case of platinum, treating the zeolite with a platinum metal containing ion. Thus, suitable platinum compounds for this purpose include Chloroplatinic acid, platinous Chloride and various com pounds containing the platinum amine complex. Combinations of metals and methods for their introduction can also be used.Synthetic ZSM 23, when employed either as an adsorbent or as a catalyst in a hydrocarbon conversion process, should be at least partialiy dehydrated. This can be done by thermal treatment, , La, heating, to a tempera ture in the range of 50 C to 9000C in an inert temperature, such as air, nitrogen, and at atmospheric or subatmospheric pressures for between 1 and 48 hours. Dehydration can also be perFormed at lower temperature merely be placing the catalyst in a vacuum, but a longer time is required to obtain a sufficient amount of dehydration. in the case of many catalysts, it is desired to incor prorate the ZSM 23 zeolite with another matenal resistant to the temperatures and other conditions employed in organic conversion processes. Such matrix materials include active and inactive mateals and synthetic or naturally occumng zeolites as well as inorganic materials, such as clays. silica and or metal oxides.The latter may be ether naturally occumng or in the form of gelatinous preciprtates, sols or gels including mixtures of silica and metal oxides. The use of a matrix matenal in conjunction with the ZSM 23, i.e., combned therewith. which is active, tends to improve the conversion and or selectivity of the catalyst in certain organic conversion processes. Inactive materials surtably serve as diluents to control the amount of conversion m a orven process so that products can be obtained economcal ly without employing other means for controlling the rate of reaction.Frequently, zeolite matenals have been incorporated into naturally occumng clays. e.g., bentonrte and kaolin. These matenals, i.e., clays, oxides, etc., function, in part, as binders for the catalyst It is desirable to provide a catalyst having good crush strength, becauee m a petroleum reiinery the catalyst is often subyected to rough handling, which tends to break the catalyst down into powder like metenals which cause problems in processing. Naturally occur ng days whch can be composited with the synthetic ZSM 23 catalyst include the montmorillonite and kaolin family, which include the subbentonites, and the kaolins commonly known as Dixie, McNames, Georg a andFlonda clays or others in which the main mineral constituents are haibysite, kacinite, dickite, nacnte, or anauxite. Such clays can be used m the raw state as originally mined or inrtially subjected to calcination, acid treatment or chem cal modification. In addibon to the foregoing materials, the ZSM 23 catalyst can be compos ted with a porous matrix material auch as silica alumina, silica magnesia, silica zirconia, silica thoria, silica beryilia, silica trtania as weH as ternary com poe bons such as silica alumina thoria, silicaalumine zirconia, silica alumina magneeia and silicamagnesia zirconia The matrix can be in the form at a cogel. A mixture of these components could also be used.The relative proportions of finely divided crystalline aluminosilicate ZSM 23 and inorganic oxide gel matrix vary widely with the crystalline aluminosilicate content ranging from 1 to 90 percent by weight and more usually m the range of 2 to 70 percent by weight of the composne. The ZSM 23 zeolite is useful in the processes of toluene disproportionation and alkylation, catalytic dewaxing, oletin oligomenzation and aromatization of olefins or paraffins In employing the ZSM 23 catalyst of this invention for okgomenzabon of olefin containing liquid or gaseous charge stock, such charge stocks can be contacted with the catalyst at temperatures of between 288 C and 4s4OC 5500F and 850 F at an hourly apse velocity of between 0.5 and 50 WHSV and a pressure of between 102 and 5617 kPa 0.1 and 800 psig . In employing the catalyst of the present invention for aromatization of gassous or liquid charge stocks which may be olefinic or paraffimc with or without aromatics present such stocks can be arornatzed at temperatures of between 427 C and 849 C 800 F and 1200 F and pressures from 101 to 1013 kPa 1 to 10 atmospheres and space velocrties between 0.1 and 10 WHSV. The following examples illustrate the invention. EXAMPLE A A Diquat 7 dibromede salt was prepared by reacting 1,7 dibromoheptane and trimethyiamine m accordance with the following stoichiometric equation Br CH2 7 Br 2 CH3 3N Br CH3 3N CH2 7N CH3 3Br The procedure used was as follows 150 grams 0.58 mole of 1,7 dibromoheptane available from Aldnch Chemical Company was weighed and trans erred directly to a two liter. three necked reaction flask equipped with a stirrer. 300 ml absolute ethand was added to to the reaction flask while the contents of the flask were stirred contnuousy. Then, 300 grams excess of trimethylamine solution 25 in methanol, ava lable fromEastman Kodak Chemcal Company was transferred directly to the two liter reaction flask. The two liter reaction flask was fitted with a dry ice condenser to minimize CH3 3N loss during reflux. The reaction mixture was reiluxed for about 14 hours to produce white crystals of Diquat 7 dibromide. The reacbon flask was then cooled by immersion in a water ice bath and the product was then filtered on a Buchner funnel. Product crystals were washed on the funnel several times with absoiute ethanol, then severai times with anhydrous diethyl ether. The Diquat 7 dibromine product crystals were dried by air stream on the Buchner funnel after the ether wash. EXAMPLES 1 AND 2 The product of Example A was then used to effect crystallization of ZSM 23 of varying silica to alumina ratio using reaction mixtures having the molar composition shown m Table II below. In Example 1, the silica source was silica so 30 wt SiO2, 70 wt A2O and the aluminum source was sodium aluminate NaAlO2 whereas m Exampie 2 the silica source was HiSil precipitated silica which had been repeatedly acid extrated with HCR to remove aluminum and no aluminum source was added. In each case the sodium source was Na2O, the H2O SiO2 mole ratio was 40 and the reaction temperature was 160 C.
