# RADAR WARNING CORRELATOR

## Abstract
A radar warning correlator is connected in the signal processing chain of an aircraft radar warning system ahead of a final processing computer. An address forming unit 4, 5 forms addresses of records in a first file of a memory unit 3 on the basis of the contents in pulse descriptors comprising parameters characteristic of a pulse in a radar pulse burst sweeping over the aircraft. The address forming unit also forms addresses to records in a second file of said memory unit on the basis of the contents of each separate record of said first file. A correlating unit 9 compares the contents of each pulse descriptor with the contents of a corresponding record in said first file and compares the contents of each record in said first file with the contents in a corresponding record of said second file. A logic unit 9 updates each of said last mentioned contents with each of said first men tioned contents upon the occurrence of correlation therebet ween. A transfer unit 2 transfers the contents of the records in said second file to the final processing computer.
