# Automatic sand box moulding machine.

## Abstract
An automatic sand box moulding machine has a frame work 1 with a hopper 2 to feed sand to a frame 3 and a moulding box 4 . The frame and moulding box are movable towards the top of the framework by a plunger 15 . Between the frame 3 and box 4 can be placed a rack support 11 having a flexible chamber full of fluid, constituting a coun termould. Around the hopper 2 is a compressed air tank 13 con nected to an injector unit 10 to perform a first compacting of the sand in the moulding box. The final compacting is car ried out by raising the plunger whereby the countermould presses on the sand. The compressed air tank 13 can be connected to the frame 3 through telescoping members 17 , and the first and second compacting operations may also be carried out by means of a single block body 25 having an upper injec tion chamber and a lower rack bracket 26 , interconnected by holes 28 .

## Description
AUTOMATIC SAND BOX MOULDING MACHINE Generally speaking, sand moulding in boxes is performed from a moulding box which is closed at the bottom with the model holder plate this box is filled with sand which requires suitable compacting, to acquire the necessary degree of consistency. Normally, the sand loading hopper is displaced from the working vertical where the compacting takes place of the sand contained in the moulding box, which leads to the aforesaid moulding box having an alternating horizontal movement, to place it under the hopper, to load the sand and then to place itself in the working vertical where the compacting has to be performed. On the other hand, there are machines in which the sand is forced into the moulding box by pneumatic drag. This means that the grains of sand have a great impact on the surface of the models generally made of wood , multiplying their abrasive power, with the consequent shortening in the life of models. Sand box moulding machines are also known, in which the sand fills the moulding box, simply falling by gravity and subsequently the final compacting takes place by means of an expan sive wave provoked by the explosion of an inflammable gas in an enclosure provided for this purpose, suitably reinforced and communicated with the moulding box. Obviously, this system calls for very special and rugged installations, to avoid and neutralize the inherent hazards of explosions. The aims of the present invention are basically as follows To obtain very simple machines from the construction point of view, with high performance and reduced dimensions, in which both the loading hopper and the remaining components designed to achieve the sand moulding and compacting are in the same vertical. To obtain machines in which the abrasive capacity of the sand has been cancelled, but achieving the degree of regular compacting desired in each case. To do so, this invention is based on the fact that the sand falls from the hopper by the force of gravity and then the compacting process is developed in two asynchronous or simultaneous stages, with the intervention of a series of basic elements included in the improvements which constitute the object of the present invention. Thus, for example, the final compacting of the sand is performed by the action of elastic means, like a flexible chamber, acting as a countermould. To perform the first compacting, a compressed air injecting unit has been provided which can be linked directly or indirectly to the tank, containing the air this tank is arranged like a casing around the hopper, which is mounted in coaxial alignment with the basic elements and the general frame work of the machine. The indirect relationship between the tank and the injector unit is determined through a telescopic connection. The compressed air injector unit can comprise a singleblock body with a rack bracket which forms the flexible chamber acting as a countermould.

Figure 11 is a schematic elevation view of the machine at rest, according to an embodiment variation, in which the inclusion of a single block body has been foreseen, acting as an injection unit and as a rack bracket of the flexible chamber, thus enabling the compacting stages to be performed simultaneously. Figure 12 represents very schematically a work cycle stage with the single block body and the hopper gate in reverse.Figure 13 represents the development of the compacting stages which, because of the structural solution proposed, can be performed either in asynchronized stages or in simultaneous stages.In accordance with the invention, the automatic moulding machine is made up from a general framework 1 on which a sand feeding hopper 2 is arranged in coaxial alignment. The sand can fall by the force of gravity, after a gate 20 Figure 6 as been withdrawn by a cylinder 21, on an assembly formed by a frame 3 and a moulding box 4, which both correspond perimetrically.The frame 3 is supported by conventional rests, while the box 4 rests on conveyor rollers 5 under whose level a model holder plate 6 is arranged at rest. The plate 6 is supported on a rack 7 through which an hydraulic cylinder 8 projects. At its end the cylinder is provided with a platform 9 on which the plate 6 can rest when the cylinder 8 is driven, its plunger 15 Figs. 2 and 3 pushing it upwards, to force the box 4 in turn and the frame 3 until the assembly touches the top part of the framework 1 Fig.2 . The inclusion of a rack support 11 is shown in Figs 2 and 3, the rack support being provided with a flexible chamber, like a countermould, which is full of fluid 12 , preferably liquid, this chamber being formed by a rubber type casing. The rack 11 can be placed inside or outside the framework 1.The hopper 2 is surrounded over part of its height by a compressed air tank 13, provided with a valve 14 through which the air passes directly into an injector unit 10, to perform the first compacting of the sand Fig.2 , subsequently discharging the surplus air through a valve 16.To perform the final compacting, the countermould 11 is inserted between the frame 3 and the box 4 so that through the upward thrust of the plunger 15 the whole assembly presses against the top part of the framework, to cause the countermould 11 to press against the sand in the box 4, thus performing the final constant compacting.According to Figure 4, an embodiment is shown in which the frame 3 and the countermould 11 are joined together at the side in an aligned arrangement, this assembly resting on a roller platform 30 so that the entry of one into the framework causes the other to leave, and vice versa.According to Figures 6 to 10 an embodiment is shown in which there is a connection between the compressed air tank 13 and the frame 3, comprising telescopic members 17, the lower one of which is jointed to the side of the frame by the shape of an injection chamber 19, encasing the frame, through which chamber compressed air passes from the tank 13 through a valve 18 to reach the inside of the frame, to perform the first compacting stage, Fig.7 , the latter being closed by the countermould 11 and being ready to perform the final compacting Fig.8 , once the surplus air has been ejected by the valve 16 Fig.9 .This frame 3 is provided with lugs 23 Fig.10 with respective holes 24 as means for guiding the former through vertical columns of the framework 1. With regard to Figure 11, it can be seen that a single block body 25 has an injection chamber in its upper portion, and at its lower portion forms a rack bracket 26 suitable for housing a plurality of hydraulic cylinders 27 acting as a countermould, with their pistons preferably protruding from the said rack support, which is intercommunicated with the injection chamber through the holes 28, making a quick airtight join between the single block body and the tank 13 through the telescopic connection 17, with its respective inlets 29 fitting into each other, to allow the flow of compressed air for the first compacting, which can be performed simultaneously with the final compacting, because of the air reaching the cylinders 27 of the rack 26 Figs 12 and 13 .
