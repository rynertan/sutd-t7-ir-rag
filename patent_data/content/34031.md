# Electricity meters.

## Abstract
An electricity meter for metering the amount of electrical energy supplied by a power supplier to a power consumer is provided with means for detecting the presence of an external shunt 50 which has been connected to by pass its internal current sensing means 22 . The detecting means, which in one embodiment comprises a differential current sensor 32, 34 for sensing the difference between the respective currents flowing to and from the consumer via the meter, is arranged to operate a circuit breaker 44 and or to compensate the ener gy measurement of the meter, and or to provide a warning to the supplier. The differential current sensor also senses when current is being taken between the live wire and earth on the consumer s side of the meter.
