# Test pattern generator.

## Abstract
In a main pattern memory 12, 13, 14 are stored an increment command pattern and an enable control pattern in addition to test patterns. The main pattern memory is read out with an address from an address control circuit 11 . The increment command pattern thus read out of the main pattern memory instructs incrementing of an address pointer 15 , and a partial pattern memory 16 is read out according to the contents of the address pointer. In accordance with the enable control pattern read out of the main pattern memory, a gate circuit 17 is controlled to open, through which the output of the partial pattern memory is passed, and bits of the passed output are each ORed, by an OR circuit 18 , with the corresponding bits of the test pattern read out of the main pattern memory, providing the ORed output as a test pattern.
