# ANALOGUE WAVE FILTER DEVICE

## Abstract
An RC active filter device which is implemeted with integrated circuit technology. Each RC filter element of the device has a distributed series resistance and a distributed shunt capacitance. The series resistance is formed by a strip of resistive material which overlies a resistive plate or substrate with an intervening insulating layer to form the shunt capacitance. The filter device can be designed to have a pass band ripple response which is not affected by variation in nominal absolute resistance and capacitance values resulting from process spreads. These variations only stretch or compress the filter response along the frequency axis. The filter device shown in Figure 2 comprises three RC filter elements 1, 2 and 11, and an operational amplifier 3. The RC filter elements 1 and 2 determine a low pass band. The filter element 11 prevents high frequency components outside the low pass band being leaked directly to the filter device output.
