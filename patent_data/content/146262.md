## Description
This invention relates to optical amplifiers, and in particular to means and methods for amplifying an optical signal without having to convert it to an electrical signal. According to one aspect of the invention there is provided an optical amplifier comprising a length of optical fibre a semiconductor laser and drive means therefor, the output of the semiconductor laser. comprising a pulsed pump signal and coupler means having an input for an optical signal, of a first wavelength, to be amplified, an input for the pump signal and an output coupled to an input end of the optical fibre, and wherein in use the fibre is optically pumped by the pump signal at a second wavelength and gain is obtained due to Raman stimulated emission, at the first wavelength in the signal to be amplified, which first wavelength corresponds to one or more Stokes shift s from the pump signal. According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of amplifying a first optical signal of a first wavelength comprising the steps of generating a pulsed pump signal at a second wavelength by means of a semiconductor laser, and synchronously coupling the first optical signal and the pump signal into a length of optical fibre, the first wavelength corresponding to one Stokes shift from the pump signal wavelength, Raman stimulated emission in the optical fibre serving to induce gain in the first optical signal. Embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Stimulated Raman scattering in low loss optical fibre waveguides has attracted considerable attention owing to the high efficiency of generation of multiple Stokes frequency shifts. This effect has been utilised to provide a pulsed tunable source for fibre diagnostic measurements Cohen L.G. and Lin C., A universal fibre optical UFO measurement system based on a new IR fibre Raman laser IEEE J. Quantum Electron., 1979, 14, p 855 but the direct application of this mechanism for producing amplification of the transmitted signal in a fibre has only recently been investigated. Results have been obtained showing substantial amplification in GeO₂ doped SiO₂ fibres at 1.064 µm micron Ikeda M., Stimulated Raman amplification characteristics in long span single mode silica fibres.

Electronics Letters 1983, Vol 19, 16, p 620 . A major factor in the design of optical fibre communications systems is the necessity to employ signal repeaters regenerators at intervals. If, however, the optical signal can be amplified optically by applying a pump signal to induce stimulated Raman scattering at an end of the link the length of the link between any necessary regenerators can be greatly extended. The amplification results mentioned above for 1.064 micron and 1.24 micron were based on the use of a pump signal provided by a Q switched YAG yttrium aluminium garnet laser and GeO₂ doped SiO₂ single mode fibres at power levels in the vicinity of a stimulated Raman scattering threshold power of 1.2W, and 0.5 to 5W a forward Raman gain of 45 dB being measured at 2W , respectively. We have, however, observed optical amplification in GeO₂ doped SiO₂ single mode fibre at several discrete wavelengths covering the range 1.12 to 1.356 micron with very much lower pump power levels. Amplification by stimulated Raman emission was obtained using the output from a broad band Raman fibre laser to provide both a pump to an amplifier and a signal to be amplified. A schematic arrangement of the equipment employed is shown in Fig. 1. A Q switched neodymium doped YAG laser 1 emitting at 1.06 micron was employed to pump a Raman fibre laser comprised by a low loss 80 m length of single mode GeO₂ doped SiO₂ optical fibre 2 having a core diameter of 5.1 micron and an index difference of 1.3x10 Using the arrangement illustrated in Fig. 1 gain in the amplifier fibre 4 was observed at all of the Stokes orders emerging from Raman laser fibre 2 by pumping at the wavelength corresponding to the preceding Stokes order. The transmitted pulse was observed with and without the presence of the pump signal. In one case pumping was also performed at a wavelength corresponding to two preceding Stokes orders. Owing to the efficient generation of multiple or Stokes lines in the Raman fibre laser 2, when the stimulated emission threshold is exceeded for each order, power from the preceding order is depleted. However, to observe the maximum gain in the amplified fibre 4 it is necessary to have the maximum power at the pump wavelength λ To determine that gain saturation had not occurred at the signal wavelength of 1.18 micron where the maximum amplification was observed, the input pump power was varied using an attenuator, and the amplification plotted against amplifier input pump power, see Fig. 3. The plot of Fig. 3 shows no trend towards saturation and much higher gains would, therefore, be expected before saturation is reached, which is confirmed by the 45 dB at 1.24 micron, quoted above, obtained by Desurvire et al. However, the pump power levels we have employed are significantly lower than those employed before and we have still obtained useful amplification factors. Whereas the above has so far related only to single mode amplifier fibres, we have found that amplification can also be achieved with multimode fibre. For example, in a 500 m length of multimode fibre having a numerical aperture NA of 0.3, an amplification of 15 dB was obtained at 1.3 micron wavelength for an input pump power of 140 mW peak. For reasons of lack of compatibility with existing optical fibre systems and from practical considerations, YAG lasers are not suitable for use as the pumps. However, until now relatively high pump powers were apparently necessary to obtain amplification. We have shown that this is not so. In a particular test, the pump power launched into the amplifier was measured at a pump wavelength of 1.30 micron and an amplification of 5 dB was observed at a signal wavelength of 1.36 micron. The peak power emerging from a short cladding mode stripped length of the amplifier was measured using an Anritsu ML93A calibrated power meter and found to be as low as 80 mW. This result means that with optimised launch and drive conditions amplification is possible with pump sources comprised by semiconductor lasers, for example GaInAsP for use in the range 1.0 to 1.8 micron or lead salt for mid I.R. applications. Now, the amplifier fibre requires, for optimum amplification performance, to have a high Raman cross section, and a low transmission loss. GeO₂ doped SiO₂ fibre has a high Raman cross section depending on the amount of GeO₂ dopant in comparison with undoped SiO₂ fibre, however pure GeO₂ fibre has a Raman cross section ten times higher than undoped SiO₂ fibre, although the transmission losses are higher than for undoped SiO₂ fibre. In the case of liquid filled fibre employing bromine, the Raman cross section is 2400 times greater than for undoped SiO₂ fibre. It is thus proposed to construct an optical amplifier with the basic structure illustrated in Fig. 4. It comprises a semiconductor laser 11 with appropriate drive circuitry to provide a pulsed output and used as a pump, a coupler 12 wherein an optical signal 13 to be amplified is coupled with a pump signal 14 output from laser 11 and a length of optical fibre comprising an amplifier fibre 15.
