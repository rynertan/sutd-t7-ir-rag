# Fluid supply systems.

## Abstract
The fluid supply system comprises a multi charge solid propellant gas generator and a fluid expulsion unit integrated into a single unit, the gas generator being pro vided in a cap 8 for a chamber 1 having a gas portion 3 and a fluid portion 2 and a movable partition 4 between these two portions operable to expel fluid from the chamber when the gas generator is rendered operative. The system also comprises ignition control means 22 operable to control the ignition of the solid propellant charges 13 when required to give a fully controllable system output. The system can be designed for supplying under pres sure fluids such as hydraulic oil, fuels, oxidents and water and is particularly useful in aerospace applications.
