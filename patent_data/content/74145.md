# Fractionation of fats using a liquefied gas or a gas in the supercritical state.

## Abstract
A process for producing a mixture of triglycerides displaying butter like properties by fractionating fats with a liquefied gas or a gas under supercritical conditions. Said mixture of triglycerides predominantly consists of triglyce rides with a carbon number ranging from 24 to 42 and can be used as one of the fat components of a margarine fat blend in order to improve its butter like properties.
