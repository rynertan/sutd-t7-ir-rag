# A method and device for adjusting the cooling temperature of a sample trap in an apparatus for gas chromatographic analysis.

## Abstract
This invention concerns a method and a device to perform the adjustment of the cooling temperature of a trap for samples in an apparatus of gas chromatographic analy sis. The method according to the invention is characterized in that the cooling fluid flow fed to the trap is adjusted by varying the vacuum caused by a suction device downstream the trap, which is capable of sucking the cooling fluid from a vessel upstream the trap itself. The device according to the invention is characterized in that it comprises a suction means placed downstream the trap and connected by means of a first duct to an end of the trap itself, the other end of the trap being connected, by a second duct, to a vessel containing the refrigerating fluid.
