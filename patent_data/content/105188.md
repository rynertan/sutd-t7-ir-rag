## Description
Aj TITLE OF THE INVENTION Panel Support Assembly ForConcealed Fastener Roof Structure B CROSS REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS IF ANY None C BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Fei of the Invention This invention relates to concealed fastening roof structures, and more particularly to improved panel support assemblies which provide consistent and accurate control of the panel module during erection, and which permit two or more courses of the panel members to move as a unit during thermal expansion and contraction. 2. Description of the Prior Art Virtually all profiled panel members are fabricated by roll forming operations to established manafacturing tolerances to provide, for example, a 36 91,4 cm coverage width. However, the actual coverage width of the panel members may deviate from the intended 36 coverage width, by as much as 3 16 0.476 cm . The deviations may be caused by clearances in the rolls of the roll forming equipment, which is necessary to accommodate various gauges of the sheet metal and decorative coating thickness and by coil to coil variations in the pKyfLval properties of the steel.These roll clearances and the physical property variations introduce varying degrees of permanent set and spring back in the material being roll formed thereby causing variations in the final shape of the ribs, and hencer in the coverage width. Since the panel coverage cannot be precisely controlled at the time of manufacture the roof installation must be engineered assuming a 36 coverage width. The panels must be installed so as to provide the 36 coverage width regardless of the actual manufactured panel width. This is normally accomplished in profiled panel members by moduling the panel member, that is by physically stretching or compressing the panel member to conform its width to the engineered width. Concealed fastening roof systems are known which employ locator strips for precisely locating the concealed fasteners at a uniform spacing, see for example U. S. Pat.Nos. 3,715,958 SCRIVNER and 4,285,182 DINGES . In erecting such systems, the erector can only maintain the intended panel module. The modular width of the panel cannot be adjusted to accommodate differences between the as engineered dimensions and the as built dimensions of the steel framing. My copending application serial number 367,169 filedMay 7, 1982 and assigned to the assignee of this invention, discloses and claims a system by which moduling of the panel members may be consistently and accurately achieved.The system utilizes one fixed clip and two or more floating clips per panel member. The disclosed system relies on precisely locating the fixed clips to achieve the desired moduling of the panel members. The present invention constitutes an improvement over the aforesaid copending application serial number 367,169, in that the present invention provides a means for varying the distance between the fixed clips during erection of the roof structure so as to accommodate the panel coverage to the coverage required by the erected steeir framework. In conjunction with the above noted erection requirements, the concealed fastening system also must allow the panel members to undergo thermally induced movement, that is to move as a unit during thermal expansion and contraction.Certain profiled panel members of simplified design, may be roll formed at the job site to any required length. Such single length panel members may not be subject to buckling or seal rupture during thermal movement provided that the panel members are secured to the structural steel by suitable concealed fasteners. Most concealed fastening roof systems utilize panel members whose length is limited by plant space, handling or shipping limitations. Such limited length panels are erected in multiple courses which present lap joints wherein the panel ends of one course overlap those of the adjacent course. At the lap joint, the panel ends tend to move in opposite directions for a given thermal condition. Such movement may shear the sealant line, elongate fastener holes or sheasters ers all of which tend to degrade the lap joint seals and to produce undesirable leaks in the roof structure. Ideally, the multiple panel lengths should be joined in such a way that the multiple lengths respond to thermal inputs as would a single elongated sheet.This requires the lap joint condition to move as a unit and in a single direction rather than having the panel ends move in opposite directions. Many concealed fastening systems ignore thermally induced movement at the lap joints. In other systems, the lap joint is spaced from the adjacent panel support assembly or the purlin so that the lap joint fasteners can move with the lap joint independently of the support. This approach results in an inherently weak end lap for one or more of the following reasons. The concealed fastener must physically contact the panel member in der to lchor it to the structural steel. Such contact results in frictional drag as thermal conditions cause the panels to expand and contract and slide past the concealed fastener. If the frictional resistance of the concealed fasteners on opposite side of the lap joint differ substantially, the panel ends undergo different rates of thermal expansion whereby the panel ends move in opposite directions. The end result is the same.That is, such movement may shear the sealant line, elongate fastener holes or shear fasteners thereby degrading the lap joint seal and causing undesirable roof leaks. As a further consideration, locating the end lap condition away from the support drastically increases the likelihood of damage to the lap joint fastening and to the sealant due to foot traffic and other live loads since no firm foundation exists beneath the lap joint to resist these forces In addition, locating the lap joint condition away from a support creates a weak line of bending resistance since the overlapped sheets cannot be clamped effectively enough to produce the equivalent bending resistance of an unbroken sheet section. D SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The principal object of this invention is to provide an improved panel support assembly which facilitates moduling of the panel members and which allows problem free thermal expansion and contraction of the assembled panel members. Another object of this invention is to provide an improved panel support assembly having means for setting the depth of telescoping engagement between adjacent panel support assemblies whereby columns of the support assemblies may be erected with corresponding ends thereof in substantial alignment. Still another object of this invention is to provide an improved support assembly to which overlapped ends of adjacent panel courses are fixedly secured and which will accommodate thermally induced movement of the panel members relative to the structz steel. The present invention provides an improved panel support assembly including a subgirt having first and second ends adapted for telescoping engagement with the second and first ends of adjacent subgirts. Cooperating aperture sets are provided, one set at the first end and the other set at the second end, for setting the depth of engagement of the countersunk second end with the first end of the adjacent subgirt. Locking means are provided for locking the first and second ends of adjacent subgirts in adjusted relationship.The arrangement is such that an array of rows and columns of the support assemblies may be erected, wherein each of the rows comprises a plurality of the support assemblies erected iz first end to second end telescoping engagement with the second ends of corresponding subgirts of each column substantially aligned along an imaginary line extending transversely of the rows. As will be explained more fully later in the specification, each support assembly of certain rows, is provided with one fixed clip means and plural movable clip means for connecting the panel members to the support assembly. The incremental adjustments provided by the cooperating aperture sets allows the panel member coverage to be adjusted to accommodate differences between the as engineered dimension and the as built dimension of the steel framing. That is, any necessary ldiustments can be predeterm ad by field measurement Oj the erected steel framing. hus the erector has precise control over the erected panel module and permits the required module to be predetermined prior to the start of erection rather than reacting during construction to module problems as they occur. The present invention also provides an improved support assembly comprising a stand off support having an upper support flange, an elongated subgirt having spaced apart outwardly directed subgirt flanges extending transversely of the upper support flange, and connecting means slideably connecting the subgirt to the upper support flange. A plurality of the support assemblies may be erected in endto end telescoping engagement to provide an intermediate row of the support assemblies to which the overlapped ends of adjacent courses of panel members are fixedly secured. The arrangement permits the overlapped ends and the subjacent subgirts to move as a unit relative to the stand off supports under various thermal conditions, without elongating the fastener holes, without rupturing the lap seal, and without introducing regions incapable of supporting foot traffic and other live loads. The present invention also provides improvements in a roof structure having spaced apart generally parallel purlins.Thermal insulation overlies the purlins. An array of rows and columns of panel support assemblies are provided including a first row extending along a first purlin, a second row extending along a second purlin which is spaced from the first purlin, and plural intermediate rows, one extending along each of the remaining purlins. Plural side overlapped panel members are provided, extending between the aforesaid first and second rows. The panel members have a panel width substantially equal to a selected modular width. In accordance with the improvement of this invention, the panel support assemblies of each of the rows comprises plural end to end connected sibgirt3, each having a stand off support connecting the subgirt to the subjacent purlin.Each of the panel support assemblies of the first row includes connecting means slideably connecting the subgirt to the associated stand orr support whereby the subgirts are capable of undergoing movement transversely of the associated purlin and parallel to the plane of the roof structure during thermal movement of the panel members connected thereto. The subgirts of the remaining support assemblies are fixed relative to the associated stand off supports. First fastening means is provided fixedly securing the panel members to the support assemblies of the second row. Second fastening means is provided fixedly securing. the panel members to the support assemblies of the first row.Concealed fastening means is provided mounted on the support assemblies of each of the remaining rows, slideably connecting the panel members to the subjacent support assemblies The overall arrangement is such that while the panel members are fixedly secured to the support assemblies of the second row, the panel members are free to undergo thermal expansion and contraction.

F DESCRIPTIO OF TED PREFERRED EMBODIMENT S FIGURE I illustrates a building 30 having a roof structure 32 constructed in accordance with this invention. The roof structure 32 may comprise a double pitched roof including sloped portions, each having opposite ends 34, 36 and opposite sides 38, 40. The opposite sides 38, 40 correspond to the ridge and the eave of the roof. Each of the sloped portions includes first and second courses 42, 44 of panel members 46, 47. The panel members 47 of the second course 44 overlap the panel members 46 of the first course 42 to form a lap joint 48. Before installation begins, the roof framing is checked for sq lreness, overall dimensions and eveness of r lane. Differences between the as built dimensions and the as engineered dimensions can, as will become apparent later in the specification, be compensated for by adjusting the module of the panel support assemblies which, in turn, will adjust the coverage of the panels 46, 47. A few examples will illustrate the capability in the present system to accommodate differences between the as built dimensions and the as engineered dimensions. Let us assume that in the building 30, the engineered dimension of the ridge length R and of the eave length E is 102 feet 31.09 M and that thirty four of the panel members 46, 47 are required for each course, each having a nominal coverage width o 36 91.44 cm . Example I Field measurements determine that the ridge and eave lengths R, E equal 101 8 30.99 M . Thus, the panel members 46, 47 must be shrunk 4 10.16 cm . By adjusting the module of the panel support assemblies, thirty two runs of the panel members 46, 47 may be erected at a modular width of 35 7 8 91.12 cm and two runs of the panel members 46, 47 may be erected at a modular width of 36 91.44 cm . Example II Field measurements indicate that the ridge and eave lengths Rand E equal 102 3 31.17 M . Thus, the panel members 46, 47 must be stretched 3 7.62 cm . By adjusting the module of the panel support assemblies, twenty four runs of the panel members 46, 47 may be erected at a modular width of 36 1 8 91.76 cm and ten runs of the panel members 46, 47 may be erected at a modular width of 36 . Example III Field measurements indicate that the ridge length is 102 4 31.19 M and that the eave lengthE is 101 8 30.99 M . During erection, the upper ends of the panel members 47 must be stretched 4 10.16 cm at the ridge, while the lower ends of the panel members 46 must be shrunk 4 10.16 cm at the eave. By adjusting the module of the support assemblies, thirty two runs of the panel members 46, 47 may be installed having a modular width at the ridge of 36 1 8 91.76 cm and a modular width at the eave of 35 7 8 86.1 cm . Two runs of the panel members 46, 47 may be erected at a modular width of 36 91.44 cm . The sequence of erecting the present roof structure will be illustrated with reference to FIGURES 2 through 7. Referring to FIGURE 2, the steel framing of the building 30 includes spaced purlins 50 extending between the opposite ends 34 36 parallel with the opposite sides 38, 40.Thermal insulation 52 is laid across the purlins 50 from the ridge 38 to the eave 40, and properly tensioned by means not iflustratel The presentvsystem incorporates three distinct types of panel support assembly, that is a fixing support assembly designated by the suffix F, to which panel member ends are fixedly secured a clipping support assembly designated by the suffix C, to which panel members are slideably connected by fixed and movable clip means and a sliding support assembly designated by the suffix S, to which overlapped panel member ends are fixedly secured and which allow thermal movement of the lap joint. A column 53 of starter support assemblies 54 is provided, including one fixing assembly 54F, one sliding assembly 54S, and plural clipping assemblies 54C. Each starter assembly 54 having a length, for example, of 6 54.24 cm , is carefully installed adjacent to the roof end 34 at the prescribed location and in alignment with all other starter assemblies.To assure alignment, the fixing assembly 54F is secured to the purlin 50 at the ridge 38 and one of the clipping assemblies 54C is secured to the purlin 50 at the eave 40. The remaining starter assemblies 54 may be aligned using, for example, a string 56 extending between the corresponding ends of the fixed and clipping assemblies 54F, 54C. Exact positioning of the starter assemblies 54 relative to the end 34 of the roof structure 32 is essential since these assemblies position the remaining support assemblies of each row. It will be noted thaw each of the clipping support assemblies 54C is provided with one fixed clip means 58 of the type which will hereinafter be described. A second column 60 of panel support assemblies 62 is installed next. Initially fixed and clipping support assemblies 6Z , 62C are telescopingly engaged with the fixed and clipping starter assemblies 54F, 54C. FIGURE 3 illustrates the telescoping connection between the adjacent support assemblies 54F, 62F. Moduling means 64 is provided for setting the required modular width during installation of each of the support assemblies As will hereinafter be described, the moduling means 64 provides a module adjustment, for example, of 1 8 3.175 mm in 1 16 1.588 mm increments.Each of the support assemblies presents a reference point, such as a registration aperture 66 in the exposed portion of the support assembly for use in conjunction with the string 56 to align the support assemblies. Reverting to FIGURE 2, the fixed and clipping support assembly 62F, 62c are locked into the 36 module position and are temporarily clamped or permanently secured to the subjacent purlins 50. The string 56 is stretched between the registration aperture 66 FIGURE 3 of the previously installed fixed and clipping support assembly 62F, 62C. Thereafter, as shown in FIGURE 4, all of the intermediate support assemblies including the single sliding support assembly 625 and the plural clipping support assembly 62C can be quickly inserted into their respective starter assemblies 54S, 54C and aligned and locked into the best fit position utilizing the string 56 and the registration apertures 66.Any slight errors in alignment of the starter assemblies 54 can be corrected using moduling means 64, as will be described.The intermediate support assemblies 62S, 62C are either temporarily clamped or permanently secured to the subjacent purlins 50 As can be seen in FIGURE 4, the arrangement provides a first end row 68 of clipping assemblies extending along the purlin 5Q at the roof side or eave 40 a second end row of fixing assemblies extending along the purlin 50 at the opposite roof side or ridge 38 and a plurality of intermediate rows including intermediate rows 72 consisting of plural clipping assemblies aligned along the subjacent purlins, and a selected intermediate row 72 consisting of sliding assemblies extending along and secured to the subjacent purlin. The overall arrangement provides an array of rows 68, 70, 72 and 72 , and columns 53, 60...n of panel support assemblies 54, 62.. .m.It will be noted that vach of the clipping assemblies 62C present a single fixed clipped means 58 and plural movable clip means 74 which are uniformly spaced along the support ass . Through the use of the sling means 64 FIGURE 3 the support assemblies of each row are locked into the predetermined position such that the distance between the fixed clip means 58 of adjacent support assemblies is set at a modular spacing M. The required modular spacingM is prede termined by field measurement of the steel framing as explained in Examples I through III. Referring to FIGURE 5, a first panel member 46 1 of the first course 42 is carefully positioned over the subjacent clip means and snapped thereover with firm hand or foot pressure applied at each clip means location. The first panel member 46 1 extends from the first end row 68 to and beyond the selected intermediate row 72 . A first panel member 47 1 of the second course 44 is positioned over the subjacent clip means and is snapped over the clip means with firm hand or foot pressure applied at each clip means location.The first panel member 47 1 extends from the second end row 70 to and beyond the selected intermediate row 72 of support assemblies The first panel members 46 1, 47 1 present underlapping and overlapping ends 76, 78, respectively, which form the lap joint 48. While not specifically illustrated, beads of a suitable sealant material are applied to the underlapping end 76. When the first panel member 47 1 is installed the overlapping end 78 thereof engages the sealant beads and forms a rather tight seal First fastening means, such as positive fasteners 80 fixedly secure the end of the first panel 47 1 to the subjacent support assemblies of the second end row 70. Second fastening means, such as positive fasteners 82 fixedly secure the overlapped ends 76, 78 to the subjacent support assemblies of the selected intermediate rows 72 .Concealed fastening means comprising the fixed and movable clip means 58, 74 FIGURE 4 slideably connect the panel members 46 1 and 47 1 to the subjacent support assemblies. Once the panel members 46 1 and 47 are snapped into position, they may be used as a platform, as illustrated in FIGURE 7, to secure each support assembly 62 to the purlins 50. The erection sequence described in connection withFIGURE 2 through 5, is repeated. That is, as illustrated inFIGURE 5, thermal insulation 52 is applied across the purlins 50 and retained in place by suitable clamping means 84 and tensioning means 86. A third row 88 FIGURE 6 of support assemblies 62 identical to the second row 60 FIGURE 4 is installed as described above. Second panel members 46 2 and 47 2.of the first and second rows 42, 44 are sequentially installed. as described above. The process is repeated until all of the support assemblies 62 and the panel members 46, 47 have been installed to complete the roof structure 32. While the. moduling means 64 FIGURE 3 provides a means for locking each of the support assemblies in the required modular spacinp M FIGURE 4 every second or third row of support assemblies and panels should be checked for alignment and coverage to insure that the desired modular spacing M is being maintained. It is to be understood that FIGURES 1 to 6 illustrate but qne of a variety of roof structures. Thus in each type of roof structure according to this invention, the rows 70, 72 of fixing and sliding assemblies will be located according to the requirements of the roof configuration, so as to accommodate properly thermal movement of the panel members. In some structures more than one row 70 and or row 72 may be needed. The row 72 of sliding assemblies may, in some structures, be used at the ends of the panel members at locations, such as the eave or ridge where exposed fasteners secure extrinsic structures, such as gutters and ridge ca S, for example.Where side by side runs of end overlapped pansy members are erected, the row 70 of fixing assemblies preferably is positioned near the center of the runs so that each half of the runs accommodates substantially one half of the thermal movement. In general, the present invention provides a novel arrangement for accommodating thermal movement of the panel members. For example, FIGURE 27 illustrates a fragment of a roof structure 222 wherein the rows of support assemblies are represented schematically by dash dot lines. The roof structure 222 includes a first row 224 of the sliding assemblies mounts along 2 first purlin 50 1 a second row 226 of the fixing assemblies mounted along a second purlin 50 2 which i space apart from the first purlin 50 1 and intermediate rows 228 of the clipping assemblies mounted along the intermediate purlins 50. A structure 234, such as a gutter or ridge cap, is connected to the sliding assemblies of the first row 224. Plural, edge overlapped panel members 46 extend across the rows 224, 226 and 228. First and second fastening means, such as exposed fasteners 230, 232, fixedly secure the panel members 46 to the sliding and fixing assemblies of the first and second rows 224, 226. Concealed fastening means not visible , such as the fixed and movable clip means 58, 74 FIGURE slideably connect the panel members 46 to the adjacent support assemblies. The arrangement is such that while the panel members 46 are fixedly secured to the fixing assemblies of the second row 226, the panel members 46 are free to undergo thermal movement as represented by the double arrow 236 relative to the second row 226. It will be observed in FIGURE 27 that the panel members 46 are shown extending from the first row 224 to and beyond the second row 226. This showing is intended to indicate that the panel members 46 may extend across another set of the intermediate rows to a second row of the sliding subgirts. FIGURE 8 illustrates, in end elevation, the panel member 4O 4 7 which presents upstanding intermediate ribs 90, male and female partial ribs 92, 94 along opposite longitudinal edges of the panel 46 47 , and panel webs 96 connecting adjacent ones of the ribs 90, 92, 94. Each of the partial ribs 92, 94 is overlappable and interfittable with a complementary partial rib 94, 92 of adjacent ones of the pane members 46 47 to provide a joint rib having a cross sectional configuration duplicating that of the inter mediate Ebs 90. Each of the intermediate ribs 90 includes spaced apart inturned base portions 102 connecting the rib 90 to adjacent ones of the panel webs 96.Each of the male and female partial ribs 92, 94 is connected to the adjacent panel web 96 by an inturned base portion 102. For a more detailed description of how the fixed and movable clip means 58, 74 interengage the ribs of the panel members 46 47 , reference is made to the aforesaid copending application serial numbers 249,062 and 376,169. Each of the support assemblies includes, in part, a subgirt 114, such as illustrated in FIGURE 9. The subgirt 114 includes an upper wall 116, depending sidewalls 118, and outwardly extending flanges 120. The subgirt 114 presents a rst end 122 and opposite thereto a counters J c second end 124 adapted for telescoping engagement with the first end of an adjacent subgirt. The lower face of the second end 124 preferably is beveled as at 125. The presence of the bevel 125 allows the subgirt 114 to be elevated at its first end 122 and introduced into the first end of the adjacent subgirt without being dragged across the insulation. The aforesaid moduling means 64 comprises cooperating aperture sets including a first set 126 of apertures in the upper wall 116 at the first end 122 and a second set 128 of apertures in the upper wall 116 at the countersunk second end 124. Locking means, such as a roofing nail 130 is provided for locking the first and second ends 122, 124 of adjacent subgirts in adjusted relationship. Referring to FIGURE 10, the first and second aperture sets 126, 128 include reference apertures 132, 134, respectively, aligned along a longitudinal centerline 136 of the upper wall 116 The reference apertures 132, 134 are spaced apart at the selected modular width M. The first aperture set 126 includes additional apertures 138 which, together with the reference aperture 132, are uniformly spaced apart at a first distance 140 measured in a direction parallel with the longitudinal centerline 136. The apertures 132, 138 are aligned along an axis 142 which intersects the centerline 136 at a first acute angle 144. The second aperture set 128 includes additional apertures 146 which together with the reference aperture 134, are uniformly spaced apart at a second distance 148 measured in a direction parallel with the longitudinal centerline 136 and which is different from the first distance 140. The apertures 134, 146 are aligned along an axis 150 which intersects the longitudinal centerline 136 at a second acute angle 152 which is different from the first acute angle 144. As illustrated in FIGURE 11, when the second end 124B of an adjacent subgirt 114B is inserted into the first end 122A of the subgirt 114A, the reference apertures 132A, 134B are brought into coincidence. In this position the reference apertures 132A, 132B are spaced apart at the selected modular width M. It will be appreciated that to increase the modular width M by an incremental distance, the second end 124B may be retracted from the first end 122A to bring the apertures 138A and 146B into coincidence. To decrease the modular width M, the second end 124B may be inserted further into the first end 122A to bring, for example, the apertures 138 A and 146 B into coincidence.The overall arrangement of the cooperating aperture sets is such that the apertures 132A, 138A of the first set at the first end 122A of the subgirt ll4A, with the apertures 134B, 146B of the second set at the second end 124B of the adjacent subgirt 114B during movement of the second end 124B relative to the first end 122A to bring successive pairs of corresponding apertures into coaxial alignment thereby to adjust the distance between the reference aperture 132B at the first end of the adjacent subgirt 1143 and the reference aperture 132A at the first end 122A of the subgirt 114A. It will be observed in FIGURE 11 that the registration aperture 66 is provided in the upper wall 116 intermediate of the cooperating aperture sets. For example, the registration aperture 66 may be provided in the top wall 116 of the countersunk second end 124B at a location where it will be visible even when the first and second ends 122A, 124B are fully engaged. FIGURE 12 illustrates an alternative arrangement of the cooperating aperture sets wherein the first and second aperture sets 126, 128 are aligned along a common axis which, as illustrated, comprises the longitudinal centerline 136. FIGURE 13 illustrates the engaged first and second ends 122A, 124B of adjacent support assemblies 114A, 114B. For the purposes of illustration, the apertures 138A, 146B are presented in coaxial alignment. Thus the modular width M has been increased by the increment i, such that the distance between the reference apertures 132A, 132B has now been increased to M i. The subgirt 114 of FIGURE 9 may be provided with a standoff support 154 illustrated in FIGURE 14. The standoff support 154 comprises a generally vertical web 156, an upper support flange at the upper end of the web 156, terminating in a terminal strip 162 which is bent downwardly out of the plane of the flange 158, and a base or lower support flange 160 at the lower end of the web 156. The upper flange 158 is provided with spaced apart fastener receiving openings 164 and a centrally located centering aperture 166 the function of which will hereinafter be described. The lower support flange 160 likewise is provided with spaced fastener receiving openings 168 used in securing the standoff support 154 to a purlin. FIGURE 28 illustrates a unitary support assembly 236 comprising a subgirt 238 and an integrally formed stand off support 240 consisting of a segment of the upper wall 116. The assembly 236 includes first and second ends 122, 124 adapted for telescoping engagement with the second and rst ends of adjacent ones of the assembly 238. In th embus 1ent, the first end 122 is countersunk, the second end 124 of an adjacent assembly 238 being fitted over the countersunk first end 122. The subgirt 238 being provided with the above described cooperating aperture sets 126, 128 and registration aperture 66, is erected in the same manner described above. The support assembly 236 may be used only as a fixing assembly or a clipping assembly. FIGURE 15 illustrates one of the starter support assemblies 54, and ir particular a clipping starter support assembly 54C. The assembly 54C comprises a relatively short subgirt 170 having a transverse profile identical to that of the first end 22 of the subgirt 114 FIGURE 9 . The assembly 54C additionally includes a first stand off support 154 secured to the extreme end of the subgirt 170, and a second stand of,l support 154 which is spaced from and secured to the flanges 120 by fasteners 172. The second stand off support 154 rigidifies the relatively short subgirt 170. A first aperture set 126 is provided in the upper wall 116 adjacent to the first stand off support 154.Fixed clip means 58 is secured to the upper wall 116 at the opposite end of the subgirt 170. It is to be noted that the fixing and sliding support assemblies 54F, 54S FIGURE 2 differ from the clipping support assembly 54C in that the fixed clip means 58 is not provided. The sliding support assembly 54S FIGURE 2 also differs from the clipping support assembly 54C in that connecting means to be described in connection with FIGURE 20 is employed to slideably connect the subgirt 170 to the stand off supports 1 t 154 . The movable clip means 74 FIGURES 16, 17 comprises a top clip 174 which is slideably connected to a base clip 176 for limited movement transversely of the base clip 176 in the direction of the double headed arrow 178 in Figure 17.As shown in FIGURE 17, the top clip 174 presents relatively narrow tabs 180 only one visible which are engageable with the sidewalls of the base clip 176 to limit the transverse movement of the top clip 174. The top clip 174 presents divergent clamping wings 175 having lower edges adapted to engage interior surfaces of the inturned base portions 102 FIGURE 8 presented by each rib 90 and by the ribs formed by the partial ribs 92, 94 of adjacent panel members. For a more detailed description of the movable clip means 74, reference is directed to the aforesaid copending U. S.Patent Application serial number 249,062, that pending application being incorporated herein by reference. The fixed clip means 58 FIGURE 18 is similar to the movable clip means 74 in that it includes a top clip 174 and a base clip 176. The fixed clip means 58 differs from the movable clip means 74 in that relatively wide tabs 182 only one visible are provided to maintain the top clip 174 substantially fixed with respect to the base clip 176. The top clip 174 also presents the aforesaid divergent clamping wings 175. For a more detailed description of the fixed clip means 58 and the use thereof in combination with the movable clip means 74 to produce moduling of panel members, reference is made to the aforesaid U. S. Patent Application serial number 376,169, that application being incorporated herein by reference. FIGU E 19 illustrates one of the support assemblies 62, and in p ocular the clipping support assembly 62C. The assembly 62C comprises the subgirt 114, the stand off support 154 which is secured to the first end 122 of the lbgirt 114, one fixed clip means 58 and plural, in this tance two movable clip means 74. The clipping support assembly 62C is fac r j assembled. Therefore, the fixed and movable clip means 58, 74 are precisely located on the upper wall 116 of the subgirt 114. It should be noted that the fixing and sliding support assemblies 2, 62S FIGURES 2, 4 differ from the assembly 62C in that the fixed and movable clip means 58 , 74 are net provided. It should also be noted that the sliding support assembly 62S FIGURE 4 also differs from the support assembly 62C in that connecting means to be described in connection with FIGURE 20 slideably connects the subgirt 114 to the stand oEr support 154 to allow the panel members and the subgirt 114 te move as a unit during thermal expansion and contraction of the panel members. FIGURE 20 illustrates the components of connecting means 184 for sLideably connecting the subgirt 114 to the stand off support 154e The connecting means 184 comprises a bearing plate 186 and a clamping plate 188. The bearing plate 186 includes lateral portions 190 each provided with a centrally located dimple 192. The clamping plate 188 comprises a central portion 194 and lateral portions 196 which are vertically offset from the central portion 194. Each or the lateral portions 196 is connected to the central portion 19 by a profiled portion providing a generally U shaped groove 198. Referring to FIGURE 21, it will be observed that the bearing plate 186 underlies the subgirt flanges 120 and h one of the lateral portions 190 overlying the upper support flange 158. The central portion 19A of the clamping plate 188 engages a lower surface of the bearing plate 186. One of the lateral portions 196 underlies the upper support flange 158. Fastening means, such as the fasteners 172 only one visible secure the subgirt flanges 120 to the clamping plate 188 with the bearing plate 186 clamped therebetween. It will be observed in FIGURE 21 that a space 200 is presented between each lateral portion 190 of the bearing plate 186 and the confronting lateral portion 196 of the clamping plate 188. The vertical dimension of the space 200 preferably is greater than the thickness of the upper support flange 158 of the stand off support 154 to allow relatively free movement of the subgirt 114 relative to the stand off support 154 For example, in one commercial embodiment, the rerticar dime.nsion of the space 200 is 0.094 2.388 mm whereas the thickness of the support flange 158 is 0.0635 1.163 mm . The connecting means 184 incorporates guide means 202 associated with the stand off support 154 and one of the plates 188 186 , for guiding movement of the subgirt 114 relative to the stand off support 154, induced by thermal expansion and contraction of a panel member. The guide means 202 comprises the terminal strip 162 presented by the upper support flange 158, and the generally U shaped groove 198 which receives and is guided by the terminal strip 162. The connecting means 184 also incorporates centering means 204 FIGURES 22, 23 for initially centering the connecting means 184 on the upper support flange 158 during assembly. The centering means 204 includes the centering aperture 56 and the dimple 192. FIGURE 22 illustrates the factory assembled support assembly 62 wherein the dimple 192 extends into the centering aperture 166 and retains the connecting means 184 centered with respect to the upper support f nge 158. The bearing plate 186 is manufactured from relatively thin gauge sheet metal. In a commercial embodiment, the bearing plate 186 is formed from sheet metal having a thickness of 0.056 sol.311 mm . The bearing plate 186 is therefore relatively flexible. The arrangement is such that when, as shown in FIGURE 23, a panel member not illustrated secured to the subgirt 114 undergoes thermal expansion, a force represented by the arrow 206 causes the subgirt 114 and the bearing and clamping plates 186, 188 to move relative to the fixed upper support flange 158. During this movement, the dimple 192 rides over an edge of the centering aperture 166 causing the bearing plate 186 to be deflected as illustrated in FIGURE 23.As the panel undergoes thermal contraction, the subgirt 114 and the connecting means 184 move relative to the upper support flange 158 back to or beyond the centered position illustrated in FIGURE 22 depending on the temperature differentials. FIGURE 24 illustrates an alternative stand off support 208 adapted for use with rigid insulation. The stand off support 208 includes lower and upper generally vertical web segments 210, 212 which are laterally offset and connected ov by a horizontal web segment 214. The hereinbefore described upper support ç lge 158 ad. .ns an upper end of the upper web segment 212. The lower web segment 210 presents a lower edge 216 adapted to penetrate the rigid insulation. As illustrated in FIGURE 25, rigid insulation 218, such as a board of rigid foamed plastics, overlies the purlin 50. The stand off support 208 is secured to the subgirt 114 in the manner described above. During installation, the lower edge 216 is pressed through the rigid insulation 218 until it comes to rest on the purlin 50. Thereafter, a fastener 220 is inserted through the horizontal web segment 214 through the rigid insulation 118 and is threadedly engaged in the purlin 50.
