# Measurement of oscillatory and vibrational motion.

## Abstract
A device for monitoring torsional vibrations in a rotary shaft 10 comprises a laser source 14 , a 50 transmission reflec tion beamsplitter 18 and a mirror 20 arranged to provide two spaced parallel laser beams 16 and 17 which strike the surface of the shaft 10 at points A and B respectively. Since the shaft surface is moving, light backscattered at the surface is Doppler shifted and since the velocity of the surface at points A and B differs, the frequency of light backscattered at the two points is shifted by different amounts. Light backscattered along the axes of the incident beams 16 and 17 is mixed and directed into a detector 22 where it heterodynes. The frequency at which the elected light intensity is modulated is directly proportional to the speed of rotation of the shaft 10 . The device, and the method it embodies, can be used to measure the difference in velocity at two points on any surface undergoing non uniform motion and can, therefore, be used generally to characterise vibrational motion.
