## Description
MEDICAMENT INHALATION DEVICE BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART Hypersensitive individuals undergo an altered state as a result of contact with the antigens from an allergen, leading to the formation of antibodies to the allergen. Subsequent contact with one of those antigens or a structurally similar substance can evoke in an allergic individual a pathological reaction, due to the presence of such antibodies. A prominent manifestation includes bronchial asthma, characterized by obstruction of the lung airway passages. In order to reduce these undesirable allergic responses, various medicaments which have an antiallergic characteristic have been administered to patients. It has been firmly established that the optimal route of medicament administration to provide thera peutic relief against such allergic response is by inhalation, which provides local administration to the lung airway lumen. Inhalation provides convenience and spesd of action and often requires only a small dose of the pharmacologially active agent. One type of inhalation device involves the use of conventional pressurized aerosol canisters. Some patients, however, find it difficult to synchronize inhalation through the mouth with activation of the canister. Substances used as propellants in such aerosols may include fluorocarbons, which are safe when inhaled in small quantities, but may predispose individuals to ventricular arrhythmias if inhaler usage is excessive. Various inhalation devices have been proposed and used which are capable of delivering into the patients lungs medicaments which are dry powders. Typical of such inhalation devices are those described in U.S.Patent Nos. 3,507,277 3,635,219, 3,669,113 and 3,870,046. Inhalation devices of this type generally rely upon the motion of inhaled air to cause dispersion of the medicament into the air being inhaled. Many of the prior art devices are susceptible to clogging and are difficult to operate. Drug delivery by inhalation requires a device which is easy to use by young and older individuals, compact in size, and capable of delivering a metered dose of various sized particles.There is a need in the allergy field for such a simplified and efficient inhalation device. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is a inhalation device comprising a medicament chamber capable of storing finelydivided medicament, an air inhalation chamber and a metered dose medicament delivery member, said medicament chamber having a downwardly directed funnel shaped bottom wall having a bottom opening and a removable top closure member, said air inhalation chamber having a a top opening, side air inlet means and a mouthpiece air outlet means located opposite to said air inlet means, said medicament delivery member having a cavity of pre determined volume, said cavity opening being alignable to sequentially communicate both with said bottom opening of said medicament chamber and said top opening of said air inhalation chamber, whereby when said cavity opening of said medicament delivery member is aligned with said bottom opening of said medicament chamber, finely divided medicament in said medicament chamber can pass into and fill said cavity to provide a predetermined dose of said medicament, and when said cavity opening is aligned with the top opening of said air inhalation chamber, the predetermined dose of said medicament is metered into said air inhalation chamber, and subsequent inhalation of air from said air inlet means to said mouthpiece outlet means effects movement of said medicament through said inhalation chamber and out said mouthpiece for passage into the respiratory tract. DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figure 1 is a front elevational view of one embodiment of a medicament inhalation device of the present invention Figure 2 is a vertical right side cross sectional view of the medicament inhalation device taken along line 2 2 of Figure 1 Figure 3 is a rear elevational view of the medica ment inhalation device taken along line 3 3 of Figure 2 showing one embodiment of the air inlet system Figure 4 is the same view as in Figure 3 showing a modified embodiment of the air inlet system Figure 5 is a vertical rear cross sectional view of the medicament inhalation device taken along line 5 5 of Figure 2 DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Referring to FIGS. 1 5, the illustrated embodiment of the present invention comprises a medicament inhalation device 10 having a medicament chamber 11, an air inhalation chamber 12, and a metered dose medicament delivery member 13. Medicament chamber 11 is generally vertically cylindrical in shape and is formed with sidewalls 16 and bottom wall surface 27 having a downwardly directed funnel shaped bottom wall portion 14 formed therein having a bottom opening 15 which communicates with a vertical passage 29.Medicament chamber 11 also has a transverse horizontal cylindrical passage 28 formed therein communicating with passage 29 and bottom opening 15. Sidewalls 16 terminate in an upper edge surface 17 which has a removable closure member 18 associated therewith. Air inhalation chamber 12 is generally horizontally cylindrical in shape and has sidewalls 30 with a top opening 19 formed therein communicating with passage 29. One end 20 of chamber 12 is closed with an air inlet means comprising an inlet element 31 having a plurality of inlet openings 32 therein and a flexible diaphragm 33 behind element 31, having central slits 34 therein FIGS. 2 and 3 . The other end 21 of chamber 12 forms a mouthpiece air outlet means. End 21 has a peripheral rim 35 and a gauze 22 extending across the opening thereof FIG. 5 . End 21 can also have a removable protective cap 23 positioned thereon.FIG. 5 shows that chamber 12 also has a medicament collector 36 located beneath opening 19. The metered dose medicament delivery member 13 comprises a cylindrical solid shaft 37 rotatably positioned within passage 28. Member 13 has a cavity 24 formed therein having a cross sectional diameter the same as that of passage 29 and having a predetermined volume. Member 13 has a knurled knob 38 attached thereto and which extends exterior to chamber 11. FIG. 3 shows the slits 34 of diaphragm 33 which are located perpendicular to each other. FIG. 4 shows a further embodiment wherein end 20 is sealed with member 31 having a single central inlet opening 32. In order to utilize the device of this invention, closure member 18 is removed from medicament chamber 11 and a desired amount of finely divided medicament, for example, 40 to 50 mg of a powder containing an active anti allergic component in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, is placed in the medicament chamber 11. The finely divided medicament can range from about 0.5 to 5 microns in particle size as a preferred range for efficient administration to the lung airway lumen. The cavity opening 24 of metered dose medicament delivery member 13 is then aligned with bottom opening 15 of medicament chamber 11 to allow a pre determined dose of medicament powder to pass into cavity opening 24. Rotation of member 13 to the position shown in FIG. 2 produces sequential alignment of cavity opening 24 with top opening 19 of air inhalation chamber 12. This meters the predetermined dose of medicament powder contained in cavity opening 24 into air inhalation chamber 12.Mouthpiece protective cap 23 is removed from mouthpiece air outlet means 21, and subsequent inhalation of air from air inlet means 20 effects movement of the medicament through the air inhalation chamber 12 and out mouthpiece air outlet means 21 for passage into the respiratory tract. Medicament chamber 11 air inhalation chamber 12 and delivery member 13 are preferably formed from suitable rigid organoplastic materials, such as poly ethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, styrene acrylonitrile copolymers, polycarbonate, acetal copolymers, nitrile acrylonitrile styrene copolymers, polymethyl pentene, polyacrylate and polymethacrylate and the like. For ease of visual viewing of the amount of medicament passing through device 10, chambers 11 and 12 are desirably optically transparent. Gauze 22 is preferably of fine stainless steel, having a mesh opening slightly larger than the largest particle size medicament to be administered to prevent any undesirably large particle size medicament from being inhaled into the respiratory tract.
