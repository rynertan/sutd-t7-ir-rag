# LIGHTING APPARATUS.

## Abstract
A lighting apparatus has a reflecting mirror R positioned at the rear of a light source L. The three dimensional shape of the reflecting mirror R is designed by a computer such that the reflecting mirror R reflects light in a special mode. By virtue of the special three dimensional shape of the reflect ing mirror, an infinite number of light rays from the light source L are reflected by the reflecting mirror in such a manner that the light rays reflected at particular portions of the reflecting mirror intersect the light rays reflected at other innumerable different portions of the reflecting mirror at innumerable different points. The reflecting mirror is further designed in such a three dimensional shape that the light reflected by the reflecting mirror is given a predetermined luminous flux distribution. Designing of such special paths of reflected light rays makes it possible to obtain various uses of the lighting apparatus.
