# Transportation system.

## Abstract
A transportation system, particularly for handling con tainers for transport by rail vehicles, lorries or ships, includes an elevated guideway comprising a plurality of spaced parallel longitudinal tracks 13, 14, 15 connected by trans verse tracks 16 which are movable along the longitudinal tracks. Vehicles 20 travel along the tracks and are equipped with hoists for lifting containers beneath the guideway into the vehicles. Each vehicle is equipped with lower wheels 28 which run on rails 29 on the longitudinal tracks 13, 14, 15, and upper wheels 38 which run on high level guides 40 on the transverse tracks 16. When it is wished to transfer the vehicle from one track to another at a junction this may be effected by stopping the vehicle at the junction, engaging the appropriate wheels with the guides or rails, as the case may be, on the other track and then continuing movement along that other track. By suitable location of the transverse tracks 16 and movement of the vehicles 20, containers can be picked up or deposited at any position within the total area covered by the guideway. There may be mounted at one side of the guideway a movable gantry 17 on to which vehicles may be transferred from the guideway for transporting containers into and out of ships.
