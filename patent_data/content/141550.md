# Heat storage composition.

## Abstract
A heat storage composition comprises sodium sulfate decahydrate as main component, a supercooling inhibitor, and as a solid liquid separation inhibitor, hydraulic calcium sulfate and or calcium sulfate dihydrate in an amount of 2 15 by weight based on the whole weight of the composi tion, whereby the solid liquid separation, i.e. the sedimenta tion of the anhydrous sodium sulfate during the phase transition, is effectively prevented and the long term stability is improved. The long term stability of the composition can be more improved by addition of a silica series of thickener.
