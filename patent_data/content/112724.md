# Process for sulphonating polysulphones.

## Abstract
A process for the sulphonation of a polysulphone having recurring units of the formula Ph SOâ‚‚ Ph O III wherein Ph is 1,4 phenylene, comprises suspending the poly sulphone, in the form of a polymer solvent intercrystalline solid, in a fluid, chlorinated hydrocarbon and reacting the suspended polysulphone with a sulphonating agent at from 50 to 80 C in which the amount of the sulphonating agent is such that there are from 0.4 to 5 atoms of sulphur in the sulphonating agent per atom of sulphur in the sulphonated product.
