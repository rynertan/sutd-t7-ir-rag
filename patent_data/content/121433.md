# Interconnectible polygonal construction modules.

## Abstract
The invention relates to polygonal construction modules capable of being connected together by their edges and by their faces to create many different three dimensional shapes. Each module comprises a body portion 11 having edge faces, a top face and a bottom face, each said edge face having a plurality of outwardly projecting integrally formed fingers 12 of square or rectangular cross section and spaces there between. The fingers and spaces are positioned along each edge face such that the alignment of fingers and spaces along the edge face of any polygon inversely mates with corres ponding fingers and spaces of an edge face of another polygon, a side edge of at least one of the fingers having a convex projection 14 and at least one of the fingers having a corresponding depression 13 . The projections and depres sions are arranged to provide a snap together lateral interlock between adjacent modules while permitting hinging action between modules on an axis parallel to a side face. Face connection means, preferably in the form of an annular array of radial fins, or a set of pins 15 and mating rings 16 extends upwardly from the top face of the module to provide face to face joining between modules.
