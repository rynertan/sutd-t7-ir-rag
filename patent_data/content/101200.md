# TRANSFER FACTOR FOR USE IN TREATING VIRAL INFECTIONS

## Abstract
Transfer factor specific to a given virus is prepared by immunising a mammal with respect to the virus and obtaining the transfer factor thus produced specific to the virus from the immunised mammal, for example in the form of a dialysate of cells of lymphoid origin or of liver cells taken from the immunised mammal. The transfer factor can then be used to combat a viral infection by administering to a patient transfer factor specific to the virus to which the infection is attributable.
