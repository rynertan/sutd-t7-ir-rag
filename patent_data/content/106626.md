# Combined plates and glass holders.

## Abstract
A combined plate and glass holder comprises integrally formed support means 10 presenting a peripheral margin 28 enclosing a first area 12 for use as a plate, and a second area 16 for use as a glass holder, the first and second areas being distinguished by location defining means 18 which is at least partly in the form of structure extending upwardly from at least part of the periphery of the second area 16 to provide lateral support, characterised in that the second area 16 is located adjacent to an edge 24 defining part of a single hole 20 through the support means 10 with an opposed edge 26 of the hole 20 being located adjacent to the margin 28 whereby, in use, a thumb of a hand extends over said edge 24 of the hole 20 to press against a glass placed on the second area 16 , with the back of the thumb pressing against said opposed edge 26 of the hole 20 to provide stability and all the fingers of the hand pressing against the first area 12 from underneath to provide further stability.
