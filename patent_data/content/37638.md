# Cooking apparatus.

## Abstract
An electric cooker or cooking hob has a ceramic plate 2 on which there are a number of hot plate areas each heated by a respective annular heating element 4 disposed within an insulating housing 7 . A temperature dependent resistor 9 is disposed below the hot plate area at the centre of focus of a reflector 8 which is arranged to focus radiant energy from the hot plate area onto the resistor 9 while at the same time shielding the resistor 9 from direct radiation from the electric heating element 4 . The signal derived from the resistor 9 is a measure of the temperature of the hot plate and can be used to provide a thermal tripping function to prevent over heating of the hot plate area and or to carry out closed loop control of the temperature of the hot plate area. The reflector 8 may be replaced by a shield which shields the resistor 9 from direct heating by the heater. A further annular heating element surrounding the ment 4 may be provided, with the control circuitry enabling either the element 4 alone or element 4 plus the outer element to be energised.
