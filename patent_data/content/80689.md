# Method for fabricating multilayer laminated printed circuit boards.

## Abstract
A laminate for a laminated multilayer circuit board incorporates as a constituent member the plating layer 11 from a peel apart temporary base 12 used in the fabrication of the laminate. The layer 11 , with its one surface 11a superimposed on the base 12 , has additively plated to its opposite surface 11b individual conductors 14 and is subsequently personalized in register with the pattern of the plated conductor circuitry. The personalized layer 11 and the plated conductors 14 are embedded in a dielectric layer 15 , the superimposed surface 11a being flush mounted in the dielectric layer 15 . The base 12 has a rough like surface profile characteristic that imparts at least a conformal surface profile characteristic in the superimposed surface 11a of the plating layer 11 which in turn provides improved adherence of this superimposed flush mounted surface, when subsequently exposed by the removal of the peel apart base 12 , to another dielectric layer 17 thereafter laminated to the embedding dielectric layer 15 to inhibit delamination between the two dielectric layers. Preferably, the base 12 also imparts a conformal profile surface characteristic either to the plating surface 11b to improve the plating bond between the plating layer 11 and conduc tors 14 , and or to the laminating surface 15a of the embedding dielectric layer 15 to improve the lamination bond between the two dielectric layers 15, 17 , which combine with the conformal characteristic of the plating layer s 11 flush mounted surface 11a to inhibit synergistic ally delamination between the two dielectric layers.
