# Electronic device and its manufacturing method.

## Abstract
An electronic device having a substrate 2 with an insulating surface a layer member 3 is formed on the substrate 2 having a patterned conductive or semiconduc tive layer. The layer member 3 is surrounded by an insulating layer 41 formed on substrate 2 and in contact with the side faces of the layer member 3 but not extending onto the top surface of the layer member 3 .
