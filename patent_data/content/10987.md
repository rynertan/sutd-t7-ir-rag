# Device for oral administration to a ruminant animal.

## Abstract
A device for oral administration to a ruminant animal includes a veterinary medicament, such as an anthelmintic, uniformly dispersed throughout an erodable sheet 1 com prising an ethylene vinylacetate copolymer. The sheet 1 is rolled up and stuck together with adhesive backed paper strips 3 for administration, and unrolls in the rumen to take up a planar configuration which is retained in the rumen. The sheet may be placed within a plastics netting envelope 11 to give more controlled erosion and release of medica ment.
