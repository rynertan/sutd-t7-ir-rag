# CLEARANCE TYPE LIQUID LUBRICANT SEAL ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
The invention deals with a clearance type liquid lubri cant seal assembly for use in rotary fluid handling machin ery. For preventing lubricant from leaking into working fluid by flowing by capillary action along a fixed surface, a coating 19 which is not wetted by the lubricant is placed on the fixed surface of the machinery such that any lubricant which may flow onto the coating is caused to bead up and is thus easily swept away by flow of seal gas.
