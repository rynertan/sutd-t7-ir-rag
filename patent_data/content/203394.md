The electronic music voice ringer ciruit according to the present invention can be incorporated into telephone subscriber sets of any type and driven by low frequency ringing pulses from a conventional switch board to generate an intermittent flashing signals and an incessant audible music voice calling signals. It generates flashing signals first in response to incoming ringing pulses, and then generates audible music voice calling signals if the flashing signals do not arouse subscriber s attention. The electronic music voice ringer circuit according to the present invention can generate a sweet melodic, trilling music calling signals or voice calling signals simulating speech sounds, which are not piercing and noisy, and audible in a larger range. The electronic music voice ringer circuit according to the present invention can maitain a non trilling music calling signal different from the trilling signal for 5 15 seconds affter the ringing pulses end so as to tell the telephone subscriber that there was a incoming call just a moment ago.

Brief Description of Drawings Fig.1 is a block diagram of the electronic music voice ringer circuit according to the present invention Fig.2 shows an arrangement of the electronic music voice ringer circuit according to the present invention Fig.3 shows circuit arrangement of IC1. Description of Preferred Embodiment The electronic music ringer circuit according to present invention comprises a single transistor and an integrated music signal generator and a plurality of diodes, resistors and capacitors wherein the above transistor, diodes and resistor may be integrated as a micro module. The circuit comprises a master trigger circuit 1 , a power supply ciruit 2 , a first trigger circuit 4 , a second trigger circuit 3 , a music signal amplifier 5 , a trilling circuit 6 , a music signal generator 8 , a tone control ciruit 7 and a music signal output circuit 9 . The power supply 2 is connected directly to ringing pulse circuit via a resistor capacitor network. Incoming ringing pulses are rectified to DC voltages and then the rectified signals are supplied to music signal amplifier 5 and music signal generator 8 affter being limited and filtered. The master trigger circuit and neon lamp 1 is triggered by a ringing pulse. As a result, a jumping trigger singal is formed While generating a jumping signal. The jumping signal starts a music program in the music signal generator 8 via the first trigger circuit 4 and sets off the operation of music signal amplifier 5 via the second trigger circuit 3 . Music signal amplifier 5 is either an audiofrequency amplifier or an electronic switch. It is in cut off state and accordingly cuts off the operating voltage of music signal generator 8 when ringing pulses are absent. The muster trigger circuit triggered by incoming ringing pulses to generate a jumping pulse which turns on music signal amplifier 5 via second trigger circuit 3 . At the same time, the music signal amplifier 5 provides operating voltage for the music signal generator 8 which is then turned on by jumping pulse via first trigger circuit 4 . The music signals from music signal generator 8 are sent out by a music signal output circuit 9 after being amplified by amplifier 5 which concurrently acts as a constant current source to stabilize the suystem. The closed loop formed by music signal amplifier 5 and music signal generator 8 continuously operates with the energy stored in capacitor c3 in the intervals of ringing pulses to generate continuous music signal. In order to improve acoustic effect a trilling circuit 6 is added to amplifier 5 to produce lowfrequency mudulated music, hence to produce special trill which makes music sound sweet and intersting. Furthermore, a tone control circuit 7 is provided according to the present invention, which can change the main oscilatring frequency of the music signal generator 8 to change the tone of music. Thus , several telephone sets in a room with different tones of music can be distinguished from one another. The off hook switch of a telephone set can cutoff the music signal generator and the amplifier. The electronic voice ringer circuit according to the present invention may employ an integrated voice synthesis circuit which can simulates speech sounds instead of music signal generator IC2 in Fig 2. Referring now to Fig.2 and 3. Ringing pulses are fed to AC terminals A and B of the diode bridge comprising diodes D1, D2, D3 and D4 via a resistor capacitor network composed of resistor R0 and capacitor C2. A Zener diodeZD1 is connected across the DC output terminals C andD of the bridge to perform voltage regulation and protection. Wherein D is a common earth potential point while c is a positive DC voltage output terminal. A capacitor C3 is connected between C and D to perform filtering and energy storing. The positive DC voltage from ferminal C is supplied to transistor T via primary winding of an output transformer Tr which is connected in series with the collector circuit of the transistorT. R11 is a discharging resistor of C3. The master trigger circuit comprises copacitor C1, diodes D5, D6 and neon lamp Ne. Capacitor C1 and diodeD5 in series are connected in parallel with ringing pulse line. One terminal of neon lamp is connected to the negtive end of diode D6 whose positive end is connectod to conjumction of C1 and D5. The other terminal of neon lamp is connected to first trigger circuit and second trigger circuit. A ringing pulse is rectified by a rectifer doubler composed of capacitor C1, diodes D5,D6. The output from negtive end of diode D6 is a positive pulse whose amplitude is twice as high as the positive amplitude of the ringing pulse. The positive pulse then turns on the negtive resistonce device Ne, which gererates flashing signals. On another terminal of Neon lamp, a positive jumping pulses is formed. The second trigger circuit consists of resistors R2, R3, capacitor C4 and diode D7. The positive jumping pulse is fed to the base of trnsistor T of music signal amplifier 5 from the conjunction of resistors R1 and R2 through resistorR2, diode D7 and resistor R3. The amplifier composed of transistor T is a class C amplifier which is usually in cut off state. When positive jumping pulse provides positive bias for the base of transistor T, the transistor turns on, providing power supply for music signal generator 8 . Resistor R2 and capacitor C4 consititute a decoupling circuit to suppress the noises of amplifier due to the noises in the ringing pulses. Zener diodeZD2, resistors R1, Rq and capacitor C8 constitute first trigger 4 .The positive jumping pulse directly initiates music signal generator 8 to start music program after being divided by resistor R1 and R4. Zener diode ZD2 is provided to limit the amplitude of trigger pulse. Resistor R1 and capacitor C8 is an integrating circuit which performs antijamming. The time lag between the generation of flashing signals and that of music signals upon the comming of ringing pulses can be changed by adjusting resistance of resistor R1 or capacitance of capacitor C8. The music program is started by music signal generator 8 , from which the output music signals are coupled to the base of transistor T, and supplied from collector to transformer Tr after being amplified. The transformer Tr is provided to match for impedncematching and transfering power, its secondary winding drives speaker to sound music call. In the intervals of ringing pulses, the energy stored in filterring capacitor C3 of power supply circuit 2 is supplied via transformer Tr and transistor T to IC2 of music signal gencerator 8 the supply voltage toIC2 is clamped to a propriate and stoble voltage by Zener diode ZD3. The output of IC2 is coupled to the base of transistor T via capacitor C7 to contiuously turn on T. A capacitor C6 is connected across the emitter of transistor T and the common earth, the emither of transistor T becoming a.c common earth, and transitorT operating in commen emitter state. The music signals are sent into spea ker sp via transformer Tr to soccunal music signals continaousely. Resistor Rlo connected to primary winding of transformer Tr can be controlled by a switch kl. When k1 is open, it does not function. When k1 is closed, it connects in parallel with primary winding of transformer Tr and shunts a part of music signals from collector of transistor T to supply terminal thereby to reduce output volume. 6 Tone control circuit consists of resistors R6, R7,R8 and switch k2. The main oscilating frequency of music 2 signal generator can be charged by means of k2, hence, the beat and tone of the music can be changed. Rosistor R9 and capacitor C5 in parallel are connected to the emitter of transistor T which produce a low frequency modulated oscilation together with transistor T and capacitor C6 to present trilling effect and make the music more sweet and pleasant. The frequency and amplitude of trilling modulation can be changed by adjusting the resistance of resistor Rg. When the telephone reciever of the subscriber set is taken up for calling, the off hook saith T1 connected between supply terminal of music signal generator 8 and the common terminal is closed to short circuit supply terminal and stop music program. Switch j2 is connected 2 with one end to positive supply terminal of the ICl and with the other end to the tramsformer Tr. When the telephone set is off hook, switch J2 is open, and switchJ1 is closed, the music is stopped. Besides, when the telephone set is off hook, J2 is open, so that the voice signals will not be shunted by capacitor C3. The electronic voice ringer circuit according to the present invention has approximately the same structure as music ringer circuit exept that the above music generator IC2 is replaced by an intergrated voice syunthesis circuit IC2 with the above trilling circuit omitted.
