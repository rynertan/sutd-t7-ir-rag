## Description
CONTROL OF THIOSULFATE IN WETDESULFURIZATION PROCESS SOLUTIONS This invention relates to the treatment of H2S containing gas streams to recover sulfur and, more particularly, to an improved wet desulfurization method employing a regenerable oxidizing agent and providing for control of thiosulfate byproduct formation in the recycled process solution. Hydrogen sulfide H2S is present as a contaminant in many gas streams such as natural gas, coal coke oven gas, Claus process tail gas and the like. These gas streams are commonly treated by wet desulfurization processes which utilize an aqueous absorption medium to absorb hydrogen sulfide and yield a substantially H2S free gas stream.Such processes are usually operated in a cyclical manner and employ a regenerable oxidizing agent to oxidize the absorbed H2S to elemental sulfur, which is recovered.Regeneration of the reduced oxidizing agent in the aqueous absorption medium, after its oxidation of the H2S to sulfur, is typically accomplished by contacting the aqueous medium with air or oxygen gas. One wet desulfurization process which has gained acceptance throughout the United States, especially in the treatment of Claus process tail gas streams, is theStretford process. The Stretford process involves absorption of H2S into an aqueous alkaline solution which contains sodium vanadate and the sodium salt of anthraquinone disulfonic acid ADA . The absorbed H2S forms sodium hydrosulfide NaHS in the solution, which is oxidized to elemental sulfur by the sodium vanadate present in the absorption liquor. After recovery of the solid sulfur, the absorption liquor, containing reduced vanadate and the ADA salt, is contacted with air to regenerate the oxidizing agent. The regenerated solution is then recycled for reuse. A more detailed description of the Stretford process is provided by F. C. Riesenfeld and A. L. Kohl in Gas Purification 2nd ed., Gulf Publishing Company, Boston, 1974 , at pp. 432 441. A wet desulfurization process which employs quinone derivatives as the regenerable oxidizing agent is taught in U. S. Patent No. 3,459,495. This wet desulfurization process is in commercial use, being known as the Takahax process, and employs sodium 1,4 naphthoquinone 2 sulfonate as the preferred quinone derivative. A similar process is disclosed in U. S. Patent No. 3,937,795 which utilizes a naphthoquinone chelate compound as the regenerable oxidizing agent. These and other similar wet desulfurization processes utilize a regenerable oxidizing agent that may be either an organic e.g., anthraquinone or naphthoquinone or inorganic e.g., arsenate, ferric oxide compound and which is employed in a multiple coupled redox reaction that occurs in the aqueous absorption medium. The regenerable oxidizing agent is principally noteworthy for its ease in oxidizing the absorbed sulfide species and of being reoxidized from a reduced state in the cyclical wet desulfurization process. A common drawback associated with many wet desulfurization processes, particularly those involving quinone derivatives, is the formation of thiosulfate 8203 as oxidation reaction. Thiosulfate formation in cyclic wet desulfurization processes, if ignored, will eventually cause the thiosulfate level in the recycled aqueous absorption medium to reach a, saturation concentration, and thiosulfate salts will then precipitate in the system. The most common technique for controlling thiosulfate levels in wet desulfurization systems is to remove a portion of the recirculated aqueous absorption medium as a purge stream which is then discarded. Alternatively, the recirculated aqueous absorption medium may be allowed to accumulate thiosulfate to a level approaching saturation concentration, at which point all of the solution is dumped. Aqueous absorption medium that is discarded as a purge stream or dumped must be replaced with make up solution, which must necessarily contain regenerable oxidizing agent and other valuable chemicals to replace that lost in the discarded medium. Other methods have been proposed for. controlling thiosulfate concentration in wet desulfurization system process liquors, but these involve costly and or complex procedures, none of which are known to be in commercial use. United States Patent No. 3,642,448 teaches that thiosulfate formation in wet desulfurization systems can be minimized by removal of dissolved oxygen from the recirculated absorption solution prior to contacting the absorption medium with the H2S containing gas stream. This method, however, provides no means for coping with thiosulfate which does, in fact, form in the recirculated aqueous absorption solution. United States Patent No. 3,928,535 discloses a method for precipitating thiosulfate and or sulfate salts from quinone containing process solutions, by the addition of methanol as a salting out agent. United States Patent No. 3,959,452 teaches a complex multi step method for recovering vanadate and anthraquinone salts from a thiosulfate containing Stretford process purge stream, by treating the purge stream with B3PO4 or H2SO4 and then with lime. United States Patent No. 3,972,989 acknowledges the necessity for a purge stream to maintain thiosulfate concentrations in Stretford type process solutions below saturation concentration but indicates that the presence of small amounts. of thiosulfate are beneficial for minimizing destruction of anthraquinone disulfonic acid salts which are also present in such solutions. Japanese Patent Publication No. 1978 108068 discloses a method for treating a Takahax process purge stream, containing precipitated solids, to reduce its chemical oxygen demand COD , through the addition of hydrogen peroxide and a catalyst. However, valuable components in the discarded purge stream of this method are not recovered for reuse. The present invention provides a means for controlling the thiosulfate concentration in alkaline absorption media which contain regenerable oxidizing agents, without resort to purge streams or complex precipitation techniques for the removal of thiosulfate salts. Losses of valuable oxidizing agent and other chemicals in the recirculated alkaline absorption media are minimized, since this novel method obviates the need for a purge stream to remove thiosulfate. In accordance with the present invention, the concentration of dissolved thiosulfate byproduct in the recirculated aqueous alkaline absorption medium of a cyclic wet desulfurization process is controlled by introducing a peroxide chemical into the thiosulfate containing absorption medium in an amount sufficient to maintain the thiosulfate below its saturation concentration. Aqueous hydrogen peroxide, containing 30 50 by weight H202, is the preferred peroxide chemical. The method of this invention is applicable to cyclic wet desulfurization processes for recovering sulfur from H25 containing gas streams, which processes are faced with the problem of thiosulfate byproduct forming in the aqueous absorption medium. Such processes ordinarily involve the conventional steps of i contacting an H2S containing gas stream with an aqueous alkaline absorption medium, contain ing a regenerable oxidizing agent ii absorbing H2S into the absorption medium and converting it to a hydrosulfide iii oxidizing the hydrosulfide with the regener able oxidizing agent to form elemental sulfur, which is subsequently recovered from the ab sorption medium iv regenerating the absorption medium by contact ing the reduced oxidizing agent with an oxy gen containing gas and v recirculating the regenerated absorption me dium to repeat the desulfurization cycle.The method of this invention is preferably employed with conventional wet desulfurization processes which utilize anthraquinone vanadate or naphthaquinone regenerable oxidizing agents. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, aqueous hydrogen peroxide is introduced into the aqueous absorption medium after its regeneration and prior to its being contacted further with an H2S containing gas stream. The amount of hydrogen peroxide introduced into the thiosulfate containing aqueous absorption medium is desirably less than the stoichiometric quantity required to oxidize all of the thiosulfate in the absorption medium to sulfate, and is preferably 2 3 moles H202 per mole thiosulfate. The thiosulfate concentration in the recirculated aqueous absorption medium is desirably maintained below about 20 by weight, expressed as Na2S2O3, and preferably is maintained between about 5 to 15 by weight. The drawing is a schematic flow diagram illustrating a preferred embodiment of the invention as applied to theStretford wet desulfurization process for treating H2Scontaining gas streams. The process of the invention is applicable to cyclic wet desulfurization systems that employ an aqueous alkaline absorption medium containing a regenerable oxidizing agent and in which thiosulfate salt buildup in the absorption medium is a problem. Thiosulfate formation in wet desulfurization systems occurs primarily when dissolved HS in the aqueous absorption medium, in the form of hydrosulfide, is oxidized from a 2 valence state to a 2 valence state 2HS O2 S2O3 H2O Thiosulfate may also be formed by the reaction between elemental sulfur in the process solution and alkali metal or ammonium carbonate present in the alkaline absorption medium. Thiosulfate which is formed in wet desulfurization systems is ordinarily present as an alkali metal or ammonium salt, depending on the composition of the compounds used to maintain the alkalinity of the aqueous absorption medium. The thiosulfate concentration in the aqueous absorption medium of wet desulfurization systems tends to accumulate over time, since the aqueous medium ordinarily is regenerated and recirculated, only elemental sulfur being recovered from it. The rate of thiosulfate formation appears to be significantly increased by process solution temperatures above 400C, especially above 600C by high solution pH, above 8 and especially above 9 by high concentrations of dissolved oxygen in the aqueous absorption medium during the H2 S absorption step and for Stretford process solutions by low vanadium content in such solutions. In representative wet desulfurization processes, the amount of H2S which oxidizes to byproduct thiosulfate instead of the desired elemental sulfur may range from as low as 0.1 up to 5 6 or more of the absorbed H2S.The amount of H2S absorbed from the gas stream which forms byproduct thiosulfate is desirably maintained within 0.1 1 and preferably at about 0.1 0.2 , by weight. In a representative Stretford process treating a gas stream to reduce its H2S content from ah average of 1 3 to less than 5 ppm H2S in the exiting gas stream, about 0.2 of the absorbed H2S will form byproduct thiosulfate instead of elemental sulfur, if the process is operated efficiently. Conversion of 3 6 or more of the, absorbed H2S in a Stretford process to byproduct thiosulfate is deemed excessive. If allowed to accumulate unchecked in the recirculated absorption medium, thiosulfate will eventually reach a saturation concentration and begin to precipitate in the system. The gelatinous nature of thiosulfate salts makes their separation from the aqueous absorption medium extremely difficult by conventional filtration techniques.The gelatinous precipitate, if separated from the process solution, is likely to contain valuable oxidizing agents trapped within it, which is not amenable to recovery by washing and which may consequently be lost when the precipitate is discarded. High concentrations of thiosulfate in the recirculated aqueous absorption medium can also result in significant increases in the solution viscosity, especially when the thiosulfate concentration is in excess of 15 by weight, expressed as Na2S203. This typically results in undesirable process operating difficulties, as in pumping the aqueous absorption medium. Extremely high thiosulfate concentrations, in excess of about 15 by weight No 25203 and which are near the saturation point, may also have an adverse effect on the H2S oxidation reaction efficiency in the aqueous absorption medium. Consequently, the thiosulfate concentration is desirably maintained in the recirculated aqueous absorption medium at a level below about 15 by weight, expressed as Na2S203. The process of this invention employs a peroxygen chemical, preferably hydrogen peroxide, to control the level of thiosulfate in wet desulfurization systems, i.e., in the recirculated and regenerated aqueous absorption medium used in such systems. Sufficient hydrogen peroxide or other suitable peroxygen chemical is added to the wet desulfurization system aqueous absorption medium to maintain the level of thiosulfate below a saturation concentration. While hydrogen peroxide is most preferred as the peroxygen source, peroxygen chemicals such as sodium carbonate peroxide, sodium perborate, sodium pyrophosphate peroxide, sodium peroxide and urea peroxide may also be used. The reaction of the preferred hydrogen peroxide with thiosulfate in alkaline aqueous media appears to result in sulfate as the reaction product S203 4H2O2 20H 2504 5H2O The stoichiometry of this reaction requires four moles of hydrogen peroxide for each mole of thiosulfate.In a preferred embodiment of this invention, less than the stoichiometric amount of peroxide needed to oxidize thiosulfate to sulfate, i.e., a stoichiometric insufficiency, is introduced into the aqueous absorption medium. The level of thiosulfate in the aqueous absorption medium is desirably not reduced to a negligible concentration and is maintained at a concentration above 0.5 , preferably above about 5 by weight as Na2S203. The presence of such thiosulfate in the medium is apparently beneficial in lessening the destruction of the regenerable oxidizing agent. The presence of these amounts of thiosulfate appears to have no adverse effect on the efficiency of the aqueous absorption medium in its absorption of H2 S and in its oxidation of absorbed sulfide to elemental sulfur. It is clear, however, that the thiosulfate concentration must be maintained below a saturation concentration in the recirculated aqueous absorption medium. The amount of hydrogen peroxide or other peroxygen chemical employed should therefore be sufficient to maintain the thiosulfate concentration in the aqueous absorption medium below a saturation concentration and within a concentration range of from about 0.58 to 20 by weight, expressed as Na2S203, with about 5 to 15 being preferred.It should be apparent that the saturation concentration for thiosulfate in an aqueous absorption medium will vary with the temperature of the solution and with the presence of other chemical species oxidizing agent, alkalis and the like . The amount of the preferred hydrogen peroxide introduced into the S203 containing absorption medium ordinarily is between 0.1 to 3.9 moles per mole of thiosulfate present in the absorption medium. Preferably, from about 2 to 3 moles H202 per mole of thiosulfate are introduced into the aqueous absorption medium. Amounts of hydrogen peroxide exceeding 4 moles H202 per mole of thiosulfate may be used, but such amounts may have the effect of converting substantially all thiosulfate to sulfate, leaving no residual thiosulfate in the aqueous absorption medium. Hydrogen peroxide is preferred as the peroxygen since it decomposes into relatively innocuous byproducts, oxygen and water, which do not introduce additional chemical species in the aqueous absorption medium. However, dissolved oxygen from the decomposition of excess peroxide may cause absorbed hydrosulfide HS to become oxidized to thiosulfate. Excess hydrogen peroxide remaining in the aqueous absorption medium may also contribute to the decomposition of the regenerable oxidizing agent, since H202 is itself a strong oxidant. The hydrogen peroxide or peroxygen chemical may be added to the aqueous absorption medium at any point in the wet desulfurization system cycle. Superior results, however, are obtained when the peroxide is introduced into the aqueous absorption medium after it has been regenerated with an oxygen containing gas and, further, after recovery of the elemental sulfur therefrom and prior to its being contacted with H2S containing gas streams. Introduction of the peroxide into the aqueous absorption medium after regeneration of the medium minimizes undesirable reactions of peroxide with hydrosulfide to form thiosulfate or with the regenerable oxidizing agent. The peroxide may be added to the wet desulfurization system either continuously or periodically or intermittently, as desired, to control the thiosulfate concentration in the aqueous absorption medium. The peroxide addition is desirably intermittent, such as once every few days, because thiosulfate accumulation in the recirculating aqueous absorption medium is usually too slow to justify continuous introduction of peroxide. The manner in which the peroxide is introduced into the aqueous absorption medium is not critical. The reaction between the peroxide and thiosulfate is ordinarily rapid, within a few seconds or minutes, so long reaction residence times are not required. The peroxide treatment may be performed in a suitable reaction vessel, with the peroxide being pumped into and mixed with the aqueous absorption medium More preferably, the peroxide is injected directly into a stream of aqueous absorption medium, in a manner which provides for adequate mixing and reaction time before the treated stream is recirculated to the absorption unit. Hydrogen peroxide is desirably added to the aqueous absorption medium, as an aqueous solution, containing from 0.01 to 52 by weight H202. Preferably, an aqueous H202 solution containing from about 30 50 by weight H2O2 is employed. Peroxygen chemicals other than hydrogen peroxide are ordinarily introduced into the aqueous absorption medium as aqueous solutions, containing from 0.01 by weight up to saturation of the peroxygen chemical, saturated solutions being preferred. The temperature during the addition of the peroxide is not critical. Any temperature at which the wet desulfurization system process liquor is ordinarily maintained is satisfactory. Such temperatures may range between 20 to 500C, with 25 to 450C being preferred in most wet desulfurization systems. In the Stretford wet desulfurization process, for example, the process solution temperature is generally maintained around 400C. Since small amounts of peroxide are added relative to the amount of aqueous absorption medium, the introduction of the aqueous hydrogen peroxide or peroxygen chemical solution will ordinarily have little impact on the temperature of the medium to which it is added. The peroxide may therefore be at ambient temperature, preferably between 150C to 30 C, and introduced at that temperature into the aqueous absorption medium which is at its ordinary operating temperature. Pressure is not a critical factor. Atmospheric pressure is preferred during introduction of the peroxide to the aqueous absorption medium but subatmospheric pressure a partial vacuum is also feasible. The reaction of peroxide with thiosulfate results, as previously noted, in sulfate as the oxidation reaction product, which remains dissolved in the aqueous absorption medium. Sulfate salts, unlike thiosulfate salts, ordinarily precipitate as readily filterable crystals and present no special problems when recovered from wet desulfurization systems. The concentration of sulfate in the recirculating aqueous absorption medium is desirably maintained below a concentration at which sulfate salts begin to precipitate. If the sulfate concentration in the aqueous absorption medium does become excessive, approaching a saturation level, cdnventional crystallization techniques may be used to precipitate sulfates as alkali metal, alkaline earth metal, or ammonium salts. Crystallization may be effected, for example, by evaporative crystallization techniques or by cooling the aqueous absorption medium to lower the sulfate solubility. Sulfate may alternatively be precipitated as calcium sulfate by the addition of lime to the sulfate containing aqueous absorption medium. Regardless of the precipitation technique employed, the precipitated sulfate salt crystals are readily recovered from the aqueous absorption medium by conventional solids liquid separation procedures, e.g., filtration, settling decanting, and the like. The drawing illustrates the operation of a representative Stretford wet desulfurization process in which the recirculating thiosulfate containing process solution is treated according to the invention. Only the basic operations of a Stretford process are shown in the drawing, which is not intended to be a comprehensive layout illustrating all equipment and process steps for a commercialStretford process. The net result effected by the cyclic Stretford process is the indirect oxidation of absorbed hydrogen sulfide by oxygen gas air to form elemental sulfur H2S O2 Âµ S H20 A gas stream 1, e.g., a hydrogenated Claus process tail gas stream, containing about 1 3 hydrogen sulfide is passed upwardly through a gas absorber 100 and exits as a substantially H2S free gas stream 2, containing less than 5 ppm H2S, at the top of the absorber 100. Aqueous absorption solution 3 is introduced near the top of the absorber 100 and flows countercurrently to the gas stream, with which it is intimately contacted. The aqueous absorption medium, i.e., Stretford solution, is an alkaline solution which has a pH above 7, preferably between about 8.0 to 9.5. The alkalinity of the Stretford solution is maintained by the addition of alkali such as caustic soda caustic potash ammonia sodium, potassium or ammonium carbonates or bicarbonates or organic bases such as alkanolamines. Sodium carbonate and bicarbonate are usually preferred, being present in amounts of about 1 8 g Na2CO3 and 10 30 g NaHCO3 liter Stretford solution. Ammonium alkalis may be preferred, under some circumstances, for controlling alkalinity since their use appears to reduce the rate of thiosulfate formation. This apparently is due to the buffering action of the ammonia which facilitates pH maintenance below 9.0. The Stretford solution also contains an anthraquinone disulfonate ADA , preferably the 2,6 and 2,7 disodium salt isomers. The ADA concentration in the Stretford solution is typically 0.3 3 g ADA calculated as the disodium salt liter, preferably 2.5 g liter Stretford solution. In addition to the ADA, a water soluble vanadium compound is present, usually as an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal or ammonium salt, sodium vanadate being preferred. The Stretford solution ordinarily contains about 0.3 6 g V as metal liter Stretford solution. Other chemicals, particularly sesquestering agents or chelating agents like citrates, tartrates, borates or phosphates, may also be present to enhance the water solubility of the vanadate and or act as buffering agents. The Stretford solution is maintained at a temperature of about 400C so as to minimize thiosulfate formation which increases at higher temperatures and to maintain satisfactory vanadate reaction efficiency which decreases at lower temperatures . The H2S is absorbed from the gas stream 1 into theStretford solution in the absorber 100 and exits in the liquid stream 4. The absorbed H2S is present in the Stretford solution as a dissolved sodium hydrosulfide NaHS , because of the reaction of sodium carbonate present in the Stretford solution with the H2S H2S Na2C03 NaHS NaRC03 The hydrosulfide is oxidized to elemental sulfur by its reaction with the water soluble vanadate salt 2NaVO3 NaHS NaHC03 S Na2V205 Na2C03 H2 A small portion, about 0.2 , of the absorbed hydrogen sulfide, however, reacts to form sodium thiosulfate byproduct which accumulates in the recirculated Stretford solution. The liquid stream 4 exiting from the absorber 100 may be retained in a holding tank not shown in the drawing to promote completion of the hydrosulfide oxidation to sulfur and allow the elemental sulfur to precipitate. The liquid stream 4 from the absorber 100 is passed to an oxidizer reaction tank 200. Air 5 is sparged into the sulfur containing suspension contained in the oxidizer 200. The air introduced into the oxidizer 200 as the oxygen source, serves to regenerate the reduced oxidizing agent, and the ADA is also regenerated at the same time Na2V2O5 ADA oxidized 2NaVO3 ADA reduced ADA reduced air air dADA oxidized Regeneration of the reduced oxidizing agent converts the vanadium from a 4 valence state back a 5 valance state as the vanadate, with the ADA present in solution serving as the oxidation catalyst and or oxygen carrier. The introduction of sparged air into the oxidizer 200 also causes finely divided particles of elemental sulfur to rise to the top as a froth, which is skimmed off as a sulfur froth overflow 6. The sulfur froth 6 is dewatered in a sulfur filter 300 and the sulfur cake 8 autoclaved not shown to yield pure 99.9 solid sulfur. The filtrate 9 from the sulfur filter 300 may be combined with relatively sulfur free solution 7 which is withdrawn from the oxidizer 200. This sulfur free solution stream 10 constitutes regenerated Stretford solution, which contains sodium thiosulfate byproduct dissolved in it. In accordance with the practice of this invention, the thiosulfate containing, regenerated Stretford solution 10 is treated with sufficient aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution 11, 35 by weight H2O2, to maintain the thiosulfate concentration below a saturation level about 20 by weight Na2S203 , and preferably in the range of 5 15 by weight Na2S2O3. The aqueous hydrogen peroxide 11 is introduced into the sulfur free regenerated Stretford solution 10 in a mixing operation, hereinafter referred to as H 202 treatment 400, on an intermittent basis, preferably once every one to six months. The aqueous hydrogen peroxide 10 is added whenever the thiosulfate level in the recirculating. Stretford solution approaches a saturation concentration. This may conveniently be monitored by periodically measuring the specific gravity of the recirculating Stretford solution, since a specific gravity in excess of about 1.2 ordinarily indicates the presence of a high thiosulfate concentration, nearing a saturation level. The H2O2 treatment 400 is preferably carried out via injecting the aqueous hydrogen peroxide into the Stretford solution in a mixing zone, such as in line pipe mixer, which assures adequate residence time for reaction prior to the treated Stretford solution 3 being returned to the absorber 100. After the H202 treatment 400, the regenerated andH202 treated Stretford solution 3 is recycled to the absorber 100 to contact the H2S containing gas stream 1. The recirculated Stretford solution 3 may be treated as necessary, usually at infrequent intervals, to recover the sulfate which accumulates as thiosulfate is oxidized with hydrogen peroxide. Typically, recovery of sulfate may be accomplished by cooling a side stream of regeneratedStretford solution not shown below its ordinary operating temperature to crystallize from solution sodium sulfate, which precipitates as a readily filterable solid salt.After separation of the solid sodium sulfate from the slurry by filtration, the sulfate free mother liquor is returned to the main body of recirculating Stretford solution being recycled to the absorber 100. EXAMPLES An aqueous solution corresponding to thiosulfatefree Stretford process liquor was prepared, by mixing appropriate amounts of the named components in water to obtain the following composition anthraquinone 2,7 disulfonic acid disodium salt 0.25 weight percent vanadium pentoxide 0.44 weight percent sodium hydroxide 0.39 weight percent sodium bicarbonate 2.50 weight percent sodium carbonate 1.09 weight percent and water 95.33 weight percent . The pH of the solution was 9.4, and its density was 1.03 g ml. A standard procedure was employed in examples in which this Stretford process solution was used to treat hydrogen sulfide gas. In this cyclic procedure, hydrogen sulfide gas 100 H2S was bubbled into 200 ml of Stretford solution, contained in a 250 ml gas washing bottle, at a temperature of 450C for a ten minute period. During the absorption of the H2S gas, the color of the Stretford solution changed rapidly from a clear orange to a very dark brown. Following the H2S absorption, air was bubbled through this Stretford solution until the color of the solution reverted to its original clear orange. This aeration step typically required between 76 to 111 minutes. The finely divided solid sulfur which had formed from the oxidation of the H2 S during the previous steps was thereafter recovered by vacuum filtration. The filter cake was water washed and dried at a temperature of 950C to constant weight. The water washes were discarded, since their addition to the mother liquor would have resulted in an unwanted dilution of the mother liquor. The mother liquor remaining after recovery of the sulfur, i.e., regenerated Stretford solution, was reused to treat more H2 S gas in the same manner as described above. The H2S absorption oxidation regeneration procedure was repeated five times using the mother liquor from the immediately previous run. Upon the conclusion of the six cycle procedure in the examples, the mother liquor was analyzed for vanadium content, by atomic absorption, and for sodium thiosulfate content, by titration. Thiosulfate content was determined by adding 1 ml formaldehyde to an aliquot of solution and titrating it with 0.lN iodine solution. Thiosulfate content is reported as percent by weight Na2S2O3. The Table summarizes the parameter values employed and the analytical results from the examples in whichH2S gas was treated with Stretford solution in the abovementioned procedure. Examples A and B are comparative examples, and Examples 1, 2 and 3 illustrate an embodiment of the invention the details of each of these examples are described below. Comparative Example A was a control in which no hydrogen peroxide was added to the Stretford solution.Two hundred ml of Stretford solution were employed to treat H2S gas in the six cycle H2S absorption oxidationregeneration procedure described above. Thiosulfate content in the final cycle mother liquor was 6.1 g 0.038 g mole . The mother liquor contained 88 of the vanadium originally present in the first cycleStretford solution. The pH of the final cycle mother liquor was 9.2. An average of 0.88 g sulfur was recovered in each of the six cycles. In Example 1, 200 ml of Stretford solution was used to treat H2S gas following the standard procedure. However, Example 1 differed from Comparative Example A in that 1 ml of aqueous hydrogen peroxide 50 by weight H2O2 was added to the Stretford solution following the aeration step, prior to the recovery of the sulfur by filtration, in each of the six cycles. The total amount of aqueous hydrogen peroxide added was therefore 6 ml 7.2 g 50 H202 0.105 g mole , which was stoichiometrically sufficient to react with 0.026 g mole Na2S2O3. The final cycle mother liquor in Example 1 contained only 1.9 g Na2S2O3 0.012 g mole , which was 4.2 g 0.026 g mole less than in Comparative Example A. It retained 84 of the original vanadium. The pH of the final cycle mother liquor was 8.4. An average of 0.77 g sulfur was recovered in each cycle. In Comparative Example B, 30 g sodium thiosulfate 0.190 g mole was added to 200 g of Stretford solution, so as to provide a substantial thiosulfate concentration in the solution even prior to its first contact with H2S gas. Two hundred ml of the S203 containing Stretford solution was used to treat H2S gas in the standard procedure described above. No hydrogen peroxide was added at any point in this comparative example. After 6 cycles of H2S absorption oxidation regeneration, the final cycle mother liquor contained 32.5 g Na2S2O3 0.205 g mole , an increase of about 2.5 g 0.015 g mole over the initial Stretford solution Na2S203 content. Vanadium retention was 68 , somewhat lower than in previous examples. The final cycle mother liquor had a pH of 9.2. An average of 0.93 g sulfur was recovered in each cycle. In Example 2 the Stretford solution was dosed with thiosulfate in a manner identical to that of ComparativeExample B. The same procedure as used in ComparativeExample B was followed except that 1 ml of aqueous hydrogen peroxide 50 by weight B2 2 was added to the Stretford solution after aeration in each of the six cycles. A total of 6 ml 7.2 g 50 H2O2 aqueous hydrogen, peroxide, which corresponded to 0.105 g mole H202 was therefore added. This amount of H 202 was stoichiometrically sufficient to react with 0.026 g mole Na2S2O3. The final cycle mother liquor in Example 2 contained 27.1 g Na2S2O3 0.171 g mole , representing a decrease of about 2.9 g 0.018 g mole over the initial Stretford solution Nazi203 content. It retained 96 of the original vanadium. The final cycle mother liquor pH was 8.4.An average of 1.06 g sulfur per cycle was recovered. In Example 3, 15 g Na2S2O3 0.095 g mole was added to 200 g Stretford solution, and 200 ml of this solution was employed in the Example. The Stretford solution was contacted with H2S gas using the standard HZS absorption oxidation regeneration procedure. After the aeration step in each of the six cycles in Example 3, 0.5 ml aqueous hydrogen peroxide 50 by weight H2O2 was added to the solution. A total of three ml 3.6 g 508 H2O2 aqueous hydrogen peroxide, corresponding to 0.053 g mole H2O2, was therefore added. This amount of H202 was stoichiometrically sufficient to react with 0.013 g mole Na2S2O3. At the conclusion of the sixth cycle in Example 3, the mother liquor contained 17.3 g Na2S203 0.109 gmole , an increase of about 2.3 g 0.014 g mole over the starting Stretford solution Na2S203 content. This thiosulfate increase was substantially less than that which might be anticipated for a similar control example involving no H202 treatment of the Stretford solution.An increase in thiosulfate of about 4.5 g would be expected with no H2O2 treatment, based on the 6.1 g increase in Comparative Example A and 2.5 g increase in Comparative Example B. The final cycle mother liquor in Example 3 retained 90 of the original vanadium. Its pH was 8.8. An average of 0.98 g sulfur per cycle was recovered. In Example 4, the thiosulfate saturation level was determined for the Stretford solution described above, at a temperature of 500C. Sodium thiosulfate was added gradually with stirring to 200 ml Stretford solution, having a composition as noted above, until the continued presence of undissolved solid Na2S203 indicated a saturated solution had been achieved. The mixture was filtered to separate the solids, and the clear filtrate was analyzed for its thiosulfate content. An average of 4 trials in Example 4 indicated the saturated Stretford solution contained 21.08 by weight Na2S2O3, which was equivalent to 26.7 parts by weight Na2S203 per Loo parts thiosulfate free Stretford solution.
