## Description
DESCRIPTION NEW PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS This invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising a prostanol derivative as active ingredient. The known prostanol derivative 2 hydroxymethyl l6 phenoxy l5 oxo 13, 14 dihydro 2 decarboxy ll,lS dideoxy 17,18,19,20 tetranorprosta glandin E, described, for example, in British PatentNo. 1581886 and hereinafter referred to as oxoprostol has particular utility in the alleviation of gastric ulceration and gastric hyperacidity, more especially by oral administration. Oxoprostol is an oil of very low solubility in water or aqueous media. According to the present invention, there are provided pharmaceutical compositions comprising particles of a water soluble pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which carrier consists essentially of particles of a neutral inorganic salt, for example sodium chloride, or a hexahydric alcohol, for example sorbitol or mannitol, or a neutral mono or di saccharide, in particular lactose, and which particles have on their surface a substantially uniform film of oxoprostol, the particle size of the carrier being such that on mixing with water rapid dissolution of the carrier takes place. By rapid dissolution .it is meant that when 0.5 g of the carrier is added to 500 ml of water at 370C in a standard U.S.P. paddle dissolution apparatus, with a stirring rate of 50 revolutions per minute, no particles of the carrier remain visible to the nsked eye after 2.5 minutes. The more rapidly soluble the carrier is in water, the larger its particle size may be but, in general, carriers comprising greater than 95 by weight of particles having a maximum dimension of from 1 to 400 microns are suitable. Preferably the particles have a median maximum dimension of not greater than 200 microns. Lactose, anhydrous, U.S.P. is preferred as the carrier. Preferably, the carrier contains not more than 1.5 wiw weight weight , and more particularly not more than 1 w w, of water. The ratio by weight of oxoprostol to carrier may be from 0.0001 1 to 1 1 and is preferably from 0.005 1 to 0.1 1. The particulate pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention possess the particularly advantageous and unexpected property that when mixed with water or a substantially aqueous media, for example the contents of the stomach, a relatively stable emulsion is formed, without the necessity of incorporating surface sctive agents, which renders them particularly suitable for oral administration for the alleviation of gastric ulceration and gastric hyperacidity by making the oxoprostol available for local action and producing good absorption through the gastric lining.Thus, a particulate pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention comprising oxoprostol coated on the surface of particles of Lactose, anhydrous, U.S.P. in the ratio by weight of oxoprostol to Lactose, anhydrous, U.S.P. of 0.02 to 1, when dissolved with gentle agitation in water in the amount of 1 g of composition to 10 ml of water, forms an emulsion which is stable under visual examination for two days. Particulate pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention may be prepared by dissolving the oxoprostol in an inert organic solvent or a mixture of inert organic solvents in which the oxoprostol is soluble, and preferably at least 55 weight volume w v soluble, and in which the carrier is substantially insoluble, i.e. preferably not more than 0.15 w v soluble, contacting the oxoprostol solution with the carrier, for example by spraying the solution onto the carrier or mixing the solution with the carrier with agitation, to achieve uniform coating of the carrier particles with the oxoprostol solution, and drying the product to remove the organic solvent.The temperature at which the product is dried will depend on the solvent selected for the coating process but should not exceed 80 C and should preferably be below 450C. Reduced atmospheric pressure may advantageously be used to increase the rate of solvent evaporation at any given temperature. Suitable solvents have boiling points lower than about 1000C, and preferably lower than 500C, measured at normal atmospheric pressure. Dichloromethane is a particularly suitable solvent. The presence of impurities, and in particular basic impurities, in the solvent may cause catalytic degeneration of the oxoprostol and, accordingly, the use of solvents containing such impurities should be avoided. For oral administration for the alleviation of gastric ulceration and gastric hyperacidity, particulate pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention may be dissolved in water and the emulsion thus obtained may be administered orally or, as is preferred, particulate pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention may be formulated into conventional pharmaceutical compositions suitable for oral administration, for example compressed into tablets or placed in capsules of absorbable material such as gelatin, with conventional excipients, for example diluents, e.g.lactose, disintegrating agents, e.g. sodium starch glycollate or microcrystalline cellulose, and small amounts, e.g. up to 5 w w, of lubricating agents or glidants, e.g. stearic acid, magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulphate, magnesium l,uryl sulphate or talc, to facilitate the handling and flow properties of the composition. Particulate pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention may, if desired, be prepared and stored under sterile, aseptic conditions and mixed with sterile water at the time of use, to give extemporaneous sterile emulsions containing oxoprostol suitable for parenteral administration, e.g.intravenous injection. For the treatment of adult patients with gastric ulceration and of adult patients with gastric hyperacidity, pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention may normally be administered at rates which give oral doses of between 0.001 and 1.0 mg, and particularly of between 0.001 and 0.02 mg, of oxoprostol per kg body weight administered 2, 3 or 4 times per day, or doses of between 0.002 and 2.0 mg of oxoprostol per kg body weight by intravenous injection. The following non limitative Examples illustrate the present invention EXAMPLE 1 A solution of oxoprostol 0.52 g in dichloromethane 20 ml was added in small portions toLactose, anhydrous, U.S.P. 10.4 g over a period of 30 minutes whilst the lactose was continuously stirred in a mixer. The dichloromethane was then ellowed to evaporate at ambient temperature over a period of 30 minutes. The coated lactose particles thus obtained 10.0 g were placed in a salable glass jar to whichLactose, anhydrous, U.S.P. 89.5 g was then added.The jar was placed on a Turbula TC2 mixer and mixed for thirty minutes. Magnesium stearate 0.5 g was then added and mixing was continued for 1 minute. A sample 1 g of the powder thus obtained was added to water 10 ml with gentle agitation. An emulsion in which no individual oily droplets could be distinguished by the naked eye and which remained stable and visually unchanged for two days was thus obtained. Similar results were obtained when the water was replaced by 0.01N and 0.1N hydrochloric acid. The remainder of the powder was then filled in 100 g portions each containing 0.5 mg of oxoprostol into No. 3 hard gelatin capsules using a Tevopharm semi automatic capsule filling machine. A capsule thus obtained was placed in a standard dissolution vessel containing 0.1N hydrochloric acid 600 ml and formed in 3 to 4 minutes a dilute emulsion in which no individual oily droplets could be distinguished by the naked eye. EXAMPLE 2 Oxoprostol 0.52 g was dissolved in dichloromethane 20 ml and the solution thus obtained was sterilized by passage through a 0.2 micron solvent resistant filter. Lactose, anhydrous. U.S.P. 10.4 g was sterilized by dry heating in an oven at 1500C for one hour. The solution was then added to the lactose over a period of 30 minutes with continuous stirring in a mixer under aseptic conditions. The dichloromethane was then allowed to evaporate over a period of 30 minutes at ambient temperature, again under aseptic conditions. The powder was then filled in 1 g portions into sterile glass vials 20 mls , which were then sealed with a rubber plug. The introduction of sterile water for injection 10 ml through the rubber plug by means of a hypodermic needle, gave a sterile emulsion suitable for injection, which could be withdrawn through the plug by means of the hypodermic needle, each ml of emulsion containing 0.5 mg of oxoprostol.
