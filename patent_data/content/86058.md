# Resin composition excellent in drawability.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a resin composition excellent in the drawa bility, which comprises A a saponified ethylenevinyl ester copolymer having an ethylene content of 20 to 55 mole and a saponification degree of at least 95 , B a saponified ethylene vinyl ester copolymer having an ethylene content of 25 to 60 mole and a saponification degree of at least 90 , the ethylene content of the saponified copolymer B being higher by at least 3 mole than the ethylene content of the saponified copolymer A , and C a polyamide, wherein the weight ratio of the saponified copolymer A to the saponified copolymer B is in the range of from 90 10 to 10 90 and the weight ratio of the sum of the saponified copolymers A and B to the polyamide C is in the range of from 95 5 to 5 95.
