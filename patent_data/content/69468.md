## Abstract
A dry shaver comprising a body 11 , drive means within the body, a cutter 13 driven by the drive means, and a perforated foil 10 disposed over the cutter, has a light source 16 arranged to direct light through the foil 10 on to the face of a user.

## Claims
CLAIS 1. A dry shaver comprising a body containing a drive motor, a cutter arranged to be driven by said motor, a perforated foil disposed over and in contact with said cutter and mounted on said body, and a light source supported by said body for illuminating the face of the user, characterised in that said light source is arranged to direct light outwardly through said foil. 2. A dry shaver according to claim 1 characterised by a light diffuser mounted beneath said foil, said light source being arranged to direct light through said diffuser. 3. A dry shaver according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised by one or more light diffusers disposed externally of the body and operative to direct light from the light source on to the face of the user.

## Description
Illuminated Shaver SHAVING APPARATUSThis invention relates to dry shavers, and in particular electric dry shavers, sometimes referred to as electric razors.When a person is shaving with adryshaver, he frequently finds that there is not sufficient light falling on his face from a natural or artificial Source.It is known to provide a dry shaver comprising a body containing a drive motor, a cutter arranged to be driven by said motor, a perforated foil disposed over and in contact with said cutter and mounted on said body, and a light source supported by said body for illuminating the face of the user.The illumination from such a source does not necessarily fall in the immediate vicinity of the part of the face contacted by the dry shaver.According to the present invention, said light source is arranged to direct light outwardly through said foil.Two forms of dry shaver in accordance with the ptesent invention will now be described by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a perspective view, part cutaway, of a dry shaver containing a lamp arranged to direct light through a foil andFigure 2 is a perspective view of a second form of dry shaver, part cutaway to show a lamp arranged to direct light through and around the outside of the foil.As shown in Figure 2, the dry shaver includes a stationary perforated foil 10 mounted on a body or casing 11 and in contact with a cutter 12 formed by a plurality of parallel spaced cutter bars or discs 13. The cutter is movable along a line parallel to the axis of curvature of the foil 10 to shear off hairs protruding through the perforations of the foil.Within the casing are one or more electric lamps 16, arranged to direct light outwardly through a pair of elongate half cylindrical diffusers 14 disposed below the cutter 12 to direct light through the perforations of the foil 10.In the embodiment of Figures 1 and 2, some light will be interrupted by the cutter, but a substantial amount of light will still be allowed to pass through the stationary foil directly on to the face of the person shaving, and in the immediate vicinity of the part of the face being shaved.In the embodiment of Figure 2, two diffusers 18 are shown extending parallel to the stationary foil externally thereof and immediately adjacent thereto to receive light from the lamps 16 only one of which is shown within the casing 11 and to transmit the light directly onto the face of the person shaving. This will be in addition to light which will pass outwardly through the foil as described above. In each of the embodiments described above, the lamp can be a low voltage bulb supplied from a battery within the shaver for example a rechargeable battery or via a mains operated transformer. The lamp will normally be switchable independently of the operation of the cutter, but could be arranged to be energised by energisation of the cutter.Although reference has been made above to the transmission of light through diffusers, the latter being provided to avoid the passage of hairs into the lamp housing, light pipes or fibre optics could be utilised to transmit the light from the bulb to its point of emission within, or externally of, the stationary foil.
