# ARTIFICIAL FUEL AND FIRE

## Abstract
An improved artificial fuel for use, loose, in simulated solid fuel fires to give the appearance and heat output of an open fire, wherein to form the fuel use is made of refractory ceramic fibre, bonded into an open structure that consists essentially of fibres, bonded where they cross and having free spaces between them, rather than a fired mass contain ing embedded fibres, the porosity of the structure being at least of the order of 60 but preferably more, advantageous ly 75 to 85 , and both fibre and bonding agent being capable of continuous service at not less than 1000 C.
