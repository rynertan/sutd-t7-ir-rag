# IMPROVED PROCESS AND APPARATUS FOR PREPARING LAMINATED HEAT SHRINKABLE STRIP WITH ELECTRIC CONDUCTOR WIRE EMBEDDED THEREIN

## Abstract
There are provided improved process and apparatus for preparing a laminated heat shrinkable strip comprising upper and lower heat shrinkable sheets fused together with an electric conductor wire sandwiched therebetween as means for covering and protecting joints of steel pipes of oil pipelines or cables. The process comprises the steps of subjecting successive sections of a starting strip with the sheets unfused, while said section are stationary, to a pressing operation, each operation consisting of simul taneously prehot pressing a first length which is slightly longer than half a predetermined length, hot pressing a second length which is adjacent to said first length and which is the same or longer than said predetermined length, and cold pressing a third length which is adjacent to said second length and which is slightly longer than half said predetermined length, and shifting forward said starting strip by an amount corresponding to half said predetermined length after completion of each said pressing operation and before the start of each next pressing operation. The apparatus comprises a prehot press, a main hot press and a cold press arranged in a series for carrying out the pressing operation and a conveyor system for the intermittent shifting operation wherein a pair of looped teflon belts of a webbed pattern between which the starting strip is sandwiched, the strip being subjected to the pressures by the presses through the belts.
