# Rotor and method of making same.

## Abstract
A method of making a rotor 25 of a fluid energy trans lating device wherein the rotor 25 has an annular passage 47 entirely within the rotor 25 , a plurality of radially extending vane slots 35 intersecting the passage and axial openings 49 intersecting the annular passage 47 . The method comprises forming an annular groove 52, 61, 72 in the periphery of a solid body 50, 60, 70 , closing the open side of the groove to provide the annular passage 47 , forming radial vane slots 35 in the body 50, 60, 70 inter secting the annular passage 47 , and forming axial open ings 49 in the body intersecting the annular passage.
