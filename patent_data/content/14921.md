## Description
COATING COMPOSITIONS AND PROCESSES The present invention relates to coating compositions and to processes for preparing such com positions. The coating compositions are particularly useful in preparing coated layers on photographic elements. Hydrophobes can become associated with latex polymer particles in an aqueous dispersion.These latices, wherein the idividual latex polymer particles have associated therewith a hydrophobe, are referred herein to as loaded latices . These loaded latices are useful in providing aqueous coating compositions of hydrophobic materials which might otherwise have to be coated or applied from an organic solvent containing composition. For example, in the photographic arts many of the image forming layers are hydrophilic, yet many of the useful photographic chemicals are hydrophobic. Thus, while the coating processes as a whole are adapted to applying aqueous coatings, photographic addenda such as color couplers, developing agents, UV absorbers and the like must be either dissolved in an organic solvent and dispersed as oil droplets in photographic emulsions or coated from organic solvents.By virtue of the latex loading technique, these hydrophobic photographic components can now be associated with polymeric latex particles and can therefore be coated from aqueous coating compositions. A latex loading process is described inResearch Disclosure, Vol. 159, item 15930, July, 1977. In one preferred embodiment of this described process, the hydrophobe to be loaded is dissolved in a water miscible organic solvent. This organic solution of the hydrophobe is then blended with an aquetur dispersion of the polymerie latex particles.while come inading of the hydrophobe takes place upon biending, lcading is greatly enhanced by removing the ergenie solvent from the mixture. In this manner, the nydrophche becomes loaded onto or into the pilymer particles of the latex, i.e., associated with ydrsphobes are described in the aboveidentified Besearch Dischlosure as compounds which are essentially incoluble in distilled water of 25 C. ne dissolved concentration of hydrophobe in a saturated aqueaus solution under these conditions is less than abour 0,5 by weight, based on the weight of the solution. While this definition defines hydrophobes which are injeed quite hydrophoble, many compounds are extremele insoluble, which results in saturated water solutions which are considerably less than 0,5 by weight of the compound. The above identified Research Disclosure deseriber a wide variety of latices which can be loaded at crclng to the described procedure. Any latex which eats ne Loadable Polymer Particle Test as describhat Research Disclosure is useful. Polymer particles which are particularly useful are polymer particles made from ethylenically unsaturated monomers.One specific polymer which is listed as being useful is a poly n buty acrylate co 2 acrylamido 2 methylpropanesulfonic acid . Extremely insoluble hydrophobes are successfully loaded into this and similar vinyl polymer particles. However, the resulting loaded latex dispersion is generally not storagestable. Typically, the highly hydrophobic compound will crystalize and precipitate from the loaded latex after a short period of time. While this short period of tire for example, a few hours or less, is sufficiently lcng to allow for coating of the composition, it would be desirable to be able to prepare coating compositions containing loaded latices which are storage stable for longer periods of time. A coating composition comprising a latex having water as a continuous phase and, as a dispersed phase, hydrophobic polymer particles having associated therewith a water miscible organic solvent soluble hydrophobic compound, of improved stability, can be prepared when the hydrophobic polymer particles comprise a polyurethane polymer. Polyurethane latices provide loaded latices which are stable for comparatively long periods. While loaded vinyl polymer latices of highly hydrophobic materials might be stable for 1 to 2 hours or less, loaded polyurethane latices of highly hydrophobic materials are typically stable for weeks or even months. Some hydrophobes which are particularly difficult to load may not form loaded latices which are stable for long periods, even with polyurethane latices. However, the polyurethane latices loaded with these difficult to load hydrophobes will be comparatively more stable than other classes of latices loaded with these same hydrophobes. Similarly, hydrophobes which are particularly easy to load will form loaded latices which are stable for long periods with latices other than polyurethane polymers. Preferred polyurethane polymers are derived from a polyol component and an isocyanate component.The polyol component comprises a from 10 100 mole percent of the total polyol present of one or a mixture of prepolymers having at least two hydroxy groups and a molecular weight from 300 20,000, the recurring units in the pre polymer being lower alkyl ether or lower alkyl ester and b from 90 0 mole percent based on the total polyol present of 2 low moleaulat weight diol with or without a r. t or.a group to impart a positive cr a negative charge.The isocyanate mponent conforms to the structureOCNRNCO wherein R is alkylene, cycloalkylene, arylene, alkylenetisarylene or arylenebisalkylene. Particularly preferred polyurethane latices are derived fror caprelactone containing prepolymers.These polyurethane latices exhibit still greater stability when loaded with hydrophobic compounds. While the stability of polyurethane latices which are loaded with any hydrophobic compound is expected to be improved relative to loaded vinyl polymer latives, the enhanced stability is particularly important when the polyurethane latices are loaded with highly hydrophobic compounds. By highly hydrophobic it is meant that the compounds are essentially insoluble in 250 C distilled water to the extent that the dissolved concentration of a saturated water solu tion of the compound is less than 0.1 by weight, based on the total weight of the solution. Polyurethane latices are well known in the art.Any polyurethane latex which meets the loaded polymerparticle test is useful according to the present in invention. Useful polyurethane latices are described, for example, in b Patents 2,968,575, 3,213,049, 3,294,724, 3,565,844, 3,388,087, 3,479,310 and 3,873,484. Generally, polyurethane latices are prepared by chain extending a prepolymer which is the reaction product of a diisocyanate and an organic compound having two active hydrogen atoms. Useful types of organic compounds which have two active hydrogen atoms include polyalkylene ether glycols, alkyd resins, polyesters and polyester amides. Poly urethane latices are generally prepared by emulsifying the prepolymer and then chain extending the prepolymer in the presence of a chain extending agent such as water. The compositions of the present invention are formed from latices. The terms latices , latex and latex dispersion refer to a two phase composition wherein water is the major component of the continuous phase. The disperse phase comprises minute hydrophobic polyurethane polymer particles. In a latex, as defined for the purpose of the present invention, the hydrophobic particles have a size range of from 0.02 to 0.2 micron, as distinguished from a suspension where the particles are usually much larger, e.g., 0.5 micron or larger. Useful polyurethane latices are neutral or they are anionically or cationically stabilized. Anionically and cationically stabilized polyurethane latices are formed by incorporating charged groups into the polyurethane. Useful groups which impart a negative charge to the latex include carboxylate, sulfonate and the like. Useful repeating units are derived from polyol monomers containing these acidic functional groups such as 2,2 bis hydroxymethyl propionje acid,N,N bis 2 hydroxyethyl glycine and the like. Useful groups which impart a positive charge to the latex include quaternized amines, sulfonium salt, phosphinates and the like. Useful repeating units are derived from polyol monomers containing a tertiary amine or thio functional group such as N methyldiethanolamine, 2,2 thioethanol and the like.Useful examples of anionically and cationically stabilized polyurethane latices are described in US Patent 3,479,310. Particularly useful latices are cationically stabilized latices such as those described in US Patent 3,873,484. Preferred polyurethane latices are derived from prepolymers represented by the structure EMI6.1 wherein R is alkylene of about 2 to 40 carbon atoms, alkylene containing hetero atoms such as oxygen cycloalkylene, such as cyclohexylene, alkylenebiscyclohexylene and isophorone 1,4 diyl arylene including substituted arylene such as phenylene, naphthylene and tolylene alkylenebisarylene arylenebisalkylene and the like all preferably containing 6 to 15 carbon atoms R1 is EMI6.2 R2, R3 and R5 are independently selected from the group consisting of alkylene of about 2 10 carbon atoms, cycloalkylenebis oxyalkylene such as 1,4cyclohexylenebis oxyethylene , arylenebisalkylene such as phenylenebismethylene and the residue of a 2 500 repeating unit poly alkylene oxide group wherein the alkylene portion has about 2 5 carbon atoms R is alkylene having from about 2 10 carbon atoms R6 is alkylene having from about 2 10 carbon atoms or arylene as mentioned for R each Z is independently 0 or N p and n are independently integers from 2 500 m is O or 1 y is 0 90 mole percent of the diol component x is correspondingly 100 10 mole percent of the diol component and z is between 1.1 and 2.0. The minimum amount of isocyanate is that amount which is just sufficient to provide terminal isocyanate groups on both ends of the prepolymer, i.e., just over 1 mole of diisocyanate per mole of diol, i.e., z 1. Preferably, the ratio is closer to 2 moles of diisocyanate per mole of diol. Particularly preferred polyurethane latices are derived from glycol endcapped polycaprolactones.These polyurethanes are represented in the above formula when m is 1 and Z is O. A wide variety of polyols and diisocyanates are optionally use to form the stable loaded latex according to the present invention. Useful polyols include 1 diols such as alkylene diols of 2 10 carbon atoms, arylene diols such as hydroqunione, and polyether diols HO RO nH where R is alkylene such as poly propylene glycol, for example, Pluracol P 2010TM,Pluracol P 1010TM sold by BASF Wyandotte and NiaxPPG 2025TM sold by Union Carbide 2 triols such as glycerol, 2 ethyl 2 hydroxymethyl 1, 30 propane diol, l,l,l trimethylolpropane and 1,2,6 hexenetriol and 3 tetraols such as pentaerthyritol higher polyols such as sorbitol and the poly oxyalkylene derivatives of the polyhydric alcohols mentioned. Other desirable polyols include linear polyesters of molecular weight of about 500 with terminal hydroxyl groups, low acid numbers and water content block copolymers of ethylene and propylene oxides with a diamine such as ethylenediamine and cap rolactone polymers having end hydroxyl groups. Typical diisocyanates which are useful in forming the loadable polyurethane latices according to the present invention include 2,4 and 2,6 toluenediisocyanete, diphenylmethane 4,4 diisocyanate, diphenylmethane 4,4 diisocyanate, polymethylenediphenylene isocyantes, bitoluene diisocyanate, dianisidine diisocyanate, 1,5 naphthalene diisocyanate, 1,6 hexamethylene diisocyanate, bis isocyanatocyclonexyl methane diisocyanate, isophorone dilsocyanate, 2,2,4 trimethylhexane diisocyanate and xylene dlisocyanate. The prepolymer is typically prepared by mixing the polyol and the diisocyanate, under nitrogen with agitation. Temperatures of from about 250 C to about 1100 C are useful. The reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of a solvent and, optionally, in the presence of a catalyst. Useful solvents include ketones and esters, aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents such as heptanes, octanes and the like, and cycloaliphatie hydrocarbons such as methylcyclohexane, and the like. Useful catalysts include tertiary amines, acids and organometallic compounds such as triethylamine, stannous chloride and di n butyl tin dilaurate. Where the polyol and isocyanates are liquids and where the prepolymer is also a liquid, the organic solvent is optional. After the prepolymer Is prepared, a latex is formed by emulsifying the prepolymer and chainextending it in the presence of water. Emulsification of the prepolymer may occur in the presence of a surfactant. Where the prepolymer contains charged groups, it may not be necessary to add additional eurfactant.Chain extension of the prepolymer is accomplished by adding a chain extending agent to the emulsified prepolymer. Useful chain extending agents include those compounds having at least two functional groups bearing an active hydrogen atom. Typical examples include water, hyorazine, primary and secondary diamines, amino alcohols, amino acids, hydroxy acids, diols, or mixtures thereof. A preferred group of chain extending agents includes water and primary and secondary diamines,Preferred diamines include 1,4 cyclobexenebie methyl amine , ethylenediamine, diethylenetriamine and the like. The amount of chain extending agent is typically equal to the isocyanate equivalent of prepolymer. The polyurethane latex must be loadable. By loadable it is meant that the polyurethane polymer particles being tested must a be capable of forming a latex with water at a polymer particle concentration of from 10 20 percent by weight, based on the total weight of latex, and b when 100 mL. of latex is then mixed with an equal volume of the water miscible organic solvent to be employed when forming the loaded polymeric latex composition desired, stirred and allowed to stand for 10 minutes, exhibit no observable coagulation of the polymer particles. These conditIons must be met with the latex in question at 250 C. In order to form the loaded latex composition of the present invention, the hydrophobe is dissolved in a water miscible organic solvent. Useful solvents are those which a can be dissolved 3n water at 20 C to the extent of at least 20 parts by volume of solvent in 80 parts by volume of water b have boiling points at atmospheric pressure above about 10 C c do not detrimentally react chemically or physically with latex polymer or the hydrophobe and d do not dissolve more than about 5 weight percent of loaded polymer particles at 200 C. Useful water miscible organic solvents are water miscible alcohols, ketones and amides, tetrahydrofuran, n methyl 2 pyrrolidone, dimethylsulfoxide, and mixtures thereof. Illustrative examples of these solvents include acetone, ethyl alcohol, methyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, dimethylformamide, methyl ethyl ketone and the like. The preferred process for loading the hydrophobe into onto the latex polymer particles is as follows. First, a solution of the hydrophobe is frmed by dissolving the hydrophobe in a auitable water miscible organic solvent. Second, a latex is formed by dispersing the polyurethane polymer particles in an aqueous continuous phase. Third, the latex is blended with the solution of the hydrophobe. Finally, the polyurethane polymer particles in the continuous phase are further loaded with the hydrophobe by removing the organic solvent. After the solution of the hydrophobe and the dispersion of the loadable polyurethane polymer particles are formed, the two are blended. Generally, it is preferred to blend the water miscible organic solvent solution into the dispersion of the loadable polyurethane polymer particles however, any order of addition can Me used. Blending is undertaken so that the hydrophobe remains in solution and the loadable polyurethane polymer particles remain dispersed.While some loading of the hydrophobe takes place upon blending, it is preferred to load the hydrophobe into the polymer particles further by removing at least a major portion of the water miscible organic solyent. The weight ratio of the polymer particles to the hydrophobe in the composition of the present invention can vary over a wide range. A useful range of the weight ratio of the polymer particles to hydrophobe is between 0.5 and 20 1. Particularly desirable compositions are formed when this ratio is between 1 1 and 10 1. Loading the hydrophobic compounds into the latex particles by the preferred method has been described in detail. It will be understood, however, that other methods can be used. For example, the hydrophobe and the latex polyurethane polymer can be chosen so that the hydrophobe is soluble in the monomers or prepolymer which is used to form the polyurethane latex. Chain extending the prepolymer with the hydrophobe dissolved therein produces a loaded polyurethane latex within the scope of the present 1nventlon. The weight percent solisss in the latex compositions of the present invention vary widely.By solids in this context, it is meant the dispersed hydrophobic polymer particles including the loaded hydrophobe. A useful range for the weight percent solids in the composition is between 5.0 percent and 40 percent based on the total weight of the composition. Surfactants are optionally used both in the preparation of the loadable latices and in the final loaded composition. Surfactants are useful in emulsifying the prepolymers used to prepare the loadable polyurethane latices and in stabilizing the loadable latices prior to and after loading. In many instances, particularly where cationically or anionically stabilized latices are used, surfactants are not necessary. Where they are used, they are typically used in a small amount such as 0,1 to 5 percent by weight of the composition. The particular surfactant depends on the particular latex and hydrophobe and is optionally anionic, cationic, nonionic or hybrid anionic nonionic.Useful surfactants include polyethylene glycol ethers of long chain diols, quaternary ammonium salts, the tertiary amine or alkylol amine salts of long chain alkyl and sulfate esters, alkyl sulfonic acids or alkylaryl sulfonic acids and salts, alkali metal salts of high molecular weight organie acids, and the like. Particularly preferred are the nonionic surfactants such as the polyoxyethylene and poly propylene glycols and the nonylphenoxypolyethyleneoxy ethanols. These nonionic surfactants are commercially available. The loaded latex coating compositions of the present invention are typically used as coating compositions to o r layers on a support. However, the loaded latex compositions of the present invention can be used as aqueous carriers for the hydrophobe.For example, where the hydrophobe is an insecticide or a herbicide, the latex composition of the present invention is usually sprayed on plants. h polyurethane latex dispersion is particularly useful in loading highly hydrophobic compounds.These compounds typically form saturated water solutions which are less than 0.1 percent by weight of the hydrophobe at 250 C. Useful hydrophobes are those which dissolve in a liquid consisting of one or a mixture of water miscible organic solvents. Preferably, the hydrophobe is soluble in a concentration of at least 5 percent by weight based on the total weight of watermiscible organic solvent and the dissolved hydrophobe.The hydrophobe and water miscible organic solvent or solvents are chose so that additional materials such as pH or other modifiers are not required to dissolve the hydrophobe. The water miscible organic solvent solutions of the hydrophobe optionally, however, contain minor amounts of diluent materials such as minor amounts of water commonly entrained in watermiscible organic solvents. Useful hydrophobic compounds which are loadable into the polyurethane latices according to the present invention are described in Research Disclosure, Vol. 159, item 15930, cited above. More particularly, the useful hydrophobes are described on pages 67 69 of that Research Disclosure. Many of the described hydrophobes are highly hydrophobic in that they form saturated water solutions which are less than 0.1 percent by weight hydrophobe. One particularly preferred class of hydrophobic compounds consists of polyanilines whose salts form semi conductors. Layers coated from compositions in which the polyanilines are loaded onto cationically stabilized polyurethane latices and actidified to form semiconductors exhibit good conductivity. The coating compositions of the present in ventlon optionally contain, in addition to the surfactants described above, thickening agents, preservatives, other latex dispersions and the like. Forexample, a W absorber loaded polyurethane latex according to the present invention optionally can be blended with a conventional latex such as a house paint. The UV absorber from the latex of the present invention will provide UV protection to a layer coated from such a blend. Other hydrophobes can function as optical brighteners and the like. The loaded latices of the present invention are useful whenever it is desired to include a hydrophobic compound, particularly one which is highly hydrophobic, in an aqueous coating composition. The coating compositions of the invention can be coated on any support. For example, where the hydrophobe is an insecticide or herbicide, the composition is coated on plants where the hydrophobe is a UV absorber, the composition optionally is included in a paint or other composition which can be coated on wood, aluminum, steel, natural and synthetic cloth, and the like. Photographic addenda are particularly preferred hydrophobes and coating compositions containing these addenda optionally are coated on photographic supports such as cellulose acetate film, poly ethylene terephthalate film, paper, polyethylene coated paper and the like. The coating compositions of the invention can be coated by means well known in the art including spraying, dipping, slide hopper coating, spin coating and the like. Further details regarding the process of loading polymer latex particles and the use of loaded latices so produced, particularly for use on photographic elements, are found In the above cited ResearchDisclosure, Vol. 159, item 15930. The entire disclosure of this Research Disclosure is hereby incorporated by reference. It will be understood that, throughout this specification where the terms latex , water miscible organic solvent , hydrophobe , surfactant and the like have been used, homogeneous or heterogeneous components have been intended. Thus, in some cases it is desirable to use a mixture oftwo or more different water miscible organic solvents to dissolve a particular hydrophobe, or it is desirable to load various combinations of differnet hydrophobes. Similarly, a blend of two or more different polyurethane latices or a blend of a polyurethane latex with a vinyl polymer latex can be loaded. Other combinations and variations will be apparent. The following preparations illustrate anionic neutral and cationic polyurethane latices which are used in the examples which follow.Preparation 1 Anionic polyurethane latex In a three necked, one liter flask equipped with an air drawn stirrer, a reflux condenser and a nitrogen inlet, were added 150 g of Pluracol P2010T04 a poly propylene glycol diol, MW 2000, sold by BASFWyandotte 50 g of Niax PPG 2025TM a poly propylene glycol diol, MW 2000, sold by Union Carbide and 13.4 g of 2,2 bis hydroxymethyl propionic acid.

For example, 5 15 indicates that the dispersion contained 5 weight percent hydrophobe and 15 weight percent polymer based on the total weight of the latex dispersion.

Note that hydrophobes having some solubility t butylhydroquinone a 0.5 weight percent in water for a saturated solution are relatively stable in all latices tested. However, as the solubility of the hydrophobe decreases, the advantages in the stability of the polyurethane latices, partic ularly those made from caprolactone, become more apparent.
