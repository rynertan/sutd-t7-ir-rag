# Apparatus for disintegrating calculus by underwater shock wave from outside human body.

## Abstract
There is disclosed an apparatus for disintegrating a calculus 10 by underwater shock wave from outside a human body 8 of the type that there are provided a shock wave generation chamber 1 of which an inner surface is formed into a shape of a part of a pseudo ellipsoid of revolution and which is filled with liquid 4 , and a shock wave generation source 2 for generating shock wave at a first focus f1 of the pseudo ellipsoid of revolution so that a calculus 10 in a human body 8 set at a second focus f2 of the pseudo ellipsoid of revolution may be disintegrated by the generated shock wave. For an easy handling there is provided a flexible container 3 containing the liquid 4 , and the shock wave generation chamber 1 is so positioned that the interior of the chamber 1 may be filled, through an open portion thereof, with the liquid 4 in the foregoing container 3 .
