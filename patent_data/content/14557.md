# Process for precipitating metal values from organic media.

## Abstract
Metal values, such as iron, may be stripped from an organic liquid medium loaded with metal ions by a process which comprises contacting the organic medium with an aqueous phase at a contact temperature which is sufficiently high to cause the metal values to precipitate as metal oxide, hydroxide or hydrate or a mixture thereof in the presence of the organic medium.
