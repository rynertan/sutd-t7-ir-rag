## Abstract
Process for the preparation of polymers of conjugated dienes and optionally monoalkenyl aromatic hydrocarbons by polymerization of conjugated diene and optionally mon oalkenyl aromatic hydrocarbon monomers in the presence of a hydrocarbon diluent, a hydrocarbyl alkali metal com pound and a Lewis base having the formula
