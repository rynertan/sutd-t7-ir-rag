# A refrigerant compressor with mechanism for adjusting the capacity of the compressor.

## Abstract
A reciprocating piston type refrigerant compressor 1 is disclosed which includes a compressor housing 10 having a cylinder block 101 provided with a plurality of cylinders 23 and a crank chamber 13 adjacent the cylinder block 101 . A piston 21 slides within each cylinder 23 and is reciprocated by a wobble plate 17 driven by a cam rotor 14 . A drive shaft 12 is connected to the cam rotor 14 to drive the cam rotor. A front end plate 11 is disposed on an opening of the crank chamber 13 the front end plate 11 rotatably supports the drive shaft 12 . A rear end plate 25 is fixed on the opposite end of the compressor housing 10 together with a valve plate 24 which includes a suction chamber 35 and a discharge chamber 36 . The rear end plate 25 is provided with a plurality of dead space chambers 42 , each of which is connected with one of the cylinders 23 through a hole 44 formed through the valve plate 24 . A valve 45 is slidably disposed within the dead space chamber 42 to control the opening and closing of the hole 44 in the valve plate 24 . The valve 45 is controlled by a valve control device 51, 53, 54, 55 supported by the rear end plate 25 . The valve control device is responsive to the environment to adjust the capacity of the compressor 1 by controlling the operation of the valves 45 .
