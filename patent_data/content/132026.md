## Description
ANTIBACTERIAL CYCLIC ETHERS OF 9 DEOXO 9a AZA 9a HOMOERYTHROMYCIN A AND INTERMEDIATES THEREFOR This invention relates to novel derivatives of 9deoxo 9a aza 9a homoerythromycin A and of its 4 epimer useful as antibacterial agents, to intermediates therefor, and to processes for preparation of said derivatives and said intermediates. More particularly it relates to cyclic ether derivatives of 9 deoxo 9a aza 9a homoerythromycin A and of its 4 epimer, to pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof and the use of said compounds as antibacterial agents, to intermediates therefor, and to processes for their preparation. Erythromycin A is a macrolide antibiotic produced by fermentation and described in U.S. Patent No.2,653,899. Numerous derivatives of erythromycin A have been prepared in efforts to modify its biological and or pharmacodynamic properties. Erythromycin A esters with mono and dicarboxylic acids are reported in Antibiotics Annual, 1953 1954, Proc. SymposiumAntibiotics Washington, D.C. , pages 500 513 and 514 521, respectively. U.S Patent No. 3,417,077 describes the cyclic carbonate ester of erythromycin A, the reaction product of erythromycin A and ethylene carbonate, as an active antibacterial agent. U.S. Patent 4,328,334, issued May 4, 1982 describes 9 deoxo 9a aza 9a homoerythromycin A and refers to it by the name ll aza 10 deoxo 10 dihydroerythromycin A.Since said compound is a ring expanded homo derivative of erythromycin A, nitrogen aza being the additional atom of the ring system, the nomenclature 9 deoxo 9aaza 9a homoerythromycin A is preferred for the parent ring system of the compounds of this invention. Belgian Patent 892,357, published July 1, 1982, and its British counterpart, Application 2,094,293A, published September 15, 1982, disclose the N methyl derivative of 9 deoxo 9a aza 9a homoerythromycin A, as does my copending U.S. application Serial No. 441,981, filed November 15, 1982, which claims priority fromU.S. application Serial No. 399,401, filed July 19, 1982. The 4 epimer of said N methyl derivative is the subject of my copending U.S. application SerialNo. 441,979, filed November 15, 1982. U.S. Patent 4,382,085, issued May 3, 1983 describes 4 epi erythromycin A i.e., the 4 OH group has the axial configuration. The 4 OH in erythromycin A has the equatorial configuration. It has now been found that certain cyclic ethers of 9 deoxo 9a aza 9a homoerythromycin A and of its 4 epimer are effective antibacterial agents againstGram positive and Gram negative bacteria. The compounds have the formula I EMI3.1 wherein n is 1, 2 or 3 and the wavy line at the 4 position is generic to and embracive of both epimer forms, provided that when n is 1, the 4 hydroxy group possesses the equatorial configuration. When n is 2 or 3, the epimeric forms of said compound differ structurally only in the configuration of the chiral center at the 4 position i.e., the 4 OH group is either axial or equatorial. The axial configuration is represented by a solid or wedged shape line and the equatorial by a broken line of attachment of the OH group to the 4 position.The terms axial and equatorial as used herein refer to the two possible chiral epimers at C 4 with respect to the 4 hydroxyl and hydrogen. Also included in this invention, and useful for the same purpose as formula I compounds, are the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof. Included among said salts, but by no means limited to said salts, are those enumerated below hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulfate, phosphate, formate, acetate, propionate, butyrate, citrate, glycolate, lactate, tartrate, malate, maleate, fumarate, gluconate, stearate, mandelate, pamoate, benzoate, succinate, lactate, p toluenesulfonate and aspartate. The present invention also embraces processes and intermediates useful for the preparation of compounds of formula I . The intermediates are represented by formulae II1 and III below EMI4.1 wherein R is CH2 pCN or CH2 mNH2 p is 1 or 2 and m is 2 or 3 and EMI5.1 wherein the wavy line at the 4 position of each of formulae II and III represents both epimers i.e., the axial and equatorial configurations, at said position. Also included in this invention are the compounds of formula V which are formed as by products in preparation of formula I compounds wherein n is 3 EMI6.1 wherein the wavy line at the 4 OH group represents the axial and equatorial configurations at said position. Compounds of formulae I , II and IV and pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof are effective antibacterial agents againstGram positive microorganisms, e.g. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, and against Gramnegative microorganisms, e.g. Pasturella multocida andNeisseria sicca in vitro. Additionally, compounds of formula I exhibit significant activity againstNeisseria gonorrhea and Haemophilus in vitro and against many Gram positive and Gram negative microorganisms in vivo. In their oral anti infective activity the formula I compounds are like 9 deoxo 9a methyl 9a aza 9a homoerythromycin A, and quite unlike the corresponding 9a desmethyl compound 9 deoxo9a aza 9a homoerythromycin A which exhibits no practical oral activity in vivo. The compounds of formula I wherein n is 3 are prepared by cyanoethylation of the appropriate 9 deoxo 9a aza 9a homoerythromycin A epimers. An excess of acrylonitrile serves as both reactant and solvent.The reaction is generally carried out at the reflux temperature of the acrylonitrile solvent, about 770C until reaction is complete. Lower temperatures, e.g.500C can be used but are avoided because of the longer reaction periods required. Higher temperatures can be used by using a solvent other than excess acrylonitrile and which is reaction inert i.e., does not enter into reaction with reactants and or products so as to adversely affect the yield of the desired cyanoethyl derivative. A reaction inert solvent can, of course, be used at whatever temperature the reaction is run. Suitable solvents are C14 alcohols, ether cyclic and acylic such as dioxan, tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether, diethylene glycol, dimethyl ether, aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene and xylene.However, the preferred method comprises the use of excess acrylonitrile as solvent. The progress of the reaction is monitored by thin layer chromatography TLC on silica gel plates and elution thereof with CH2C12 CH3OH concentrated NH 4OH 6 1 0.1 and development of the plates with a spray of vanillin ethanol H3PO4 and heat. The product is recovered by evaporation of the solvent as an off white foam. It can be, and for convenience is, used directly in the next step of the process as is. TLC indicates the product is principally the desired monocyanoethylated product. Trace amounts of more polar products were detected on TLC. The 9a cyanoethyl derivative II thus produced is converted to the corresponding 9a gamma aminopropyl derivative II by means of hydrogenation overRaney nickel according to the procedure described herein. It is converted to the corresponding 7 membered ring cyclic ether by reaction of at least stoichiometric amounts of each of isoamyl nitrite and glacial acetic acid according to the procedure described herein. The compound of formula IV , the corresponding 9a gamma acetoxypropyl derivative is produced as byproduct. The formula I compounds wherein n is 2 are prepared by alkylation of the appropriate 4 OH epimer of 9 deoxo 9 aza 9a hydtoxy 9a homoerythro mycin A 3o N oxide in a reaction inert solvent with preferably an excess of bromoacetonitrile at from 200C to 1000C and preferably at room temperature. Suitable solvents are chlorinated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, chloroform, aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene, ethers such as diethylene glycol dimethyl ether, dioxan, tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether. The reaction is carried out in the presence of an acid acceptor, e.g. an organic base such as a C14 trialkylamine, pyridine or an inorganic base such as an alkali metal carbonate or bicarbonate. The acid acceptor is used in equimolar proportion to the bromoacetonitrile which is generally used in excess to ensure optimum conversion of the macrolide reactant to product. Catalytic hydrogenation of III over Pd C in a reaction inert solvent such as ethanol achieves removal of the 9a and 3 oxide groups to yield the cyanomethyl compound of formula II wherein p is 1. The 9a cyanomethyl derivative formula 11 thus produced is reduced to the corresponding 9a betaaminoethyl derivative II by means of sodium borohydride in the presence of cobaltous chloride in hydroxylic or non hydroxylic solvents at room temperature. Molar ratios of CoC12 to NaBH4 of about 1 5 are favored for this reduction. In practice an excess ofNaBH4 is used e.g. up to 10 moles of NaBH4 per mole of substrate. Reaction of the 9a beta aminoethyl derivative with at least stoichiometric amounts of each of isoamylnitrite glacial acetic acid affords the corresponding 6 membered ring cyclic ether. The 5 membered ring cyclic ether of formula I n 1, 4 OH equatorial configuration is prepared by reacting 9 deoxo 9a aza 9a homoerythromycin A with from 1 4 equivalents each of formaldehyde, conveniently as 37 aqueous solution, and formic acid, in a reactioninert solvent, preferably at ambient temperature.Representative solvents are halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, chloroform and carbon tetrachloride. The critical feature of the reaction is the use of relatively low reaction temperature. The reaction is readily conducted from about 150C to 30 C, preferably from 20 C 25 C. The reaction, if conducted at elevated temperatures, e.g. reflux temperature, affords the 9amethyl derivative i.e., reductive methylation occurs.At elevated temperatures, e.g. above about 500C, methylation occurs exclusively. However, under the conditions of the present process cyclic ether formation occurs between the llbeta OH and the 9a aza groups. Compounds of formulae II , III and IV and of formula II wherein R1 is CH2 pCN wherein the 2 and or 4 hydroxy groups are acylated to give corresponding C23 alkanoyl derivatives are conveniently prepared by standard acylation procedures such as those described by Jones et al., J. Med. Chem. 15, 631 1972 , and by Banaszek et al., Rocy. Chem. 43, 763 1969 . The 2 and 4 hydroxy groups are acylated by means of the appropriate acid anhydride e.g. R2CO 2O in pyridine. Solvolysis of the 2 ,4 ester with methanol produces the 4 ester. Formation of mixed esters, e.g. 2 acetyl 4 propionyl , is readily achieved by acylating the 4 ester R3 propionyl with acetic anhydride in a reaction inert solvent in the presence of potassium carbonate according to the procedure for mixed esters described by Jones et al. loc. cuit. . Acid addition salts of the compounds of this invention are readily prepared by treating compounds having formulae I IV with at least an equimolar amount of the appropriate acid in a reaction inert solvent or, in the case of the hydrochloride salts, with pyridinium hydrochloride. Since more than one basic group is present in a compound of formula I or II, the addition of sufficient acid to satisfy each basic group permits formation of polyacid addition salts. When preparing acid addition salts of formulae I IV compounds wherein the 2 OH is acylated, isopropanol is used as solvent to avoid solvolysis of the alkanoyl group. The acid addition salts are recovered by filtration if they are insoluble in the reaction inert solvent, by precipitation by addition of a non solvent for the acid addition salt, or by evaporation of the solvent. A variety of gram positive microorganisms and certain gram negative microorganisms, such as those of spherical or ellipsoidal shape cocci , are susceptible to compounds of formulae I , II and IV . Their in vitro activity is readily demonstrated by in vitro tests against various microorganisms in a brain heart infusion medium by the usual two fold serial dilution technique. Their in vitro activity renders them useful for topical application in the form of ointments, creams and the like, for sterilization purposes, e.g. sick room utensils and as industrial antimicrobials, for example, in water treatment, slime control, paint and wood preservation. For in vitro use, e.g. for topical. application, it will often be convenient to compound the selected product by methods well known in the pharmacist s art into lotions, salves, ointments, creams, gels or the like. For such purposes, it will generally be acceptable to employ concentrations of active ingredient of from about 0.01 percent up to about 10 percent by weight based on total composition. The dosage form is applied at the site of infection ad libitum, generally at least once a day. Additionally, formula I compounds of this invention are active versus Gram positive and certainGram negative microorganisms in vivo via the oral and or parenteral routes of administration in animals, including man. Their in vivo activity is more limited as regards susceptible organisms and is determined by the usual procedure which comprises infecting mice of substantially uniform weight with the test organism and subsequently treating them orally or subcutaneously with the test compound. In practice, the mice, e.g.10, are given an intraperitoneal inoculation of suitably diluted cultures containing approximately 1 to 10 times the LDl00 the lowest concentration of organisms required to produce 100 deaths . Control tests are simultaneously run in which mice receive inoculum of lower dilutions as a check on possible variation in virulence of the test organism. The test compound is administered 0.5 hour post inoculation, and is repeated 4, 24 and 48 hours later. Surviving mice are held for 4 days after the last treatment and the number of survivors is noted. When used in vivo, these novel compounds can be administered orally or parenterally, e.g. by subcutaneous or intramuscular injection, at a dosage of from about 1 mg kg to about 200 mg kg of body weight per day. The favored dosage range is from about 5 mg kg to about 100 mg kg of body weight per day and the preferred range from about 5 mg kg to about 50 mg kg of body weight per day. Vehicles suitable for parenteral injection may be either aqueous such as water, isotonic saline, isotonic dextrose, Ringer s solution or non aqueous such as fatty oils of vegetable origin cotton seed, peanut oil, corn, sesame , dimethylsulfoxide and other non aqueous vehicles which will not interfere with therapeutic efficiency of the preparation and are non toxic in the volume or proportion used glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol .Additionally, compositions suitable for extemporaneous preparation of solutions prior to administration may advantageously be made. Such compositions may include liquid diluents for example, propylene glycol, diethyl carbonate, glycerol, sorbitol, etc. buffering agents, hyaluronidase, local anesthetics and inorganic salts to afford desirable pharmacological properties.These compounds may also be combined with various pharmaceutically acceptable inert carriers including solid diluents, aqueous vehicles, non toxic organic solvents in the form of capsules, tablets, lozenges, troches, dry mixes, suspensions, solutions, elixirs and parenteral solutions or suspensions. In general, the compounds are used in various dosage forms at concentration levels ranging from about 0.5 percent to about 90 percent by weight of the total composition. In the examples presented herein, no effort was made to recover the maximum amount of product produced or to optimize the yield of a given product. TheExamples are merely illustrative of the process and of the products obtainable thereby. In all examples, the terms vanillin ethanol H3pO4 spray and 1,vanillin H3PO4 spray refer to a solution of 1.0 g of vanillin, 100 ml of ethanol and 100 ml ofH3PO4.
