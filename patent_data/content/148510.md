# HIGH CONDUCTANCE CIRCUIT FOR PROGAMMABLE INTEGRATED CIRCUIT

## Abstract
A unique programming means, suitable for use with programmable read only memories PROM , or other cir cuits utilizing programmable fuses, is provided which over comes several distinct disadvantages of prior art pro gramming means. The program means of this invention in cludes a Darlington pair of prgramming transistors which allows only a single programming transistor to be made large in order to carry the large programming current, and only a single high current drive signal need be applied to the single programming transistor, thereby minimizing power consumption and integrated circuit die area.
