# Method for sleeving a tube.

## Abstract
A hollow tubular member insert or blank which is to serve as a sleeve for a corroded tube of the steam generator of a nuclear reactor plant and which is too long to be manipulated under the tube sheet of the reactor, is prebent into a shape such that it can be manipulated and is then progressively straightened under the tube sheet as it is progressively inserted into the tube. The straightener in cludes a plurality of grooved rolls mounted staggered and roratable by a gear train. Each roll has a channel shaped periphery engaging half of the periphery of the tubular member. The contour of the engaging surface of each roll is the same as the contour of the member over half of its peripheral surface so that each roll mates with the member over half of its peripheral surface. The rolls are in frictional engagement with the member and advance the member whilst bending it so that the material of the member is stressed beyond its elastic limit sufficiently to straighten the hollow member. The grooved rolls are each driven by an associated gear, all gears being driven in a train, the gear train being driven by a motor.
