# Method of producing permanent magnet.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a method of producing a permanent magnet in which a material containing ferromagnetic powder is molded into a columnar or cylindrical molded body through injection molding, compression molding, or the like, in a magnetic field capable of orientating and magnetizing the ferromagnetic powder. The method comprises the steps of applying a magnetic field to the molded body in the unidirection perpendicular to an axis of rotation of the molded body to orientate and magnetize the molded body so as to have two magnetic poles of N and S demagnetizing the magnetized molded body and divisionally remagnetizing the demagnetized molded body on its outer or inner surface to form at least two stripes of N and S poles arranged alternately and extending parallelly to the axis of rotation of the molded body.
