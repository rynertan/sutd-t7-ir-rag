# Sterilizing treatment with hydrogen peroxide and neutralization of residual amounts thereof.

## Abstract
Surfaces and articles or devices sterilized with an aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution are treated with an aqueous solution comprising a sufficient amount of sodium pyruvate to decompose the hydrogen peroxide. The invention includes a method and sterilization system which is particularly useful in medical applica tions. Hydrophilic contact lenses may be conveniently sterilized with a hydrogen peroxide solution and rendered non irritating to the eyes by treating the sterilized lenses with a sterile, sodium pyruvate solution which decomposes any hydrogen peroxide remaining with the lenses.
