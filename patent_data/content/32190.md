# Apparatus for measuring radiation emitted by a sample.

## Abstract
In a spectrofluorimeter, comprising an excitation monochromator 18 and an emission monochromator 38 , ellipsoidal reflectors 30 34 are provided for focussing radiation to and from the sample cell 12 . Baffles 50 52 are also provided on respectively excitation and emission beams. Sample cell 12 is formed of a section of quartz tubing with chamfered ends 64 66 and is clamped through tubular seals 73, 74 by tubular mounts 60, 62 . One mount is carried by a base 80 , the other one by an arm 86 , arm and base being coupled for pivotal movement one relative to the other. The pivotal coupling includes a pair of elements 100, 102 on the pivotal axis and cooperable surfaces on arm and base.
