# Magnetic bubble cassette.

## Abstract
A magnetic bubble cassette C including a casing 1,2 containing a magnetic bubble device 38 and a connector 7 and provided with a cover 3 that is mounted on a support pin 9 on the end of the casing for pivotal movement between open and closed positions. In the open position of the cover, the cassette connector 7 is exposed and can be connected to another connector 14 provided in a cassette holder H in which the magnetic bubble cassette is inserted. Members 12, 13 in the holder cooperate with pawls 6 on the cover to open the cover automatically as the cassette is inserted into the holder. The cassette connector is thus protected when the cassette is out of the holder and during insertion into the holder. A further pawl 23 in the holder enters a recess 24 in the cassette casing to lock the cassette into the holder and can be released by an unlocking push button 61 .
