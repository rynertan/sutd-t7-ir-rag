# Process for coating a substrate and a liquid aqueous coating composition to be used therein.

## Abstract
A process is provided for coating a substrate by applying to a substrate an aqueous coating composition that comprises a an aqueous dispersion of a film form ing polymer having a minimum film forming temperature not higher than 45 C b a solid, particulate polymer having a softening temperature in the range of 45 C to 260 C and an average particle size in the range of 2 to 400 µm and c a solid, rubberlike polymer having an average particule size in the range of 1 to 500 µm, the resulting coating being cured at a temperature of 70 260 C. The invention also relates to the liquid aqueous coating composition to be used in said process.
