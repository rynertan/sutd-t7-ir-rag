## Description
The invention relates to a system for displaying motion pictures, still pictures and character data on a plural number of terminal display units. From DE A 3 116 422, a digital transmission system is known which comprises a signal processing unit for multiplexing digital signals with motion picture data and other data a network for transmitting said digital signals thus multiplexed and a plurality of display units each of which receives some of said digital data to display motion pictures and other data on a single display screen. Other examples of conventional display systems are shown in Figs. 1 and 2 of the accompanying drawings. In Fig. 1, reference numeral 1 designates a video signal line 2, a character generator 3, a character signal superposing unit 4, a modulator 5, an RF signal line 6, distributors and 7, television sets. In Fig. 2, reference numeral 11 designates a computer 12, a line controlling unit 13, a telephone exchange 14, telephone lines and 15, terminal display units. The system as shown in Fig. 1 operates as follows the video signal 1 and a signal outputted by the character generator 2 are multiplexed in an analog mode by the character signal superposing unit 3 and applied as an RF signal to the signal line 5 by the modulator 4. The RF signal thus applied is delivered through the distributors 6 to the television sets, in response to which motion pictures or character data can be selectively displayed on the terminal units television sets . In the system shown in Fig. 2, a number of items of data are registered in the computer 11. Of the data thus registered, data items requested from the terminal display units are transmitted through the line controlling unit 12 and the telephone exchange 13 to the terminal display units 15 so as to be displayed thereon. In the system shown in Fig. 1, it is impossible to display motion pictures and character data simultaneously, and it is also impossible to transmit a large number of data items at the same time because character data must be superposed in the blanking interval of the video signal. On the other hand, the system shown in Fig. 2 is advantageous in that large numbers of data items can be transmitted to the terminal display units however, it is still disadvantageous in that it cannot display motion pictures because it uses telephone lines for data communication. An object of the invention is to provide a digital transmission system in which digital transmission paths are provided to allow terminal display units to display motion pictures and still pictures simultaneously, and in which a large number of items of data can be transmitted. According to the invention, there is provided a digital transmission system in which motion pictures, still pictures and character data are displayed on a plurality of terminal display units comprising a signal processing unit for multiplexing digital signals with motion picture, still picture and character data a network for transmitting said digital signals thus multiplexed and a plurality of display units each of which is connected to receive said digital signal to display motion picture, still picture and character data on a single display screen, wherein said signal processing unit comprises an analog to digital converter and frame memory, said analog to digital converter being arranged to receive a composite video signal to store frames of said video signal in said frame memory and to supply data to said network a character and pattern signal generator having an output coupled to said network a central processing unit for controlling input and output of data between a main memory and said character and pattern signal generator and a signal transmission controller and a bus controller being arranged to control the flow of data to said network from said analog to digital converter, said character and pattern signal generator, and said main memory. For a better understanding of the invention, and to show how the same may be carried into effect, reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings, in which A preferred embodiment of the invention will be described with reference to Fig. 3. In Fig. 3, reference numeral 20 designates a signal processing unit 21, an A D converter and frame memory 22, a cyclic bus controller 23, a character and pattern signal generator 24, a CPU 25, a main memory 26, a disk controller 27, a hard disk 28, a cyclic bus 29, a program control channel 30, a direct memory access bus 31, a signal transmission controller 32, signal distributors 33, display units 34, a decoder 35, a command decoding and still picture and character processing unit 36, a motion picture memory 37, a still picture and character memory 38, a timing signal generator 39, an OR gate 40, a CRT drive circuit 41, a CRT and 42, a picture selecting panel. In the system thus constructed, a video signal on the line 1 is subjected to analog to digital conversion by the A D converter 21 and temporarily stored in the frame memory. The data thus stored is cyclically applied to the bus 28 in response to a command from the bus controller 22. On the other hand, character and graphic data, formed by a computer composed of the circuit elements 24,25,26,27,29 and 30, are supplied to the character and pattern signal generator 23 where they are converted into a pictorial pattern which is applied to the cyclic bus. Therefore, the signal on the cyclic bus 28 is a picture signal in which still picture pattern data from generator 23 is superposed on motion pictures which have been converted into digital data by A D converter 21. With the aid of the signal transmission controller 31, the picture signal, after being multiplexed with commands, characters, graphic codes and new pattern data delivered by the buses 29 and 30, is outputted as a digital signal. The signal thus outputted is applied to the display units 33 through the signal distributors 32. At each display unit 33, the signal applied thereto is divided into components. The motion picture data the picture signal on which the pattern data is superposed is written into the motion picture memory 36. On the other hand, in the processing unit 35, the commands, characters, graphic codes and new pattern data are processed according to the selection signal outputted by the picture selecting panel 42 with respect to the command data so that the necessary picture data is written into the memory 37. Picture data is read out of both of the memories 36 and 37 according to the timing signal provided by the timing signal generating circuit 38 and applied to the OR gate 39. The output of the OR gate 39 is applied to the CRT drive circuit 40 to drive the CRT 41. In the above described embodiment, the network is not particularly specified, and any network using coaxial cables or optical fibers may be employed so long as it can transmit digital signals. As is apparent from the above description, the system of the invention includes a signal processing unit for multiplexing digital signals with motion picture, still picture and character data, a network for transmitting the digital signals thus multiplexed, and a plurality of display units each of which can display motion picture, still picture and character data on the same screen simultaneously. Therefore, the display units can selectively display different data together with motion pictures. Thus, the system of the invention can efficiently display a variety of data.
