# CONTAINER CARRIER AND PACKAGE

## Abstract
A container package comprises a sheet of plastics material 12 having a plurality of apertures 40 and a like plurality of containers 10 respectively received in the apertures 40 . Each container 10 comprises a plastics bottle 10 having a laminated plastics and foil cover 32 heat sealed to it. Each container has a top 26, 28 with a maximum diameter and a subjacent rim portion tapering downwardly and inwardly from the maximum diameter. The cover 32 has an edge 34 on the subjacent portion. The apertures 40 in the carrier 10 are initially elongate longitudinally and are provided with scalloped margins 44 . The margins 42, 44 are of lesser circumference than the rims of the containers 10 , whereby the margins are stretched and deflected upwardly along the subjacent rim portion with the margins lying above the lower edges 34 of the cover 32 .

## Claims
1. A carrier 12 for connecting together a plurality of containers 10 each having a substantially circular upper end into a package with the containers 10 substantially abutting and in parallel rows comprising a substantially unsupported sheet of plastics material having a longitudinal dimension, being resilient, deformable and elastic and having a plurality of apertures 40 in it, each of the apertures 40 being elongate longitudinally of the carrier and having a scalloped 44 margin, the circumferential extent of each of the apertures 40 being less than that of the substantially circular upper end of the container 10 so that the margin of each of the apertures 40 must be stretched and flexed to accommodate a container.

## Description
Apertured sheet plastic carriers for containers such as cans or bottles are known in the art. The earliest of these is described in US A 2874835 in which a sheet with circular apertures is used to carry circular cans. The margins of the apertures are stretched and deflected to engage beneath the bead of the can. Carriers with generally circular apertures, having scalloped edges are described in US A 3946535 for carrying bottles with tabs formed between the scallops engaging beneath the rims or beads at the upper ends of bottle necks. Carriers with non circular apertures for use with cylindrical containers are described in US A 4219117. A narrower band of blank material can be used when apertures are elongated longitudinally of the blank band of material, and are stretched into circular configuration by mounting about cylindrical containers. Hence, there is less scrap. A common feature of such prior art plastic carriers and the well known resulting six pack of carrier and containers is that the plastic material at the margin of each aperture is stretched and turned upwardly beneath the rim or bead at the top of a container. Release of a container from the carrier is effected by pulling sideways on the desired container to stretch the material about the corresponding aperture, and then tipping the container out of the stretched encircling carrier. A new type of container is now available, comprising a wide mouthed plastics bottle having a foil and plastic lamination placed over the open mouth of the bottle, crimped over the top rim and heat sealed to it. The prior carriers described above would not be satisfactory for carrying such containers, as the stretched margins of the material of the carrier about each aperture would engage beneath the foil covering and peel it off the bottle. According to one aspect of this invention a carrier for connecting together a plurality of containers each having a substantially circular upper end into a package with the containers substantially abutting and in parallel rows comprises a substantially unsupported sheet of plastics material having a longitudinal dimension, being resilient, deformable and elastic and having a plurality of apertures in it, each of the apertures being elongate longitudinally of the carrier and having a scalloped margin, the circumferential extent of each of the apertures being less than that of the substantially circular upper end of the container so that the margin of each of the apertures must be stretched and flexed to accommodate a container. According to another aspect of this invention a container package comprises a carrier and a plurality of containers carried thereby, each of the containers having a circular upper end with an opening therein and a rim about the opening, the rim having a predetermined maximum circumference adjacent its upper end and tapering downwardly and inwardly from the maximum circumference, each container having a flexible sheet material cover overlying the opening, contacting the rim and having a depending skirt secured to the tapering portion of the rim, the skirt having a lower edge spaced from the upper end of the rim and having a predetermined circumference, the carrier comprising a sheet of plastics material which is resilient, deformable and elastic and has a plurality of apertures in it, each of the apertures having a margin with a periphery which is initially shorter than the said predetermined circumference of the lower edge of the skirt, the margin and adjacent material being stretched and located over the rim of the container, the margin and adjacent material being deflected upwards along the skirt, the margin being located above the edge of the skirt, and the material initially outward of the margin engaging the surface of the skirt. A particular example of a carrier and a package in accordance with this invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Turning now in greater particularity to the drawings, and first to Figures 1 to 4, there will be seen a plurality of containers 10 supported by a sheet plastic carrier 12. Each container 10 comprises a wide mouth plastic bottle having a bottom portion 14 tapering upwardly and outwardly at a shallow angle to a substantially right angle shoulder or step 16 at which point the bottle reaches a maximum diameter 18. From this point the bottle tapers inwardly at a shallow angle forming a body 20. At the top of the body the bottle tapers more sharply inwardly at 22 to a ring or annular concavity 24 of minimum diameter. The bottle then extends upwardly and tapers outwardly as a rim 26, finally being rolled over at 28 to a flat, open mouth top 30. Each bottle 10 has a circular cross section throughout. A top, cover or lid 32 of laminated foil and plastic surmounts each open top, and is crimped down along the tapered rim 26 to the ring 24 of minimum diameter, the cover being heat sealed to the bottle. The cooperation of the carrier 12 with the containers 10 in such manner as to avoid engaging beneath the lower margin 34 of the top cover 32, which could peel it from place will be discussed hereinafter following a description of the carrier 12 as best seen in Figure 5. The carrier 12, before assembly with the containers, is relatively elongated, and has straight, but interrupted, longitudinal sides or edges 36 resulting from formation of a succession of carriers from a blank band or strip of suitable resilient plastic material which is resilient, deformable and elastic, polyethylene being a preferred example. Preferably there is provided a long succession of interconnected carriers 12 after the fashion disclosed in US A 3946535, and assembly of the strip of carriers with the containers is similar to that disclosed in said patent. Only one carrier is shown in Figure 12, having transverse ends 38 where one carrier is severed from another. The carrier 12 is provided with six container receiving apertures 40 arranged in pairs which are symmetric about the centre line of the carrier. Each aperture 40 is elongated in the longitudinal direction of the carrier and is of generally oval or eliptical shape. Specifically, the margin of each aperture 40 is of a scalloped nature, having a plurality of alternating tabs 42 and recesses or scallops 44. Each of the tabs 42 is formed as an arc of a circle, all of the tabs being of the same radius with the exception of the tabs 42 adjacent the longitudinally opposite ends of each aperture, which are formed of slightly shorter radius than the other tabs. By way of specific example, the tabs 42 have a radius of 0.1875 inch, 4.6 mm , while all of the other tabs have a radius of 0.250 inch 6 mm . The recesses or scallops 44 are also circular arcs, and all are of the same radius except for the recesses 44 at the longitudinally opposite ends of each aperture 40, these recesses or scallops being of slightly larger radius than the others. Specifically, and on the same scale as noted heretofore, by way of example, the recesses or scallops 44 have a radius of 0.1250 inch 3 mm , while all of the other scallops or recesses have a radius of 0.0937 inch 0.23 mm . The differences in radius of the end recesses 44 as compared with the other recesses, and the similar differences in radius of the tab 42 as compared with the other tabs facilitates stretching of the apertures into circular shape with minimal stress in the material from which the carrier is formed, and producing uniform gripping of each container in a respective aperture. Each carrier 12 further is provided with a pair of finger gripping apertures 46 which are elongated transversely of the carrier and which are respectively disposed midway between successive container receiving apertures 40. The apertures 46 each comprise parallel front and rear edges 48 perpendicular to the centre line of the carrier and elongated transversely thereof. The edges 48 join to lateral end portions 50 of generally triangular shape, each of the straight edges of the apertures 46 being joined by circular arcs to minimize stress. In addition, between each pair of laterally aligned container receiving apertures 40 there is disposed a pair of generally D shaped apertures 52, comprising arcuate edges 54 generally confronting one another, and remote straight edges 56, the arcuate and straight edges being interconnected by circular arcs to avoid stress concentrations. End opening apertures or recesses 58 comprise transverse straight edges 60 and arcuate lateral edges 62 which more or less align with the end portions of the arcuate edges 54 of the D shaped apertures 52. Generally triangular recesses 64 are provided in the longitudinal edges of the carrier intermediate successive container receiving apertures 40, the edges thereof being joined to one another and to the longitudinal edges by circular arcs, again to avoid stress concentrations. Finally, rather small semi circular pin slots 66 are provided outboard of each pair of container receiving apertures 40, and respectively on the centres of the arcs forming the adjacent tabs 42. These receive pins of the assembling machine as disclosed in US A 3946535 for assembling the carrier with the containers. When the carrier is asembled with the containers in the manner disclosed in US A 3946535, pins in the assembling machine are received in the semi circular slots 66, and pull the material of the carrier outwardly away from the centre line thereof, partially to stretch the container receiving apertures 40 toward circular shape. The semi circular nature of the apertures 66 provides a curved surface for the pins to bear against, thus minimizing stress in the material of the carrier. The apertures 40 further are moved into a circular configuration as they are pressed over the tops of the containers. The provision of the D shaped apertures 52 allows the material between confronting pairs thereof to buckle as the inboard portions of the apertures 40 are forced toward circular position. The outboard portions adjacent the longitudinal edges 36 are unrestrained, and readily move toward circular position. The diameter of the upper portion of each container is greater than the periphery of each container receiving aperture 40, particularly as considered along the apices of the scallops 44 and 44 . As a result, the tabs 42 see Figure 3 are folded back along the surface of the foil plastic cover 30 so that a portion of the plastic carrier as indicated at 68 overlies the minimum diameter portion 24 of the container, with a previously inward portion adjacent the margin of the container receiving aperture being flexed upwardly and outwardly and embracing the outwardly and upwardly tapering rim of the container. A portion 72 of the carrier outwardly from the aperture 40 engages the container below the minimum diameter portion 24. It is important to note that the upper formerly inner edge 42, 44 lies entirely above the bottom margin of the foil 34, and therefore does not tend to peel the foil off the bottle. This is an important feature of the present invention and distinguishes from the prior art in which an edge or margin of an aperture and a carrier fits beneath a bead or other outward projection on a container. The shape of each container receiving aperture prior to assembly also is important in that the aperture is initially oval rather than circular, and has a scalloped margin with certain of the scallops and intervening tabs being of different size than others. When it is desired to remove a bottle or container from the package, the particular bottle is pulled laterally to stretch the encircling band of plastic material of the carrier, whereby the bottle then may be tipped out of the aperture in which it has been held.
