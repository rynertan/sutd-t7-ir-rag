# Refractory cores, production thereof and use thereof in casting of ferrous alloys.

## Abstract
The refractory cores, which have a porosity of at least 25 by volume and a modulus of rupture of at least 60 kilog rams per square centimetre, are formed from a particulate material predominantly comprising vitreous silica grains bonded together by crystalline silica formed in situ at the grain boundaries in an amount of not more than 30 by weight of the core. The cores are made from a mixture com prising an organic binder, a mineralizer and refractory parti cles at least 40 of the latter having a particle size of at least 50 microns and at least 20 of the refractory particles being vitreous silica particles of size 1 to 30 microns by shaping the mixture, firing at at least 1000 C to form crystalline silica in the amount specified above, and cooling. The cores are used for casting ferrous alloys at at least 1500 C.
