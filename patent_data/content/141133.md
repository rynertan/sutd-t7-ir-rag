# Rubber compositions and articles thereof having improved metal adhesion and metal adhesion retention.

## Abstract
Rubber compositions and articles such as tires having improved metal adhesion and metal adhesion retention to bright steel metallic reinforcement. The improvement com prises admixing from about 0.2 to about 6.0 parts per hundred rubber phr of a cobalt compound selected from the group consisting of cobalt chloride bis 8 hydroxyquinolate and cobalt bis 8 hydroxyquinolate with a vulcanizable rubber composition prior to embedding the metallic reinforcement therein and curing. A method for improving the metal adhe sion and metal adhesion retention between a vulcanizable rubber and bright steel metallic reinforcement includes the step of dispersing from about 0.2 to about 6.0 phr of a cobalt compound selected from the group consisting of cobalt chloride bis 8 hydroxyquinolate and cobalt bis 8 hydroxyquinolate in a vulcanizable rubber composition prior to curing.
