# Arrangement for combining the output signals from a plurality of transmitters tuned to the same frequency.

## Abstract
An arrangement for combining the output signals from a plurality of transmission units 2, 3 tuned to the same frequency and included in said arrangement, while each arrangement is by itself capable of functioning as a transmis sion unit 2 whose output signal can be combined with that of another transmission unit 3 . The arrangement incorpo rates for each pair of transmission units 2, 3 to be combined control circuitry 5 for generating a control signal used to combine the output signals of the pair of transmission units 2, 3 in phase. The control circuitry 5 comprises a sum and difference network 6 connected to the transmission units 2, 3 and a detector 7 , for example a phase sensitive detector, for determining said conrol signal from the output signals of the sum and difference network 6 , the sign of the control signal being of special importance.
