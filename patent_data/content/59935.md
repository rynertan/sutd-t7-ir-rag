# Non foamed thermoplastic polyurethane resin.

## Abstract
A thermoplastic polyurethan resin obtained by reacting 1 a polyol component with 2 an organic diisocyanate in a mole ratio, 1 2 , of 0.8 1.3 0.5 1.2 in the presence, if desired, of a cataylist, said polyol component 1 comprising A a linear polyester polyol and or polyether polyol having hydroxyl groups at both ends and or B a diol free from a tertiary hydroxyl group, and C a low molecular weight polyol having at least one tertiary hydroxyl group C 1 , and or a polyester polyol and or polyether polyol having a molecular weight of 500 to 6,000 and containing hydroxyl groups at both ends and at least one tertiary hydroxyl group in the molecular chain C 2 prepared from said low molecular weight polyol C 1 , the proportions of A , B and C in said polyol component 1 being such that the ratio of C to the sum of A , B and C is from 0.05 to 1.
