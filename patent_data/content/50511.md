# A SPACER FOR SUPPORTING A HEAT DETECTOR CABLE

## Abstract
A spacer 1 for supporting a heat detector cable 14 has a cable tie 15 connected to a column 2 which is integral with an element 9 to secure the spacer to a cable tray. The securing element is preferably a T shaped member extending from the column to lock into an aperture in the tray. This spacer enables simple and fast attachment and detachment with the tray, and the heat detector cable can be located either above or below the tray.
