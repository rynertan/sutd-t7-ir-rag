# Semiconductor structure comprising a mesa region, process for forming a semiconductor mesa vertical field effect transistor and method of forming a vertical semiconductor device.

## Abstract
The thickness of a conformal coating 7 over an originally formed mesa 6 is used to define a shoulder 10 in a finally formed mesa. The shoulder permits an electrode 11 to be precisely positioned at a location between the base and the top of the mesa. A vertical field effect transistor has a mesa serving as the channel region and a gate electrode positioned at a shoulder of the mesa. The stepped mesa is formed by providing a conformal coating 7 on the sides of an original mesa 6 of constant cross section, rendering the material surrounding the original mesa semi insulating, and downwardly eroding the material surrounding the original mesa using the confor mal coating as a mask to form a final mesa consisting of an upper part which was the original mesa and a lower part of greater cross section than the upper part.

## Description
SEMICONDUCTOR STRUCTURE COMPRISING A MESA REGION, PROCESS FOR FORMING A SEMICONDUCTOR MESA VERTICAL FIELD EFFECT TRANSISTOR AND METHOD OF FORMING A VERTICAL SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE This invention relates to a semiconductor structure comprising a mesa region, process for forming a semiconductor mesa vertical field effect transistor and method of forming a vertical semiconductor device. In general in this field, the smaller the device dimensions of a semiconductor device the greater the speed with which the device can operate. As extremely highspeed semiconductor devices are sought, the particularly small dimensions required are generally beyond the resolution of the standard photolithographic techniques currently used in the art. One particular device structure is the field effect transistor wherein the source, the drain and the gate contacts are in line on the surface of the substrate and the distance between the source and drain electrodes thereof is being reduced to the range of around a half micron which is beyond the readily reproducible range of processing. There have been approaches in the art to achieve the needed small dimensions indirectly. One approach that has been applied to the field effect type of transistor is through the use of the edge of a metal layer as the gate electrode. A typical such device is shown in the 1980IEDM Technical Digest, Volume 24, No. 1, page 608, known as the permeable base transistor. This structure, however, as may be seen from the description requires great care to fabricate and the resulting structure has a high gate capacitance which introduces circuit limitations. How the invention can be carried out will now be described by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which FIGS. 1 to 9 illustrate successive stages in the fabrication of a vertical field effect transistor in accordance with the invention. The invention seeks to provide a semiconductor structure which is an improvement over the prior art. According to one aspect of the invention, a semiconductor structure comprising a mesa region epitaxial to and extending from a substantially planar portion, is characterised by the mesa having a step therein so that the lower part of the mesa has a greater cross section than the upper part of the mesa. According to another aspect of the invention, a process for forming a semiconductor mesa with a lower part having a greater cross section than the upper part of the mesa, comprises forming an original mesa of constant cross section, providing a conformal coating on the sides of the original mesa, downwardly eroding the material surrounding the original mesa using the conformal coating as a mask to form a final mesa consisting of an upper part which was the original mesa and a lower part of greater cross section than the upper part. In practicing the invention, a thin coating is deposited on the side of a mesa. A vertical erosion step using the coating as a mask produces a horizontal shoulder on the mesa which in turn is usable for vertical positioning. It will be assumed that the surface of a substrate is horizontal.A mesa is first formed on the substrate. The mesa is to serve as at least a portion of a device to be fabricated. The horizontal dimensions are established using the edge of a precisely deposited resist and a perpendicular erosion or etching operation. Since the erosion is perpendicular to the surface, horizontal accuracy results. Accuracy in the direction perpendicular to the substrate is controlled by the etching or erosion which are very precise operations. A conformal coating is next placed over the surface of the substrate and over both the top and sides of the mesa. The coating is such that the portion on the horizontal surfaces is removable without significant removal of the portion on the sides of the mesa.The edge of the coating on the sides of the mesa is next used to control the horizontal extent of a perpendicular processing step that changes the characteristics of the substrate around the mesa so that the mesa now has a shoulder at the surface. An erosion step is next performed that removes the substrate surrounding the shoulder so that the mesa is elongated with the shoulder as a reference location at an intermediate position in the length. The coating on the sides of the mesa may now be removed and the shoulder and the relation thereof to the surface of the substrate and the ends of the mesa may be used for locating purposes in further processing. The invention is illustrated in connection with the production of a vertical field effect transistor wherein the source to drain electrodes are separated by a mesa channel region having a shoulder to which is abutted a gate electrode. The field effect transistor structure is made by forming a mesa on a substrate with a height of the order of the channel length, placing thereover a conformal coating, removing the conformal coating except for the sides of the mesa, converting the area around the mesa to device isolating type material thereby establishing a shoulder on the mesa at the substrate surface, removing the insulating material around the mesa to a depth to expose a portion of the sides, applying a gate metal coating over the semi insulating material and the exposed sides of the mesa, and removing the metal coating between the gate and drain contacts by a lift off technique by dissolving the remains of the conformal coating. The technique of the invention results in an epitaxial mesa with a shoulder between the extremities thereof. The technique of the invention is illustrated in the accompanying drawings as applied to a field effect transistor and provides a vertical channel region through the use of the edge of a conformal coating applied to the sides of a mesa and the use of further eroding processing to produce a shoulder which serves for positioning of the gate contacts. Referring to FIG. 1, a substrate 1 which may be associated with a single device or an array of devices is shown having a high conductivity lower region 2 and a device region 3 of moderate conductivity, each region having an alloyed metal ohmic contact 4 and 5. For purposes of simplicity of explanation for the field effect device preferred embodiment, the semiconductor material will be arbitrarily chosen as GaAs and the conductivity type will be chosen as n, although it will be apparent to one skilled in the art in the light of the principles set forth that other semiconductors and the other conductivity type may be employed. Referring next to FIG. 2, the horizontal dimensions, one of which is labelled W, of a mesa 6 are produced by fine line lithography. Since the FET device will need an ohmic drain contact at the top of the mesa to be fabricated, metal layer 4 is first applied to the substrate. Fine line lithography followed by an ion milling operation to a depth H1 produces the structure shown in FIG. 2. A contact 5 will serve as the source of the FET device. The dimension W, the width of the channel, should be of the order of 0.1 to 0.5 microns, with the H1 dimension being provided by the ion milling operation to a depth of about 0.35 microns. In FIG. 3, a conformal coating 7 is deposited over the surface of the substrate and over the top and sides of the mesa 6. The coating may be applied by a conventional even coating process such as chemical vapor deposition, vacuum deposition and sputtering. The material employed for the coating is such that it may be removed from the horizontal areas without significant removal from the sides of the mesa. Some materials have a degree of anisotropy in etching such that the etching proceeds faster in the vertical direction and hence the material on the horizontal surfaces would be removed more rapidly. The materials SiO2 and Si3N4 can exhibit etching anisotropy in plasma or reactive ion etching. The thickness of the coating 7 on the sides of the mesa 6 will determine the dimension of a shoulder. A coating 0.02 to 0.1 microns thick is satisfactory. Referring next to FIG. 4, the conformal coating 7 is etched away from all horizontal surfaces leaving portions of the conformal coating 7 on the sides of the mesa 6 surrounded by the exposed surface 8 of the substrate 1. In FIG. 5, a portion of the region 3 surrounding the mesa 6 is altered in characteristics in a vertically oriented step using the combination of the mesa and the remaining portions of the conformal coating 7 as a mask. The upper part of region 3 is converted to semi insulating material 9 using a technique such as proton bombardment or oxygen implantation through the surface 8. Since the conversion by bombardment or implantation occurs in a direction perpendicular to the substrate, a shoulder 10 is protected by the lower edge of the remains of the conformal coating 7. Referring next to FIG. 6, a further perpendicularly oriented eroding operation, eg an ion milling operation is performed on the converted region 9 to expose the shoulder 10 to a selected depth H2 corresponding to the thickness of a metal coating that will become the gate of the FET. In FIG. 7, the shoulder is used to position gate electrodes for theFET. A metal layer 11 is first deposited over the surface of the semi insulating region 9, the remnants of the conformal coating 7 and on the sides and top of the mesa 6. Referring next to FIG. 8, the remaining portions of the conformal coating 7 are now dissolved in a standard lift off operation, which separates the metal 11 at the shoulder 10. The remaining portions of the metal 11 on each side of the mesa 6 make Schottky barrier contacts there with and serve as gate electrodes of the FET. The mesa 6 itself serves as the channel and as part of the ohmic contact 4. The gate metal thickness at this stage is of the order of 0.01 to 0.1 microns. The final structure is shown in FIG. 9. A thicker gate contact metal 12 has been applied by conventional deposition techniques to the thin gate metal electrodes 11. The thick metallization 12 reduces gate resistance. Since the FET device is generally part of a chip, wafer or larger area, a larger contact to the ohmic drain contact 4 can be provided by producing an insulating region by proton bombardment and depositing thereon a metal electrode ohmically connected to contact 4. What has been described is the use of an edge of a layer of deposited material to define a shoulder at an intermediate position between the base and the top of a mesa. A vertical field effect structure is illustrated wherein a mesa channel region has a stepped smaller drain region with the gate contact being made at the step.
