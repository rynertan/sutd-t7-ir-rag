# METHOD OF PRODUCING THERMOFORMED BEVERAGE CONTAINERS AND CONTAINERS PRODUCED BY THIS

## Abstract
A method of forming plastics containers in quantity from plastics sheet, said containers being provided with top flanges by which the container tops maybe rim rolled sealed by metal lids. The plastics materials sheet is hot and annular regions are chilled to remove heat therefrom and leave hot circular regions which are formed into the individual contain ers. The chilling of the annular regions outwardly of where the cuts are made in the material to remove the thermoformed containers ensures that in the said top flanges the plastics material will be thinned down and radially orientated which inhibits cracking of the plastics material during seaming with the metal lids. The containers are specifically designed for holding carbonated beverage and specifically a plastics mat erial is a polyester material, especially polyethylene tereph thalate of high molecular weight.
