# Method to increase reactor capacity for polycondensation of polyesters.

## Abstract
The improvement of passing an inert, preferably vaporiz able and condensible, liquid material through or over a polyester molten mass in a polymer reactor to further increase surface area to volume ratio and or lower the partial pressure of vaporous products of condensation so that viscos ity of the polymer is increased at a substantially greater rate in the same residence time is taught for the prior art condensa tion process in a film forming reactor at temperatures of 275 C. to 300 C., pressures of 0.1 to 760 Torr 10 ² to 10 ² kPa , and residence times of 0.1 to 6 hours. A polymer having an intrinsic viscosity above 0.65, preferably over 0.7 d l g is produced.
