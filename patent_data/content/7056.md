# Microemulsion defoamer composition and a process for producing the composition.

## Abstract
Microemulsion defoamer compositions which are oil in water colloidal dispersions are useful in defoaming aqueous systems such as in paper machines and latex paints. These compositions are prepared by mixing a water dispersible organic material, ethylene oxide condensate, coupling agent, water, basic material and antigelling agent.
