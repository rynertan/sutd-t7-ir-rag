# Reactor and method for preparing uranium trioxide and or plutonium oxide.

## Abstract
A fluidized bed reactor for preparing uranium trioxide and or plutonium oxide from the nitrate by thermal decomposi tion is described. The reactor comprises a a rectangularly shaped bed 1 which satisfies critical safety shape of ²³⁵U and or plutonium, b holes 3, 5 for supplying nitrate aqueous solution into the reactor, c at least two reaction chambers 10, 11 divided by barrages 8, 9 , the bottom of which can be lifted to control their distance from the floor, and an arrange ment by which the oxide powder is taken out mainly by over flow over the top of barrages through the reaction chambers, d heating means A, 14, 15 inside and outside the fluidized bed, and e a gas discharge head structure 16 of upwardly V shaped form.
