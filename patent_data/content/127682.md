## Description
SPECIFICATIONTitle of the Invention Method of Fitting Electronic PartsTechnical Field The present invention relates to a method of fitting electronic parts on printed wiring boards by using an adhesive.Background Art Recently, along with miniaturization of electronic equipments, the method of fitting electronic parts on printed wiring boards in which they are soldered onto the board, after securing them thereon by use of a thermosetting adhesive or an ultraviolet ray setting adhesive, etc., without inserting lead terminals in the printed wiring board, has become often employed. Formerly, electronic parts which were fixed on a substrate without inserting lead wires were mostly limited to small parts such as chip resistances, laminated ceramic condensers or minimold transistors, but recently, such large parts as power IC, flat package IC, DIP type IC, etc., have come into use.Use of such large parts involved a problem that because of the large thermal capacities of these electronic parts, the temperature of the adhesive was hard to rise and, conse quently, the adhesive failed to set. For setting an adhesive, increasing the setting time or raising the setting temperature is necessary, but in that way, such inadequacies as oxidation of copper foils, warping of the printed wiring board causing soldering failure and, further, degradation of characteristics of electronic parts due to long duration of heating were encountered. Long setting time involves such inconveniences as requiring long production processes, wide spaces and larger amount of power. As adhesives which set at relatively low temperatures, epoxy or acryl base two liquid component adhesives are available on the market. Many of them set several minutes after mixing their main component and setting agent, thus their usable periods after the mixing are too short for their proper handling. For this reason, automation of the process of applying such an adhesive on a printed wiring board by means of a dispenser is very difficult.Disclosure of the Invention The present invention provides a means for overcoming such difficulties and thus a fitting method of electronic parts for securing large units on a substrate without inserting lead terminals. Thus the present invention provides a method comprising applying a two liquid component adhesive on the portion of a printed wiring board on which the parts is to be mounted from an appropriate adhesive mixing and applying means, for example, a two liquid components dispenser with a mixer, subsequently, placing the electronic parts an this adhesive, then, tentatively fixing the aforementioned electronic parts by setting the aforementioned adhesive by way of heating or irradiating ultraviolet rays, followed by soldering this printed wiring board. Because the setting can be made at a lower temperature by using the two liquid component adhesive, as compared with single liquid component adhesives, this method is suitable for bonding such large parts as power IC, flat package IC, DIP typeIC, etc., onto printed wiring boards. In the following, the adhesive employed in exercising this invention is described The too liquid component adhesive consists of its main component and a setting promoter, both are acrylic resin compounds. The main component is composed of 100 weight parts of a composite resin material consisting of acrylic oligomers and low viscosity acrylates or methacrylates, 0.1 X 10 weight parts of a thermal polymerization initiator and 20 150 weight parts of an inorganic filler, with some coloring agent, polymerization inhibitor and agent for providing thixotropic property, etc., mixed therewith, as required. As the acrylic oligomers, there are available bisphenol A epoxy acrylate, cresol novolak epoxyacrylate, phenol novolak epoxyacrylate, urethane acrylate bisphenol A tetraethylene glycol diacrylate, etc.As the low viscosity acrylates which are available include acrylic acid alkylesters, trimethylol propane triacrylate, diethylene glycol diacrylate, tetraethylene glycol diacrylate, etc. As the low viscosity methacrylates, methacryl acid alkylester, g efRcerl4te , 2 hydroxy methacrylate, etc., are available. As the thermal polymerization initiators used include organic peroxides such as benzoyl peroxide, t butyl peroxy benzoate and cumene hydroperoxide, etc., and azo compounds such as azo bis isobutyronitryl, etc. As the inorganic filler, silica powder, talc, potassium carbonate, alumina powder and magnesium hydroxide, etc., are used. The setting promoter is composed of 100 weight parts of an acrylic resin composite material of exactly the same composition as that of the main component, 0.1 X 20 weight parts of a polymerization promoter and 20 X 170 weight parts of an inorganic filler, with some coloring agent, polymerization inhibitor and agent for providing the thixotropic property further mixed in, as required. When setting the adhesive by joint application of irrac ation of cltraiolet rays and heating, it is desirable to mix a photo sensitizer into either the main component or the setting promoter or both. As such a photo sensitizer, benzoin alkylether, be Q h I etv , 2,2 diethoxy acetophenone, etc., are employed. As the light source for the irradiation bf ultraviolet rays, high pressure mercury lamps, ultrahigh pressure mercury lamps, metal halide lamps and xenon lamps, etc., are available.Brief Description of the Drawings FIG. 1 is a front view of an adhesive dispenser showing an embodiment of this invention FIG. 2 is an enlarged sectional view of the essential part of the same FIG. 3 is a sectional view of an printed wiring board showing how the electronic unit is mounted and FIG. 4 is a schematic sketch of the setting furnace.The Most Preferable Mode for Exercising the Invention In the following, an embodiment of this invention is described with reference to FIGS. 1 X 4. Numeral I designates tank section. The two liquid components mixer dispenser comprises the tank section 1, mixer section 2 for mixing the main component and the setting promoter and discharge nozzle section 3 and a partition 4 is provided in the tan section 1 to have a structure such that the main component and the setting agent could not mix together.Inside the mixer section 2, several mixing elements 5 are inserted and the mixer section 2 is attached to the tank section 1 by means of a set screw ring 6 and the nozzle section 3 is, in turn, coupled to the tip of the mixer section also by means of a set screw ring 7. Besides, on the top of the tank, there are provided a cover 8 and a hose 9 for supplying the pressurizing air.The main component and the setting promoter are divided in the tank section 1 by the partition 4. The main component and te setting promoter are pressurized by air, mixed with each other while passing through the mixing elements 5 inside the mixer section 2 and, then, discharged through the discharge nozzle section 3. The discharge of the adhesive should desirably performed at an air pressure of 1 X 5 kg cm2. In the following, an embodiment of the adhesive used with the two liquid components mixer dispenser is described. Example Used as the main component was a resin composite material consisting of 100 weight parts of acrylates including 20 parts of cresol novolak epoxy acrylate, 35 weight parts of urethane acrylate, 15 weight parts of 2 hydroxy ethyl methacrylate, 5 weight parts of trimethylol propane triacrylate and 15 weight parts of glycidyl methecrylate and 3 weight parts of t butyl peroxy benzoate, 1 weight part of benzgl dimethyl ketal, 1 weight part of Carmine 6B, 30 weight parts of talc, 50 weight parts of fused silica powder and 0.02 weight parts of parabenzoquinone.Used as the setting promoter was a resin composite material consisting of 100 weight parts of acrylates of exactly the same composition as that of the aforementioned main component, thus including 20 weight parts of bis phenol A epoxy acrylate, 10 weight parts of cresol novolak epoxy acrylate, 35 weight parts of urethane acrylate, 15 weight parts of 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate, 5 weight parts of trimethylol propane triacylate and 15 weight parts of glycidyl methacrylate , compounded with 16 weight parts of a 68 methanol solution of cobalt naphthenate, 3 weight parts of titanium dioxide, 35 weight parts of talc and 50 weight parts of fused silica powder.The main component has a characteristic of being set by irradiation of u .tra violet rays or by heating, it may be set in approximately 15 sec at 1500C, for example. The main component and the setting promoter should desirably be mixed at a weight ratio of about 1 1. If the main component is too much, the setting property will degrade, but if the setting promotoer is used in excess, the electric insulating property will decline and the setting property also get worse a little. Because the mixture of the main component and the setting promoter has a usable duration of about 12 hours after being mixed, its handling is easy and adaptable for automation of production process. In fitting and soldering an electronic parts, after applying the adhesive 12 on a printed substrate and irounting a power IC 13, the adhesive was set by passing this assembly at a conveyor speed of 10 mlmin through a 12 m long setting furnace shown in FIG. 4 composed of a high pressure mercury lamp 14, far infrared ray heater 15 and conveyor 16 and, thereafter, dipping it in solder. No such problem as fall of power IC nor any shift took place, showing faborable sholdered state. The setting furnace was operated with its temperature so set that the surface temperature of the printed substrate was maintained below approximately 1550C at the maximum for about 30 seconds, when it is passed through the setting furnace. Comparison Example The main component above described in the Example is an adhesive which singly is settable by joint application of ultraviolet rays and heat. This main component was singly applied on similar printed wiring boards as those of the Example, a chip resistance, laminated ceramic condenser and power IC were, repectively, bonded thereon and the adhesive was set under the same condition and in the same setting furnace as in the case of the Example. Result With the chip resistance and the laminated ceramic condenser, an adhesive strength of approximately 4 kg was achieved the adhesive was found well set. In contrast, the adhesive with the power IC was found still unset. Industrial Applicability As described in the foregoing, the present invention is characterized zs its capability of bonding such large parts as power IC, flat package IC, etc., on printed wiring boards and setting this adhesive in short time and at a relatively low temperature and achieves prominent effects of improved soldering property and lessened degradation in characteristics of electronic parts because of diminished warping of the printed wiring board and decreased oxidation of copper foils.
