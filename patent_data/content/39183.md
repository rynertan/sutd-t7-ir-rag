# Percutaneous implant device.

## Abstract
A percutaneous device to provide a path 10 from the exterior of the epidermal tissue to interior body spaces includes a button 2 with a top wall having a continuously curved perimeter, a pinched waist shaped side wall and a bottom wall having a continuously curved perimeter of larger area than said top wall, said button 2 providing a path 10 an upper skirt 12 and a lower skirt 14 formed of a biologi cally inert material having an open microstructure for the ingrowth of epidermal and connective tissue, said upper skirt 12 extending up the side wall from the perimeter of said bottom wall in laminar contact with said side wall to an eleva tion just below the minimum diameter of said pinched waist shaped side wall, and said lower skirt 14 being in laminar contact with said bottom wall and connected to said upper skirt 14 adjacent the perimeter of said bottom wall.
