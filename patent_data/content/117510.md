# Injection molding core ring gate system.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a movel core ring gated injection molding system. Pressurized melt from a molding machine flows through the system and into a cavity. A gate 32 leading to the cavity 34 and a bore 14 in the movable mold platen 36 are in alignment and of the same size to receive the head portion of the valve pin 16 which extends from a reduced neck portion 92 . Actuating mechanism drives the valve pin between a retracted closed position to an open position in which the reduced neck portion 92 extends into the cavity 34 . In the closed position, the head portion 90 of the valve pin extends a considerable distance into the bore 84 in the mold platen 78 to provide sufficient cooling to rapidly cool the melt in the cavity adjacent the pin. In one embodiment, the valve pin has a hollow portion adjacent the neck portion to pro vide the valve pin with thermal separation between the hot melt and the cool mold platen. In another embodiment, the valve pin has a copper portion between the hollow portion and the tip end to promote cooling of the melt in the cavity.
