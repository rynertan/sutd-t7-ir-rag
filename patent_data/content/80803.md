# CONTACT TIP FOR A WELDING HEAD

## Abstract
A contact tip 10 for a welding head 12 includes a wear resistant member 34 and one or more transverse passageways 32 . Wear inducing deposits on the surface of consumable electrodes which would result in shortened service life of contact tips, and other surface contaminants are removed from the electrode 28 by a hard, wear resistant member 34 and directed radially outwardly to the external surface 16 through the or each transverse passageway 32 .
