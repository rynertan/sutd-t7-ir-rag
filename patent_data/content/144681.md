PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF POLYMERIC COMPOSITIONS Brief Summary of the InventionTechnical Field This invention is directed in general to a process for the preparation of oligomeric and polymeric compositions, in particular, a process for the polymerization of a reactive monomer derived from the reaction product of a hydroxyalkyl acrylate or methacrylate and a lactone with other ethylenically unsaturated monomers. The oligomeric and polymeric compositions can be made into high quality industrial finishes by incorporation of various conventional crosslinking agents, plus other normally used formulating ingredients.Background Art In the field of coating compositions.efforts have been made and are presently being made to increase the flexibility and hardness of cured coatings and finishes in order to make them more suitable for such uses as automotive finishes.appliance finishes. business machine finishes. house siding general metal finishing and the like. The inclusion of epsilon caprolactone into coating compositions is known to increase the flexibility of the coating films. See, for example. U.S. PatentReissue 30,234 in which epsilon caprolactone i8 reacted with a copolymer, e.g., styrene and 2 hydroxyethyl acrylate. and thereafter with a crosslinking agent, e.g., melamine formaldehyde. to give a crosslinked modified copolymer having desirable flexibility, hardness and chemical durability.The polymeric compositions of the present invention utilize novel compositions containing a reactive monomer derived from the reaction product of a hydroxyalkyl acrylate or methacrylate and a lactone. e.g., epsilon caprolactone, which can polymerize with other ethylenically unsaturated monomers and thereafter can be crosslinked to give polymeric coating compositions having a highly desirable combination of flexibility and hardness in addition to excellent adhesiveness, hydrolytic stability. chemical compatability and solvent resistance. The novel compositions containing a reactive monomer derived from the reaction product of a hydroxyalkyl acrylate or methacrylate and a lactone, e.g.. epsilon caprolactone. are described more fully in copendingU.S. Patent Application Serial No. 438,496, filed on an even date herewith. U.S. Patent 3.655,631 describes. as inExample 1 thereof. the polymerization of epsilon caprolactone with hydroxyethyl acrylate as initiator in the presence of 0.1 by weight of p toluene sulphonic acid as catalyst at a temperature of 450C for a time of 4 hours. The catalyst is described as an organic acid catalyst selected from the group consisting of halogen substituted aliphatic carboxylic acids other than trichloroacetic acid. alkane sulphonic acids.benzene sulphonic acid and lower alkyl substituted benzene sulphonic acids. The product is described in said Example I as a solid unsaturated polyester having a molecular weight of about 960. Example 8 of said patent describes the polymerization of hydroxyethyl methacrylate and epsilon caprolactone using 0.1 by weight of p toluene sulphonic acid catalyst. The polyester product is described as having a molecular weight of 437 and being a viscous liguid. The polyesters produced in said patent have residual acid catalyst present in relatively large amounts i.e., about 1000 parts per million . InExamples 1 and 8 the described polymerization is stated to be complete. The epsilon caprolactone hydroxyethyl acrylate product of Example 1 was further copolymerized with styrene Examples 2 and 3 and vinyl acetate Example 4 . However, the present of such strong acid catalyst in the polyester product could lead to degradation of the product. Also. its presence may decrease the shelf life and pot life of coating systems produced from oligomers containing the polyester product and certain crosslinking agents.The use of a polyester product containing such strong residual acids may generate highly colored by products that may be detrimental in some coating applications. U.S. Patent 4,188,472 describes reacting a a lactone with an ester containing acrylyl or alpha substituted acrylyl group and one or two hydroxyl groups and b reacting the product of a with an isocyanate. Specifically, in Examples I to III. hydroxyethyl acrylate is added to epsilon caprolactone which was heated to 1300C Example 1 or 1200C Examples It and III . Large amounts of catalyst such as TPT titanate greater than 2000 parts per million Example I or a mixture of stannous octoate and dibutyltin dilaurate greater than 1500 parts per million Examples II and III were added to the reaction mixture.Additionally, the reaction carried out in theseExamples utilizes large amounts of inhibitor, i.e., greater than 5000 parts per million. The reaction is carried out at temperatures of 1300C for 6 hours Example I and 1200C for 8 hours Examples II and III . The product of the reaction in theseExamples is described as having a hydroxyl value of 162 Example I , 318 Example II and 122 ExampleIII . In Example II the reaction is stated to be complete. The epsilon caprolactone hydroxyethyl acrylate product of Examples I. II and III was further reacted with a diisocyanate. However, the use of the large amounts of catalyst and inhibitor in the polymerization described in U.S. Patent 4.188.472 can have deletezous effects on the subsequent use of the lactone modified resin in polymerization or copolymerization reactions and or crosslinking reactions European Patent Application No. 0044 393A2 titled Process For Production of A Meth AcrylateResin With Hydroxyl Groups and Modified byEpsilon Caprolactone describes the reaction of at least one monoester of acrylic or methacrylic acid with an alkane diol with 2 4 carbon atoms in the molar ratio of 1.5 1 to 1 3 with epsilon caprolactone.The reaction is described as occurring at a temperature of 60 1300C in the presence of an organotin compound, Specifically. inExample I an adduct from 2 hydroxyethyl acrylate and dibutyltin oxide are heated to 1200C and epsilon caprolactone is added over the course of two hours. This mixture is heated for two more hours at 120 C. This Example was repeated and the reaction product was shown to contain geater than 25 weight percent of unreacted 2 hydroxyethyl acrylate. The epsilon caprolactone hydroxyethyl acrylate product of Example 1 was further polymerized with methyl methacrylate, 2 ethylhexyl acrylate and 2 hydroxyethyl acrylate.

The coating compositions of this invention exhibit highly desirable flexibility and stability. chemical compatibility and solvent resistance. The polymeric composition and the crosslinked polymeric coating composition prepared by the above described processes are also part of this invention.As used in the specification and the claims hereof, oligomeric compositions are included within the meaning of the term polymeric composition Detailed Descriation The novel compositions containing a reactive monomer derived from the reaction product of a hydroxyalkyl acrylate or methacrylate and a lactone utilized in the process of this invention in preparing the polymeric compositions and the crosslinked polymeric coating compositions are more fully described in copending U.S. Patent ApplicationSerial No. 438,496. filed on an even date herewith.The reactive monomer containing compositvions are prepared by reacting a lactone with a hydroxyalkyl acrylate or methacrylate. The lactone used as the starting material is characterized by the following formula EMI8.1 wherein 24 and R5 are hydrogen or alkyl of from 1 to 12 carbon atoms, and x is from 4 to 7. The preferred lactone is epsilon caprolactone. The hydroxyalkyl acrylates or methacrylates include 2 hydroxyethyl acrylate. hydroxypropyl acrylate. hydroxybutyl acrylate. 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate, 2 hydroxypropyl methacrylate, 2 hydroxy 3 chloro propyl methacrylate, 2 hydroxy 3 chloro propyl acrylate. 2.3 dihydroxy propyl methacrylate, 2,3 dihydroxy propyl acrylate, and the like, or mixtures thereof. Hydroxyethyl acrylate is preferred. The reactive monomer containing compositions are prepared by reacting the lactone with the hydroxyalkyl acrylate or methacrylate in the presence of less than about 200 parts per million, preferably less than 100 part per million, of a catalyst. The catalyst which may be used herein includes one or more organometallic compounds and other metallic compounds such as stannic chloride or ferric chloride and other Lewis and protonic acids. Preferred catalysts include stannous octoate, dibutyltin dilaurate, and other tin compounds titanates such as tetraisopropyl titanate and butyl titanate and the like. The reactive monomer preparation reaction is carried out at a temperature of from about 1000C to about 1400C, preferably from about 120 C to about 130 C. The reaction may be carried out at atmospheric pressure although higher or lower pressures may be used. The reaction is generally carried out in the presence of oxygen to inhibit polymerization of the hydroxyalkyl acrylate or methacrylate. The reaction is carried out for a period of from about 2 hours to about 20 hours.preferably from about 3 hours to about 11 hours. The reactive monomer preparation reaction is carried out in the presence of a suitable inhibitor to prevent polymerization of the hydroxyalkyl acrylate or methacrylate double bond.These inhibitors include the monomethyl ether of hydroquinone, benzoquinone. phenothiazine, methylhydroquinone, 2,5 di t butylquinone, hydroquinone, and other common free radical inhibitors known in the art. The level of inhibitor used is less than 1000 parts per million. preferably less than 800 parts per million, and most preferably less than 600 parts per million. The reactive monomer preparation reaction is carried out by adding the lactone to a reaction vessel and heating this to reaction temperature about 100 C to about 1400C while sparging the lactone with an inert gas such as nitrogen. The lactone may be dried with, for example. conventional agents such as molecular sieves before adding it to the reaction vessel. When the reaction temperature is achieved or soon thereafter, the inert gas sparge is changed to a mixture of inert gas and oxygen such as air . Various alternatives may b used. For example. the system may be sparged with the inert gas and oxygen mixture for a short period of time, i.e., about 5 to 10 minutes. after which the sparge is discontinued. and the gas mixture then used only to flush the reactor vapor space throughout the reaction or the inert gas sparge is stopped and the system is flushed with the mixture throughout the reaction or the gas mixture may be sparged through the system while an inert gas is additionally used to flush the vapor space during the reaction period. Combinations of these alternatives may be used if desired. The hydroxyalkyl acrylate or methacrylate may be mixed with the catalyst and inhibitor and this mixture added to the heated lactone.Alternatively, the inhibitor may be added to the lactone prior to heating. Also the lactone may be added to the hydroxyalkyl acrylate or methacrylate which has been heated. or all the reactants may be added initially to the reactor and the process carried out. Several variations in the mode of addition of the lactone. acrylate or methacrylate, catalyst and inhibitor may be used. The final reaction mixture is maintained at the reaction temperature for about 2 to 20 hours. The reaction mixture is collected and may be used without purification. If desired the reaction mixture may be purified by conventional techniques such as vacuum stripping. The reactive monomer prepartion reaction may also be carried out in the presence of a suitable solvent which does not contain. for example, active hydrogens or polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated groups. These solvents include ketones, esters, ethers, aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, and the like, or mixtures thereof. Preferred solvents include esters, such asCellosolve acetate. Preferably, epsilon caprolactone is reacted with hydroxyethyl acrylate or methacrylate in the ratio of one mole of the acrylate or methacrylate to from one to 12 moles of the lactone. These novel compositions containing a reactive monomer derived from the reaction product of a hydroxyalkyl acrylate or methacrylate and a lactone may be solid or liquid, and the most preferred compositions are liquid. The most preferred reactive monomer containing compositions are produced by reacting epsilon caprolactone with hydroxyethyl acrylate or methacrylate in a ratio of one mole of the hydroxyethyl acrylate or methacrylate to two or three moles of the epsilon caprolactone. These preferred compositions contain the reactive monomers of formula I , O to 5 weight percent of lactone, less than 10 weight percent of hydroxyethyl acrylate or methacrylate, minor amounts of additional reaction product, 400 to 600 parts per million of inhibitor, and catalyst residues in amounts of about 50 parts per million. The oligomeric and polymeric compositions and crosslinked oligomeric and polymeric coating compositions of this invention can be prepared by conventional polymerization techniques in which the novel reactive monomer containing composition is blended with one or more ethylenically unsaturated monomers in the presence of solvents, chain transfer agents and polymerization catalysts and heated to about 1000C to 2000C for about 2 hours to 6 hours.Solvents which can be used in these conventional polymerization techniques are well known in the art and include for example, methyl normal amyl ketone 2 heptanone , normal butyl alcohol, methyl ethyl ketone 2 butanone and the like. Suitable chain transfer agents include t dodecylmercaptan and the like. Suitable polymerization catalysts include, for example, azo bis isobutyronitrile, benzoyl peroxide and the like. Suitable ethylenically unsaturated monomers which can be employed in the process of this invention include among others hydroxyl functional acrylic monomers, the esters of acrylic or methacrylic acid and monohydric alcohols, alpha, beta ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids and vinyl hydrocarbons. The hydroxyl functional acrylic monomers can include 2 hydroxyethyl acrylate, 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate and the like. Suitable esters of acrylic or methacrylic acid and monohydric alcohols include among others ethyl acrylate, n butyl acrylate, t butyl acrylate, isobutyl acrylate. 2 ethylhexyl acrylate, hexyl acrylate, decyl acrylate, cyclohexyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, propyl methacrylate, isopropyl methacrylate, butyl methacrylate, isobutyl methacrylate, lauryl methacrylate and the like. The preferred esters are ethyl acrylate and butyl acrylate.Suitable alpha, beta ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids include among others acrylic acid. methacrylic acid, itatonic acid, crotonic acid and the like.Preferred are acrylic acid and methacrylic acid.Suitable vinyl hydrocarbons include, for example, styrene, alpha methylstyrene, vinyl toluene, t butylstyrene. chlorostyrene and the like. The preferred vinyl hydrocarbon is styrene. Other monomers such as vinyl acetate, acrylonitrile, vinyl chloride. methacrylonitrile and the like can also be included in the polymeric compositions of this invention. The concentration of the novel reactive monomer in the polymeric compositions of this invention can range from about 5 to about 90 weight percent, preferably from abut 20 to about 40 weight percent. The concentration of the other ethylenically unsaturated monomers in the polymeric compositions of this invention can range from about 90 to about 5 weight percent, preferably from about 60 to about 80 weight percent. The number average molecular weight of the polymeric compositions of this invention can range from 1,000 or less to about 100,000 or greater. The polymeric compositions of the present invention utilize epsilon caprolactone in novel reactive monomer compositions which are reacted with other ethylenically unsaturated monomers by addition polymerization. Epsilon caprolactone is not grafted into the polymeric compositions. It is believed that a unique distribution of caprolactone along the polymer backbone is obtained by addition polymerization of the reactive monomer as opposed to polymers prepared by the grafting reaction.Polymeric compositions prepared by either addition polymerization or grafting of caprolactone can contain the same amount of caprolactone but the distribution of caprolactone along the polymer backbone would be different. In grafting. the caprolactone distributes along the polymer backbone in a statistical manner whereas, in addition polymerization of a caprolactone containing reactive monomer. the caprolactone is distributed in a nonstatistical manner. Unique coating properties can be obtained utilizing the polymeric compositions of the present invention as opposed to polymeric compositions grafted with caprolactone. Also in the grafting reaction caprolactone may react with any acidic monomers used in preparing the polymer, whereas by using the caprolactone containing reactive monomers, no reaction with acidic monomers will occur. The crosslinkable polymeric coating compositions of this invention contain an isocyanate resin or an amino resin selected from the group consisting of melamine formaldehydes, urea formaldehydes and benzoguanamine formaldehydes. A melamine formaldehyde resin i8 preferred such as hexamethoxymethyl melamine. Butylolated melamine formaldehydes can also be used. The concentration of the amino resin in the polymeric coating compositions of this invention can range from about 10 to about 50 weight percent of the total weight of the coating composition. The crosslinkable polymeric coating compositions can also contain an organic solvent and a catalyst as optional components. Any of the conventional solvents used in the coatings industry can be used at a concentration preferably below 50 weight percent of the total weight of the coating composition. While large amounts could conceivably be used. the use of larger amounts would destroy the high solids nature of the coating solvents are generally added in the small amounts indicated to improve flowability during application of the coating composition to the substrate. In some instances an acid catalyst might be desired to improve the efficiency of the isocyanate resin or amino resin crosslinking reaction during curing. The concentration of the catalyst can vary from zero to about 10 weight percent based on the total weight of the coating composition. The particular catalyst used and its concentration are dependent to a degree upon its catalytic activity and the specific components present in the coating composition. These catalysts are known to those skilled in the art and include hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, p toluene sulfonic acid, methane sulfonic acid, dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid, phosphoric acid and its alkyl derivatives, maleic acid. trimellitic acid, phthalic acid, succinic acid, and the like. The crosslinkable polymeric coating compositions can also contain pigments, fillers. and other additives conventionally present in coating compositions in their conventional quantities. The particular ones selected are of no consequence to the basic invention. In preparing the crosslinkable polymeric coating compositions, the ingredients are mixed by the conventional procedures used in the production of paints, inks or coating compositions.These procedures are so well known to those skilled in the art that they do not require further discussion here. The crosslinkable polymeric coating compositions are applied to a surface or substrate by conventional means and then thermally cured by heating at a temperature of about 100 C to 3750C preferably from 1250C to 2000C for a period of time sufficient to obtain a dry film. Generally, this time will range from about one minute to two hours.The components present in a particular crosslinkable polymeric coating composition will determine the temperature and time that will be required to obtain an adequate cure and a good film coating. The crosslinkable polymeric compositions of this invention can be high solids coating compositions and they can contain as much as 90 weight percent or more solids therein. Generally the total solids content of the coatings compositions of this invention range from about 25 to 90 weight percent, preferably from about 50 to 90 weight percent, of the total weight of the coating composition.
