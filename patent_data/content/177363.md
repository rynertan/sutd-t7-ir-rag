# INTERNAL BEAD REMOVAL TOOL

## Abstract
A tool for removing the internal bead which is formed when a pair of synthetic plastics pipes are joined together by fusion. So that the tool can be used very easily and convenient ly, it includes a head end 10 carrying a cutter blade 28 and an operating rod 12 which when turned first causes the cutter blade 28 to cut radially into the bead and then causes the head end 10 to be turned bodily so that the bead is sliced from within the pipe in a single rotation of the tool.
