# Dual tandem composite cylinder assembly.

## Abstract
Duel tandem composite cylinder assembly 1, 96 in cludes a cylinder 2 having circumferential or hoop stress windings 20,21 surrounding a pair of hydraulic chambers 3, 4 in series to react the circumferential loads and prevent diametrical expansion of the hydraulic chambers. Longitu dinal tension windings 70 extend over substantially the entire length of the cylinder outwardly of the circumferential windings to react the axial loads which the cylinder must contain. Compressive cylinder composite windings 65, 95 are also provided for carrying compressive loads generated within the cylinder. The hydraulic chambers are desirably lined with removable liner members 22, 23 to facilitate changing of seals and refurbishment of the cylinder.
