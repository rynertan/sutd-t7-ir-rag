# Method and apparatus for heat sealing strap in a strapping machine.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus is provided for securing together overlapping portions of a thermoplastic strap loop around an object. After the strap 22 is fed to form the loop, the upper strap portion is restrained while pulling the strap trailing portion to tension the loop. Lenths of the upper and lower strap portions are then gripped together in face to face contact to hold the loop in tension. The trailing portion is severed from the loop lower strap portion, and the restraint of the upper strip portion is terminated. A heating member 50 is extended between the upper and lower strap portions 46, 48 in a direction generally parallel to the strap length. The upper and lower strap portions are pressed against the heating member to melt regions of the strap. The heating member is withdrawn, and the melted regions are pressed together as the melted regions solidify to form a joint. included in the apparatus are coacting first and second gripper means 96, 102 an anvil 70 a cutter 84 , and a heating member 50 . One of the gripper means defines a strap length receiving region below at least a portion of the gripping means for accomodating the lower strap portion prior to severing the trailing portion of the strap.
