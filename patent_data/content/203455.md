# Subscriber line monitoring circuit.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a circuit for monitoring a capacity of a subscriber line to which a capacitor 2 equivalently represen tative of a telephone set is connected. This monitoring circuit has a test sequence for the subscriber line capacity. The test sequence comprises a first step to connect the subscriber line to a test circuit 27 , and a second step to apply a backward voltage to the subscriber line, thereby to discharge an electric charge stored in the equivalent capacitor. The test sequence further comprises a third step to apply a forward voltage to the subscriber line trough a reference capacitor, thereby to charge the equivalent capacitor to evaluate the capacity value of the equivalent capacitor on the basis of a voltage appearing ac ross the equivalent capacitor, thus to effect a capacitive test of the subscriber line. Accordingly, where the telephone set in cludes a diode bridge 17 in an interface of the subscriber line, diodes constituting the diode bridge can become conductive so as to enable the formation of a current charging path at the time of the execution of the third step. Thus, this makes it pos sible to conduct a capacitive test of not only ordinary tele phone sets but also telephone sets of the type including the di ode bridge in its subscriber line interface.
