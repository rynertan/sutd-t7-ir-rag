## Description
1,10 phenanthroline 2,9 dicarboxylic acid and derivatives and their use in fluorescent immunoassaxr This invention relates to reagents for fluorescent assay and more especially to novel markers which can be attached to protein for purposes of fluorescent labelling such as used in immunoassay methods, and to immunoassay methods using the novel markers.Radio immunoassay RIA methods have been used for some years, but there are hazards involved in handling, storage, and disposal of radioactive materials and there has been growing opposition against the use of radioisotopes in some countries.Furthermore, there are disadvantages associated with radio imunoassays methods, such as the short shelf life Of 1251 labelled antibodies and antigens 6 24 weeks arising from the short halt life of 125I 60 days and this necessitates frequent radioiodinations and often requires disposal of unused outdated reagents. This increases the cost per test associated with RIAs for the end user. The various drawbacks and disa vantages have led to the current trend to replace radioimmuno assays FIAs with nonisotopic methods, the most important of which are enzyme immunoassay EIA and fluorescent immunoassay FIA .Although EIAs have found wide applicability recently, there is great concern about their sensitivity and reproducibility. In some cases, there is uncertainty about the choice of end point which should be chosen for the enzymatic reaction after the addition of substrate. The measurement of the enzyme activity rate constant is a more reliable method but this prolongs the assay and adds to its cost by requiring more sophisticated computational hardware. The high sensitivity of enzymatic activity to temperature difference is also a source of imprecision. Another major source of error is the presence in serum of enzymes which have effects similar to the one employed for labeling or of enzyme inhibitors which wouldhave the opposite effect. In current fluorescent immunoassays, immunoreactive proteins, i.e. antibodies. antigens or haptens are tagged covalently with a fluorescent label such as fluorescein, various rhodamines, dansyl chloride, or umbelliferone and the increase or decrease of fluorescence due to the inununoloqical reaction is measured.Generally, the sensitivity of FIAs which employ these labels is lower than that of RIAs because of Rayleiqh and Raman scattering and interference due to fluorescent substances such as proteins and bilirubin in serum. The scattering problem is partly overcome with the use of dedicated filter systems.The underlying problem with fluorescent labels of current general use is their small Stokes shift the difference between the wavelengths of the absorbed, stimulating radiation and of the emitted, fluorescent radiation, respectively and their short fluorescent lifetimes which are comparable with those of interfering substances in serum. For example, fluorescein has absorption and emission maxima at 490 nm and 520 nm, respectively, and a fluorescence lifetime of only 5 nanoseconds.Recently, the use of lanthanide chelates, especially those of europium, has been suggested as a way of eliminating background fluorescence to increase immunoassay sensitivity, for example in United States patent 4,374,120 issued February 15, 1983 in the name Soini et al. The wavelengths of the absorption and emission maxima for these systems depend on the chelating ligands but the Stokes shifts are typically at least 200 nm and the fluorescence lifetimes are in the order of 100 microseconds. Background fluorescence can be eliminated completely with the use of time resolved fluoresence immunoassay, for example by using of a gated fluorometer wherein a time delay between a pulsed excitation and detection of emission removes short lived fluorescence due to interfering fluorochromes.Lanthanide chelates have the unique characteristic of absorbing light to give a high yield of linelike emission with long fluorescence lifetimes. The emission results from intramolecular energy transfer from the lowest ligand triplet states to the metal ion, as reported by M.L. Bhaumik and M.A.El Sayed, .X. Chem. Phys., 42, 787 788 1965 . Time resolved spectroscopy of europium chelates using a stroboscopic technicue was performed by Bhaunik and co workers in 1965,M.L. Bhaumik, G.L. Clark and L. Ferder, Rev. Sci. Inst., 36 37 40 1965 .Although the fluorescent chelates of lanthanides, as described for example in the above mentioned United States patent 4,374,120, provide acceptable results in fluorescence spectroscopy analysis, the chelates of this patent are difficult to manufacture as their preparation requires a multi step process which is difficult and complex to commercialize.We have now found that certain novel 1,10 phenanthroline derivatives form lanthanide chelates which fluoresce in aqueous solution, and which may be employed in fluorescent immuno and other assays. These derivatives can be readily manufactured by relatively simple procedures.We have found that the known compound 1,10 phenanthroline 2,9dicarboxylic acid of the formulaEMI3.1 is a ligand which forms chelates with lanthanide salts which are highly fluorescent in aqueous solution. Further, as explained in more detail below, we have found various novel derivatives of the above acid form lanthanide chelates of like fluorescent capabilities. In some cases, the molecular structure of these derivatives enhances and advantageously modifies their radiation absorbing and fluorescent radiation emitting characteristics. These derivatives include compounds containing one or more functional groups that are capable of couplinq covalently with proteins, or one or more qroups readily convertible to such functional groups, and which are useful as markers for conducting fluorescent immuonassay. broadly, the invention comprises reagents for fluorescent assay comprising 1, 10 phenanthroline 2,9 dicarboxylic acid compundc selected from the group consisting of compounds of the formula I EMI4.1 and trihalomethyl forms, salts, esters and acid halides thereof which are readily hydrolyzed to form the acid of the formula I . In the above formula R1 to R6 represent groups which may be suDstituted in the compound of formula I without deleteriously affecting the fluorescent activity of lanthanide chelates formed therefrom. In the preferred forms, the R1 toR6 substitients serve to enhance or advantageously modify the fluorescent activity of said chelates. Each R1 to R6 may be independently hydrogen, XR7 n or Rg , wherein X is S03 M , wherein M is a metal ion, a functional group which couples covalently with proteins or a group readily convertible to such functional group, R7 is a divalent aliphatic residue having 1 to 12 carbons, or a divalent carbocyclic or heterocyclic residue having 3 to 12 carbons, and n is 0 or 1, and wherein R8 is an aliphatic group having 1 to 12 carbons, or a carbocyclic or heterocyclic group having 3 to 12 carbons or one or more pairs of adjacent R1 to R6 groups form together with the carbons to which they are substituents a a carbocylic or heterocyclic ring containing 3 to 12 carbons, b anX substituted carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring of the general formula Ia EMI5.1 whereinEMI5.2 is a divalent carbocyclic or heterocyclic residue having 1 to 12 carbons, X has the signification given above, and m is an integer from 1 to 4 or c an orthoquinone linkage EMI5.3 with the proviso that at least one of R1 to R6 is XtR7tn, wherein X, R7 and n have the significations given above, or at least one pair of adjacent R1 to R6 groups form a ring of the formula Ia given above or an orthoquinone linkage.As noted above R7 and Rg may be the divalent resides and the monovalent residues, respectively, of an aliphatic compound, e.g. an alkane or alkene, having 1 to 12 carbons.Such aliphatic compound may be branched or straight chain.When R7 is a divalent carboxylic residue, R7 may be a divalent residue of a simple single ring aromatic compound, e.g.phenylene, or the divalent residue of a condensed nuclear hydrocarbon e.g. of naphthalene, or of an alicyclic compound whether saturated, e.g. cyclohexane or unsaturated, e.g.cyclohexene, having 3 to 12 carbons.Similarly, R8 may be a simple aromatic group e.g. phenyl, or a condensed nuclear hydrocarbon group, e.g. naphthyl group, or a saturated or unsaturated alicyclic group e.g. cyclohexyl or cyclohexenyl.R7 may be a divalent residue of a simple heterocyclic compound, with or without unsaturation in the ring, e.g. R7 may be a divalent residue of morpholine, or may be the divalent residue of a compound containing two or more condensed rings one or more of which may be heterocyclic ring, e.g. R7 may be a divalent residue of quinoline or of purine.Similarly R8 may be a simple heterocyclic group e.g. morpholino or may be a group combining condensed rings e.g. quinolinyl.Where an adjacent pair of R1 to R6 groups form a carboxylic or heterocylic ring, with or without one or more X substituents, such ring may be a simple ring or a condensed ring, e.g. one of the aromatic, alicyclic or heterocylic ring systems mentioned above. More specifically, one preferred class of compounds in accordance with the invention comprises 1,10 phenanthroline2,9 dicarboxylic acid compounds selected from the qroup consisting of compounds of the formulaEMI7.1 wherein each X is the same or different and is SO3 M , a functional group which couples covalently with proteins, a group readily convertible to such functional group, or isEMI7.2 wherein X is a functional group which couples covalently with protein or a group readily convertible to such functional group, and trihalomethyl forms salts, esters and acid halides thereof which are readily hydrolyzed to form the acid of formula if . We have found that of the above group of compounds, derivatives of 4,7 diphenyl 1,10 phenanthroline 2,9 dicarboxylic acid hereinafter DPPDA are more suitable for fluorescent immunoassay because they absorb light in the 300 350 nm region which eliminates the need for quartz optics required for ligands having absorption maxima at lower wavelengths. Thus a preferred class of compounds comprises 4,7 diphenyl1,10 phenanthroline 2,9 dicarboxylic acid compounds of the formulaEMI8.1 wherein each X is the same or different and is SO3 M , a functional group which couples covalently with proteins, a group readily convertible to such functional group, and trihalomethl forms, salts, esters and acid halides thereof which are readily hydrolyzed to form the acid of formula III .A further exemplary class of compounds in accordance with the invention comprises derivatives of 4,5,9,14 tetraaza 1,2,3,4 dibenzanthracene 3,6 dicarboxylic acid hereinafter TADDA of the formulaEMI8.2 Compounds in accordance with the invention which are derivatives of TADDA have the formulaEMI9.1 wherein X is SO3 M , a functional group which couples covalently with proteins, a group readily convertible to such functional group, and m is an integer from 1 to 4.As far as the inventors are aware, DPPDA, TADDA and their derivatives are novel compounds. DPPDA and TADDA are useful intermediates for preparation of markers for fluorescent assay of proteins since the phenyl rings and benzo substituent therecf provide convenient sites for derivatization by substitution therein of functional groups which couple covalently with proteins.The marker compounds of the general formula I given above wherein a pair of adjacent R1 to R6 substituents form an orthoquinone linkage may be coupled to proteins through the known reaction mechanisms whereby orthoquinones react with amino compounds, to form protein marker conjugates.Examples of suitable functional groups i.e. examples of X in the above formulae include diazonium, isothiocyanato and succinamic acid groups i.e. of the formulae Y N2 wherein Y is a monovalent anion, S C N andEMI9.2 In the above diazonium groups, Y can be any anion which forms diazonium salts reactive with proteins. Examples of suitable anions include halide ions and acid sulphate ion, HO3SO . Preferably Y is chloride.While various examples of protein coupling groups X have been given above, the invention is by no means limited to the use of the above mentioned groups. For example, X may be the monovalent residue of any compound which can be substituted in aromatic rings and which provides an atom or group capable of linking covalently with proteins, for example with lysine amino groups or with N terminal amino groups of proteins. Various such compounds are known in the prior art and need not be discussed in detail herein.A particularly preferred class of compounds useful as markers for fluorescent immunoassay comprises those in which the functional coupling groups X are halosulfonyl groups of the formula ZSO2 wherein Z is halogen, and more preferably chlorine, obtained by reaction of a halosulfonic acid ZSO3H with, for example DPPDA. Certain of the halosulfonyl compounds, and more particularly the halosulfonyl derivatives of DPPDA, form lanthanide chelates which provide remarkably high fluorescent intensities.Further examples of the groups X in the above formulae include hydroxyalkyleneaminosulfonyl groups e.g. HOCH2CH2NHSO2 , azo groups, e.g.EMI10.1 and hydroxyalkyleneaminothiocarbamyl groups, e.g.EMI11.1 While such groups are not capable of coupling direct with proteins, they are readily convertible to groups capable of such coupling. For example, the hydroxyalkylene groups of the above hydroxyalkyleneaminosulfonyl and hydroxyalkyleneamino thiocarbamyl groups may be readily oxidized to, for example, aldehyde, using oxidative enzymes such as horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase HLAD in the presence of a hydrogen acceptin co enzyme e.g. NAD, in accordance with the reaction scheme EMI11.2 The aldehyde groups thus formed are capable of coupling with amino groups of proteins e.q. through the Schiff base forming mechanism.The azo compound mentioned above has aromatic ring sites adjacent the OH groups which are highly active and readily accept electrophilic substituents e.g. halosulfonation to yield halosulfonyl groups which can couple readily with proteins.In the compounds having the functional groups X substituted in the phenyl rings of DPPDA, each X may be the same or different and the X substituent may be in the 2 , 3 or 4 positions.Conveniently, however, for ease of manufacture and of use of the markers, each X is the same and each is in the 4 position.In the compounds having the functional group or groups Xsubstituted in the terminal benzo group of TADDA, each X may be the same or different and may be in the 10 , 11 , 12 or 13positions. Conveniently, for ease of manufacture and use of the markers, each X is the same and the molecule contains an Xgroup in each of the 11 and 12 positions.In the preferred forms of the present compounds, the or each group X is free from nitrogen atom having an unshared pair of electrons adjacent the aromatic or heterocyclic ring to which the qroup X is attached. We have found that the presence of such nitrogen atom in compounds of the general formula I significantly reduces the fluorescent intensities of the lanthanide chelates forred from the compounds.Thus, for example, the fluorescent intensities of compounds ofIne formula Ill above having various X substituents, in the presence of excess europium in aqueous solution, expressed in percentages relative to that of the unsubstituted compoundDPPDA, are as follows Table 1 X Groups Relative Intensity h , DPPUA 100 2 41 0 CH3 C NH , 5.2 0 H00CCH2CH2C NH , 8.5 NH2 0.27Although applicants do not wish to be bound by any theory, it is suggested that the progressive impairment of the fluorescent intensities is evidenced in the above Table as a result of electron donation by the nitrogen atom to the marker molecule, so that there is an increase in its Bmax of excitation and its excited state is no longer at an energy level effective to transfer energy to the europium or other lanthanide ion. In contrast, the fluorescent intensities achieved with preferred compounds wherein the group X does not have a nitrogen with unshared electrons adjacent the aromatic or heterocyclic rings, are much greater. For example, the preferred sulfonyl chloride derivative of DPPDA hydrolyzes in the presence of water to yield DPPDA disulfonate which in the presence of europium ions forms a chelate exhibiting fluorescent intensity 2 greater than that of the DPPDA chelate X is H in the above Table . The soluble compounds wherein the group X is a sulfonate e.g. SO3 M wherein M is a metal ion e.g. sodiur, potassium, etc.are not capable of coupling with proteins. However it has been found that certain of these compounds and more notably 4,7 diphenyl 1 ,10 phenantholine 2,9 dicarboxylic acid disulfonate i.e. the compound of formula III wherein each X is SO3 M produce high fluorescent intensities in the presence of europium but do not fluoresce in the presence of other lanthanides such as terbium III , samarium III and dysprosium III salts. Thus these compounds may be employed as a water soluble selective reagent capable of indicating or determining europium in the presence of other lanthanides.With regard to the compounds wherein X is a group which couples covalently with proteins, such compounds may be used as markers for determining the concentration of an immunoreactive protein, e.g. an antigen, antibody or hapten in a sample of unknown concentration. The assay is performed by coupling the protein covalently to the marker compound, chelating the conjugate thus formed with a lanthanide salt, exposing the chelated conjugate to fluorescence stimulating radiation, determining the intensity of the fluorescence thereby stimulated, and deriving a value indicative of the concentration of the protein in the sample. Preferably, in forminq the protein marker conjugates, the compounds of the above formulae I , II , III and V are used in the free diacid form. Where this is more convenient or desirable, it is however possible to supply the compounds in the form of trihalomethyl derivatives, e.g trichloromethyl wherein COOH in the above formulae is replaced by CC13, salts, for example sodium salts, esters, for example n propyl diesters, or acid halides, for example chlorides, of the said diacids which are readily hydrolyzed to the free diacid form, it then beinq necessary merely to hydrolyze the said trihalomethyl form, salts, esters or acid halides to obtain the free diacid which forms a chelate witn the lanthanide.The lanthanide salt may be any which forms fluorescent chelates with the marker or conuqate. Examples include terbium and samarium salts and, more preferably, europium salts.The assay may be conducted by comparing the fluorescent intensity of the chelated protein marker compound conjugate with that of a sample containing a known concentration of the same chelated protein marker conjugate, or, in some cases, by direct measurement of the fluorescent intensity of the sample containing an unknown concentration of the chelated protein marker conjugate. The protein marker compound conjugate can be used in association with Lewis base synergists which enhance the fluorescence of the lanthanide chelate when water is present by removing water molecules from the coordination sphere of the metal ion. Such synergists may be tri n octylphosphineoxide TOPO dihexyl sulfoxide and tri n butyl phosphate. It is however, one advantage of the preferred markers of the invention that they form hiqhly fluorescent chelates in aqueous solution, providing fluorescent intensities satisfactory for assay purposes, without requiring additions of such synergists. The markers of the present invention form protein marker conjugate chelates with lonq fluorescence decay times and therefore suitable for time resolved fluorescene immunoassay. The preferred markers form conjugate chelates which exhibit such high fluorescent intensities that assays with good sensitivity and wide dynamics range can be conducted even with the use of a non gated fluorometer.As noted above, one preferred class of markers in accordance with the invention comprises derivatives of 1,10 phenanthroline 2,9 dicarboxylic acid i.e. PDCA, the compound of formula I in which X is H . We have found that PDCA is a ligand which forms chelates with lanthanides, for example trivalent europium salts, which are highly fluorescent in aqueous solution without requiring the use of any Lewis base synergist. Without wishing to be bound by any theory, it is suggested that the phenanthroline diacid compounds function as tetradentate ligands with lanthanides such as europium, terbium and samarium.As will be readily appreciated, markers useful for fluorescent immunoassay of proteins may be readily formed by derivatization of PDCA to introduce functional groups X , for example the above mentioned groups to obtain compounds of the formula II above which are capable of coupling covalently with protein molecules.We have found that, whereas PDCA chelates have maximum excir tat ion wavelengths below about 300 nm, chelates of DPPDA, TADDA and their derivatives exhibit maximum excitation wavelengths above about 300 nm, thus avoiding the need for quartz optics in the optical systems employed in the fluorescent immunoassay.Without wishing to be bound by any theory, it is suggested that the relatively short wavelengths of excitation of PDCA chelates is because phenanthrolines do not possess extensive conjugation of n electrons, and the double bond between the 5,6 carbons is rather isolated. The introduction of phenyl groups into the phenanthroline ring system, as in DPPDA, or of a conjugated heterocyclic ring system, as in TADDA, appears to modify the electron conjugation system and increases the A max of excitation. The phenyl groups of DPPDA and the terminal benzene ring of TADDA further provide sites which may be readily derivatized by substitution of functional groups, for example the functional groups mentioned above, to form compounds of the formula III or V above which are capable of coupling covalently with protein molecules.In the case of TADDA, for example, as will readily be appreciated by those skilled in the art, reactive functional groups such as isothiocyanato, diazonium or sulfonyl halide may be readily introduced at any one or more of the 10, 11, 12 or 13 positions.Preparation of Ligands PDCA, DPPDA and TADDA 1,10 phenanthroline 2,9 dicarboxylic acid PDCA is a known compound and may be prepared by a two step oxidation of 2,9 dimethyl 1,10 phenanthroline neocuproine with selenium dioxide followed by nitric acid, as described by Chandler et al, J. Heterocylic Chem., 18, 599 01 1981 .We have found that 4,7 diphenyl 1,10 phenanthroline 2,9 dicar boxylic acid DPPDA may be prepared from 2,9 dimethyl 4,7 diphenyl 1 , 10 phenanthroline bathocuproine by oxidation with selenium dioxide to form 4,7 diphenyl 1 ,10 phenanthroline 2,9 dicarboxyaldehyde, followed by oxidation to the acid with nitric acid or by chlorination with N chlorosuccinimide to form 2,9 bis trichloromethyl 4,7 diphenyl 1,10 phenanthroline, and subsequent hydrolysis, in accordance with the following reaction schemes EMI17.1 TADDA may be prepared for neocuproine by forming a cobalt coordination complex of neocuproine to facilitate the oxidation of the 5, 6 carbon carbon double bond to the 5, 6 quinone, which oxidation may be performed using potassium bromide, sulfuric acid and nitric acid, followed by demetallation of the quinone with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, condensation of the quinone with o phenylenediamine to form the dimethyl analog of the desired dicarboxylic compound, and chlorination of the methyl groups and hydrolysis to form the dicarboxylic acid, in accordance with the following reaction scheme EMI18.1 Some non limiting examples of methods of preparation of ligands will now be given.

The fluorescence of these solutions was determined using a PerkinElmer fluorometer non gated . The fluorescence count ranged from about 0.204 for the lowest concentrations of EuC13 and up to about 288 for the hiqhest concentrations.Similarly, the fluorescence of Pr CA in an excess of EUCl3, using aqueous solutions containing concentrations of PDCA ranging from 1 x 10 10 to 1 x 10 6 mole l in 1 x 10 5 Etc13 in 0.05 M TRIS at pH 7.0 was determined and the fluorescence count was found to be about 0.088 for the lowest concentration of PDCA and about 15.9 for the highest. Thus, the PDCA Eu system was found to be highly fluorescent in aqueous solution without the use of TOPO or other Lewis base synergist. Maximum excitation and emission occurred at 290 nm and 613 nm respectively. The limit of detection of europium in excess PDCA and of PDCA in the presence of excess europium each appeared to be 1 x 10 10 M. DPPDA lanthanide solutionsUsing the method described above, aqueous solutions of DPPDA Eu were found to be fluorescent in the absence of TOPO or other synergist with excitation and emission maxima at 330 nm and 613 nr, respectively. Aqueous solutions containing 1 x 10 12 to 1 x 10 6 mole l EuCl3 in an excess 1 x 10 5 Fl of DPPDA, 0.18 SDS sodium dodecyl sulfate and 0.05 M TRIS, at pH 8.5 yielded fluorescence counts of from about 1.36 to about 338, while solutions containinq 1 x 10 10 to 1 x 10 6 mole l DPPDA in excess 1 x 70 5 M EuCl3, in 0.05 M TRIS at pH 8.5 yielded counts of 0.073 to 47.3.The limit of detection of DPPDA in the presence of excess EuCl3 appeared to be 1 x 10 10 mole l.TADDA lanthanide solutionsA solution containing 1 x 10 6 X, TADDA and 1 x 10 5 M EuCl3 in 0.05 M carbonate buffer pH 10 was found to be fluorescent with excitation maxima at 364 nm and 383 nm and emission maximum at 619 nm. The fluorescence in acetate buffer pH 5 and CAPS buffer pH 10 is about one fourth the fluorescence intensity in carbonate pH 10. The fluorescence of the Eu TADDA solution is only 2.28 that of the Eu DPPDA solution carbonate buffer pH 10. It is suggested that the nitrogen atoms containing unsnared pairs of electrons, in the 9,14 positions of the TADDA molecule, cause a decrease of fluorescence intensity as compared with that of Eu DPPDA solutions.Preparation of Preferred Marker and other CompoundsThe intermediate compound 2,9 dimethyl 1,10 phenanthroline 5,6 quinone prepared in accordance with the reaction scheme given earlier may be chlorinated to form 2,9 bis trichloro methyl 1 ,10 phenanthroline 5,6 quinone which constitutes a useful precursor which is hydrolyzable to the final marker compound or dicarboxylic acid form, 1,10 phenanthroline 5,6quinone 2,9 dicarboxylic acid, in accordance with the reaction schemeEMI25.1 The bis diazonium and bis isothocyanato derivatives of DPPDA can be prepared through nitration of DPPDA to form dinitroDPPDA, hydrogenation of the dinitro DPPDA to diamino DPPDA and then diazotization of the diamino DPPDA with nitrous acid or reaction with thiophosgene to form the diazonium compound or the isothiocyanato compound, in accordance with the following reaction scheme EMI26.1 The bis succinamic acid derivative of DPPDA can be prepared by reaction of diamino DPPDA with succinic anhydride, in accordance with the following reaction scheme EMI27.1 The bis chlorosulfonylphenyl derivative of DPPDA can be prepared by direct chlorosulfonation of DPPDA in accordance with the following reaction scheme EMI27.2 Some non limiting Examples of methods of preparation of preferred marker and other compounds will now be given.Example 4 Synthesis of 2,9 bis trichloromethyl 1,10 phenan throline 5,6 quinone 2,9 dimethyl 1 ,10 phenanthroline 5,6 quinone hydrate, prepared as in Example 3b, was chlorinated according to the chlorination procedure described in Newkome et al, J.

The mixture was heated with stirring at 60 for 1 hr. The sulfonyl chloride dissolved gradually as it hydrolyzed to form a 1 mM solution of the disulfonate compound of the title sodium form . Formation of protein marker conjugatesThe preferred markers of the invention react through various mechanisms to couple covalently with immunoreactive or other proteins. For example, markers having as the functional groupX a diazonium group Y 2N can couple covalently with aromatic amino acid residues such as tyrosine and histidine residues present in the protein, and isothiocyanato groups readily couple covalently with amino groups present in proteins to form thioureas.Marker compounds having succinamic acid groups can couple covalently with protein amino groups through carbodiimide coupling. Since the carboxylic acid groups at the 2,9positions in the phenanthroline ring system may also react with amino groups present in proteins, it is desirable to conduct the coupling reactions in the presence of an agent which protects these carboxylic acid groups, for example a metal cation with which the acid groups from a chelate, such as europium or other lanthanide ion.The marker compound having sulfonyl halide groups are reactive toward lysine E amino groups and N terminal amino groups of proteins and covalent coupling of the marker occurs through sulfonamide formation. The best yields of labelled protein are achieved by adding the marker compound in a polar solvent, e.g. DMF, to a continuously stirred solution of the protein in an alkaline buffer solution, e.g. carbonate or borate buffer solution at pH 9.Some non limiting Examples of coupling of preferred marker compounds with proteins to form protein marker conjugates will now be given. Example 16 Attachment of DPPDA bis succinamic acid to bovine serum albuminTwo milliqrams of DPPDA bis succinamic acid 3.1 mmole ofExample 6 was suspended with stirring in 2.5 ml 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 4.8. Thirty microliters of 0.01 M EuCl3 solution 0.3 mmole and 2 mg BSA bovine serum albumin BSA 0.03 mmole were added. A solution containing 1.7 mg 0.1 mmole 1 3 dimethylaminopropyl 3 ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride EDC a water soluble condensing agent for formation of amides from carboxylic acids and amines in 0.5 ml water was added to the mixture with stirring. The conjugation was allowed to proceed with stirring for 4 hr at room temperature. The solution was then dialyzed against 0.05 M TRIS buffer pH 7.5.The dialysis solution was changed four times. The conjuqate solution was diluted to 25 ml to produce 80Vg ml labelled protein which was stored at 4 C with 0.02 sodium azide. When examined for fluorescence with a Perkin Elmer fluorometer non gated , solutions of the DPPDA bis succinamic acid labelled BSA exhibited fluorescence in the presence of excess europium with excitation maximum at 340 nm and emission maximum at 617 nm. Solutions of the labelled BSA ranging in concentration from about 2 ng ml up to 104 ng ml in 1 x 10 5 lf EuCl3 solution, 0.05 M TRIS pH 8.5, yielded fluorescence counts of from about 0.023 for the lowest concentration up to about 20.1 for the highest. The results indicated that a minimum concentration of about 1 ng ml labelled protein could be detected using a non gated fluorometer.Example 17 Protein labellinq with DPPDA bis chlorosulfonyl In a typical labelling experiment, 1 or 2 mg of an antigen or antibody BSA, mouse IgG, goat anti mouse IgG, or goat anti human IgG was dissolved in 2 ml carbonate buffer pH 9.DPPDA bisfchlorosulfonyl 0.4 or 0.8 mg, 100 equivalents was dissolved in 0.2 ml DXF which was dried over molecular sieves 4A and distilled. The resulting DMF solution was added dropwise to the continuously stirred antigen or antibody solution over a period of 5 min. The mixture was then stirred for 4 hr at room temperature in the dark to allow coupling to occur. Unbound excess reagent was removed by dialysis against four 800 nl portions of 0.05 M TRIS pH 7.5. In cases where a small amount of insoluble material was formed, the mixture was cenrifuged at 1500 rpm for 15 min and the precipitate was removed. The labelled antigen or antibody solution was stored at a concentration of 40 or 50 Vg ml in 0.05 M TRIS pH 7.5 containing 0.058 NaN3. A Bio Rad protein assay of the labelled protein solution using human IgG as standard showed that 70 100 of the proteins were usually recovered after labelling and dialysis. The Eio Ra protein assay reagent contains Coomassie Brilliant Blue G 250 which undergoes a shift in visible light absorption upon binding to proteins. The labelled antibody solutions were most fluorescent in the presence of europium in the pH range 9 10 in carbonate, borate, or 3 cyclohexylamino 1 propane sulfonic acid CAPS buffer. The labelled proteins in the presence of lanthanide ion exhibited excitation maxima at wavelengths above 300 nm and large Stokes shifts, typically of the order of 300 nm. For example, a solution containing 10 Vg ml labelled goat anti mouse IqG in the presence of 1 x 10 5 M EuCl3 in 0.05 M carbonate buffer pH 10, exhibited an excitation maximum at 330 nm and an emission maximum at 616 nm.Using the methods described above, the fluorescence counts of various proteins labelled with bis chlorosulfonyl DPPDA marker was determined using solutions of various concentrations in the ranges indicated in Table 2 below. In each case, a solution in 1 x 10 5 M EuC13 in 0.05 M carbonate buffer pH 10 was employed. The results were as indicated in Table 2 below.

A plot of log luminescence count against delay time was made and the fluorescence lifetime was found to be 700 Vs. This showed that the marker protein conjugate chelate was suitable for timeresolved fluorescence imnunoassay.Assay ProceduresThe accompanying drawings show graphs evaluating fluorescent immunoassay procedures described in more detail hereinafter, wherein each graph plots log fluorescent count against log concentrations of reagents used in the respective assay procedures, whereinFigures 1 and 2 are plots of fluorescent count against labelled mouse IgG antigen concentration Figure 3 is a plot of fluorescent count against mouse IgG concentration Figures 4 and 5 are plots of fluorescent count against humanIgG concentration and Figure 6 is a plot of fluorescent count against labelled BSA antigen concentration.Example 18 Immunofluorometric Assay of Labelled Mouse IgGThe immunological activity of a marker mouse IgG conjugate prepared as in Example 17 was tested in an immunoreaction between the labelled mouse IgG solutions of varying concentrations and goat anti mouse IgG coated on polystyrene cuvettes. Bovine serum albumin was used to prevent non specific binding and sodium dodecyl sulfate SDS was used to dissociate the antibody antigen complex after the immunoreaction. SDS causes the proteins to assume unnatural conformations, resulting in migration of the labelled antibody from the surface to the bulk of the solution. The result is a two thirds sandwich immunoassay.Two milliliters of 10 ug ml goat anti mouse IgG in 0.1 M carbonate buffer pH 9.5 was placed in each of ten 4 ml polystyrene fluorescence cuvettes Evergreen . Antibody coasting of the plastic surface was allowed to proceed overnight at 4 C. The coated cuvettes were washed twice with a saline solution containing 0.9 NaCl and 0.05 NaN3 and then allowed to stand at 4 C overnight with 4 ml of a solution containing 0.58 BSA, 0.05M TRIS buffer pH 7.7, 0.9 NaCl and 0.05 NaN3.After two washings with the saline solution, a 2 ml volume of a solution containing labelled mouse IgG in a buffer containing 0.58 BSA, 0.1 Tween 20, 0.05 M TRIS pH 7.7, 0.98 NaCl and 0.05 NaN3 was placed in each cuvette. Each cuvette received a solution containing a different concentration of the labelled mouseIgG. The concentrations of the labelled antigen ranged from 0.2 to 104 ng ml, as indicated by the points plotted in Figure 1. The labelled mouse IgG was prepared as described in Example 17, using DPPDA bis chlorosufonyl in a molar ratio of 100 1 to the mouse IgG. After gentle vortex mixing, the immunoreaction was allowed to proceed for 2 hr at room temperature. The labelled antigen solutions were aspirated and the cuvettes were washed three times with the saline solution.Two millimeters of 0.05 M carbonate solution pH 10 containing 0.1 SDS was then shaken in each cuvette to dissociate the antibody antigen complex. After 1 hr, 20 Vl of 0.001 M EuC13 0.01 M HCl solution was added to each cuvette, The solutions were shaken and the fluorescence counts were measured using a non gated Perkin Elmer 650 40 Fluorescence Spectrophotometer with ex 330 nm and Bem 615 nm and excitation and emission slits at 5 nm and 10 nm, respectively.The log fluorescence vs. log concentration dose response plot is shown in Figure 1. The detection limit for labelled mouseIgG appeared to be 10 ng ml.Example 19 Immunofluorometric Assay of Labelled Mouse IqGThe procedure of Example 18 was repeated using in place of the labelled mouse IgG solution a labelled mouse IgG solution prepared as described in Example 17 using bis chlorosulfonyl DPPDA in a molar ratio of 300 1 to the mouse IgG.The log fluorescence vs. log concentration dose response plot is shown in Figure 2. The detection limit for labelled mouseIgG appeared to be 1 ng ml.Example 20 Double Antibody Sandwich AssayA heterogeneous non competitive double antibody sandwich immunoassay was performed on mouse IgG using marker labelled goat anti mouse IgG. The key steps in the assay were as follows coating of polystyrene cuvettes with unlabelled goat antibody to mouse IgG coating of the polystyrene surface withBSA to prevent non specific adsorption incubation with the mouse IgG antigen incubation with the labelled goat antibody to mouse IgG dissociation of the immune complex with SDS and measurement of fluorescence in solution. One milliliter of a 10 çg ml goat antihofly to mouse IgG in 0.1M carbonate buffer pH 9.5 was placed in each of ten 4 mi polystyrene fluorescence cuvettes Evergreen . Antibody coating of the plastic surface was allowed to proceed overnight at 40C.After two washings with the saline solution, the cuvettes were coated with BSA 12 solution as described above in Example 19. The cuvettes were then washed twice with the saline solution and then allowed to stand for 2 hr at room temperature with 1 ml mouse IgG antigen solution in a buffer composed of 1 BSA, 0.1 Tween 20, 0.05 M TRIS pH 7.7, 0.9 NaCl and 0.05 NaN3. Each cuvette received a solution of different mouse IgG antigen concentration, ranging from 0.2 to 10 ng ml, as indicated by the points plotted in Figure 3. After removal of the antigen solutions by aspiration and two saline washings, 1 ml of 1000 nq ml marker labelled goat antibody to mouse IgG in the BSA Tween 20 TRIS NaCl NaN3 buffer was allowed to stand in the cuvettes for 2 hr after gentle vortex mixing.The markerlabelled antibody was prepared as described in Example 17, using a molar ratio of DPPDA bis chlorosulfonyl DPPDA to the antibody of 100 1. After aspiration of the labelled second antibody solution, 1 ml of 0.18 SDS in 0.05 M carbonate buffer pH 10 was shaken in each cuvette to dissociate the immunological complex. After 1 hr, 10 ul of 0.001 M EuCl3 0.01 ld HCl solution was added with vortex mixing. The fluorescence at Xex 330 nm and Xem 615 nm, excitation slit at 5 nm and emission slit at 10 nm, was measured using the non gatedPerkin Elmer 650 40 Fluorescence Spectrophotometer, and the dose response plot shown in Figure 3 was obtained. The limit of detection for this assay was about 50 ng ml. Example 21 Double Antibody Sandwich AssayThe procedure of Example 20 was repeated using human IgG in place of mouse IgG and goat antibody to human IgG in place of the goat antibody to mouse IgG. The incubation of the coated cuvettes was conducted with solutions of human IgG having concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 104 ng ml, as indicated by the points plotted in Figure 4. The marker labelled goat anti body to human lgG was prepared as described in Example 9 usina a molar ratio of bis chlorosulfonyl DPPDA to goat anti humanIgG of 100 1, in carbonate buffer p l 9 at room temperature.The dose response plot obtained is shown in Figure 4. The limit of detection for immunoglobulins was about 5 ng ml. In comparison, the limit of detection for immunoglobulins in heterogeneous fluorescent immunoassay using conventional fluorophores, such as fluorescein and rhodamine derivatives, is 200 ng ml.Example 22 Double Antibody Sandwich AssayThe procedure of Example 21 was repeated using marker labelled goat antibody to human IgG prepared as described in Example 9, using a molar ratio of bis chlorosulfonyl DPPDA to goat antihuman IgG of 200 1 and modified in that the coupling reaction was performed in borate buffer pH 9 in an ice bath.The dose response plot obtained is shown in Figure 5. The limit for detection was about 5 ng ml.Fluorescence of DPPDA DisulfonateDPPDA disulfonate prepared as in Example 15 forms an intee ly fluorescent chelate with europium III chloride in aqueous solution with excitation and emission maxima at 330 and 617 nm, respectively. The fluorescence of the DPPDA disulfonateeuropium solution in carbonate buffer pH 10 is about 2 greater than the fluorescence. of DPPDA europium solution in the same buffer and is linear over five orders of magnitude concentration range. A minimum concentration of 3 x 10 11 M DPPDA disulfonate in the presence of 1 x 10 5 EuC13 could be detected using a non gated Perkin Elmer 650 40 Fluorescence Spectrophotometer. Higher sensivitity can be obtained with the use of a gated time resolved fluorometer. The DPPDA disulfonate compound was found to exhibit no ligand sensitized fluorescence in the presence of terbium III , samarium III and dysprosium III salts.
