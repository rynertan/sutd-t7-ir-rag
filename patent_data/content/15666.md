# Apparatus for controlling electrical power consumption.

## Abstract
In an electrical power distribution system, a consumer has a control unit 42 comprising a plurality of solid state switches 43 in supply leads 44 to a plurality of sepa rate load circuits, a microprocessor 41 responsive to the magnitude of the total current drawn by the consumer from the supply and arranged to control the various swit ches 43 so as to limit the total current or power in ac cordance with a priority program set into the microproces sor. The consumer can thus control the manner of use of the supplied power within a maximum demand limit. This overall maximum demand limit may be predetermined in accordance with an agreed supply tariff or may be remotely controlled by the utility. Preferably two microprocessors 17, 41 with associated control switches 19, 43 are employed, one 17 being controlled by the utility and being associated with or forming part of the energy con sumption metering unit 17, 29 and serving to limit the maximum demand and the other 41 being programmed by the consumer to control priority of supplies to individual load circuits 44 .
