# Programmable controller PC with improved boolean processor.

## Abstract
A very fast and efficient Boolean processor BP 20 capable of compiling a full range of diagrams or expressions in ladder, logigram, and Boolean with a small but powerful instruction set. The BP includes an instruction decoder 34 , combinatoric logic 35 , a T register 42 which holds the temporary results of a sequential AND operation, an N register 43 which holds the initial Boolean value of T, a Binary Accumulator Memory BAM 40 which is used as a scratchpad for a program which evaluates a ladder or logigram diagram or a Boolean expression, a source address S in BAM 40 from which an initial operand is taken, a destination address D in BAM 40 in which the result of an operation is stored, and a destination address register DAR 45 in which the destination address is stored. The instruction set includes a subset of input instructions and a subset of structure instructions. The operand I of an input instruction is an address in IOIM 25 . The operands S,D of a structure instruction are source and destination addresses in BAM 40 . Each input instruction reads the value of a bit from IOIM and has the effect of logically combining this bit value with the value held in the T register and possibly with the destination bit in BAM. The structure instructions cause operation on the pair of addresses S and D, and either describe the structure of the diagram to be compiled or permit the performance of logical functions between nodes in the diagram.
