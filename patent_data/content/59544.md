# Friction welding.

## Abstract
A method of, and apparatus for, friction welding two components such as universal joint members to the ends of a shaft, wherein the shaft is held stationary while the components are rotated against its ends to produce welding conditions, and then released as welding pressure is applied while the components are braked. Allowing the shaft to rotate with the end component during formation of the welds avoids weld quality problems occurring due to the formation and tearing apart of a succession of welds during the time which would be taken for the end components to come to rest if the shaft were held stationary.
