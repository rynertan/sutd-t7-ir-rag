# Method for regulating the working time of materials for taking impressions.

## Abstract
In order to make it possible to regulate at will the mixing time and working time of materials for taking impressions, for example dental impressions, or to neutralise the acceler ating effect on the mixing and working time of impression materials due to increases in the temperature of the working environment and or increase in the hardness of the water used for mixing, a suitable regulator is added in a selected quantity at the time of preparation of the mixture. The mixture already comprises a retarder of predetermined quantity. Where a tribasic alkaline orthophosphate or equiva lent retarder is present, a regulator is added consisting of a lithium salt, such as chloride, nitrate, perchlorate, sulphate or carbonate.

## Description
METHOD FOR REGULATING THE WORKING TIME OF MATERIALS FOR TAKING IMPRESSIONS The present invention relates to a method of preparing a material for taking an impression comprising mixing an alginate based material with water to produce a viscous mass. The invention particularly relates to matorials for taking dental impressions, in particular to those based on alginates, and commonly known under the name of Alginates , which have the following main components, which are in the fine powder state a a water soluble alginate for example sodium or potas sium alginate b a slightly water soluble calcium salt for example sulphate, tartrate, citrate c an inert material such as diatomaceous earth d a setting retarder for example phosphates of alkaline metals in their various forms, EDTA salts . A mixture, in suitable proportions, of the components a , b , c , d with water provides a viscous mass which can be moulded, stretched and generally kneaded for a time which is longer the greater the percentage of the retarder d . The mix then sets and provides a mass dmrac terised by high elasticity qualities.This viscous mass is the material used in the dental profession for obtaining impressions of the oral cavity, of the denture or of a part thereof, and for obtaining impressions for duplicating patterns. The elasticity of the product after setting makes it easy to detach the impression from the denture or from the pattern without breakage or substantial deformation, and enables undercuts to be incorporated. All the aforesaid impression materials are characterised by their mixing time, their working time, and their setting time. The mixing time indicates the time necessary for making the mixture of powder and water homogeneous by working it with a spatula. For reasons of practical application this must not exceed one minute, but cannot be reduced to too short a time in order not to compromise the homogeneousness of the mixture, and consequently in order not to compromise the perfection of the impression. The working time comprises both the mixing time and the time which the operator has available for filling the impression carrying scoop and for carrying out all the operations which precede the application of the material to the patient s mouth. The setting time indicates the period between the commencement of mixing and the completion of setting. In other words, the setting time corresponds to the sum of the working time and the time for which it remains in the patient s mouth. A knowledge of the working time is of particular importance for the correct use of impression materials. If the working time is longer than that scheduled, the patient suffers considerable discomfort, being thus compelled to support a more or less running viscous mass in the mouth. Vomit inducing stimuli in such cases are not infrequent. If the working time is shorter than scheduled, the materials sets before use it sets in the hand and must be thrown away. Unfortunately, the working time cannot be evaluated previously.Not even the manufacturer is able to supply precise data, because this depends largely on the ambient temperature at the time of use, and the hardness of the water used for mixing. In this respect, this time becomes shorter as the temperature and or hardness of the water increase, and in contrast it increases substantially as the temperature reduces and or water low in calcium salts is used. Exact knowledge of the mixing time and working time has been attained by introducing special chromatic phase indicators into the impression material. These indicators are constituted by colouring substances which change colour in relation to the attainment of a particular stage in the reaction process preceding setting, and they thus provide an extemporaneous indication of the effective mixing time and working time whatever the temperature of the powder and water, and whatever the hardness of the water, the evaluation being available at any moment during the varl ous operations. The introduction when using 7lA1ginates of chromatic phase indicators has brilliantly solved the problem of knowing the mixing and working times. however, if these are too long or too short, it is not possible to act in order to vary them. This has caused many manufacturers whether they use chromatic indication or not to make the same product available to operators in two different types, namely rapid setting and normal setting. The former is more suitable for the winter period or in relatively cold environmental situations, while the latter is more suitable for the summer period or in distinctly warm environmental situations. This solution to the problem is only partial, and itself leads to other non negligible drawbacks in terms of production, distribution and use. The problem could be held to be satisfactorily solved only if the operator is provided with the possibility of regulating at will the working time of the alginate in relation to the environment in which he works, and in relation to the water which he uses. This is attainable by the method according to the invention. The method makes it possible to regulate at will the mixing time and working time of materials for taking dental impressions, or alternatively serves for neutralising the accelerating effect which an increase in the working environment temperature and or the hardness of the water used for mixing have on the mixing and working time of alginate based materials, and consists substantially of using a suitable regulator able to regulate the mixing and working times, and being introduced into the mixture, at the moment of use, in a quantity sufficient for the required regulation, in order to regulate the mixing and working times and to facilitate the carr mng out of all operations which precede the application of alginate based masses to the patient s mouth for taking impressions, whatever the ambient temperature and or whatever the hardness of the water used. In one embodiment of said method, the regulator used is a setting retarder1 which can be the same retarder as that already present in the material itself, and is added extemporaneously to the impression material at the moment of use. During the daily work of the professional practitioner, the required regulation of the working time can be carried out at the moment of preparation of the mixture of water and alginate, by adding in controlled quantities small suitable amounts of a retarder in the solid state to a rapid setting alginate in powder form, or small quantities of soluble retarder, either in the liquid phase or in solution, to the water. The retarder in powder, tablet, solution or other form can be provided directly by the manufacturer, either together with or without the alginate pack. As stated heretofore, the retarders are suitably chosen by the alginate manufacturer for addition in controlled quantities to the powder or water at the moment of use. Advantageously, the regulator arranged to regulate the mixing and working times, and introduced into the mixture at the moment of use in a quantity suitable for the required regulation can be constituted by a lithium salt such as chloride, nitrate, perchloride, sulphate, carbonate, etc. This method is particularly suitable for addition to alginatebased impression materials comprising a tribasic alkaline orthophosphate retarder or the like. The lithium salt can be made available in the solid state for adding to the impression material powder, or in a soluble solid state or in solution for adding to the water used for mixing, in quantities controllable at will. It has been shown experimentally that lithium salts, when introduced in small quantities into alginates of which the retarder consists mainly of tribasic alkaline orthophosphate, increase the effectiveness of said retarder for the entire period of its action.The lithium cation acts in an exclusively physical manner on the kinetics of the reactive processes which lead to setting1 thus modifying the diffusion layer which controls the transfer of the calcium ions from the surface of the crystals, for example of calcium sulphate, to the solution. The lithium salts do not alter the stoichiometric balance of the reactions which are concluded by setting. For this reason they have no negative action on the physical properties of the mass which forms the impression. The lithium salts can thus be considered as specific controllers of the working time, in that they do not in any way affect the time of application or the resting time in the patient s mouth. This is a further positive effect of their use, given that the resting time in the mouth being practically uninfluenced by the temper Nature of the environment in which mixing is carried out requires no regulation, and in fact should be as short as possible. The required regulation of the working time during the profes sional practitioner s daily activity can be carried out at the moment of preparing the mixture of water and alginate, by adding, in controlled quantity, shall suitable amounts of a lithium salt in the solid state any lithium salt can be used to the rapid setting Alginate in powder forms, or small doses of the lithium salt in tablet form or in solution to the water. The lithium salt in powder, tablet, solution or other form can be supplied directly by the manufacturer, either together with or without the Alginate pack. The invention can be effected with any modification with respect to the aforegoing, but which falls within the following claims.
