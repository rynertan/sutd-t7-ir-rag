# A MODULAR HOLDER FOR TWO DIMENSIONAL ELEMENTS

## Abstract
A holder for substantially two dimensional elements such as floppy disks, phonograph records, cards and the like comprising a case or main body 1 in which an extractable supporting structure 2 enclosing a plurality of such two dimensional elements is housed. The supporting structure 2 includes a frame portion or base 4 restrained to the main body 1 and a holding portion or basket 3 for the two dimensional elements that can accomplish at least an angular displacement with respect to the base in order to allow an easy visual check of the two dimensional elements without extracting them from the holder. The holders are furthermore provided with side members 9 for the connec tion to other adjacent holders so as to form a library arrangement having minimal transverse dimensions. The rotation of the basket after that the supporting structure 2 has been extracted allows for a quick and easy inspection of the content of one or more baskets without substantially increasing the dimensions of the library.
