# Radiation curable cellulose coating.

## Abstract
Ethylenically unsaturated cellulose esters are provided. These ethylenically unsaturated cellulose esters are the reaction product of a cellulose ester having unreacted hydroxyl groups and a polymerizable ethylenically unsatu rated compound having an isocyanato group reactive with the hydroxyl groups of the cellulose ester. The product is substantially free of unreacted isocyanate groups and is particularly useful in protective coatings.
