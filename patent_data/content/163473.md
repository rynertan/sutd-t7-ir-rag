# ELECTRICAL CONNECTOR

## Abstract
An electrical connector member includes a cylindrical outer shell 1 which encloses a bonded insulating insert assembly 2 having a plurality of axial passages 7 for electrical contacts. The insert assembly includes a rigid main insert 3 , a rigid wafer 4 , a rubber grommet 6 and a rubber seal 5 . The shell has an internal shoulder 8 which provides a stop for a collar 9 provided on the insert 3 . A dish shaped resilient beryllium copper retention ring 11 having a plurality of axially directed slots 12 is placed in an internal annular recess 10 in the shell before the insert assembly is inserted into the shell. When the insert assembly is inserted, the smaller diameter edge 16 of the retention ring slides over the collar 9 until, on full insertion, the edge 16 snaps firmly against the shoulder 14 of the collar. The insert is then firmly supported in the shell by the spring force of the retention ring and requires no encapsulation.
