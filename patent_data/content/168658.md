## Description
PYRROLECARBOXYLIC ACID DERIVATIVE HAVING ANALGESIC ACTIVITY PREPARATION THEREOF AND COMPOSITIONS THEREFROM The present invention refers to 5 4 fluoro benzo yl 1,2,4 trimethyl 3 pyrrolcarboxylic acid having formulaEMI1.1 and its non toxic salts with inorganic cations or deriving from organic bases or aminoacids. Another object of the invention is provided by a process for preparing the compound I. A further object of the invention is provided by pharmaceutical composition having analgesic activity comprising, as the active principle, the compound of formulaI or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Pyrrolacetic acid derivatives endowed with analgesic activity are known from DE A 2,102,746. In particular, 5 p chlorobenzoyl 1, 4 dimethylpyrrole 2 acetic acid, also known as zomepirac, proved to be an effective analgesic agent and it is presently used in human therapy. A major problem connected with the clinical use of zomepirac, is due to its capacity of inhibiting the enzymes cyclooxygenase and prostaglandine synthetase. As a result of this enzymatic inhibition, zomepirac, as well as other analgesic antiinflammatory agents, exhibits ulcerogenic properties and may induce anaphylactoid reactions as a consequence of the formation of leukotrienes. The compound I which, differently from zomepirac, is a pyrrolcarboxylic acid derivative instead of a pyrrolacetic acid derivative, is surprisingly devoid of cyclooxygenase and prostaglandine synthetase inhibiting activity and it is therefore devoid of ulcerogenic and anaphylactoid properties. Moreover, the compound of the invention does not induce addiction effects, differently from other centrally acting analgesics and particularly from the opioid analgesics morphine, codeine, etc. . According to the present invention the compound of formula I may be conveniently prepared according to the following reaction scheme EMI2.1 The mono saponification of the diester II with equimolar amounts of sodium hydroxide in aqueous isopropanol occurs selectively and with good yields at the carboxymethyl group linked in position 2 of the pyrrole nucleus. The reaction course is unequivocally confirmed by the NMR spectrum of compound I, which clearly shows the presence of a methyl group in position 2 of the pyrrole ring. The following example illustrates the invention without limiting the scope thereof. EXAMPLE a l,4 Dimethyl 5 4 fluorobenzoyl 3 ethoxycarbonylpyrro le 2 acetic acid III 56.25 Grams 0.15 moles of ethyl 1,4 dimethyl 5 4 fluorobenzoyl 3 ethoxycarbonylpyrrole 2 acetate were suspended in 300 ml of an isopropanol water 80 20 mixture. The reaction mixture was refluxed and 75 ml 0.15 moles of a 2N sodium hydroxide aqueous solution was added dropwise thereto, during 30 minutes. The reflux was kept for 1 hour, the isopropanol was distilled off, the mixture was diluted with water, acidified with HC1 and extracted several times with ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate solution was concentrated and cooled, obtaining the crystallization of 43 g 82.68 yield of a product having m.p. 159 161 C. b 5 4 Fluorobenzyl 1,2,4 trimethyl 3 pyrrolecarboxylic acid I 30 Grams 0.0864 moles of the product obtained in a were heated to 2000C for 3 hours in nitrogen stream.After cooling, the residue was taken up with 100 ml of ethanol and 100 ml of 15 sodium hydroxide aqueous solution and the mixture was refluxed for 3 hours. The ethanol was evaporated, water was added to the mixture, the aqueous solution was heated at 600C and strongly acidified with hydrochloric acid. After cooling, the precipitated crude acid was filtered, washed with water, dried and crystallized from ethyl acetate, obtaining 19 g 80 yield of a product melting at 197 198 C. The analgesic activity of the compound of formula I by the oral route, has been determined in the mouse using the following tests Phenylquinone test Hendershot and Forsaith J. Pharma col. Exptl. Ther. 123, 237 1959 Hot plate test. Male albino mice, treated with increas ing doses of the compound under exam, are placed on a plate thermostatized at 550C. An effective dose 50 ED50 is defined as the dose inducing a 50 increase of the reaction time to the pain stimulus. The acute toxicity per os is expressed as LD50 at the 14 observation day. 50 As a comparison codeine hydrochloride was used. The results are reported in the following Table. TABLE IEMI4.1 tb SEP Phenylquinone SEP Hot SEP place SEP LD50 mouse SEP Os SEP tb SEP ED50 SEP mg kg SEP EX50 SEP mg kg SEP mg kg tb SEP SO SEP tb Compound SEP I SEP 2.1 SEP 3.5 SEP 1600 tb Codeine SEP HC1 SEP 5.6 SEP 25 SEP 300 tb The compound of formula I, differently from codeine hydrochloride, does not induce the phenomenon known as jumping by nalorphine in the mouse, which rules out the possibility of provoking physical addiction.Moreover, the compound I unequivocally differentiates from known compo unds having similar structure, such as zomepirac, in that it is endowed with central analgesic activity without cyclooxygenase and prostaglandine synthetase inhibitory activity, with the consequent and above mentioned advantages. An essential aspect of the invention is provided by pharmaceutical formulations containing predetermined amount of compound I, useful for the treatment of acute and chronic pain of different nature, particularly deriving from neoplasias, surgical operations, head ache, tooth ache etc. The compound of the present invention can be administered by the oral, rectal or parenteral route, for instance in form of capsules, coated tablets, tablets, syrups, drops, suppositories, microclisms, phials. The following formulations are cited by way of an example a tablets containing from 25 to 500 mg of the compound I, with excipients and disgregating agents commonly used in the pharmaceutical technique b suppositories containing from 50 to 1000 mg of compound I c vials for intramuscular or endovenous use containing from 25 to 500 mg of compound I, in form of a salt thereof, at a pH of about the physiological values.
