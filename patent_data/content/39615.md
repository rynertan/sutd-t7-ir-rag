## Description
A clamping device BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to a device for clamping together two members which may meet at a variety of angles.A number of clamping methods are in use, but often require fairly involved workshop procedures to prepare components for the task, especially where the members to be connected meet at unusual angles.Tolerances in the manufacture of plates and the drilling of bolt holes are often critical. Further, in some bolted connections, access to all sides of the connection may be necessary for the threading of nuts, or the insertion of bolts..OBJECT OF THE INVENTIONIt is an object of the invention to provide a clamping device which may be used in a variety of situations, and which is simple in manufacture and operation.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONAccording to the invention a device for clamping together first and second members in abutting relationship comprises a first clamping element with a stud protruding from it for reception in a hole in the first member, and means engageable between the first clamping element and a formation on the second member to draw and hold the members together. Further according to the invention the formation is a second clamping element formed with a stud protruding from it for reception in a hole in the second member. Alternatively, the formation may be a hole in the second member engageable by the drawing and holding means.The drawing and holding means is preferably a screw which can pass through a hole in an element or a formation and which can be engaged in a threaded hole a ssociated with the other clamping element or formation, as the case may be.In the preferred form of the invention the or each clamping element isL shaped with a stud depending from one leg of the L and with a hole or threaded hole in the other leg of the L.Also according to the invention the or each stud is headed and. the corresponding hole is undercut for the head of the stud to engage under a lip. In the case of tubular members the drilling of a hole provides an automatic undercut.The device of the invention is particularly useful for joining square tubes together.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF HE DRAWINGS Figure shows a view of a clamping device according to the invention.Figures 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 show various applications of the clamping device, figure 6 being a view in the direction of the arrow 6 in Figure 5.Figure 7 shows a clamping device in use for connecting two panels in edge to edge relationship.Figure 8 shows a clamping device having a single clamping element in use for connecting two panels at right angles to each other.DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENTAs shown in Figure 1, a clamping device has a first clamping element 10, and a second clamping element 12. Each clamping element is a short length of angle iron, and each has a stud 14 protruding from one leg of the angle iron. An Allen screw 16 passes loosely through an aperture 18 in the first clamping element 10, and engages with a threaded hole in the second clamping element 12.The studs 14are headed, as shown in Figure 1, for engagement of the studs in holes in hollow square sections. The operation of the clamping device is described with reference to Figure 2, in which two square tubular members 20 and 22 are connected in end to end relationship.The members 20 and 22 are placed loosely in end to end relationship, and studs 24 and 26 are located in holes in the members 20 and 22 respectively. The Allen screw 28 is engaged with the hole 30 in the clamping element 32, thereby bringing the studs 24 and 26 closer together, clamping the members 20 and 22 to one another.Suitable shims may be placed in the space 34 between the clamping elements 32 and 36, should the ends 38 and 40 of the clamping elements lift during the turning of the Allen screw 28.The connection of the members 20 and 22 may be strengthened by the provision of a second clamping device 42.Figures 3 and 4 show clamping devices in use for the connection of members meeting at an angle. Again each connection may be strengthened by the provision of a further clamping device on the far side.Figures 5 and 6 demonstrate the versatility of the invention. In this case, two members 44 and 46 meet in a crossed relationship, and the clamping element 48 or 52 has been turned through a right angle with respect to the clamping element 50 or 54 .Figure 7 shows a single clamping device 56 in use for connecting two panels 58 and 60, where access to only one side of the panels is possible or desirable. A sealed joint may be formed between the panels 58 and 60 by the provision of a strip of a suitable elastomer 62, which is compressed during the turning of the Allen screw 64.Figure 8 shows an alternative embodiment of the invention where a single clamping element 66 is used to join two panels 68 and 70, at an angle. A stud 72 is inserted into a hole in the panel 70, and theAllen screw 74 is passed through a hole in the clamping element, and is engaged with a threaded hole in the panel 68. Turning of theAllen screw brings the panels 68 and 70 towards each other. Again, a sealed connection may be obtained by the provision of a strip 76 of a suitable elastomer. The invention thus provides a clamping device which finds application in the jointing of members meeting at a variety of angles. The members may meet in the same plane, or may be in crossed relationship.Further, figures 7 and 8 illustrate applications of the invention where access to only one side of the members is desirable.In all cases, the clamping device is simple and quick to use, and it will be appreciated that a degree of flexibility in the positioning of holes or in the members can be tolerated.
