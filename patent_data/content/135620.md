## Description
Horizontal Honing Machine.The invention relates to a horizontal honing machine for working up cilindrical bores, for which a very good quality of the worked surface and a high accuracy of measure are required, such as for example are required for cilinder walls of hydraulic and pneumatic installations.The honing activity is effected by means of strips of grinding material, placed upon the circumference of a dilatatable bearer honing head , which is moved simultaneously axially and rotationally by a sled in the bore whereby a spiral grinding process in both directions to and fro is taking place. Thus the polishing grooves are formed in a crosswise manner.In order to obtain an exactly parallel bore, the reversal motion of the axial drive is most critical.Any slackening of speed or stagnation of the axial motion with regard to the continuously rotating motion will cause a local increase of grinding off more material, such that the bore will become locally wider.Horizontal honing machines with a sled for large stroke lengths of 1000 mm up to 10.000 mm are known, wherein the axial drive of the sled is carried out either hydraulically or electromechanically.The disadvantage of a hydraulic drive of the sled is the fact that this requires an excess of installed power, in order to be enabled to deliver the power peak for fast reversal.Consequently, the output efficiency of the hydraulic drive is poor.The disadvantages of the known electromechanical drives of the sled are the changing over time, which is too long, and the inertia momentum of the moving accessories, resulting in a reversal motion, which is too slow.Both systems show a less accurate reversal point mainly at high speed, which means that the honing process cannot be carried out with the optimal speed. To a major extent this applies to the honing of blind bores.Therefore a solution was investigated to remove these advantages,A thorough research resulted in a machine, with which the above disadvantages are obviated to a considerable extent.The horizontal honing machine with driven sled for large and small stroke lengths, comprising a frame with a guiding bar and with a linearly driven sled with a motor for the rotatory motion of the honing head is characterized according to the subject invention, in that the drive of said sled is moved by a direct current motor with servo control and solidstate transistor adjustment, whereby the speed and the reversal point of the motion of the sled in the stroke are almost independant from the load and are accurately repeating.For said controlling three systems are appropriate.The controlling can be effected by means of a threephase thyristor convertor.With this a three phase alternating tension is rectified, whereby the pulsefrequency ranges from 150 300 Hz.The controlling can also be effected by a direct current transistor regulator in combination with a brushless synchrone motor having permanent magnets at the rotor and coils at the stator.The current fed to the coils is electronically commuted.The preferred embodiment is a transistor with pulse width modulation.With this device the alternating tension is first rectified and subsequently equably chopped.The tension at the rotor collector connections is influenced by varying the width of the pulses.The frequency of the pulses ranges from about 1000 to 10.000 Hz.With this device a motor with permanent magnet and a built in tacho generator is used.In this manner the driving power is provided by a closed circuit for speed regulation having short reaction periods.Thereby the set speed and the reversal of the motion are independent from load and very accurate.The switching over of the servo control can be effected by a sequence of signals which are introduced according to a preset programme for continuous production tasks.The axial speed during the honing process ranges between about 10 and 40 mimin. The power drive used in accordance with the invention renders the possibility to retard the sled with the honing head at an axial speed of 30 mimin, to effect the reversal without perceptible standstill and to bring it to the set speed in the reverse direction again within 1 3 second.A second advantage of the drive according to the invention is the feature that with an equally remaining adjustment of the speed of the axial motion a very accurately set point of reversal of the sled is obtained, which is practically independent from the axial load and which will be repeated continually with exactness.This is of great importance in practice, for example for the honing of bores with blind bottoms.It appeared to be possible to make use of the optimal speed of the sled also for the honing of blind bores and in this respect to hone even at a distance of 2 to 3 mm only from the bottom.The power installed for the drive is 15 kW at the utmost.The drive is delivering only the power which is to be used at any moment.During the reversal the peak charge to drag and to start running up is consumed and during the further uniform speed of the stroke only the power for the motion of the honing head through the piece of work is consumed.Therefore the total efficiency of the electrical drive is becoming higher than that of conventional systems.The drive with control according to the invention enables to make the reversal of the sled accurately also in case of high axial speed 40m min , so that during the honing of blind bores the optimal speed can be applied.The servomotor has a low inertia momentum and it can endure the high strengths of current during short periods which are necessary for the start of running up and for the dragging operations.Because of these high speeds obtainable with the said drive the machine is also appropriate for honing by means of novel cutting materials, such as boron nitride The use of boron nitride is described i.a. in Werkstatt und Betrieb , Ed. Hanser,116, 1983 ,nr.6, p.399 a.f. .The invention is further elucidated on the basis of the enclosed drawings 1 and 2.Figure 1 shows in part a schematic cros section of the installation according to the invention.Therein 1 is the servomotor, 2 a tachogenerator, 3 a reductor, 4 the sled, 5 the motor for the rotatory drive, 6 the honing head with the honing stone 7 in the piece of work 8 . Figure 2 shows schematically the electrical control circuit of the installation. 1 is the servomotor, 2 the tachogenerator, 9 a potentiometer, 10 aReed relay, 11 a gradient generator, 12 a servo amplifier, 13 an internaurrent circuit.The servomotor 1 has low inertia momentum and it can endure high currents during short periods, which are necessary for start and dragging.The tachogenerator 2 is mounted upon the shaft of the servomotor 1 .The reductor 3 has a low inertia momentum too and its construction is with inconsiderable play.At the console for the operator of the device a potentiometer 9 is mounted, which delivers a tension linearly proportional with the angle of adjustment.This adjusted value is switched over to the servo amplifier 12 by means of the Reed relay 10 with mercury contacts, which have a switching delay of about 2 milliseconds.The signal of the adjusted value is fed into the gradient generator 11 , which transforms a non linear signal into a value of tension including or declining linearly with time, and thus provides for uniformly accelerating start and uniformly retarded dragging respectively of the motor 1 .The tachogenerator 2 at the shaft of the motor 1 delivers a tension increasing linearly with speed of rotation and the polarity of which depends from the direction of rotation.This signal of the tachogenerator pursuant to the gradient generator ll is compared with the adjusted value.The servoamplifier 12 controls the current and the tension for the motor 1 in such a manner, that the measured signal of the tachogenerator is consistent with the adjusted value, whereby the control circuit for the rate of speed is closed. If the axial speed of the motor 1 would alter as a consequence of the forces of honing and of mass, the system will instantaneously react and deliver a tension and a rotatory moment appropriate to reduce the speed into the previous situation.An internal current circuit 13 is added to provide for a feed back signal in order to obtain a precise adjustment of the rotatory moment.The drive renders the possibility to enable the sled and all the accessories connected with it as well as the honing equipment to move to and fro, with a speed of 40 mimin. The sled shall stop in it at the end of the stroke flexibly and accurately reaccelerate without noticeable standstill.The stroke depth is about 10.000 mm.The displacement length is about 13.000 mm.With a speed in the stroke of 30 mimin which occurs quite often, each the dragging and the accelerating distances should not be in excess of 40 mm.The following calculation demonstrates the favourable results with sled speeds up to 40 m min.Calculations for the frequently used speed of 30 mimin and with a dragging distance of 40 mm are as follows Weight of the sled, rotating drive included, total 178 kgWeight of driving chain 59 kgWeight of cable leads and cables 57 kgHoning equipment, up to 30 kgMass in motion to and fro total 324 kg.Efficiency of the sled guidance ball bearings n 90 Reductor retardation factor 6 11.0 mass inertia momentum 3 1.971. 10 4 Kgm2 yield 92 divider circle of chain wheel dip. 0.152 m.Permanent magnet motor pos. 1, with tachogenerator mass inertia momentum 12 0.026 kgm2 strength of current taken up 1.22 Amp Nm current peak, max. 140 Amp max. continuous torque 30 Nm.Servo amplifier strength of current, admissible of short duration 50 Amp.strength of current continually chargeable at 100 V tension at motor 32 Amp.

Circumferential speed Vru 52 m minSpeed in the stroke 30 and 40 mlmin see tables.The results of the experiments are reported in the tables I and II.Measurements have been made with gauge with 0.01 mm divided scale and 5 mm stroke depth.The values of results of runs 2,5,6,7 and 8 have been rounded off to 0.05 mm, the values of runs 9,10 and 11 have been rounded off to 0.1 mm.Measurements have been made under different load conditions and at two successive days in order to examine the influences of prolonged standstill periods and of cooling down.From the first run until after run 8 no adjustment whatsoever of the machine had been altered.For the augmentation of the speed in the stroke from 30 to 40 m min the gauge has been displaced because then the running out distance of the sled was longer.With a speed in the stroke of 30 mlmin the measured spread of the point of reversal was 2.21 mm at the highest, while the load of the honing force was varying from 0 to 1.02 kW.With a stroke speed of 30 m min and the same load the measured spread was 0.7 mm.When the stroke speed was augmented to 40 mimic, the spread values were the same as with a speed of 30 m min.The augmentation of the rotational load is resulting from the increase of the speed in the stroke.From the experimental runs and the measured values it appears that with the machine according to the invention an important progress with respect to the known systems of construction has been attained.
