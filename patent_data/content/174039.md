# Speed control for weft feed spool in weaving looms.

## Abstract
A method to control the speed of the weft feed spool in weaving looms, characterized by the fact that it consists of feeding at least two items of detected data into a control mechanism, the use of these data by this latter to calculate, as a number of windings, the variation R of the reserve from the average reserve which itself is determined by the reserve sensor B , and any appropriate adjustment which may be required of the speed of the feed spool.
