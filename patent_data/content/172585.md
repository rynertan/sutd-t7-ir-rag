# BUCKLE

## Abstract
A molded plastic buckle is formed with a male member having two opposed flexible arms which are self guiding upon insertion into sized channels formed in the female member, whereupon insertion, the self guided arms lock into the female member. A novel elliptical web adjustment and securing bar is provided on the male member. The present buckle construction eliminates the guide bar of the prior art construction, improves web holding, and reduces the overall weight of the buckle, while maintaining desired strength characteristics.
