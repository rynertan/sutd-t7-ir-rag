# Underwater acoustic wave transmitting and receiving unit.

## Abstract
An underwater acoustic wave transmitting and receiving unit has a plate shaped polarized piezoelectric resonator formed of at least one plate 11 made of a complex of fluo rosilicon rubber and lead titanate. The resonator is sealed in a rubber casing 31,32 filled with an insulating liquid 5 matching, in acoustic impedance, water in which the unit is to be submerged.
