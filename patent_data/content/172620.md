# Gun sighting arrangement.

## Abstract
A gun sighting arrangement in which a telescope 11 is mounted on the gun barrel 1 and is pre aligned with the gun barrel and the normal gunnery sight 9 on a standard distance target. Relative movement between the gun muzzle and the normal gunnery sight 9 , due, for example, to shock displacement of the sight or temperature distortion of the barrel, causes an error in barrel target alignment when the gunnery sight 9 is on target. This error has two components a between gunnery sight sightline and barrel mounting, due to shocks etc and b between barrel mounting and muzzle, due to wear, temperature distortion of the barrel etc. Both of these effects can be compensated by mounting the telescope 11 at the muzzle end of the barrel 1 . Muzzle displacement due to either effect causes displacement of the target image in the telescope 11 , which is produced by flashing the target with the standard range finding laser. The displacement indicates the alignment error. Partial compen sation can be provided by mounting the telescope 11 at the barrel mounting 14 and otherwise taking account of basic distortion.
