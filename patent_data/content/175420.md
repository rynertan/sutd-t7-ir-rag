# Multiple programmable initialize words in a programmable read only memory.

## Abstract
In accordance with this invention, a programmable read only memory 30 is provided which is capable of storing a plurality of initialize words. The memory includes an initialize input lead 9 and appropriate addressing circuitry 7 so that when the appropriate initialize input signal is placed on the initialize input lead, one of several pre programmed initialize words is placed in the output register 6 of the programmable read only memory. The word that is placed in the output register is selected according to signals applied to selected address input leads A0 through A3 of the programmable read only memory. The number of address input signals utilized to determine which initialize word is placed in the output register of the programmable read only memory is a selected subset of the available address input signals provided in the memory. The described embodiment provides sixteen initialize words using a minimum number of components. The sixteen data words are stored in an additional row 12 of the programmable array which contains the memory s normally addressable data words. Because the initialize word circuit 12 is configured as an extra row of the programmable array, the initialize word occupies less chip area than a conventional initialize word circuit. In addition, fewer components are necessary to implement an initialize word construction according to this invention because the inherent selection circuitry of the programmable array is used rather than circuitry which deselects the normal data word provided by the programmable array.
