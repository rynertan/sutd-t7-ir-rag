# Combinatorial weighing system.

## Abstract
A combinatorial weighing system includes a combinato rial weighing apparatus 10 , a packing machine 7 and master slave changeover means 6 . The combinatorial weighing apparatus has a plurality of weighing machines 1 n for sensing the weight of articles supplied thereto, and a calculation control unit 4 for performing a combinatorial calculation based on weight data from the weighing machines to obtain an optimum combination, and for causing weighing machines corresponding to the optimum combination to discharge their articles, which are then packed by the packing machine. The master slave changeov er means switches between a mode in which the packing machine is the master of the weighing and packing operation and a mode in which the weighing apparatus is the master of the weighing and packing operation. The arrangement results in a combinatorial weighing apparatus which ha greatly simplified hardware and which can operate in association with either a master or slave type packing machine.
