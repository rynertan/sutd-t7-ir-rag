# Loop type data highway system.

## Abstract
A loop type data highway system in which a plurality of data transmission control stations abbreviated herein as stations ST are connected in cascade to a loop transmis sion line 100 . Each of the stations ST responds to a polling frame POL inquiring of request for reservation of the transmission line. The polling frame is composed of a first field P for inquiring of the line reservation request and a second field S indicative of whether the line 100 is reserved or not. Each station receives signals inputted from the upstream side along the line 100 and sequentially repeats them to the downstream side along the line 100 without delay. In the station having the line reservation request, a pattern representative of the line reservation is written in the second field S after reception of the first field and sends out the polling frame to the downstream. When the second field as received indicates the non reserved state of the transmission line, transmission of data is initiated in succession to the second field.
