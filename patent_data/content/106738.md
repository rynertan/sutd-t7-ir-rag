# AGC METHOD AND APPARATUS

## Abstract
An improved AGC circuit utilizes a two stage amplifier attenuator wherein each stage of the circuit comprises at least one JFET having its gate biased by a buffered feedback voltage derived from both the signal and control voltages. The dynamic range of each stage can be increased by paralleling additional JFETs in each stage. The buffers in the feedback loop are broadband to allow control down to DC, provide isolation between each stage and the signal output and help to minimize the amount of signal offset introduced into the signal by the control voltage.
