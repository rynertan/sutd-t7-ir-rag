# Thermosetting coating composition containing a blocked acid as catalyst.

## Abstract
A thermosetting coating composition containing an acid curable amino resin and from 0,1 to 10 per cent by weight of a blocked sulphonic acid, calculated on the weight of amino resin. The blocked acid used is an O sulphonyl hydroxamic ester of the formula RSOâ‚‚ONHCOO The compositions may be used advantageously for coating a substrate by electrostatic spraying.
