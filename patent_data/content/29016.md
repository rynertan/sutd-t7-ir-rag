## Description
Improved diaphragm press for grapes and grape husks he pressing of grape husks or of grapes serves to separate the wine or must from the solid parts. With known diaphragm presses, shown diagrammatically in cross section form in Fig. 1, this is achieved through the use of compressed air that presses, with the aid of a flexible diaphragm 1 , the grape husks 2 against a wall 3 from the holes in which the liquid obtained passes into the cavity between this and an inner wall of the container 4 , and is then sent outside.The container 4 is provided with an aperture 5 complete with a corresponding cover 6 , for charging the grape husks. The container 4 can be placed in rotation around the longitudinal axis 7 Fig. 2 . After a certain pressing time has elapsed, it Can be seen that solid substances carried forward block the streams in which the must flows.By removing the pressure, sucking the diaphragm towards the container and causing the whole unit to rotate around the longitudinal axis crushing stage , the said streams are set in motion again.It is obvious that the use of grape husks rich in must requires a greater pressing time moreover, the pumping and distribution of the grape husks requires them to have a considerable must content. A notable amount of time is taken in clearing this must, with a consequential loss in productivity, and to this contributes also the time needed to charge the grape husks into the inside of the container. ice the yessel in question is pressurized, the container 4 has to conply with certain standards of strength and talus the aperture 5 is normally of limited dimensions, also because it is ea3y, in this way, to seal it by meals of the cover 6 which slides axially with respect to the container i ig. 2 .The object of the invention is to provide a diaphragm press that has one or more apertures for the charging of the grape husks, placed longitudinally almost along the full generatrix of the container in such a way as to offer overall more ample entry to the inside of the press. The said greater entry possibility permits a more immediate and uniform distributian of the grape husks in the inside of the press and allows the use therewith of a charging hopper, placed in the region of the said apertures and so shaped as to let the grape husks drain satisfactorily under natural pressure prior to their being inserted.A further object of the invention is to provide the inside of the container with two separate chambers for the charging of the grape husks, each provided with a flexible diaphragm on one side, and with a drilled wall on the other, so as to break down the mass of grape husks to be pressed under the action of the diaphragm.These and other objects too are attained with the improved diaphragm press forming the subject of the invention which, from a general point of view, is characterized by the fact that the said press is provided longitudinally with one or more apertures, fitted with corresponding doors, that extend over almost the full length of a generatrix of the said container and communicate internally therein with a chamber provision being made for a charging hopper placed above the said apertures, the lateral and back walls of which are connected internally to drilled sheet metal ele ments and form a hollow communicating with a draining chan nel for the discharge of the naturally pressed must, that can be removed in order to open the said back walls down wards tile inside of the said hopper being provided with panels placed vertically, connected to the said back walls in such a way as to accompany them, at the time they are being opened, without obstructing the grape husk discharge port.Advantageously and in accordance with a further characteristic of the press in question, the said container has internally two flexible diaphragms placed almost centrally, each of which faces, on opposite sides, a drilled sheet metal plate that is placed in close contact with the inner walls of the container and forms therewith a cavity for the discharge of the must, each diaphragm and each corresponding sheet metal plate defining a chamber for the charging of the grape husks between the said diaphragms there being a baffle, placed along the diameter thereof, fastened to the said container and corresponding centrally to the said apertures, constituted by two drilled walls that internally create a hollow that communicates with the means for supplying the compressed air.A further characteristic, according to another preferred form of embodiment for the press in question, is that two diaphragms are placed, on opposite sides, almost in close contact with the inner surfaces of the said container, and that a pair of opposite, drilled, sheet metal plates placed along the diameter of the said container, corresponding centrally to the said apertures, form between them a hollow for the discharge of the must means being provided to send compressed air in between the said diaphragms and the walls of the container opposite thereto.Obvious advantages are obtained and in addition to a more uniform and faster insertion of the grape husks into the container via an aperture that extends over almost the full length thereof, effected by means of a hopper with which prior partial draining is possible, the fact that the grape husks are shared in two chambers in the press, each of which is provided with a flexible diaphragm and a drilled wall opposite thereto for the evacuation of the must, enables better pressing of the grape husks to be achieved, the path followed by the must in order to reach the discharge channels to be shorter, a consequential higher processing speed and thus the productivity of the press to be greater.Further characteristics and advantages will become more obvious from the detailed description of one preferred, though not sole, form of embodiment for the diaphragm press in question, given below with reference to the accompanying draw ings, in which Fig, 1 shows diagrammatically, in cross section form, a press of a known type Fig, 2 shows diagraimnatically, in a plan view, a press of a known type Fig. 3 shows, in a view sesti from above, the improved press in question with the grape husk charging apertures in the open stage Fig. 4 shows, in particular, one section of the apert ures and of the corresponding covers Fig. 5 shows, in cross seotion form, one possible, dia grammatic variant for the conatruction of a container constituted by two shells that can be set apart Big. 6 shows, in cross section form, the charging hop per utilizable with the said apertures Pig. 7 shows a first preferred form of embodiment for the press as per Fig. 3, provided internally with two chambers for the pressing of the grape husks Fig. 8 shows a second preferred form of embodiment for the press as per Fig. 3, with a different constitution of the two chambers for the pressing of the grape husks. In Fig. 5 are depicted a number of apertures 5 made longitudinally all along the generatrix of the container 4 , the conditions of resistance of this being compensated by means of minimum gauge transverse braces 8 , the said apertures being provided with an identical number of covers that constitute the doors 9 which move forward tangentially encouraged also by the rotation of the container around the longitudilal axis 7 .Between the door 9 and the container 4 an elastic element 10 Fig. 4 , which ser ves as a gasket, is kept under pressure, In order to arrive as close as possible at the conditions of total longitudinal opening, the transverse braces 8 must necessarily be of minimum gauge which, however, gives rise to considerable problems that have been overcome with the solution illustrated in Fig. 4 wherein the elastic element 10 , that acts as a seal, is fastened tightly to the door 9 by means of screws and frames 11 , while the cover is connected to the container 4 through a T iron that forms the guides 12 so that the door 9 can slide tangentially , that also serves as a reinforcement for the said transverse braces 8 .Another solution for achieving the total longitudinal open ing is that shown diagrammatically in Fig. 5, consisting in dividing the container into two, almost identical, shells 13 and 14 connected one to the other at the corresponding lower extremities 15 , which are provided, all along the contact extremities thereof, with a sealing gasket 16 .Because of the length of the aperture and thus because it is easy to charge the drained must and to immediately accommodate it inside the container, it is possible to use with the press a charging hopper 17 , shown in Fig. 6, whose task is to drain the grape husks. In this, all the walls 18 , including the back walls 19 , constitute with an internal drilled sheet metal plate 20 , a hollow cavity.A draining channel 21 for discharging the must obtained from the natural pressure draining of the grape husks, is made in a way iu which it can be removed in order to allow the back walls 19 to be rotated downwards and the hopper to be opened. Two panels, made of drilled sheet metal, are placed longitudinally in the hopper, secured to the said back walls 19 so as to accompany them during the opening stage without obstructing the discharge port of the grape tusks, their purpose being to improve the draining, and these are romovable in the event of non crushed grapes being used.Another improvement results from the shortening of the path towards the outside followed by the must when leaving the mass of grape husks. Since the pressing speed is somewhat limited, time is, in fact, saved by reducing the path followed by the must. The solution is depicted diagrammatically in Fig. 7 wherein the container 4 , again rotatable as in all diaphragm presses for grapes, carries inside a drilled sheet metal plate 23 close up against the walls thereof.Two flexible diaphragms 24 , depicted in the vacuum stage, are placed in a central position at the time of charging via the aperture 5 that can be closed by the door 9 , or during the crushing stage,and when compressed air is sent between them, through a baffle 25 constituted by two drilled walls positioned along the diameter of the container, in the region of the said aperture 5 , between the said diaphragms, they expand and go and compress the grap husks present in the chamber 26 up against the drilled sheet metal plate 23 .Another possible form of embodiment is depicted diagrammatically in Fig. 8 wherein the container 4 is provided internally with two diaphragms 27 and a pair of opposite, drilled, sheet metal plates 28 that form between them a cavity for the flow of must, these being placed along the diameter of the container, in the region of the said aperture 5 . The air under pressure is sent between the in ner walls of the container 4 and the diaphragms 27 opposite thereto, in order to compress against the drilled sheet Metal plates 28 , the grape husks charged in the two chambers 29 . The charge , naturally takes place through the longitudinal aperture 5 that can be closed by the door 9 again provided with elastic sealing elements 10 . The crushing of the grape husks achieved with the said two solutions is improved because of the fact that there is no internal rolling of the grape husks, and thus the quantity of solid substances carried forward is less. The first compression occurs, in fact, with the central baffle in a horizontal position, and thus the distribution of grape husks attached to the baffle is bettered. 21rthersore, the use of a vacuum in addition to the compression causes the air interposed in the vacant spaces in the crushed grape husks, when sucked up, to reopen the must flow channels.A vacuum can be obtained by closing the discharge of the must and placing the chamber in communication with the diaphragm vacuum apparatus This can also be achieved with continuity by discharging the must eoaxially with the axis of rotation and by applying a constant vacuum throughout the grape husk compression stages. To graphically simpli matters, the channels and ducts for sending air under pressure or for eventual operating necessities, that pass coaxially to the axis of rotation or laterally to the container, have been omitted.Naturally what has been described and illustrated herein is purely an unlimited example and multiple variants are possible in the construction of the diaphragm pump in question, all of which fall within the framework of protection defined by the claims.
