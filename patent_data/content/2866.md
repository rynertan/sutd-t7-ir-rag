## Description
Akzo N.V., Amhem Process for coating a substrate with a radiation curable coating composition and a process for the preparation of such a composition.The invention relates to a process for coating a substrate by applying to it a radiation curable coating composition based on an acryloyl groups and or methacryloyl groups containing polyester resin and a vinyl monomer and curing said composition by ionizing radiation.A process of the type indicated above is known from British PatentSpecification 1 286 591, in which use is made of ionizing radiation by an electron beam and there is no need for the presence of a photoinitiator. When, however, use is made of ionizing radiation by ultraviolet light, the man skilled in the art will usually include a photoinitiator in the coating composition. A disadvantage to the afore mentioned binder is that the resin is as a rule insufficiently soluble in the normally employed monomeric compound s . Moreover, the cured layer of the binder will generally show surface irregularities such as craters and it is often insufficiently flexible.The present invention has for its object to provide an improved binder, as a result of which the above described drawbacks are obviated and the film obtained has an attractive appearance and considerable body. The process according to the invention is characterized in that the polyester resin is built up from 5 65 by weight of an aliphatic monocarboxylic acid having 5 18 carbon atoms and contains an ethylenic unsaturation, provided by acryloyl and or methacryloyl groups, of 0,2 to 7 equivalents of double bonds per kilograumie. The invention also relates to a process for the preparation of the above envisaged radiation curable coating composition. The polyester resin to be used according to the present invention is referred to hereinafter as alkyd resin.For completeness sake mention should still be made of the GermanPatent Application 2 544 594 describing ethylenically unsaturated polyester compositions containing an oxygen blocking agent, the ethylenic unsaturation being provided by an a,8 ethylenically unsaturated dicarboxylic acid, such as maleic acid or fumaric acid.To obtain a uniform, mat, cured coating without showing any structure in spite of the presence of an oxygen blocking agent such as paraffin or wax the polyester must also contain 0,15 to 0,7 moles of an aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic monocarboxylic acid per mole of the a,6 ethylenically unsaturated dicarboxylic acid.The preparation of the alkyd resin may be carried out in the presence of generally one or more aliphatic and or cycloaliphatic mono , di , and or polyvalent alcohols, one or more aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and or aromatic di or polyvalent carboxylic acids, acrylic acid and or methacrylic acid or derivatives thereof and one or more other suitable monovalent carboxylic acids and or esters thereof.As examples of suitable alcohols may be mentioned lauryl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, cyclohexanol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, neopentyl glycol, 1,6 hexane diol, 2, 2 bis 4 hydroxycyclohexyl propane, 2,2 bis p phenyleneoxyethanol propane, 2,2 bis p phenyleneoxy 2 propanol propane, diethylene glycol, glycerol, trimethylol ethane, trimethylol propane, pentaerythritol and or dipentaerythritol and or the corresponding epoxy compounds.As examples of suitable di or polyvalent carboxylic acids may be mentioned maleic acid, fumaric acid, itaconic acid, citraconic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid, tetrahydrophthalic acid, hexahydrophtha lic acid, endomethylene tetrahydrophthalic acid, o phthalic acid, dichlorophthalic acid, hexachioroendomethylene tetrahydrophtha lic acid, isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, trimellitic acid and or pyromellitic acid.If desired, the carboxylic acid also may be used in the form of an anhydride, for instance maleic anhydride or phthalic anhydride.It is preferred that the dicarboxylic acid is o phthalic acid, isophthalic acid, tetrahydrophthalic acid and or adipic acid.According to the invention the alkyd resin is built up from 5 65 by weight and preferably 10 55 by weight of an aliphatic monocarboxylic acid having 5 18, and preferably 7 18 carbon atoms.As examples of suitable aliphatic monocarboxylic acids may be mentioned valeric acid, heptanoic acid, 2 ethyl hexanoic acid, pelargonic acid, isononanoic acid, lauric acid, coconut oil fatty acid, tall oil fatty acid, stearic acid and branched fatty acids containing 18 carbon atoms.It is preferred that the monocarboxylic acid should be saturated.Moreover, it is preferred that the monocarboxylic acid should be branched. More particularly, use is made of 2 ethyl hexanoic acid or isononanoic acid.Optionally, use may be made of mixtures of 2 or more of the aboveenvisaged aliphatic monocarboxylic acids. In the preparation of the alkyd resin it is possible, if desired, for the aliphatic monocarboxylic acid to be employed as an ester thereof, with the alco hol being for instance a polyvalent alcohol such as glycerol. It is of course also possible to use mixtures of alkyd resins.The weight average molecular weight of the alkyd resin may vary between wide limits, depending on the field of application envisaged, and may be in the range of, for instance, 800 to 100 000.The hydroxyl number of the alkyd resin is generally in the range of 5 to 200, and preferably in the range of 15 to 200 the acid number should be in the range of 0 to 120. The alkyd resin may be prepared in any convenient manner, for instance by means of the solvent process, in which the water evolved in the reaction is removed azeotropically with, for instance, an organic solvent such as toluene or xylene, after which generally the volatile constituents are to the desired extent removed in vacuo.If desired, however, use may be made of the melting process, in which the reaction takes place with evaporation of the reaction water in the absence of an organic solvent. As esterification catalyst may be used any suitable compound, for instance sulphuric acid, p toluene sulphonic acid, benzene sulphonic acid, naphthalene sulphonic acid and metal compounds, for instance dibutyl tin oxide and dibutyl tin dilaurate.Incorporation of the acryloyl groups and or methacryloyl groups into the alkyd resin may be carried out in any convenient manner, for instance by esterification of an alkyd resin with the use of meth acrylic acid or, if desired, the corresponding acid chloride, which alkyd resin contains so many hydroxyl groups that the hydroxyl number of the unmodified alkyd resin is generally in the range of 25 to 410, and preferably 30 to 300. Esterification may take place in a suitable solvent, such as toluene or xylene, in the presence of an esterification catalyst. If desired, however, the alkyd resin forming starting compounds together with methlacrylic acid and or the corresponding acid chloride thereof may be polymerized by condensation, so that the preparation of the alkyd resin may be effected in one step. The alkyd resin according to the invention contains an ethylenic unsaturation, caused by meth acryloyl groups, of 0,2 to 7 and preferably of 0,5 to 4 equivalents of double bonds per kg. In addition, the alkyd resin may still contain one or more other ethylenically unsaturated compounds, for instance maleic acid, fumaric acid and tetrahydrophthalic acid.The radiation curable coating composition further generally contains one or more vinyl compounds, for instance in amounts of 20 to 400, and preferably 80 to 250 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the polyester resin containing acryloyl and or methacryloyl groups.As examples of suitable vinyl compounds may be mentioned styrene, divinyl benzene, diallyl phthalate and acrylic or methacrylic esters of alcohols having 1 to 12 carbon atoms, such as methanol, ethanol, n butanol, isobutanol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, 1,4butane diol, 1,5 pentane diol, neopentyl glycol, 1,6 hexane diol, polyethylene glycol, glycerol, trimethylol ethane, trimethylol propane, pentaerythritol, 2 12 bis 4 hydroxycyclohexyl propane, 2,2 bis p phenyleneoxy ethanol propane and 2,2 bis p phenyleneoxy 2propanol propane.If desired, the radiation curable coating composition may contain one or more photoinitiators, for instance in the case where the coating composition is subjected to ultraviolet radiation. As examples of suitable photoinitiators may be mentioned aromatic carbonyl compounds such as benzophenone, acetophenone, diethoxyacetophenone, chlorothioxanthone, ber.utl, benzildimethyl ketal and benzoin and ethers thereof, such as the methyl ether, the ethyl ether, the propyl ether and the tert. butyl ether. It is preferred that use should be made of benzildimethyl ketal. If desired, also photosentizers and or accelerators may be present. As suitable examples thereof may be mentioned Michler s ketone and amines such as triethanolamine.The coating composition may contain still other additives, if desired. As examples thereof may be mentioned polymers such as polyester resins, epoxy resins or polyacrylates, pigment dispersing agents, levelling agents, fillers, pigments, polymerization inhibitors such as hydroquinone, phenothiazine and or copper, dyes and solvents.Applying the coating composition to the desired substrate may be carried out in any convenient manner, for instance by brushing or rolling, spraying, sprinkling, flow coating, dipping or by electrostatic spraying. The coating composition may with advantage be applied to a substrate of a synthetic material such as a polyalkylene, for instance polyethylene and polypropylene polyethylene terephthalate and polybutylene terephthalate, and to substrates of metal such as tinplate and sheet steel. It is preferred that the composition should be applied to wood and wood like materials such as core board, chip board, hardboard, veneer and paper.Curing the composition according to the invention may be effected by subjecting it to ionizing radiation with ultraviolet light or a beam of accelerated electrons. As U.V. radiation source may for instance serve a mercury vapour or xenon lamp which operates at high, medium or low pressure. The beam of accelerated electrons is as a rule generated by using a potential difference in the range of 150 to 600 kV and a current in the range of 1 to 100 mA. The dose of radiation required for curing is normally within the range of 0,01 to 20 Mrad, and preferably 1 to 5 Mrad. The composition need be irradiated only for a fraction of a second to a few minutes in order to be suffuciently cured.The invention will be illustrated kut not limited by the following examples. In them the viscosity of the paint will be expressed in seconds of efflux time and determined with a Din Cup 4 at a temperature of 20CC. The viscosity mentioned in the Tables 1 and 2 is that of a 70 by weight solution of the final binder in hexane diol l, 6 diacrylate and neopentyl glycol diacrylate, respectively.In the determination of the viscosity use is made of an Epprecht rotational viscometer and a temperature of 200C and the viscosity is expressed in m Pa. s. The weight average molecular weight is determined with gel permeation chromatography. The parts are by weight, unless otherwise indicated. Bexane 1,6 diol is referred to as HDDA and neopentyl glycol diacrylate as NPGDA.Preparation of resins A J The resins mentioned in Table 1 were obtained in a two step process.In a reactor provided with a stirrer, a distillation column with water separator, a thermometer and a gas inlet tube the starting materials mentioned under Composition first step in Table 1 were admixed. The amounts mentioned in Table 1 are given in grammes.Subsequently, polycondensation was carried out in the usual manner with azeotropic water removal until a given acid number was reached.After the mixture had been cooled down, meth acrylic acid, the esterification catalyst, the solvent and a polymerization inhibitor were added as mentioned under Composition second step in Table 1.Next, the esterification reaction was carried out at a temperature between 115 and 130 C until the given acid number was reached.At conclusion of the reaction the solvent was removed by distillation in vacuo and the product obtained was mixed with the desired vinyl monomer.

The paint was cured by means of accelerated electrons using a dose of 2 Mrad. At the radiation apparatus employed this meant the use of an acceleration voltage of 300 kV and a current of 40 mA at a feed rate of 25 metres per minute. During curing the paint film was in an inert atmosphere having an oxygen content of less than 50 ppm. After having been rubbed 100 times with a wad soaked in methyl ethyl ketone so called MEK rubs the hardness of the coatings obtained had decreased only very little. The coating composition based on the reference resinA displayed a bad flow and an irregular and poor appearance. The flow of the coating composition based on the alkyd resin B was somewhat better, and the alkyd resin C showed distinctly better levelling and moreover had a more regular and less poor appearance than the reference polyester A.Example 2The alkyd resin D was diluted to a viscosity of 40 se conds with 83 parts of HDDA per 100 parts of solid alkyd resin. For the reference polyester A 160 parts of HDDA per 100 parts of solid resin had to be used to obtain the same viscosity. Moreover, unlike the alkyd resin D, it was difficult to dissolve, whereas, as 70 by weight solution in HDDA, the reference resin A showed a far higher viscosity than resin D.The resulting clear paint based on alkyd resin D and obtained in the above indicated way was applied to veneered chipboard to a layer thickness of about 40Wm by means of a roller, after which the paint was cured with accelerated electrons using a dose of 4 Mrad. The paint film obtained displayed very good levelling and body and the surface was entirely free from craters or other irregularities.Example 3The alkyd resin E was diluted to a viscosity of 40 seconds with only 45 parts of HDDA per 100 parts of solid resin. The paint thus obtained was applied to a veneered chipboard to a layer thickness of about 80m by means of a curtain coating machine. The paint was cured with accelerated electrons using a dose of 5 Mrad. The paint film obtained displayed excellent body and gloss and was perfectly free from craters.Example 4From the alkyd resin F a white flow coat paint was pared pared in the same way as indicated in example 1, except that the resin was diluted with 104 parts of HDDA per 100 parts of solid resin to obtain un application viscosity of 40.seconds. The paint was applied to filled chipboard to a layer thickness of about 60pmThe paint film was cured with accelerated electrons.Using a dose of 1 FIrad a very good hardness and resistance to methyl ethyl ketone was obtained. The resulting film displayed excellent levelling and had no surface defects. For comparison use was made of a resin G which, unlike the alkyd resin F, was modified with an aromatic monocarboxylic acid. The reference resin showed an extremely high viscosity upon dilution with HDDA see Table 1 . The resin G was processed into a paint in the same manner as the alkyd resin F, 161 parts of HDDA being needed per 100 parts of solid resin to obtain an application viscosity of 40 seconds. The paint was applied and cured as indicated in the first half of this example, but in contrast to the paint according to the invention it displayed very poor levelling and an irregular surface with craters.EXample 5From the alkyd resin F a clear paint was prepared by dissolving 100 parts of solid resin in 189 parts of diethylene glycol diacrylate, so that a viscosity of 25 seconds was obtained. To 100 parts of this paint there were added 7 parts of benzophenone and 6 parts of triethanolamine. The paint was applied to tin plate to a layer thickness of about 30 cm with the aid of a bar wound with wire. The paint was cured with the use of a Philips HOK 5 W lamp having a slit width of 7 cm and a curing speed of 4 metres per minute. The film displayed particularly 4ood levelling and body and had no surface defects. The film showed a very good combination of hardness and flexibility.Example 6The alkyd resin H was diluted to a viscosity of 40 seconds with 74 parts of HDDA. The clear paint was applied to veneered fibre board to a layer thickness of 65 pm with the aid of a curtain coating machine. The paint was cured with accelerated electrons at a dose of 4 Mrad. The cured film had a very attractive surface and a good resistance to solvents over 100 MEK rubs see Example 1 . Example 7 A white paint based on alkyd resin I and HDDA and pig mented with 50 parts of titanium dioxide per 100 parts of solid alkyd resin, and having a viscosity of 70 se conds, was applied to stopped hard board panels to a layer thickness of 30Um by means of a roller. The paint film was cured with accelerated electrons, the use of a dose of 3 Mrad leading to good hardness and resistan ce to solvents. The paint displayed a good body and a favourable appearance. Example 8 From the alkyd resin J a white flow coat paint was pre pared as indicated in Example 1. The paint was diluted to a viscosity of 40 seconds with NPGDA and showed no tendency to precipitation of the pigment. The paint was applied to stopped chipboard to a layer thickness of about 80 Um by means of a curtain coating machine. After the paint had been cured by means of accelerated electrons at a dose of 1 Mrad, a very good looking and solvent resistant film was obtained having a good hard ness. The film displayed a good body and was entirely free from craters and other surface irregularities. Example 9 The alkyd resin K was diluted to a viscosity of 70 seconds with HDDA and subsequently applied to printed paper to a layer thickness of lOpm with the aid of a roller. Next, the paint film was cured with aid of ac celerated electrons. Using a dose of 1 Mrad led to a completely cured coating resistant to solvents. Example 10The alkyd resin L was diluted to a viscosity of 40 seconds with HDDA. The clear paint thus obtained was subsequently applied toveneered chipboard to a layer thickness of 80 m by means of a curtain coating machi .ne, after which the paint was cured with accelerated electrons at a dose of 4 Mrad. The cured film had a very attractive high gloss, and very good levelling and did riot show any surface defects. Nor did the paint show any tendency to sink into the underground.
