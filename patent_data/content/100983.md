# Steroid compounds with choleretic activity, a process for their preparation, and therapeutic compounds which contain them as active principle.

## Abstract
New salts of steroid acids with trimebutine are prepared, of formula In the acid, A can be CO, CH OH or CH₂, and n is between 1 and 4. Furthermore, the OH group in position 3 is in α and that in position 7 can be in α or in β if A is CHOH, the OH group in position 12 is in α. The new compounds have a choleretic action compara ble with that of ursodeoxycholic acid in terms of intensity, but is considerably more prolonged in time, and is associ ated with an antispastic action which is approximately double that of trimebutine.
