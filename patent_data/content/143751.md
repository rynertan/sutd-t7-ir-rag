## Description
This invention relates to a connector element for interconnecting plate like members which enables the latter to be mutually rotated through 360 degrees. As is known, the need is felt in many fields for connector elements which can interconnect plate like members, such as panels, glass panes, and the like such that any panel or glass pane may be rotated through 3600 relatively to another. Currently used connectors have the disadvantage of having a complex construction which makes assembling of the various panels a complicated and labour consuming operation. With particular reference to the field of shower bath booths, it is in many instances necessary to provide connector elements which can connect glass panes together such as to ensure adequate leak proof features and the faculty of easily folding one pane against the other to reduce the space requirements of the shower bath booth when the latter is not being used. Another disadvantage of prior approaches resides in that the connector elements actually made available are bulky and little versatile. For such reasons, their application to glass panes may be quite a difficult task. It is a primary object of this invention to obviate such prior deficiencies by providing a connector element for interconnecting plate like members of various description, which can ensure a 3600 rotation ability therefor without involving a bulky arrangement along thusly interconnected edges of said plate like members. A further object of the invention is to provide a connector element for interconnecting plate like members, which affords good leak proof features, thereby an element can be provided which is specially suitable for supporting glass panes intended to form movable parts of a shower bath booth or bath tub screen or for application in the building construction field. It is another object of this invention to provide a connector element which comprises a small number of component parts, and can give full assurance of being reliable and safe to use. Still another object of the invention is to provide a connector element of relatively low cost, so that it can achieve widespread application among users. These and other objects, such as will be apparent hereinafter, are achieved by a connector element for interconnecting plate like members, and adapted to ensure 3600 mutual rotation capabilities there for, according to the invention, characterized in that it comprises a first body associable with one edge of one of the plate like members to be interconnected and a second body associable with one edge of another of the plate like members to be interconnected. Also provided is a connective portion hingedly attached with its ends to said bodies for mutual rotation about axes extending substantially parallel to the adjoining edges of said plate like members. Further features and advantages of the invention will be more clearly understood by making reference to the following detailed description of a connector element for interconnecting plate like members for 3600 rotation capabilities, in conjunction with the accompanying illustrative drawing, where Figure 1 shows schematically and in perspective the connector element of this invention Figure 2 is a front view of a wall portion comprising two plate like members connected together by a connector element Figure 3 is a bottom view of the swine detail shown in Figure 2 Figure 4 is a top view of a connector element between two plate like members, with the latter in a part folded condition one against the other Figure 5 is a front view of two panel doors interconnected by means of this connector element Figures 6 and 7 are perspective views of two walls formed by accordion like folding panels, which incorporate this connector element and are shown in a partly extended condition and folded one of minimum bulk. With reference to the nurnerals used in the cited drawing figures, this connector element for interconnecting plate like members such that the latter can be mutually rotated through 3600, as generally designated with the reference numeral 1, comprises essentially a first body 2 and second body 3. The bodies 2 and 3 have a substantially elongate shape with rounded interconnection ends, as explained hereinafter. The bodies 2 and 3 define, at their free ends, a recess or cavity 4 wherein are accommodated the plate like members or panels to be interconnected, or alternatively, sectional members 5 which act as supports for the plates or panels 30. Where sectional members 5 are used, a lip seal 6 may be provided to interconnect the sectional members 5, thereby providing a barrier which ensures a tight seal. The bodies 2 and 3 are hingedly attached, at the mating ends thereof, to a connective portion 10 the ends of which are accommodated in cutouts 11 advantageously defined at the rounded ends of the bodies 2 and 3. Also provided are screw or the like elements, indicated at 12, which function in practice as mutual rotation axles for the bodies 2 and 3 with respect to the connective portion 10. The rotation axis thus defined is substantially parallel to the edge of the sectional member 5 or panel edge, which is connected to the elements. The connective portion 10 has a distance, between the points of mutual hinged connection to the bodies 2 and 3, which larger than or equal to the width of the bodies 2 and 3, thus affording the faculty of rotating one body relative to the other. Viith the connector element of this invention, for assembling shower bath booths or the like screens, one is enabled, moreover, to install on the horizontal crosspieces 20, located at the top and bottom ends of the plate, a sealing gasket 21, which would provide a virtually leak proof closure of the shower booth toward the outside. It may be appreciated from the foregoing description that the invention achieves its objects. In particular, it is pointed out that the provision of a connector element which comprises in practice but three parts articulated to one another, affords a considerable simplification of all the panel and or plate like members or the like assembling procedures, which members are interconnected for mutual rotation through 3600. Furthermore, the connection between the connector element and plate, accomplished by means of an interlocking joint and possible locking at the cavity 4, allows great simplification of the inventive connector element assembling procedure. In practicing the invention, the materials used, and the dimensions and contingent shapes, may be any selected ones to meet individual requirements.
