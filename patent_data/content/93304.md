# Semiconductor IC and method of making the same.

## Abstract
In a semiconductor IC, a vertical pnp or npn transistor of a uniform characteristic and a high breakdown voltage is made by forming, for example, a p collector region 39 in an n type epitaxial region, an n well base region 41 formed in the p collector region 39 and a p emitter region 42 formed in the n well base region 41 and furthermore, for example, p regions 40 and 49 are formed simultaneously with the p collector region 39 and an n region 53 is formed simultaneously with the n well base region 41 , thereby constituting IIL of superior charac teristics and a high resistance device at the same time as forming of the vertical transistor without substantial increase of manufacturing steps and in the similar way, by combin ing the p region and n region formed in the above mentioned simultaneous steps with other region formed simultaneously with the forming of the vertical transistor, high h
