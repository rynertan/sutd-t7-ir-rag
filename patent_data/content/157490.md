# Aperture compensation signal processor for optical recording.

## Abstract
A signal processor 31 and method for frequency com pensating the drive signal 33 for an optical modulator 11 in an optical recording apparatus to make the exposure level modulation amplitude on the medium 1 independent of the spatial frequency of the information being recorded. The processor compensates for exposure level modulation roll off at high spatial frequencies due to the finite size of the recording spot 15 by increasing the amplitude of the modu lator drive signal at high frequencies. The compensation is preferably the inverse of the MTF of the recording objective lens 17 .
