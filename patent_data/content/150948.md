# IMPROVEMENTS IN THE APPLICATION OF DEPILATORY MATERIALS

## Abstract
An applicator for applying a flowable depilatory chemical composition to the skin comprises a reservoir 10 charged with the composition, an applicator head 12 fastened to the reservoir having a flow passage for the composition leading from the reservoir to a mouth, and a generally cylindrical appli cator roller 15 having an indented surface and journalled for rotation in the mouth. The reservoir 10 is removably con nected to the applicator head 12 by a threaded neck 11 whose distal extremity is provided with a deformable circum ferential flange 20 and the applicator head 12 has a bore 21 having a threaded portion that engages the neck 11 and that leads to a convergent portion 22 onto which the flange 20 seats as the applicator head 12 is screwed into position. The reservoir is charged with a flowable depilatory composi tion comprising up to 10 w w of a sulphur containing depila tory material, 0.5 30 w w of an emulsifying wax to give an oils in water cream, 0.1 5 w w of an inert cellulosic thicken er that disperses in the aqueous phase and sufficient alkali to give a pH of 9.0 12.5 and also glucoheptanoic acid or a salt thereof and N hydroxyethyl ethylene diamine triacetic acid or a salt thereof.
