# Chlorosulfonated ethylene vinyl acetate polymer coating composition.

## Abstract
A coating composition containing 10 80 by weight of binder and 20 90 by weight of an organic solvent in which the binder is 1 a chlorosulfonated ethylene vinyl acetate polymer, 2 an epoxy resin, 3 a polyamine curing agent, and optionally 4 a bicyclic amidine. The composition is used as a primer or topcoating for metal substrates and cures at ambienl temperatures. The composition provides a finish that has excellent adhesion to the substrate and is tough, durable, weatherable and, when pigmented with electrically conductive pigments, can be used as a coating for electrodes used in electrochemical reactions, such as grids used in lead acid storage batteries.
