Known processes for producing the vicinal dihalogenated products from alkenes and alkynes typically involve the addition of alkene or alkyne and free heterogeneous halogen in a reactor under controlled conditions.The use of free heterogeneous halogen in these processes requires expensive control procedures and equipment to prevent loss of this toxic and corrosive reactant. Also, the use of free heterogeneous halogen is now preferably avoided because of the energy intensive process employed for its production. An improved process is provided by the present invention for producing vicinal, heterogeneous dihalogenated products from alkenes and alkynes. The enzymatic halogenating process of the present invention has several advantages over the present state of the art for producing vicinal, heterogeneous dihalogenated products from alkenes and alkynes, including the following The use of inexpensive, less dangerous, inorganic halides, rather than elemental halogen or expensive reagents, i.e., chloride ion plus bromide ion rather than bromine chloride, fluoride ion plus iodide ion rather than iodine fluoride or antimony trifluoride and iodine the use of ambient temperature and the use of standard or close to standard atmospheric pressure. In addition to proceeding favorably at room temperature, this enzymatic process involves the use of dilute H202, not necessarily purified. The H202 may be added directly or generated in situ by an enzymatic or chemical reaction. This reduces the cost of the H202 as compared to the cost of concentrated, purified material increases the safe usage of the substance and extends the life of the halogenating enzyme. Very generally, the low cost method of e Lnvewaon produces vicinal, heterogeneous dihalogenated products from alkenes and alkynes by providing in a reaction vessel a mixture of halogenating enzyme, an oxidizing agent and two different halide ions. An alkene or alkyne is introduced into the vessel and maintained in contact with the reaction mixture for a sufficient period of time to convert the alkene or alkyne to the desired vicinal, heterogeneous dihalogenated product. The present invention is based on the discovery that the group of enzymes classified as haloperoxidases acts upon alkenes and alkynes to produce vicinal, heterogeneous dihalogenated products. These products are characterized by the structural formula EMI4.1 where X and X1 are selected from a group consisting of either fluoride, chloride, bromide or iodide, but where x f X1.

Morrison et al Ann. Rev. Biochem. 45, 861 1976 state that chloroperoxidase is the only one of the haloperoxidases studied that is known to be influenced by the presence of halide ion mixtures.Both chloride and bromide in concentrations up to 0.1 M greatly enhance iodination of thyroglobulin. Although this stimulation was observed, only homogeneous monohalogenated product was observed.Hager et al J. Biol. Chem. 241, 1769 1966 state that fluoride ion when present with chloride ion inhibits the chlorination of monochlorodimedon by chloroperoxidase.Bakkenist et al Biochim. Biophys. Acta 613, 337 1980 reported the same effect of fluoride ion on the bromination of monochlorodimedon by myeloperoxidase. But in none of these reports was there any evidence presented for heterogeneous dihalogen addition. Therefore, it was not obvious that haloperoxidase would produce vicinal, heterogeneous dihalogenated products from alkenes and alkynes when the enzymatic reactions were run in the presence of two different halide ions. In accordance with this invention, a process has been developed for the production of vicinal, heterogeneous dihalogenated products. Prior art teaches that haloperoxidases can incorporate only certain halides Morrison et al, Ann. Rev.

Such enzymes include chloroperoxidase derived from the microorganism Caldariomyces fumago, bromoperoxidase derived from algae, lactoperoxidase derived from milk, thyroid peroxidase derived from thyroid, myeloperoxidase derived from leukocytes, and horseradish peroxidase derived from horseradish. Certain of these haloperoxidases are commercially available. The preferred haloperoxidase depends upon the products desired.

The microorganism,Caldariomyces fumago, may be grown as a static or agitated, submerged culture in Czapek Dox medium at room temperature for 3 to 10 days by conventional methods. The halogenating enzyme, chloroperoxidase, is prepared from an aqueous homogenate of the mycelial pads of the microorganism grown under static conditions or from the filtrate of the microorganism grown under static or agitated submerged culture conditions. Detailed descriptions for preparing chloroperoxidase can be found in the following articles and patent 1 U.S. Patent No. 4,247,641,Neidleman et al, 1981 2 Morris et al, J. Biol. Chem.241, 1763, 1966 and 3 Cooney et al, Biotech. Bioeng. 16, 1045, 1974 . The halogenating enzyme may also be used in an immobilized form. Processes for enzyme immobilization are familiar to those skilled in the art, and include reacting either a solution of the enzyme or a suspension of enzyme containing cells with one of a broad range of organic or inorganic supports. Included among these are polyacrylamide, ethylene maleic acid copolymers, methacrylic based polymers, polypeptides, styrene based polymers, agarose, cellulose, dextran, porous glass beads, and aluminum or titanium hydroxide. Enzymes in this form have increased stability, extended life and usefulness, and recoverability. Reactions employing immobilized enzymes may be run in columns or reaction tanks. In addition to the halogenating enzymes, an oxidizing agent is required in the reaction mixture. A preferred oxidizing agent is hydrogen peroxide, which may be added directly to the mixture in a single batch addition, or in a continuous slow feed. It may alternatively be generated as a slow feed in situ by the use of a hydrogen peroxide producing enzyme system. Such enzyme systems are well known in the art, and include glucose l oxidase in the presence of D glucose, pyranose2 oxidase or glucose 2 oxidase in the presence of Dglucose, D and L amino acid oxidases in the presence ofD and L methionine, methanol oxidase in the presence of methanol, and diamine oxidases in the presence of histamine. The hydrogen peroxide generating system may be present in the non immobilized or immobilized state as with the halogenating enzyme.The hydrogen peroxide may also be generated by chemical reaction, such as by anthraquinone or isopropyl alcohol oxidation processes. The hydrogen peroxide is present preferably in molar ratio of from about 0.5 1 to about 50 1, most preferably in a ratio of about 1 1 or less with respect to the alkene or alkyne. The molar ratio preferences refer to the average presence of hydrogen peroxide during the reaction. The actual molar ratio will usually vary during the reaction and the molar ratio at any particular time may be above or below the ranges cited. Other suitable oxidizing agents include organic peroxides, such as methyl, ethyl, or butyl peroxides. Also, a source of two different water soluble halide salts is required in the reaction mixture. The preferred halide salts are the fluoride, chloride, bromide and iodide salts of the alkali metals, sodium, potassium and lithium. Seawater or other natural brines which contain molar amounts of halide salts can be used. The total halide ion is present at a concentration greater than 2000 mM. The proportion of each halide ion X and X1 in the reaction mixture is as follows Cxl tX X is present at a concentration of about the stoichiometric amount required for incorporation into product mM amounts . X1 is present in major excess M amounts .The halide ion that is not directly incorporated by haloperoxidase or that has the higher oxidation potential of the two halide ions, is assigned to be X1 . The halide ion that is directly incorporated by haloperoxidase or that has the lower oxidation potential of the two halide ions, is assigned to be X . The reaction is usually conducted with the pH range of from about 2.2 to about 8.0. The pH of the reaction may be maintained within the desired range by use of a buffering agent. Suitable buffers include sodium or potassium phosphate, gluconate, citrate, formate, and acetate based systems. Other suitable techniques besides buffering may be used for pH control and adjustment. The reaction may De conducted in an aqueous diUrp.. While some of the alkenes and alkynes that can be converted by the process are substantially insoluble in an aqueous medium, the reaction, nevertheless, proceeds satisfactorily under conditions of mixing, or other modes of dispersion, which provide sufficient substrate solubility for the reaction. The reaction can also be conducted in the presence of aqueous organic solvent mixtures, such as water solutions containing lower aliphatic alcohols, dioxane, dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide or glycerol, in order to increase substrate solubility. The reaction is preferably conducted under aerobic conditions and in the temperature range of 150 to about 500, preferably at 200 to about 300. As previously indicated, the components of the reaction mixture, namely the alkene or alkyne, the halogenating enzyme, the oxidizing agent, the two different halide ions, and the buffering agent, are simply mixed together in water or mixed aqueous or organic media, and agitated for a period of from about 30 seconds to about 1 hour to obtain the vicinal, heterogeneous dihalogenated products.
