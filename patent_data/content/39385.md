# TRANSMISSION OF VIDEO AND OTHER SIGNALS AND ALSO OF A RETURN MESSAGE BY A SINGLE UNSHIELDED TWO WIRE CABLE

## Abstract
This invention relates to a process and relating device for transmitting through a cable a video signal from a ca mera unit to at least one receiver forward signal and a return message from said receiver to said camera unit, wherein the forward signal is transmitted using an analog modulation and may include also an audio signal. In partic ular the return message is pulsating transmitted by using the same unshielded bipolar cable used for the forward signal. Said return message is sent during the period at which the video signal beam is positioned on the next line, an hence, as well known, said signal is not displayed. A preferred application is concerned with a video interphone and in this case the return message includes the sample audio signal, the door opener signal, the user reply signal and a signal stopping the suply increment.
