# Magnetic materials, permanent magnets and methods of making those.

## Abstract
Magnetic materials comprising Fe, B and R rare earth elements having a major phase of Fe B R intermetallic compound s of tetragonal system, and sintered anisotropic permanent magnets consisting essentially of, by atomic percent, 8 30 R at least one of rare earth elements in clusive of Y , 2 28 B and the balance being Fe with im purities. Those may contain additional elements M Ti, Ni, Bi, V Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Mn, Al, Sb, Ge, Sn, Zr, Hf providing Fe B R M type materials and magnets.
