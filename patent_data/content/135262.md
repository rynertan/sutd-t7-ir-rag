# System for improving embroidered articles.

## Abstract
A system is provided for improving frame adjustments of automatic embroidery machines. Groupings of holes are punched in an elongated tape 46 corresponding to binary numbers. The tape 46 is read by an electro optical reader 20 which converts the information on the tape to electrical pulses which, in turn, control a drive system for causing the embroidery frame to move predetermined discreet dis tances.
