## Description
POST TREATMENT OF PERPENDICULAR MAGNETIC RECORDING MEDIA This invention relates to a magnetic recording medium and methods of post treatment of the magnetic layer of such a medium after initial fabrication to improve its perpendicular magnetization for high density recording of signals. In the technology of conventional magnetic recording using tape, sheet or disk recorders in video, audio or other digitized information storage, the signals are recorded on a magnetic recording layer formed on a non magnetic base by magnetizing the layer in the plane of the film in a longitudinal direction, which direction is parallel to the direction of relative movement of the medium to the recording transducer or head. This has been referred to as the longitudinal magnetization mode. In a recording process, the information or bit to be stored is recorded by changing the state or direction of the magnetization, ie. a bit of information is created by reversing the magnetization direction of the magnetic medium or creating a flux reversaLWhen recording in the longitudinal magnetization mode, a strong demagnetising field is created between oppositely magnetized areas on the medium.The existence of this demagnetising field in the logitudinal magnetization recording mode causes attenuation and rotation of the residual magnetization, with the result that an attenuated output is obtained in reproduction of the recorded signaL This attenuation and signal deterioration is accentuated as the linear packing density is increased or the wavelength of recorded signals is decreased in the direction of longitudinal magnetization.The consequence is a limitation on the maximum recording density in the longitudinal magnetization mode. If the magnetic layer can support principally a magnetization normal to the film plane, then, if signals are recorded by reversing the magnetization direction in the direction normal to the surface of the magnetic layer following the pattern of the signal i.e. recording in the sowalled perpendicular magnetization mode , decreasing the wavelength of the recorded signal, as by increasing the recording density, causes a reduction in the demagnetizing field. Therefore, it will be appreciated that, for an increase in the density of information to be stored in a given area of the magnetic recording medium, recording in the perpendicular magnetization mode hereinafter referred to as perpendicular recording is more advantageous than the conventional recording using longitudinal magnetization mode hereinafter referred to as longitudinal recording . In order to overcome the problems associated with the existing proposed methods of producing a magnetic recording medium for perpendicular recording, the present invention provides a method to produce such a magnetic recording medium having a highly oriented easy axis of magnetization perpendicular to film plane and which can be fabricated at an extremely low cost, rendering it highly adaptive to and competitive for a multitude of perpendicular recording applications. According to this invention, the method of this invention relates to treatment of a continuous thin film magnetic medium comprising a substrate upon which is deposited a thin magnetic layer comprising acicular shaped crystalline magnetic particles, with the crystallographic c axis of the crystal in each particle oriented parallel to the longitudinal axis of the particle acicula and the logitudinal axis of the acicular particles oriented substantially normal to the plane of said magnetic layer.The treatment method increases the separation between magnetic particles of the film and thereby increases their coercivity, Hc, while decreasing their demagnetization field, Hd. The method comprises the step of utilizing enhanced grain boundary reaction at the intergranular boundary of said particles to achieve particle separation effectively either by diffusing the magnetic layer with a reagent or etching the magnetic layer with an etching agent. According to this invention, various kinds of treatment of thin magnetic films or layers, such as, Co or Co alloy based thin magnetic films, can improve the magnetization properties of the thin films by providing large intergranular separation between the perpendicular particles of the magnetic layer and further enhance the perpendicular magnetization hysteretic properties of perpendicular recording medium. The treatments are not limited to the particular method of fabrication discussed herein but are applicable to other perpendicular recording media fabricated by other methods, such as, sputtering or vacuum deposition, as long as the resultant film has the above mentioned perpendicular anisotropic properties.

Fig 1 illustrates a magnetic recording medium 10 comprising this invention This illustration is materially enlarged for purposes of better understanding the microstructure and properties of the magnetic recording layer 14. Layer or film 14 is deposited on the conductive support 12 by an electrochemical plating process.The conditions of the plating process should be selected such that the microstructure of the resulting magnetic film 14 will result in a multitude of substantially uniform acicular or columnar shaped crystallites or particles 16, with both the longitudinal axis of the acicula and the crystallographic c axis 18 of the particles 16 oriented perpQdicular to the plane of the film.The crystalline materials comprising the film 14 under discussion here in and the later examples are HCP Co or Co based alloy particles. Examples of Co based alloys are CoRe, CoCr and CoNi.The film particles 16 are physically separated by impurities or voids 20 which exist in the grain boundary 22 between particles. If the medium consists of isolated acicular particles 16 having both the preferred oriented columnar shape and the crystal anisotropy shown in Fig. 1, the magnetic layer or film 14 will have strong uniaxial anisotropy with the easy axis of magnetization normal to the film plane, which renders the electroplated film highly suitable for perpendicular recording. By perfect preferred anisotropy , it is meant that the particles 16 have their crystal c axis 18 orientation substantially along the longitudinal axis of each acicular particle as well as the longitudinal axis of each acicular particle 16 aligned normal substantially perpendicular to the plane of the film 14.Fig. 2 illustrates the ideal magnetic hysteresis loop representing the relation between the applied magnetic field, H, and magnetization, M, of the recording layer, as measured by a vibrating sample magnetometer over a large area of a film. Hysteresis loop 24 in solid line represents the ideal hysteresis characteristic for the perpendicular 1 magnetization direction when the magnetic film has a uniaxial anisotropy normal to the film plane and hysteresis loop 26 in dotted line represents the ideal hysteresis characteristic for the longitudinal ill magnetization direction of the same film.The ideal perpendicular hysteresis loop 24 of the bulk film would be a parallelogram, i. e., slanted from a rectangle because of the demagnetizing field Hd effect along the direction opposed to the easy magnetizing direction, If one considered only an individual magnetic particle without the demagnetizing field effect from the bulk of the film, the intrinsic hysteresis loop of the particle for a high uniaxial anisotropic film should be of rectangular shape without any slanting, as illustrated by the hysteresis loop 28 in Fig. 3. For a high density recording or short wavelength, A , recording, the linear distance between reversed magnetization regions becomes quite small and hence the demagnetizing field, Hd, within a single magnetized bit area reduces or approaches zero with shortening wavelength. Consequently, the magnetic hysteresis loop of such a magnetized area under high density recording will behave as an intrinsic loop 28 illustrated in Fig. 3. The remnant, MrX of the magnetized area will approach the value of the saturation magnetization, MS, of the magnetized area. It is this physical fact of correlating the magnetic hysteresis loop of the bulk film to the intrinsic loop of the magnetized bit area that impels the search for obtaining a better perpendicular recording medium by determining whether the perpendicular hysteresis loop of the bulk film, as measured from a vibrating sample magnetometer, results in a good parallelogram shaped hysteresis loop 30 of Fig. 3, which is similar shape to that represented by loop 24 of Fig. 2.Basically, the slanting of the hysteresis loop 30 of the bulk film or long wavelength recording area, from the rectangular intrinsic loop 28 is caused by the demagnetizing field, Hd. In principle, the extent of the demagnetizing field, Hd, can be reduced by either decreasing the magnetization, M5, of the medium by means of doping with an alloy element, such as Cr or Re, or by increasing the separation between the particles 16, i.e., increasing the magnitude of the grain boundary 22. In the case of reducing demagnetizing field, Hd, by doping of alloy element, the extent of the slanting cannot necessarily be reduced, whereas in the case of reducing demagnetizing field, Hd, by increasing separation between crystallities would decrease fle extent of slanting drastically.In general, for a practical and useful film having good perpendicular anisotropy but accompanied with a strong demagnetizing field, Hd, in the perpendicular direction, perpendicular magnetization hysterisis loops as measured from the bulk film, in pracice, would show some inclination and the parallel loop would show some remanent magnetism. A typical example of these parallel 11 and perpendicular I magnetization hysteresis loops are respectively illustrated in Fig. 4A as loops 32 and 34. The amount of the inclination and the relative inclination between the two loops is related to the strength of demagnetizing field,Hd, in the film.If the demagnetizing field in the perpendicular direction is reduced by increasing its interparticle separation of the magnetic particles, then the perpendicular hysteresis loop 34 would decrease in inclination, as well as increasing in coercivity, Hc, whereas the parallel hysteresis loop 32 would increase in inclination. The resultant relative position and shape of these parallel il and perpendicular 1 hysteresis loops would be changed, for example, to look like the hysteresis loops 32 and 34 illustrated in Fig. 4B.The decrease in the inclination and the increase in He of the perpendicular loop 34 would imply that the medium could support a longer wavelength recording without causing self demagnetization of magnetized areas, thereby increasing the reliability and accuracy of recorded bit information.We have discovered an economical electroplating method for producing a magnetic recording film having the above mentioned film properties with preferred oriented crystallities in both the shape and crystallographic directions while reducing the demagnetizing field, Hd, in the perpendicular direction by means of controlling the separation between acicular magnetic particles through the control of the plating conditions as well as enhanced by treatment of the electroplated film.The electroplating method for producing the film 14 can be camed out in the apparatus 40 shown in Fig. 5. A Co or Co based alloy film 14 is formed from a plating bath 44 contained in the plating tank 42. For the case of aCo film, the plating electrolyte for bath 44 may comprise a cobalt salt solution, such as, for example, cobalt sulfate, cobalt chloride, cobalt sulfamate or cobalt perchlorate. Anode 46 may consist of a Co metal sheetCathode 48 comprises a conductive support, which is substrate 12.Electroplating is performed upon application of a voltage applied between anode 46 and cathode 48 supplied from a D.C. electrical source 50.Under these electroplating conditions, the Co ions in the bath solution will form the hydroxide ions, such as Co OH or Co4 OH 44 , and move or migrate toward the cathode 48 to accept electrons and reduce the hydroxide ions to Co and deposit on substrate 12 cathode 48 as Co metal, following the chemical reaction Co OH 2e b COO deposited metal OH 1 In the chemical reaction of equation 1 , accompanying the deposition of each metallic COO atom on substrate 12, there will be a free OH ion produced As the deposition continues, there will be an excess OH ion concentration at the particle growth interface 52 near or in proximity to the surface of the substrate.This excess OH ion concentration is illustrated at 54 in Fig. 6. Referring to Fig. 6 and, following the principle of concentration gradient, driven diffusion mechanism associated in a chemical reaction processes, the excess OH ion concentration 54, which is a concentration higher than that present in the bulk of the bath solution, at the particle growth interface 52 will migrate away from the center portion of the growth front 52 of the particles 16 into the bulk of the bath solution 44, as illustrated by arrows 58 in Fig. 6. Also this migration will occur into the intergranular boundary regions 56, i.e., at the edges between adjacent particles 16 near the particle growth interface 52, as illustrated by arrows 60 in Fig. 6, where no real or significant Co deposition occurs.It is known that in a cobalt salt solution, if the pH value pH being indicative of the concentration of H and OF ions in the solution is near or exceeds a value of about 7, the Co OH ions in the solution would precipitate out of solution as Co OH 2 following the chemical reaction Co OH OW B Co OH 2 4 2 atpH, 7 If the electroplating bath has a pH of less than 7, for example, about 6 or 6.5, then there will be no Co OH 2 precipitation occurring in the bulk of the bath solution.However, during plating of the film from a bath having such a pH level, the concentration of OF ions in the grain boundary regions 56 near the particle growth interface 52 would gradually build up because of the continuous migration of continually developed OH ions at the particle growth interface 52 into the grain boundary regions 56 and bulk solution 44, as previously described. If the accumulation of OH ion concentration in the grain boundary regions 56 near the particle growth interface 52 becames high enough to cause the pH value of the solution in that region to exceed the value of approximately 7, then the precipitation ofCo OH 2 in that region will occur. This precipitation is indicated by arrow 61 in Fig. 6.Under these particular growth conditions, a cellular or columnar type microstructure of Co particles can be produced. If the deposition of the particles is continued for a sufficient period of time until the film thickness is of the order of 1 Fm or less, for example, the particles would have an acicular shape with the long axis of the acicula and the crystallographic c axis 18 of the HCP Co particles oriented preferentially normal to the film plane. Furthermore, the particles would be separated physically from the surrounding particles by a large integranularboundary 22.Within this boundary, there would be either deposited precipitates of non magnetic Co OH 2 or voids left behind by unreacted solution. The deposited precipitates of non magnetic Co OH 2 will form at the immediate regions of the integranu lar boundary 22, as indicated by arrow 61, because of the higher pH value at this point compared with the bath solution bulk, i e., the pH value at this region is above whereCo OH 2 precipitation will occur. However, the pH value of the bath solution bulk is still below the value at which the precipitation of Co OH 2 would occur in the bulk solution. Generally, the width of the particles 16 and the extent of separation between the particles, i.e., the width of the intergranular boundary 22 in the plated film 14, may be controlled by varying the electroplating bath conditions, such as, by the concentration of Co ions in the plating solution, pH value of the solution, the temperature of the electroplating bath or by the deposition rate of the particles as defined by the current density of the electroplating process. The length of the acicular particles 16 or the thickness of the film 14 is principally determined by the length of time of electroplating.The length to width ratio of the particles may be, for example, 3 LFor the purpose of obtaining a practical perpendicular recording medium 10, the crystallites or particles 16 in the plated film 14 should not only have a strong perpendicular anisotropy to overcome the demagnetization energy but also the demagnetizing field in the particles should be reduced as much as possible, i.e., the inclination of the perpendicular hystersis loop should be as small as possible, and the coercivity, Hc, of the perpendicular hystersis loop should be strong enough to support perpendicular magnetization but small enough to be within the acceptable limits of the applied magnetic field strength produced by a magnetic recording headTo produce a film with strong uniaxial anisotropy, reduced demagnetizing field and controlled coercivity, the microstructure of the film, such as, the width and length of the acicular particles, the separation between the particles and the orientation of the crystallographic wcw axis and the long axis of the acicular particles, must be controlled In principle, these microstructure parameters can be changed or controlled, based on the previously explained mechanism of electroplating, through controlled electroplating conditions, that is, the concentration of Cho ions, buffer solutions, pH values, bath temperature, current density and additional alloying elements in the form of ionic species in the bath solutionExamples of the range of the plating parameters employed in the media and method of this invention, for purposes of illustration and not limitation, are as follows 1 Co ion concentration in the bath solution about 0.1 to 2 molar solutions, 2 Buffer reagent from no buffer reagent at all to about 0.5 molar H3BO3 or equivalent The employment of a buffer reagent permits the ultization of higher current densities and, therefore, higher plating deposition rates. 3 pH value about 5 to 6.7 or near the maximum pH value before the precipitation of Co OH 2 will occur in the solution bulL 4 Bath temperature from about room temperature 22 C or 230C to about 700C. 5 Current density from about 1 to 200 mA cm2. 6 Alloying elements from no added alloying element to about 208 of secondary plating element ion in the Co plating solution Examples of alloying elemental ions that may be used are Uni , Cr , Re , Os , Ru , Pd , Mn , Me , Cu , or other elements that would form solid solutions with Co under electroplating conditions. As an example of the preferred embodiment of the invention, the magnetic layer 14 contains substantially pure Co acicular shaped particles plated from simple Co salt solutions and having a total thickness, for example, of about 100 nm to several pm. The selection of preferred plating parameters for producing a magnetic film having the prescribed particle microstructure can be selected in a wide range of conditions for each of pararneters specified in the previous paragnph However, if one chooses to reduce the demagnetising field, Hd, relative to each magnetic particle by increasing the separation between the acicular shaped particle rather than by reduction of the saturation magnetization through alloying, a post electroplating treatment may be employed to enhance the size of the grain boundary 22 between the particles Several such treatments are possible. These treatments are based on the principles of enhanced grain boundary diffusion and enhanced grain boundary etching.These treatments are explained in conjunction with the schematic illustrations of Figs. 7 and 8.Fig. 7 illustrates the change in particle microstructure during the enhanced grain boundary diffusion treatment of the electroplated film 14. A magnetic film 14 electroplated on the surface of the substrate 12 is placed in an environment comprising a reactant, R, and identified at 63. The reactant may be a gas, such as, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen or other diffusing agent or the vapor phase of an element that is dissimilar to the film materiaL If the kinetics for diffusion of the reactant 63 aresufficiently high, then the reactant 63 would undergo a solid state diffusion into the particle 16 of the film 14. This diffusion is either through the exposed surface of the particle and directly into the particle bulk, as indicated by the arrows 62, or initially through the grain boundary 22 and then into the particle bulk, as indicated by the arrow 64.As the reactant 63 diffuses into the Co or Co based alloy particles 16, it forms a nonmagnetic phase compound or solid solution, identified as region 66, with the Co or Co alloy around the exterior regions of each particle, leaving the nondisturbed magnetic particle or core portion 68.The diffusion of a second species into the particle will be more than one order of magnitude faster along the grain boundary 22 via path 65 than directly into the bulk of the particle via path 62 or transversely into the particle side walls via paths 64. Therefore, the enhanced grain boundary diffusion treatment will create a layer of nonmagnetic phase around each particle 16, illustrated by shaded region 66 of Fig. 7. Consequently, the untouched magnetic material in the core portion 68 of each particle which has not been exposed to the diffusion treatment will retain its original magnetic moment and acicular shape. The effective magnetic separation between adjacent magnetic core portions 68 of the particles 16 will be increased because of the formation of the nonmagnetic phase portion 66 in the region between the particle core portions 68.This increase in the separation between the original magnetic particles 16 will result in a reduction of the demagneti sing field, Hd, of each particle and a corresponding increase in its coercivity.In one of these enhanced grain boundary diffusion treatments, an oxidation treatment at elevated temperature can be employed. There are several advantages in employing this type of oxidation as a film treatmentFirst, the heat treatment of the particles will subject them to an annealing effect As a result, improved HCP Co alloy particles can, in principal, be achieved due to reduction in crystal strain and or stacking faults in the particles. Secondly, the annealing effect would also increase the crystalline anisotropy. Third, the formation of the intergranular oxide along the grain boundaries and grain front of the particles provides a harder and more stable film, increasing its archival properties.Another treatment for increasing the effective separation between the magnetic particles 16 is by employing enhanced grain boundary etching of the plated film 14 which is schematically illustrated in Fig. 8.If polycr stalline materials, such as particles 16, are subjected to etching by a conventional chemical or electrochemical process with a properly selected chemical reagent, the rate of removal of total material is faster along the grain boundary 22 than at the regions on the surface of the particles 16, i e., the region of terminated particle growth at interface 52 in immediate contact with the etching reagent When an electroplated film 14 on an accompanying substrate 12 is placed in a chemical or electrochemical etching solution comprising an etching reagent, E, identified at 70 in Fig. 8, the reagent 70 immediately attacks the particle 16 at the grain front 72 at the surface of the particle as well as along grain boundary 22. In a film 14 comprising crystallographic c axis preferred oriented particles, the rate of removal of the magnetic material along the grain boundary 22 and in the vicinity or regions 74 of the grain boundary 22 would be greater than the grain front 72 This is because 1 the grain boundary 22 possesses higher free energy and, consequently, tends toward a greater rate of etching than the grain section proper of the particles and 2 the grain boundary 22 of the electroplated film includes inclusions, such as, Co OH 2, which are highly soluble in the acid solution and, hence, open up the grain boundary regions for the attending etchantConsequently, the particle material 75, indicated by the dotted boundary portions 76, is removed from the particles 16, leaving a core portion 78 of each particle intact if the etching process is stopped at a proper time.The core portion 78 of the particles will retain their original magnetic moment and acicular shape but have a larger interparticle separation as is evident from Fig. 8. The effective magnetic separation between adjacent magnetic core portions 78 of the particles 16 will be increased because of the removal of the portions 75 in the regions surrounding the particles. This increase in the separation between the magnetic particles will result in a reduction of the demagneti sing field, Hd, of each particle.It should be noted that particle separation may be further extended by a combination of either intergranular diffusion or oxidation and chemical etchingIt should be pointed out that the treatments for electroplated films we propose here for the reduction of demagnetizing field of the particles by the enhanced grain boundary diffusion or enhanced grain boundary etching can also be applied to magnetic films initially prepared by other methods of fabrication, such as, for example, sputtered CoCr or CoRe alloy films or vacuum deposited magnetic alloy films, as long as the microstructure of the particles in the film exhibit columnar or acicular shaped structures with the longitudinal axis of the columnar or acicular particles and the c axis of the HCP particle crystal comprising the particles are oriented normal to the plane of the film. The nonmagnetic substrates 12 that may be employed with the film 14 of this invention may take the form of a rigid support, for example, a rigid plate, disk, drum or sheet of aluminum or aluminum alloy, copper, brass or glass overcoated with a conductive metallic layer or the like. The metallic or non metallic substrate may be overcoated 1 with a conductive nonmagnetic, hard metallic layer for increasing the mechanical properties of the resultant magnetic medium or 2 a conductive magnetic layer to provide high permeability and low coercivity, such as permalloy as proposed in U.S. Patent 4,210.946, for increasing the effectiveness of recording and playback by a magnetic head.Alternatively, a nonmagnetic substrate may take the form of a flexible support, for example. a floppy disk or sheet or a tape of a synthetic resin fihn, comprised of a polyimide, polyethylene terephthalate, polycarbonate and the like, overcoated with a conductive metallic layer or the like, as previously mentioned for rigid supports. The fabrication of magnetic recording media according to the invention will be further illustrated with reference to . specific examples. Examples 1 through 5 illustrate samples of the electroplating method. Examples 6 through 9 illustrate samples of post treatments. These examples are for purposes of clarity and exemplification of the claimed invention without intentionally placing precise limitations on its parameters and utility. Many different parameter choices can easily be made, as will be clear from an examination of the examples, as well as changed in magnitude relative to each other. In some cases, these parameters may be substituted or eliminated.In any event the desired performance and function for recording media suitable for perpendicular recording will be obtained, as would be ordinarily appreciated by those skilled in the electroplating and in the magnetic recording technologies. I. Electroplated Films Example 1A nonmagnetic conductive support was used for the recording medium 10.The support comprised a glass substrate 12 overcoated with vacuum deposited Cr and Cu. This is followed by the deposition of a layer of nonmagnetic Ni P which is deposited by conventional electroless processThe purpose of the Cr, Cu and Ni P layers is to provide the substrate with good adhesion and electrically conductive properties to function as cathode 48 in the electroplating apparatus 40.The conductive surface substrate was then placed as the cathode of the electroplating bath 44. A pure Co sheet was used as anode 46 for the bath 44. The plating bath solution comprised 1 mole liter cobalt sulfamate, 0.15 mole liter cobalt chloride, CoCl2, and the pH of the solution was adjusted to the value of 65 using a saturated barium hydroxide solution This bath was designated as Bath L for record purposes.The Co platings were produced with current density in the range between 2.5 mA cm2 to 50 mA cm2 at two different bath temperatures of 230C and 500 C1 as specified in the following Tables I and II.

Two typical traces of the diffraction patterns obtained are shown in Figs. 9A and 9B for purposes of comparison. Fig. 9A is the diffraction pattern obtained from sample 09168005 in Table I whereas Fig. 9B shows the diffraction pattern obtained from sample 091980 01 in Table II. Based on the results of the x ray diffraction, the orientation of the particles in the Co film of the sample represented by Figs. 9A and 9B can be interpreted as follows. In the case of Fig. 9A, even though most of the particles in the film show strong preferred orientation of the c axis of the HCP crystallites, oriented normal to the film plane as revealed by the strong 002 diffraction line, there are also some crystallites in the film oriented with their a axis normal to the film plane as revealed by the presence of the 100 diffraction line in the pattern.On the other hand, for the sample represented by the pattern of Fig. 9B, all the crystallites in the film are oriented with their HCP c axis normal to the film plane as indicated by the very strong 002 diffraction and the lack of any other diffractions from the cobalt film in the diffraction pattern, particularly the lack of the 100 and 101 diffraction lines respectively at 41.50 and 47.5 , as indicated respectively by arrows 80 and 81. This means, then, that nearly all, if not fully all, the crystals are of preferred orientation desired for perpendicular recording.Basically, the extent of preferred crystallographic orientation of the crystallites in the Co films can be identified from the relative intensity of the characteristic x ray diffraction line of the HCP crystallite particles in the films. For example, the x ray diffraction pattern of Co films having randomly oriented crystallites would show relative diffraction line intensities of 20 , 60 and 100 for the respective characteristic diffraction lines of 100 002 and 101 crystallographic planes. For a film having preferred crystallographic orientation of the Co crystallites in the film, the relative peak intensity of these diffraction lines would be changed from that of a film having randomly oriented crystallites.When a film having the crystallites with the c axis oriented more in a direction normal to the film plane than the case of random orientation, the corresponding diffraction intensity of the 002 line will be increased and the intensity of other diffraction lines would decrease from thattof a Co film having randomly oriented crystallitesBased on this principle, it is possible to quantize the extent of preferred crystallographic orientations of the crystallites in the films obtained from different plating conditions by measuring and determining the ratio of the peak intensity value of a given characteristic diffraction, such as, the 002 , 100 or 101 diffraction lines, with the background fluorescence intensity at a given diffraction angle in order to normalize the intensity of the characteristic diffraction for a given film thickness. hgs. 10A and 10B respectively show the diffraction intensity ratio I 2 I and 1000 IBG where 1 002 and I 1o0 are the respective peak intensities of the 002 and 100 diffraction and IBG is the background intensity of the corresponding pattern taken at 20 390 diffractometer angle, employing Cu Ka radiation as a function of the plating current density for the I Fm thick Co films listed in Tables I and II.As illustrated from Fig. 10A, even though the films plated from the bath at room temperature 230C Table I showed strong preferred orientation of a majority of the crystallites with their c axis normal to the film plane, as indicated by the strong i oM InG ratio, all the films showed some of the crystallites oriented with the a axis of the crystallities in the direction normal to the film plane, as revealed by non existence of the kioo 1no intensity ratio. Furthermore, careful analysis of the diffraction patterns of this series of Co films shows that there is a small diffraction intensity of the 101 diffraction line. This would indicate that the films also have some small amount of particlesoriented with their crystallographic 11011 axis normal to the film plane.On the other hand, an examination of Fig. lOB forCo films plated from same L Bath at 500C Table 11 , the diffraction patterns show no 101 diffraction line. Also, when the plating current density was maintained below 20 mA cm2, the patterns show only a very strong 002 diffraction with higher intensity ratios as compared to Fig. 10A and, further, having no presence of either the 100 or 101 diffractionsThese results indicate that the Co films plated in the L Bath below 20 mA cm2 current density should have perfect anisotropic orientation of all the crystallites in the film oriented with the c axis perpendicular to the film plane. Films having this kind of preferred anisotropy in cyrstal orientation are highly adaptable for perpendicular recording media applications.These samples demonstrate that preferred anisotropic orientation of the crystallites can be achieved by the electroplating method of this invention.Fig. lOB further demonstrates that as the plating current density increases beyond 20 mA cm2, the electroplated film begins to lose its preferred anisotropic orientation of the crystallites with the existence of some crystallites with their a axis normal to the film plane, as evident by the appearance of I loo IBG intensity ratio in Fig. 10B above this current density point.One can conclude from these results of Example 1, based on the x ray diffraction analysis, that in employing this specific bath solution, Co films with preferred orientation may be obtained employing plating bath temperature of 500C and current density of between about 5 to 20 mA cm2.Furthermore, if the film is electroplated within this range of current density, for example, about lOmA cm2at 500C, the preferred orientation can be produced for film thicknesses ranging from about 0.5 to 2 un, as illustrated from the plot of the 1 002Y1BG and I loo IIBG ratios vs. film thickness from the data of Fig. 1 0c and Table II. Specificially, Fig. 10C is based on data obtained from samples 091980 07, 091980 08 and 091980 09 ofTable II. Examination of the microstructure of the films using a scanning electron microscope SEM shows that if a film has a preferred 002 orientation, the crystallites would have their acicular shape and the long axis of the acicular oriented also normal to the surface of the film, i.e., the long axis of acicular parallel to the c axis of the crystallite. The width of the acicular cyrstallities can be varied from a view tens to cover a hundred nrn, depending on the plating current density and bath temperature used during plating The SEM microstructure of a typical film having this type of preferred orientation of both crystallographic and shape anisotropy normal to the film plane is shown in Figs. 11A and 11B. The SEM microstructure, in this case, is taken from sample 091980 08 of Table II. Fig.11B is an increased magnification of a portion of the structure shown in Fig. llA. The perpendicular 1 magnetic hysteresis loops of a Co film having preferred orientation, i.e., a high 002 peak intensity and no or practically nonexistent 100 and 101 preferred orientation, shows good parallelogram definition with high coercivity, Ho equal to about 1.2kOe, as shown in Fig. 12B. The perpendicular 1 and parallel II hysteresis loops 86 and 88 are taken from sample 09198b02 of Table II. On the other hand, films having some crystallites oriented with their 100 or 101 axis normal to the filin plane, which is the case for all the electroplated films in Table I and also for the films electroplated with a current density of greater than about 20 mA cm2 in Table II, show poorer parallelogram definition for the perpendicular parallel hysteresis loops as that shown by the example of loop 82 in Fig. 12A. The perpendicular and hysteresis loops 82 and 84 are taken from sample 091980 05 of Table I.Even though these films show strong 002 preferred orientation as indicated in Figs. 10A and 10B, they exhibit poor parallelogram loops and lower coercivity values, such as, He equal to about 0.75 kOe. Example 2The same nonmagnetic conductive substrate 12 employed with the samples of Example 1 was employed with the samples of Example 2. The plating bath was also the same except for the molar content of the cobalt chloride.The plating bath solution comprised 1 molar cobalt sulfamate, 0.05 molar liter cobalt chloride, CoCI2, and the pH of the solution was adjusted by a 0.1 molar liter Ba OH 2 solution to a value of 6.5. This bath was designated as, Bath LC for record keeping purposesThree series of samples were prepared at temperatures of 22 C, 350C and S0 C. The results of each of these sample series is shown in Table III, IV and V.

The results of these three series of samples are plotted in terms of the I 002 IBG,I 100 IBG and I 10l IBG ratios vs. current density in Fig. 13.As shown in Fig. 13, the plated films from LC Bath demonstrate perpendicular anisotropy for a wide range of current densities, i.e., between 2 mA cm2 to 10 mA cm2 for a bath temperature of 22 , between 2 mA cm2 to 20 mA cm2 for a bath temperature of 350and between 2 mA cm2 to 70 mA cm2 for a bath temperature of 500. The current density gives a fairly constant extent of preferred orientation and anisotropy over a fairly wide range of bath temperatures and current densities for practical fabrication of large area films. Therefore, one need not be concerned about precise bath conditions, temperatures or appied current densities to obtain desired uniformity in the preferred orientation of the crystallites over large areas of the film in the media production process.Hence, the absence of precise control over bath temperatures and current densities drastically reduces the cost of the media fabrication process and media production while also permitting a more continously reproducible magnetic media productThe preferred orientated films show a good parallelogram conditions for the perpendicular magnetic hysteresis loops, as exemplified by the loops illustrated in Figs. 14A, B, C for three of the samples at respective bath temperatures of22 C, 350C and 50 C. Fig 14A shows the perpendicular and parallel magnetic hysteresis loops 90 and 92 for sample 110480 05 of Series 1 in Table III. The perpendicular magnetic hysteresis loop 90 shows good parallelogram definition with high coercivity, HCX equal to about 1.1kOe. Fig 14B shows the perpendicular and parallel magnetic hysteresis loops 94 and 96 for sample 120480 01 of Series 2 in Table IV. The perpendicular magnetic hysteresis loop 94 shows good parallelogram definition with high coercivity, H, equal to about 1.3kOe. Fig 14C shows the perpendicular and parallel magnetic hysteresis loops 98 and 100 for sample 120480 07 of Series 3 in Table V. The perpendicular magnetic hysteresis loop 98 shows good parallelogram definition with high coercivity, He equal to about 1.3kOe. Example 3The same nonmagnetic conductive substrate 12 employed with the samples of Examples 1 and 2 was also employed with the samples of Example 3However, the parameters of the plating bath used in Example 2 were changed and the bath was then designated as, Bath I for record keeping purposes. The plating bath solution comprised 1.7 molar liter cobalt sulfamate, 0.2 inolar liter cobalt chloride, CoCl2, and the pH of the solution was adjusted with a 0.1 Ba OTI 2 solution to a value 6.5. The results for the designated electroplated film samples are are set forth in Table VI.

The results of these samples are plotted in terms of the I 002 IBG and I 100 IBG ratios vs. the current densities in Fig 15.The plated Co films from I Bath electroplating demonstrate good parallelogram conditions for the perpendicular hysteresis loop and perpendicular anisotropy for a range of current densities, i.e., between about 4.8 mA cm2 to 10 mA cm2 for a bath temperature of 220. Again, a fairly constant extent of preferred orientation and anisotropy over a fairly wide range of current densities for practical fabrication of large area films is demonstrated.Based on the x ray diffraction analysis, Co films with preferred orientation, i.e. crystallographic c axis of all the crystallites in the film oriented normal to the film plane, may be obtained employing theI Bath with a plating bath temperature of 220C and a current density of between about 5 to 10 mA cm2. Above about 10 mA cm2, the 100 diffraction appears, indicating the presence of some particles with their c axis oriented in directions other than normal to the plane of the film. Example 4The same nonmagnetic conductive substrate 12 employed with the samples of previous Examples was also employed with the samples of Example 4.However, a different plating bath was used and was designated as, Bath A for record keeping purposes. The plating bath solution comprised 1 molar liter cobalt sulfate, CoS04, 0.1 molar liter cobalt chloride, Coo2, and the solution was buffered with 30 gramsfliter H3B03 and the pH of the solution was adjusted with NaOH solution to a value of 6.35. The results for the designated electroplated film samples are are set forth in Table VII.

Again, a fairly constant extent of preferred orientation and anisotropy over a fairly wide range of current densities for practical fabrication of large area films is demonstrated. Based on the x ray diffraction analysis, Co films with preferred orientation, i.e. crystallographic wc axis of all the crystallites in the film oriented normal to the film plane, may be obtained employing theA Bath with a plating bath temperature of 230C and a current density within the above mentioned range.Below about 40 mA cm2 and above about 70 mA cm2, the 100 diffraction appears, indicating the presence of some particle with c axis oriented in directions other than normal to the plane of the film.While the film samples of this example did exhibit preferred orientation with good parallelogram perpendicular loop conditions, the film samples did have slightly lower coercivity, Mc as compared to previous examplesFor example, the Hc for sample 082680 06 was about 650 Oe, for samples 082680 03 and 082680 04 about 700 Oe and for sample 082680 08 about 720Oe. Example 5 The plating conditions for obtaining a perfect preferred oriented Co film ofExample 1 were rerun with different types of nonmagnetic conductive supports. First, the substrate 12 in all cases was a conductive substrate.Secondly, the overcoatings were of three different types. Support A comprised an aluminum substrate overcoated with electroless copper followed by an overcoating of nickel phosphorus, NiP. Support B comprised a copper tape substrate overcoated with nickel phosphorus, NiP.Support C comprised an aluminum substrate overcoated with sputteredCo Re having preferred oriented HCP CoRe crystallites 200 nm thick with c axis of all the crystallites particle oriented normal to the film plane.The electroplated Co films produced at the designated current densities and film thicknesses of the samples in Tables I and II on supports A, B and C produced essentially same results, relative to hysteresis characteristics and preferred anisotropic orientation, i.e. crystallographic c axis and long axis of the acicular particle of all the crystallites in the film oriented normal to the film plane, as achieved with the glass supports with conductive coatings originally used in Example L II. Treatments Example 6This example relates to electroplated Co films followed by enhanced grain boundary reaction. The treatment is an enhanced grain boundary diffusion accomplished by an electrochemical cathodic treatment of the magnetic film The same nonmagnetic substrate 12 employed with the samples of Example 1 was employed with the samples of this Example 6. The plating bath was also the same except for the molar content of the cobalt chloride. The plating bath solution was identical to that of Example 2 and comprised 1 molar cobalt sulfamate, 0.05 molar liter cobalt chloride, CoC12, and the pH of the solution was adjusted by a 0.1 molar liter Ba OH 2 solution to a value of 6.5. This bath was designated as, Bath LA for record keeping purposes.The film plating conditions in all cases for the four samples inTable VIII, are that the bath temperature was 350C and the current density was 20 mA cm2. Film thicknesses were all about lprm Cathodic treatment comprises the employment of an acid solution of 0.1 mole liter of Thiorea and 30 cc liter of H2504 concentrated instead of solution 44 in the electroplating apparatus 40 of Fig 5. Upon the application of an applied voltage between the Co sample as cathode 48 and the anode 46, hydrogen generated by cathodic action of the solution will diffuse into the film. The rate of diffusion of hydrogen will be faster along the grain boundary 22 of the film 14 than into the crystallite bulk, particularly at the grain front 52.Consequently, the spacing between the acicular crystallites will be occupied by a nonmagnetic CoH compound or alloy thereby increasing the separation between the crystallites while decreasing the demagnetising field, Md. The current densities, treatment time and bath temperatures in the cathodic tratment for four samples are given in Table VIIL Table VIIICo Sample Current Total Treatment BathNumber Density Time w i 1 min Temperature 100180 01 0 0 250C 10038b05 4.5 mA cm2 4 min 250C 100680 05 4.5 mA cm2 8 min 250C 10068044 10 mA cm2 8 min 250C Fig 17A, B, C, and D show the perpendicular and parallel magnetic hysteresis loops for these four film samples, respectively.The hysteresis loop traces for comparison of sample 100380 04 in the case where no treatment is applied parallel II and perpendicular 1 loops 102 and 104 in Fig. 17A and of samples 100380 05, 100680 05 and 10068O04 in the cases where treatment is applied parallel Il and perpendicular 1 loops 106 and 108 in Fig. 17B, parallel ill and perpendicular 1 loops 114 and 116 in Fig. 17C and parallel II and perpendicular 1 loops 118 and 120 inFig. 17D , a slight increase in coercivity Hc, and a large decrease in demagnetizing field Hd as indicated by extensive decrease in inclination of the perpendicular hysteresis loops 108, 116 and 118 in Figs. 17B, C, D.Thus, the enhanced grain boundary diffusion by hydrogen cathodization effectively increases the intergranular separation while decreasing the demagnetising field and, hence increasing the Mr Ms ratio as well as increasing the coercivity, sic Cathodic treatment of other samples plated at higher current densities, for example, from above 20mA cm2 to 100mAJcm2, revealed that the effectiveness of this treatment to provide intergran ular crystallite separation was not as effective as in the case of sample plated at lower current densities, e. g., below 20 to 30 mA cm2, because of the existence of nonpreferred oriented particles in the film. Example 7This example relates to electroplated Co films followed by another kind of enhanced grain boundary reaction. The treatment is an enhanced grain boundary etching accomplished by an anodizing treatment of the magnetic filmThe same nonmagnetic substrate 12 employed with the samples of Example 1 was employed with the samples of this Example 7. The plating bath was also the same except for the molar content of the cobalt chloride. The plating bath solution was identical to that of Example 6 and comprised theLA Bath. The plating conditions in all cases for the three samples in TableIX are that the plating bath temperature was 500C and the current density was 40 mA cm2. Film thicknesses were all about 1pm. Three electroplated Co film samples with preferred orientation produced from the above bath were then secured on the anode 46 of the apparatus 40. Instead of solution 44, an acid bath comprising a solution of 0.1 mole liter of thiorea and 30 cc liter of concentrated H2504 is employed in the tank 42. In this arrangement, the material would preferentially etch away along the intergranularboundary 22 between the acicular particles under applied electrical current and thereby effectively increase the crystallite separatjon, Consequently the demagnetization field of the film will be decreased, Mr Ms ratio will be increased and He will be increased The current densities, anodizing time and bath temperatures for three samples are given in Table IX. Table IX Co Sample Current Total Treatment Bath Number Densitv Time w i 1 min Temperature 10138001 2.5 mA cm2 2 min 240C 10138003 2.5 mA cm2 5 min 240C 10138002 25 mA Cm2 8 min 244C Figs. 18A, B, and C show the parallel ill and perpendicular i magnetic hysteresis loops 122 and 124, 126 and 128, and 132 and 134, respectively, for these three film samples. It should be noted that anodization effectively reduces the demagnetising field, Md, as indicated by the decrease in inclination of perpendicular 1 hysteresis loops 124, 128 and 134 in comparison with the perpendicular 1 hysteresis loop 104 of the untreated film of Fig. 17A and, hence, increase the ratio of MVM5 and increase the coercivity, Hc, of the magnetic Co film by electrochemically etching away the material between the crystallities, which effectively increases their separation.This anodizing treatment and the cathodic treatment of Example 6 demonstrate that by using the technique of enhanced grain boundary etching under electrochemical method, the separation between the acicular crystallites can effectively increase and, hence, reduce the demagnetising effect as well as increase the values for Hc and Mr Therefore, one can use these treatment techniques to tailor a film for particular hysteresis properties desired for specific perpendicular recording applications. Example 8This example relates to electroplated Co films followed by still another kind of treatment. The treatment is an enhanced grain boundary etching accomplished by a chemical etching treatment of the magnetic film in an acid bath. The preferred oriented electroplated Co film fabricated in accordance with the LA Bath of Example 7 was used for the tt treatment of this Example 8. An etchant bath was prepared in an etching tank comprising concentrated M2504 solution of 0.1 mole liter. The film sample was placed in the acid bath and material was preferentially etched away along the grain boundary 22 at a faster rate than the bulk of the acicular crystallite.This resulted in increased intercrystallitic separation. Table X shows the etching treatment time and bath temperature for the sample. Table X Co Sample Total TreatmentNumber Time w i 1 min Temperature 101480 05 8 min 240C An examination of the parallel 11 hysteresis and perpendicular 1 loops 136 and 138, shown in Fig. 19 disclose a decrease in the demagnetising field, Hd, an increase in the Mr Ms ratio, and an increase in the Hc, as compared to an untreated Co film sample fabricated in the same LA BathHowever, the effect of this etching treatment is not as pronounced as the anodizing treatment of Example 7 for comparable times of treatment. Example 9As previously indicated, the treatments of Examples 6 through 9 are not limited to films produced by electroplating method described herein.These treatments may readily be applied to other magnetic films fabricated by other methods that provide the film with perpendicular anisotropy usefil for perpendicular recording. In this Example, enhanced grain boundary diffusion is applied to a film having perpendicular anisotropy fabricated from a conventional sputtering processSputtered Co Re alloy films were produced with conventional sputtering equipment to have preferred orientation in crystallographic and crystallite shape similar to that of the electroplated films previously discussed. The method and conditions of obtaining the preferred oriented film is similar to the process described in the previous publication entitled High Coercivity and High Hysteresis Loop Squareness of Sputtered Co Re Thin Film byTu Chen and G. B.Charlan published in the Journal of Applied iiysics, Volume 50, page 4285 et al., 1979. The sample produced for this example was sputtered from alloy target consisting of Co plus 10 atomic per cent Re.The sputtering was carried out under a 75 m argon pressure. The film was deposited on the glass substrate at 1000with deposition rate of 0.05 nm per second until a total film thickness of about 300 nm was achieved. The film as deposited showed perfect anisotropy with c axis of all crystallites in the film oriented normal to the film plane as revealed by the x ray diffraction method described in connection with Example 1 and Figs. 9A and 9B. In these films, perpendicular anisotropy with accompanying reduction of the demagnetizing field is accomplished by reducing the magnetization of the film through alloying Co with Re.Therefore, for these as deposited sputtered films, their demagnetising field Hd, and coercivity, Hc, cannot be improved beyond the limits of these properties now known to be obtained in conventional sputtered fabrication.For perpendicular recording media application, a further decrease in demagnetising effect and increase in the Mr M5ratio and He is often required for low frequency recording. Therefore, to further decrease the demagnetization field and increase the value of Mr M5 ratio and Hc of the film from the as sputtered state, the enhanced grain boundary diffusion treatment is applied as a post treatment to the previously sputtered Co Re film samples to increase the magnetic separation between the crystallities and thereby decrease the Hd and increase the Mr M5 ratio and theSpecifically in this example, a sputtered film designated as Co Re 12147801 was heat treated in an ambient atmosphere in a furnace at 3000C for 18 hours to enhance the grain boundary diffusion by oxidation.The results of the magnetic hysteresis measurements for the perpendicular I and parallel II hysteresis loops for the as deposited and oxidation annealing are shown, respectively, in Figs. 20A and 20B. By comparing the relative inclinations of parallel II loops 142 and 146 respectively for untreated and treated films with the inclinations of perpendicular 1 loops 144 and 148 respectively for untreated and treated films, it can be seen that the treated film shows a decrease in demagnetising field, as indicated by decrease in inclination of the perpendicular 1 loop 148 compared with the parallel loop 146. This thereby decreases the Hd and increases the Mr Ms ratio and the Hc. Specifically in this example, a sputtered film designated as Co Re 121478 01 was heat treated in an ambient atmosphere in a furnace at 3000C for 18 hours to enhance the grain boundary diffusion by oxidation.This illustrates that the enhanced grain boundary diffusion principle can also be applied also to sputtered films having perpendicular anistropy.Magnetic materials and alloys, other than Co or Co alloys, may be used.
