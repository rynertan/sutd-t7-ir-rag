# An ice machine.

## Abstract
In connection with an arrangement in an ice machine which comprises a series of substantially parallel vertically arranged ice freezing elements 1 which during the ice freezing phase are supplied with water, and which are provided with conduits 2 for transport of freezing medium or thawing medium, as well as vessels 5 arranged below the ice freezing elements 1 and adapted for collecting surplus water, and an ice crusher box 7 for crushing and delivery of finished produced ice 6a , there is between the bottom of the ice freezing elements 1 and the collecting vessels 5 for water and the ice crusher box 7 provided a pivotable baffle means 9 which effectively serves to sepa rate ice and water during the various steps of the ice producing process. During the ice freezing phase the baffle means 9 adopts an inclined position which covers the ice collecting vessel 7 , so as to pass the surplus water to the water collecting vessels 5 via a stationary inclined guiding plate 3 having a water pervious field 4 . During the ice harvesting phase when the water supply is shut off, the pivotable baffle means 9 will under the weight of the ice crop 6a be allowed to swing from its inclined basic posi tion to an approximately vertical position and permit the ice flakes 6a to be passed to the ice crusher box 7 , whereaf ter the pivotable baffle means 9 subsequent to the finished harvesting phase will retain its original inclined position covering the ice crusher box.
