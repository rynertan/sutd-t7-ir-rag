## Description
ADSORBENTS OR SORBENTS This invention relates to adsorbents or sorbents suitable for use in heat pumps. Zeolite molecular sieves which are suitable for use in adsorption heat pumps are produced as very fine powders of about 5 microns particle size. Usually these powders are pelletised and this is often achieved by the addition of 20 by weight of an inert binder. It is possible as an alternative to use pelleted zeolite molecular sieve but although easier to handle than powder it costs about four times the price of the raw material and is less reactive as an adsorbent. Both powder and pellets suffer from two physical limitations which affect their performance in heat pumps and hence the size and costs of such devices. These limiting factors are the permeability to gaseous adsorbate and the thermal conductivity of the adsorbent. In accordance with this invention these limitations are substantially overcome by the use in a heat pump of an adsorbent or sorbent mass comprising a mass of metal having open pores or interstices wherein said pores or interstices are occupied by an adsorbent or sorbent comprising alumina, zeolite molecular sieve, activated charcoal, an alkaline earth metal halide or a mixture thereof, the adsorbent or sorbent mass having 2 to 13 by weight of metal,and the metal having a melting point greater than 400 C. The amount of metal will often be between 2 and 10 wt. of the adsorbent or sorbent mass. The mass of metal can take various forms but will usually be a mass of metal fibres, for example wire wool, or a metal sponge. In all cases it is essential that the pores or interstices are open so that liquid coming into contact with the mass of metal is able to penetrate substantially all of the pores or interstices. The metal should preferably have a high conductivity and should not be corroded when it comes into contact with adsorbate, e.g.water or methyl alcohol. Preferred metals are copper, bronze, iron alloys and a uLinium or its alloys, Preferably the metal should have a melting point greater than 600 C. The shape of the mass of metal can vary but it is obviously desirable if its shape corresponds with the volume of the adsorber or sorber or tray of the adsorber or sorber which it is desired to fill with adsorbent or sorbent. In some cases it may be desirable to pack this volume with more than one individual mass of metal. If the mass of metal is flexible as in the case of wire wool, then the actual shape of the mass of metal is not of great significance. The adsorbent or sorbent has to be alumina, a zeolite molecular sieve, an alkaline earth metal chloride or activated charcoal. The preferred adsorbent is zeolite molecular sieve and the A and Y varieties are particularly suitable. Zeolites are natural hydrated silicates of aluminium and either sodium Y type or calcium A type or both of the type Na20.A1203.nSi02.xH20 or an artificial ion exchange resin. Molecular sieves are zeolites wherein the dehydrated crystals are interlaced with regularly spaced channels of molecular dimensions which comprise almost 50 of the total volume of crystals. Although when using an alkaline earth metal halide, in certain circumstances magnesium chloride could be used for example, it is preferred to use calcium chloride. In order to fill the pores or interstices with adsorbent or sorbent the method of forming an adsorbent or sorbent mass comprising a metal and adsorbent or sorbent is one wherein a slurry of powdered adsorbent or sorbent comprising alumina, a zeolite molecular sieve, activated charcoal, an alkaline earth metal chloride or a mixture thereof is allowed to flow into a mass of metal having open pores or interstices and a melting point greater than 4000c, said mass occupying a vacuum filter of the shape and size of the desired adsorbent or sorbent mass, and the liquid of the slurry is allowed to filter through the mass of metal. The slurry can be formed using any suitable liquid which is relatively volatile e.g. water, a monohydric alcohol, e.g. methanol a ketone, e.g. methyl ethyl ketone, or mixtures or azeotropes thereof. Usually the slurry will contain 5 to 25 by weight of adsorbent or sorbent. When the liquid has filtered with the aid of the partial vacuum, one is left with a filter cake comprising the mass of metal impregnated with the adsorbent or sorbent. Usually, the adsorbent or sorbent is not tightly bonded to the mass of metal. If desired this cake can be dried before being transferred to an adsorber or sorber. However, it could be advantageous to transfer the adsorbent or sorbent cake in the moist condition in order to avoid spilling of the powder.In this case it would be advantageous if the liquid used to form the slurry is the adsorbate or sorbate, e.g. water. When the adsorbent or sorbent cake is transferred to the adsorber or sorber in the moist condition it will be dried out during the first operating cycle. When subjected to heat in the adsorber or sorber, the porous metal or metal fibres will expand and this may well produce extensive cracking. This will be an advantage because the channels opened up in this way will enhance the permeability of the cake toEMI4.1 gaseous adsorbateXand so increase the maximum available output of any heat pump of which the adsorber forms a part. In order to obtain the best thermal conductivity it is preferable if the fibres of wire wool are bonded to the plate, e.g. metal plate, which supplies heat to the sorbent substantially at right angles thereto, i.e. rather like the bristles of a brush.Accordingly when carrying out the method of the invention using wire wool, it is preferable if the skeins of wire wool are folded like a concertina with the bulk of the loops located substantially at right angles to the plate which will ultimately supply heat to the adsorbent or sorbent mass. The slurry is then allowed to flow into the wire wool as previously described. The adsorbent mass of this invention is used in an adsorber.In such adsorbers the adsorbent adsorbs adsorbate with the evolution of heat. To desorb the adsorbate external heat must be applied to the adsorbent mass. The advantages of using the adsorbent or sorbent mass of this invention are that compared with previously used adsorbents or sorbents,, the thermal conductivity is greatly improved and one can use smaller particles and hence improve the rate of adsorption.The result is that the heat can be removed faster and when used in a heat pump there is a higher temperature lift. Processes and apparatus where adsorbers are used and where the adsorbent mass of this invention could be used include our UK patent applications 8026322, 8029278, 8038283, 8039157 and 8111392.

Application 8111392 claims a method of obtaining heat wherein adsorbate is evaporated from an evaporator and thereafter zd30rbed by an adsorbent in an adsorber, the latent heat of adsorption providing heat to the load and thereafter the adsorbate is desorbed from the adsorbent and desorbed adsorbate condensed in a heat of fusion heat store and the substance housed therein melting and thereafter solidifying, the latent heat of fusion providing heat to the load.Example 4A zeolite molecular sieve powder was poured into a measuring cylinder and was found to give a packing factor of 0.60, packing factor being the proportion of the total volume occupied by the relevant material, i.e. by 4A zeolite in this case, A skein of copper wire wool was measured and weighed and was found to have a packing factor of 0.027,Some of the copper wire wool was put into a beaker where it had a packing factor of 0.0102. A slurry of 10 of zeolite in water was then poured into the beaker and allowed to settle. The supernatant water was then decanted and the process was repeated until the copper wool was submerged by settled zeolite. The water was then evaporated by heating the heater to 3000C and allowing it to cool in a closed container. It was then weighed and it was established that the packing factor of the zeolite in the free volume was 0.60. On a weight basis the matrix contained 12.7 by weight of copper.
