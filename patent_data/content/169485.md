# Method and apparatus for inducing photochemical reaction.

## Abstract
In a method and apparatus for inducing a photochemical reaction, wherein a substrate 5 is placed in a closed cell 10 with a window 10A for transmitting an ultraviolet beam therethrough, the substrate 5 being located to oppose the window 10A , a gas is filled to cause the photochemical reaction upon radiation of the ultraviolet beam in the cell 10 , ultraviolet pulses with adjustable repetition frequency at a predetermined intensity are emitted, so that the ultraviolet beam having the set beam size and shape at the repetition frequency is irradiated through the window 10A of the cell 10 , an ultraviolet beam size and shape are adjusted in accordance with a size and shape of an irradia tion portion of the substrate 5 and the repetition frequency of the ulraviolet beam is adjusted and set to effectively cause the photochemical reaction on the substrate 5 in accord ance with the adjusted ultraviolet beam size and shape.
