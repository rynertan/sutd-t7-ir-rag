# A method of and apparatus for monitoring the operation of an internal combustion engine and a motor vehicle having an internal combustion engine monitored by such apparatus.

## Abstract
A monitoring device 100 for monitoring the operation of a vehicle internal combustion engine having inlet ducting 102 for admitting a fuel air mixture into the engine com prises vacuum sensitive means 112.1, 112.2 for sensing the degree of vacuum in the inlet ducting, speed sensitive means 154 for sensing the rotational speed of the engine, and warn ing means including gates 152.1, 152.2, 152.3 , multivibrator circuitry 146 , a loudspeaker 148 , and a recorder 150 . When the degree of vacuum falls below a predetermined vacuum value, warning bleeps are issued by the loudspeaker 148 and recordings are made on the recorder 150 . The warning means is operative in response to the vacuum sensi tive means and the speed sensitive means to provide a pre determined vacuum value which is a stepwise increasing function of rotational speed sensed. An inclined mercury containing capsule 160 is provided to inhibit bleeping and recording when the vehicle is inclined at more than a predetermined angle to the horizontal in the direction of travel of the vehicle.
