# Visor assembly.

## Abstract
A visor assembly 21 for a vehicle 10 comprising at least a pair of substantially parallel arms 26, 28 each pivotally coupled at one end 27, 29 to a mounting structure 22 secured to a vehicle headliner 18 and having opposite ends 31, 33 pivotally secured to a visor panel or a sun shield 24 such that the shield can be translated by rotation of the parallel arms between a raised stored position and a lowered use positon. A spring 36 extends to impart a force to the shield, tending to return the shield to a stored position. Releasable latching means 60 hold the shield in a lowered use position and can be operator actuated or automatically actuated for example by a solenoid assembly 70 when the vehicle doors open to allow the spring to return the shield to the stored position permitting easy exit from the vehicle.
