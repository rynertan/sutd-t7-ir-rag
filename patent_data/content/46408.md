# Transient energy control and suppression circuit.

## Abstract
Sinusoidal, direct current, or other power sources are maintained at or near their intended waveform even when attacked by transient voltage and current surges, and with out the dissipation of electrical transient surge energy in the electrical devices served by the power sources. Toward this end, a surge suppression circuit is provided which utilizes a low pass filter positioned electrically upstream of a transient surge suppression device having a prescribed response time. The electrical components of the low pass filter and the transient surge suppression device are so matched that the peak voltage or current of the transient waveform will not rise past prescribed limits until after a time lapse greater than the response time of the transient surge suppression device. The transient waveform is thus modified in shape so that overshoot energy will be dissipated in the transient surge suppression device rather than being passed on to the electrical device served, thereby preventing damage and eliminating wasteful energy loss.
