# Process for producing fine particles of ferromagnetic metal powder.

## Abstract
Improved acicular fine particles of ferromagnetic metal having superior powder characteristics and tape characteris tics are provided, which fine particles are prepared by adding to an aqueous suspension of acicular iron oxide or oxyhydro xide, a solution of a different kind and non alkali metal salt of an organic acid in place of conventional inorganic acids, followed by making the mixture basic and heat reduction.
