# AMPLIFYING ARRANGEMENTS

## Abstract
Klystrons are inherently non linear and have an amplific ation characteristic which is frequency dependent on both signal amplitude and beam current. This may be compensa ted for by applying suitable correcting signals to a beam con trolling electrode of the klystron thereby changing its electron beam current over the whole excursion of a modulating signal. A klystron arrangement in accordance with the inven tion is particularly suitable for use in a television transmitter, enabling full time modulation to be carried out with a signifi cant improvement in the operating efficiency of the klystron.
