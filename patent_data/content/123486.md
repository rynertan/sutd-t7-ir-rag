# Exothermic reactions.

## Abstract
The liquid medium of an exothermic process is cooled by including in the medium a particulate heat sink material, such as sodium sulphate decahydrate, that is substantially insolu ble in the medium and which undergoes an endothermic phase change. Either as a result of this endothermic change, or as a result of a subsequent exothermic change, the heat sink material is again solid particulate material substantially insoluble in the medium. It may remain in the medium, for the instance as a dispersion through a polymer gel, or it may be separated from the medium.
