## Description
METHOD FOR REMOVING IRON IMPURITIES FROM GLASS MAKING SAND Background of the Invention This invention relates to froth flotation processes. In one of its aspects the invention relates to the removal of iron impurity from glass making sand. In another of its aspects this invention relates to the use of alkanethiols as an iron collector in froth flotation of iron impurities. In another of its aspects the invention relates to the use of polyalkylene glycol frothing agents in combination with alkanethiol collecting agents. In ore flotation finely ground minerals are separated from their associated constituents, ores, gangue, or wastes. The flotation process is based on the fact that properly prepared mineral surface has an affinity for air bubbles. Froth flotation is a process in which a froth is formed by introducing air into a pulp of finely divided ore and water containing a frothing agent. Minerals that have a specific affinity for air bubbles rise to the surface with the foam or froth and are separated from those materials that are merely wetted by the water but do not rise to the surface in the froth. Froth flotation is a principal means for separating and concentrating copper, lead, zinc, phosphates, potash and a host of other ores. It is well known to add reagents in a froth flotation process to enhance separation. Those added to stabilize the air bubbles so that they will rise to the surface for subsequent removal in the forn of froth are called frothing agents and include such materials as pine oils, cresols, and alcohols. There are also reagents that can selectively cause mineral particles to become hydrophobic so that they can be brought to the surface with the air bubbles and separated with the froth. These reagents are called collectors and include among others such compounds as xanthates, amines, alkyl sulfates, arene sulfonates, dithiocarbamates, dithiophosphates, and thiols mercaptans . Alkanethiols are known as ore flotation agents or mineral collectors for many kinds of minerals, but their use in the flotation of iron compounds has not been particularly documented.Also it has been reported in Flotation by A. M. Gaudin,McGraw Hill Book Co., 1932 First Edition, that iron pyrite is floated better with xanthate collectors than with mercaptan collectors. It has now been recognized that alkanethiols can be particularly useful in the separation of iron impurities from glass making sands in a flotation process..Statement of the Invention According to this invention, a method is provided for removing iron impurities from glass making sand by froth flotation of the impurity containing sand employing alkanethiol as a collecting agent. The alkanethiols useful in this invention as iron collectors are represented by the formula C H SH wherein n can be any n 2n l integer from 5 to 17, preferably 9 to 17. Representative of this type materials are, but not limited to, for example n alkanethiols 1 pentanethiol, l hexanethiol, l nonanethiol, l decanethiol, 1undecanethiol, 1 dodecanethiol n dodecanethiol , l tetradecanethiol, l heptadecanethiol sec alkanethiols 2 nonanethiol, 2decanethiol, 2 undecanethiol, 2 dodecanethiol, 2 heptadecanethiol, 3 nonanethiol, 3 dodecanethiol, 3 heptadecanethiol and tertalkanethiols 2 methyl 2 octanethiol, 3 methyl 3 octanethiol, 4ethyl 4 heptanethiol, 2 methyl 2undecanethiol tert dodecanethiol , 3 methyl 3 undecanethiol tert dodecanethiol , 4 ethyl 4 decanethiol tert dodecanethiol , 5 ethyl 5 decanethiol tert dodecanethiol , 2,4,6 trimethyl 4 nonanethiol tert dodecanethiol , 3 n propyl 3tetradecanethiol, 2,4,6,8,10 pentamethyl 2 dodecanethiol and the like and mixtures thereof. The tertiary dodecanethiol used in the examples described herein was a mixture of tertiary dodecanethiols available fromPhillips Petroleum Co. under the tradename of Sulfol120. These materials are prepared by adding H2S to a propylene tetramer.This preparation is generally described in U.S. Patent 2,392,555, incorporated here by reference. The amount of alkanethiol employed will generally be tn 1 F from U.005 to 0.3 n bs per ton of sand used. The mercaptan may be employed either as a primary or as a secondary collector or both. The types of frothing agents useful in this invention are any materials known to those skilled in the art. Generally these will be alkylarylpolyether alcohols, sulfonates, polyalkylene glycols, polyalkylene glycol monoalkyl ethers, cresylic acid, pine oils, alcohols and the like. The amount of frothing agent to be used will generally be from 5 to 30 weight percent based on the O.11 to 41a mercaptan employed. This is equivalent toy 0.00025 to ores libs. of frothing agent per ton of sand employed. The types of sand treated by the method of this invention are any of those containing iron either as a major component or as a minor impurity. Iron can be as free iron, iron sulfide, iron oxide, iron silicate or any other similar combinations of iron, but is particularly effective in removing iron pyrite. Examples of typical forms of iron are, but not limited to, iron sulfide pyrite, marcasite, pyrrhotite iron silicate chamosite, silomelane, greenalite, minnesotaite, grunerite iron oxide magnetite, hematite, ilmenite, limonite iron carbonate sederite. Removal of iron in combination with other metals is also within the scope of this invention.Such materials are for example, but not limited to, chromate FeO Cr203 arsenopyrite FeAsS chalcopyrite CuFeS2 bornite Cu5FeS4 cubanite Cu2SFe4S5 valerite Cu2Fe4S7 or Cu3Fe4S7 daubrel i te FeSCr2S3 It is preferred that the sand be diluted with water to about 10 to 40 weight percent solids and that the particle size of the sand be such that it can pass through a U.S. Sieve screen size of at least 65 0.23 mm sieve opening . The following examples serve to illustrate the operabiliti of this invention. Example I This example is a control which describes the procedure used to remove iron impurities from glass making sand. A 1000 gram charge of silica sand having an iron content of 0.025 weight percent and a physical screen analysis as shown in Table I was placed in a Denver flotation cell, Model D 12. This provided about 20 weight percent solids when the cell volume was brought up to the proper level with tap water. To this mixture was added 1 milliliter of an aqueous solution containing 0.5 grams polypropylene glycol monomethyl ether Flotano PC 7, mol. weight 250 450 dissolved in 1000 grams of water. This is equivalent to 0.005 grams 0.01 lb. ton sand of Flotan p C 7 which is employed as a frothing agent. The agitator was turned on at 1200 rpm and the pulp was allowed to condition for one minute. The pH at this point was 8.Air was introduced into the sand through the agitator at1.20 m3 hour 42.5 cubic feet houA The froth was scraped off with a paddle at 50 strokes per minute for a period of five minutes. The remaining sand was removed from the cell, washed with copious amounts of water, oven dried at 82 C 180 F for about 24 hours and analyzed by Emission Spectroscopy using a Siemens x ray fluorescence spectrograph.The treated sand possessed an iron content of 0.0225.
