## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention is directed to a plasticized polyarylate composition comprising in admixture, a polyarylate derived from a dihydric phenol and at least one aromatic dicarboxylic acid and having a reduced viscosity of from about 0.4 to greater than 1.0 dl g, from about 5 to about 30 weight percent of glass fibers, and a plasticizing amount of an oligomeric poly aryl ether having a reduced viscosity of from about 0.10 to about 0.45 dl g. Polyarylstes are aromatic polyesters derived from a dihydric phenol, particularly 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane, also identified as bisphenol A, and an aromatic dicarboxylic acid, particularly mixtures of terephthalic and isophthalic acids. These polyarylates are high temperature, high performance thermoplastic polymers with a good combination of thermal and mechanical properties. However, polyarylates are generally processed at temperatures of about 6800C. Further, in many applications, it is desirable to add glass fiber to the the polyarylate. The addition of the glass fiber to polyarylate results in an increase in viscosity of the blend which makes processing even more difficult. Additives have been proposed which lower the processing temperature andlor viscosity of the polyarylate blend. However, many of these sdditives are not stable at such high temperatures.Thus, there is a desire to lower the processing temperature and or viscosity of the polyarylate blend without effecting the mechanical properties.Also, if an additive is used to lower the processing temperature it must be compatible with and not degrade the polyarylate. U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 233,697, filed on February 12, 1981, in the name of B.L.Dickinson, titled Plasticized PolyarylateCompositions, commonly assigned, describes a plasticized polyarylate composition comprising in admixture, a polyarylate derived from a dihydric phenol and at least one aromatic dicarboxylic acid having a reduced viscosity of from about 0.4 to greater than 1.0 dl g and a plasticizing amount of an oligomeric poly aryl ether having a reduced viscosity of from about 0.10 to about 0.45 dl g.This application discloses that glass may be an optional additive. However, such an incidental disclosure does not describe the problems associated with glass content of 5 to 30 weight percent or how to solve such problem. THE INVENTION It has now been discovered that by admixing a plasticizing amount of an oligomeric poly aryl ether having a reduced viscosity of from about 0.10 to about 0.45 dl g with a polyarylate derived from a dihydric phenol and at least one aromatic dicarboxylic acid having a reduced viscosity of from about 0.40 to greater than 1.0 dl g, and from about 5 to about 30 weight percent of glass fibers, the composition may be processed at lower temperature, thus retaining the high mechanical properties of the polyarylate. In the practice of this invetion, the oligomeric poly aryl ethers which may be used are linear, thermoplastic polyarylene polyether polysulfone oligomers wherein the arylene units are interspersed with ether and sulfone linkages. These resins may be obtained by reaction of an alkali metal double salt of a dihydric phenol and a dihalobenzenoid compound, either or both of which contain a sulfone or ketone linkage, i.e., 502 or CO between arylene groupings, to provide sulfone or ketone units in the polymer chain in sddition to arylene units and ether units.The polysulfone polymer has a basic structure comprising recurring units of the formula O E O E wherein E is the residuum of the dihydric phenol andE is the residuum of the benzenoid compound having an inert electron withdrawing group in at least one of the positions ortho and para to the valence bonds both of said residua are valently bonded to the ether oxygens through aromatic carbon atoms.Such polysulfones are included within the class of polyarylene polyether resins described in U.S.patents 3,264,536, 4,108,837, and 4,175,175 for example. The residuum of a dihydric phenol, E is derived from dinuclear phenols having the structure EMI3.1 wherein Ar is an aromatic group and preferably is a phenylene group, A and A1 may be the same or different inert substituent groups, such as alkyl groups having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, halogen atoms, i.e., fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine, or alkoxy radicals having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, r and rl are integers having a value of from 0 to 4, inclusive, and R is representative of a bond between aromatic carbon atoms as in dihydroxydiphenyl, or is a divalent radical, including, for example, CO, O, S, S S, S02 or a divalent organic hydrocarbon radical, such as alkylene, alkylidene, cycloalkylene, cycloalkylidene, or the halogen, alkyl, aryl substituted alkylene, alkylidene, cycloalkylene, and cycloalkylidene radicals as well as alkarylene and aromatic radicals and a ring fused to both Ar groups. Typical preferred oligomers have recurring units having the following structure EMI4.1 as described in U.S. Patent 4,108,837, supra. In the foregoing formula A and A1 can be the same or different inert substituent groups as alkyl groups having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, halogen atoms e.g., fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine or alkoxy radicals having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, r and rl are integers having a value of from 0 to 4, inclusive. Typicelly, R1 is representative of a bond between aromatic carbon atoms or a divalent connecting radical and R2 represents sulfone, carbonyl, or sulfoxide. Preferably, R1 represents a bond between aromatic carbon atoms.Even more preferred are the oligomeric polysulfones of the above formula wherein r and rl are zero, R1 is a divalent connection radical of the formulaEMI5.1 wherein R3 is independently selected from lower alkyl, aryl, and the halogen substituted groups thereof, preferably methyl and R2 is a sulfone group. The poly aryl ether oligomers have a reduced viscosity of from about 0.10 to about 0.45 dl g as measured in an appropriate solvent at an appropriate temperature depending on the particular polyether, such as in methylene chloride at 250C. The preferred poly aryl ether oligomers have repeating units of the formula EMI5.2 The polyarylates which are suitable for use in this invention are derived from 8 dihydric phenol and at least one aromatic dicarboxylic acid and have a reduced viscosity of from about 0.4 to greater than about 1.0, preferably from about 0.6 to about 0.8 dl gm, as measured in chloroform 0.5 g dl chloroform or other suitable solvent at 250C. A particularly desirable dihydric phenol is of the following formular EMI6.1 wherein Y is selected from alkyl groups of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, chlorine or bromine, each z, independently, has a value of from 0 to 4, inclusive, and R4 is a divalent saturated or unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon radical, particularly an alkylene or alkylidene radical having from 1 to 3 carbon atoms, or a cycloalkylidene or cycloalkylene radicals having up to and including 9 carbon atoms. The preferred dihydric phenol is bisphenol A. The dihydric phenols may be used individually or in combination. The aromatic dicarboxylic acids that may be used in this invention inclue terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, any of the naphthalene dicarboxylic acids and mixtures thereof, as well as alkyl substituted homologs of these carboylic acids, wherein the alkyl group contains from 1 to about 4 carbon atoms, and acids containing other inert substituents, such as halides, alkyl or aryl ethers, and the like. Preferably, mixtures of isophthalic .,and terephthalic acids are used. The isophthalic acid to t erephthalic acid ratio in the mixture is from about 20 80 to about 100 0, while the most preferred acid ratio is from about 75 25 to about 50 50.Also, from about 0.5 to about 20 percent of aliphatic diacids containing from 2 to about 10 carbon atoms, such as adipic acid, sebacic acid, and the like may be additionally used in the polymerization reaction.

These processes are described in, for example, U.S. Patents 3,317,464 3,948,856 3,780,148 3,824,213 and 3,133,898. Preferably, the polyarylates used in this invention are prepared by the process described inU.S. Patent 4,321,355. The process in said U.S.Patent prepares polyarylates having a reduced viscosity of from about 0.5 to greater than 1.0 dl g. said process comprises the following steps a reacting an acid anhydride derived from an acid containing from 2 to 8 carbon atoms with at least one dihydric phenol to form the corresponding diester and b reacting said diester with at least one aromatic dicarboxylic acid at a temperature sufficient to form the polyarylate, wherein the improvement comprises removing residual acid anhydride, after formation of the dihydric phenol diester, so that its concentration is less than about 1500 parts per million. The poly sryl ether oligomer is used in plasticizing amounts i.e. from about 5 to about 25, preferably from about 5 to about 15 weight percent, most preferably 10 weight percent. The glass which may be used herein may be in the form of fiber, etc. The glass is used in amounts of from about 5 to about 30, preferably from about 10 to about 20 weight percent.
