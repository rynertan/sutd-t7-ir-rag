# Composition for polyurethane resins and production of the resins.

## Abstract
Disclosed are a polyurethane composition of multi pack type, curable at ambient temperature, which com prises an isocyanate component having oxadiazinetrione ring, an active hydrogen component and a Lewis base having no hydrogen active to NCO group and a process for producing polyurethane from the composition. The composition has excellent curability at ambient temperature and is useful for coatings, adhesives and elastomers as high solid content type or solventless type. The cured product polyurethane has good mecha nical properties.
