# Drive unit mount for reciprocating floor conveyor.

## Abstract
A unitary framework for a reciprocating floor conveyor is positioned within a space between a pair of longitudinally extending main beams 110 , which may constitute portions of a preexisting support structure in a truck or trailer, for example. Telescopic tubular connector members 102 car ried by a plurality of outwardly projecting support arms 18 are telescopically moved outwardly to place their outher ends against inner surface portions of the beams 110 , and such outher ends of connector members 102 are welded to the beams 110 . The telescopic engagement between these members 102 and the outwardly projecting arms 18 hold the framework in position. The framework comprises a pair of longitudinally spaced apart, laterally extending king post trusses 10,12 , the apexes of which are directed downward ly. These trusses 10,12 are interconnected by means of a pair laterally spaced apart, longitudinally extending tie beams 14,16 . The tie beams 14,16 are connected to a pair of slide bearing assemblies 30,32 . These bearing assemb lies 30,32 include aligned guideways for receiving opposite end portions of longitudinal drive tubes 34,36,38 .
