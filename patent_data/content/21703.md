# Radiation curable dispersions containing high molecular weight nonpolymerizable vinyl resins.

## Abstract
There are disclosed dispersions of high molecular weight, essentially non polymerizable vinyl resins in mixtures of radiation curable monofunctional and polyfunctional acrylyl monomers and or oligomers. The dispersions are useful as coating and ink compositions.
