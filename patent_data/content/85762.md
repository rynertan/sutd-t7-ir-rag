# LOGIC PARITY CIRCUIT

## Abstract
An FET transmission logic parity circuit is disclosed which determines the odd or even status of register bits using zero DC current transmission logic. The circuit has a first two FET devices which propagate the state of the preceding odd or even nodes and the corresponding register bit is logically a zero. A second pair of FET devices switch the state of the odd or even nodes when the corresponding register bit is logically a one. In this manner, the output nodes are statically conditioned to either a first potential or a second potential, depending upon the register bit states and no DC current flows between the first and second potential.
