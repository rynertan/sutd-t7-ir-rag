# Electromagnetic relay.

## Abstract
An electromagnetic relay includes a base of electrically insulation for mounting an electromagnet, an armature and at least one contact assembly including a movable contact. In tegrally molded with the base is an envelop having side walls and a top wall for receiving therein the electromagnet which envelop defines on the base outwardly thereof a space for mounting the contact assembly. The side wall of the envelop extends along the entire length of the electromagnet in order to completely separate the contact assembly located out wardly ofthe envelop from the electromagnet along the entire length thereof for increased insulation resistance therebe tween. The armature is mounted on the top wall of the en velop to be movable within a horizontal plane on the top wall and is operatively connected to the movable contact of the contact assembly by a card extending over the side wall adja cent thereto. The electromagnet, contact assembly and arma ture are arranged in dense packed manner on the base while the electromagnet is effectively insulated by the envelop from the contact assembly, whereby assuring higher current car rying capacity with a miniaturized construction of the relay.
