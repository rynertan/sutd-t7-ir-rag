## Description
BENZIMIDAZOLES, BENZOXAZOLES, BENZOTHIAZOLES AND THEIRPRODUCTION, FORMULATION AND USE AS GASTRIC ACIDSECRETION INHIBITORS This invention relates to new compounds, methods for their preparation and pharmaceutical formulations containing them. A variety of benzothiazole 2 sulphinamides are known for use as vulcanisation accelerators, e.g. from USPatents Nos 2,585,155 and 3,541,060, from French PatentsNos 1,003,821 and 2,037,001, and from German OLS 1,949,615. A number of 2 pyridylmethylsulphinyl benzimidazoles are known for use as pharmaceuticals fromEuropean Patent Applications Nos 5129 and 80602 and fromBritish Patent Application No 2,134,523 and a number of 2 heterocyclicmethylsulphinyl benzimidazoles are known from Swiss Patent 623,582, West German OLS 2,548,340 andFrench Patent 2,392,021. According to the invention we provide compounds of formula I,EMI1.1 in which Rc is a nucleophilic nitrogen, oxygen or sulphur separated from the SO group by 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 other atoms, R1, R2, R3 and R4, which may be the same or different, are each hydrogen, halogen, alkoxy alkyl, fluoroalkyl, alkanoyl, RS O n , NO2, N R 2, NHCOR, or COOlI or an ester or amide thereof, or an adjacent pair of R1, R2, R3 and R4 may in addition to the values given above, together form a chain CH2 x or, together with the carbon atoms to which they are attached, form a 6 membered unsaturated.carbocylic or nitrogen heterocyclic ring, x is 3, 4 or 5, n is 0, 1 or 2, X is O, S or NR15, R15 is hydrogen, COR, COOR or alkyl which latter is optionally substituted by OCOR, R is hydrogen, phenyl, or alkyl optionally substituted by phenyl, the phenyl groups in turn optionally being substituted by alkyl, provided that i Rc is not CH2CH2 morpholino, ii that when Rc is a nitrogen nucleophile carried on an aryl or heteroaryl group R15 is not a group COR in which R is unsubstituted alkyl, iii when X is NR15 Rc does not comprise an unsaturated nitrogen heterocyclic ring other than such a ring substituted by either a a substituted or unsubstituted amino group, or b an N oxido group, and iv when X is NR15 Rc does not comprise an alkyl group substituted by an optionally alkyl or halo substituted piperidino group, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. We also provide the compounds of formula I without proviso ii and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, for use as pharmaceuticals, and without provisos i and ii for use in theprevention or. inhibition of gastric acid secretion. According to the invention we also provide a process for the production of a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, which comprises a selective oxidation of a corresponding compound of formula VI,EMI3.1 in which R11 R2, R3, R4, X and Rc are as defined above, b production of a compound of formula I in which X is NR15 and R15 is as defined above save that it cannot be hydrogen, by reaction of a corresponding compound of formula I in which R15 is hydrogen with a compoundR15Z in which R15 is as defined above save that it cannot be hydrogen, and Z is a good leaving group, or c production of a compound of formula I carrying an NH2 group by selective reduction of a corresponding compound of formula I carrying an NO2 group, and where desired or necessary converting the resulting compound of formula I to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or vice versa. The oxidation of process a may be carried out in a solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions, e.g.ethyl acetates dichloromethane, chloroform.or a. mixture thereof. The reaction is preferably carried out at less than room temperature, e.g. 200 to 100C. Suitable oxidising agents for use in the reaction are peracids, e.g. m chloroperbenzoic acid or t butylhydroperoxide in the presence of a suitable catalyst, e.g. vanadyl acetyl acetonate. In process b the good leaving group may be, for example, halogen and the reaction may be carried out in a solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions, e.g.dimethylformamide, in the presence of a base and at a temperature of from about 150 to 300C. In process c the selective reduction may, for example, be carried out chemically under basic conditions, e.g. using hydrazine and Raney nickel, but is preferably carried out catalytically, e.g. using a PtO2 catalyst and ethanol as the reaction medium. The compounds of formula VI may be made by conventional processes known per se, e.g. by reaction of compound of formula VII,EMI5.1 in which R1, R2, R3, R4 and X are as defined above, with a compound of formula VIII, Z Rc VIII in which Rc is as defined above, and z is a good leaving group, e.g. halogen chlorine . The reaction may be carried out in a suitable sdlvent, e.g. N,N dimethylformamide, and in the presence of an acid acceptor, e.g. potassium carbonate. The compounds of formulae VII and VIII are either known or may be made from known compounds using conventional techniques known per ge. The production of the starting materials for the above reactions is more fully described in British Patent Application No 85 09406 from which the present case draws priority. The compounds of formula I, and the intermediates therefor, may be isolated from their reaction mixtures using conventional techniques. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of formula I include salts with suitable organic or inorganic acids, e.g. with a hydrohalic, sulphuric, alkanesulphonic, tartaric or citric acid. We also provide, when the compound of formula I carries a COOB, or other acidic, group, salts with suitable organic or inorganic bases, e.g. ammonium, alkali metal, alkaline earth metal, alkylamino, etc. salts. The benzimidazole nucleus itself is acidic and can form salts with appropriate bases as above. The compounds of formula I, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, are useful because they possess pharmacological activity in animals in particular they are useful because they prevent or inhibit gastric acid secretion, e.g. in the test set out in Am.J.Physiol., 1982, 243 6 , G505 510. The compounds of formula I are also useful as intermediates in the synthesis of other chemicals. The new compounds are thus indicated for use in the prevention or inhibition of gastric acid secretion, and or the treatment of conditions normally involving excess gastric acid secretion, e.g. peptic, duodenal, gastric, recurrent or stormal ulceration, dyspepsia, duodenitis, Zollinger Ellison syndrome, reflux oesophagitis and the management of haemorrhage,.e.g. from erosion of ulcers in the upper gastrointestina1tract, especially when a major blood vessel is not involved.The compounds may also be used to treat gastritis or dyspepsia associated with .administration of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs, in the prophylaxis of gastrointestinal haemorrhage from stress ulceration in seriously ill or burned patientsr in the prophylaxis of recurrent haemorrhage in patients with bleeding peptic ulcers, before generai anaesthesia in patients at risk of acid aspiration syndrome Mendelson s syndrome and to reduce the chancre of haemorrhage in patients with leukaemia, graft versus host disease or with severe hepatic failure. The above conditions may be treated whether or not they are associated with excess gastric acid secretion. Patterns of therapeutic use which may be mentioned are a a high dose initially, for say 2 4 weeks, followed by lower dose maintenance therapy after the condition has improved, e.g. the ulcer has healed, b as in a above, but the maintenance therapy including a cytoprotective agent, e.g. a PGE2 derivative, c combination therapy, using a low dose of the compound of the invention in association with a low, well tolerated dose of a cytoprotectant and or antacid, d intermittent dosing, e.g. every second day, may be appropriate as maintenance therapy. For the above mentioned uses the dosage administered will, of course, vary with the compound employed, the mode of administration and the treatment desired. However, in general, satisfactory results are obtained when the compounds. are administered at a dosage of from 10 6M to 10 4M in the test set out in Am.J.Physiol, 1982, 243 6 ,G505 G5l0. For man the indicated total daily dosage is in the range of from about lmg to 3,000mg, preferably 5 to 500mg, and more preferably from about lOmg to 200mg, which may be administered in divided doses from 1 to 6 times a day or in sustained release form.Thus unit dosage forms suitable for administration comprise from about 1.0mg to 600mg of the compound admixed with a solid or liquid pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, carrier or adjuvant. The compounds of formula I, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, have the advantage that they are more readily absorbed, or are less irritant to the GI tract, or have less toxic side effects, or are more active, or are more stable to gastric acid when administered by ingestion than compounds of similar structure. The nucleophile which is part of the group Rc is preferably separated from the SO group by 4, or more preferably 3 or 2 atoms and those atoms are preferably carbon atoms. The nucleophile which is part of the groupRc is such as to be able to express its nucleophilicity under normal physiological conditions, e.g. at a pH of from about 7.4 to 1, and which in those conditions is more nucleophilic than water. The nucleophile is also preferably basic and the degree of protonation of the nucleophile will be related to the pH. However, there will always be a significant population of unprotonated nucleophile even at a low pH. Particular nucleophiles which may be mentioned include the oxygen of pyridine oxide or phenolic OH, the sulphur of a thioether or of a thiophenol or a precursor therefor, e.g. a thioester. However we prefer the nucleophile to be a nitrogen nucleophile in which the nitrogen atom carries no charge . We particularly prefer the nitrogen nucleophile to be in the form of an oxime, hydrazine, pyridine or most preferably amine group. The amine group may optionally be substituted, e.g. by groups Rg and R10 as defined below, and is preferably carried on an aromatic ring system, e.g. on a benzene ring. Groups Rc which may be mentioned include those of formula C R16R17 y CR18R19 z Rx in which Y and z, which may be the same or different, are each 0, 1 or 2 R16, R17, R18 and R19, which may be the same or different, are each hydrogen or alkyl, and Rx is a ring of formula II, III, IV or V,EMI10.1 EMI11.1 and, when y z is not 0, Rx may be NR9R10, R5, R6, R7 and R.8 are selected from the significances defined above for R1, R2, R3 andR4, Rg and R10, which may be the same or different, are each hydrogen, alkyl, phenyl or cycloalkyl each of which may optionally be substituted by phenyl, the phenyl groups in turn optionally being substituted by alkyl, or one of Rg and R10 may be as defined above and the other may be OR11 or NR12R13, or R9 and R101 together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached may form a saturated or unsaturated 4 to 8 inclusive membered ring which may contain 0, 1 or 2 further hetero atoms, which ring may carry one or more substituents R1, and R111 R12 and R13, which may be the same or different, each represent hydrogen, alkyl optionally substituted by halogen or by 0, cycloalkyl, alkanoyl, phenyl or pyridyl, or R9 is as defined above save that it cannot form a ring with R10, and R8 and R10, together with the nitrogen atom and the carbon atoms of the ring to which the nitrogen atom and R8 are attached, form a saturated 4 to 8 inclusive membered ring which may contain 0, 1, or 2 further hetero atoms, which ring may carry one or more substituents R1, A represents a 5 or 6 membered nitrogen or sulphur containing heterocyclic ring which is connected to the rest of the molecule through a ring carbon atom, Y is N or C, when Y is N, W is 0 and when Y is C then W is OH or SR14, and R14 is hydrogen, phenyl, cycloalkyl, alkanoyl or alkyl optionally substituted by phenyl. We prefer at least one of R1, R2, R3 and R4, and at least one of R5, R6, R7 and R8 to be other than hydrogen. When R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6,R7 or R8 is halogen it may be chlorine or fluorine. When any of R1 to R8, R, X, Rg, R10, Rill, R12 R13 R14, R15, R16, R17, R18 or R19 represent or contain a carbon containing group we prefer that group to contain up to and including 10 and preferably up to and including 6, carbon atoms. We particularly prefer each of R9 and R10 to contain 1 or 2 carbon atoms. When Rg and R10 together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached form a ring, the ring may contain a further nitrogen, oxygen and or sulphur atom.We prefer that ring to be a piperidino or morpholino ring. We prefer ring A to be aromatic. Examples of ring A which may be mentioned are thiophene, pyrazole and preferably pyrimidine or pyridine. The number of substituents R5 to R7 clearly cannot be more than the number of positions available for substitution on ring A. When any of R1 to R8 represent an ester we prefer it to be with a C1 to 6 alcohol, e.g. with an alkanol.When any of R1 to R8 represent an amide they may be, for example, an unsubstituted or a mono or di alkyl substituted amide. When an adjacent pair of R1 to R4 or R5 to R8 together form a chain we prefer that chain to be CH CH CH CH or CH2 4 . Specific groups R1 to R4 include hydrogen, methoxycarbonyl, phenylcarbonyl, methyl, chloro, methoxy,CF3, NO2, p toluenesulphonyl and NH2 or an adjacent pair of R1 to R4 may together form a CH CH CH CHchain. We prefer y to be 0 and z to be 0 or 1. We also prefer R16, R17, R18 and R19 to be selected from H and methyl, and more preferably for all to be H. Specific non cyclic groups Rc which may be mentioned are CH2CH2N CH3 2 and CH2CH2N CH3 C6H5. Specific groups R5 to R8 include hydrogen, methyl, chloro, propyl, methoxyl and butyl. When R8 and R10, together with the nitrogen atom and the carbon atoms of the ring to which they are attached, form a ring, we prefer that ring to be a piperidino ring, e.g. an N methyl pperidino ring. Specific groups X are NH, O, S, Nacetyl, NCH 2OCOt butyl, NCOOethyl and Methyl. A specific group R14 is acetyl. According to the invention we provide the following specific groups of compounds of formula I,EMI14.1 in which R R2a R5a and R6a, which may be the same or different, are each hydrogen, halogen, alkoxy, alkyl, or COOH or an ester thereof, EMI15.1 in which R1a, R2a, R5a and R6a, are as defined above, and R3b and R4b, which may be the same or different, are each hydrogen or alkyl,EMI15.2 in which R1a, R2a, R5a, R6a, R3b and R4b, are as defined above, and Xc is NH, Nalkyl C1 to 6, 0 or S,EMI15.3 in which Rld, R2d R3d and R4d, which may be the same or different, are each hydrogen, halogen, alkoxy, alkyl, fluoroalkyl, alkanoyl, RdS O n , or COOH or an ester thereof, or an adjacent pair of Rld, R2d, R3d and R4d may in addition to the values given above, together form a chain CH2 x1 CH CH CH CH or N CH CH CH , x, n and Xd are as defined above, m is 1 or 2, Rd is alkyl optionally substituted by phenyl which in turn is optionally substituted by alkyl, R5d and R6d, which may be the same or different, are each hydrogen or alkyl, or one of R5d and R6d may be as defined above and the other may be Rlld or NR12dR13d or R5d and R6d, together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, may form a saturated or unsaturated 4 to 8 inclusive membered ring which may contain 0, 1 or 2 further hetero atoms, which ring may carry one or more substituents Rld, and R11d, R12d and R13dZ which may be the same or different, each represent hydrogen, alkyl optionally substituted by halogen or 0, cycloalkyl, alkanoyl, phenyl or pyridyl, EMI17.1 in which R1e, R2e, R3e, R4e, R5e, R6e,R7e and R8e, which may be the same or different, are each hydrogen, halogen, alkoxy, alkyl, fluoroalkyl, alkanoyl, RdS O n , or COOH or an ester thereof, or an adjacent pair of Rle, R2e, R3e and R4e and or an adjacent pair of R5e, R6e, R7e and R8e may in addition to the values given above, together form a chain CH2 x , CH CH CH CH or N CH CH CH , x, n, Xd and Rd are as defined above, p is 0, 1 or 2, Y is N or C, when Y is N, W is O or NH , and when Y is C then W is OH or SR9e, and R9e is hydrogen, alkyl optionally substituted by phenyl, phenyl or cycloalkyl,EMI17.2 in which R1e, R2e, R3e, R4e, R5e, R6e,R7e, R8e, n, p and Xd are as defined above, R9f, is hydrogen, alkyl or cycloalkyl each of which may optionally be substituted by phenyl, the phenyl in turn optionally being substituted by alkyl, or R9f may be OR11 or NR12R13, R11, R12 and R13 are as defined above, and R8f and R10f, together with the nitrogen atom and the carbon atoms of the benzene ring to which the nitrogen atom and R8f are attached, form a saturated 4 to 8 inclusive membered ring which may contain 0, 1 or 2 further hetero atoms,EMI18.1 in which A represents a 5 or 6 membered nitrogen or sulphur containing heterocyclic ring, R1e, R2e, R3e, R4e, R5e, R6e, R7e, Xd and p are as defined above, R9g and R10g, which may be the same or different, are each hydrogen, alkyl or cycloalkyl each of which may optionally be substituted by phenyl, the phenyl in turn optionally being substituted by alkyl, or one of R 9g and R10g may be as defined above and the other may be OR11 or NR12R13, or R9g and Rlog, together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, may form a saturated 4 to 8 inclusive membered ring which may contain 0, 1 or 2 further hetero atoms, which ring may carry one or more substituents R1e, and Roll, R12 and R13 are as defined above,EMI19.1 in which R1, R2, R3, R4, X, p and Rx are as defined above save that when an adjacent pair of R1,R2, R3 and R4 and or an adjacent pair of R5, R6,R7 and R8 together form a chain that chain is CH2 x , CH CH CH CH or N CH CH CH . Certain of the compounds of formula VI are novel and the invention also provides these novel compounds. Of particular interest are compounds of formula VI in which y z is more than 0 and in particular such compounds in which Rx is a ring of formula III. According to our invention we also provide a pharmaceutical composition comprising preferably a minor proportion of a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, as active ingredient, in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant, diluent or carrier. Examples of suitable adjuvants, diluents or carriers are for tablets and dragees lactose, starch, talc or stearic acid for capsules, tartaric acid or lactose for suppositories, natural or hardened oils or wax and for injections i.m.or i.v. or enemas water, surfactants and preservatives.The compounds may also be administered transdermally, e.g. in an ointment base. The compound of formula I, or the pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, preferably has a mass median diameter of from 0.01 to 10 microns. The compound of such particle size may be made by grinding or milling followed if necessary by particle size classification using, for example, a sieve. The compositions may also contain suitable preserving, stabilising, and wetting agents, solubilizers, sweetening and colouring agents and flavourings. The compositions may, if desired, be formulated in sustained release form. The compounds may, if desired, be co administered, with e.g. as a mixture with an antacid buffer. We prefer compositions which are designed to be taken by ingestion or rectally and to release their contents in the intestine. We particularly prefer compositions which will pass through the acidic parts of the gastrointestinal tract unaffected, e.gX enteric coated formulations. The compounds of formula I are optically active and may be resolved into their optical isomers using conventional techniques known per se. The invention therefore provides the compounds as their optical isomers, or as mixtures, e.g. racemic mixtures, thereof. The invention is illustrated, but in no way limited by the following Examples in which temperatures are in degrees centigrade.Example 1N,N Dimethyl 2 lH benzimidazol 2 ylsulphinylmethyl benzenamine may N,N Dimethyl 2 lH benimidazo1 2ylthiomethyl benzenamine 2 Dimethylaminobenzyl chloride hydrochloride 8.18g was dissolved in dry dimethylformamide l00ml , treated with 2 mercaptobenzimidazole 5.4g and anhydrous potassium carbonate gll.Og and the resulting mixture stirred.at room temperature overnight.
