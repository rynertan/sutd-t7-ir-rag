# Solutions of resins in a monomer, containing polyamine reactable with isocyanates, moulding compositions and cured product thereof.

## Abstract
Ethylenically unsaturated monomer solutions of ethylenically unsaturated polyester, polyester urethane and polyisocyanurate resins are quickly converted to moldable gels by the homogeneous formation therein of polyurea resins by the interaction of polyamines and polyisocyanates. Tack free handleable moldable gels are formed within minutes which can be stored under normal conditions for long periods of time until molded. Fully cured intractable articles are formed by the polymerization of the ethylenically unsaturated ingredients.
