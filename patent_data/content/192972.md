# Highly abrasive resistant material.

## Abstract
An alloy characterized by its highly abrasive resistant qualities which render it particularly suitable for use as the material from which to fabricate the external surface of a grinding, i.e., pulverizer, roll 18 of the type that is designed to be employed in a bowl mill 10 so as to be operative therein for purposes of effecting the pulverization of a material such as coal through the coaction of the grinding roll 18 with another surface 14 with which the bowl mill 10 is provided for this purpose. The subject alloy which is capable of being cast or applied to the grinding roll 18 in the form of a weld overlay comprises, by weight percentages, 4.0 6.0 Carbon 3.0 14.0 Manganese 1.0 2.5 Silcon 15.0 30.0 Chromium and 4.0 6.0 Molybdenum with 0.5 2.0 Boron being added thereto, the balance being iron and icidental impurities.
