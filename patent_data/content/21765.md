## Abstract
A rotary fluid machine 10 comprising at least two toroidal chambers 11A, 11B arranged to interpenetrate, each of said chambers containing ports 16₁, 16₂, 16₃, 16₄ and a rotary piston means 12A that drives an output shaft 13 , the piston means of each chamber being so correlated in their respective movements that they provide working sections in the chambers for the fluid to effect a power drive into said output shaft 13 .
