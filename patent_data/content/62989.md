# Latex foam rubbers.

## Abstract
A latex foam rubber which is non self propagating when subjected to the cigarette test B.S.S. 5852, Part I, 1979 is produced from a formulation containing from 10 to 25 parts by weight natural rubber, from 75 to 100 parts by weight S B rubber, accelerators, fillers and elemental sulphur. The level of elemental sulphur is 1 part by weight or less per hundred parts rubber. Restriction of the sulphur level, especially in foam rubbers containing relatively large amounts of S B rubber, leads to a product which passes the said B.S.S. test, where a mere conventional amount of sulphur e.g. 2 2.5 parts would lead to failure. Any slight deterioration in the physical properties of the product can be redressed by including up to 25 phr e.g. 10 15 phr of polystyrene or a high styrene S B resin latex in the formulation.

## Description
LATEX FOAM RUBBERS This invention relates to latex foam rubbers and in particular to latex foam rubbers which will pass the cigarette test defined in British Standard SpecificationNo. 5852 Part I 1979. Latex.foam rubbers are widely used in the manufacture of better quality upholstery articles, especially furniture cushions, generally in combination with one or more layers of a covering material. while covering materials which are resistant to smouldering are known, it is desirable that the underlying foam rubber material should also be non smouldering, particularly as various countries have already introduced or propose to introduce legislation requiring that all such upholstery articles shall pass the said cigarette test. Foam rubbers derived mainly or wholly from latices of natural rubber are satisfactorily resistant to smouldering, but these materials tend to be relatively expensive. The less expensive synthetic latex foam rubbers, which are more readily available both in terms of price and supply , are not themselves resistant to smouldering and tend to form a self propagating char on subjection to the cigarette test. It has been proposed see U.K. Patent SpecificationNo. 970,493 to incorporate relatively high amounts of waxes or oils into a latex formulation in order to overcome this problem. However, such additives tend to migrate out of the foam rubber causing staining of the cover and may moreover be allergenic. It is common practice to use sulphur in an amount of 2 2 parts per hundred parts total rubber as a curative for latices. However, when such amounts are used in foam rubber containing high proportions of styrene butadiene polymer the resultant foam rubber fails .the cigarette test. We have, surprisingly, found that the level of sulphur may be substantially reduced in the latex formulation, resulting in foam rubbers which, under the conditions of the said cigarette test, are non self propagating. Although it would be expected that this reduction in sulphur content would bring about a marked deterioration in the physical properties of the foam rubbers, we have found that the effect of lowering the sulphur content on the properties is comparatively slight. Latex foam rubbers produced in accordance with the present invention have been found to exhibit adequate physical properties especially compression modulus .Moreover, any slight deterioration in physical properties can readily be redressed by the addition of small amounts of a resin e.g. polystyrene or a reinforcing latex e.g. high styrene styrene butadiene resin latex . Accordingly, the present invention provides a latex foam rubber derived from a formulation comprising from0 to 25 parts by weight of natural rubber, from 75 to 100 parts by weight of styrene butadiene rubber, one or more accelerators, one or more fillers and elemental sulphur, in which the maximum proportion of elemental sulphur in the formulation is 1 part by weight per 100 parts total rubber, the said latex foam rubber being non self propagating when subjected to the cigarette test defined in BritishStandard Specification No. 5852 Part I, 1979. The proportions by weight of natural rubber to styrene butadiene rubber in the formulation can be, for example, 20 80 or 10 90. The accelerator can be, for example, zinc diethyldithiocarbamate ZEDC , zinc mercaptobenzthiazole CZMBT suitably a. mixture of ZEDC and ZMBT in equal proportions by wetght , or other accelerators conventionally used for latex foam rubbers and well known to those skilled in the art. Preferred fillers include the hydrated aluminas and the aluminium silicates. The elemental sulphur may be incorporated in the latex formulation as sulphur per se in a form which is soluble in the foam matrix . Alternatively, sulphur donor compounds such as dimorpholinodisulphide available from Monsanto as SULFASAN R or di pen tame thylene thiuram tetrasulphide available from Robinson Bros. as ROBAC P25 may be used. The words SULFASAN and ROBAC are Registered Trade Marks . If necessary, up to 25 parts preferably 10 to 15 parts per 100 parts total rubber of polystyrene or a high styrene styrene butadiene resin latex may be added to the formulation to compensate for any slight deterioration of the physical properties of the foam rubber caused by the reduction in the level of elemental sulphur in the formulation If small amounts of an oil were to be used in the foam rubber formulation, the level of sulphur could be marginally increased. The present invention will be illustrated, merely by way of example, as follows CONTROL EXAMPLE A latex mix was compounded to the formulation shown in TABLE A below , ingredients being added in the order listed. TABLE ANote Amount parts by v.i.

The words WINGSTAY and BACO are Registered Trade Marks . After the mix had been matured overnight at ambient temperature, a 200 g portion was placed in the bowl of a gitchenAid Model 4C laboratory mixer. Ammonia 0.2 php, 35 aqueous solution was added and the mix frothed at mixer speed 8 for 90 seconds. Zinc oxide 3.0 php, 50 dispersion in water was incorporated at speed 4, followed 30 seconds later by diphenylguanidine 0.5 php, 40 dispersion in water . After a further 30 seconds sodium silicofluoride 5.0 php, 50 dispersion in water was added and stirring continued for one minute before refining at speed 2 for a further minute. The foam was then poured into a suitable mould and the mould lid closed.After gelation, the moulded foam rubber was kept at ambient temperature for 7 minutes before being placed in a steam oven for 30 minutes to effect vulcanisation. The latex foam rubber was demoulded, washed and dried pos tcured for 3 hours at 105 C in a circulating air oven. The foam rubber was covered with a material comprising 48 acrylic fibres, 35 cotton fibres and 17 viscose fibres and having a weight of 0.387 Kg mZ. Available from NBS Co Limited as DR4LON Registered Trade Mark under design No S175. After 9 minutes exposure to a lighted cigarette, self propagating charring of the covered foam rubber was observed with considerable smoke evolution. Extensive damage was observed after about 20 minutes. The foam rubber continued to smoke vigorously after the cigarette was consumed and clearly it failed the test.EXAMPLE 1 The formulation shown in TABLE B below was made up as described with reference to the CONTROL EXAMPLE.

In contrast to the foam rubber of the CONTROL EXAMPLE, the foam rubber of EXAMPLE 1 did not exhibit vigorous smoke evolution and indeed smoking ceased completely after 21 minutes the cigarette was consumed after 18 minutes .Charring was restricted closely to the area of contact with the cigarette.EXAMPLE 2 This was similar to EXAMPLE 1 except that 10 php of polystyrene Ciago Latex H9 was incorporated into the basic mix to improve compression hardness characteristics of the resultant foam rubber.
