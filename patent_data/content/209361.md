# Material applicator.

## Abstract
An applicator, for example for applying cosmetics materials from a container, has a handle portion at one end and a material retaining portion at the other, and includes first and second interconnected parts which are relatively moveable in an axial direction for altering the overall length of the applicator. In the embodiments the applicator is longest when withdrawn from the container, and shortest when attached to the container with the material retaining portion disposed therein. Accordingly, the container does not have to accommodate the full length of the withdrawn applicator and can therefore be reduced in length.

## Description
MATERIAL APPLICATOR This invention relates to a material applicator, and particularly, but not exclusively, to an applicator for liquid, semi liquid, viscous or paste like cosmetics materials, e.g. mascara. The invention also relates to an assembly of an applicator and a container for material to be applied by the applicator. In a known form of cosmetics package, a container for a liquid, semi liquid, viscous or paste like material comprises a generally cylindrical glass or plastics bottle, and an applicator for the cosmetics material to be retained in the container comprises a tubular cap adapted to screw fit or snap fit into the neck of the container, the cap also serving as a handle from which a rod extends acially so as to project through the neck into the container when the container and cap are assembled. At the end of the rod there is a material retaining element which can retain thereon a quantity of the material, this portion being suitably formed for material application.For example, this portion may comprise a bristle brush having a twisted wire stem and bristles projecting radially tere ro, or it may comprise rows of flexible teeth integrally mounted from plastics material with the rod of the applicator, or it may comprise annular grooves and ridges formed at the end of the rod. Numerous other forms of material applicator known to persons skilled in the art may also be used. It will be appreciated that the rod has to project from the cap by a substantial amount so as to permit the application of the material where required, e.g., when the material is a mascara composition, to the eyelashes. Accordingly, it has been necessary to use a correspondingly long container so as to accommodate the full length of the rod and brush when the applicator is assembled to the container. This places severe restrictions upon the design of certain forms of cosmetics package, e.g. mascara packages. It would be desirable, for example, to be able to reduce the overall length of the package, but given that the cap must be of a certain length so as to provide a large enough handle, and that the container itself must be long enough to accommodate the rod and brush, this reduction in size is difficult to achieve. The present invention provides an applicator which alleviates this problem. According to the invention, there is provided an elongate material applicator comprising a handle portion at one end and a material retaining portion at the other, the applicator having first and second interconnected parts which are relatively movable in axial direction for altering the overall length of the applicator. Accordingly, where the applicator is to be assembled to a container for the material to be applied by the applicator, the arrangement may be such that the applicator is shortest when it is assembled to the container, and is extendable on withdrawal from the container. In one arrangement, the applicator comprises a tube projecting from the handle, and the material retaining portion, is fixed to a rod which can slide within the tube between a position in which such portion projects from the end of the tube, and a position in which it is fully retracted within the tube. In another arrangement disclosed herein, a rod or stem carrying the brush is partially retractable within an elongate cap which is attachable to the neck of the bottle and which acts as the handle for the applicator. According to the invention there is al so provided an assembly of a material applicator and a container for containing material to be applied by the applicator, the applicator comprising a handle, a stem extending from the handle, and material retaining means provided at the outer end of the stem, the container having an opening through which said material retaining means is insertable, and the applicator and container being attachable one to the other, wherein the applicator is extendable from a relatively shortened condition when attached to the container to a relatively lengthened condition when detached from the container. Preferred embodiments of the invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is an axial cross sectional view of an applicator according to a first embodiment of the invention as assembled to a container for containing a quantity of cosmetics material to be applied by the applicator Figure 2 illustrates the applicator of Figure 1 in its condition after removal from the container Figure 3 is a longitudinal cross section through an assembly of an applicator according to a second embodiment of the invention, shown as assembled to a container for containing a cosmetics material to be applied by the applicator Figure 4 shows the applicator of Figure 3 in its condition after removal from the container Figure 5 is a longitudinal sectional vie of an assembly comprising a material applicator according to a third embodiment of the invention as assembled to a container for containing a cosmetics material to be applied by the applicator and Figure 6 shows the applicator of Figure 5 in its condition after withdrawal and detachment from the container. With reference first to Figures 1 and 2, there is shown an assembly of an applicator 1, and a container 2 for a liquid, semi liquid, viscous or paste like cosmetics material 3 to be applied by the applicator. The container 2 has an externally screw threaded neck 4 which accommodates a wiper element 5, and the applicator 1 comprises a cap 6 which is closed at one end and internally screw threaded at its other end 7 for attachment to the neck 4 of the container. A tube 8 fixed to the cap projects axially from the open end 7 in such a way that when the cap is screwed on to the neck of the container, this tube 8 projects through the wiper 5 into the container. A rod member 9 is slidably accommodated within the tube 8, and a compression spring 10, also disposed within the tube 8, urges the rod 9 towards the lower end of the tube 8. An elongate material retaining member 11 project axially from the other end of the rod 9. In the present embodiment, this material retaining member 11 comprises a brush having a central stem 12 and bristles 13 extending radially therefrom.The arrangement is such as to permit the rod 9 to slide within the tube 8 between an outer position as shown in Figure 2 in which the brush 11 projects axially from the end of the tube 8, and an inner position as shown in Figure 1, in which the brush 11 is fully retracted within the tube 8, the spring 10 biasing the rod 9 toward the outer position. Also, the arrangement is such as to retain the rod 9 within the tube and prevent any further outward movement at the exposed position of the brush. It will be readily understood that as the extended applicator is assembled to the container, the brush 11 and then the lower part of the tube 8 pass through the wiper element 5, and the lower end of the brush 11 comes into abutment with the inner surface of the base of the container 2. From this point, as the cap 6 is pushed further toward the container, the tube 8 is pushed downwardly, and the brush 11 begins to enter the tube against the bias of the spring 10 which compresses as the rod 9 moves axially in the tube in a direction toward the cap 6. The relative dimensions are such that when the cap has been fully screwed onto the neck of the container, the lower end of the tube 8 lies adjacent or very close to the base of the container, and the brush is substantially fully retracted within the tube 8, the spring 10 being then in its state of maximum compression. Thus, in the normal storage position of the assembly as shown in Figure 1, the applicator is in its shortened condition, and the brush 11 is shielded by the tube 8 from contact with the material 3. When it is desired to use the applicator for applying the material 3, the cap 6 is unscrewed from the neck of the container. As this is done, the cap moves axially relative to the container, and the spring 10 is allowed to expand so as to keep the brush in its lowermost position with its lower end abutting the base of the container. Eventually, the expansion of the spring 10 will cause the applicator to extend to itsmaximum length, at which time the brush 11 will be immersed in the material 3. Further withdrawal of the applicator relative to the container will cause the lower end of the tube 8, and then the brush 11 itself to be withdrawn through the wiper 5, which serves to clean the outer surface of the tube 8 and to remove excess material from the bristles of the brush 11. It will therefore be seen that according to this embodiment, there is provided a material applicator which is extendable from a relatively shortened condition as illustrated in Figure 1 to a relatively extended condition as shown in Figure 2. Accordingly, given that a projection of a magnitude L2 see Figure 2 is required for the applicator to be capable of being used properly for its intended purpose e.g. the application of the mascara to the eyelashes , then whereas with a fixed length applicator a container of length L2 ignoring the container neck would be required, the applicator construction according to this embodiment where the effective length of the applicator can be reduced, permits a shorter container.of length L1 to be used see Figure 1 . Furthermore, the cap 6 may be made longer than in a conventional fixed length applicator, to cover a greater length of the container than usual whilst still ensuring that the applicator will project from the cap, when removed from the container, by the conventional amount. It is envisaged that a mechanism could be incorporated in the applicator so as optionally to delay the extension of the applicator until it is out of the cosmetic material. In this way, the brush 11 would not be immersed in the cosmetic material before withdrawal and would therefore be clean when removed from the container. With reference now to Figures 3 and 4, which shows schematically a second embodiment of the invention, a cosmetics package comprises an applicator 13 and a container 14 for containing quantity of material 15 to be applied by the applicator. Again, the package may be a cosmetics e.g. mascara package where the material 15 will be a liquid, semi lqiuid, viscous or paste like cosmetics material. The applicator comprises a tubular cap 16 which is internally threaded at its forward end 17 so as to screw onto the externally screw threaded neck 18 of the container.Again, this cap 16 serves as a handle for the applicator. A material retaining and application element 19 in the form of a bristle brush is carried at the end of an elongate stem 20, the other end of which is attached to or integrally formed with a stem head 21 which is slidably accommodated within the cap 13. The stem 20 projects through a central aperture of an annular stop 22 projecting inwardly from the inner surface of the cap, and this stop limits the outward movement of the stem and brush relative to the cap. A cap closure plug 23 closes of the end of the cap and provides a stop for the inward movement of the stem and brush relative to the cap. In Figure 3, the applicator is shown in its condition when screwed onto the neck of the container.The stem head is at its innermost position relative to the cap and a substantial portion of the stem 20 is accommodated within the cap, so that the overall length of the applicator is at its minimum. When the applicator is to be removed from the container, the cap is unscrewed and is thereafter pulled away from the container. The arrangement is such that the frictional forces resisting movement of the stem and brush through a wiper insert 24 located in the neck of the container exceed the frictional forces resisting movement of the stem head 21 within the cap and the stem 20 through the aperture in the stop 22. Accordingly, as the cap is initially pulled away from the container, the stem and brush remain substantially stationary relative to the container and the stem head moves axially within the cap toward the stop 22.Further outward pulling of the cap after the stem head has come into abutment with the stop 22 will cause the brush to be pulled through the wiper 24 out of the container. The brush will then be in condition shown in Figure 4, that is to say at its maximum length, in which it can be used for the application of the material retained on the bristles of the brush 19. On reinsertion of the brush, the frictional forces between the brush and the wiper 24 resisting such reinsertion will exceed the frictional forces resisting movement of the stem head within the cap and accordingly the stem head 21 will slide towards the cap closure 23 as the cap is pushed toward the container while the brush is located in the wiper 24. After the stem head 21 abuts the cap closure 23, further pushing of the cap will cause the brush to be pushed through the wiper into the container, and the cap can then be screwed onto the neck of the container to close the assembly. If the friction between the brush and the wiper on reinsertion is substantially less than on withdrawal, and the brush passes through the wiper whilst the applicator is still in its fully extended condition, the end 25 of the brush will come into abutment with the base of the container, and further pushing of the cap toward the container will then cause the stem to telescope into the cap. As in the first embodiment, the applicator ofFigures 3 and 4 is of variable length so as to enable a relatively short container to be used, while still ensuring that there is sufficient projection of the applicator from the cap handle to permit proper use of the applicator after withdrawal from the container. Figures 5 and 6 illustrate a modified form of the previous embodiment. In this modification, the cap 13 has in the region of its open end an insert element 26 which is a friction fit within the tubular outer shell 27 of the cap. The forward portion 26 of this insert is internally screw threaded for engagement on the neck of the container 14, and a radially inwardly projecting annular flange 28 serves both to close off the mouth of the container when the cap is screwed onto the container neck, and also provides a stop to limit the forward movement of the stem head 21. In this embodiment, the brush 19 comprises a twisted wire stem 29 in which helical flightings of radially projecting bristles 30 are rooted. An end of this stem 29 is fixed in an aperture 20 formed in the outer end of the stem 20. The operation of the Figure 5 6 embodiment is similar to that of the Figure 3 4 embodiment, the stem head 21 sliding forwardly within the cap toward the insert 26 on withdrawal of the applicator from the container, and rearwardly toward the closed end of the cap on reinsertion. Again, therefore, the elongate applicator of Figures 5 and 6 is of variable length to permit use of a relatively short container 14 whilst ensuring that on withdrawal the applicator is of sufficient length for proper use. In both of the embodiments of Figures 3 4 andFigures 5 6 the wiper stem can be provided with surface irregularities so as to improve the friction fit with the wiper, thereby further to ensure that the applicator will be extended on removal from the container before the brush passes through the wiper. Further, a locking stop may be provided inside the cap so as to hinder retraction of the extended applicator whilst in use. In all of the above described embodiments, a mechanism may be incorporated to provide for variation of the degree of extension of the applicator on removal from the container. Such mechanism may allow preselection of the extended applicator length, for example by movement of an adjustable stop for limiting the outward movement of the stem head 21 in the embodiments of Figures 3 to 6. Furthermore, the two arrangements of Figures 3 to 6 may be modified by the addition of spring means for assisting the extension of the applicator on removal from the container. For example, a compression spring 31 may be disposed in the cap 16 between the closed end of the cap and the stem head 21 biasing the stem outwardly to the extended condition of the applicator, as shown in figure 4 in dashed lines
