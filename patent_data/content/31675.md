## Description
This invention relates to an improved method of catalytically converting olefins into gasoline fractions. More particularly, this invention involves the conversion of olefinlc containing mixtures into gasoline range product. It has long been known to contact various hydrocarbon fractions with acidic catalysts generally and, in particular, with solid siliceous acidic catalysts including those referred to as crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites. Contact of said hydrocarbon feed with said acid catalysts was carried out for a wide variety of reactions including cracking, isomerization, hydrocracking, etc. Representative U.S. specifications disclosing and claiming contacting of various hydrocarbon fractions with crystalline alumincsilicates are Nos. 3,143,249, 3,140,251, 3,140,253, and 3,140,322. The contact of paraffinic feedatocks with crystalline aluminosiiicate zeolites is also known in the at and by far the primary reason for contacting paraffinic materials with zeolites has been for the purpose of cracking them, i.e converting then to lower molecular weight products. Typical applications in this general field would be the use of crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites for carrying out dewaxing reactions, i.e. the cracking of paraffins to low molecular weight materials. U.S. Patent No. 3,400,072 discloses a dewaxng process with crystalline aluminosilicates generally and U.S. Patent No.3,700,585, discloses and claims dewaxing operations carried out with crystalline alumlnosilicates of theZSM 5 type. U.S. Patent 3,960,978 describes a process for making olefinic gasoline blending stock from C2 C5 olefin mixtures utilizing ZSM 5 type crystalline aluminosilicates. Recently, because of the greater awareness of the problem of environmental control, as well as air pollution, greater impetus has been given to investigations directed towards increasing the octane number of gasoline without the use of lead. In order to reduce automobile exhaust emissions to meet federal and state pollution requirements, many automobile manufacturers have now equipped the exhaust systems of their vehicles with catalytic converters.Said converters contain catalysts which are poisoned by lead. Since lead has been widely used in the past to boost the octane number of gasoline, refiners now have to turn to alternate means to improve gasoline octane number. The patent invention is concerned primarily with the preparation of higher molecular weight olefins from the stated feed and represents a significant improvement over prior art olefin conversion processes to gasoline range products in that octane number can be substantially increased. In accordance with the invention, there is provided an improved process for producing a gasoline fraction containing predominantely olefinic compounds and preferably having a research octane number of 90 or above and having therein no more than about 20 by weight of aromatics, said process comprising contacting a C2 C5 olefin containing mixture with a catalyst comprising a highly siliceous zeolite having a constraint index1 as hereinafter defined, in the approximate range of 1 to 12 and a silica to alumina mole ratio of at least 200. The significance and manner of determination of constraint index are described in our C. B. Specification 1,446,522. The improvement involved in the present invention is to employ such highly siliceous zeolites in lieu of conventional zeolites, e.g. silica to alumina mole ratio of about 70 to 1. In comparison to the use of conventional ZSM 5 zeolites, the highly siliceous zeolites of the instant invention provide a substantial increase in octane number of the liquid product. The process of the instant invention can yield a gasoline fraction with a research octane number with no added lead R 0 of at least 92. The present invention is concerned with contacting a feed stream consisting essentially ofC2 C5 olefins, with a catalyst comprising highly siliceous zeolites to obtain predominantly higher molecular weight olefins which have good octane numbers and which are excellent gasoline blending stocks. Said highly siliceous zeolites are characterized by a constraint index in the approximate range of 1 to 12 and a silica to alumina mole ratio of at least 200.Alternatively the product from the instant invention can be used as source of olefins for other chemical purposes such as conversion to alcohols, and the like. The feedstock useful in the instant invention may be, in addition to a pure C2 C5 clefin mixture, mixtures with other hydrocarbons, water, inerts, e.g. nitrogen, and any of a number of feeds from other sources. These other sources include total gas streams from, for example, an FCC, TCC or Riser Cracking unit, aC3 dry gas fraction, a C4 mixture from an unsaturated gas plant, a gas stream from a coking unit and a gas stream from a pyrolysis unit, just to mention a few. The silica to alumina mole ratio referred to may be determined by conventional analysis. This ratio is meant to represent, as closely as possible, the ratio in the rigid anionic framework of the crystal and to exclude aluminum in the binder or in cationic or other form within the channels. In highly siliceous zeolites, the upper limit of silica to alumina mole ratio is unbounded. ZSM 5, is one such example wherein the silica to alumina mole ratio is at least 5, but can be 100, 1,000, 10,000, or even greater, i.e. up to and including infinity. The highly siliceous zeolites of this invention are characterized by a silica to alumina mole ratio of at least 200 and it is preferred that the silica to alumina mole ratio be higher, e.g. silica to alumina mole ratios of 500 to 1, 1,000 to 1, 1,400 to 1, 1,600 to 1 and greater. The preferred zeolites, after activation, acquire an intracrystalline sorption capacity for normal hexane which is greater than that for water, i.e. they exhibit hydrophobic properties. It is believed that this hydrophobIc character is advantageous in many instances. Constraint Index CI values for some typical substances are Constraint Index ZSM 4 0.5 ZSM 5 8.3 ZSM ll 8.7 ZSM 12 2 ZSM 23 9.1 ZSM 35 4.5 ZSM 38 2 ZSM 48 3.4 TMA Offretite 3.7 Beta 0.6 H Zeolon mordenite 0.4 REY 0.4 Amorphous Silica Alumina 0.6 Erionite 38 Clinoptilolite 3.4 There may be situations where the activity is so low, i.e., silica to alumina mole ratio approaching infinity, that the Constraint Index cannot be adequately measured, i7 at all. In such situations, ConstraintIndex is to mean the Constraint Index of the same zeolite same crystal structure as determined by X ray diffraction pattern in an alumina containing form. The class of highly siliceous zeolites defined herein is exemplified by ZSM 5, ZSM ll, ZSM 12, ZSM 43 and other similar materials.

From these, the relative intensities, 1001 I0, where 10 is the intensity of the strongest line or peak, and d obs. , the interplanar spacing in A, corresponding to the recorded lines, were calculated.The intensity in Table 1 is expressed as follows m medium, w weak and vs very strong. ZSM ll is similar to ZSM 5 with the notable exception that whereas ZSM 5 contains a doublet at about 10.1, 3.73, 3.00 and 2.01 A interplaner spacing, ZSM ll shows a singlet at these values. This means that the crystal class of ZSM ll is different from that of the other zeolites. ZSM ll is tetragonal whereas ZSM 5 tends to be orthorhombic. The sodium form as well as other cationic forms reveal substantially the same pattern with minor shifts in interplanar spacing and variation of relative intensity. Other minor variations can occur depending on the silicon to aluminum mole ratio of the particular sample as well as on its degree of thermal treatment. Highly siliceous ZSM 12 is more particularly described in U.S. Patent Applications, Serial Nos. 003,146 and 003,144. In U.S. Application Ser. No. 003,16, filedJanuary 15. 1979, a highly siliceous ZSM 12 composition in its calcined form can be identified, in terms of moles of oxides per 100 moles of silica as follows O lO M2 nQ 0 0.5 A1 100 SiO2 wherein M is at least one cation having a valence n, and is further characterized by the X ray diffraction pattern of ZSM 12, as shown in Table 2 herein.

From these, the relative intensities, 100 I Io, where 10 is the intensity of the strongest line or peak, and d obs. , the interplanar spacing in A, corresponding to the recorded lines, were estimated. In Table 2, the relative intensities are given in terms of the symbols m medium, w weak and vs very strong. It should be understood that this X ray diffraction pattern is characteristic of all the species of ZSM 12 compositions.The sodium form as well as other cationic forms reveal substantially the same pattern wlth some minor shifts in interplanar spacing and variation in relative intensity. Other minor variations can occur depending on the silicon to aluminum mole ratio of the particular sample, as well as its degree of thermal treatment. Crystallization of the aforementioned substances described in U.S. Application Ser. Nos. 003,143 003,145 003,146 and 003,144 can be generally carried out at either static or stirred conditions.Static conditions can be achieved using polypropylene jars at about 100to or teflon lined stainless steel autoclaves at about 1600 C. Static conditions can also be carried out under pressure in a static bomb reactor.The total useful range of temperatures is about 800C to about 1800C for about 6 hours to 150 days. Thereafter, the zeolites are separated from the liquid and recovered. The composition can be prepared utilizing materials which supply the apprcpriate oxides.Depending on the particular zeolite formulation desired, reaction mixtures can include sodium, silicate, silica hydrosol, silica gel, silicic acid, sodium hydroxide, chromic potassium sulfate, or ferric ammonium sulfate.The organic compounds can include any element of Group VS such as nitrogen, phosphorous, arsenic, antimony, or bismuth, preferably nitrogen or phosphorous. However, in the case of Application Ser. No. 003,146, the organic compound include the tetraethyl derivatives of Group VB elements. The preferred compounds are quaternary compounds generally expressed by the following formula EMI15.1 wherein L is an element of Group B of thePeriodic Chart, preferably nitrogen, and each R is an alkyl or aryl group having between 1 and 7 preferably between 2 and 5 carbon atoms. It may be preferable in some formulations that at least one R group be an ethyl group or a butyl group. Normally each alkyl or aryl group will be the same, however it is not necessary that each group have the same number of carbon atoms in the chain. The oxide of the quaternary compound is generally supplied by introducing into the reaction mixture a composition such as the tetraethyl or tetrabutyl as the case may be hydroxide or chloride of the desired VB element. In preparing an ammonium species, the organic substituted chloride, bromide, or hydroxide is useful. In preparing the phosphonium species of the zeolite, tetraethyl or tetrabutyl as the case may be phosphonium chlcride is particularly desirable as a means of inccrporating the quaternary compound in the zeolite. The other elements of Group VB behave similarly and thus zeolites containing the same can be prepared by the same manipulative procedure substituting another Group VB metal for nitrogen.It should be realized that the oxide can be supplied from more than one source. The reaction mixture can be prepared either batchwise or continuously. Crystal size and crystallization time of the zeolite composition will vary with the nature of the reaction mixture employed and the crystallization conditions. The quaternary compounds need not be used as such. They may be produced in situ by the addition of the appropriate precursors. These precursors comprise a compound characterized by the formula R1RSR3L whereR1, R2 and R3 are selected from alkyl, substituted alkyl, aryl, substituted aryl, cycloalkyl, substituted cycloalkyl and hydrogen and L is an element of Group VB and a compound of the formula R4L where R4 is alkyl, substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl, substituted cycloalkyl, aryl and substituted aryl and L is an electronegative group. According to a special embodiment, the method of the zeolite preparation can be practiced using the compound R1R2R3L alone.Thus, in specific embodiments one may use as the source of R20, amines or phosphines either primary, secondary or tertiary as well as diaries without addition of any R4X. Zeolite preparation is facilitated by the presence of at least 0.001 , preferably at least 0.01 , and still more preferably at least 0.1 seed crystals based on total weight of crystalline product . ZSM 48 is described in U.S. Application Ser.No. G03,142, filed January 18, 1979. ZSM 48 can be identified, in terms of moles of anhydrous oxides per 100 moles of silica as follows O to 1 15 RN O to 1.5 M2 nO O to 2 A1203 lOO SiO2 wherein M is at least one cation having a valence n, RN is a C1 C20 organic compound having at least one amine functional group of peak7, and wherein the composition is characterized by the distinctive X ray diffraction pattern as shown in Table 3 below. It is recognized that, particularly when the composition contains tetrahedral, framework aluminum, a fraction of the amine functional groups may be protonated. The doubly protonated form, in conventional notation, would be RNH 20 and is equivalent in stoichiometry to 2RN H20. The X ray diffraction pattern of ZSM 48 has the following significant lines TABLE 3 CHARACTERISTIC LINES OF ZSM 48 d Relative Intensity 11.9 W S 10.2 W 7.2 W 5.9 W 4.2 VS 3.9 VS These values were determined by standard techniques. The radiation was the K alpha doublet of copper, and and a scintillation counter spectrometer with a strip chart pen recorder was used. The peak heights, I, and the positions as a function of 2 times theta, where theta is the Bragg angle, were read from the spectrometer chart. From these, the relative intensities, 100 I Io where Io is the intensity of the strongest line or peak, and d obs. , the interplanar spacing in A, corresponding to the recorded lines, were calculated. In Table 3 the relative intensities are given in terms of the symbols W weak,VS very strong and W S weak to strong.Ion exchange of the sodium ion with cations reveals substantially the same pattern with some minor shifts in interplanar spacing and variation in relative intensity. Other minor variations can occur depending on the silica to alumina mole ratio of the particular sample, as well as if it has been subjected to thermal treatment. Highly siliceous ZSM 48 can be prepared from a reaction mixture containing a source of silica, RN, an alkali metal oxide, e.g. sodium and water, and having a composition, in terms of mole ratios of oxides, falling within the folowing ranges REACTANTS BROAD PREFERRED Al2O3 SiO2 O to 0.02 0 to 0.01 Na SiO2 O to 2 0.1 to 1.0 RN SiO2 0.01 to 2.0 0.05 to 1.0 OH SiO2 O to 0.25 0 to 0.1 H20 SiO2 10 to 100 20 to 70 H added SiO2 O to 0.2 0 to 0.05 wherein RN is a C1 C20 organic compound having amine functional group of pea27, and maintaining the mixture at 80 2500C until crystals of ZSM 48 are formed. H added is moles acid added in excess nf tht moles of hydroxide added. In calculating H added and OH values, the term acid H includes both hydronium icn, whether free or coordinated and aluminum. An amine hydrochloride would be a mixture of amine and HC1. In preparing the highly siliceous form of ZSM 48 no alumina is added. The only aluminum present occurs as an impurity. Preferably, crystallization is carried out under pressure in an autoclave or static bomb reactor, at 80 to 2500C. Thereafter, the crystals are separated from the liquid and recovered. The composition can be prepared utilizing materials which supply the appropriate oxide. Such compositons include sodium silicate, silica hydrosol, silica gel, silicic acid,RN, sodium hydroxide, sodium chloride, etc. RN is a Cl Cz organic compound containing at least one amine functional group of pKa 7 and includes such compounds as C3 C18 primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, cyclic amine, such as piperidine, pyrrolidine and piperazine, and polyamines such as NH2CnH2n NH2 wherein n is 4 12. Many cf the specific zeolites described, when prepared in the presence of organic cations, are unsuitable for use herein, possibly because the intra crystalline free space is occupied by organic cations from the forming solution. Such zeolites may be made suitable by heating in an inert atmosphere at 5a00C for one hour, for example, followed by base exchange with ammonium salts followed by calcinatiom at 540 0C in air. The presence of organic cations in the forming solution may not be absolutely essential to the formation of this type zeolite however, the presence of these cations does appear to favor the formation of many members of this special class of zeolite.More generally, it is desirable to activate this type zeolite by base exchange with ammonium salts followed by calcination in air at about 5400C for from about 15 minutes to about 24 hours. Natural zeolites may sometimes be converted to this type zeolite by various activation procedures and other treatments such as base exchange, steaming, alumina extraction and calcination, alone or in combinations. Natural minerais which may be so treated include ferrierite, brewsterite, stilbite, dachiardite, epistilbite, heulandite, and clinoptilolite. In a preferred aspect, the zeolites hereof are selected as those having a crystal framework density, in the dry hydrogen form, of not less than about 1.6 grams per cubic centimeter.

The term porous matrix includes inorganic compositions with which the highly siliceous zeolites can be combined, dispersed or otherwise intimately admixed, wherein the matrix may be active or inactive.It is to be understood that the porosity of the compositions employed as a matrix can either be inherent in the particular material cr it can be introduced by mechanical or chemical means. Representative matrices which can be employed include metals and alloys thereof, sintered metals and sintered glass, asbestos, silicon carbide aggregates, pumice, firebrick, diatomaceous earths, and inorganic oxides. Inorganic compositions especially those of a siliceous nature are preferred.Of these matrices, inorganic oxides such as clay, chemically treated clay, silica, silica alumina, etc.are particularly preferred because of their superior porosity, attrition resistance and stability. The compositing of the highly siliceous zeolites of this invention with an inorganic oxide can be achieved by several methods wherein the highly siliceous zeolites are reduced to a particle size less than 40 morons, preferably less than 10 microns, and intimately admixed with an inorganic oxide while the latter is in a hydrous state such as in the form of hydrosol, hydrogel, wet gelatinous precipitate, or in a dried state, or a mixture thereof. Thus, finely divided highly siliceous zeolites can be mixed directly with a siliceous gel formed by hydrolyzing a basic solution of alkali metal silicate with an acid such as hydrochloric, sulfuric, acetic, etc. The mixing of the three components can be accomplished in any desired manner, such as in a ball mill or other types of mills.The highly siliceous zeolites also may be dispersed in a hydrosol obtained by reacting an alkali metal silicate with an acid or alkaline coagulant. The hydrosol is then permitted to set in mass to a hydrogel which is thereafter dried and broken into pieces of desired shape or dried by conventional spray drying techniques or dispersed through a nozzle into a bath of oil or other water immiscible suspending medium to obtain spheroidally shaped bead particles of catalyst such as described in U.S. Patent Nc. 2,384,946. The siliceous gel thus obtained is washed free of soluble salts and thereafter dried and or calcined as desired. In a like manner, the highly siliceous zeolites may be incorporated with an aluminiferous oxide. Such geis and hydrous oxides are well known in the art and may be prepared, for example by adding ammonium hydroxide, ammonium carbonate, etc. to a salt of aluminum, such as aluminum chloride, aluminum sulfate, aluminum nitrate, etc. in an amount sufficient to form aluminum hydroxide which, upon drying, is converted to alumina. The highly siliceous zeolites may be incorporated with the aluniferous oxide while the latter is in the form of hydrosol, hydrogel, or wet gelatinous precipitate or hydrous oxide, or in the dried state. The inorganic oxide may also consist of raw clay or a clay mineral which has ben treated with an acid medium to render it active. The highly siliceous zeolites can be incorporated into the clay simply by blending the two and fashioning the mixture into desired shapes. Suitable clays include attapulgite, kaolin, sepiolite, polygarskite, kaolinite, halloysite, plastic ball clays, bentonite, montmorillonite, illite, chlorite, etc. Other useful matrices include powders of refractory oxides, such as alumina, alpha alumina, etc., having very low internal pore volume. Preferably, these materials have substantially no inherent catalytic activity of their cwn. Conversion conditions for the process of the present invention comprise a temperature from between about 4500F 2330c and about 8000F 4270c , preferably from between about 5000F 26000 and about 7000F 3720c an olefin partial pressure from between about 0.5 psia 4 kPa and about 100 psia 690 Pa , preferably from between about 1 psia 7 kPa and about 50 psia 345 kPa , and a WHSV from between about 0.1 and about 25, preferably from between about 0.5 and about 15. The following examples will serve to illustrate the invention. It is to be understood that these examples are merely illustrative and are not to be construed as limiting the scope of the invention. Example 1 Highly siliceous ZSM 5 with a silica to alumina mole ratio of about 1600 to 1 was prepared according to the procedure as set out below.Prereacted organic preparation The following materials were charged te an autoclave 0.30 parts methylethyl ketone, 0.18 parts tri n propylamine and 0.15 parts n propyl bromide. The contents were mixed with gentie agitation for 15 minutes. The agitation was stopped and 1 part water was charged to the autoclave. The autoclave was sealed and heated to 2200F 1050c and held at 2200F 1050c for 15 hours. After this reaction period the temperature was raised to 3200 16000 and the unreacted organics were flashed off. The aqueous phase was removed containing the prereacted organics and contained 1.44t weight nitrogen.

The extrudates were dried, calcined in flowing N2 for 3 hours at 10000F 5380c then ion exchanged twice with 1N NH4NO3 solution 5 parts NH4N03 solution 1 part zeolite for 1 hour at ambient temperature and dried. Example 2 Conventional HZSM 5 catalyst with a silica to alumina mole ratio of about 70 to 1 was prepared as follows A sodium silicate solution was prepared Sy mixing 7.6 parts water, 9.1 parts ice and 28.9 parts sodium silicate 28.7 wt. SiO2, 8.9 wt. Na,O, 62.4 wt. H20 followed by addition of 0.08 partsDaxad 27 W.R. Grace Chemical Division . The organic salt solution was prepared by mixing 0.30 parts MEK, 0.18 parts tri n propylamine and 0.15 parts n propyl bromide per part water. The mixture was reacted at about 100 110 0C for 17 hours. An acid solution was prepared by mixing 12.1 parts of the organic solution with 2.4 parts water and 6.0 parts ice followed by 1 part alumina sulfate 17.2 wt. Awl 203 , 4 parts sulfuric acid rJ97 wt. H2S04 and 1.3 parts NaCl. These solutions were mixed in an agitated vessel and 4.1 parts NaCI were added. The gel molar ratios expressed as oxides are the following SiO2 A1203 82 Na2O Al203 52 The mixture was heated to about 95 llO0C. When more than 65 of the gel was crystallized, the temperature was increased to IO 1700C and held there until crystallization was complete. Unreacted organics were removed by flashing and the contents cooled. The zeolite was washed by decantation and dried. The dried zeolite was then mixed with alumina and water. It was extruded into 1 16 pellets and dried. The extruded material contained 65 parts ZSM 5 per 35 parts alumina. The dried extrudate was calcined for three hours at 5380C in flowing nitrogen. After cooling, the extrudate was contacted with an ammonium nitrate exchange solution about 0.4 lb. NH4NO3 lb. extrudate for one hour at ambient temperature. This exchange was repeated until the sodium level was less than 0.05 wt. t. After this exchange, the extrudate was washed, dried and calcined in flowing air at 538OC for three hours. Examples 3 to 5 In Examples 3 to 5, conventional HZSM 5 catalyst in extrudate form with a silica to alumina mole ratio of about 70 to 1 prepared according to Example 2 was employed. The chargestock was a propylene butylene mixture of the following composition 57 43 olefin blend of propylene butylene. The olefinic feedstock was contacted with 2.65 grams of the conventional HZSM 5 catalyst in a 5 16 stainless steel reactor at atmospheric pressure with aWHSV of about 2. It was necessary to start at a low temperature about 4500F E2330c9j with this catalyst to avoid excessive aromatic formation with resulting low volume vield . At this temperature the liquid product contained considerable material boiling above the gasoline range 90 B.P. 4840F t2520c . As the catalyst coked up and the temperature was raised and the gasoline product became acceptable. Results for Examples 3 to 5 are given in Table 4. Example 6 In this example, the catalyst prepared according to Example 1 was reacted in accordance with the same conditions as used in Examples 3 to 5 and with the same feedstock as employed in Examples 3 to 5. The results for Example 6 are illustrated in Table 4. In using high siliceous ZSM 5, it was not necessary to start at a low temperature, as was the case for conventional ZSM 5. At an initial temperature of about 5400F 2830c , olefin conversion was high, aromatic content low less than 1 weight percent and gasoline product properties were excellent liquid product with 90 B.P. at 3880F 1980c with an octane number of 94 R O . By comparison of Example 5 conventionalHZSM 5 , with Example 6 highly siliceous HZSM 5 , the improvement attainable by use of the process of the instant invention is readily demonstrated. The octane number obtained using highly siliceous HZSM 5 is three numbers higher than that obtained using conventionalHZSM 5. This represents a substantial increase in octane number.
