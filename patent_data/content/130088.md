# PLASMA DEVELOPABLE NEGATIVE RESIST COMPOSITIONS FOR ELECTRON BEAM, X RAY AND OPTICAL LITHOGRAPHY

## Abstract
A negative resist composition including a polymeric mat rix material, a polymerizable monomer, and an onium salt radiation sensitive initiator. The monomer is polymerized by irradiating the resist with an e beam, x ray, or ultraviolet source and heating the exposed resist. The resist is developed by a dry etchant such as plasma or a reactive ion etchant.
