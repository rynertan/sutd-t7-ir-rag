## Description
Therapeutic and Preventive Agent containing Dolichol The invention relates to a therapeutically treating and preventive agent containing as a pharmaceutically effective component dolichol or a phosphate thereof. The invention agent is effective to treat and prevent, in particular, hyperuricuria, hyperlipemia, arteriosclerosis, diabetes and hepatic diseases and then improve lipometabolism. Dolichol is a polyprenol having the following structure and qccurs in yeasts and mammals. EMI1.1 wherein n represents an integer of 14 to 24. Dolichol is characterized by the presence of two trans isoprene units and a cis isoprene unit attached thereto and a saturated alcohol terminal a te inal isoprene unit. Dolichol is supposed to play an important role in life conservation of organisms and expected to be available as an active ingredient for various pharmaceuticals. Under these circumstances, we have examined the pharmaceutical availability of dolichol for a long time. As a result of our researches, we have found that dolichol is unexpectedly effective to treat and prevent hyperuricuria such as gout, hyperlipemia, arteriosclerosis, diabetes and hepatic diseases and then improve lipometabolism. Dolichol to be used in the embodiments of the present invention may be prepared by any convenient method. That is to say, it may be extracted, for example, from swine liver cf. F.W. Burgos et al.,Biochemical Journal, 88, 470 1963 or swine pancreas cf. Japanese Patent Application No. 12622 1983 . Alternately, it may be prepared by fermentation with microorganisms. Furthermore it may be chemically synthesized The aforementioned chemical structure indicates that dolichol may occur in various forms depending on n. Dolichol being used in the present invention may be either a single compound wherein n is a particular integer e.g. n is 19 or a mixture of compounds wherein n represents various integers. For example, dolichol originating from human liver is believed to consist of 0.9 of the com pound wherein n is 16 8.8 of the compound wherein n is17 36.6 of the compound wherein n is 18 37.7 of the compound wherein n is 19 12.4 of the compound wherein n its 20 3.2 of the compound wherein n is 21 and 0.7 of the compound wherein n is 22.On the other hand, dolichol originating from swine liver is believed to consist of a small amount of the compound wherein n is 10 2.5 of the compound wherein n is 16 19.8t of the compound wherein n is 17 43.5 of the compound wherein n is 18 28.6 of the compound wherein n is 19 and 5.58 of the compound wherein n is 20.Furthermore dolichol originating from yeast is believed to consist of 3.0 pf the com pound wherein n is 12 14.1 of the compound wherein n is 13 43.58 of the compound wherein n is 14 34.5 of the compound wherein n is 15 and 4.88 of the compound wherein n is 16 Dolichol to be used in the embodiments of the present invention may obviously include the dolichols as described above as well as those extracted from other animal and vegetable tissues and having various compositions. The expression dolichol phosphate as used herein means an ester which is formed by bonding the terminal hydroxyl group of dolichol to phosphoric acid and has the following chemical structure EMI4.1 wherein n represents an integer of 14 to 24 and m represents an integer of 1 to 3. Similar to free dolichol, dolichol phosphate being used in the present invention maV be a single compound wherein n is a particular integer or a mixture of compounds wherein n n represents various integers. The invention will be illustrated to the therapeutical effect below with reference to experimental examples. The effect to hyperuricuria is proved in Experimental Examples 1 and 2 that to hepatic diseases, in No. 3 that to diabetes, in Nos. 4 and 5 and that to hyperlipemia, in Nos.6 and 7.

That is, the rat had an abdominal operation under etherization to remove the right and left median lobes of liver approximately 72 on average . After suturation, the rat was fed with Oriental Solid Feed and tap water in a usual manner. After a certain period, the rat was exsangu inated under etherization. Then the liver was weighed to calculate the hepatic regeneration rate by the following equation weight of regenerated liver Weight of residual liver x 100 Weight of removed liver Regeneration Ratio . wherein the weight of residual liver was determined by subtracting the weight of the removed liver from the weight of the whole liver at the operation which was regarded 4.65 g per 100 g of body weight. 2 Effects of dolichol on the regeneration rate 30 mgfkg of a dolichol lecithin emulsion was administered intraperitoneally to a rat once a day for consecutive eight days five days preperation and three days post operation .
