# Device for propagating magnetic domains.

## Abstract
A device for propagating magnetic domains 6 , com prising a monocrystalline non magnetic substrate 1 of a material having a garnet structure and a layer 2 of an iron garnet carrying magnetic domains and grown epitaxially on the non magnetic substrate 1 . In the dodecahedral lattice sites the iron garnet comprises at least a bismuth ion and a rare earth ion selected from the group consisting of lutetium, thulium, ytterbium, whereby it combines a very high uniaxial anisotropy with a high domain mobility, which properties make the device extremely suitable for the propagation of magnetic domains having diameters from approximately 1 to approximately 2 Âµm under the influence of comparatively low driving fields.
