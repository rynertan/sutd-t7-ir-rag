# Method and apparatus for automatically controlling the rate of mass flow.

## Abstract
An improved method for automatically controlling the rate of mass flow in a system having a mass mover power ed by a power supply which is attenuated by a control de vice for transferring mass through a conduit, wherein a sig nal proportional to said mass flow is transmitted to an au tomatic control unit, characterized by the improvement among others, whereby the improved automatic control unit is provided with a process control mode in which new operating conditions are entered into the program, and the automatic control unit determines the correct mode of con trol for the new process conditions.
