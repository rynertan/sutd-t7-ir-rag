# Packing assembly for high pressure reciprocating plunger pump.

## Abstract
A packing assembly for sealing an annular space 12 between a pump plunger 16 and a pump body 20 of a reciprocating plunger pump 24 , comprises a packing assembly 10 including an elastomeric header ring 26 disposed in a high pressure end of the annular space for preventing migration of fluid through the annular space due to radial compression of the header ring at least one V shaped packing ring 42,44 disposed in the annular space behind the header ring and having a concave side 46 facing the header ring a female adapter ring 50 disposed in the annular space behind a last V shaped packer ring and a V shaped anti extrusion ring 52 disposed in the annular space between the last V shaped packing ring and the female adapter for preventing extrusion of the last V shaped packing ring between the female adapter and each of the pump plunger and the pump body.
