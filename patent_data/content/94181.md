## Description
Use of Thiadiazolylimidazolidinones to Control Aquatic Vegetation This invention concerns methods for controlling the growth of vegetation in bodies of water. A large number of thiadiazolylimidazolidinone derivatives are known in the art as terrestrial herbicides. Krenzer, for example, in U.S. Patent No.3,964,895, described the very potent terrestrial herbicide buthidazole. While there are numerous chemical agents currently available that are effective as selective terrestrial herbicies,.few agents are available for controlling the growth of aquatic vegetation in water bodies such as lake, ponds, streams, rivers and the like. Most herbicides that are effective terrestrially are not suitable for use in aquatic environments. This may be due to the fact that the terrestrial herbicides simply will not control the aquatic r egetation, the terrestrial herbicide is not stable in an aquatic environment, or because the toxicity cf the terrestrial herbicides render them unfit for use in water containing animal life. To date, none of the known thiadiazolySimida zolidinones have been used to control the growth cf aquatic plants. We have discovered that certain thia diazolylimidazolidinones can be used to control the growth of aquatic vegetation. Specifically, this invention is directed to method for controlling the growth of aquatic plants comprising contacting the plants or the water in which the plants are growing with an aquatic herbicidallyeffective amount of a thiadiazolylimidazolidinone derivative defined by the formula I EMI2.1 wherein R1 is hydrogen, C1 C6 alkyl, C2 C6 alkenyl, C2 C6 alkynyl, or halo C1 C6 alkyl R2 is hydrogen, or taken together with R4 completes a double bond. R3 is hydrogen, C1 C6 alkyl, hydroxy, C1 C6 alkoxy or C1 C6 alkanoyloxy R4 is hydroxy, C1 C6 alkoxy, C1 C6 alkanoyloxy, or taken together with R , R completes a double bond R5 is C1 C6 alkyl, C2 C6 alkenyl, C2 C6 alkynyl, halo C1 C6 alkyl, C1 C6 alkylthio, C1 C6 alkylsulfinyl, C1 C6 alkylsulfonyl, or SO2NR6R7, wherein R6 is hydrogen or C1 C6 alkyl and R7 is C1 C6 alkyl, C1 C6 alkoxy, C2 C6 alkenyl, or C2 C6 alkynyl. A preferred method for controlling aquatic vegetation employs a compound of formula I wherein 7 C1 C6 alkyl, R2 and R3 both are hydrogen, R4 is hydroxy and Ras is C1 C6 alkyl or SO2NR6R7 where R6 and 7 independently are C1 C6 alkyl. Another preferred embodiment employs a compound of formula I wherein R5 is l,l dimethylethyl. A further embodiment of this invention is an aquatic herbicide formulation comprising a thiadiazolylimidazolidinone of the formula I as an active ingredient, associated with an aquatically acceptable carrier. R1 in formula I includes a C1 C6 alkyl group. The term C1 C6 alkyl11 means both straight and branched carbon chains having up to six carbon atoms.Typical C1 C6 alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, n butyl, 2 methylpentyl, 1,2 dimethylpropyl, and the like. Methyl is preferred for R1. The term halo as used herein means fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo. Typical C2 C6 alkenyl groups include 2 propenyl, 2 butenyl, 2 methyl 3 pentenyl, and 5 hexenyl.Common C2 C6 alkynyl groups include 3 hexynyl, 2propynyl, 2 butynyl, l methyl 2 butynyl and the like. The term halo C1 C6 alkyl means a C1 C6 alkyl group substituted by one or more halo groups.Trifluoromethyl is a preferred haloalkyl group.

The compounds for this test were formulated in the following manner. Twenty milligrams of compound was weighed into a 12 ml disposable vial. To the vial containing the compound were added 1 ml of acetone and 9 ml of aqueous 0.1 percent polyoxyethylene scrbitan monooleate Tween 80 . This solution was then diluted with appropriate volumes of water to obtain solutions containing 10, 1, 0.5 and 0.25 ppm parts per million of test compound. Terminal pieces of aquatic plants such asFlorida elodea, Hydrilla verticillata taF. , hereinafter identified as hydrilla 10 cm long, without branching, were prepared for testing.

The plant is very troublesome in warm regions since it floats on water and often clogs waterways, and is very difficult to control safely. As the data presented in the Tables above demonstrate, the compounds defined herein are useful in the control of aquatic vegetative growth. A preferred embodiment of this invention is a method of eliminating and controlling the growth of aquatic plants. This method is practiced by adding the active thiadiazolyl imidazolidinone derivatives to the water containing the submerged, emergent, ditchbank or floating aquatic plants, or otherwise contacting the plants with the active compounds, for example, by applying the compounds to the sub aqueous soil in which the aquatic plants are rooted. Also provided by this invention are aquatic formulations comprising a thiadiazolylimidazolidinone derivative defined herein together with an aquatically acceptable carrier. Such aquatic formulations will contain from about 1 to about 90 percent by weight of the active imidazolidinone derivative.The compounds may be applied to the water when formulated as dusts by being admixed with a powdered solid carrier such as bentonite, Fuller s earth, diatomacecus earth, or various mineral silicates, e.g., mica, talc, pyrophyllite, and clays. The compounds may also be mixed wit surface active dispersing acents to torm concen trates to facilitate dispersion in water and to improve the wetting properties when used as sprays. If desired, the compounds may be mixed with a powdered solid carrier, together with a surface active dispersing agent, so that a wettable powder may be obtained which may be applied directly, or which may be shaken with water to make an aqueous dispersion for application in that form.These wettable powder formulations suitably contain from about 25 to about 85 percent by weight of the active ingredient, i.e., an aquatic growth regulating compound coming within the scope of the generic formulae, supra. The compounds may be dissolved in an oil, such as a hydrocarbon or chlorinated hydrocarbon oil, and the oil solution of the compound dispersed in water with the aid of a surface active dispersing agent to give a sprayable aqueous dispersion. Such sarfaceactive dispersing agents may be anionic, nonionic, or cationic surface active agents. Such surface active agents are well known, and reference is made to Hoffman et al., U.S. Patent No. 2,614,916, columns 2 4, for detailed examples of the same. The compounds useful in this embodiment of the invention may also be applied by the aerosol method.Solutions for the aerosol treatment may be prepared by dissolving the compound directly in the aerosol carrier, which is a liquid under pressure, but which is a gas at ordinary temperature e.g.200C. and atmospheric pressure or, the aerosol solution may be prepared by first dissolving the compound in a less volatile solvent, and then admixing such solution with the highly volatile liquid aerosol carrier. Further, the compounds useful as aquatic growth regulators and aquatic herbicides can also be applied in an invert emulsion formulation. An invert emulsion formulation is prepared by first making a solution of an aquatic growth regulating compound in heavy oils, such as diesel fuel, inverting oil, and the like, and combining the thus obtained solution with water under high shear stirring. The thick emulsion is placed in the water and sinks to the bottom of the lake, river, pond, or the like, and the aquatic growth regulator is gradually released to control the growth of the aquatic plants. The following is an example of an invert emulsion formulation, prepared using the compound of Example No. 2 of this application. Example 17 Invert Emulsion Compound of Example No. 2 12.5.gum Diesel fuel 333 ml Inverting oil 333 ml Vioko Rhap Inverting Oil Rhodia, Inc. Two hundred fifty milliliters of this solution is combined with 3750 ml. of water under high shear stirring to give a thick invert emulsion. The compounds useful as aquatic growth regulators and aquatic herbicides can also be applied as pellets which are prepared from a mixture of about 5 of the active ingredient, about 85 clay, and about 10 water, all percentages being by weight. The mixture is then extruded through a pellet mill using a suitably sized die, e.g., about 1 8 in. diameter. The extruded pellets are about 1 8 in. by 1 1 2 in., and are then dried to about 8 moisture content. Accordingly, one aspect of the invention is that it provides a formulation for regulating aquatic plant growth comprising as an active ingredient from 1 to 90 wt. of a compound of formula I EMI43.1 wherein RÚ is hydrogen, C1 C6 alkyl, C2 C6 alkenyl,C2 C6 alkynyl, or halo C1 C6 alkyl R2is hydrogen, or taken together with R4 completes a double bond R3 is hydrogen, C1 C6 alkyl, hydroxy, C1 C6 alkoxy, or C1 C6 alkanoyloxy This hydroxy, 4C6 alkoxy, C1 C6 alkanoyloxy, or taken together with R , R completes a double bond R5 is C1 C6 alkyl, C2 C6 alkenyl, C2 C6 alkynyl, halo C1 C6 alkyl, C1 C6 alkylthio, C1 C6 alkylsulfinyl, C1 C6 alkylsulfonyl, or SO2NR8R7 wherein R6 is hydrogen or C1 C6 alkyl R7 is C1 C6 alkyl, C1 C6 alkoxy, C2 C6 alkenyl, or C2 C6 alkynyl, associated with at least one aquatically acceptable carrier or diluent therefor. The method of controlling aquatic plant growth provided by this invention is practiced by adding to the water containing the submerged or floating plants a growth regulating or herbicidal amount of one of the herein disclosed compounds, such that a concentration of from about 0.01 to about 10 ppm of the active compound is attained. A preferred method of aquatic plant growth regulation provided by this invention is directed toward the control of plants such as water hyacinth. Such plants can be controlled by foliar or root application of a compound of this invention at a rate of about 0.01 to about 1.0 pounds per acre about 0.011 to about 1.1 kg ha . The optimum concentration of active compound for any specific aquatic weed control problem varies with the temperature, the species to be controlled, and the shape of the body of water to be treated. At higher water temperatures, less compound is generally required for a given degree of control than is needed at lower temperatures. When used to control algae or similar aquatic plant growth, the compounds will usually be employed at concentrations of about 0.1 to about 10 ppm. In terms of pounds of compound per acre of water one foot deep, 0.1 to 10 ppm is equal to about 0.3 to about 30 pounds per acre of water one foot deep. The thiadiazolylimidazolidinones employed in the method of this invention can be used in combination with other aquatic growth regulators and aquatic herbicides. Typical agents to be employed in combination treatments include fluridone, diuron, cutrine plus, aquazine, and the like. A preferred combination for use according to this invention is a thiadiazolylimidazolidinone and fluridone.
