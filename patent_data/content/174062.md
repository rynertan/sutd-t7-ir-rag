# PROCESS FOR THE DEPOLYMERIZATION OF POLYESTER SCRAP

## Abstract
Polyethylene terephthalate scrap is depolymerized to bis hydroxyethyl terephthalate and or its oligomer BHT by supplying the scrap, together with ethylene glycol, to a reactor containing molten BHT under the following condi tions a the molten BHT is to have a glycol to acid component equivalent ratio of 1.3 to 2.0 b the ratio by weight of the acid component of the molten BHT to that of the polyester scrap is to be 1 4 to 2 1 c the ratio of polyester scrap to ethylene glycol is such as to give a glycol to acid component equivalent ratio between the limits of 1.3 to 2.0. The depolymerization is performed at 215 to 250 C with agitation of the reactants, after which a part of the product in the reactor can be removed to a polymerizing reactor.
