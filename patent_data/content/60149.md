# Image scanning method and device.

## Abstract
An image scanning method, for producing an image signal indicative of the intensity of adjacent element parts of the image, comprising displacing an array of detectors over the image transversely to a direction of alignment of the detectors in the array and repeatedly transferring into said image signal element signals serially supplied from succes sive detectors of the array, such element signal being indicative of the intensity of an element part of the image being scanned by the corresponding detector, characterized in that said array comprises a series of odd detectors and a series of even detectors, the detector in each series being aligned along said direction and intercalated between adja cent detectors of the other series, and in that the element signals from the odd detectors are transferred in sequence alternatively with a sequence of the element signals from the even detectors.
