# Stacked complementary metal oxide semiconductor inverter.

## Abstract
An MOS transistor of second conductivity type is provided which is formed in a semiconductor substrate 101 of first conductivity type and includes a first source region 105 of second conductivity type, a first drain region 106 of second conductivity type, and a gate electrode 104 provided on a gate insulation layer 107 . Further, an MOS transistor of first conductivity type is provided which is stacked on the MOS transistor of second conductivity type and includes a second source region 114 , a second drain region 115 and the gate electrode 104 . The first and second source regions are connected to each other through a conductive layer 109‚ÇÅ which is selected from a given metal layer and a given metal silicide layer.
