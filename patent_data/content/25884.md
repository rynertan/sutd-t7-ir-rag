Inflammation is a disease process characterized by redness, fever, swelling, and pain. Arthritis, in its various forms, is the most prevalent, chronic, and severe of the inflammatory diseases. Traumatic injury and infection also involve inflammation, and antiinflammatory drugs are often used in their treatment.The usefulness of most commercial antiinflammatories is limited because of toxicity and adverse sideeffects. Many produce gastric irritation and other effects, such as changes in blood cells and central nervous system. Adreno cortical steroids produce gastric irritation and suppresion of normal adrenal function. In addition to anti.inflammatory properties, compounds within the scope of this invention have demonstrated analgesic activity in a test procedure. This additional property is desirable in treatment of arthritis or related diseases however, the compounds which exhibit this property can be employed solely to alleviate pain. Also, the present invention is directed to intermediates useful in preparation of antiinflammatory compounds.

Synthesis The compounds of Formula I can be prepared from 2,3 diarylpyrroles. One method of preparation of 2,3 diarylpyrroles involves reaction of substituted a aminodeoxybenzoins with acetylene diesters, followed by hydrolysis and decarboxylation according to the procedure used byJ. Szmuszkovicz,et al., J. Med. Chem., 9, 527 1966 and by U.S. Patent 3,462,451, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference, for the synthesis of 2,3 bis 4 methoxyphenyl pyrrole. Scheme I . Scheme IEMI8.1 Another method of preparation of 2,3 diarylpyrroles is a modification of the procedure of T. Severin and H.Poehlmann, Chem. Ber., 110, 491 1977 , hereby incorporated by reference, which described the preparation of monoaryl pyrroles. By using substituted desoxybenzoins, the desired 2,3 diarylpyrroles are formed. Scheme II . Sc .eme EMI8.2 Preparation of 2,3 diaryl 4 alkylpyrroles can be accomplished by several methods. First, 4,5 diarylpyrrole 3 carboxylate esters, prepared, for instance, by the method of A. M. van Leusen, et al., Tet. Letters, 5337 1972 can be reduced to the 2,3 diaryl 4 methylpyrroles by lithium aluminum hydride following the general procedure of R. L. Hinman and S. Theodoropulos, J. Org. Chem., 28, 3052 1963 , hereby incorporated by reference.EMI9.1 Secondly, 2,3 diaryl 4 alkylpyrroles can be prepared by the general procedure of N. Engel andW. Steglich, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl., 17, 676 1978 , hereby incorporated by reference, fromN allylcarboxamides.EMI9.2 These methods of preparation of 2,3 diarylpyrroles are described in European Patent 5,156 U.S. ApplicationSerial No. 10,259, filed February 8, 1979 . l Alkyl or benzyl 2,3 diarylpyrroles can be prepared from the corresponding 2,3 diarylpyrroles by treatment with a strong base, such as sodium hydride, followed by alkylation using an alkyl or benzyl halide or other suitable alkylating reagent, such as methyl iodide L signifies an appropriate leaving group, such as halide or sulfonate .EMI10.1 Introduction of the a polyfluoroalkylmethanol group can be accomplished in several ways first, by reaction of a 2,3 diarylpyrrole with a fluorinated ketone or aldehyde or their various hydrates.EMI10.2 This reaction can be conducted in a sealed pressure reactor at temperature from ambient to 2000C.It can also be conducted in a refluxing solvent such as toluene, in a flask with the fluorinated ketone or aldehyde, such as hexafluoroacetone monohydrate, sesquihydrate or trihydrate or trifluoroacetaldehyde hydrate. Acidic catalysts such as All3, BF3, p toluenesulfonic acid or trifluoroacetic acid can be used but are not required. Reaction times are usually 4 24 hours. The use of hexafluoroacetone trihydrate in ref fluxing toluene without catalyst is preferred. Secondly, addition of Grignard reagents to 1 4, 5 diaryl 1H pyrrol 2 yl polyfluoro l alkanones, can give compounds of Formula I. This reaction is particularly useful when R5 isC1 C3 alkyl.EMI11.1 1 4, 5 Diaryl lH pyrrol 2 yl polyfluoro l alkanones can be prepared from the corresponding 2,3 diarylpyrroles with R6 H, alkyl, benzyl or substituted benzyl , by treatment with a polyfluorinated acid anhydride in the absence or presence of a base, such as N,N dimethylaniline, The reaction can be run in any solvent which is inert to the reactants, at temperatures from 780C to the boiling point of the solvent, preferably at OOC. EMI11.2 R6 H, alkyl, benzyl or substituted benzyl Alternatively, the R6 group R6 r H can be introduced after the polyfluQroacyl group has been introduced into compounds with R6 H.The 1 4,5 diaryl 1H pyrrol 2 yl polyfluoro 1 alkanone with R6 H is contacted with a strong base, such as sodium hydride, followed by alkylation using an alkyl or benzyl halide or other suitable alkylating reagent, e.g., methyl iodide L signifies an appropriate leaving group, such as halide or sulfonate .EMI12.1 Thirdly, reaction of 1 4,5 diaryl lH pyrrol 2 yl polyfluoro 1 alkanones with reducing agents, such as NaBH4 or the like, can give compounds ofFormula I where R5 H.EMI12.2 Fourthly, compounds of Formula I withR6 and or R7 H can be prepared by alkylation of the corresponding compounds with R6 and or R7 H. Alkylation can occur on either or both the NH or OH, depending on the conditions of the reaction. Often mixtures of alk.ylated products are obtained. These alkylations can be conducted in the presence of a base, such as potassium carbonate, pyridine, triethylamine, potassiumt butoxide, sodium hydride or the like. L signifies an appropriate leaving group . EMI13.1 Fifthly, compounds of Formula I withR7 alkanoyl, benzoyl or substituted benzoyl, or COOR8 can be prepared from the corresponding compound with R7 H by treatment with a base followed by reaction with an acid chloride, or alternatively, by direct reaction with an acid anhydride.EMI13.2 Pharmaceutically suitable salts of the compounds of formula I can be of two types. First, when one or both aryl groups is a dialkylaminophenyl or a 3 pyridyl group, acid addition salts can be prepared by treatment of the free base I with the appropriate acid. Second, pharmaceutically suitable metal salts forming the salt of the acidic OH can be prepared by treatment of compounds of the formula I .with R7 H with strong bases such as hydroxides, alkoxies, or the like. In the following examples, all parts are by weight and temperatures are in degrees centigrade unless otherwise specified. Preparation 1 2,3 Diphenylpyrrole Method A A.

The compounds of formula II are intermediates useful for the preparation of compounds of formulaI. The subsclass IIa of formula II which has antiinflammatory properties can be either directly employed as anti inflammatory agents or can be used as intermediates in formation of the compounds of formula I. b Dosage Forms The antiarthritic and analgesic agents of this invention can be administered to treat arthritis or alleviate pain by any means that produces contact of the active agent with the agent s site of action in the body of a mammal. They can be administered by any conventional means available for use in conjunction with pharmaceuticals either as individual therapeutic agents or in a combintion of therapeutic agents. They can be administered alone, but are generally administered with a pharmaceutical carrier selected on the basis of the chosen route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. The tosage administered will, of course, vary depending upon known factors such ds the pharmacodynamic characteristics of the particular agent, and its mode and route of administration age, health, and weight of the recipient nature and extent of symptons, kind of concurrent treatment, frequency of treatment, and the effect desired. Usually a daily dosage of active ingredient of formula I can be about 0.01 to 40 milligrams per kilogram of body weight. Ordinarily, 0.05 to 20, and preferably 0.1 to 4 milligrams per kilogram per day given in divided doses 2 to 4 times a day or in sustained release form is effective to obtain desired results. Usually, a daily dosage of active ingredient of formula IIa can be about 1 to 100 milligrams per kilogram of body weight. Ordinarily, 2 to 50, and preferably 5 to 25 milligrams per kilogram per day given in divided doses 2 to 4 times a day or in sustained release form is effective to obtain desired results. Dosage forms compositions suitable for internal administration contain from about 1.0 milligram to about 500 milligram of active ingredient per unit for the formula I compounds and 50 to 500 milligrams of active ingredient per unit for the formula IIa compounds. In these pharmaceutical compositions, the active ingredient will ordinarily be present in an amount of about 0.5 95 by weight based on the total weight of the composition. The active ingredient can be administered orally in solid dosage forms, such as capsules, tablets, and powders, or in liquid dosage forms, such as elixirs, syrups, and suspensions it can also be administered parenterally, in sterile liquid dosage forms. Gelatin capsules contain the active ingredient and powdered carriers, such as lactose, sucrose, mannitol, starch, cellulose derivatives, magnesium stearate, stearic acid, and the like. Similar diluents can be usad to make compressed tablets. Both tablets and cap sules can be manufactured as sustained release products to provide for continuous release of medication over a period of hours. Compressed tablets can be sugar coated or film coated to mask any unpleasant taste and protect the tablet from the atmosphere, or enteric coating for selective disintegration in the gastro intestinal tract. Liquid dosage forms for oral administration can contain coloring and flavoring to increase patient acceptance. In general, water, a suitable oil, saline, aqueous dextrose glucose , and related sugar solutions and glycols such as propylene glycol or polyethylene glycols are suitable carriers for parenteral solutions.Solutions for parenteral administration contain preferably a water soluble salt of the active ingredient, suitable stabilizing agents, and if necessary, buffer substances. Antioxidizing agents such as sodium bisulfite, sodium sulfite, or ascorbic acid either alone or combined are suitable stabilizing agents. Also used are citric acid and its salts and sodium EDTA. In addition parenteral solutions can contain preservatives, such as benzalkonium chloride, methyl or propylparaben and chlorobutanol. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences, E. W. Martin, a standard reference text in this field. Useful pharmaceutical dosage forms for administration of the compounds of this invention can be illustrated as follows Capsules A large number of unit capsules are prepared by filling standard two piece hard gelatin capsules each with 50 milligrams of powdered active ingredient, 175 milligrams of lactose, 24 milligrams of talc, and 6 milligrams magnesium stearate. A mixture of active ingredient in soybean oil is prepared and injected by means of a positive displacement pump into gelatin to form soft gelatin capsules containing 50 milligrams of the active ingredient. The capsules are washed in petroleum ether and dried. Tablets A large number of tablets are prepared by conventional procedures so that the dosage unit is 50 milligrams of active ingredient, 0.2 milligrams of colloidal silicon dioxide, 5 milligrams of magnesium stearate, 275 milligrams of microcrystalline cellulose, 11 milligrams of cornstarch and 98.8 milligrams of lactose. Appropriate coatings may be applied to increase palatability or delay absorption. Injectable A parenteral position suitable for administration by injection is prepared by stirring 1.5 by weight of active ingredient in 10 by volume propylene glycol and water. The solution is sterilized by filtration. Suspension An aqueous suspension is prepared for oral administration so that each 5 milliliters contain 10 milligrams of finely divided active ingredient, 200 milligrams of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, 5 milligrams of sodium benzoate, 1.0 grams of sorbitol solution, U.S.P., and 0.025 milliliters of vanillin. Injectable A parenteral composition suitable for administration by injection is prepared by stirring 1 by weight of active ingredient in sodium chloride injection U.S.P. XV and sterilizing by filtration. Use To detect and compare the anti inflammatory activities of compounds in this series and standard drugs, a test was used based on a standard model of arthritis for which there is good correlation with human efficacy. The model is adjuvant induced arthritis in rats. Federation Proceedings, Vol. 32, No. 2, 1973, Models Used for the Study and Therapy of RheumatoidArthritis Symposium of the American Society forPharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics states The rat polyarthritis produced by intradermal injection of a suspension of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is mineral oil adjuvant has been used extensively for the screening of drugs of potential use in rheumatoid arthritis. Compounds of this invention have shown activity in adjuvant induced arthritis in rats which is widely recognized as a good model of human rheumatoid arthritis.

Wistar male rats Charles River BreedingLaboratories, Wilmington, Mass. weighing 175 220 grams were injected subcutaneously with. 0.1 ml of adjuvant in the plantar area of the right hind paw. The adjuvant was prepared by bead milling, heat killed, lyophilizedMycobacterium butyricum Difco t0640 in light mineral oil Fisher Scientific Co. 0 119 Paraffin OilSaybolt Viscosity 125 135 5 mg ml. Twenty non arthritic control rats were injected with mineral oil, The animals received water and Wayne Lab Blox ad libitum . The rats were held for 14 days to allow the development of polyarthritis. The volume of the uninjected, left hind paw of each rat was measured by using a Ugo Basile Volume Differential Meter, Model 7101.Adjuvant injected rats showing no evidence of arthritis were discarded and the rthritic rats were distributed into groups of 10 having equal mean paw volumes with equal standard deviation. Non arthritic oil injected control rats were distributed to 2 groups of 10.Suspensions of test compounds were prepared for dosing by bead milling 4 mm glass beads in rubber stoppered serum bottles for 4 5 hours in aqueous 1 polyvinyl alcohol, 5 gum acacia and 0.5 methylparaben. Test compounds were given orally by gavage once daily for 7 days days 14 20 . The 2 groups of oil injected, non arthritic control rats and the 2 groups of arthritic control rats received vehicle only for 7 days. Paw volumes uninjected left hind paw were measured 20 hours after the last dose on day 21 . while on a 10 hour light 14 hour dark cycle Percent decrease from control mean paw volume was calculated with the following formula Arthritic Vehicle Control Arthritic Treatment Mean Paw Volume ml Mean Paw Volume ml X 100 Arthritic Vehicle Control Non Arthritic Vehicle Mean Paw Volume m1 Control Mean Paw Volume ml Decrease from Control Mean Paw Volume Dose response regression lines of the decrease were plotted on semi log paper and the EDso for decrease from control paw volume was estimated by inspection. A procedure for detecting and comparing the anal gesic activity of compounds in this series and standard drugs for which there is a good correlatior with human efficacy is the phenylquinone writhing test. Phenylguinone Writhing Test The phenyiquinone writhing test, modified from Siegmund, et al., Proc. Soc. Sxp. Biol. Med., 95, 729 1957 , was employed. A test compound suspended in 18 methylcellulose was given orally to fasted 17 21 hours female white mice, 5 20 animals per double blind test. Aqueous 0.01 phenyl E benzoquinone phenyl quinone was injected intraperitoneally at 24 minutes later using 0.20 ml per mouse. Commencing at 30 minutes after the oral administration of the test com pound, the mice were observed for 10 minutes for a characteristic stretching or writhing syndrome which is indicative of pain induced by phenylquinone. The effective analgesic dose for 50 of the mice ED50 was calculated by the mcving average method of Thompson, W. R., Bact. Rev., 11, 115 145 1947 . RESULTS The antiarthritic and analgesic activity of some compounds of this invention are summarized in Table VI for the formula I compounds. The results are summarized in Table VII for the formula IIa compounds.
