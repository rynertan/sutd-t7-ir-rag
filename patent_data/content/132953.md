# IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO THE DISPLAYING OF LARGE PHOTOGRAPHIC PRINTS OR TRANSPARENCIES

## Abstract
A photographic print or transparency 1 is displayed by providing eyelets 27 along the edges of a display sheet 3 incorporating the photographic print or transparency and mounting the display sheet under tension within a peripheral frame 4 using springs 29 connected between the eyelets and runners 22 received in a track 21 of the frame. A photo graphic print may be mounted on a tear resistant flexible backing sheet 2 to form the display sheet. Transparent tape may be applied to the edges of a photographic transparency to form the display sheet.
