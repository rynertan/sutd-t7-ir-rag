# Robotic wrist.

## Abstract
A robotic manipulator wrist has one part 10 rotatable relative to the other part 12 of the wrist gear train means 16, 18, 20, operates to rotate the end effector shaft 14 when a brake clutch 36 is applied to prevent relative movement between the two uarts 10 and 12, and to rotate one part 10 relative to the other part 12 when a second brake clutch 38 is applied to prevent relative movement between the end effector gear 18 and the intermediate gear 16.
