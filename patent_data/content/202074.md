# Bias generator circuit.

## Abstract
A bias generator circuit includes a first high voltage for biasing a N well region and a second delayed and lower voltage basing a source region of a P channel field effect transistor so as to increase latch up immunity. The generator circuit includes a high voltage generator and a multiplier circuit responsive to a power supply voltage for generating a first voltage level for biasing the N well region. A delay network is responsive to the first voltage for generating a delay voltage. A level detection circuit is responsive to the delay voltage and the power supply voltage for generating a control signal when the delayed voltage reaches a predeter mined level. A control device is responsive to the control signal for generating a second voltage for biasing the source region of the P channel field effect transistor. The second voltage level is delayed and lower than the first voltage level so that the PN junction is reverse biased to increase latch up immunity.
