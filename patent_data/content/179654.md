# Process for the preparation of 5,6,7,8 tetrahydrofolic acid.

## Abstract
5,6,7,8 Tetrahydrofolic acid is produced by dissolving and or suspending folic acid or dihydrofolic acid in an aqueous solution containing an inorganic base, thereafter bringing the resulting solution or suspension into contact with hydrogen in the presence of a nobel metal catalyst while maintaining its pH at 5 to 9, thereby catalytically hydrogenat ing the said acid into 5,6,7,8 tetrahydrofolic acid. The tetrahydrofolic acid can be stored stably for pro longed periods if precipitated from the reaction mixture and sealed in combination with a deoxidizer under inert gas. Alternatively, after hydrogenation the catalyst can be re moved from the reaction mixture leaving the tetrahydrofolic acid and base in solution, and the solution containing said acid and base can be stored for future use after freezing and sealing it under an inert gas atmosphere.
