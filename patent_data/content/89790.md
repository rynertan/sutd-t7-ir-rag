# Conductor roll for electrotreating of metal strip.

## Abstract
A conductor roll used for masking one face of a metal strip while the other face is being electro treating comprises an elastomeric covered cylinder having a metallic contact ring 3 in the center thereof for electrical contact with the strip being treated. To minimize high transfer current densities, each edge of the contact ring has a cantilevered flange 4 overlying a portion of the elastomer 5 . It has been found, due to differential thermal expansion at operating temperature of both the elastomer and the metal contact ring that the cantilevered flange section of the contact ring is forced up to an excessive extent, resulting in high bending stresses generated in the strip at the region of the contact ring elastomer interface. By providing a taper on the can tilever flange section to compensate for the difference in thermal expansion, bending stresses in the strip are reduced to insignificant values, thereby eliminating creases and scratches in the strip.
