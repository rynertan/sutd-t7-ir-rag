# Method of operating a mixer type hot metal car for the transport of molten iron and a device for carrying out the method.

## Abstract
A hot metal car 3 is used for the transport of molten pig iron from a blast furnace to a steel making plant, the car 3 having an opening through which it is filled and emptied. To restrict heat loss from the car 3 , the opening is closed by a disposable cover 10 which is at least partly lost into the molten iron during the course of the emptying or filling of the car at the end of the journey from the blast furnace to steel plant and back.
