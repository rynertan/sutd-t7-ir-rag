# PSEUDO GRAPHITE ELECTRODE MATERIAL OBTAINED BY PYROLYSIS

## Abstract
An electrode material is made of a carbonaceous mate rial obtained by the pyrolysis of an organic compound capable of forming the graphite structure. This carbonaceous material is such that the spacing of 002 planes, d002, is at least 3.37Å and the crystallite size in the directionof c axis, Lc, is not more than 220 Å, as determined by X ray wide angle diffractiometry, and the line width pp between peaks in the first differential of the absorption spectrum of electron spin resonance is at least 10 gauss. Classes of organic compound wherein C C bonds change to a benzene structure on pyrolysis are disclosed. Pyrolysis can be at 300 3,000 for 10 minutes to 20 hours. The electrode material can be in various forms and is capable of providing a stable secondary battery that pro duces high electromotive force and which has high energy density.
