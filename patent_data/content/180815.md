# Variable speed variable reluctance electrical machines.

## Abstract
A drive system includes a reluctance motor 23 , driving a load 24 . The motor 23 has stator and rotor poles and magnetising windings for each stator pole. The airgap is small so that saturation occurs during pole overlap, and the poles are constructed so that there is torque overlap between phases as successive phases are energised during rotor rotation. A sensor 25 provides a rotor position input to a reference waveform generator 27 . The output of generator 27 is determined by rotor position and is applied to a power converter 29 through a current controller 28 . Accordingly the waveform generator establishes a relative magnitude for motor phase current for every position of the rotor during the period of energisatin of a motor phase. A further input may be applied to the system to determine the absolute magni tude of the phase current, subject to the waveform pattern established by generator 27 . The rotor poles may be skewed to modify the static torque versus rotor angle charcteristic of the motor, the skew being between one quarter and one half of rotor pole arcuate extent.
