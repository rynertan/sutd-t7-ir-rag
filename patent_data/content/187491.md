# Corrosion resistant silver mirror.

## Abstract
Durable, specularly reflective mirrors for solar reflectors or fluorescent lamp fixtures are formed by vapor depositing silver on a polyester film and protectively covering it with a coating of transparent acrylate polymer containing a silver corrosion inhibitor such as glycol dimercaptoacetate. In a preferred embodiment a pressure sensitive mounting adhe sive is applied to the opposite face of the polyester film. Degradation of the polyester, and consequent bubbling of the adhesive, is reduced or eliminated by incorporating UV absorber in acrylate polymer that is applied as a second protective coating.
