# A novel catalyst and reactions employing same.

## Abstract
A novel catalyst comprises i an organophosphorus containing compound, ii a compound, which is reactable in the Michael reaction, and contains both a a double or triple bond and b an electron withdrawing group and iii an alcohol or a mixture of an alcohol and a solvent. The novel catalyst may be generated from a novel catalyst precursor. The catalyst may be used to transesterify carboxylic or car bonic acid esters, to produce formate esters from alcohols and carbon monoxide and to produce formamides from amines and carbon monoxide.
