# Optical fiber connector.

## Abstract
A connector for a pair of optical fibers 10 each having a fiber or core 11 and a protective covering 12 thereover, said pair of optical fibers each having an end portion extent of the protective covering removed and the fiber end faced off to provide for abutting communication characterised by a contact 14 for each of the glass fibers including, three elongated members 18 each having an elongated cylindrical portion 19 and an end portion 20 with securing means 21 thereon, said members being so dimensioned as to enable forming an assembly about the glass fiber of the three members with the cylindrical portions contacting the bare glass core periphery and the securing means contacting the fiber protective covering, means 22, 28 for holding the three elongated members with their cylindrical portions arranged in mutual contacting relation and extending outwardly of the said means and an alignment means 16 for receiving the three elongated members assemblies from the pair of contacts and locating the outer ends of the two assemblies with the faced off ends of the fibers 11 at a predetermined spacing.
