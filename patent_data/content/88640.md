# VESSEL WITH EXHAUST THROUGH BOTTOM

## Abstract
A high speed vessel, the main exhaust b of which opens through the bottom, comprises a duct 12 leading forward from the exhaust opening to enable exhaust gases quickly to fill a recess 2 to provide lift and lower water resistance. The recess 2 is divided into a shallow portion 2₁ and a deep portion 2₂ . A groove 14 is provided around the periphery of the vessel s bot tom to trap exhaust gases. A triangular water flow guide 20 of trapezium like vertical section is positioned forward of a pro peller to divert the flow of aerated water which would other wise lead to a reduction in the propeller s efficiency.
