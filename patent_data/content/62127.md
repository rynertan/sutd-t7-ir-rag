# Deactivation of catalyst in solution process for polymerization of alpha olefins.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a solution polymeriza tion process for the preparation of high molecular weight polymers of α olefins selected from the group consisting of homopolymers of ethylene and copolymers of ethylene and C₃ C₁₂ α olefins. The process comprises feeding monomer, coordination catalyst and inert hydrocarbon solvent to a reactor, polymerizing the monomer at a temperature in the range of, in particular, 105 320 C and a pressure of less than 24 MPa and deactivatlng the catalyst in the solution so obtained by admixing therewith a solution of a salt of an alkaline earth metal or zinc and an aliphatic monocarboxylic acid dissolved in hydrocarbon solvent. The hydrocarbon solvent is then separated from the resultant solution and a composition comprising high molecular weight polymer is recovered. Any catalyst residues remain with the polymer. In a preferred embodiment the catalyst contains vanadium. A particular salt is the salt of a C₆ aliphatic acid, especially calcium 2 ethyl hexanoate.
