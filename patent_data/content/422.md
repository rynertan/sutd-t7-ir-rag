# Cathode ray tube using a screen comprising an electro optical substance.

## Abstract
An optical screen 12 is provided which can be used in conjunction with a cathode ray tube CRT 10 to prevent the CRT display from becoming unreadable in high ambient light conditions such as can occur in an aircraft cockpit . The screen includes a series of parallel strips 13 each of which includes a layer 18 of an electro optical substance such that it can be made light absorbent or transparent by varying voltage applied to the strip. In use Figure 1 the screen is positioned in front of a display face 11 of a CRT with the strips aligned with the writing direction of a raster 14 . The position of the raster controls 15, 16, 17 voltages applied to the strips to ensure that each strip is transparent when the raster is writing behind it. The electro optical substance is advantageously a liquid crystal material.
