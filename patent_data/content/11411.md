# Thermal energy storage material and a heat exchange device containing this material.

## Abstract
The thermal energy storage material comprises at least one hydrated compound such as an inorganic salt having a transition temperature to the anhydrous or a less hydrated form in the range 10 to 100 C and a hydrogel, comprising a water swollen cross linked polymerformed by cross linking a synthetic hydrophilic polymer by a covalent cross linking mechanism, throughout which the compound is dispersed. The hydrogel is made by reacting a water soluble or water dispersible synthetic hydrophilic polymer, which is preferably linear and thermoplastic, with a cross linking agent therefor in an aqueous medium containing the hydrated compound. The hydrophilic polymer, the aqueous medium and the hydrated compound are used in such amounts that the storage material contains a major proportion, by weight, of the hydrated com pound and a minor proportion, by weight, of the cross linked polymer.
