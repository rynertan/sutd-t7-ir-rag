# Apparatus for container handling.

## Abstract
An apparatus according to the invention for lifting containers of the standing type having connecting boxes 1a at least at the lower ends of its vertical corners, said apparatus comprising at least four separate hydraulic lifting devices 6, 7 which are jointly connectible to a hydraulic pump each of said lifting devices comprises a piston and cylinder releasably connectible to one of the four container corner end boxes to permit lifting of the container when the piston rod 7 serving as a supporting leg is standing on the ground said lifting device being connectible to said contain er via an intermediate member 31 included in a connecting device which comprises releasable clamping means 32, 37 for releasably clamping the intermediate member to the lifting cylinder 6 and to the lower container corner end box 1a , and lockable hinge means 39 permitting said in termediate member 31 and thereby said lifting device 6, 7 , to be pivoted through an angle of 180 , when the lifting device is connected to the container, the piston is retracted and the container is supported on the vehicle, from an operative to a rest position, and vice versa, and said connecting device, when the container is supported on said vehicle, being disconnectible from said container, whereby said lifting device in its rest position is pivoted to a position on the vehicle platform and, when disconnected, can be removed from the container to be stowed in an appropriate space on the vehicle.
