# Crimping tool.

## Abstract
A crimping tool intended, for example, for crimping contact sleeves onto electrically conductors includes at least three crimping jaws 24 guided for displacement in a tool body 10 . The jaws 24 present first, second and third straight jaw surfaces 25,26,28 , wherewith the first jaw surfaces 25 together define a crimping opening 27 . The first jaw surface 25 on each jaw 24 is constantly in slidable abutment with the second jaw surface 26 of an adjacent jaw 24 . The third jaw surfaces 28 abut against and are movable along a respective straight guide surface 31 formed in the tool body 10 . These guide surfaces 31 or extensions thereof define, when projected onto a plane extending at right angles to all guide surfaces 31 , a polygon having the same number of sides as there are jaws 24 present. The first, second and third jaw surfaces 25,26,28 of each jaw 24 or their extensions define a triangle, when projected onto said plane. The guide surfaces 31 are so directed that a corner of each jaw, defined by the first and second jaw surfaces 25,26 thereof, upon movement of the third jaw surface of the jaw along an associated guide surface 31 moves along a plane 33 which extends parallel with the guide surface and falls at right angles to the plane of the polygon and passes through the geometric centre of gravity thereof.
