## Description
DESC1PTION IMPROVED POLISH COMPOSITION The present invention relates to improved polishing compositions wherein the amount of silicon derived compound required therein to provide a given gloss and uniformity is decreased by the use of a specific aluminosilicate therewith. The instant invention relates to improved polish compositions which employ smaller amounts of the costly silicon compounds normally found in said polishes while having properties characteristic of polish compositions containing greater amounts of said silicon compounds It is well known in the art to provide polish compositions containing wax and or silicon compounds therein. In recent years the development in the area of polish compositions has in large part been directed to the development of detergent resistant polishes and for this purpose a vast number of silicon based compositions nave been developed. For example, see Uses. Patent Nos.3,544,498 3,668,229 3,576,779 3,814,710 4,218,240 3,856,533. Essential features of such polishes are derived from. the use of the wax and or a silicon derived component. These components provide important properties and functions to the polish composition. Such properties include the appearance gloss of the polished article, durability of the polished surface to water and detergent, and uniformity, that is, the evenness of the application of the polish composition to the article being treated. In view of tne desirability that such properties be provided by any commercial polish composition, it is necessary to add wax and or silicon based compositions to such polish compositions in order that these properties be provided by said compositions.Unfortunately, many of these wax and or silicon Dased compositions are extremely expensive and as a result the overall cost of the polish composition is greatly increased by their use. Traditionally, the formulation of polish compositions has been more or less static with respect to the ingredients which are routinely added to provide the final polish composition. Certain well known components are considered to be routine additives to such polish compositions, including the addition of abrasives waxes thickeners stabilizers and conventional silicone fluids. The inclusion of one or more of these components has generally been considered to be merely one of formulation and not intimately related to the specific characteristics of a given polish composition component as it is related to other components in the polish composition. The use of abrasives in polish compositions 1S well known in the art as demonstrated by the above referred to U.S. patents. These patents disclose that the abrasive material may be most any of the heretofore disclosed abrasive materials including diatomaceous earths, Newberg chalk, amorphous silica and aluminum silicates. For example, U.S. Patent No. 3,544,498 discloses a detergent resistant silicone polish wherein an organopolysiloxane copolymer is provided as the silicon based composition in a detergent resistant polish.The polish composition is disclosed as being capable of preparation with an abrasive conventionally employed in polish compositions, the most common of which are disclosed as being diatomaceous, aluminum silicate, and aluminum oxide such as hydrated alumina. n Further, the preferred abrasive is disclosed as a mixture of amorphous silica, aluminum silicate, and kaolin clay. This abrasive mixture is stated as providing a gloss, emulsion stability and detergent resistance for the polish which is superior to other abrasives. Tne aluminum silicate is present in an amount of 35 by weight of the total weight of the abrasive. In the examples an aluminum silicate is disclosed as being equatable with a diatomaceous earth or, for tnat matter, with the use of no abrasive at all. Thus, what is clear from a consideration of the examples of U.S.Patent No. 3,544,498 is that use of the aluminum silicate was deemed to provide no advantage over a diatomaceous earth or a kaolin clay from the standpoint of formulation of the polish composition as to the relative amounts of the expensive wax and or silicon based compositions employed therein. The use of Zeolite 4A in a polishing composition formed with a specific class of amides zits s disclosed in Japanese Application No. 95,846 79, filed July 27, 1979 published on February 27, 1979. Conventional components for polish compositions are disclosed as being optionally present in the amide based composition, including silicone oils waxes and solvents. It is clear that the relationship of the abrasive material is not deemed to have any effect on the amount of any component of the polish composition. The instant invention is distinguished from the previous attempts to provide polish compositions by the use of specific aluminosilicates as the abrasive material wherein the aluminosilicate is selected from the class consisting of Zeolite A,Zeolite X, Zeolite and mixtures thereof whereby the amount of said silicon derived compound required in the polish composition to provide a given gloss may be decreased as compared to conventional abrasive materials. The instant invention relates to polish compositions wherein the amount of the expensive silicon derived compound s is substantially reduced with respect to the amount heretofore required when employed witn coventional abrasives to provide a polish composition that provides an acceptable gloss and uniformity. This is accomplished by employing as the abrasive material an aluminosilicate selected from the class consisting of Zeolite A, Zeolite X, Zeolite Y and mixtures thereof. The instant invention relates to polish compositions wherein the amount of the silicon derived compound employed therein may be substantially reduced as compared with polish compositions provided neretofore. This reduction in the amount of the silicon derived compound is effected by employing as the abrasive component of the polish composition a crystalline aluminosilicate selected from class consisting of Zeolite A, ZeoliteX, Zeolite Y and mixtures thereof.Further, the selection of the crystalline aluminosilicate is preferably correlated to the selection of the silicon derived compound such that the effective amount of the silicon deriveo compound is the minimum effective amount required and is less than the amount required wnen conventional abrasives are employed e.g., a diatomite or a kaolin as the abrasive material in said polish composition, while the gloss and uniformity provided by the polish composition are maintained. It has been found that by the use of Zeolite A, Zeolite X, Zeolite Y and mixtures thereof as the abrasive in conjunction with silicon derived compounds that the amount of silicon derived compound employed may be substantially reduced. Further, it has been found that by correlating the selection of the aluminosilicate abrasive to the selection of the silicon derived compound to be employed therewith that the overall amount of said silicon derived compound employed therein may be substantially minimized. The chemical and physical properties of Zeolites A, X and Y are setforth in Zeolite Molecular Sieves, by Donald W. Breck, Wiley Interscience Publication 1974 , at pages 83 to 107, 134, 176 and 177, said pages being incorporated herein be reference thereto In particular, it has been observed that aluminosilicates which are especially well suited for use in such polish compositions are Zeolites 13X and 4A. The exact characteristics of a given aluminosilicate which provide for the decrease in the amount of the silicon derived compound in the polish compositions of this invention, e.g., as compared with that amount required when a diatomite or kaolin are used, are not completely understood.It is believed that a relationship between the hydrophillic nature of certain aluminosilicates and their pore size in relation to the selected silicon derived compound is, at least in part, responsible for the significant decrease in the amount of the silicon derived compound required in the polish compositions. Further, an aluminosilicate having a hydrophillicity, i.e., a selectivity or capacity for water greater than 10 weight percent for an anhydrous aluminosilicate and preferably at least as great as that possessed by zeolite 4A is believed generally employable herein as the aluminosilicate. Zeolites 4A and 13X are particularly preterred as the abrasives employable herein.Further, such aluminosilicates are believed to provide a necessary balance between the amount of silicon derived compound adsorbed by the abrasive component and that which is not absorbed, i.e., that which is present in the bulk polish composition. Although the exact nature of the aluminosilicate is not clearly understood in terms of all the physical and chemical characteristics which p provide for the resulting decrease in the amount of the silicon rlerived compound required, it is believed that the aXuminosilicate should be selected such that the nominal pore diameter is less than the average kinetic diameter of the silicon derived compound. Aluminosilicates which are believed to be particularly well suited for use in the instant invention are those aluminosilicates characterized as havinq a nominal pore diameter of about 7.5 Anqstroms or less. The polish compositions of this invention may contain as components the conventionally employed components including waxes thickeners emulsifiers stabilizers and the like. Any of the waxes employed heretotore in polish compositions may be employed herein, including vegetable waxes such a carnuba, bayberry, and sugar cane, candellilla and ouricury animal waxes such as beeswax mineral waxes such as ozacerite, ceresin, and montan and synthetic waxes such as ozoerite, polyetnylene waxes and paraffin waxes including microcrystalline and oxidized paraffins, hydrogenated castor oil, polyolether esters, chlorinated naphthalenes, etc. The wax is generally present in the polish composition in an amount between 0 and about 20 by weight based on the weight of the polish composition, and preferably between about 1 and about 108 by weight. The silicon derived compound employed in the polish compositions herein can be any of the silicon derived compounds routinely employed in such polish compositions. These include derivatized silicone oils sucn as dialkylsilicones e.g., dimethylsilicone the aminofunctional silicone fluids, such as described in U.S. Patent No. 3,960,575, at column 2 line 36 to column 4 line 1, which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference thereto and the silicon compounds disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,576,779, at column 1 line 62 to column 2 line 33, which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference thereto U.S. Patent No. 3,814,710, at column 2 line 18 to column 3 line 14, said disclosure being incorporated herein by reference thereto U.S. Patent No. 3,668,229, at column 1 line 40 to column 5 line 43, said disclosure being incorporated herein by reference thereto U.S. Patent No. 3,856,533, at column 2 line 3 to column 2 line 28, said disclosure being incorporated herein by reference thereto. Representative of other silicon derived compounds employable herein are those disclosed in the following U.S. Patents, said patents being incorporated herein by reference thereto 2,832,754 aminopropylpolysiloxane 2,930,809 aminoalkylsilicon compounds 3,341,486 organopolysiloxanes 3,355,424 aminoalkylsiloxanes 3,544,498 organopolysiloxane copolymers 3,890,271 hydroxyl endblocked polydimethylsiloxane and 4,246,029 aminofunctional silicone fluid and an organopolysiloxane fluid , just name a few. The silicon derived compound may be employed in an effective amount to provide a polish composition having a given gloss. The amount employed is the effective amount that provides a given gloss with the aluminosilicate and is preferably the minimum effective amount as determined by correlation of the aluminosilicate and the silicon derived compound. The effective amount is generally an amount between about 0.1 and about 10 by weight, based on the weight of the total polish composition, and is more preferably employed in an amount between about 0.1 and about 6 by weight with amounts between about 0.1 and about 2 by weight being most preferred.Generally, the amount of silicon derived compound may be reduced to less than about 50 percent by weight or the amount required when using comparably sized diatomites or kaolins while the gloss and uniformity of the polish composition are retained. The aluminosilicate abrasive Zeolite A, X, Y and mixtures thereof is generally employed in the polish composition in an amount between about 0.1 percent and about 30 percent by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, and more preferably between about 0.5 and about 20 percent by weight and most preferably between about 1 and about 10 percent. Representative or the advantage derived from the correlation of the aluminosilicates and silicon derived compounds in such polish compositions is shown by reference to Tables I andII, set forth hereinafter, wherein the relative amounts given as a weight percent of total composition of the silicon derived components are set forth for an emulsified polish composition and a solvent based composition for polish compositions employing aluminosilicates and polish compositions wherein such are not employed.

Super Floss 2 wt. 8 Zeolite 4A S Kerosene 3 3Mineral Spirits 69 74 As is clear from a consideration of TablesI and II above, the amount ot the silicon derived compound employed in the polish compositions of this invention is substantially less tnan that employed in polish compositions containing a diatomite as the abrasive.While the polish compositions of the invention employ lesser amounts of the silicon derived compounds tney retain their excellent gloss and their uniformity as determined by ASTM metnod number D 3836 79, which method is incorporated herein by reterence thereto. Although the use of a lower amount of said silicon derived compounds may in part be related to the absorption capacity of a given abrasive, it is believed tnat factors other than just the absorption capacity of a given abrasive are involved in the ability of certain aluminosilicates to provide polish compositions wherein such a lower amount of the silicon derived compound may be employed.It is believed that the external surface area of the aluminosilicate and the low organophillic character of the surface may, at least in part, account for the unique behavior of these materials when employed as abrasives in polish compositions containing silicon derived compounds. It is also believed that the total water capacity of a particular aluminosilicate and the affinity of the aluminosilicate for such water may be involved in the advantages derived from such aluminosilicates in the instant polish compositions. The following examples are provided to further characterize the invention and are not, in any way, meant to be limiting thereof EXAMPLE 1 Polish compositions A and B, containing silicone oil, were prepared with identical formulations except that in Polish A the abrasive was a diatomaceous earth and in Polish B the abrasive was Zeolite 4A. The polish compositions were applied on painted automotive surfaces and removed. Polish B was observed to provide the surface with excess oil as demonstrated by residual oil after wiping smearing while Polish A did not provide the painted surface with such residual oil. The presence of excess residual oil indicates that Polish B contained an excess of the silicon oil over that required to form the polish composition while Polish A does not contain such an excess. EXAMPLE 2 The reduction in the amount of the silicon derived compound which is needed to provide a polish composition with a given gloss and uniformity was tested by preparing several polish compositions which were identical, except that Polish C contained Snow Floss Snow Floss is the Trademark of Johns Manville Celite Division tor a milled sized diatomaceous silica as. the brv3ivew Polish E contained Kaopolite SF Kaopolite is theTrademark of Kaopolite Inc., Garwood, N.J., for an anhydrous aluminum silicate Raolin as the abrasive, and Polish D, prepared in accordance with this invention, contained Zeolite 13X as the abrasive.The amount of silicon derived compound in each Polish was decreased until no smearing was observed an indication that no excess silicon derived compound was being employed in the polish composition . Polishes C, D and E were prepared by forming three mixtures I, II and III as follows, with all amounts given as weight percents or the total composition MIXTURE I AMOUNT Dimethylsilicone as set forth hereinafter 1000 centistokes 5 centistokes Olecic acia 2.5 Kerosene 2.0 Mineral Spirits 18 Amylacetate 0.2 MIXTURE II Morpholine 1.5 Water 16.0 MIXTURE III Abrasive 14.0 Phenol 0.1 CARBOPOL 934 0.2 Water Balance CARBOPOL 934 is a Trademark of B.F.

Polish C, prepared by using Snow Floss as the abrasive, was prepared with 6 weight percent dimethylsilicone and no smearing was observed as determined in accordance with ASTM D 3836. The smearing of Polishes D and E were compared by preparing several polishes D l, D 2, etc and E l, E 2, etc with varying amounts of dimethylsilicone, as follows Dimethyl Polish Composition silicone D 1 D 2 D 3 D 4 D 5 E l E 2 E 3 1000 centi stokes 5.0 2.5 1.5 0.8 0.5 5.0 2.5 1.5 5 centistokes 1.0 0.5 0.5 0.2 0.1 1.0 0.5 0.5 These polishes were observed to provide comparable uniformity.The polishes were then compared for smearing according to ASTM D 3836 and the following results observed Polish Smearing1 D l Significant D 2 Significant D 3 Slight D 4 Slight D 5 Slight E l Significant E 2 Slight E 3 None 1 Significant 7 Slight 2 None Polishes D 1, D 2, D 3, D 4 and E 2 were compared for gloss by using C.S.M.A. approved test panels finished with black automotive paint using a Gardner gloss meter 600C that has been standardized and a base point gloss measurement made on the unpolished 12 x 18 panel. The gloss was measured with measurements of 90 being excellent 70 90 good 50 70 fair and less than 50 being considered poor. Polishes D 2, D 3 and E 2 were both found to have excellent gloss and polishes D l and D 4 were found to have good gloss about 90.0 for both D l and D 4 . Some fine scratches were observed on the test panels wherein polishes D 1,D 2, D 3, D 4 and D 5 had been employed.
