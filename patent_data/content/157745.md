# Temperature control arrangement for heating systems.

## Abstract
In a central heating system, the temperature tw of the heating fluid is controlled depending on the outdoor tem perature tu and the indoor temperature ti . A non linear operating graph presenting the relation between the outdoor temperature tu and the heating fluid temperature tw is approximated by a sequence of linear sections a, b, c, d of different steepness, the location of the transit points between the sections being determined by the difference between the desired reference temperature to and the sensed indoor temperature ti . Thus, the system optimizes the heating curve in a self adaptive way.
