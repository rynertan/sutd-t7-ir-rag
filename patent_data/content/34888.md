# An edge connection arrangement for connecting premanufactured duct sections and or equipment cabinets.

## Abstract
Premanufactured duct sections and or equipment cabinets for use, for example, in a central unit of an air condi tioning system are assembled in extension of each other by means of an edge connection arrangement comprising U shaped lip members 6 with outwardly facing, relatively narrow openings on each of the opposing end edges of two neighbouring sections or cabinets, and a clamping strip member 7 engaging said lip members 6 , and having a T shaped cross section in which the legs are constituted by two mainly parallel resilient tongues 8, 9 for introduction in the respective U shaped lip members 6 transversely to the longitudinal direction thereof. Between the lip members 6 connected in this manner and, thus, between the sections and or cabinets, a firm engagement with good strength and sealing properties is obtained without any need for separate sealing strips. In the finished joint, only the double walled central part 10 of the clamping strip member 7 extends outside the flat sidewalls of the sections or cabinets.

## Description
An edge connection arrangement for connecting premanufactured duct sections and or equipment cabinets. This invention relates to an edge connection arrangement for connecting premanufactured duct sections and or equipment cabinets having a uniform, mainly polygonal cross section in extension of each other, particularly for use in air conditioning systems, comprising U shaped lip members each having an outwardly facing, relatively narrow opening on the opposing end edges of the side walls of adjacent sections or cabinets, and a clamping strip member having two substantially parallel legs for introduction into the opening of each of a pair of adjoining lip members. It is known to use edge connection arrangements of this kind in the assembling of minor plate sections into greater side walls of ventilation ducts or equipment cabinets, as well as assembling of finished duct sections or equipment cabinets in extension of each other in joints extending in a plane perpendicular to the axial direction. In most prior art edge connection arrangements, use is made of a connection strip in the form of a sliding strip member which is pushed along lip or flange members at the adjoining edges from the ends thereof, so that arrangement of the sliding strip member requires an external space corresponding to the complete length of the joint. Edge connection arrangements of this kind are known, inter alia, from Danish patent specificationsNos. 111,548 and 114,106, as well as the specification of published Danish patent application No. 3894 68. From British patent specification No. 1,287,676 andDanish patent specification No. 130,198, edge connection arrangements are known, however, in which this disadvantage has been avoided by use of a connecting member constituted by a clamping strip member, which is pressed onto the lip or flange members transversely to the longitudinal direction thereof.These prior art solutions have in common that they require the use of a rubber elastic sealing strip, the correct arrangement of which between the adjoining flange members will either require the use of a special tool, which is drawn longitudinally through the resilient clamping strip member before arrangement thereof, or require the use of a sealing strip having a special H shaped cross section, the correct arrangement of which between the adjoining flange members before arrangement of the clamping strip member is a relatively time consuming operation. Whether sliding or clamping strip members are used as connection members, the prior art connection arrangements have in common that they usually require the use of a sealing strip of rubber elastic material, for enple, and that the flange members project as a relatively wide bead on the external sides of the duct sections and or equipment cabinets, so as to interrupt the otherwise flat character of the side walls thereof. From British patent specification No. 1,116,700, an edge connection arrangement is known, which is intended for double plate wall sections having intermediate insulation and intended for arrangement in planar extension of each other, in which the use of special sealing strips is avoided by arranging U shaped lip members on the opposing edges of the wall sections at both plate sides and connecting these lip members, which are constructed to be resilient by means of clamping strip members which are also U shaped in cross section. Thus, since this prior art edge connection arrangement requires clamping strip members to be arranged on both sides of the wall sections, it is only suitable for in situ assembling of plate shaped sections into side walls of an equipment cabinet or chamber, which in accordance with the British patent specification must be supported on a supporting structure by means of U shaped rails formed particularly for this purpose. It is the object of the invention to provide an edge connection arrangement of the kind mentioned for connecting premanufactured duct sections and or equipment cabinets for assembling such sections or cabinets, for example, into a central unit for an air conditioning system, whereby the sections or cabinets in question may be embodied as frame structures having single plate side walls and, possibly, insulating material on the interior sides thereof and, in which, by means of the same edge connection arrangement along the connecting joints on all sides of the polygonal sections, excellent strength properties of the joint and, in most applications, a sufficiently tight joint are obtained simultaneously and without the use of any additional sealing strip. According to the invention, this is obtained by means of an edge connection arrangement which is characterized in that said clamping strip member has a substantially T shaped cross section with legs being bent to extend substantially perpendicularly relative to a double walled central part, which is formed to engage edge regions of said side walls, said legs being formed as resilient tongues biased away from each other. By forming the clamping strip member as a T shaped profile, the central part of which engages edge regions of the external sides of the adjacent side walls of two adjoining sections, and the legs of which are formed as resilient tongues, a very strong joint is obtained by arranging such clamping strip members on the external sides of the sections solely. No other connecting means are required between the sections, and neither is any common support structure required, as a result of which premanufactured sections and equipment cabinets may be assembled to a complete unit ready for installation and provided with simple supporting legs, such as a central unit for an air conditioning system comprising cabinets accommodating one or more fans with associated humidifi cationtheating, filtering and damping means. The invention opens the possibility of manufacturing a varied program of duct sections or cabinets for equipment in the production stage as individual premanufactured complete components having a suitable size with respect to transportation and manipulation, supplying a number of such components corresponding to the actual demand and final in situ assembling into a unit ready for installation with a minimum of mounting work. In the completed joint, only the flat central portion of the T shaped clamping strip member will be visible from the outside. Even without the use of a sealing strip, there will be substantially no possibility for air passage through the joint, since, on one hand, the mutually engaging parts of the lip members of the two duct sections when connected in this way will be pressed into firm engagement with one another by the resilient tongues of the clamping strip member and, on the other hand, the double side walls of the central portion will be compressed opposite the resilient tongues, whereby the longitudinal external edges of the central portion will be pressed into engagement with the side walls of the sections. A particularly tight sealing between the lip members is obtained by forming each of the resilient tongues of the clamping strip member with a free edge portion which is bent away from the other resilient tongue. A clamping strip member of this embodiment may be manufactured from relatively thin sheet material, if a reinforcing strip is introduced in the double walled central part. In the following, the invention will be explained in further detail with reference to the schematical drawings, in which Fig. 1 illustrates the use of an edge connection arrangement according to the invention for assembling two equipment cabinets in extension of each other, Figs. 2 and 3 show a preferred embodiment of the clamping strip member and the lip members of the edge connection arrangement, Fig. 4 shows an edge connection arrangement with a clamping strip member and lip members as shown in Figs.2 and 3 in mutual engagement, and Fig. 5 shows a modification of the clamping strip member. Fig. 1 is a perspective view of two equipment cabinets 1 and 2 incorporated as parts of a central unit in an air conditioning system and accommodating, for an ple, one or more fans with associated air conditioning equipment in the form of filters, humidifiers and or heating members, as well as control dampers. The cabinets 1 and 2, which are shown in a slightly exploded condition in the figure, are to be assembled in extension of each other by means of an edge connection arrangement according to the invention along joints 3, 4 extending in a plane perpendicular to the axial direction of the central unit, which in this case has a rectangular cross section. In the preferred embodiment of the edge connection arrangement, separate edge strip members 5 are arranged along each of the opposing end edges of the side walls of the two cabinets 1 and 2, said edge strip members being provided with U shaped lip members 6 having outwardly facing relatively narrow openings, and a substantiallyT shaped clamping strip member 7 is used for connecting the two edge strip members 5 with the lip members 6 engaging each other, said clamping strip member having two resilient tongues 8 and 9, which are introduced into the outwardly facing openings of the respective lip members 6 when the clamping strip member 7 is positioned transversely to the longitudinal direction of the lip members 6 and interlock said lip members in a safe and tight mutual engagement. As shown in Fig. 2, the clamping strip member 7 may be formed by longitudinal bending of a strip shaped member with the two resilient tongues 8 and 9 bent substan tially perpendicularly relative to a double walled central part 10 having walls lOa and lOb. With the two resilient tongues 8 and 9 biased away from each other, a strong spring action is obtained with this construction to secure a tight interlocking mutual engagement of the lip members. Each of the resilient tongues 8 and 9 has a free edge part 8a and 9a, respectively, which is bent off from the part 8b and 9b, respectively, of the tongue extending substantially perpendicularly relative to the central part 10 away from the other resilient tongue 9 or 8, respectively. As shown in detail in Fig. 3, the U shaped lip members 6 are formed with two substantially parallel legs 6a and 6b, the separation of which matches the width of the resilient tongues 8 and 9, so that the width of theU shaped opening between the legs 6a and 6b is somewhat smaller than the width of the free edge part 8a, 9a of each resilient tongue 8, 9 perpendicular to the part 8b, 9b extending perpendicular to the central part 10. In the embodiment shown in Fig. 3, the leg 6b of each lip member 6 intended for engagement with an opposing lip member is somewhat shorter than the leg 6a facing the duct section or cabinet with the height of the leg 6b exceeding, however, the height of the free edge part 8a and 9a, respectively, of the corresponding resilient tongue of the clamping strip member 7. By this construction, it is secured that the longitudinal external edges of the central part 10 of the clamping strip member 7 are brought into tight engagement against the upper side of the edge strip members 5, as shown in Fig. 4. As shown in Fig. 4, the spring action of the clamping strip member 7 and the dimension thereof relative to the lip members 6 will result in slight straightening of the free edge parts 8a and 9a, respectively, of the resilient tongues 8 and 9, whereby the spring forces in the tongues 8 and 9 will attempt to press the legs 6a and 6b of each lip member away from each other, so that the legs 6b of the lip members engaging each other will be pressed into a safe and tight engagement, so that substantially no possibility will exist for any air passage through the edge connection arrangement. TMen assembling the cabinets 1 and 2 as shown inFig. 1, the clamping strip members 7 are positioned by hammering after alignment of the cabinets 1 and 2 accommodating, for example, the aforementioned equipment, with the lip members 6 of the edge strip members 5 in mutual engagement, so that arrangement of the member takes place transversely to the longitudinal direction of the assembled unit. After arrangement, only the flat central parts 10 of the clamping strip members 7 will extend outside the flat side walls of the sections or cabinets. Even if the lip member 6 in the embodiment shown is formed by separate edge strip members 5 having a substantially L shaped cross section as shown in Figs. 3 and 4, one leg of which forms the lip member 6, whereas the other leg 5a serves for securing the edge strip member 5 relative to a side wall of a section or a cabinet by spot welding, for example, the lip members may alternatively be formed integrally with the side. walls by bending of edge regions thereof. In cases where a further improved safety against air passage is desired beyond the normal good sealing obtained by an edge connection arrangement according to the invention, a separate sealing strip 11 may, as shown inFig. 4, be positioned below the bottom of each of theU shaped lip members 6 in engagement, for example, with a shoulder part 12 below the lip member 6. Such sealing strips 11 must have a somewhat greater width than the lip members 6. In the modification shown in Fig. 5, a flat reinforcing strip 13 is introduced into the double walled central part 10 of the T shaped clamping strip member 7 .Thereby the clamping strip member may as a whole be manufactured with sufficient strength from a relatively thin sheet material.
