# SEMICONDUCTOR PACKAGE

## Abstract
An embodiment of the present invention relates to a plastic encapsulated semiconductor device having a lead frame with a plurality of leads, a silicon chip having at least one contact pad supported thereon, and a wire having one end ball bonded to the pad and the other end bonded to one lead. The lead frame, wire and contact pad are all composed of the same metal or an alloy of that same metal. Preferably, the lead frame, wire and contact pad contain a major amount of aluminum. While electrolyte is present in the plastic encapsulation, the formation of electrochemical cells is inhibited since no diverse metals are present. Accordingly, galvanic corrosion is inhibited.
