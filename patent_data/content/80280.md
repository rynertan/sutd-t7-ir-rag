# A synchronous video detector circuit using phase locked loop.

## Abstract
In a synchronous video detector circuit using a phase locked loop PLL 13, 14, 15, 16 , the synchronous detection of a video IF signal is effected with a synchronous carrier signal reproduced by the PLL including a voltage controlled oscillator 15 . Each of a phase comparator 13 of the PLL and a synchronous video detector 18 has its input terminal connected to an output terminal of a video IF amplifier 11 by untuned coupling 17, 17 , and arranged on the output side of the synchronous video detector 18 is a phase locked mode detector 19 for detecting that the PLL is in its phase locked mode. The phase locked mode detector 19 is adapted to control the band width of a low pass filter 14 of the PLL in either a narrow band mode or a wide band mode and the low pass filter 14 is controlled to operate in the narrow band mode only when the PLL is in the phase locked mode of operation. The black and white noise included in the output signal of the synchronous video detector 18 are both cancelled by a noise cancellation circuit 20 including a black noise detector 21 for pulse noise calcellation purposes.
