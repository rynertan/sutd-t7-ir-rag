# Hydraulic mounting system for a power unit.

## Abstract
A mounting system for a vehicle engine 2,3 includes hydraulic mounting units 4 located at the opposite sides of an engine output shaft 2a . Each mounting unit 4 includes a hydraulic chamber 8 which is filled with hydraulic liquid and is bounded at its bottom by a resilient membrane 7 . The hydraulic chamber of one unit is connected with that of the other unit through a conduit 10 which is provided with an orifice 15 . In operation, vertical oscillations of the engine can take place only by slight distortions of rubber mounting members 6 , which are supported by the liquid in the chambers 8 , and which are thus restricted by the deflec tions of the membrane 7 . Therefore a relatively hard support is provided. Under rolling movement of the engine 2 on the other hand, very much softer support is provided because the movement of liquid from one chamber 8 to the other through the conduit 10 allows much greater move ments of the rubber mounting members to take place. The soft support against rolling movement enables torque variations in the engine to be isolated.
