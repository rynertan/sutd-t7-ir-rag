# Automatic stepless transmission.

## Abstract
The disclosure herein describes an automatic stepless transmission with a continuously changing gear ratio the transmission comprises two differential gear mechanisms 16,18 interconnected through a pair of gear connections 36 38 46 48 52 54 60 62 34 24 64 32 so that the power flow from the first differential gear mechanism 16 to the second differential gear mechanism 18 is divided into two components when the transmission is in gear .
