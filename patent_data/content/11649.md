# PADDING ALLOYS BASED ON NICKEL.

## Abstract
A padding alloy based on nickel comprising 0.05 1.5 by weight of boron, 3 7 by weight of silicon, 7.5 35 by weight of chromium, 0.05 1.5 by weight of carbon, if desired, with the addition of at most 30 by weight of iron or at most 5 by weight of tungsten or both, the remainder being substantially nickel, the weight ratio of said silicon to said boron being at least 3.3. This alloy is high in toughness and has no fear of cracks in padded layers, and further has high wear resistance and corrosion resistance. The corrosion resistance of this alloy may be remarkably improved by the addition of 0.1 3 by weight of tin or 0.1 3 by weight of tantalum or both. This alloy is adapted to be used for padding alloys for parts of various kinds of plants, machines or equipments.
