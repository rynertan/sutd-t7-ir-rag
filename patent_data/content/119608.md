# Coating composite for extended corrosion resistance.

## Abstract
A coating composite provides extended corrosion resist ance for substrate metals. The thin metallic undercoat of the composite contains combined metals. The heat curable and substantially resin free topcoat is established from composi tion containing chromium in non elemental form, which top coat composition may further contain particulate metal, all in li quid medium. In addition to outstanding corrosion resistance, the composite can retain substrate weldability as well as achieving formability, while further enhancing paintability and weatherability.
