## Description
This invention relates to the treatment of depression in vertebrates. Chem. Abs. WO A 8200250 discloses that depression in human patients can be alleviated by the administration of tyrosine and or phenylalanine, in order to regulate blood plasma levels of tyrosine or phenylalanine and thereby to form corresponding amounts of catecholamines released in synapses. The present invention, refers to the use of a an amino acid selected from L or D phenylalanine, L or D tyrosine and α keto and α hydroxy analogues thereof, acetyl L or D tyrosine, or a dipeptide or tripeptide form thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof, and b a manganese compound, for the preparation of a medicament for use in treating depression in vertebrates. Because of the cumulative nature of the medication, treatment should begin with small amounts and work up to maximum doses. Then, almost as quickly over a period of days, it may be necessary to decrease the dosage. The manganese may be considered to modulate the phenylalanine or other anti depressant amino acid in its action as a precursor for catecholamines. Depression is best evaluated by the clinician, in initial treatment. This is dictated by changes in dosage that sometime occur very quickly. The patient should be taken off all drugs when beginning treatment, since it is important that the clinician has an accurate picture of the patient, without masking by the effect of other drugs. The following Example illustrates the invention. History of recurrent attacks of depression. Periods of stress have contributed to recurrent episodes at rather long intervals of time. Treatment periods Circumstances prevented daily visits during one episode of depression. Another episode medication could be provided daily. Treatment Evaluation of emotional status. Dietary management for stabilization of blood sugar. Placed on combination of phenylalanine and manganese doses calculated in mg of manganese in manganese gluconate . Initial therapy with 3 to 4 mg of manganese. Phenylalanine begun with about ten to twenty mg. These were increased to about 4 to 8 mg of manganese and then decreased when this amount was no longer needed. The phenylalanine was increased to 25 to 50 mg. Its dosage was then given at less frequent intervals and in decreasing amounts. Treatment Period Interval Initially it varied from daily to every two or three days. After ten to fourteen days, every three or four days for a week or two more. This changed quickly to once a week, then every ten to fourteen days and then every three to four weeks. Dietary program became sufficient with intervals at one to two months. Objective of Treatment To restore emotional tone to normal range. Clinical Response Normal affect and emotional pattern with full work schedule within two to three weeks. Full normal pattern of response delayed to about six to eight weeks. Supportive treatment at intervals. Second episode Very little time for treatment. Followed as above about one week with same degree of improvement. Then, given about 8 to 12 mg of manganese as gluconate and 50 mg or more mg of phenylalanine at weekly or longer intervals. Rapid improvement. Continued full schedule of work. Ratios of medication B.W. 75 kg. Mn ranged from 0.040 mg to 0.106 mg per kg phenylalanine from 0.133 to 0.667 mg kg
