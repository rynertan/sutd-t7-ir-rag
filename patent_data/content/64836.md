# Valve train means in a reciprocating internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
In an engine valve train, each rocker arm 20 and its associate fulcrum 40 are provided with cooperating inner 41 and outer 25 cylindrical surface contours carrying the reaction forces of rocker arm, the ratio of the radius of the outer surface contour 25 to the radius of the inner surface contour 41 being approximately in the order of 3 1 to 1.7 1 and preferably 2 1, the rocker arm 20 and fulcrum 40 having a cooperating retainer recess 29 and pin 44, intermediate the ends of the associated bearing surface 25, 41, to maintain alignment of these elements in substantially rolling contact with each other during pivotable movement of the rocker arm 20. In the preferred embodiment the radii of curvature of these bearing surfaces 25, 41 are selected in the ratio of 2 1 so as to obtain rolling motion known as cardanic motion, the recess 29 being defined by opposed inclined flat surfaces and the contact surfaces of the pin 44 being of semi circular profile in substantial two point contact with the surface defined by the recess 29.
