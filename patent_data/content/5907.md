# Channel type tractor frame.

## Abstract
A vehicle frame having longitudinally spaced apart parallel tapered channel frame members 60, 64 extending forwardly from a unitized backhoe mounting rear frame section to a front yoke. The tapered channel frame members are narrow at the front yoke 72 and become wider toward the midsection of the frame. These frame members are at their widest just forward of a rear axle location 130 on the frame. A unitized backhoe mounting rear frame 60 section and a loader tower 166 locate the tapered channels relative to the longitudinal centre line of the frame.
