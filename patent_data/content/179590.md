# Phase control circuits for timebase correctors.

## Abstract
An automatic phase control apparatus for controlling the phase of a phase information signal used for producing an initial address, the initial address being used for writing into or for reading out from a memory circuit of a time base corrector for reducing a time base error included in a reproduced video signal, includes a phase shift circuit 31 for shifting the phase of a horizontal synchronizing pulse, a phase comparator 33 for comparing a phase between the phase shifted horizontal synchronizing pulse and a constant wave signal in phase with a chroma burst signal, and a feedback circuit 34, 42, 39 between the phase comparator 33 and the phase shift circuit 31 for applying a feedback signal in relation to an output signal of the phase comparator 33 to the phase shift circuit 31 so that the phase of the phase information pulse signal is synchronized with the constant wave signal. The feedback circuit 34, 42, 39 includes a capacitor 34 for holding the amplitude of the output signal of the phase comparator 33 , a display circuit 42 connected to the capacitor 34 for indicating the value of the output signal of the phase comparator 33 and a stabilizer circuit 39 connected between the capacitor 34 and a switching circuit 40 for stabilizing the feedback signal so that the value of the feedback signal is approximately zero voltage when the switching circuit 40 is operated.
