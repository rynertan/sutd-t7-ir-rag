# Process for preparing 1,1 dihalo 1,2,2,2, tetrafluoroethanes.

## Abstract
A process for preparing 1,1 dihalo 1,2,2,2 tetrafluoro ethanes by isomerization of 1,2 dihalotetrafluoroethanes at their reflux temperature, by using, as a catalyst, the reaction product prepared in situ from an anhydrous aluminium halide with at least equimolecular amounts of the isomer 1,1 dihalo 1,2,2,2 tetrafluoroethane in a medium consisting of 1,2 dihalotetrafluoroethane.
