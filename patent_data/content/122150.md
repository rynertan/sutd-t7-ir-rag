# Integral gas seal for fuel cell gas distribution assemblies and method of fabrication.

## Abstract
A porous gas distribution plate assembly for a fuel cell, such as a bipolar assembly, includes an inner impervious region wherein the bipolar assembly has good surface porosity but no through plane porosity and wherein electrical conductivity through the impervious region is maintained. A hot pressing process for forming the bipolar assembly includes placing a layer of thermoplastic sealant material between a pair of po rous, electrically conductive plates, applying pressure to the assembly at elevated temperature, and allowing the assembly to cool before removing the pressure whereby the layer of sealant material is melted and diffused into the porous plates to form an impervious bond along a common interfaces be tween the plates holding the porous plates together. The distri bution of sealant within the pores along the surface of the plates provides an effective barrier at their common interface against through plane transmission of gas.
