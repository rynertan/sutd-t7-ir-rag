## Description
A conveyable boot cradle.The invention relates to a conveyable boat cradle with a polygonal supporting frame comprising means for supporting the hull.Boat cradles of the abovedescribed type are generally known and are, for instance, disclosed in Netherlands Patent ApplicationNo. 79 03417, as filed on May 1, 1979 in the name of Applicant.When such known boat cradles are loaded, so when a boat has been placed upon them, they are no longer conveyable, which implies that the respective boat has to be conveyed towards the cradle and be placed thereupon in a known manner by means of a mobile crane or a mobile boat lift.Said conveyance of the boat towards the cradle is for the greater part the cause of the relatively high costs of a winter storage of boats ashore. Both a mobile boat lift and a mobile crane demand very high investments whereas they are only used intensively in the late and early season two wit on bringing a boat ashore and on relaunching the some. Both devices are only difficultly manoeuvrable so that bringing boats ashore and relaunching them is rather time consuming and demands the presence of at least three persons.In order to furthermore optimally use the space available for winter storage of boats, filling said space with boats will take place in the late season starting from one location for instance a corner of the field which is available, whereas in the early season said boats have to be relaunched in a reverse sequence this has the great disadvantage that the person whose boat has firstly been put ashore and placed in the winter storage space, is the last one to have his boat relaunched, The present invention aims to provide a cheap, structural uncomplicated conveyable boat cradle, which offers the possibility of accomodating the boats in the winter storage space in a quicker and cheaper manner obviously said cradle can also be used when a boat has to be overhauled or repaired, for which purpose it must be brought ashore.The boat cradle in accordance with the invention is for that aim characterized by a conveying frame to be located around said supporting frame and comprising roller means resting upon the bottom and lifting means acting in a vertical direction between said conveying frame on the one hand and said supporting frame on the other hand.Bringing ashore and launching of boats can now be accomplished by using an uncomplicated stationary crane upon a simple concrete base the boat cradle is brought within reach of said crane, whereupon the boat is placed upon the cradle.This does not require intricate or difficult manoeuvring with the crane and or the boat and does not take much time.By extending the lifting means the supporting frame is detached from the bottom whereafter said conveying frame can be towed away with the supporting frame either by manpower or with the aid of a simple tractor. When the assembly consisting of said conveying frame and supporting frame has arrived at the desired location, the lifting means are retracted so that the supporting frame with the boat comes to rest upon the bottom, whereupon the conveying frame can be removed for conveying another supporting frame.A simple and cheap embodiment according to the invention is obtained when the supporting frame is substantially trapezoidal while the conveying frame has a substantial U shape and possesses diverging longitudinal legs being adapted to the dimensions of the supporting frame. In this embodiment an accurate adaptation of the dimensions of the conveying frame to those of the supporting frame is not essential, as the longitudinal legs of the conveying frame, the supporting frame respectively, will automatically fit into each other when the convcyingframe is initially placed about the supporting frame from the smaller side of the latter.In a favourable embodiment of the invention the conveying frame comprises at least along two sides facing each other, a L shape profile beam open to the underside and outside which profile beam is provided with coupling members interacting with the supporting frame, with within said L profile beam a U shape profile beam, open to the underside and accomodating rollers, the lifting members being supported in the U profile beam and acting upon a transverse leg of the L beam thereabove.The two longitudinal legs of the supporting frame are for that aim preferably provided with an outwardly projecting supporting face, cooperating with a lifting surface being situated thereabove and being disposed on the inside of theL beam, which lifting surface projects towards the centre of the conveying frame.The lifting members preferably consist of pneumatically or hydraulically operating cylinders, which, having compact dimensions, still permit a substantial lifting capacity and which are fed with pressure fluid by means of a simple compressor, hydraulic pump respectively.In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the supporting face is constituted by a leg of a longitudinalU profile beam open to the outsider while the lifting surface is formed by the upper face of a profile beam section being provided on the inner side of the conveying frame.The displacement of the conveying frame is facilitated when the transverse beam of said frame carries at least one wheel which is rotatable about a vertical axle.Accomodating a boat can be effected simply with an easy adaption of the configuration of the supporting parts to the shape of the respective boat, when the uprights of the supporting frame are formed by telescoping tube sections, the lower end of the outermost one being accomodated in a guide member which is slideably enclosed in a frame beam being provided with a longitudinal slot. As soon as the uprights of the supporting frame are loaded by the weight of the boat, both the telescoping tube sections and the guide members will cant slightly, thus causing the various components to be automatically locked against any further displacement. Furthermore the two transverse sides are preferably interconnected by means of a longitudinal centre beam provided with a longitudinal slot and enclosing at least one guide member. Said longitudinal centre beam may comprise still further uprights with supporting heads, by means of which the keel and the lower part of the hull can be supported.The uprights can be easily detached from the guide members and the.now flat. supporting frames can be stacked so that they do not occupy much space.The invention will be illustrated, by way of example only, with the aid of the accompanying drawings, wherein Figure 1 is a perspective view of a supporting frame and of a matching conveying frame according to the invention Figure 2 is a perspective view of a supporting and a conveying frame with a boat disposed thereupon Figure 3 is half view, half cross section of profile beams used for the construction of the conveying frame, said figure likewise showing in which manner the guide members are guided in the supporting frame Figure 4 is a detail showing the manner in which the front wheels are supported in the conveying frame Figure 5 is a side view of said front wheel unit.The entire supporting frame is designated in figure 1 by the reference numeral la whilst the conveying frame of which the shape is adapted to the supporting frame which is to be used in combination therewith, is designated in said figure by the reference numeral tb. The supporting frame supports the boat 2.The supporting frame consists of two U shaped longitudinal beams 3, 4, open to the outside and of two transverse beams 5, 6.The transverse beam 5 is shorter than the transverse beam 6, so that the entirity is somewhat trapezoidal in shape. The upper side of the transverse beams 5 and 6, which are boxshaped, comprises a longitudinal slot 7. Each of the beams encloserone or more guide members 8 being slideable in the longitudinal direction thereof. The transverse beams 5 and 6 are interconnected by means of a central longitudinal beam 9 which is likewise box shaped and provided with a longitudinal slot 10. Said central longitudinal beam 9 may also accomodate one or more guide embers 8, which, though shown in fig. 2, are not shown in fig. 1. As is shown more in detail in fig. 3 a guide member 8 accomodates an upright 11 for clarity s sake only partially shown in fig. 1 which will be elucidated further with respect to said fig. 3.The conveying frame tb comprises a transverse beam 15 and longitudinal beams 16, 17 slightly diverging from said transverse beam 15. Each longitudinal beam 16, 17 is built up from a U profile beam 18 open to the underside, and a L profile beam 19 fitting around said beam 18 which beam 19 is likewise open to the underside and to the outside, said beam 19 being composed of, as seen in cross section, a horizontal leg 20 and a vertical leg 21 see fig. 3 . The vertical leg 21 supports the U profile beam 22 fitting into the longitudinalU shape profile beams 3, 4.The inside of the U profile beams 18 furthermore accomodates the wheels 23 and a plurality dependent upon the maximum load of the lifting frame of hydraulic or pneumatic lifting cylinders 24, which bear on the one hand upon transverse section s25 located within theU profile beam 18, said cylinders on the other hand acting upon the lower side of the leg 20 of the L shape profile beam 19, by means of the piston 26 thereof. Through suitable control valves, known per se not shown said lifting cylinders 24 are connected with a source of pressure fluid likewise not shown .The U shape profile beams 18, 19 are interconnected by means of a U shape profile beam 27 having an open underside to which assembly a towbar 29 is attached via a universal joint 28.To the flat surface of the profile beam 27 is connected a supporting plate 31 by means of the securing bolt 30 which supporting plate carries, via pivot shafts 32, 33 the wheel frames 34, 35 respectively, with in each frame a wheel 36, 37 respectively. Said wheels are of the known self castoring piano wheel type. Figures 4 and 5 show the respective wheel frame on an enlarged scale.Each upright 11 is made up from a lower outer tube 38, fitting into a sloping bore 39 in a guide member 8, and an inner tube 39 fitting within said outer tube 38 and being provided with a row of adjusting apertures 40 through which a locking pin 41 passes, while the upper end of tube 39 comprises a rotatable ring 42 having trapezoidal inner screwthread. Therein is screwed a screw rod 43 of which the end supports the supporting head 45 via a journal 44.The load being exerted upon a supporting head 45 can be resolved into a horizontal and a vertical component the horizontal component will cause the guide member 8 to cant slightly in the beam which encloses it, so that said guide member is effectively blocked against any displacement in the longitudinal direction of the beam.Fig. 2 shows how the central longitudinal beam 9 encioses two uprights 11a having a structure somewhat different from the one described above each of said uprights ends into a U shape supporting piece 46 comprising two supporting heads 47 bearing against the side of the hull. The use of said supporting heads 47 ensures an optimum support of the respective boat.After having obtained an approximate correct level of the supports by means of the adjusting apertures 40 and the locking pin 41, the boat is placed upon the cradle, and by rotating the rotatable screwthread rings 42 the supports with the supporting heads 45 are adjusted in such a manner that the boat is optimally supported. Subsequently the conveying frame 1b is wheeled around the supporting frame la with the boat on it and, when said conveying frame ib entirely embraces the supporting frame la the lifting cylinders are energized, thus causing the beams 19 and 15 to ascend so that the upper edges of the profile beams 22 will press against the underside of the profile beams 3, 4, so that the entire supporting frame together with the uprights supporting the boat, will be lifted. By means of a suitable tractor or by manpower, the assembly of conveying frame and supporting frame is conveyed towards its location, whereupon the lifting cylinders 24 are retracted and the supporting frame comes to rest upon the bottom. The conveying frame can then be wheeled away and be used for conveying another supporting frame.
