## Abstract
A power supply system comprising an a.c. voltage source ACS , a load LL and a detachable DCC cable connection CC . In order to prevent a dangerously high a.c. voltage from occurring between cable conductors CC1, CC2 when the Cable CC is loose, a safety circuit CITSR providing an on off switching circuit S1, SR1, S2, SR2 is provided. In accordance with the invention, there is present in the safety circuit CITSR a parallel arrangement CI of at least one capacitor C and a direct current source I , which parallel arrangement CI is present in a direct current circuit CC2, DC2, CC1, S1, DC1, CC2 which is closed via the cable conductors CC1, CC2 , the a.c. voltage source ACS and the load LL . The parallel ar rangement CI is coupled to the on off switching circuit S1, SR1, S2, SR2 via a threshold circuit TC . When a controllable a.c. voltage source ACS is used to produce a low voltage 30V and a high supply voltage 700V before the high voltage 700V is supplied, it is detected at the low voltage 30V whether there is a high ohmic load or a short circuit between the cable conductors CC1, CC2 .
