# A METHOD FOR THE PREPARATION OF A UNIFORM DISPERSION OF A FRIABLE SOLID FUEL, OIL AND WATER AND THE OBTAINED FUEL OIL WATER DISPERSION

## Abstract
A uniform dispersion of a friable solid fuel, e.g. coal, oil and water is prepared by grinding the solid fuel in a medium consisting essentially of oil until the mean particle size of the solid fuel is reduced to a value in the range 1 to 15 micron. Air is excluded during the grinding operation. Water is added to the resulting dispersion of solid and oil and the resulting mixture of solid, oil and water is homogenised in the absence of added dispersant or emulsifier. The final dispersion con tains 15 to 55 by weight solid, expressed as a percentage by weight of the total dispersion. The water enhances the stability of the dispersion.
