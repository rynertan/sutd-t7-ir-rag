# 1 Halomethyl 2 alkoxyethyl acrylates and methacrylates.

## Abstract
1 Halomethyl 2 alkoxyethyl acrylates and methacrylates useful for making acrylate and methacrylate polymers and copolymers. Preferred monomers are used to prepare fluorochemical copolymers which impart oil and water repellency to cellulosic materials and textile fibers. The fluorochemical copolymers are derived by weight from about 1 to 30 of the preferred monomers, 60 to 80 fluorochemical acrylate, 1 to 15 glycidyl acrylate or methacrylate, 1 to 6 of certain cationic acrylates or methacrylates, and 0 to 20 vinylidene chloride.
