# Coating process.

## Abstract
Thin, adherent coatings of PTFE are formed by rubbing dry, discrete particles of PTFE across the surface of a substrate, preferably on the surface of a fabric or felt polishing wheel. The particles are preferably smaller than 30 microns diameter. The peripheral speed of the wheel may be, for example, from 5 m sec to 100 m sec.
