# BLOCKED LENS THICKNESS GAUGE

## Abstract
Disclosed is a blocked lens thickness gauge 10 for mea suring the thickness of a semi finished lens 100 that is blocked for surfacing of the concave side thereof. A lens con tacting sensor shaft 70 is supported between two sets of or thogonally mounted ball bearings 66, 66 and a needle shaft 64 , the latter being supported on spring loaded bearings 68, 68 such that the needle shaft 70 is urged toward the lens contacting sensor shaft 70 by the spring loading. A slipping clutch is also provided to allow the needle shaft 64 to absorb inertia forces resulting from abnormal shocks.
