# System for testing functional electronic circuits.

## Abstract
A system 11 for enhancing the testability of functional electronic circuitry may be provided as a separate device or in corporated in circuits and includes serial or parallel control point input data capability applied through tri statable output drivers 24 to input nodes of circuit elements of functional cir cuitry without interference with such circuitry during non test ing situations, and receivers 31 for observing resultant logic states at output nodes of functional circuitry being tested. The system comprises a control point section 12 having a decod er demultiplexer 28 and a serializer 21 , and a visibility point section 13 having a serializer 34 and an encoder multiplexer 39 .
