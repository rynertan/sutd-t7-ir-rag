# Quinolone inotropic agents.

## Abstract
A quinolone inotropic agent of the formula CHEM or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein Het is an optionally substituted 5 or 6 membered monocyclic aromatic heterocyclic group attached by a carbon atom to the 5 , 6 , 7 or 8 position of said quinolone R, which is attached to the 5 , 6 , 7 or 8 position, is hydrogen, C1 C4 alkyl, C1 C4 alkoxy, C1 C4 alkylthio, C1 C4 alkylsulphinyl, C1 C4 alkylsulphonyl, halo, CF3, hydroxy, hydroxymethyl, or cyano R 1 is hydrogen, cyano C1 C4 alkoxy carbonyl, C1 C4 alkyl, nitro, halo, NR 3 R 4 or CONR 3 R 4 where R 3 and R 4 are each independently H or C1 C4 alkyl or together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached form a saturated 5 or 6 membered heterocyclic group optionally containing a further heteroatom or group selected from O, S and N R 5 where R 5 is H or C1 C4 alkyl R 2 is H, C1 C4 alkyl, or 2 hydroxyethyl Y is H or C1 C4 alkyl and the dotted line between the 3 and 4 positions represents an optional bond.
