# Apparatus for photosynthesis.

## Abstract
A photosynthetic reaction bath has thereinside a number of photoradiators in the form of narrow upright tubes. A baffle plate is disposed below the photo radiators and is formed with a number of apertures therethrough in a predetermined area thereof which may be a radially central area or a generally annular peripheral area. COâ‚‚ containing air is fed into the reaction bath through the apertures in the baffle plate to recirculate along a predetermined path inside the reaction bath due to the remaining non apertured part of the baffle plate. The function of the baffle plate may be performed by plugging which blocks the passage of the air through the spacings between the lower ends of the adjacent photoradiators in the predetermined area. The recirculation of the air may be caused more positively along a variable path by a rotor which is positioned below the photoradiators and rotatable by ejecting the air while supplying it to the interior of the reaction bath. The rotor is cushioned and supported by the air elected therefrom during operation.
