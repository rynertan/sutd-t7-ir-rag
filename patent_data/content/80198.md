# POLYMERIC FILMS HAVING ONE SIDED CLING AND COMPOSITIONS USEFUL IN THEIR PREPARATION

## Abstract
A polymeric film prepared from a relatively crystalline po lymer such as a copolymer of ethylene and an Î± olefin having at least 3 carbon atoms, e.g., 1 octene linear low density poly ethylene a relatively amorphous polymer such as low density polyethylene and a tackifying polymer such as a low molecular weight polybutene exhibits a substantially higher cling on one side than the other. A film of a low density polyethylene, linear low density polyethylene and a low molecular weight polybutene also exhi bits excellent film strengths and has unexpectedly high resist ance to tear, particularly in the cross direction.
