# A composition comprising ethylene based polymers.

## Abstract
The invention provides a novel resin composition of polymers of ethylene capable of giving a shaped article having outstandingly excellent mechanical properties but yet having very good processability or moldability. The resin composition is composed of 15 90 by weight of a homo polymer of ethylene and 85 10 by weight of a copolymer of ethylene and characterized by several parameters including the intrinsic viscosity, density and swelling ratio as well as satisfaction of the relationships between the melt index and the instrinsic viscosity and between the melt index and the melt tension expressed by the respective logarithmic equa tions. Industrially feasible processes for the preparation of such resin compositions are described in detail.
