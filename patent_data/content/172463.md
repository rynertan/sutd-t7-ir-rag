## Description
This invention relates to glutaconic acid derivatives useful as starting materials for producing e.g., anti bacterials. More specifically, it relates to a process for producing glutaconic acid derivatives III by a Michael type condensation of thiazoleacetic acid derivative I and alkoxy acrylic acid derivative II in the presence of base. wherein, R is amino or protected amino R¹ is an ester forming group R² is hydrogen, cyano, or esterified carboxy R³ is hydrogen, cyano, or esterified carboxy and R⁴ is lower alkyl or aralkyl The groups in the preceding formulas are explained below. In the protected amino R, representative amino protecting groups are 1C to 5C alkanoyl e.g., formyl, acetyl, isobutyr yl , halo 1C to 5C alkanoyl e.g., chloroacetyl , 2C to 6C alkoxyformyl e.g., methoxycarbonyl, t butoxycarbonyl, tri chloroethoxycarbonyl, iodoethoxycarbonyl , 8C to 15C aralkoxy formyl e.g., benzyloxycarbonyl, dimethylbenzyloxycarbonyl, nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl , 1C to 15C alkyl or aryl sulfonyl e.g., methanesulfonyl, ethanesulfonyl, benzenesulfonyl, toluenesulfonyl, bromobenzenesulfonyl , and other acyls or 19 to 20C triarylmethyl e.g., triphenylmethyl , 3C to 10C enamine forming group, tri 1C to 5C alkylsilyl e.g., tert butyl dimethylsilyl, trimethylsilyl , 2C to 10C Schiff base forming groups e.g., dimethylaminomethylidene, benzylidene , and other amino protecting groups. The ester forming group R¹, R⁵ and the protective group in the esterified carboxys R² and R³ can each be, for example, 1C to 8C alkyl e.g., methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, t butyl , 1C to 5C alkyl substituted by halogen, 1C to 5C alkoxy, 1C to 8C sulfonyl e.g., chloromethyl, trichloromethyl, methoxyethyl, methanesulfonylethyl , 2C to 5C alkenyl e.g., vinyl, propenyl, prenyl , 7C to 15C aralkyl e.g., benzyl, methylbenzyl, nitrobenzyl, methoxybenzyl, diphenylmethyl , or other conventional carboxy protecting groups. The lower alkyl R⁴ can be 1C to 5C alkyl e.g., methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, isobutyl, especially methyl and ethyl . Preferable aralkyls R⁴ can be 7C to 15C aralkyl e.g., benzyl, methylbenzyl . The Michael type reaction of this invention consists of the following steps i.e., the reaction of thiazoleacetic acid derivative I with the base to convert active methylene into carbanion Ia , the Michael addition of this anion to alkoxyacrylic acid derivative II giving an intermediate, alkoxyglutaric acid derivative Ib , and the elimination of alcohol R⁴OH from the latter to give glutaconic acid deriv ative III . The said carbanion formation, addition, and alcohol elimination each may proceed in the presence of the base under anhydrous condition. So, the isolation of intermediates Ia or Ib is not always necessary. Thus, thiazoleacetic acid derivative I is reacted with alkoxyacrylic acid derivative II, especially when R² is hydrogen to give objective glutaconic acid derivative III . Glutaconic acid ester derivatives III can be deesteri fied by e.g., hydrolysis , giving glutaconic acid derivatives IV when R² and R³ are both carboxy, followed by decarboxyl ation which are useful for producing penicillins and cephalo sporins. The base for the reactions can be a metal compound e.g., hydride or alkoxide of alkali metal. The carbanion formation and addition are carried out under dry condition. The addition proceeds well by contacting alkoxyacrylic acid derivative II preferably 1 to 5 equivalents, especially 1 to 3 equivalents with the carbanion formed in the preceding step. Addition product Ib can sometimes be isolated from the reaction mixture in a conventional way. The elimination of alcohol R⁴OH proceeds by the action of a base. This reaction can proceed rapidly also in a polar solvent e.g., water . Thus produced glutaconic acid derivative III is usually a mixture of geometrical isomers in relation to the double bond. The over all yield from thiazoleacetic acid derivative I may amount up to over 90 . Deprotection of this by e.g., hydrolysis gives glutaconic acid derivative IV . When R² and R³ in glutaconic acid ester III are both esterified carboxy, decarboxylation occurs simultaneously with the deprotection giving the same glutaconic acid derivative IV . The above steps proceed well in a solvent. Such solvent can be ether e.g., dimethoxyethane, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane , nitrile e.g., acetonitrile, propionitrile, benzonitrile , sulfoxide e.g., dimethylsulfoxide , amide e.g., N,N dimethyl formamide, N,N dimethylacetamide, hexamethylphosphorotriamide , ester e.g., methyl formate, ethyl acetate , or a mixture of these. Acrylic acid derivative II can serve as a solvent. The reaction is usually carried out well at 30 to 100 C especially 20 to 70 C often for 5 minutes to 10 hours. The starting thiazoleacetic acid derivative I and alkoxyacrylic acid derivative II are known compounds or easily available from known compounds. The intermediates i.e., alkoxyglutaric acid derivative Ib , glutaconic acid ester derivative III , and glutaconic acid derivative IV are all novel compounds.
