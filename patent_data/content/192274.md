# Process for manufacturing composite pipes.

## Abstract
Improved composite pipes 1 are proposed which comprise an outer pipe 2 made of plastic and a thin lead layer 3 on the inner wall of the outer pipe 2 . The lead layer 3 is formed by arranging a lead pipe 4 in the outer pipe 2 and expanding it by use of pressure medium into close contact with the inner wall of the outer pipe 2 . The outer pipe 2 may be circular or square or double path. A process for producing the composite pipes 1 is also proposed.
