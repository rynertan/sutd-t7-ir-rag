## Description
Improved surface coatings applicator This invention relates to an improved surface coatings applicator which has particular application to its use with a cleaning container. One example of an applicator according to this invention is a paint brush having a bristle or filament cluster comprised of bristles filaments of specific lengths, colour shade and or colour patterns. The brush handle may be of one, or more contoured structural sections and according to the invention has a series of several strategically located openings such that this applicator will be easier to clean when used in conjunction with a described cleaning container or a household food container and therefore have a longer useful life. The special cleaning container assembly described herein, is made of a clear or semi clear, solvent resistant, rigid or semi rigid material comprising a a base structure which holds the cleaning solvent and optional brush rod support brackets, and b a cover that reduces the spillage or evaporation of the solvent. Most painters, professional and non professional, severely reduce the life of paint brushes by improper use or cleaning. Several text books on correct painting techniques specifically state that the paint brush should be dipped into the paint supply, no more than one half the length of the filament cluster e.g. bristles .Dipping the brush deeper results in the paint saturating the filaments nearest the brush ferrule resulting in the potential for the paint to harden in an area of the brush that is difficult to clean. It is accordingly, one principal aim of a preferred embodiment according to this invention to obviate such a problem by the provision of filament lengths colour shade and, colour patterns that act as a visual aid to reduce the tendency of a painter to improperly dip the paint brush into a paint supply. Realizing the possibility that any painter can accidentally dip a paint brush too deeply into the paint, another aim of this invention is to provide a paint brush that can be cleaned effectively by proper soaking in an appropriate paint coatings solvent. The strategically located handle openings enable the painter to use a wire 6r rod to hang the applicator in a number of common household containers filled with solvent to the proper level immediately. Furthermore, these openings are located as to enable several different lengths of filaments to be soaked in the same container of solvent on the same wire or rod. Other important advantages or aims of this invention will become apparent from the following description read in conjunction with the accompanying drawing, in which Figure 1 is a perspective view of the paint brush, Figure 2 is a sectional view showing two different sizes of this paint brush being soaked in a paint cleaner solvent, Figure 3 is a sectional view of a preferred container assembly, and Figure 4 is an enlarged end view of some of the several support rod bracket configurations possible in a container as shown in Figure 3. Referring to Figure 1, a surface coatings applicator is shown having a cluster of filaments e.g. bristles 1 inserted part way into one end of a tubular ferrule 3 to substantially seal one end 9 of the ferrule. A hardened mass of cured, resinous cement not shown is disposed atop the cluster of filaments 1 in firm adhesive connection with portions of the cluster of filaments in the ferrule 3. Also secured into the ferrule 3 is a contoured handle 4 of rigid material the handle extending outwardly from the other end of the ferrule 3. Included in the cluster of filaments 1 are guide filaments 2, the projecting length of the filaments 1 being approx imately twice as long as the projecting length of the guide filaments 2. The guide filaments 2 are of a different colour than the main filaments 1 to ensure there is a clear visual line around the cluster of filaments 1 marking the half length position of the latter. For example, black main bristles in the cluster 1 and white guide bristles 2 or white main filaments 1 and red guide filaments 2 would create the required visual aid to help prevent a painter from dipping the cluster of filaments too deeply into a supply of paint. Equally effective for providing such a visual indication would be main filaments 1 having via permanent dying, staining, coating, heat discoloration, pigmentation, etc. a distinct change in colour and or shade of colour at the approximate midpoint of the bristles filaments 1. The colour or shade marking can extend up to the edge 9 of the ferrule 3 as a solid colour shade or as an intermittent pattern such as distinct lines of colour shade perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the filaments 1.The filaments for the main cluster and the guide filaments can be natural bristle or any other material suitable for manufacturing a surface coatings applicator. Based on some of the books cited, the proper way to clean paint hardened filaments 1 and 2 is to immerse the filaments in a reservoir 13 of paint solvent. Many current designs of brush handle 4 have a single hole 5 located near the extreme upper end of the handle 4.However soaking the filaments of such a brush by supporting it from the rim of a container with a rod passing through the hole 5 would require using a very tall container 12, because the cluster of filaments 1 should not, while soaking, be permitted to touch the bottom of the container 12 or the filaments 1 could become bent and consequently reduce or destroy their usefulness.It has therefore been proposed to provide an opening 8 in the handle 4 of a brush through which a support rod can pass when the brush is hung up in a container of solvent. In general a larger paint brush 15 has a longer filament cluster 1 and or 2 and a longer handle 4 than a smaller paint brush 14. However, the proper level of paint solvent during soaking is still just below the ferrule edge 9 regardless of the brush size. Therefore it would not be possible to efficiently soak a large brush 15 and a small brush 14 at the same time in the same container 12, if the only rod supporting opening provided in each handle was the opening 8 adjacent to the top edge of the respective ferrule 9. In accordance with the invention, each brush is provided with a series of openings substantially aligned along the length of the handle. As shown in Figure 1 for the purpose of illustration, openings 6 and 7 are positioned different distances from the ferrule bottom edge 9. These distances having been chosen such as to allow correct soaking of the filament cluster 1 in a typical United States three pound and one pound coffee can, respectively. Opening 8 is positioned for bristle 1 and 2 soaking in a United States number 303 can, commonly used as a one pound can in that Country. By providing a series of openings 6, 7, 8 the opening 8 on the larger brush 15 and the opening 7 in the smaller brush 14 can be used with a common rod 10 to correctly suspend these two brushes in a common reservoir of solvent. The rod 10 and any opening 6, 7, 8 may be of any convenient shape. An oval or polygonal cross section may be preferred, for example, to prevent brush rotation, in those cases where the centroid of mass of the brush is above the rod. Figure 3 shows one configuration of an applicator cleaning container assembly 16 having a solvent reservoir 13 contained in a base 17, a cover lid 18 and an assembly carrying handle strap 19. The base 17 may have integral mounting brackets 20 four examples of which are shown enlarged in Figure 4 that internally support a rod 10 which in turn, internally supports the applicators 14, 15. The base 17 may also support the rod 10 by way of rod support openings 27 in a side wall of the base 17.This configuration is easily adapted to common household containers 12 in which a cover 21 wavy line could be for one of several examples a flexible solvent resistant material affixed to the base 17 by a semi elastic rubber band like element 22 which can be readily affixed to the container 16 below a flange 26 integral with the base 17. Figure 3 also shows possible configurations for the handles 4 and further shows the possibility of having multi sectioned handles 4. In Figure 3 the handles of brushes 14 and 15 are in two sections 23, 24 that are joined together by screw thread or compression type fittings 25. The fittings 25 of the brush 14 is preferred, because having a male portion on the lower section 24 renders this easier to clean. A facility to remove the upper handle section 23 of a brush, permits the container assemblies 12, 16 to be much shorter since only the filament cluster 1 and or 2 of the lower section 24 need be housed therein. Also shown in Figure 3 are special handle contours or ribs 28 that give a much better surface for the painter to grip should the handle become slippery with paint. Figure 4 shows four different support brackets 20 for rods 10. It will be noted that three non circular rods are shown and these could be used with openings 6, 7, 8 of similar non circular cross section. Various modifications of surface coatings applicator according to the invention are clearly possible within the ambit of the following claims. Three openings 68 are shown in Figures 1 and 2 but only two or more than three are clearly possible.
