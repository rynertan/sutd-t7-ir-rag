The liberation of the active components together can result in improved absorption, metabolic stability and urinary recovery of the antibacterial agent. Table 4 shows mouse urinary recovery figures for the compounds of Examples 1 and 2 together with the figures when the equivalent parent antibacterial agents were administered alone. The results show that considerably more antibacterial agent is recovered when administered in the form of the compounds of Examples 1 and 2. By way of comparison. the parent antibacterial agent of the compound of Example 2 ie sodium salt of 2 acetamido ethenylthioi 6 l hydroxysulphonyloxyethyl 7 oxo l azabicyclo 3.2.0 hept 2 ene 2 carboxylic acid was administered together with the corresponding dipeptidase inhibitor ie 2 isovaleramidobut 2 ene in a 1 1 relationship. The results show that approximately the same quantity of antibacterial agent was recovered. However, since the compound of Example 2 liberates an approximate ratio of 2 1 by weight of antibacterial agent to inhibitor, the compound of Example 2 makes much more efficient use of the dipeptidase inhibitor.
