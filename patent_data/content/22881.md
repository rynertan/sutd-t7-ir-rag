## Description
Accelerated Pulping ProcessThis invention relates to an improved process of making fibre in a form ranging from a moderately digested product fit for animal feed to pulps that can be utilized as conventional semi chemical, chemical types for packaging papers or fully delignified pulps for bleaching from fibrous, ligno cellulosic raw material.More particularly, it relates to a nitration pulping process using nitric acid or nitrate salts in which the time required for nitration and the second step extraction of the nitrated li gneous components in the fibrous raw material is substantially shortened due to the inclusion in the nitric acid of a small amount of aluminium sulphate paper maker s alum , and by use of the inherent flexibility of the process time, temperature and chemical concentration , the utilization of controlled delignification to produce animal feed, building board, packaging boards and paper. So far as I am aware, nitric acid pulping processes, of which many have been proposed, have never been commercially successful for various reasons, chief among which is the relatively long chemical treatment time that they required far exceeding the present day conventional methods.Shortened times were possible if strong nitric acid was used, or if pressurized vessels and high temperatuns were employed, but those conditions create other problems such as excessive and explosive emission of toxic nitrogen oxide fumes and damage to the cellulosic fibre structure. Moreover, recovery of the acid has not been possible, and the use of relatively concentrated nitric acid, e.g. 15 to 42 bywt.HNO3, becomes therefore prohibitively expensive. In short, the nitric acid pulping processes heretofore proposed have offered no advantages and many disadvantages over present day conventional systems.As recently as 1960 a published comprehensive review on nitric acid pulping byCrown Zellerbach Corporation stated that while nitric acid was specific for the reaction with lignin, the use of acid reagent was excessive and uneconomicaand pollution problems remained unsolved.The process of this invention uses only 0.15 9.0 nitric acid in relation to fibre yield which, together with the alkali used for delignification, is no more than with Invention nal methods of pulping without chemical recovering systems while eliminating the complex requirements of recovery and or manufacture of the cooking liquors. Furthermore, since the process is a two step one, the nitrating solution can, except for that absorbed in the fibre structure, be recovered virtually intact and recycled. More importantly, unlike previous attempts with nitric acid, this new process does not dissolve the lignin content of fibrous structures in the acid stage.Conventional pulp mills require high investment due to the high temperatures and pressure involved, and if water and air pollution is controlled and chemical recovery is practiced costs are substantially higher. The process of this invention uses simple chemicals available in crystalline or dissolved form, does not require superatmospheric pressure, or temperatures over 100 C, offers minimal problems of air and water pollution, and offers economic usability of the products normally wasted by burning or dumping.I have now discovered that in a chemical pulping process involving impregation of particulate, fibrous, lignocellulosic raw material with nitric acid which may be or not be followed by alkaline extraction from the material of the resulting nitrated lignin, leaving softened, partially defibered cellulosic structures which can be completely defibered by mechanical pulping means, the total time required for the nitration and extraction steps can be shortened considerably by including a small amount of aluminium sulphate paper maker s alum in the nitric acid.While the precise time required for the nitration extraction operation is dependent upon the variables of particle thickness, temperature and reagent concentration, it can be said for the process of the present invention that it generally enables one to perform the nitration extraction operation somewhere in the range from about 20 minutes minimum for high yield wood chemical pulps for packaging papers and boards, to a maximum time of 50 minutes for easily bleached pulps without using pressure and with temperatures not exceeding 1000C.Those times are to be compared to the conventional sulphite process times of 6.25 hours and 7.50 hours and the sulphate process times of 2.5 and 5.0 hours,respectively,at high pressures and temperatures, as set forth in the following table I Table I Pulping Processes Compared Liquor Total Temperature, Pressure, Fibre Total Concetration, Cooking C P.S.I.G.

However, the addition of alkali is necessary for the pro duction of animal feeds and would be normally used in the production of semi chemical pulp where maximum defiberiza tion for minimum chemical treatment is desired. The ability of the present process to be conducted under atmospheric pressure eliminates the need of explosive re lease of pressure that is used in conventional chemical pulp systems to defibre the fibrous structures within chips or chopped materials. The basic preservation of the fi brous structure permits easy recycling of the fibrous structure through an additional gentle cooking cycle, if required, and easy drainage of cooking liquor and washing out of the residual black liquor leaving the fibrous struc ture substantially intact. Defiberization is then accompli shed mechanically with gentleness and rapidity, with mini mum loss of fibre length and degradation of basic fibre structure. Additionally, the defiberization can be closely controlled to preserve long thin fibre bundles from fibrous structures made up of very short under 0.5mm fibres such as straw thus improving strength and drainage characteristics. All forms of ligno cellulosic materials can be subjected to the pulping process of the present invention. That in cludes, without limitation, woody materials such as U.S.Southern pine, spruce, beech and bamboo, as well as grassy materials which find minor usage such as straws, bagasse and kenaf. In addition to these normally used sources of paper making fibre, other, now wasted, fibrous plants as rape seed straw and rice husks which resist conventional pulping methods can easily be reduced to potentially useful fibre by this process. High yield shrub growth such as coppice willow found extensively in Ireland and presently unused produces, including its bark, an acceptable, clean and economic paper making fibre. Besides such virgin materials, the process of the present invention can be used to delignify and further defibre paper wastes, such as waste corrugated boxes containing semi chemical board.Finally, it becomes practical to economically pulp small accumulations of wood slab waste and sawdust which are most often burned.The raw material should be in particulate form before being submitted to the nitration step. Virgin plant material, for example, should be chopped, crushed, chipped or flaked.Paper wastes should be mechanically pulped in water to the defibered state, for example to obtain a slurry containing about 7 to 9 wt. cellulose. When it is wood that is to be pulped, the required nitration extraction time will be shorter and the pulp more uniform if the wood particles are thinner. It has been found expecially advantageous to use wood flakes, i.e. particles about 0.3 to 0.8 mm thick obtained by cutting the log tangentially to the circumference. Flaking is the cutting process used in manufacturing particleboard.At the present time the paper manufacturing industry uses wood chips almost exclusively, the thickness of which is usually in the range of about 6 to 1Omm. Horsepower consumption for the flaking of logs is roughly equivalent to that for chipping, as are production levels and flexibility in handling short or long or different diameter logs. The use of flakes does require higher cubic handling and cooking capacities than does chips, but flaking is nonetheless economically acceptable in the pulping process of this invention because high pressure pressurized cooking vessels with restricted volumes are not required.Use of wood flakes, rather than the thicker chips, speeds nitric acid impregnation and also shortens the time required for outward diffusion of dissolved lignin in the subsequent alkaline extraction step. Additionally, flaking is accomplished by cutting around the circumference of the log, much as veneers are made, whereas chipping is performed by cutting at the end of the log, the fibre length is essentially preserved in flakes and the fibre ends are not crushed. Chipping, on the other hand, fractures the fibres and crushes their ends. The more intact fibre structures and greater exposed surface of the flakes are more easily penetrated by the chemicals used in the nitration and extraction steps of the present process. The fibres produced from flakes are marginally shorter than those of conventional chips.Where a pulp is required for rough papers, i.e. brown or packaging papers and boards, conventional chips can be used after subjecting them to conventional crushing which reduces them to rough splinters 1.5 3.0mm thick, 4.0 8.Omm side and 25mm long.The nitration cooking of the ligno cellulosic raw material is accomplished by submerging or wetting with recycled acid the material in a sufficient amount of aqueous nitric acid at elevated temperature, preferably 85 to 1000C to penetrate the fibrous structure and react with the lignin.In order to permit the use of an open vessel for the nitration step, without the emission of harmful nitrogen oxide vapors, it is preferred to use very dilute nitric acid, say having an HNO, concentration of about 0.15 to 9.0 weight percent, e.g. 0.15 to 5.5 weight percent, preferably less than 5.5 weight percent and most preferred less than 5 weight percent. It can be preferred to subject the lignocellulosic raw material to an impregnation step before the cooking nitration step.The impregnation is done with a dilute concentration of the cooking liquor at low tem peratures e.g. 700C or below, e.g. 500C or below and serves three purposes a Utilization of drained concentrated liquor after the cooking process together with the dilute cooking liquor from the washing process, b conservation of heat by recycling liquor, and c even moisture distribution throughout the fibrous structure before cooking.Whereas the cooking step is not necessarily preceeded by an impregnation step, an impregnation step is always followed by a cooking step.The preferred acid strength in the cooking nitration step depends upon the nature of the ligno cellulosic raw material being pulped. For U.S. Southern pine, for example, which is relatively high in lignin content over 30 wt. , and contains a high percentage of resins and waxes it is preferred to use an HNO3 concentration of tin or at least 4.5 or 5.5 wt. . Wheat straw, on the other hand, is low in lignin content about 15 wt. and is preferably cooked and nitrated with nitric acid having an HNO, concentration of only about 0.8 to 1.5 wt. for production of chemical pulp. These concentrations are based on a normal nitration period of 15 minutes and production of chemical type pulp.Where impregnation periods and longer time is used the acid concentration can be drastically reduced. For example, spruce flakes impregnation 30 minutes at 0.58 concentration plus cooking and nitration, respectively, 45 minutes at 1.75 . Where a pulp of lower purity i.e. less delignification is required the said concentration can be reduced, as in animal feed or semi chemical pulp. As a practical matter it will usually be woody plant material that is twice subjected to the cookingnitration lignin extraction sequence, since grassy plant materials and paper wastes can have their ligneous components nitrated and almost completely extracted in one sequence using relatively stron ger, but still dilute, nitric acid, and obtain pulp of adequate cellulosic purity and easy bleachability.Even with woody raw materials, a single nitration extraction sequence is all that is required where the pulp product is to be used to make linerboard and lower brightness papers and not to make high purity cellulose or high brightness paper.In the process of the present invention the nitric acid impregnation liquor is augmented with a nitration accelerating amount of aluminum sulphate, preferably about 0.8 to 1.3 parts thereof per each 10 parts by weight of Etna3. As stated above, the presence of the aluminum sulphate in the nitric acid serves to shorten dramatically the time required to dissolve the nitrated lignin in the subsequent alkaline extraction step. Normal usage is 1.0 part of the aluminum sulphate per each 10 parts by weight of Ion03. 100 . The amount of nitric acid used in the nitration step should be sufficient to completely react by submergence or contact by recirculation the particulate ligno cellulosic material and adequate on a stoichiometric basis to nitrate all of the lignin content of the raw materials. This will usually mean formation of a mixture of 5 parts of liquid acid to 1.0 part of dry wood to 10 parts of liquid acid for 1.0 part of dry grass fibre straw . Where the acid liquor can be circulated and heated indirectly lower ratios can be used. Additionally the acid can be sprayed or foamed in low concentration on grassy fibres to form an intimate mixture to a composite moisture content of 35 to 50 and then subjected to heat for reaction at once or at later date six months or more without degredation.The temperature at which the nitric acid cooking step is performed should be adequate to effect nitration of the lignin, but is preferable not so high as to cause degradation of the cellulosic fibres. Temperatures within the range of about 85 to 100 C, in particular about 85 to 950C, are preferred. Since the nitration extraction portion of the process of the present invention can be performed in such a short period of time, it is possible to conduct both of those steps under atmospheric pressure conditions, although superatmospheric pressures, e.g. from 10 to 35 p.s.i.g.,can be used if it is desired to shorten the nitration time slightly but chiefly to provide ease of processing on a continuous basis.The improvement provided by the present invention is independent of whether the process is conducted under atmospheric pressure or at elevated pressures.The introduction of a non pressure system is designed specifically for use in new and relatively small pulping installations 10 50 tons per day throughout the world. However, it is recognized that the requirement for larger production units can be met and that in many instances existing pulp mill equipment could be utilized to reduce investment costs in preventing present pollution problems.All present systems use high pressures and temperatures coupled with long cooking periods for fully defibered or chemical pulps from either wood or grasses. It has been found that by cooking with light pressures 15 35psig while holding temperatures at 11 00C or below, preferably below 1 000C most preferably 95 0C the nitration period can be shortened to 5 7 minutes for wood flakes, straw, etc. Conventional sized wood chips can also be readily pulped although the cooking time period is extended to one hour requiring two nitration steps with a preliminary defibering step between.Alternatively, the chips can be crushed previous to filling the digester and the nitration step limitea to one step which additionally avoids the possibility of over and under reacted fibrous structures. These methods of using light pressures with either wood flakes or chips makes practical, for example, the conversion of existing sulphite pulp mills to this process. Other pulping systems such as the Kamyr or Pandia system, which are continuous, operating at high pressure,150 175 psig, are also adaptable for processing wood chips in one stage producing a semichemical type after normal mechanical defibering or full chemical pulp. Thus, in a special embodiment of the inventive process the nitration step is operated at a pressure of about 100 to 150 psig when using as starting material crushed wood chips as used in conventional processes today.See Table IIa Comparative HNO PressureNitration Cycles . Normal Chemical or Delignified Pulp Additionally it has been found that the use of pressure permits full defibering of the fibrous structure in the nitration stage without production of black liquor thus avoiding the lignin alkali extraction phase. This is accomplished by raising the HN03 liquor concentration by 2.5 3.5 over that required for the nitration alkali delignification sequence and extending the time of reaction slightly, 3 5 minutes. Thus, without using pressure, i.e.conducting the process under approximately atmospheric pressure conditions, the HN03 liquor concentration is preferably at most 5.5 weight percent, in particular at most 5 weight percent. When employing pressure, the HN03 concentration can go up to 9.0 weight percent and preferably it is no more than 7.5 or 7.0 weight percent. Of course, the lower concentrations as stated for the pressurized nitration step can be advantageously used.The process without delignification produces a fibre for different and limited end use papers than that of the Table IIaCmparative HNO3 Pressurized Nitration Cycles, Normal Chemical or Delignified Pulp with Alkali Stage A.

It is of very light colour, high yield and can be easily bleached to high brightness levels, but not by normal alkaline bleaching. The reduced handling of the fibrous structure greatly improves its drainage properties and facilitates washing which is a major problem today in bleaching short fibre structures such as straw.In all theses uses of pressure it is not necessary to vent any gases in fact it is economic that with the gases be contained and retained to create a false pressure and keeping operating temperatures below 1000C thus avoiding cellulose degradation. The degree of fals pressure created is dependent on acid concentration.See following Table IIb Comparative HN03 Pressure Nitration Cycles . No Delignification Stage. Where additional pressure is needed as in the UKamyr process to facilitate operation it can be obtained with air injections. The ability to conduct the nitration step at atmospheric pressure means that substantially open vessels can be employed providing substantial savings in equipment cost compared to conventional superatmospheric pulping processes.Although an open vessel can be employed for the nitration step, it is preferred to maintain closure with recycling of vapors to prevent possible troublesome emission of nitrogen oxide vapors. Present environmental laws in theU.S.A. permit a maximum nitrogen oxide emission level of only 185ppm. The precise temperature at which nitrogen oxide will be released from the slurry in the nitration step will depend upon the concentration of the nitric acid, since the higher the acid concentration, the lower will be the temperature at which nitrogen oxide vapor emissions will occur.By way of further explanation, nitric acid decomposes at Table IIb Comparative HNO3 Pressurized Nitration Cycles, Alkali Delignification Stage EliminatedA.

If nitric acid having an HN03 concentration greater than about 3.0 wt. is heated in the presence of cellulose to above about 650C then an exothermic reaction with the cellulose will result. For this reason, where an impregnation step becomes preferable to economize on nitric acid consumption through recycling of partly spent or diluted acid it is desirable to maintain low temperatures, e.g. 500C or below. Temperatures over 850C will produce nitrogen oxide gas which depending on the acid concentration wit be more than the water can hold in solution and will have to be contained.When an open vessel is being used to conduct the nitration step in the process of the present invention, it will usually be preferred to employ a temperature no higher than about 900C or 950C. However, as stated herein before, when operating the nitration step under pressure a temperature of up to 1100C, preferably up to 1000C, can be employed.It is an outstanding advantage of the process of the present invention that it can be performed in non pressure vessels in short time periods, without causing air pollution problems.The nitration step, and indeed the entire process of the present invention, can be carried out continuously, semicontinuously, or batchwise, whichever is desired. Selection of equipment will of course depend upon that choice. It is generally more economical to conduct the process continuously in which event the nitration step can advantageously be conducted in some type of screw conveyor unit.Batchwise nitrations can be carried out quite well in a hydrapulper making possible the economic operation of very small mills.The nitric acid impregnation and cooking steps are conducted for a time sufficient to produce the required residual level of the ligneous component of the ligno cellulosic raw material after extraction of the lignin. If the nitration extraction sequence is performed twice, each nitration step can be conducted for a shorter period than if it were performed just once. The time required to effect the desired degree of nitration is dependent, of course, on the strength of the nitric acid used, as well as the temperature employed, since higher acid strengths and higher temperatures promote the nitration reaction.Additional considerations are the type and particle size of the ligno cellulosic material being processed. In general, with the process of the present invention the total nitration time, whether performed in one step or broken down into two nitration extraction sequences, can be as short as 5 minutes or extended to 45 minutes. For straw or bagasse which will go into dry storage before lignification a simple spray or foam application at lower levels of acid concentration at room temperatures is all that is necessary. Following the nitration step the ligno cellulosic material is separated from the nitric acid solution and preferably washed with water to remove surface acid. The wash water is preferably hotJe.g. at a temperature of about 85 to 100 C and is used in minimal amounts.One efficient method of separating and washing the nitrated ligno cellulosic material is by spindraining the slurry in a rotary dryer, followed by water washing the solids in the same vessel. Another method, if a continuous system is used, is draining followed by reverse flow washing.Alternatively, draining, followed by flooding with wash water and a second draining can be used. The separated nitric acid is advantageously recycled to the nitration step to be used again, as is the acidic wash water. Both solutions will be relatively clear, but may be slightly coloured due to the presence of small amounts of dissolved material. The recycled nitric acid stream will be fortified with concentrated nitric acid and with fresh aluminum sulphate so as to restore the concentrations of those reagents to the desired levels.The nitrated fibrous structures remain intact and appear to be essentially the same as when those particles were introduced to the nitric acid submersion step, except for some softening and a slightly darker colour. The nitrated fibrous structures can be held in storage for months without either deteriorating or causing problems in the lignin extraction and defibering steps which follow. This storability feature can be of special advantage in the case where straw, bagasse or similar grassy plants are to be pulped. Grassy plants are usually harvested during relatively short seasons, causing temporary, seasonal surges in supply of that raw material to the pulp mills. Since the demand for the finished pulp is relatively constant, however, it becomes necessary to periodically store large quantities of the excess ligno cellulosic raw material. This presents a problem because grassy plants are particularly susceptible to bacterial or fungi attack during storage. By the process of the present invention the excess raw material can be nitrated without delay,by spraying or foaming a dilute solution of acid to obtain intimate, overall contact with the fibre to a total moisture content of 30 to 50 , and held in storage in that form without being degraded by bacteria.tended periods of storage have beend experienced up to one year in contact with the acid at a moisture level of 30 50 permitting usage of a very low percentage of acid to dry fibre, i.e. 1 3 .The nitrated ligno cellulosic material is next submerged in an alka line, aqueous extraction solution, e.g. a solution of sodium, pc tassium, and or ammonium hydroxide, so as to dissolve most of the nitrated lignin out of the fibrous structure. The lignin nitrate is substantially insoluble in acidic aqueous media, but is readily dissolved in basic aqueous media, for example having a pH of about 12.The alkaline concentration of the extraction solution must be sufficient that the solution will leach out by dissolving most of the nitrated ligneous material in the fibrous structure. Usually it is preferred to use an alkaline strength NaOH, KOH, or NH4OH of preferably about 0.1 to 0.5 wt. . If the nitration extraction sequence is performed twice on the ligno cellulosic material, then the alkaline strength used in the second extraction step need not be as high as that employed for the first extraction. Often the concentration of the alkaline solution used in the second nitration extraction sequence will be about one fifth to one half that which is used in the initial sequence.The alkaline consumption is basically one of bringing the starting pH to about 12, and is therefore somewhat dependent on the concentration of residual acid remaining. The amount of the alkaline extraction solution used should be adequate to completely submerge the ligno cellulosic material and dissolve most of the nitrated ligneous components. Usually the amount of alkaline extraction solution used will provide a slurry containing about 5 to 8 wt. of the cellulosic fibre.The temperature at which the alkaline extraction step is conducted should be sufficiently high to effect dissolution of most of the nitrated ligneous material. Preferably a temperature of about 75 to 1000C is used. Temperatures as low as 150C can be used which will extend the time necessary for delignification. These low temperatures are particularly important in producing animal feed or partially ddiberedpulp fran agricultural residues. Where straw as an example for an agricultural residue has been sprayed with nitric acid and held in storage, delignification with alkali under 500C willproduce a fully defibered pulp. The alkaline extraction step is best performed under atmospheric pressure conditions, thereby permitting the use of an open vessel and avoidance of expensive high pressure equipment. If desired, however, for example to further shorten the extraction time or utilize existing pressurized equipment, high temperatures and superaunospheric pressures, e.g. up to 10 or 15 p.s.i.g., can be used for the extraction. Increased time and temperatures using alkaline solutions will result normally in sane degradation of the cellulose.As discussed above with regard to the nitration step, the nitration extraction sequence can be conducted just once, or it can be repeated, in which event each extraction step can be performed for a shorter period of time than if it were performed just once. It will be recognized that the time required to effect the desired degree of extraction is dependent on the particle size and type of the ligno cellulosic material, and the temperature at which the extraction is conducted. In general, however, the total time required for the ligninextraction, whether performed in one step or broken dan into two extractions, will be no more than about 20 minutes, often being within the range of about 5 to 15 minutesIf an open vessel is used for the extraction step, it can advantageously be a hydrapulper.If a closed vessel is used, a screw conveyor may be preferred. After treatment with the alkaline extraction solution, the fibrous, cellulosic material is separated from the lignin containing solution, preferably in a high density press. If, however, the fibre bundles are to be subjected to a second nitration extraction sequence, then it will suffice to just drain off the extraction liquor. After the extraction step, the alkaline solution contains dissolved ligneous components and is reddish brown in colour. It is usually referred to as black liquor . During start up of the process all of the separated black liquor, together with the alkaline wash water, can be returned to the extraction vessel for reuse.As the process is continued, however, the content of dissolved solids in the black liquor will grow to a maximum tolerable concentration,e.g., somewhere in the range of about 10 to 25 wt. , depending upon the quality of product desired. At that point an appropriate portion of the black liquor should be regularly removed and replaced with make up clear alkali liquor in order to prevent further increase in the concentration of the dissolved solids. The black liquor purge stream could be disposed of by various means such as by dumping as waste, or by concentrating and burning. Alternatively, the black liquor purge stream can be combined with the completely defibered pulp to supply ligneous binder for fiber web products prepared from the pulp, especially paperboard.When the alkali lignin extraction process is complete the pH of the black liquor will be almost neutral, about 7.5 to 8.5 which is far lower than that of conventional alkaline processes the pH of which is usually in the range of 12 14. This factor of almost neutral pH makes the black liquor substantially more amenable to being handled in subsequent chemical processing. Sulphite acid systems produce black liquor in a pH range of 1.0 2.0.Additionally, the black liquor has a very low range ofBOD5 Biological Oxygen Demand 5 day and COD ChemicalOxygen Demand which together with its chemical make up permits its discharge in controlled amounts, up to 30 , in the normal urban effluent stream.Typical comparative pollution data are as follows Values in mg litre Accelerated WastePaper Sulphite Pulping Mill Mill Black Black Liquor Effluent Liquor From Spruce 5 day biological oxygen demand 1500 8010 HighChemical oxygen demand 5685 16700 230,000Permanganate number 11215 400,000The BOD5 value when related to recently recorded NorthAmerica BOD5 discharges per ton of pulp produced shows the following values, sulphite mill 109 kg integrated sulphate pulp and paper mills 15 kg waste paper mill 10 kg and the accelerated pulping process 30 kg. The low figure of the sulphate mill is reached only by burning all the black liquor solids produced to recover the major portion of the chemicals used in the process and the strict control of pollutants. Although the black liquor could be discharged in a controlled manner into normal drainage facilities, it can be utilized uniquely and economically in a variety of ways as a binder, water repellent or size, extender for fortified rosin size, stiffening agent in paper board, fertilizer, hygroscopic additive to soil, extender for resins such as phenolics, and retention agent in papermaking. The solids in the black liquor are referred to as ligneous component. Although there are other chemical components than lignin and lignin nitrate, respectively, such as gums, waxes, etc. the lignin is the major component. Moreover, when precipitating the lignin, some of the said further components precipitate with the lignin. This is to be recognized when speaking of ligneous component.The useful ligneous component can be precipitated from its mother black liquor by acidifying, preferably to a pH of 5.5 with any acid, but of particular usefulness are ordinary papermaker s alum aluminum sulphate 1 recycled nitric acid from the process, and phosphoric acid.For normal papermaking the black liquor precipitant ligeous component resulting from acidification, e.g.lwith nitric acid or alum, can be added to the cellulosic pulp slurry, foamed either in precipitated form or in form of the extraction liquor itself and added at the wet presses or size press,or can be added in its neutral pH form black liquor and acidified or not at the size press or wet presses. Unlike kraft liquor the black liquor under any normal treatment either in solution or precipitated exhibits the minimum and non troublesome amount of foaming.The foaming of the black liquor, either itself or in concentrated form precipitated ligneous component can be done by using a commercial surfactant or non surfactant foaming chemical to foam water with air and then add as required the black liquor. This kind of application is known to the expert per se. However, not with the ligneous component.Addition of the precipitated black liquor ligneous component to the pulp slurry immediately lowers the stock freeness, i.e. drainage rate as it holds or retains the fine suspended particles usually lost through drainage on the paper machine wire.Addition of the black liquor to paper fibres in normal amounts up to 15 based on the solids and calculated on the dry weight of the fibre will increase the strength properties, i.e. burst strength and stiffness,in an approximate ratio of improvement of 1 1 to 2 1 for equal weight of cellulose fibre depending on the degree of openness of the fiber web making up the paper. When combined with the starch solution and added at high temperature 65 C or above at the size press, a satisfactory sizing of the board COBB 50 will be obtained, and the effectiveness of the starch on improving paper quality is greatly improved permitting reduced starch usage. A percentage of 0.4 to 0.6 of black liquor solids on the dry fibre content is sufficient.Addition in its neutral form up to 60 solids to a solution of 20 neutralized urea and 20 fortified rosin size will obtain sizing properties essentially equal to that of the rosin size when used alone. This combination can be precipitated on fibre suspensions in the conventional manner with alum. The neutral form of the black liquor precipitate is hygroscopic when dried and can be used when combined with fast draining materials such as sandy soils to retain moisture and chemicals. When the fibre cooking process and subsequent precipitation is formulated with all or part of those three chemicals essential to plant life, nitrogen nitric acid , potassium potassium hydroxide phosphorus phosphoric acid , the black liquor becomes a complete fertilizer in itself in addition to its retention properties.This can be readily achieved by using potassium hydroxide in the alkaline extraction step and by precipitating the ligneous component out of the extraction liquor by using phosphoric acid. Official government tests show normal germination and growth rates for barley and oats when this liquor is added to an inert clay. For easy handling, it can be combined with diatomaceous earth to inhibit hygroscopic properties.The acidified form of the black liquor, i.e. precipitant, can add its binding properties to such resins as melamine or phenolics permitting extension of these relatively expensive products. The neutral black liquor can be used in the preparation of resins since its nitrated form is com patible chemically with that of many other resins. The acidified black liquor precipitant may be resolubilized by changing the pH to 7.5 with alkali and then again precipitated with acid at pH 5.5 making possible the concentration of the ligneous component through precipitation and then resolubilizing for further use in a neutral form.During the alkaline extraction step most of the lignin nitrate dissolves in the alkaline solution, leaving the fibrous structure softened and partially defiberized. At this point the concentrated black liquor should be drained off for recycling or purging from the system as required. Since little mechanical and or explosive force has been exerted the point of fibre liberation will not have been reached under normal pulping conditions. Some of the ligneous component remains partially around the fibres, holding them together, but defibering can be readily accomplished by appropriate mechanical means, for example, by subjecting the softened structure to the action of a double disc defibrator or a deflaking unit, machines which will physically break apart the soft fibre bundles without causing substantial injury to the fibres themselves.It is preferable after mechanical defibering except for animal feed and semi chemical type pulps to wash the fibres with water to remove surface alkali and black liquor.Washing is preferably accomplished with a minimal amount of hot water e.g. at a temperature of about 85 to 1000C. The washing can be performed in any suitable manner. Following mechanical defibering and washing the cellulosic pulp can be subjected to a second nitration extraction sequence, as discussed above, or it can be used in any of the conventional ways to make cellulosic fibre webs.For pulps other than those intended for semi chemical board or animal feed it will be necessary to screen the pulp, to remove any fibre bundles that withstood the pulping process, which bundles can then be returned to the nitration step or further defibering action.Most commonly, the screened pulp will be supplied to the headbox of a paper machine, alone or in admixture with other types of fibres and there used to make paper products.In the previous text, substantial reference has been made to the processing of agricultural fibre residues, straw, bagasse into paper making fibres, using nitric acid as a nitrating agent, and aluminum sulphate alum . It is a feature of this invention which sets it apart from all previous experimentation with nitric acid, that in the case of fibrous structures ,such as straw,that both nitration and delignification can be accomplished in one step using a solution of neutral nitrate salts such as NaN03, NH4N03 or KN03 alkalized to a pH of about 11 to 12, e.g. 12, withNaOH, KOH, NH40H or other suitable alkali. The ease of nitration in this case is dictated by the open structure of these fibrous materials, particularly so after shredding, coupled with the relative thin form of grassy fibrous structures compared to even 0.5mm thin wood flakes, their low lignin content of 10 15 vs,25 35 for wood, and their low percentage of extraneous materials such as waxes and resins and other hydrophilic materials.As previously stated, previous art using nitric acid, a highly aggressive agent, has employed high usage and concentrations and lengthy time of treatment particularly for wood. The use of alum as an accelerator permits low consumption, low concentration and minimum processing time for woody fibrous structures in particular and grassy fibrous structures. The use of nitrate salts with their milder actions as opposed to the use of nitric acid plus alum is not practical for wood pulping and would not be economic for processing agricultural fibre residues, except for the possibility of combining the features of the process of this invention in providing controlled delignification, and the potential utilization of the black liquor as fertilizer, binder, sizing agent or resin extender.The process of delignification serves to dissociate the fibres making up the natural fibre structure freeing the lignin and providing fibres which can be formed into a web for production of paper or board. On a modified or reduced scale of delignification in a relatively dry state 50 moisture the lignin can be released in situ to act as a binder for the production of building board in which the fibrous structure remains essentially intact. Delignification will also increase the digestibility of fibrous structures by herbivores, cows and sheep etc. Animal feed is being produced commercially today from straw by addition of circa 5 NaOH to the dry weight of straw in a process which makes cubes or pellets with additional food additives.Additionally, work has been done with NH4OH, liquid or gaseous NH3, but this has not proven practical.Utilization of feed produced with NaOH is limited because the improvement in digestibility food value is low and the alkali content is high. An improvement to some 300 would be required to meet the food value of corn silage.Levels of improvement presently obtained processing straw are less than one tenth of this,and maximum utilitzation in the animals diet has not exceeded 15 .This invention provides a controlled method of delignification which increases digestibility to the point that the processed straw can comprise a minimum of 50 of the animals total diet. Mixed during processing with other food supplements, molasses, dried milk, etc a complete food can be formulated. Of equal importance is the potential of this process to be economic in small installations which further makes possible a joint production facility producing alternatively as required, animal feed and paper making fibre, providing flexibility to meet market demands local and long distance.It is characteristic of agricultural residues that they are bulky making it impossible to meet minimum weight requirements of shipping carriers resulting in high freight costs. Processing under this invention makes viable the production of a compact finished or semi finished product of high density which greatly reduces freight and handling cost.The alternative provided by this invention in accomplishing nitration and subsequent delignification of agricultural residues extend to choices of acidic nitric acid or a variety of neutral nitrate salts in nitration, various levels of chemical concentration varying time and temperature for both nitration and delignification steps and a choice of alkaline chemicals KOH, NaOH, NH40H to accomplish the pH level necessary for solution of the nitrated lignin.Consequently a variety of inexpensive mechanical installations for processing widely varied from present conventional pulping systems becomes not only possible but preferable. Schematic diagrams of two such possibilities are submitted as part of this invention. Figure 18, an ultra simple process involving a modified hydrapulper for the production of pulp for paper which would provide an economic and viable unit for production levels as low as 10 tons per day. Figure 19 shows a completely flexible unit for the production of animal feed and for paper pulp uti lizing hot air which could be derived from burning agricultural residues to achieve rapidly sufficient nitration temperatures 1000C and the drying of the end product to a specific moisture level, as necessary.The choice between the use of nitrate salts vs nitric acid would be dictated by economics 1 Twice as much salt would be necessary to achieve the same level of delignification as with nitric acid. 2 The reduced capital investment cost using salts since stainless steel would not be required for processing equipment. 3 The desired chemical content of the black liquor is provided, e.g.sodium ion built up in the soils if used for fertilizer would not be acceptable. 4 Differences in acceptability and digestibility by various animals digestive system or the chemical requirements required for further processing of the residual black liquor into sizing, binders or resin extenders.The ability to spray or foam the nitrating liquid on dry agricultural residues makes possible a process that is essentially dry and permits the leaching out of the nitrated lignin after the alkaline liquor is added by spray or foam an action that can follow immediately after the acid nitrating stage , when the moist mass 35 50 moisture is subjected to heat and pressure. Enough lignin is released to provide a hardened binding material base sufficient to bind the shredded straw when subjected to an appropriate hardening agent such as alum and the usual pressures and temperatures used in the manufacture of flake board from wood residues. In this way an inexpensive building board, water resistant and stiff can be made from straw by generating its own binding materials eliminating the use of expensive resins such as phenolics. Moreover, it was found that instead of aluminum sulphate other aluminum compounds can be used in the pulping process described hereinbefore and in the specification, claims and drawings of European Patent Application No.78 101 794.2, the total content of which is incorporated herein by reference.Examples for such aluminum compounds are aluminum chloride, aluminum oxides, such as Awl203 1 2 H2O, aluminum phosphates, aluminum nitrate, etc. These salts should be soluble in the aqueous nitric acid used in the pulping process.With aluminum chloride it is preferred to use a hydrated product or a hydrated product with additional water to avoid violent reactions when adding it to the pulping liquor. To avoid excessive hydrolysis of the aluminum chloride to aluminum hydroxide or oxide hydrate which must be redissolved later, nitric acid can be added.When using aluminum nitrate as starting material the introduction of foreign ions is avoided.The stated aluminum compounds should be used in amounts leading to similar aluminum ion concentrations in the pulping liquor as compared to the use of aluminum sulphate paper makers alum in the process described hereinbefore which alum is used in an amount of about 0.8 to 1.3 parts by weight per each 10 parts by weight of HNO3 100 . Comparing the molecular weights of the alum Al2 SO4 3 18 H2O 666 with, for example, Awl203 1 2 H2O 111 , it follows that for achieving the same aluminum ion concentration in the pulping liquor the aluminum oxide should be used in an amount of 1 6 compared to the alum. In terms of aluminum ion concentration or aluminum concentration this means that it should be from 0.065 to 0.105 parts by weight of aluminum ions per each 10 parts of HNO3 100 .While it has been noted that there is a minimum amount of aluminum ions to achieve a remarkable effect, e.g.0.01, 0.02, 0.03 or 0.04 parts by weight of aluminum ions per each 10 parts of HNO3, there is actually no strict upper limit, and the aluminum ion concentration could well go above 0.105, for example up to 0.15, 0.2, or even more.It has been found, however, that with exceeding a certain aluminum level no further advantage as to time reduction is obtained so that higher amounts are not desirable under economic and environmental pollution point of views.The perferred range is 0.065 to 0.105 parts by weight of aluminum ions per each 10 parts by weight of HNO3, a value of about 0.08 giving desirable results in the practice of the process of the invention.Besides reduction in process time, a further point of view is the inherent strength characteristics of the fiber obtained according to the process of the invention which characteristics can be influenced by the amount of aluminum. Thus, for every kind of ligno cellulosic material, e.g. bagasse or bamboo, the optimum amount of aluminum can vary depending on what reduction in process time and what fiber characteristics are demanded.The remaining proces parameters, e.g. the concentration of the nitric acid used, the seperation of the nitric acid from the nitrated ligno cellulosic material, the mechanical defibering or the treating of the nitrated ligno cellulosic material with an alkaline extraction liquor, etc. are the same as described hereinbefore and disclosed in the specification, claims and drawings ofEuropean patent application no. 78 101 794.2 the total content of which is incorporated herein by reference. The following examples are given as illustrations of the present invention although it is not intended that they limit its scope in any way a wide variety of conditions and changes in variables is shown to illustrate the flexibility of the system.Example 1Southern pine wood flakes, cut tangentially to the log circumference to a thickness of about 0.6mm, are continuously fed into a screw conveyor 10, as shown inFigure 1 attached hereto. The wood has a lignin content of about 35 wt. . The flakes are submerged and cooked in about six times their weight of a solution of 5 wt. nitric acid to which has been added aluminum sulphate in the ratio of 1 part aluminum sulphate to 10 parts HNO3 for a period of about 15 minutes at a temperature of about 950C. The slurry of flakes in acid is then fed into a spin 11 where the flakes are drained of the acid and then washed with a minimal amount of hot water. The drained excess acid and wash water are combined, fortified with alum and concentrated nitric acid as needed, and recycled for use in the initial nitration step.The flakes are then conducted to a storage vessel 12, from which they are fed into a screw conveyor 13 containing about six times their weight of a solution of about 1.5 wt. sodium hydroxide at a temperature of about 950C. There they are cooked for about 15 minutes. The flakes, partially defibered, are drained of the alkaline solution in which the ligning nitrate has dissolved for its recycling or purging by a spin dryer 14 then are put through a defibrator 15 in order to separate the fibres partially, following which they are washed in a rotary washer 16 with a minimal amount of hot water. The dilute black liquor that is drained off in the spin dryer 14 is recycled to the first extraction step. In order to obtain a product with a higher degree of cellulose purity,i.e., bleachable pulp, not necessary for linerboard grade pulp, the nitration and digestion ste can be repeated. To do so, the semi pulped flakes are fed into a screw conveyor 17 which contains about six times their weight of a solution of about 1.5 wt. nitric acid to which aluminium sulphate has been added in the ratio of about 1 part to 10 parts HNO3. There the semi pulped flakes are cooked for a period of about 15 minutes at a temperature of about 950C. The semi pulp is then drained of excess acid and washed with a minimal amount of hot water in a spin dryer 18. The drain acid and wash water are combined and recycled to the second nitration step.The semi pulp is then fed into a screw conveyor 19 which contains about six times its weight of a solution of about 0.8 wt. sodium hydroxide. The semi pulp is there cooked for about 10 minutes at a temperature of about 950C. The semi pulp is then drained of the excess alkaline solution black liquor in a high density press 20, after which it is fed into a defibrator 21 for additional defibering and finally washed in a rotary washer 22 with a minimal amount of hot water. The black liquor removed from the press 20 is partially recycled to the screw conveyor 19 for reuse, with the remaining portion being sent to waste disposal. The alkaline wash water from rotary washer 22 is also recycled to the second extraction step.The pulp leaving the rotary washer 22 has been almost completely delignified and defiberized. It is then screened by conventional screening equipment 23 to remove oversized particles which have not been defiberized, which are returned to the nitration step for reprocessing.Examples 2 7The process of Example 1 is repeated, using different ligno cellulosic raw materials, as indicated in the following Table III.In each example the nitric acid contains 1 part alum sulphate for each 10 parts of IIt3. The same applies for examples 8 through 14.In examples 4 through 7 the ligno cellulosic material is subjected to only one nitration extraction sequence.Example 8This example simulates the use of a sulphite digester producing bleachable pulp Kappa No. 8 using pressure under conditions as follows WOOD SPRUCE FORM FLAKES 0.5 0.6mm thick CHARGE 1.3kg DRY DIGESTER STATIONARY CIRCULATING IMPREGNATION TIME 15 MINUTES IMPREGNATION TEMPERATURE 700C IMPREGNATION CHEMICAL CON CENTRATION 5 HNO COOKING TIME 15 MINUTES TIME TO COOKING TEMPERATURE 2 MINUTES COOKING TEMPERATURE 85 950C COOKING CHEMICAL 7.5 HNt RATIO LIQUOR TO DRY WOOD 4 1 PRESSURE 7 22 P.S.I.G.
