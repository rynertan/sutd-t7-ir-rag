# HEAT EXCHANGER

## Abstract
A heat exchanger capable of use as a counter flow heat exchanger comprises a series of conduits for a first fluid, the conduits being arranged in panels that are spaced apart. The intervening spaces are traversed by a second fluid, and surface extending elements are located in such spaces, each surface extending element comprising a sheet from which portions have been pressed out to define a number of knuckles that are located in heat transmitting contact with a conduit panel on one side of the space. At least some of the knuckles may be secured to the conduit panel.
