# Burner for liquid fuel.

## Abstract
A liquid fuel burner for burning liquid fuel in the form of gaseous mixture with air. The liquid fuel burner has a porous member A provided at least with a fuel receiving section 1 for receiving the liquid fuel supplied to the burner and a fuel evaporation section 3 from which the liquid fuel is evapo rated. An air supplying device 11 is provided for forcibly supplying air to the fuel evaporation section 3 . The rate of air supply is variable by means of a damper 12 or the like means. Heating means 15 are provided for maintaining the fuel evaporation section 3 at a substantially constant temperature. The rate of burning is varied while maintaining the air fuel ratio of the mixture substantially constant because the rate of evaporation of fuel is almost in propor tion to the rate of supply of air to the fuel evaporation section 3 . The heating means 15 facilitates the evaporation of the fuel and permits a rapid rise and stabilization of the burning after the ignition.
