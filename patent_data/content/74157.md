# Optical data store.

## Abstract
A layer 6 of ion exchanger glass having stored energy in the form of compressive stress is utilized as an optical memory. When localized portions of the layer of ion exchanged glass are heated sufficiently, they soften and release the compressive stress energy to form localized, solid surface bumps 2 . The presence or absence of surface bumps provides binary data storage. Since the surface bumps scatter incident light differently from flat portions 4 of the glass surface, and since the glass is self supporting and rugged, the ion exchanged glass memory can provide high signal to noise ratio and archival storage. Such a data store is cheap because of its use of a readily available, low cost material i.e., glass, as the storage medium.

## Description
Optical data store Optical data stores have been proposed to overcome the data density limitations of magnetic memories. Conventional write once optical memories record binary data by an ablation process wherein localized portions of a thin film of memory material are vaporized by a focused, high energy light beam to provide voids in the film at locations corresponding to one of the binary values. Due to vaporization debris and other factors, the signal to noise ratio of ablative optical memories is low. Also, the film must be protectively encased if archival storage is contemplated since the film is too thin to be self supporting and acceptable film materials, such as tellurium, are very friable and corrosive. Accordingly, there is need for an optical memory that can provide the features of high signal to noise ratio and archival storage without protective encasement, as well as low cost of manufacture. According to the invention, a layer of an ion exchanged glass is utilized as an optical melnory. Due to the ion exchange, such glass possesses stored energy in the form of compressive stress. When localized portions of the layer of ion exchanged glass are heated suffidently, those portions of the glass soften and release the compressive stress energy in the form of localized, solid surface bumps.The presence or absence of surface bumps provides binary data storage.Since the surface bumps scatter light differently from flat portions of the glass surface, and since the glass is self supporting and rugged, the ion exchanged glass memory can provide the features of high signal to noise ratio and archival storage. An ion exchanged glass memory is inherently a low cost memory due to its use of a readily available, low cost material i.e., glass, as the storage medium. The present invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a perspective view of an optical memory in accordance with the invention Figure 2 is a graph showing depth of ion exchange layer as a function of tirnej Figure 3 shows the absorption spectra. of ion exchanged layerst and Figure 4 is a block diagram of a system for recording data on, and reading data from, the optical memory of the invention. Referring to Figure 1, binary data is stored in the form of small discrete, solid bumps 2 on the surface 4 of the ion exchanged surface layer portion 6 of a borosilicate glass containing an appropriate oxide modifier such as, for example, Corning Glass 7740 which is a borosilicate glass containing 4 mole percent sodium oxide Na2O as an oxide modifier. The ions of the oxide modifier of an acceptable glass are dispersed in a loose bonding arrangement within the glass lattice whereby the ions of the oxide modifier, sodium ions Na in the glass specified, are very mobile within the glass lattice. Since the oxioe modifier is added while the glass is molten, during its manufacture, the glass substrate 8 contains very little stored energy in the form of stress. A relatively large quantity of energy, in the form of compressive stress, is stored within the surface layer portion 6 v an ion exchange. Such an ion exchange is accomplished by exposing the substrate 8 to exchange ions that have a greater affinity for occupying lattice sites of the glass than do the ions of the modifier oxide. in a specific embodiment, copper ions Cu are made to exchange lattice sites with the sodium ions Na of the referenced borosilicate glass 7740, that is, sodium ions are mad to out difiuse or vacate lattice sites of the glass and those vacated lattice sites are occupied by copper ions. mDue to the copper ions having an atomic radiusO. 98no which is slightly m larger than the atomic radius of the sodium ions O.096n the ion cxchanged layer portion 6 contains stored energy in the form of compressive stress. The specified ion exchange is accomplished by immersing the 7740 glass in a molten bath of cuprous chloride for a period of time.Although the temperature of the bath is not critical, 5500 C being satisfactory, care must be taken not to vaporize the cuprous chloride since such vapors are toxic. The depth of the ion exchanged layer portion 6 is a square root function of the exchange time, that is, the time that the 7740 glass is in the bath. Specifically, d 2.094 Tt where d depth of layer 6 in microns and t time in molten bath in minutes. Figure 2 is a graph showing the depth in microns of the layer portion 6 as a function of exchange time in minutes for a 5500C bath. In Figure 1, an ion exchanged layer 6 is on only one side of the substrate due to appropriate masking during the bath or lapping thereafter, but an ion exchanged layer can be provided along both planar surfaces if it is desired to have a dual sided memory. In addition to storing energy in the form of compressive stress within layer portion 6, the ion exchange can also change the optical absorption spectra of layer portion 6. When CuCI and 7740 glass provide the ion exchanged layer 6, layer 6 is colored darkened and its optical absorptivity is increased. Curve A of Figure 3 is a plot of the absorption spectra of a layer of copper ion exchanged 7740 glass. Note that the ion exchanged layer has relatively good absorptivity at the blue end of the spectrum, the wavelength of the emission from conventionalArgon and Helium Cadmium lasers making such lasers acceptable sources of write beam energy for the ion exchanged glass memory disdosed. The increased optical absorptivity as compared to the glass prior to ion exchange permits a significant amount of write beam energy to be absorbed at discrete localized portions of the ion exchanged layer 6, with the heat resulting from that absorption softening, or making pliant, the ion exchanged layer at those discrete localized portions. The stored compressive stress energy pushes on the pliant heated portions, causing such portions to deform in the only direction available whereby small discrete surface protrusions or bumps 2 are formed. As noted, the 7740 glass contains 4 mole percent No 20. Borosilicate glasses containing an oxide modifier of higher content could be used and would provide additional advantages. First, such glasses would have a lower softening temperature, and thus require less write beam energy for glass softening and resultant release of compressive stress energy. Secondly, such glasses would provide more lattice sites for the exchange ions to occupy, thus increasing the absorptivity of such glass and further decreasing write beam energy requirements. The glass substrate can contain an oxide modifier other than sodium oxide. For example, the glass substrate could contain either potassium oxide or lithium oxide as an oxide modifier instead of sodium oxide, or a combination of two or more of the oxides. Cu K andCu Li ion exchanges would be achieved in substantially the same manner that a Cu Na ion exchange is achieved, however, a Cu Na ion exchange is preferred because Na ions out diffuse much better than either K ions or Li ions. Figure 4 depicts an exemp ary system for recording and reading of the bumps 2. An Argon laser 20, such as Lexel Model 95 4, ernits a coherent 488 nanometer light beam. The emitted light beam the write beam is directed by a mirror 22 onto a conventional electro optic modulator 24 with associated power supply 26, such as sold by CoherentAssociates, which function to amplitude modulate the write beam in accordance with data signals received in a conventional manner from a control processor 29, such as a 48K Apple II computer. Mirror 28 directs the modulated write beam onto a spatial filter 30 which deans up the write beam before it reaches a collimating lens 32 which recollimates and expands the beam spatial filter 30 having uncollimated the write beam . Polarizing beam splitter 34 polarizes and transmits the write beam, and quarter wavelength retarder plate 36 rotates the plane of the polarized beam to facilitate separation of the write and read beams as explained hereinafter. The diameter of the polarized write beam is regulated by the controlled aperture mernber 38, with the properly diametered write beam being directed by mirror 40 onto a lens 41 which focuses the write beam onto a discrete portion of the surface 4 of ion exchanged layer 6. Surface 4 of layer 6 is moved relative to the write beam along x and y coordinates by stepper motors 42 and 44 which are controlled in a conventional manner by stepping motor controls receiving appropriate inputs from the control processor 29. Accordingly, the write beam successively heats selected portions of the ion exchanged layer 6, resulting in the localized release of stored compressive stress energy and the formation of solid data bumps 2. Reading is accornplished by having laser 20, or another laser, emit a second beam the read beam , of lesser intensity than the write beam, along the path of the write beam. Light reflected from the surface of theion exchanged layer 6 is redirected by mirror 40 to the quarter wavelength retarder plate 36 which rotates the read beam an additional quarter wavelength so that it is now reflected not transmitted by the polarizing beam splitter 34. Photodetector 50 reads the intensity of the read beam reflected from the surface of ion exchange layer 6, the read beam being processed through a variable aperture 39 positioned forward of the photodetector 50 in order to shield the detector from stray light. Photodetector 50 with associated amplifier 52 reads the degree of reflectivity of each discrete portion of the ion exchanged layer 6 on which the read beam falls. When the read beam is incident upon a bump 2, the read beam is scattered by the bump and light of low intensity reaches the photodetector 50. Flat portions of the surface of the ion exchanged layer 6 do not scatter the read beam and, accordingly, light of relatively high intensity reaches the photodetector 50. Thus, the binary value of the information on the bumped surface of the ion exchanged layer 6 is detected in binary by the photodetector 50. The amplified output of photodetector 50 is coupled to the control processor 29 to coordinate in a conventional manner the ooordinates of each portion of the ion exchanged layer illuminated by the write beam with the intensity of the signal received from photodetector 50 for those coordinates. The size of bumps 2 is dependent upon several factors including the compressive stress energy of layer 6, the optical absorptivity of layer 6, and the power and pulse length of the write beam. Using copper ion exchanged 7740 glass produced by immersing 7740 glass in a molten 5500C copper chloride bath for 1320 minutes and an Argon laser emission at 488 nm operated to deliver one 1 microsecond pulses of 30 milliwatts at the surface of layer 6, bumps 2 are formed with a diameter of about 2.25 microns and a height of about 0.3 0.5 microns. Bumps of such size are formed when the lens 41 is a conventional 10 power microscope objective. Smaller diameter bumps, on the order of 0.5 microns, are formed when the lens 41 is of higher power, 60X being typical. The relatively large height of the bumps 2 provides effective read beam scattering and a resultant high signal to noise ratio compared to that of optical memories using ablated tellurium. Also, since the data are stored as a part solid surface bumps of an extremely rugged material glass , archival storage is readily achieved without need for protective encasement. Additionally, since the memory medium is an extremely inexpensive material, a very low cost optical memory is provided. Although superior to ablated tellurium as an optical memory in several aspects, the ion exchanged optical memory disclosed requires rnore energy for data storage than does a memory utilizing ablated tellurium. For example, it typically requires on the order of 0.25 nanojoules of energy to ablate tellurium and 30 nanojoules of energy to form burnps 2. The data storage energy requirements of a copper ion exchanged optical memory layer can be reduced by hydrogen reduction wherein a hydrogen containing gas, such as forming gas 80 nitrogen, 20 hydrogen is caused to flow over a heated 4000 C ion exchanged optical memory layer for a period of time from one to several hours directly proportional to the thickness of the ion exchanged optical memory layer. The hydrogen flow causes the copper ions to become minute partides of metallic copper Cu . The presence of metallic copper in the ion exchanged layer increases the absorptivity of the ion exchanged layer, as shown by curves a and C of Figure 3 for hydrogen reduction times of one and six hours, respectively. The increased absorptivity of the ion exchanged layer reduces the amount of write beam energy needed to soften discrete portions of the ion exchanged layer to the point where the compressive stress energy of those discrete portions is released as bumps 2. As an example, when a sample of 7740 glass has been CuCI ion exchanged for 15 minutes at 5500 C and then subsequently reduced in forming gas for 45 minutes at 4000C bumps can be formed with write beam energies of less than one I nanojoule. This occurs when lens 41 is a 60X, .85N.A. objective. Although an ion exchange between copper ions and ions of sodium, potassium or lithium will provide an effective optical memory material, the use of copper as a source of exchange ions cause the mernory material to have some inherent limitations. Specifically, the wavelength of the laser beam used for recording data on a Cu Na exchange material is restricted to the blue end of the spectrum since, as indicated by curve A of Figure 3, a Cu Na exchange material has very low optical absorptivity at wavelengths substantially greater than 488 nanometers. Also, since Cu ions are not much larger than Na ions, the absolute amount of stored compressive stress energy is relatively low.Increased optical absorptivity at wavelengths in excess of 488 nanometers can be achieved by utilizing glass color filters, such asSchott Bis38 and BC 18, as the glass substrate 8. Significant optical absorptivity in the far red end of the spectrum 800 950 nanometers would allow the use of diode lasers as the write beam source. Increased stored compressive stress energy can be achieved by utilizing exchange ions that have a much larger atomic radius than do the oxide modifier iors. For example, utilizing potassium ions as the exchange ions with a glass containing sodium oxide as the oxide modifier will provide a relatively large amount of compressive stress energy since potassium ions are much larger than sodium ions. In a manner similar to a Cu Na ion exchange, a K Na ion exchange would be achieved by immersing a sodium oxide modified glass in a rnolten bath of a potassium salt, such as KC1.
