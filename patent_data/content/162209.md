# A process for hardening elongate metal elements.

## Abstract
A process for hardening elongate metal elements having a circular section, according to which the said elements 2 are made to advance through a heating station 7 and a hardening station 8 by a conveyer device 9 formed by a succession of advancement and support devices 17 indi vidually controllable in a direction transverse the said ele ments 2 in such a way as to maintain the axis of each of the elements 2 always coincident with a predetermined axis of advancement 72 each advancement device 72 being individually controllable in such a way as to impart to each point of each element 2 displacements with a controllable velocity along cylindrical helices the pitch of which can be varied from zero to infinity and, in particular, to impart to each element 2 , during the traverse through a current of cooling fluid generated within the said hardening station 8 transversely of the axis of advancement 72 , a rotary and translational movement with a velocity variable according to laws depending on the distribution of mass along the element 2 itself.
