# Electric terminals having plated interior surfaces, apparatus for and method of selectively plating said terminals.

## Abstract
The apparatus 1, 1 is characterised in that a mandrel 3, 3 is rotated continuously as a strip of electrical terminals 15, 15 are continuously fed to the mandrel 3, 3 , partially wrapped against the mandrel 3, 3 , and exited from the mandrel 3, 3 . A conduit 36, 36 for supplying plating fluid 48, 48 under pressure opens into a plurality of nozzles 26, 26 on the mandrel 3, 3 . Anode extensions 29, 29 are mounted within the nozzles 26, 26 for reciprocation into and out of the interiors of the terminals 15, 15 that are against the mandrel 3, 3 . The nozzles 26, 26 inject plating solution into the interiors of those terminals 15, 15 in which the anode extensions 29, 29 have been received. A source of electrical potential supplies electrical current flowing from the anode extensions 29, 29 through the plating solution 48, 48 and to the interiors of those terminals 15, 15 having anode extensions 29, 29 therein. The anode extensions 29, 29 are constructed for withdraw al from the interiors of those terminal 15, 15 prior to those terminals exiting from the mandrel 3, 3 . A method for selectively plating the interior surfaces of electrical terminals 15, 15 and a series of terminals plated according to the invention are also disclosed.
