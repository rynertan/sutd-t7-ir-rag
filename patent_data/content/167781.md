# Two stages colleting in a flexible disk drive.

## Abstract
Two stage colleting is disclosed for a flexible disk drive. Precise registration of a floppy disk within a disk cartridge with respect to the spindle 20 and recording head 39 of a disk drive is achieved by first positioning the cartridge with respect to the collet 19 , and then aligning the collet with respect to the spindle axis as the collet is moved toward the spindle. This is two stage colleting is made possible by use of a collet shaft having two different diameters 24, 25 with the larger diameter being adjacent to the collet during position ing of the cartridge with respect to the collet and with the smaller diameter being adjacent to the collet to allow movement of the collet in a direction normal to the spindle axis during alignment of the collet with respect to the spindle axis.
