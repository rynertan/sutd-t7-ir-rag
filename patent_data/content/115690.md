## Description
This invention relates to certain dibenzocycloheptenylidenes to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to the use of such dibenzocycloheptenylidenes in treating inflammation in mammals. In the treatment of chronic inflammatory conditions, both steroidal and nonsteroidal drugs have been extensively used. The use of corticosteroid therapy in rheumatoid arthritis for example, while providing symptomatic relief, has not been shown actually to improve prognosis and prolonged therapy is attended by serious side effects, such as increased susceptibility to infection, peptic ulceration and development of osteoporosis. The non steroidal anti inflammatory agents, such as the salicylates, indomethacin, phenylbutazone, gold salts and the like, are also used in the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases, especially rheumatoid arthritis. The non steroidal drugs have a suppressive effect on the antigen antibody reactions which are causative factors in the inflammatory process, and also have effects on the synthesis or release of prostaglandins, the complement system, lymphocyte transformations and so forth. However, as with the steroids, these antiinflammatory agents, when used steadily to control chronic inflammatory conditions, have serious side effects.The most serious is gastric intolerance, which severely limits the use of these agents in peptic ulcer patients.Moreover, phenylbutazone can cause bone marrow depression.Thus, the most widely used non steroidal anti inflammatory agents have some serious side effects which limit their usefulness in the treatment of chronic inflammatory conditions. In our GB Patent 2071098 we have described pharmaceutical compositions containing dibenzocycloheptenylidene compounds of formula AEMI2.1 Where R is hydrogen or an alkyl group of 1 4 carbon atoms, Rt is hydrogen or an alkyl group of 1 4 carbon atoms or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The compounds of formula A have anti flammatory activity and are useful in the treatment of anti f lammatory conditions, especially chronic conditions with little or no secondary effects. We have now found that by modifying the molecule of compounds of formula A further anti inflammatory agents are obtained which have considerable value in the treatment of inflammatory conditions, expecially chronic conditions, with little or no secondary effects. The invention is directed to compounds of the formula EMI2.2 wherein R4 is hydrogen or chloro, R5 is carboxy, an ester thereof or tetrazolyl, R2 is hydrogen, halo or alkoxy of 1 4 carbon atoms, and R is hydrogen or bromo, with the proviso that when R4 is hydrogen and R5 is carboxy then Rê or R is other than hydrogen and that when R R2 and R3 are all hydrogen, R5 is tetrazolyl the stereoi somers thereof and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. The invention is also directed to the use of compounds of formula B wherein R is carboxy or tetrazolyl as pharmaceuticals eg. as anti flammatory agents. The halo group R2 is preferably fluoro, chloro or bromo. When R4 is chloro preferably R5 is carboxy andRê and R are hydrogen. The compounds of formula B can be prepared by various methods all of which are included in the invention. One method comprises treating a compound of formula DEMI3.1 wherein R2 and R3 are as defined above in known manner to 4 the group R4 R 5 wherein 4 and 5 introduce the group R C R wherein R4 and R5 are as defined in connection with formula B and if desired converting the product to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. Compounds of Formula B wherein R is carboxy may be prepared by hydrolysis of the corresponding carboxylic esters. Compounds of Formula B wherein R5 is tetrazolyl may be prepared by a process in which a compound ofFormula CEMI4.1 wherein Rê, R and R4 are as defined above and Q is a group containing an unsaturated C N linkage, is reacted with other known compounds to form a tetrazole ring system and thus a product B wherein R5 is tetrazolyl and if desired the product is converted to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. Thus a compound of Formula C wherein Q is CN orC NH wherein G is a halogen atom or an alkoxy group isG reacted with an alkali metal azide or ammonium azide to obtain a compound of formula B wherein R5 is tetrazolyl and if desired the product is converted to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. The compounds of formula B can be prepared according to the following reaction sequence EMI5.1 EMI6.1 In this sequence, diethyl 2 cyanophenyl methyl3phosphonate is reacted with a suitably substituted benzaldehyde in the presence of a metal alkoxide, such as sodium methoxide in a solvent such as dimethylformamide. The resultant intermediate I is reduced to yield intermediate it . This benzonitrile is hydrolyzed to the corresponding carboxylic acid III , which is then subjected to ring closure to yield the intermediate 10,11ç dihydro dibenzocyclohepten 5 one IV . The latter is treated with N bromosuccinimide in carbon tetrachloride followed by treatment with a metal alkoxide in organic solvent to yield the dibenzocyclohepten 5 one V .The intermediate is reacted with a trialkyl phosphonoalkanoate and an alkali metal alkoxide eg. potassium t butoxide in an organic solvent, to yield the esters VI of the desired acids , a mixture of Eand Z isomers when R2 is other than hydrogen . The racemic mixture is separated using high pressure liquid chromatography HPLC to yield the separate E and Z isomers VII , which may then be saponified with a base and the resultant final products VIII recovered as salts or as the free acids. Alternatively, the intermediate V can be subjected to a Reformatsky reaction or a modified Reformatsky reaction using lithium salts of a lithiocarboxylic acids to yield the intermediate VI . The compounds in which R4 is chloro and R5 and R2 are both hydrogen can be prepared by a variation of the above described reaction sequence. The intermediate IV in which R2 is hydrogen, is reacted with a trialkyl phosphonoalkanoate and a metal alkoxide, such as potassium t butoxide to yield an alkyl i0,11 dihydro dibenzocyclo hepten 5 ylidene acetate. The latter is reacted with chlorine in carbon tetrachloride to yield the 5,a dichloro derivative, which is treated with a metal alkoxide, such as potassium t butoxide in tetrahydrofuran to yield the a chloro derivative.The latter is then treated with Nbromosuccinimide in carbon tetrachloride fdllowed by treatment with triethylamine to yield an alkyl a chlorodibenzocyclohepten 5 ylidene acetate, which may then be saponified with a base and the desired final product achloro derivative is recovered as a salt or as the free acid. When it is desired to prepare the compound in which R5 is tetrazolyl, the intermediate V in which R2 is hydrogen, may be reacted with a dialkyl cyanomethyl phosphonate and a metal alkoxide, such as potassium tbutoxide, to yield dibenzocyclohepten 5 ylidene acetonitrile, which is reacted with sodium azide and ammonium chloride in organic solvent to yield the desired dibenzocyclohepten 5 ylidenemethyl tetrazole. The compound 5H dibenzo a,d cyclohepten 5 one, which is used as a starting material in some of the outlined reaction sequences, can be prepared according to the method of W.Treibs and H.J. Klinkhammer, Chem. Ber., 84, 671 1951 or it can be obtained commercially. The compounds of the invention in which theR2 substituent is other than hydrogen exist as conformational isomers. As indicated supra, the racemic mixture of the E and Z isomers may be separated into the individual component isomers by use of high pressure liquid chromatography. While in all cases the racemic mixtures of formula B wherein R5 is carboxy or tetrazolyl exhibit anti inflammatory activity, generally the E isomer exhibits greater activity than Z isomer. For example, the E isomer of 3 chloro 5H dibenzo a,d cyclohepten 5 ylidene acetic acid is several times more active than itsZ isomer. Accordingly, in some of the compounds of the invention, the unresolved racemic mixtures and individual isomers are both active anti inflammatory agents. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the free acid wherein R5 is carboxy or tetrazolyl include the sodium, potassium, ammonium, and lower alkylamine salts, which are prepared and isolated by conventional methods. The compounds of formula B wherein R5 is carboxy or tetrazolyl are anti inflammatory agents having significant oral activity in the treatment of inflammation.These compounds do not act by stimulating the steroids naturally occurring in mammals, and since these compounds additionally have a lack of general pharmacological activity, they are of particular use in the long term treatment of chronic inflammatory conditions, which, for example, are present in rheumatoid arthritis and other connective tissue disorders. When the compounds of the invention are employed as anti inflammatory agents, they can be formulated into oral dosage forms such as tablets, capsules and the like.The compounds can be administered alone or by combining them with conventional carriers, such as magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar, lactose, pectin, dextrin, starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, low melting wax, cocoa butter, and the like. Diluents, flavouring agents, solubilizers, lubricants, suspending agents, binders, tablet disintegrating agents and the like may be employed. The compound may be encapsulated with or without other carriers. In all cases the proportion of active ingredients in said compositions both solid and liquid will be at least sufficient to impart anti inflammatory activity thereto on oral administration.The compounds may also be injected parenterally, in which case they are used in the form of a sterile solution containing other solutes, for example, enough saline or glucose to make the solution isotonic. The dosage requirements vary with the particular compositions employed, the route of administration, the severity of the symptoms presented and the particular subject being treated. Treatment will generally be initiated with small dosages less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached. In general, the compounds of the invention are most desirably administered at a concentration level that will generally afford effective results without causing any harmful or deleterious side effects.With large animals about 70kg. body weight , for oral administration the dose is from about 1,0 milligrams to about 300 milligrams and preferably from about 10 milligrams to about 200 milligrams per day either as a single unit dose, or if desired, the dosage may be divided into convenient subunits administered at specified times throughout the day. The anti inflammatory effects of the compounds of the invention may be demonstrated by standard pharmacological procedures, which are described more fully in the examples given hereinafter. These procedures illustrate the ability of the compounds of the invention to exert an anti flammatory effect by directly measuring the effect of the compounds in the rat carrageenan edema test, and the rat adjuvant arthritis test.

The results show that E 3 chloro 5H dibenzo a,dl cyclohepten 5 ylidene acetic acid and 3 fluoro SH dibenzo a,d cyclohepten 5 ylidene acetic acid mixture of isomers inhibit carrageenan paw edema at oral doses of 20 200 mg kg, which is a more significant reduction in the acute inflammatory response than that attained by aspirin. Example 11The ability of the compounds of the invention to inhibit immunologic induced chronic inflammation is tested in adjuvant arthritis daily dosing assay.Polyarthritis is induced in groups of 6 10 SpragueDawley rats weighing between 180 220 g. by a subcutaneous injection into the right paw of dessicatedMycobacterium butyricum or tuberculosis 0.5 mg 0.1 ml suspended in light mineral oil. Compounds of the invention, aspirin and indomethacin are administered orally in 0.5 methylcellulose using a daily regimen except for weekends . Both hind paw volumes ml. are measured by mercury plethysmograph on day 0 or at the time of injection of the complete adjuvant. Increases in paw volume viz. edema are determined for the left paw on day 16. Statistical analysis of differences in paw edemas is performed by using the unpaired, Student s t test. The results are summarised in Table 2. Table 2Compound of Oral Dose Change of Left PawExample No. mg kg Edema at Day 16 1G. Z isomer 25 28 1H. E isomer 25 59 2H.

The estimatedED50 of indomethacin in this test is 0.9 mg kg. and that of aspirin has been assessed at approximately 140 mg kg. Thus, the compounds of the invention show significant anti inflammatory activity in the adjuvent arthritis test.
