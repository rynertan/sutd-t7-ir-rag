# IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO METHODS OF MANUFACTURING A FOODSTUFF PRECURSOR AND OR FOODSTUFFS MANUFACTURED THEREBY

## Abstract
A method of manufacturing a foodstuff or a foodstuff precursor, said method comprising steps of forming a liquid protein composition with the desired ingredients, modifying the protein using a coagulating enzyme but without allowing coagulation, passing the liquid so modified along a flow path while adjusting the pH and heating the liquid to cause coagulation of the protein into small curd centres within the flow, separating the coagulated protein from the remainder of the liquid, mixing the coagulated protein with additives, if any, and forming the resultant mix into a foodstuff or foodstuff precursor. If the product is a foodstuff precursor it can be admixed with other foodstuffs and or additives to give rise to a resultant foodstuff.
