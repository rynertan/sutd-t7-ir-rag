# Thermocouple vacuum gauge.

## Abstract
A thermocouple pressure gauging system for measur ing partial vacuum is provided which uses time multiplexing to alternately heat the thermocouple to constant temperature and then measure the EMF from thermocouple with heating current off. A signal proportional to pressure is derived from the heating duty cycle. The pressure signal is in turn used to derive a reference signal which is compared to the EMF from the thermocouple to control the heating of the thermocouple.
