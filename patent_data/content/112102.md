# High temperature stable crosslinked gel fracturing fluid.

## Abstract
A fracturing fluid for fracturing subterranean formations penetrated by a well bore, comprises an aqueous fluid, a gelling agent, a crosslinking agent comprising a sirconium chelate or an aluminium chelate, and a sufficient quantity of carbon dioxide to reduce the pH of the fracturing fluid to a level below about 5.5. The fluid is injected into the formation through the well at a rate and pressure sufficient to create at least one fracture in the formation.
