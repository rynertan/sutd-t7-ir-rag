# Microcomputer with interprocess communication.

## Abstract
A microcomputer comprises memory 13, 19 and CPU 12 . Communication channels 50 53, 61, 63 are provided to permit data transmission from an outputting process X to an inputting process Y in response to input and output instruc tions. The channels are single word locations 50 53 in mem ory or registers 61, 63 in serial links 25 arranged to hold values which ensure that data transmission occurs when both processes are at corresponding stages in their program sequ ence. CPU 12 requires only one input or output instruction in a process program in order to effect data transmission.
