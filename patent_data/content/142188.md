# Signal dropout correction circuit for correcting video signals disturbed by signal dropouts.

## Abstract
A dropout correction circuit is described. It comprises a dropout detector 10 , which compares a signal with a refer ence level and controls a switch 5 which connects an output of the circuit to a line memory 1 , in order to insert a corres ponding part of a preceding line during such a dropout. In order to enable the reference level to be selected as high as possible the colour carrier is extracted before the video signal is applied to the dropout detector.
