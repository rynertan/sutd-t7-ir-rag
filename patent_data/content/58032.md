# Radar arrangements.

## Abstract
A portable security unit operating by radar has an antenna 20 mounted at a predetermined distance above the ground which emits an FM CW signal having a carrier frequency in the range 1 2 GHz for example. Reflections from moving targets are sensed and processed with a signal at the transmitted frequency to obtain the second harmonic of the modulation frequency from which in turn the Doppler frequency component is extracted and its amplitude, which varies with range as a second order Bessel function, is measured. The second order Bessel component has a low amplitude for targets near to the unit, thereby minimising false alarms from birds and the like. The amplitude of this component is also attenuated beyond a predetermined distance from the unit and this, in conjunction with attenuation caused by interference between direct and reflected transmitted waves which is arranged to occur beyond the same distance, prevents unwanted echoes from targets outside the desired range of the unit.
