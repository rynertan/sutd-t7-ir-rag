## Description
This invention relates to the application of recombinant DNA technology for the production of hepatitis B surface antigen HB This invention provides for particular expression vectors that utilize DNA sequences for replication, phenotypic selection and linking to the hepatitis B surface antigen HBsAg gene and expression promoter therefor which sequences are natural to and or not detrimental in the host vertebrate cell system employed. The HBsAg is secreted into the culture medium in particle form of about 22 nm and contains antigenic determinant s of hepatitis B virus HBV . The thus produced hepatitis B surface antigen is suitable for use in the preparation of vaccines against hepatitis B virus and this invention also relates to the means and methods of converting the end product HBsAg of such cell culture expression to entities, such as vaccines, useful against HBV. The publications and other materials hereof used to illuminate the background of the invention, and in particular cases, to provide additional details respecting its practice are incorporated herein by reference, and for convenience, are numerically referenced in the following text and grouped in the appended bibliography, With the advent of recombinant DNA technology, the controlled microbial production of an enormous variety of useful polypeptides has become possible, Many vertebrate polypeptides, such as human growth hormone, human proinsulin, desacetylthymosin alpha 1, human and hybrid leukocyte interferons, human fibroblast interferon, as well as a number of other products have already been produced by various microorganisms. The power of the technology admits the microbial production of an enormous variety of useful polypeptides, putting within reach the microbially directed manufacture of hormones, enzymes, antibodies, and vaccines useful for a wide variety of drug targetting applications. A basic element of recombinant DNA technology is the plasmid, an extrachromosomal loop of double stranded DNA found in bacteria oftentimes in multiple copies per cell. Included in the information encoded in the plasmid DNA is that required to reproduce the plasmid in daughter cells i.e., a replicon or origin of replication and ordinarily, one or more phenotypic selection characteristics, such as resistance to antibiotics, which permit clones of the host cell containing the plasmid of interest to be recognized and preferentially grown in selective media. The utility of bacterial plasmids lies in the fact that they can be specifically cleaved by one or another restriction endonuclease or restriction enzyme , each of which recognizes a different site on the plasmid DNA. Thereafter heterologous genes or gene fragments may be inserted into the plasmid by endwise joining at to the cleavage site or at reconstructed ends adjacent to the cleavage site. Thus formed are so called replicable expression vehicles. DNA recombination is performed outside the host organism, and the resulting recombinant replicable expression vehicle, or plasmid, can be introduced into the cells of organisms by a process known as transformation and large quantities of the recombinant vehicle obtained by growing the transformant. Moreover, when the gene is properly inserted with reference to portions of the plasmid which govern the transcription and translation of the encoded DNA message, the resulting expression vehicle can be used to direct the production of the polypeptide for which the inserted gene codes, a process referred to as expression. Expression is initiated in a DNA region known as the promoter. In the trancription phase of expression, the DNA unwinds, exposing it as a template for initiated synthesis of messenger RNA from the DNA sequence. The messenger RNA is, in turn, bound by ribosomes where the messenger RNA is translated into a polypeptide chain having the amino acid sequence encoded by the mRNA. Each amino acid is encoded by a nucleotide triplet or codon which collectively make up the structural gene , i .e., that part of the DNA sequence. which encodes the amino acid sequence of the expressed polypeptide product. Translation is initiated at a start signal ordinarily ATG, which in the resulting messenger RNA becomes AUG . So called stop codons define the end of translation, and hence of the production of further amino acid units. The resulting product may be obtained by lysing, if necessary, the host cell, in microbial systems, and recovering the product by appropriate purification from other proteins. In practice, the use of recombinant DNA technology can express entirely heterologous polypeptides so called direct expression or alternatively may express a heterologous polypeptide fused to a portion of the amino acid sequence of a homologous polypeptide. In the latter cases, the intended bioactive product is sometimes rendered bioinactive within the fused, homologous heterologous polypeptide until it is cleaved in an extracellular environment. See British Patent Publ. No. 2007676A and Wetzel, If recombinant DNA technology is to fully sustain its promise, systems must be devised which optimize expression of gene inserts, so that the intended polypeptide products can be made available in controlled environments and in high yields. The art of cell or tissue cultures for studing genetics and cell physiology is well established. Means and methods are in hand for maintaining permanent cell lines, prepared by successive serial transfers from isolate normal cells. For use in research, such cell lines are maintained either on a solid support in liquid medium, or by growth in suspension containing support nutriments. Scale up for large preparations seems to pose only mechanical problems. For further background, attention is directed to The present invention is directed to means and methods of producing in vertebrate cell culture, hepatitis B surface antigen HBsAg in discrete particle form comprising immunogenic determinant s of hepatitis B virus HBV . The HBsAg hereof is secreted into the cell culture medium in discrete particle form, devoid of any additional, fused polypeptide artifact, whether encoded by another portion of the HBV genome or by DNA homologous to the vector employed. This invention contemplates the use of the thus produced HBsAg for the preparation of vaccines useful to confer immunogenicity to HBV in susceptible humans, to such vaccines and to the method of using them to inoculate and confer immunogenicity to HBV in susceptible humans. Hepatitis B serum hepatitis virus is transmitted among humans and manifests as chronically debilitating infections which can result progressively in severe liver damage, primary carcinoma and death. In most cases, complete recovery from hepatitis B infections can be expected however, large segments of the population, especially in any African and Asian countries, are chronic carriers with the dangerous potential of transmitting the disease pandemically. Hepatitis is caused by a virus vector hepatitis B virus or HBV which in its whole state the so called Dane particle represents the virion and consists of a 27nm nucleocapsid enclosing a DNA molecule and an envelope surrounding the nucleocapsid. Proteins associated with the virion include the core antigen HBcAg , a DNA polymerase and the surface antigen HBsAG which has been found in serum of infected and carrier humans. Antibodies to HBsAG have also been found in serum HBV infected poeple. It is believed that HBsAG is the HBV antigen that can induce immunogenic production of antibody anti HBs and thus it would be the principle in an HBV vaccine. Attention is directed to Dane HBsAg is present in infected plasma predominantly in the form of spherical particles having diameters ranging from about 16 to 25 nm the so called 22 nm particle, These are thought to represent a noninfectious viral envelope. Because antibodies against HBsAg are protective against HBv infection, these non infectious particles can effectively be used as a vaccine. Inasmuch as the hepatitis B virus has not been infectious in cell culture and can only be obtained from infected humans or higher primates, means have not been available for obtaining and maintaining sufficient supplies of HBV for use in producing antigen for immunization against HBV. In British Patent Application Publication No. 2034323A and European Patent Applications Publications Nos, 13828 and 20251 are respectively described the isolation and cloning of the HBV genome, the expression of HBV core antigen and the production in Moriarty Further, their construction incorporated the HBsAg DNA in frame with the VP 2 protein coding sequence of SV40 virus. It is not clear whether nature HBsAg was expressed. Some preferred embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 depicts the construction of plasmid pSVR containing SV40 DNA with a deletion of the coding region for the VP 1 protein. Figure 2 depicts the construction of plasmid pHS94 harboring HBsAg DNA. Figure 3 depicts the construction of plasmid pSVHBSA containing HBsAg DNA and sequences of DNA derived from SV40 and pBR322.

Monolayers of Cos cells were grown to 50 60 percent confluency in 6 cm plastic dishes. The cells were washed with Dulbecco s modified medium, and 2 ml of medium containing 1 µg of plasmid DNA and DEAE dextran at 200 µg was applied for 12 hours at 37 . The DNA solution was removed, the cells washed once with medium, and 5 ml of medium containing 10 percent fetal calf serum was added and the cells incubated at 37 for either one or three days prior to DNA extraction. At these times, small supercoiled plasmid DNA was isolated according to the method of Hirt 14 . The DNA was subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose 15 . To visualize replicating plasmids, the nitrocellulose filter was probed With P32 labelled HBV DNA. Lanes a DNA from Hirt lysates of cells transfected With pRI Bgl .

Monolayers of Cos cells here grown to approximately 50 percent confluency in 6 cm plastic dishes, and prepared for DNA transfection as described in Figure 4. 2 ml of Dulbecco s modified medium containing 10 percent fetal calf serum was added following transfection, and the medium assayed at various times for HBsAg expression following 24 hours accumulation. HBsAg expression is expressed as counts per minute cpm In 0.2 ml undiluted medium, as assayed by RIA Abbott Labs . Figure 6 depicts immunogenicity of HBsAg derived from monkey cells. Medium from 20 15 cm dishes of Cos cells transfected with pHBs348 L was harvested and HbsAg purified as described above for electron microscopic examination. Three groups of five mice were immunized with 2.8 µg, 0.6 µg, or D.006 µg of purified HBsAg In the presence of complete Freund s adjuvant. Control mice were immunized with similar amounts of authentic HBsAg derived from human serum North American Biologicals Inc. Mice were tail bled at various times following immunization, anti HBsAg antibody quantitated by RIA Abbott Labs , and the results expressed as the average titer per mouse. Mice immunized with HBsAg derived from tissue culture developed titers identical to mice immunized With HBsAg derived from human serum. Figure 7 demonstrates the presence of HBV sequences replicating as part of SV40. Figure 8A depicts a sucrose gradient sedimentation of HBsAg synthesized via the recombinant vector hereof. Figure 8B is a corresponding CsCl gradient centrifugation thereof. Figure 9 depicts an electron micrograph of HBsAg synthesized as a 22nm particle in accordance with this invention. Propagation of vertebrate cells in culture tissue culture has become a routine procedure In recent years see In addition, the replication of SV40 DNA begins unique site and proceeds bidirectionally 19 . Genetic evidence indicates that only one viral gene product is required for the replication of the viral DNA. This is the product of the A gene T antigen . which is required to initiate each round of viral DNA synthesis 12 . Experiments described herein have demonstrated that recombinant plasmids containing the origin of DNA replication of SV40 are able to replicate in monkey cells in the presence of SV40 T antigen 20. 21 . It was desired to construct vectors which preserved both replication and promoter functions. That such a system can be employed to express heterologous genes in the absence of a complementing helper virus also has been established. The expression vectors hereof effectively direct the synthesis of mature HBsAg, inter alia in the COS 7 The complete nucleotide sequence of SV40 DNA is known 1 . therefore, the physical locations of various SV40 coded proteins can be correlated directly with various restriction enzyme cleavage sites. Examination of the nucleotide sequence encompassing the coding region of VP 1 protein 1 indicated two well placed restriction endonuclease cleavage sites. Fig. 1 . The first is a cleavage site of restriction endonuclease pBR322 through There are two purposes for the addition of synthetic decanucleotide, First, the added decanucleotide contains a cleavage site for restriction endonuclease Eight µg of For converting the Hind III site cohesive end to the After the ligated DNA was treated with restriction endonuclease The above constructed SV40 vector was designed to express the gene encoding the surface antigen of hepatitis B virus HBsAg . The HBsAg, a polypeptide of 25,000 molecular weight, normally exists as a complex particulate structure 22 nm particle which is partly glycosylated and is secreted to the exterior of the infected liver cell 6 . For expressing HBsAg in the above constructed SV40 vector, an ideal DNA fragment containing the coding sequence of HBsAg would conform to the following conditions. First, this DNA has The structural gene coding for the HBsAg was recovered from a plasmid pHBV T 1A containing the entire genome of HBV cloned into the EcoRI site of pBR322. This clone was obtained by methods similar to those recently published by Valenzuela The structural gene was modified in two ways 1 to incorporate a unique restriction site directly in front of the initial ATG methionine codon and 2 to blunt end ligate the HBV Hpa 1 site located distal to the HBsAg gene to the filled in EcoRI site of pBR322. These two modifications to the DNA fragment containing the HBsAg structural gene were accomplished as described below 1. 50 µg of pHBV T IA DNA was first digested with Hpa II 80 units in 200 µl reaction mixture according to enzyme supplier s BRL reaction condition to obtain a 1.7 kb DNA fragment, in which the initiation codon for the coding sequences of HBsAg was located close to the 5 end of the sense strand about 400 bp . The DNA was purified by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels PAGE . The purified HpaII fragment was then treated with λ exonuclease 2 units in 100 µl reaction mixture New England BioLab for 30 minutes at 37 c. λ exonuclease is a 5 exonuclease which digests double stranded DNA. This reaction degraded the 5 half of the sense strand DNA from HBsAg coding sequences and exposed the antisense strand for pairing with added primer. The λ exonuclease treated DNA was deproteinized and resuspended in 50 µl of reaction mixture containing 40 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 , 1 mM DTT, 50 µg ml BSA, 6mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM each of dNTPs, and 0.2 n mole of dATGGAGAACATC ³²p label led at 5 end by polynucleotide kinase . The mixture was first heated at 90 c for 1 minute, annealed at 0 C for 30 minutes and then incubated at 37 C for 3 hours in the presence of 2 units of To create a unique restriction site site immediately 5 to the HBsAg gene we took advantage of a derivative of the plasmid pBR322 called pNCV which contains a synthetic DNA segment with the sequence AATTCTGCAG 2. The HBsAg gene from the plasmid pHBV T 1A was cleaved with HpaI at a site distal to the HBsAg gene. The HpaI site was ligated to a EcoRI site of pBR322 previously filled in with DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment 9 . This was accomplished by subcloning the derivative of pBR322 to give pHS42. This plasmid was cleaved with XbaI which cleaves at codon 31 and with Bam HI which cleaves 375 base pairs from the EcoRI site of pBR322 to give a DNA fragment containing most of the HBsAg gene, ca. 150 base pairs distal to the HBsAg gene, and the promotor operator and the first 200 base pairs of the tetracycline resistance gene. The DNA fragment C, bounded by To assure that we have large quantities of properly ligated DNA to transfect monkey cells, the ligated DNA was cloned in The properly constructed DNA, pSVHBSA, can then be cleaved with restriction endonuclease For the construction of pSVHBSA DNA, 0.3 µg of the SV40 DNA containing DNA fragment from the To test the efficiency of hepatitis surface antigen synthesis in such a vector system, the To determine whether the recombinant SV40 genome is packaged and propagated in CV 1 cells as is SV40 virus, a place of CV 1 cells was infected at 41 C with ts SV40 virus plus an aliquot of the lysate from the original co infected cells. Low molecular weight DNA from the infected cells was isolated by the method of Hirt 14 72 hours post infection. The isolated DNA was either untreated or cleaved with restriction endonucleases and fractionated by gel electrophoresis on agarose. The fractionated DNA was then denatured and transferred to nitrocellulose paper by the method of Southern 15 , and probed with ³²P labelled pHS94 DNA. As can be seen in Figure 7, the recombinant DNA molecules containing hepatitis gene sequence exist mostly as close circular DNA with a size indistinguishable from SV40 viral DNA lane A . The majority of the recombinant DNA regenerates its A 150 mm plate of CV 1 cells grown to 90 percent confluency was infected with a lysate prepared from an original transfection experiment which contained both recombinant and tsA28 viruses and incubated at 41 C after supplementation with excess tsA28 virus. After 70 hours post infection, medium was harvested to characterize the HBsAg synthesized. Additionally, intracellular low molecular weight DNA was isolated according to the methods of Hirt 14 . The isolated DNA was resuspended in 1 ml of buffer containing Tris Cl pH 7.4 , 1mM EDTA. Five µl of uncut DNA, and 5 µl of Hepatitis surface antigen is synthesized and secreted from infected liver cells as a particle 6 . Sequence analysis of various cloned hepatitis DNA suggests the possibility that the mature surface antigen may be cleaved from a larger precursor protein 8 . Since only DNA encoding the mature HBsAg molecule, plus some 3 untranslated sequences, are incorporated into the SV40 genome in the construction described, it can be asked whether the speculated precursor peptide plays any functional role in assembling the 22 nm particle and in its eventual secretion from the cell. To this end, the synthesized hepatitis surface antigen has been characterized by comparing its property with authentic protein through sedimentation velocity, sedimentation equilibrium, and electron microscopic analysis. As shown in Figure 8, the hepatitis surface antigen synthesized in this vector system has a sedimentation rate indistinguishable from hepatitis surface antigen isolated from the medium of an infected liver cell line 17 and has a buoyant density of 1.22 g cm³, again similar to an authentic surface antigen 22 nm particle 6 . Examination by electron microscopy of purified surface antigen has also revealed a predominant particulate structure with a mean diameter of 220 Å 22 nm , morphologically identical to authentic 22 nm particles Figures 8 and 9 . Therefore, the mature hepatitis surface antigen protein monomer is the only essential structural component encoded by hepatitis virus which is required for the assembly of the 22 nm particle. A. Comparison of the sedimentation velocity of HBsAg synthesized in CV 1 cells and that of HBsAG synthesized and secreted by a Hepatoma cell line PLC 17 and 18 . Figure 8A . Culture medium harvested from the experiment described in Figure 7 was the source of HBsAg used in this experiment. HBsAg produced by the PLC cell line 17 and 18 was harvested from the culture medium. HBsAg from both cultures was first precipitated by ammonium sulfate at 45 percent saturation and resuspended at a final concentration of HBsAg of 0.5 µg ml in a buffer containing 20 mM tris Cl pH 7.4 , 0.5 mM EDTA and 0.5 mM NaCl . 200 µl of each sample was loaded on two parallel 5 ml sucrose gradients 5 20 percent sucrose in the same buffer. Centrifugation was carried out at 45,000 rpm in a Beckman SW 50.1 rotor for 80 minutes at 4 C. HBsAg was detected using the commercial HBsAg assay kit Ausria 11 125, Abbott Lab . Recovery of HBsAg was invariably greater than 80 percent. B. Buoyant density determination of HBsAg synthesized in CV 1 cells. Figure 8B . 2 µg of HBsAg from pooled infected culture medium were precipitated by ammonium sulfate at 45 percent saturation, fractionated over an agarose gel permeation column A 5.0 M, Bio Rad , and then sedimented through a 5 20 percent sucrose gradient as described in A. After sucrose gradient centrifugation, pooled HBsAg was dialyzed against gradient buffer without sucrose, and solid CsCl was then added to give the solution 7 ml a final density of 1.2 g c.c. It was then centrifuged at 50,000 rpm in a Sorvall T 865.1 rotor for 68 hours. Assays were performed as described in A. Recovery of HBsAg in CsCl gradients was about 70 percent. Peak fractions were then pooled, dialyzed against 10 mM TrisCl, 100mM NaCl and 0.5 mM EDTA buffer, concentrated, and prepared for electron microscopic examination. To prepare the antigen for electron micrographs, carbon coated copper grids were prepared. One drop of buffer containing HBsAg protein 1 µg ml was placed on a grid for 30 min. at room temperature. The protein solution was blotted off the grid radially and washed once with 4 drops of H₂O. The grid was then stained with 1.0 percent Na phosphotungstate, pH 7.6, for one minute, and dried with filter paper. Electron micrographs were taken on a Phillips E. M. 400 at magnification 77700. This provided a negative from which a positive picture was made by enlargment ca. 10 times as depicted in Figure 9. Recombinant plasmids were assembled which contain pBR322 sequences derived from the plasmid pML 21 , 348 base pairs of SV40 DNA which comprise the origin region of DNA replication as well as the promoter sequences for both the early and late transcriptional units, and HBV sequences which encode the gene for HBsAg. The origin of SV40 was isolated by digesting SV40 DNA with HindIII, and converting the HindIII ends to EcoRI ends by the addition of a converter AGCTGAATTC . This DNA was cut with PvuII , and RI linkers added. Following digestion with EcoRI, the 348 base pair fragment spanning the origin was isolated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroelution, and cloned in pBR322. Expression plasmids pHBs348 E and pHBs348 L were constructed by cloning the 1986 base pair fragment resulting from EcoRI and BglII digestion of HBV 22 which spans the gene encoding HBsAg into the plasmid pML 21 at the EcoRI and BamHI sites. pML is a derivative of pBR322 which has a deletion eliminating sequences which are inhibitory to plasmid replication in monkey cells 21 The resulting plasmid pRI Bgl was then linearized with EcoRI, and the 348 base pair fragment representing the SV40 origin region was introduced into the EcoRI site of pRI Bgl . The origin fragment can insert in either orientation. Since this fragment encodes both the early and late SV40 promoters in addition to the origin of replication, HBV genes could be expressed under the control of either promoter depending on this orientation pHBS348 E representing HBs expressed under control of the early promoter pHBs348 L representing HBs expressed under control of the late promoter . The replication of HBV SV40 recombinant plasmids in the COS 7 line of monkey cells was demonstrated as follows At various times following DNA transfection by the DEAE dextran technique, low molecular weight DNA was isolated by the method of Hirt 14 , fractionated by electrophoresis in agarose gels and analyzed by Southern blot hybridization 15 . Figure 4 demonstrates that immediately following transfection, little or no supercoiled plasmid is present in COS cells. Three days after transfection, however, extensive replication of the input DNA has occurred, following introduction of either pHBs348 L DNA lane b or pHBs348 E DNA. As expected, no plasmid replication is observed following transfection of plasmid pRI Bgl which lacks the SV40 origin sequences but is otherwise identical to the above expression plasmids lanes a . Plasmids pML, pRI Bgl , pHBs348 E and pHBs348 L were introduced into the COS 7 line of monkey cells 23 , modifying the DEAE dextran procedure II by increasing the time of treatment and exposure of the cells to DEAE dextran and DNA to 12 hours. The COS 7 cells line harbors an integrated copy of the early region of SV40 and expresses constitutively the SV40 A gene product T antigen . Plasmids containing a functional origin of SV40 DNA replication have been demonstrated to replicate in monkey cells in the presence of SV40 T antigen 20, 21 . Figure 5 demonstrates that COS cells transfected with plasmids pHBs348 E and pHBS348 L begin expressing significant quantities of HBsAg by day 2, and continue expressing beyond a two week period. The level of expression directed by pHBs348 L is somewhat higher than that directed by pHBs348 E. One interpretation of these results is that the late SV40 promoter may be more effective than the early promoter in this system. Having demonstrated that tissue culture derived particles of HBsAg are antigenically active, it was desired to determine whether these particles are immunogenic in animals. Therefore, the antigen produced by COS 7 cells was purified by a combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation, sucrose gradient centrifugation, and CsCl density gradient centrifugation. Tissue culture derived HBsAg was injected into test mice, while control mice were immunized with identical quantities of commercially available HBsAg North American Biologicals Inc. derived from human serum. Titers of anti HBsAg were then determined at various times following immunization. Figure 6 illustrates that significant titers of anti HBsAg appeared in mice immunized with authentic HBsAg as well as in mice immunized with tissue culture derived HBsAg. In addition, the kinetics and titers of anti HBsAg antibody appearance in mice immunized with tissue culture derived HBsAg were indistinguishable from those observed in mice immunized with authentic HBsAg. We therefore conclude that HBsAg synthesized in monkey cells by recombinant DNA techniques is similar, if not identical, in immunogenicity to HBsAg derived from human serum, whose effectiveness as a vaccine has been amply demonstrated.
