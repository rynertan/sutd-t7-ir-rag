# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR HARVESTING MUSHROOMS AND THE LIKE

## Abstract
The invention is concerned with apparatus for harvesting mushrooms and the like. The apparatus comprises cutting means such as a knife which may be moved over a mushroom bed to sever mushrooms in the bed and lifting means 2 for removing the severed mushrooms from the bed and transfer ring them to collecting means 3 . The lifting means 2 com prises an air mover. The air mover is comprised of a cylindrical chamber or bore having an inlet disposed above the cutting means 1 and an outlet communicating with the collecting means 3 . Compressed air is directed into the chamber through an annular orifice which is so profiled to cause the air stream to flow towards the outlet. A zone of low pressure is created adjacent the chamber inlet which draws ambient air in to the chamber. The cut mushrooms are lifted into the cham ber, are entrained in the stream of air passing through the chamber, and are delivered onto the collecting means 3 which preferably is a conveyor 6 . In a preferred embodiment, the knife 1 and lifting means 2 are mounted on the end of an elongate conveyor frame 4 which is movable horizontally and vertically about a support column 20 so as to impart maxi mum manouverability to the cutting knife 1 and lifting means 2 .
