# SOLIDS MIXING APPARATUS

## Abstract
A machine for mixing solids in portable containers has a standard in which a mixing bar extending through the contain er may be rotably supported. A drive shaft extends from a drive station. The drive shaft rotates about a horizontal axis. The standard has an axis which intersects the logitudinal axis of the container at an angle other than 90 degrees, preferably 60 de grees, such that the longitudlnal axis of the container is tilted at an angle, preferably 30 degrees, to the vertical when the container and standard are clamped to the drive shaft with the axis of the standard horizontal and co indicent with the drive shaft axis. A clamp mecnanism in cooperative with the contain er, standard and drive shaft clamps the container so that its longitudinal axis is tilted to the vertical while it rotates about the horizontal axis of the drive shaft. The continuous tilt while revolving causes the container to execute a symmetric wobble motion for rapid and complete mixing blending of particulate material, whether fine or coarse, in the container.
