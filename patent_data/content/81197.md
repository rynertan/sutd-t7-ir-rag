# Hollow blow molded articles and molding method therefor.

## Abstract
A blow molding method comprising introducing a hot parison of a thermoplastic crystalline olefin resin into a mold cavity and blow molding it, characterized in that the blow molding is carried out under such temperature conditions that the surface temperature, T C, of the mold cavity satisfies the following expression 1 , T T wherein Î» is the heat conductivity of the heat insulating layer in cal cm sec C, and t is the thickness in cm of the heat insulating layer, and a hollow blow molded article of a thermoplastic crystalline olefin resin produced by the aforesaid method.
