# Ceramic capacitor having co fired base metal end terminations, and paste or ink for producing said end terminations.

## Abstract
A ceramic body containing embedded metal electrodes is provided with end termination configurations using a paste or ink containing base metal nickel or copper parti cles, glass frit barium borosilicate or barium aluminosilicate glass and MnOâ‚‚ in an organic vehicle, such as ethyl cellulose in butyl cellosolve. The body and end terminations are co fired to provide a ceramic capacitor.
