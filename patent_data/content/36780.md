# Method of producing photoelectric transducers.

## Abstract
In a method of producing a photoelectric transducer wherein a photoconductive layer is formed on a substrate 200 having an irregular surface, by deposition of the photoconductive layer in the atmosphere including at least plasma, the substrate is disposed above a first electrode 201 to which a second electrode 209 is opposed, and a negative potential is applied to the first electrode. This enables the photoconductive layer to be formed without breaks pinholes etc. due to the irregular surface of the substrate. It is thus possible to provide photoelectric trans ducers with a small dark current.
