# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CONVERTING OIL FEEDS

## Abstract
Novel riser reactor design with associated multiple feed inlet means for contacting regenerated catalyst par ticles with low quality naphtha, C₅ minus wet gas product of hydrocarbon conversion and a residual oil feed comprising components boiling above about 1025 F and comprising metal contaminants. Low quality naphtha from thermal cracking is charged either separately or in admixture with C₅ and lower boiling wet gas product of hydrocarbon con version to the bottom portion of the riser conversion zone for contact with freshly regenerated zeolite cracking cat alyst. The vaporous material thus charged conveys the re generated catalyst at an acceptable velocity to an expanded section of the riser wherein residual oil is charged by a plurality of nozzle means penetrating the wall of the riser in the transition section to the expander user section. A suspension of hydrocarbon vapors and catalyst particles is then passed through the riser discharge for a desired con tact time before separation by balistic separation with a cup about the riser upper to the riser end.
