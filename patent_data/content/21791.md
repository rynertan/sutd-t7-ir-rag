# A method of roll forming stock and forming leveller.

## Abstract
A forming leveller establishes one or more datum or reference planes in variable thickness stock to facilitate subsequent roll forming. The reference planes may be established on the same side or opposite sides of the stock with a lateral gap to facilitate transition forming. The leveller includes top and bottom closely spaced roll sets 90, 95, 91, 97, 92, 98 forming multiple passes mounted on bottom and top frames 42, 55 , respectively, with floating rolls 97 being opposed to fixed rolls 91 . Backup rolls are provided for the floating rolls and pressure devices 181 urge the floating rolls 97 against the stock in turn against the fixed rolls 91,92 to form the desired reference planes thus enabling complex shapes to be roll formed from the variable thickness stock.
