## Description
Process and apparatus for electromagnetic forming of molten metals or alloys, coolant manifold for electromagnetic casting. BACKGROUND OF MHF This invention relates to an improve process and apparatus for control of corner shape 1 in contInuous or semi continuous electromagnetic casting of desired shapes, such as for example, sheet or rectangular ingots of metals and alloys.The basic electromagnetic casting process has been knows and used for many years for continuously or semicontinuously casting metals and alloys. One of the problems which has been presented by electromagnetic casting of sheet or rectangular ingots has been the existence of high radius of curvature corners thereon. Rounding off of corners In electromagnetie cast sheet ingets is a result of higher electromagnetIc pressure at a given distance from the Inductor near e inget corners, where two proximate faces of the inductor generate a larger field.This is in contrast to lower electromagnetic pressure at the same distance from the inductor on the broad face of the ingot remote from the corner where Only one inductor face acts. There is a need to for small radius of curvature corners on sheet ingots so that during rolling cross sectional changes at the edges of the ingot are minimized. Larger radius of curvature corners accentuate tensile stress at the ingot edges during rolling which causes edge crackIng and loss of material. Thus, by reducing the rails of curvature of the ingot at the corners there is a maximizing in the production of useful material. It has been found In accordance with the present Inyentitn that rounding off of corners in electromagnetie cestng can be made less severe or of smaller redius by contouring the coclant application rate or elevation or beth so that the rate and or elevation is a minimum at the corners of the ingot. PRIOR ART SThTEMENT Known electromagnetic casting apparatus comprises a three part mold consisting of a water cooled inductor, a nonmagnetic screen and a manifold for applying cooling water to the ingot being cast. Such an apparatus is exemplified inU.S. Patent No. 3,467,166 to Getselev et al. Contairment of the molten metal is achieved without direct contact between the molten metal and any component of the mold. SolidifIcatIon of the molten metal is achieved by direct application of water from the cooling manifold to the forming ingot shell. In some prior art approaches the inductor is formed as part of the cooling manifold so that the cooling manifold supplies both coolant to solidify the casting and to cool the inductor. See U.S. Patent 4,004,631 to Goodrich et al. Non magnetic screens of the prior art are typically utilized to. properly shape the magnetic field for containing the molten metal as exemplified in U.S. Patent No. 3,605,865 to Getselev. Another approach with respect to use of nonmagnetic screens is exemplified as well in U.S. Patent No.3,985,179 to Goodrich et al. Goodrich et al. 179 describes the use of a shaped inductor in conjunction with a screen to modify the electromagnetic forming field. It is generally known that during electromagnetic casting the solidification front between the molten metal and the solidifying ingot at the ingot surface should be maintained within the zone of high magnetic field strength, i,e. the solidification front should be located within the inductor. f the soldiinication front extends above the inductor, cold folding is likely to occur. On the other hand, if it reaches to below the inductor, a bleed out or decantation of the liquid metal is likely to result. Getselev et al. 166 associate the coolant application manifold with the screen portion of the mold such that they are arranged for s inul taneous movement relative to the inductor. In U.S. PatentNo. 4,156,451 to Getselev a cooling medium is supplied upon the lateral face of the ingot in several cooling tiers arranged at various levels longitudinally of the ingot. Thus, depending on the pulling velocity of the ingot, the solidification front can be maintained within the inductor by appropriate selection of one of the tiers. Another approach to improved ingot shape consisted of provision of more unifor fields at conductor bus connections Canadian Patent No. 930,925 to Getselev . In electromagnetically casting rectzngular or sheet ingots, the ingots are often cast with hiCh radius of curvature ends or corners which is indicative of the need for improved ingot shape control at the corners of such ingots. Finally, United States Patent 3,502,133 to Carson teaches utilizing a sensor in a continuous or semi continuous casting mold to sense temperature variations at a particular location in the mold during casting. The sensor controls application of coolant to the mold and forming ingot. Use of such a device overcomes instabilities with respect to how much extra coolant is required at start up of the casting operation and just when or at what rate this excess cooling should be reduced. The ultimate purpose of adjusting the flow of coolant is to maintain the freeze line of the casting at a substantially constant location. Carson 133 teaches that ingots having a width to thickness ratio on the order of 3 to 1 or more possess an uneven cooling rate during casting when coolant is applied peripherally of the mold in a uniform manner. To overcome this problem, Carson 133 applies coolant to the wide faces of the ingot and or the mold walls and not at all Cor at least at a reduced rate to the relatively narrow end faces of the ingot ar,d or the mold walls All patents and applications described herein are intended to be incorporated by reference here4 . SUMMAR OF THE INVENTION The present invention comprises a process and apparatus for electromagnetic casting of metals and alloys into rectangular or sheet Ingots and other desired elements of shape control having small radius of curvature corners or portions by application of controlled static head Through metal head or pressure modification . In particular, a method and apparatus utilizing controlled diffeential static head by control of cooling water application to obtain refInement of ingot shape, particularly at the corners of rectangular ingots or other desired elements of shape in classed. According to the present invention control of ingot shape may be effected by selection of the rate or locatIon of cooling water application to the forming ingot shell within or below the containment inductor. Rounding off of corkers In electromagnetic casting can he made less severe or of smaller radius by contouring the water application rate or elevatIon Co both so that the rate or elevation is a minimum at the corners of the ingot. Reduction of the water application rate or lowering the application level serves to reduce the local heat extraction rate along an ingot transverse cross secticn line of constant height.This in turn lowers the position of the solidification front at the ingot corner and correspondingly raises the metal static head or pressure at the corner. This Increased pressure results in the liquid metal approaching the inductor more closely at the corner and thus filling the corner to form a smaller radius of curvature at the corner before theIncreased static pressure is counterbalanced by an increased electromagnetic force In accordance with one embodIment of this invent Ion a water manifold or coolIng water application device is provded with trilled holes or slots of a sise and or local hole density which s modified to yield locally reduced rates of water application at the ingot or desired shape corners. In accordance with another preferred embodiment of this invention a water manifold or cooling water application device is provided wherein the elevation of the supply holes is modified so as to apply water at the lowest elevation at the ingot or desired shape corners. In accordance with yet another preferred embodiment of his invent Ion the holes or slots in a water manifold or cooling water application device are modified such that the angle of the holes or slots around the corners of the Ingot cause the water to impnge on the ingot surface at a lower elevation at the Ingot corners. rt is of course understood that hybrds of local hole cross section, hole angle, and hole elevation can also be utilIzed In accordance with the concepts of this invention. In accordance with another preferred embodiment of this invention a water manifold or cooling water application device is provided which produces a water application rate of zero over short distances at the corners of the ingot or desired shape to further accentuate the effects of reduced local cooling. Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide an improved process and apparatus for electromagnetic casting of metals and alloys into sheet ingots, or other desired elements of shape control, characterized by small radius of curvature corners or port Ions thereon. This and other objects will become more apparent from the following description and drawings.

DETATIED DESCRIFTUION OF PREFERRED EMBODMEMTS In all drawing Figures alike parts are designated by alike numerals. Referring now to FIGURE 1 there is shown therein a prior art electromagnetic casting apparatus in accordance with U.S. Patent 4,158,379. The electromagnetic castIng mold 10 is comprised of an inductor 11 which is water cooled a coolant manifold 12 for applying cooling water to the peripheral surface 13 of the metal being cast C and a non magnetic screen lii. Molten metal is continuously introduced into the mold 10 during a casting run, in the normal manner usIng a trough 15 and down spout 15 and ccnventional molten metal head control. The inductor 11 is excited by an alternating current from a suitable power source not shown . The alternatIng current In the inductor 11 produces a magnetic field which interacts it the molten metal head 19 to produce eddy currents therein These eddy currents In turn interact with the magnetic field and produce forces which apply a magnetic pressure to the molten metal head 19 to cntain it so that It solidifies in a desired ingot cross section. an air gap exists during casting, between the molten metal head 19 and the inductor 11. The molten metal head 19 is formed or molded into the same general shape as the inductor 11 thereby provIdIng the desired Ingot cross section. The induct or may have any desired shape including circular or rectangular as required to obtain the desired ingot C cross section. The purpose of the non magnetic screen 14 is to fir.e tune and balance the magnetic pressure with the hydrostatic pressure of the molten metal head 19. The non magretic screen 14 comprises a separate element as shown, and is not a part of the manifold 12 for applying the coolant. Initially, a conventional ram 21 and bottom block 22Is held in the magnetic containment zone of the mold 10 to allow the molten metal to be poured Into the mold at the start of the casting run. The ram 21 and bottom block 22 are the uniforml withdrawn at a desired casting rate. SolIdIficatIon of the molten metal which is magnetioally contained in the mcli 10 is achieved by direct application of water from the cooling manifold 12 to the ingot surface 13. The water is shown applied to the ingot surface 13 within the confines of the inductor 11. The water may be applied, however,to the ingot surface 13 from above, within or below the inÅauctor 11 as desired. The solIdIfIcatIon front 25 of the casting comprises the boundary between the molten metal head 19 and the solidified ingot C. The location of the solidification front 25 at the ingot surface 13 results from a balance of the heat input from the superheated liquid metal 19 and the resstance heating from the Induced currents in the Ingot surface layer, with the longitudinal heat extracticn from the cooling water applIcatIon. Coolant manifold 12 is arranged above the inductc. 1 and Includes at least one dIscharge port 28 at the end of extended portion 30 for directing the coolant against the surface 13 of the ingot or casting. The discharge port 28 can comprise a slot or a pluralIty of individual orifices for directing the coolant against the surface 13 of the ingot C about the entire periphery of that surface. Coolant manifold 12 is arranged for movement along vertically extending rails 38 and 39 axIally of the ingor C such that extended portion 30 and discharge port 28 can be moved between the non magnetic screen 14 and the Induct or 11.Axial adjustment of the discharge port 28 posItion is provided by means of cranks 4o mounted to screws 41. The coolant is discharged against the surface of the casting in the direction Indicated by arrows 43 to define the place of coolant application. Figure a is a schenatie cress sectional representation of one embodiment of a system for atpllcatlon of z coolant in accordance with this Invent Ion. Lie 29 divides Figure 2 into two sides CA and B . Side CAZ shows a section through a face of rectangular Ingot 20 and inductor 11 while side tS shows a section through the corner of the same elements. Coolant, typically water, is eupplied to the peripheral surface 13 of Ingot 20 via holes 17 in induoter 11 . Rounding off of corners in elactremagnetic dasting results from higher electromagnetic pressure at a given distance from the Induct or near the corner Cohere two prorimate facs of the single turn inducter generate field and from excess cooling or higher heat extractIon rates at the corners because of geomatrc and fgher heat transfer characteristIcs Referring to Igre 2, dctted lire 23 exemplifies the location of the solidfication front at the corner of an ingot Cside B which is cooled by known uniform rate and height peripheral coolant flow directed to the surface 13 of rectangular ingot 20.As can be seen, excess cooling at the corners of the ingot 20 cause the solidification front to rise in comparison to the elevation of the solidification front along the faces of the ingot 20 Cside A , denoted by dashed line 24. Thus, b, the height of the solidification front from the point of coolant impingement at the corners of the ingot 20 Is greater than a, the height of the solidification front from the point of coolant impingement along the faces of the ingot 20.This combination of hIgher solidIfication front lower head and Increased magnetic pressure at the corners causes the pushing of molten metal away from the corners thereby producing a highly undesirable rounding off of the ingot corners. In accordance wih this invention coolant application devices are mdified to produce controlled differential static head leadIng to refInement of ingot shapes at the corners, and in particular to form smaller radius of curvatures a ingot corners. Control of ingot shape is effected in accordance with the present invention by selection of the rate and or locatIon of cooling water impingement upon the surface of forming Ingot shells. Rounding off of corners in electro magnetIc casting can be made less severe or of smaller radius by contourIng the water application rate and or elevation so that the rate and or elevation is a ir.i ..UN at the corner of the ingot. Reduction of the water ap licatiRn rate and or lowering of the application level serves to reduce the local heat extractIon rate along an ingot transverse cross section line of constant height.This in turn lowers the position of the solidification front at the ingot corners and correspondingly raises the metal static head or pressure at the corners. This Increased pressure results in the liquid metal approaching the inductor more closely at the corners and thereby filling the corner to form a smaller radius of curvature before the Increased static pressure is counterbalanced by the increased electromagnetic force. As can be seen from Figure 2, the elevation of the water impinement at the side B Cthe corner of Ingot 20 in accordance with this inventIon is lower than the elevation at side G along the face of the ingot 20 by virtue of the modIficatIon in elevation and angle of holes 17 in inlcte 11 . The slidification front 25 forms as a result at a height b above the point of water impingement point 2 but at a level lower than the point 27 where the solidification front 25 forms along the faces of ingot 20. As an alternative to altering the angle and or elevation of holes 17 in inductor 11 it would be possIble to obtain a lowering of the soldification front at the corners of Ingot 20 by reducirg the diameter of holes 17 and or by blockIng one er more holes locally of the corners thereby partIally reducing or reducing to zero the rate of water application at the ingot corners. Of course hybrids of hole size, density, elevation, angle and blockage could be devised to obtain the results desired wIth respect to cooling rate at the corners in accordance with this invention. Figure 3 shows a partial schematic cross sectional represent at Ion of the electromagnetIc casting apparatus ofFigure 1 with a modified coolant manifold 12 In accordance with another embodiment of this invention. FIgure 3 shows extended portion 30 to have a discharge port 28 CSide CB having a modifIed slot discharge angle causing impingement of coolant water at a lower elevation at the corners of Ingot 20. Side CA shows a standard or unmodified discharge port 28 which impinges water at a higher level along the faces of ingot 20. Solidification front 25 is seen to be at a higher level as designated by point 27 along the faces of the ingot than at or near the corners of ingot 20, designated by point 26. Figure 4 shows a partial schematic cross sectional represent at Ion of the electromagnetic casting apparatus ofFigures 1 and 3 with a modified coolant manifold 12 in accordance with yet another embodiment of this Invention. In Figure a, extended portion 30 of modified coolant manifold 12 is constructed with discharge port 28 completely blocked off at or near the corners of ingot 20 CSide B by portion 31 of coolant manifold 12 . Thus there Is zero local cooling in the immediate corners of Ingot 20 causIng solidIfication front 25 to drop to the point 26 at the corners of ingot 20. Side A shows that the solidificatIon front 25 stays at point 27 along the faces of the ingot. there slot type coolant manIfolds such as depIcted In Figures 1, 3 and Li are used, the slot cross sect Ion can be accurately contoured to produce a smoothly varying water flow rate with a minimum or zero flow rate at or near the ingot corner posItIons. In addition to altering the angle of slot discharge, it is contemplated to alter the extended portion 30 at the areas of the corners of the ingot 20 to modfy the elevation of the slot discharge ports so as to be lowest at the Ingot corners. Thus the elevation of the impinging water can be alterred by altering the angle and or the actual elevation of the discharge slots. Again, hybrids of contoured slot cross section, elevation and angle could be devised to carry cut the process of this invention. ire 5 is a bottom plan view locking up into an extended portion 30 of a manifold and shows corners possessing different slot modificatios in accordance with this invention. Extended portion 30 comprises an Inner wall 32, an cuter wall 34 and a iscar port 28. Corner C shows an unmedified rll slot discharge port 28 with a slot width equal to that along the four faces of extended portion 30. Corner D shows a contoured slot discharge port 28 it zero slot wdth elosed at the exact corner 62 of extended potion 30.Corner E shows a contoured slot discharge port 28 with zere slot width over about half the corner radius 64 of extended port Ion 30 and corner F shows zero slot width over about vrtually the whole corner radius 66 of extended portion 32. The aforedescrihed variants in coolant applying equip mert are typically designed so as to modify the coolant application rate and or impact point within about three nches on either side of a corner while the maximum extent of the modifications in coolant application is to result in suh absence of coolant application over about one inch or less of the ingot surface about the corner. The novel method and apparatus of the present invention find applicability in the electromagnetic casting of any shapes, wherein it is desired to form portions thereon of low radius of curvature. It is apparent that there has been provided with this invention a novel process and means for utilizing controlled differential static head by control of coolant applcation to obtain refinement of ingot shape during electromagnetIc casting which fully satisfy the objects, means and advantages set forth herein before. While the invention has been described in combination with specific embodiments thereof, it is evident that many alternatives, modifications and varIatIons will be apparent to those skilled in the art In light of the foregoing descrIptIon. Accordingly, it is intended to embrace all such alternatives, modifications and varIations as fall within the spirit and broad scope of the appended claims.
