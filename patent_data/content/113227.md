# Engine performance monitor and control system.

## Abstract
An engine performance monitor for determining the relative combusion efficiencies of the cylinders of a multiple cylinder internal combustion engine permits monitoring of engine performance to test engine fuel distribution system and ignition system control strategies. The system can also be incorporated into a feedback system for controlling the performances of the various individual cylinders of a multi ple cylinder internal combustion engine.
