# Telescopic shock absorber.

## Abstract
A telescopic type shock absorber 10 includes an outer tube 40, 50, 60, 70 which is larger in outside diameter at the upper section than at the lower section but smaller in wall thickness at the upper section than at the lower section. Such distributions of outside diameter and wall thickness decrease the rigidity of the outer tube 40, 50, 60, 70 from the lower end to the upper end thereof. The rigidity in the lower section is sufficient to withstand the maximum bending stresses which occur at the lower end where the tube 40, 50, 60, 70 is fixed to a knuckle spindle 14 . The reduced rigidity in the upper section allows the outer tube 40, 50, 60, 70 to bend along with a piston rod 26 and reduces the frictional resistance between the piston rod 26 and a bearing 16 . The outer tube 40, 50, 60, 70 defines a larger annular space for a fixed length thereof in cooperation with an inner tube 20 to reduce the compression ratio of air which is confined in the annular space.

## Description
Background of the Invention The present invention generally relates to aMacPherson type suspension system for a vehicle and, more particularly, to a telescopic type shock absorber for such a suspension system. The telescopic shock absorber comprises an inner tube, a piston carried at the lower end of a piston rod and which is sealingly slidable in the inner tube and an outer tube which coaxially surrounds the inner tube and piston rod. The piston rod slides through a bearing fixed to the upper ends of the inner and outer tubes and is fixed at its upper end to a vehicle suspension. The lower end of the outer tube is fixed to a knuckle spindle for a wheel. The vehicle is supported by means of the wheel, knuckle spindle, shock absorber and suspension.The inner and outer tubes are filled with hydraulic fluid to dampen relative telescopic movement between the piston and the inner and outer tubes and thereby dampen road shocks resulting from the operation of the vehicle. The outer tube of such a shock absorber is subjected to a substantial magnitude of bending moment in proportion to a weight of the vehicle. This bending moment is received by the relatively sliding surfaces of the inner tube and piston and those of the bearing and piston rod.Therefore, the maximum bending stress occurs at the lower end of the outer tube remotest from the bearing and where it is fixed to the knuckle spindle. Prior art telescopic shock absorbers comprise outer tubes which have uniform inner and outer diameters and wall thicknesses. The wall thickness and inner and outer diameters are selected to be sufficient to absorb the maximum bending stress in the lower portion of the outer tube. This results in an overdesign and an increased weight of the upper portion of the outer tube which inherently does not bear any substantial bending moment and, thus, generates only a minimum of stress. Excess rigidity of the outer tube prevents the bearing and inner tube from bending along with the piston rod during operation of the vehicle. This increases the frictional resistance between the piston rod and the bearing at the upper end of the tubes, preventing smooth operation of the shock absorber.Summary of the Invention A telescopic type shock absorber embodying the present invention includes an inner tube, a piston carried at a lower end of a piston rod and sealingly slidable in the inner tube, an outer tube coaxially surrounding the inner tube and piston rod and carrying a knuckle spindle at a lower end thereof, and a bearing fixed to upper ends of the inner and outer tubes. The outer tube has a wall thickness which is smaller at an upper section than at a lower section and an outside diameter which is larger at the upper section than at the lower section. In accordance with the present invention, a telescopic type shock absorber includes an outer tube which is larger in outside diameter at the upper section than at the lower section but smaller in wall thickness at the upper section than at the lower section. Such distributions of outside diameter and wall thickness decrease the rigidity of the outer tube from a lower end to an upper end thereof. The rigidity in the lower section is sufficient to withstand the maximum bending stress which occurs at the lower end where the tube is fixed to a knuckle spindle. The reduced rigidity in the upper section allows the outer tube to bend along with a piston rod and reduces the frictional resistance between the piston rod and a bearing.The outer tube defines a larger annular space for a fixed length thereof in cooperation with an inner tube to reduce the compression ratio of air which is confined in the annular space. It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved telescopic shock absorber having an outer tube which features reduced internal friction and wear and a reduced weight. It is another object of the present invention to provide an improved telescopic shock absorber which is excellent in its shock absorbing operation by defining a larger space for air between outer and inner tubes for a fixed available length of the outer tube. It is another object of the present invention to provide a generally improved telescopic shock absorber. Other objects, together with the foregoing, are attained in the embodiments described in the following description and illustrated in the accompanying drawing.Brief Description of the Drawing Figure 1 is a sectional view of a prior art tele scopic shock absorber and Figures 2 to 5 are fragmentary sections which are similar to each other but showing first to fourth embodiments of a telescopic shock absorber of the present invention, respectively.Description of the Preferred Embodiments While the telescopic shock absorber of the present invention is susceptible of numerous physical embodiments, depending upon the environment and requirements of use, substantial numbers of the herein shown and described embodiments have been made, tested and used, and all have performed in an eminently satisfactory manner. Referring now to Figure 1 of the drawing, a prior art telescopic type shock absorber is generally designated by the reference numeral 10 and comprises an outer tube 12. The lower end of the outer tube 12 is fixedly connected to a knuckle spindle 14 which, although not shown, rotatably supports a wheel of a vehicle. A bearing 16 and an oil seal 18 are provided at the upper end of the outer tube 12. An inner tube 20 is fixed in place inside the outer tube 12 in a coaxial manner and a piston 22 is slidable in the inner tube 20. An annular seal 24 is provided to the piston 22 for sealing engagement with the inner wall of the inner tube 20. The annular space between the tubes 12 and 20 and the interior of the tube 20 below the piston 22 communicate with each other through holes not shown and these spaces are filled with hydraulic fluid or oil except for an upper part of the space between the tubes 12 and 20 which is filled with air.The piston 22 is further provided with a valve not shown to dampen movement of the piston 22 and the tube 20. The shock absorber 10 further comprises a piston rod 26 which extends upwardly from the piston 22 through the bearing 16 and seal 18 and is connected to a suspension of the vehicle through a resilient rubber bushing not shown . Further illustrated are a spring seat 28 and a coil suspension spring 30 which is operatively mounted between the spring seat 28 and the suspension. A stop 32 is fixed to the piston rod 26 to prevent overextension of the shock absorber 10 through abutment with the lower end of the bearing 16. Upon contraction of the shock absorber 10, the piston rod 26 strokes downward relative to the inner tube 20 to cause a smooth inflow of a part of the hydraulic fluid from the contracting space in the inner tube 20 below the piston 22 into the expanding space above the piston 22. At the same time, the rest or surplus of the fluid is forced into the annular space between the tubes 12 and 20. Upon expansion of the shock absorber 10, the piston rod 26 strokes upward relative to the inner tube 20 so that the fluid in the space inside the tube 20 above the piston 22 is forced down into the space below the piston 22 under a resistance imparted thereto by the valve provided to the piston 22. A short volume of the fluid is supplemented from the annular space between the tubes 12 and 20. The prior art shock absorber 10 cannot avoid the previously discussed drawbacks due to the inherent structure of the outer tube 12 described hereinabove. Throughout the drawing Figures which will be described hereinbelow, parts and elements common to those of Figure 1 will be omitted with only unique outer tube configurations illustrated. Referring to Figure 2, the outer tube 40 comprises a lower portion 41, an upper portion 42 and a downwardly tapered connecting portion 43 which spans between the lower and upper portions 41 and 42. The lower portion 41 has an outside diameter D1 smaller than the outside diameter D2 of the upper portion 42 but a wall thickness tl larger than the wall thickness t2 of the upper portion 42. The tapered connecting portion 43 has a wall thickness which decreases progressively in an upward direction until it merges into the thickness t2 of the thinner portion 42. Thus, the rigidity of the outer tube 40 is the largest at the junction of the outer tube 40 and knuckle spindle 14 but is decreased progressively therefrom to the upper end of the tube 40. Such a rigidity distribution absorbs the bending stress throughout the length of the tube 40 which is the maximum at the junction of the tube 40 and knuckle spindle 14. This reduces the weight of the outer tube 40 while ensuring smooth movement of the piston rod 26 by allowing the sliding portions of the tube 40 to well follow bending of the piston rod 6. The decrease in the weight of the tube 40 offers a decrease in the unsprung weight of the vehicle which in turn improves the road holding ability of the vehicle and the dampening efficiency of the shock absorber.Additionally, a larger volume of annular space is available between the uniquely shaped outer tube 40 and inner tube 20 for a predetermined length of the tube 40. This suppresses the compression ratio of air inside the annular space upon a downward stroke of the piston rod 26 and thereby promotes efficient shock absorbing actions. Figure 3 illustrates another outer tube 50 embodying the present invention which comprises an intermediate portion 53 in addition to a lower portion 51 and an upper portion 52. The wall thickness of the tube 50 is the largest tl at the lower portion 51, medium t2 at the intermediate portion 53 and smallest t3 at the upper portion 52. Conversely, the outside diameter of the tube 50 is the smallest D1 at the lower portion 51, medium D2 at the intermediate portion 53 and largest D3 at the upper portion 52. The portions 51 and 53 are connected together by a downwardly tapered connecting portion 54 while the portions 52 and 53 are interconnected by a second downwardly tapered connecting portion 55. It will be apparent to those skilled in this art that four, five or even more such evenly thick portions may be interconnected by successive tapered portions if desired without any detriment to the effects previously discussed. Figure 4 illustrates another outer tube 60 embodying the present invention which comprises a lower portion 61 and an upper portion 62. This tube 60 has a wall thickness which decreases continuously from the junction of the lower and upper portions 61 and 62 to the end of the upper portion 62, and an outside diameter which increases also continuously from said junction to said end of the upper portion 62. Figure 5 illustrates still another outer tube 70 embodying the present invention which comprises a lower portion 71, an upper portion 72 and a downwardly tapered connecting portion 73. In this case, not only the connecting portion 73 but the upper portion 72 are tapered downwardly such that the outside diameter of the tube 70 increases continuously in an upward direction and the wall thickness decreases also continuously in the same direction. In summary, it will be seen that the present invention provides a telescopic shock absorber which is light weight and operable in a desirable manner. Various modifications will become possible for those skilled in the art after receiving the teachings of the present disclosure without departing from the scope thereof.
