# Stencil paper for mimeography and process for making stencil.

## Abstract
A stencil paper for mimeography is disclosed. The paper is comprised of a porous base which is permeable to mimeographic ink, having thereon a heat sensitive layer of a material that is solid at ordinary temperatures but which liquifies upon heating. A process for making a stencil is also disclosed, which comprises placing the stencil paper in contact with a receiving medium and selectively heating the stencil paper to liquify portions of the heat sensitive layer, and allowing the liquified portions of the heat sensitive layer to transfer to the receiving medium.
