# Shaft seal.

## Abstract
The claimed axial seal 2 comprises a cylindrical mounting part 2 by means of which it is fixed on the shaft 1 and an axial sealing lip 2 . In the mounting position the lips 2 presses against a counterface 4 due to which sealing of the lubricant is achieved. According to the invention the shape of the seal 2 is such that when it is pressed against the counterface 4 the line of contact becomes oval or elliptic through which during rotating of the shaft 1 an oscillating motion of the contact path in radial direction relative to the counterface 4 is ensured, also achieving a sweeping effect.
