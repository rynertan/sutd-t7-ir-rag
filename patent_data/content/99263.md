# Digital computer for executing multiple instruction sets in a simultaneous interleaved fashion.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a digital computer for executing a first instruction set in an interleaved fashion with second and third instruction sets, the latter two of which are executed at the same time. The first, second, and third instruction sets together represent an assignment statement of a high level programming language, such as ALGOL and COBOL, and by executing the first, second, and third instruction sets as recited above, a substantial improvement in the execution time of the corresponding assignment statement is attained.
