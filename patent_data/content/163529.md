# Insulin precursors, process for their preparation and process for preparing human insulin from such insulin precursors.

## Abstract
Human insulin precursors containing the peptide chain B 1 29 A 1 21 of human insulin and derivatives thereof with a bridging chain connecting the carboxyl terminus of the B 1 29 chain with the amino terminus of the A 1 21 chain are prepared by culturing a yeast host transformed with a replicable expression vehicle capable of expressing a DNA sequence encoding the insulin precursor. The bridging chain is preferably relatively short and contains preferably from 2 to 8 amino acid residues. The bridging chain must not contain two adjacent basic amino acid residues Lys or Arg and has one Lys or Arg connected to the amino terminus of the A 1 21 chain. Human insulin is prepared from the insulin precursors by in vitro conversion.
