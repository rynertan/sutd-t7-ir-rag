# Prompt line display arrangement in a word processing system.

## Abstract
Word processing system having a keyboard 10 , a display 20 , a processor 14 and a random access memory 22 for storing data and programs. The display 20 includes a first text area 24 wherein text entered through the keyboard is displayed. The display also includes a prompt line 26 through which all input between the operator and the word processing system occurs. The system provides deadkey compression wherein the depression of selected deadkeys on the keyboard causes the automatic generation of a required backspace in order to enable the construction of a diacritic character and the display of the contructed diacritic character in either the text display area 24 or the prompt line 26 .
