The term lower alkyl and lower alkoxy is used herein to denote such groups containing up to 6, and in particular 1 to 3, carbon atoms. Preferred compounds are those wherein R represents a hydrogen atan and each of R1, R2 and R7 represents a methyl grcup also those wherein each of R3, Rg and R6 represents a hydrogen atan and R4 represents a methyl group. The invention also provides a process for the preparation of compounds as defined above which comprises reacting a urea of formula III EMI2.1 with a diketo ccanpaund of formula X CO CO X, wherein both groupsX represent a halogen, preferably chlorine, atom, or one X represents a hydrogen atan and the other represents a hydrogen atom or a hydroxyl group.The starting urea of formula III may be prepared fran the precursor amune of formula IIEMI2.2 by conventional methods such as reaction with phosgene or an isocyanate of formula The preparation of the preferred individual species of these amines preferred because of the high phytotoxicity of the compounds of Formula I prepared therefrom , wherein R is hydrogen, and R1 and R2 each is methyl, is described in Example 1, hereinafter. Other individual species of these amines can be prepared by analogous methods. The article by M.A. Schexnayder and P.S. Engel, J. Am. Chew. Soc., 1975, 97, 4825 4836, discloses 2,2 dimethyl 3 butynoic acid, the precursor for the preferred amine and two methods for its preparation.Other needed precursors can be prepared by those methods. For convenience in the are detailed description of the alternative process variants, the compounds of the invention may be subdivided into four subclasses as follows A. The imidazolidinetriones R and R4 together are oxo, R5 and R6 together are oxo. B. The hydroxyimidazolidinones 1. R is hydrogen, R4 is hydroxy, R5 and R6 together are oxo 2. R5 is hydrogen, R6 is hydroxy, R and R4 together are C. The dihydroxyimidazolidinones each of R3 and R5 is hydrogen, each of R4 and R6 is hydroxy D. The hydroxyimidazolidinones each of R3, R5 and R6 is hydrogen, R4 is hydroxy. Compounds of Subclass A can be prepared by treating the appropriate urea of Formula III with oxalyl chloride in the presence of an inert solvent, at a moderately elevated temperature. The reaction proceeds according to the equation EMI3.1 Treatment of the urea with oxalyl chloride is conveniently conducted by adding the chloride to a stirred solution of the urea in an inert solvent such as toluene and reflexing the mixture for a sufficient time to enable the reaction to go to completion. The hydrogen chloride by product is removed as a gas as it is evolved. Workup of the reaction mixture, isolation of the product and its purification are effected by conventional techniques, as illustrated in Example 1, hereinafter. Compounds of Subclass B can be prepared by treating the appropriate urea III with glyoxylic acid conveniently as the hydrate in the presence of an inert solvent, at a moderately elevated temperature, The reaction proceeds according to the equation EMI4.1 Treatment of the urea with glyoxylic acid is conveniently conducted by adding the acid to a stirred solution of the urea in an inert solvent such as methylene chloride and refluxing the mixture for a sufficient tine to enable the reaction to go to oompletion. The water by product preferably is removed as a vapour as it evolves. Workup of the reaction mixture, isolation of the product and its purification are effected by conventional techniques, as illustrated in Example 5, hereinafter. Compounds of Subclass C can be prepared by treating the appropriate urea III with an aqueous solution of glyoxal at a moderately elevated temperature. The reaction proceeds according to the equation EMI4.2 Treatment of the urea with glyoxal is conveniently conducted by slowly adding the aquous solution of glyoxal to a reflexing solution of the urea in a solvent such as toluene, and removing water from the mixture azeotropically. Workup of the reaction mixture, isolation of the product and its purification are effected by coonentional procedures, as illustrated inExample 4, hereinafter. Ctapctnds of Subclass D are prepared from the appropriate amine II by a three step process in which a the amine is treated with phosgene to form the isocyanate dimer EMI5.1 the the diner is treated with a dimethyl acetal,EMI5.2 to form a carpound of the formulaEMI5.3 c which is heated in an acidic aqueous medium to form the compound of Subclass D, of the formulaEMI5.4 The diner can be prepared by treating the hydrochloride salt of the amine II with phosgene, use of the hydrochloride salt, rather than the amine per se, minimizing the formation of undesired symmetrical urea fran the amine.The hydrochloride salt is conveniently formed in situ by including hydrogen chloride in the reaction mixture a solution of slurry of the amine in a solvent such as ethyl acetate is added to a solution of phosgene tRo moles mole of amine in a solvent such as ethyl acetate also containing the hydrogen chloride. The resulting mixture is heated at a moderately elevated temperature for a time sufficient for the reaction to go to completion. Unreacted phosgene can be removed by purging the reaction mixture with nitrogen. The diner can be isolated by evaporating the solvent.Then a solution of the dimer and the appropriateN R7 aminoacetaldehydr dimethylacetal in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran is heated at a moderately elevated temperature to effect the reaction and stripped of solvent to give the crude product, which can be purified by recrystallization fran, for example, a mixture of ether and hexane. That product is converted to a compound of Formula I by heating it at a moderate temperature in a dilute solution of an inert acid, such as hydrochloric acid. The desired product can be isolated by extracting the aqueous mixture with a suitable water insoluble solvent, such as methylene chloride, and evaporating the solvent fran the extract. The preparation, isolation and testing of six typical individual species of the compounds of Formula I are described in the examples, following. The class of compounds is further illustrated and exemplified by the following further individual species, all of which are specifically contemplated in this invention. In the interest of brevity, in the identification of these species, they will be identified in terms of four subclasses Species No. R R1 R2 R7Subclass A 1 H methyl methyl cyclopropyl 2 methoxy 3 n H methyl 4 n ethyl 5 methyl methyl methyl n Species No.R RÚ Rê R7Subclass B 6 H methyl methyl cyclopropane 7 H n n 8 n H methyl 9 n ethyl 10 methyl methyl methyl Subclass C 11 H methyl methyl Cyclopropyl 12 methoxy 13 n n H methyl 14 n ethyl 15 methyl methyl methyl nSubclass D 1 H methyl methyl cycloprcpyl 2 II R n methyl 3 n ethyl 4 methyl methyl Compounds of Formula I have been found to affect adversely the growth of plants, many of which are commonly considered as weeds, and therefore to be useful for controlling the growth of such unwanted plants.Compounds of Subclass D, Formula I, have been found to have selectivity with respect to sate crop plants i.e., they control weeds at dosages at which they do not significantly harm the crop plants. Compounds of Formula I appear to be effective when applied preemergence or preplant incorporated applied to the soil before the seeds have sprouted or when applied postemergence applied to the foliage of the growing plant . They appear to be somewhat more effective when applied preemergence than when applied postemergence. Accordingly, the invention includes a method of combating unwanted plants which comprises applying to the locus an effective amount of a compound of Formula I. In the cases where it is desired to control weeds in crop plantings, it is of course preferable to employ the lowest dosage that will control the weeds, for this will minimize any possible deleterious effect of the compound upon the crop plants. Protection of a locus or area fran undesirable plants is effected by applying a compound of Formula I, ordinarily in a composition of one of the types described below, to soil in which the seeds of the unwanted plants are present, or to the foliage of the unwanted plants. The e active compound, of course, is applied in an amount sufficient to exert the desired action.The amount of the oampsano of the invention to be used in catating undesired plants will naturally depend on the condition of the plants, the degree of activity desired, the formulation used, the node of application, the climate, the season of the year, and other variables. Recommendations as to precise amounts are, therefore, not possible. Th general, however, application to the locus to be protected of fran 0.01 to 10.0kg per hectare of the compound of Formula I will be satisfactory. For application, the catpound generally is applied itost effectively by formulating it with a suitable inert carrier or surface active agent, or both. The invention, therefore, also includes oompositions suitable for combating unwanted plants, such compositions comprising an inert carrier or surface active agent, or both, in association with, as active ingredient at least one compound of Formula I, and a method of making such a composition which comprises bringing a compound of formula I into association with at least one carrier. The term carrier as used herein means an inert solid or fluid material, which may be inorganic or organic and of synthetic or natural origin, with which the active ccnpaund is mixed or formulated to facilitate its application to the plant, seed, soil or other object to be treated, or its storage, transport and or handling. Any of the materials customarily employed in formulating pesticides, herbicides, or fungicides, are suitable. A carrier in a composition according to the invention is any material with which the active ingredient is formulated to facilitate application to the locus to be treated, which may for example be a plant, seed or soil, or to facilitate storage, transport or handling.A carrier may be a solid or a liquid, including a material which is normally gaseous but which has been compressed to form a liquid, and any of the carriers normally used in formulating herbicidal compositions may be used. Preferably compositions acceding to the invention contain 0.5 to 95 by weight of active ingredient. Suitable solid carriers include natural and synthetic clays and silicates, for example natural silicas such as diatataceous earths magnesium silicates, for example talcs magnesium aluminium silicates, for example attapulgites and vermiculites aluminium silicates, for example kaolinites, montatorillonites and micas calcium carbonate calcium sulphate ammonium sulphate synthetic hydrated silicon oxides and synthetic calcium or aluminium silicates elements, for example carbon and sulphur natural and synthetic resins, for example coumarone resins, polyvinyl chloride, and styrene polymers and copolymers solid polychlorophenols bitumen waxes and solid fertilisers, for example superphosphates. Suitable liquid carriers include water alcohols, for example isoprep2nol and glycols ketones, for example a acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone and cyclohexanone ethers aromatic or araliphatic hydrocarbons, for example benzene, toluene and xylene petroleum fractions, for example kerosine and light mineral oils chlorinated hySrocaons, for example carbon tetrachloride, perchloooet rlene and trichloroethane. Mixtures of different liquids are often suitable. Agricultural compositions are often formulated and transported in a concentrated form which is subsequently diluted by the user before application. The presence of small amounts of a carrier which is a surface active agent facilitates this process of dilution. Thus preferably at least one carrier in a composition according to the invention is a surface active agent. For example the composition may contain at least two carriers, at least one of which is a surface active agent. A surface active agent may be an emulsifying agent, a dispersing agent or a wetting agent it may be nonionic or ionic. Examples of suitable surface active agents include the sodium or calcium salts of polyacrylic acids and lignin sulphonic acids the condensation of fatty acids or aliphatic amines or amides containing at least 12 carbon atoms in the molecule with ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide fatty acid esters of glycerol, sorbitan, sucrose or pentaerythritol condensates of these with ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide condensatisn products of fatty alcohol or alkyl phenols, for example p octylphenol or p octylcresol, with ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide sulphates or sulphonates of these condensation products alkali or alkaline earth nepal salts, preferably sodium salts, of sulphuric or sulphonic acid esters containing at least 10 carbon atans in the molecule, for example sodium lauryl sulphate, sodium secondary alkyl sulphates, sodium salts of sulphonated castor oil, and sodium alkylaryl sul phanates such as dodecylbenzene sulphonate and polymers of ethylene oxide and copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide. Ihe compositions of the invention may for example be formulated as wettable powders, dusts, granules, solutions, emulsifiable concentrates, emulsions, suspension conoentrates and aerosols. Wettable powders usually contain 25, 50 or 75 w of active ingredient and usually contain in addition to solid inert carrier, 3 10 w of a dispersing agent and, where necessary, 0 108 w of stabiliser s and or other additives such as penetrants or stickers.Dusts are usually formulated as a dust concentrate having a similar composition to that of a wettable powder but without a dispersant, and are diluted in the field with further solid carrier to give a ccmposition usually containing h 108 w of active ingredjent. Granules are usually prepared to have a size between 10 and 100 BS mesh 1.676 0.152 mm , and may be manufactured by agglomeration or impregnation techniques. Generally, granules will contain 75 w active ingredient and 0 10 w of additives such as stabilisers, surfactants, slaw release modifiers and binding agents.The so called dry flowable powders consist of relatively small granules having a relatively high concentration of active ingredient. Emulsifiable concentrates usually contain, in addition to a solvent and, when necessary, co solvent, 10 50 w v active ingredient, 2 20 w v emulsifiers and 0 20 w v of other additives such as stabilisers, penetrants and corrosion inhibitors. suspension conentrates are usually compounded so as to obtain a stable, non sedimenting flvBable product and usually contain 10 75 w active ingredient, 0.5 15 w of dispersing agents, 0.1 10 w of suspending agents such as protective colloids and thixotropic agents, 0 10 w of other additives such as defoamers, corrosion inhibitors, stabilisers, penetrants and stickers, and water or an organic liquid in which the active ingredient is substantially insoluble certain organic solids or inorganic salts may be present dissolved in the formLlation to assist in preventing sedimentation or as anti freeze agents for water. Aqueous dispersions and emulsions, for example compositions obtained by diluting a wettable powder or a concentrate according to the invention with water, also lie within the scope of the invention. The said emulsions may be of the water in oil or of the oil in water type, and may have a thick mayonnaise like consistency. The composition of the invention may also contain other ingredients, for example other compounds possessing herbicidal, insecticidal or fungicidal prcperties.
