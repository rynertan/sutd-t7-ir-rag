# Graphic display systems.

## Abstract
A method of determining the coincidence of a subject area and a clip area in a graphic display system, comprising creating three parts list, one for parts of the subject area that are outside the clip area, a second for parts of the clip area that are inside the subject area and a third for overlapping lines. The parts of the subject area which lie outside the clip area are defined by examining the parts lists. The output can then be used to control a pen plotter, in which different colours are used so that underlying areas do not have to be inked over with overlay colours.
