# METHODS AND COMPOSITIONS FOR INTRAVAGINAL CONTRACEPTION

## Abstract
A gel formation, which is inherently spermicidal and which provides an efficient delivery system for spermicidal and other contraceptively effective compounds intravaginally is dis closed. A contraceptive composition incorporating it com prises a a contraceptively effective amount of a sperm function inhibitor b between about 10 and 30 by weight of a poly oxyethylene polyoxypropylene block copolymer, having an av erage molecular weight between about 5,000 and 15,500 and c water, and, optionally, other non toxic pharmaceutical ly acceptable excipients.
