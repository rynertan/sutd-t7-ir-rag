## Description
Pharmaceutical Preparation containing Nifedipine This invention relates to easily absorbable pharma ccutical preparations of dimethyl l,4 dihydro 2,6 dimethyl 4 2 nitrophenyl 3,5 pyridinedicarboxylate hereinafter referred to as nifedipine for oral administration. Angina pectoris caused by coronary occlusion needs administration of a vasodilator which can exhibit its pharmacological activity within few minutes after the administrationr Nifedipintknown as an excellent remedy for the treatment of angina pectoris has a disadvantage that it is not sufficiently soluble in water and hence not absorbed rapidly in the body. Conventional dosage forms thereof for oral administration such as tablets, granules in the form of a mixture with conventional pharmaceutical excipients do not afford rapid onset of their pharmacological activity. In order to improve the absorbability, nifedipine is dissolved in polyethylene glycol and the solution is encapsulated to give soft capsules Japanese Patent Kokai 48 28621 . The soft capsules of this type have been commercially available and widely used. Because of difficulty in the encapsulating technique, the capsules have to be of relatively large sizes, for instance, about 600mg capsule, which are often difficult to be swallowed by the patients. Moreover nifedipin5is very unstable upon exposure to light in a solution. It is necessary, therefore, for the soft capsules of the above mentioned type to add a W light absorbing agent in the walls thereof for the prevention of photochemical decomposition of the active ingredient on storage.One of the disadvantages of soft capsules is that their production costs are relatively high. Accordingly it is an object of the present invention to provide a pharmaceutical preparation of nifedipine for oral administration which is easily absorbable and stable, and smaller in size than the soft capsules now available. Another object of the present invention is to provide a pharmaceutical preparation which is compatible with conventional excipients for producing tablets granules and the like without impairing its absorbability, stability and other charcteristics. According to a first preferred embodiment of the present invention, these and other objects and advantages are accomplished by providing a pharmaceutical preparation comprising a solution of nifedipin in polyethylene glycol carried on a pharmaceutically acceptable porous carrier substance in such a manner that the increase in the resting angle of the resulting preparation is not greater than 5 as compared with that of the carrier substance. The polyethylene glycols which may be used for dissolving nifedipinehecur as liquid phase at room temperature and have an average molecular weight from 200 to 600. Since the higher concentration of nefedipine in the polyethylene glycols is preferable for obtaining smaller, easily swallowable dosage forms, it is advan tageous to dissolve nifedipine ill polyethylene glycol as much as possible i.e. near saturation. For example, 1 part by weight of nifedipine dissolves in 20 parts by weight of polyethylene glycol having an average molecular weight of 400. In accordance with the present invention, the above solution is adsorbed on a pharmaceutically acceptable porous carrier substance. Examples of such carrier substances include synthetic aluminum silicate, dry aluminum hydroxide, magnesium aluminometasilicate, calcium lactate, low density silicic anhydride, micro crystalline cellulose and the like. They must occur as free flowing, fine particles. The solution of nifedipine in polyethylene glycol may be carried on the carrier substance by mixing the solution and the carrier in conventional manner. The ratio of the solution to the carrier substance is such that increase in the resting angle of the resulting mixture is not greater than 50 as compared with that of the carrier substance. The resting angle of each original carrier substance i.e. a maximum angle of inclination at which a pile of a powdery substance can rest without flowing down and spreading normally increases with increase in the quantity of the polyethylene glycol solution to be mixed therewith. Within said range of increase in the resting angle, the free flowing property of the original carrier substance will be retained to a suitable extent for further processing and the polyethylene glycol solution may be adsorbed and carried in fine interstices present on the exterior surface of the carrier substance. It is surprising that nifedipinein this mixture is more stable against photochemical degradation than in the solution in polyethylene glycol alone while the absorbabilit of said solution has not been impaired by.mixing with said carrier substances. The amount of the polyethylene glycol solution to be mixed with the carrier substance is preferably as much as possible within the aforementioned limit to minimize the size of the finished dosage forms. The specific values of the preferred ratio of the solution to the carrier substances vary with the molecular weight of polyethylene glycols and the particular carrier substances but may be easily determined by a simple preliminary test. For example, a solution consisting of 10 parts by weight of nifedipineand 200 parts by weight .of polyethylene glycol average M.W. 400 may be mixed with about 100 parts by weight of low density silicic anhydride or about 200 parts by weight of microcrystalline cellulose. According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a pharmaceutical preparation comprising nifedipine dispersed and or dissolved in 0.5 to 30 times, preferably from 2 to 5 times of polyvinylpyrrolidone hereinafter referred to as PVP based on the weight of nifedipine in substantially noncrystalline state. Nifedipine is practically stable in this state against photochemical degradation and may be rapidly absorbed into the body through digestive canals. The dispersion or solid solution may be pulverized or shaped into particles of various sizes in conventional manner and used for the production of various dosage preparations such as tablets or granules. The noncrystalline dispersion or solid solution may be produced by dissolving nifedipine and PVP in a common solvent and removing the solvent. Examples,of the solvent include acetone, chloroform, methanol, ethanol and dichlordmethane. Ethanol is most preferable because of high solubility of the solutes therein and low toxicity of residual solvent or vapor thereof. The molecular weight of PVP is not critical but preferably ranges from 10,000 to 50,000 because the capability of preventing crystallization of nifedipine and the solubility in the solvent are well balanced.As aforementioned, at least 0.5 times of PVP based on the weight of nifedipine are needed for effectively preventing crystallization of nifedipine in the resulting dispersion and more than 30 times of PVP are not des ira ble because of excessive bulkiness. A ratio of PVP to nifedipine between 2 to 5 times is generally preferable.Removal of the solvent may be carried out by the conventional evaporation tcchnique either under normal or a reduced pressure. Alternatively the solution of nifedipine and PVP in a common solvent may be spray dried or dried during granulating or tableting stage after mixing the solution with other pharmaceutical excipients. Thus the solution and the excipient are kneaded and the resulting mass may be shaped into granules of suitable size and then dried. The dry granules may also be produced by spraying the solution onto the nuclei of thxpcipients in a fluid bed while blowing hot air. The resulting particles or granules are preferably pulverized to improve the solubility in water our diges tive juice and also to improve the mixing property with other drug additives. Since the solution of nifedipine and PVP is unstable to light, care should be taken not to expose the solution to light excessively during processing the solution. Once the solution has been processed into the powder form in accordance with the present invention, it becomes stable for a long period of time. The powder or granules made in accordance with the presention invention may be further processed with other drug additives such as excipients, disintegrating agents or lubricants for producing pharmaceutical preparations such as tablets, granules, pearls or buccal tablets or they may be directly filled in hard capsules. Normally they contain lOmg of nifedipine per unit and are administered three times per day at a dose of lOmg in terms of nifedipine for the treatment of angina pectoris or other diseases. The dose may vary depending upon particular patients and conditions, The present invention is more fully illustrated by the following examples. These examples are included here for the purpose of illustration only and are not intended as a limitation.

Example 4 lOg of nifedipine and 30g of PVP average molecular weight 40,000 were dissolved in 200ml of ethanol with stirring. The solution was then spray dried. The resulting powder was mixed with 20g of microcrystalline cellulose, 19g of calcium salt ofCMC and lg of magnesium stearate. The mixture was compressed into tablets each weighing 80mg and having a diameter of 6mm. This tablet contains IOmg of nifedipine. Example 5 The solution obtained in Example 4 was kneaded with 450g of lactose. The resulting mass was extruded through 24 mesh screen and shaped into granules. The granules were dried at 40 and lOg of talc was added thereto. 500mg of this product contains lOmg of nifedipine. Example 6 In a conventional fluid bed pelletizing machine lOOg of lactose was charged as nuclei and the solution obtained in Example 4 was sprayed thereon while drying.The resulting fine granules were filled in t3 hard capsules in an amount of 140mg per capsule. Each capsule contains lOmg of nifedipine. Example 7 lOg of nifedipin and 20g of PVP average molecular weight 40,000 were dissolved in 200ml of ethanol with stirring. The resulting solution was evaporated in vacuo to remove the solvent. The residue was pulverized. The resulting powder was processed in the same manner as Example 4 to obtain tablets each weighing 70mg and containing lOmg of nefedipine. Example 8 Example 7 was repeated except that 200ml of methanol were replaced for 200ml of ethanol. The resulting powder was kneaded with 50g of dry corn starch, 60g of lactose and starch paste dry content 18g . The resulting mass was shaped into granules and dried. The granules were mixed with 2g of magnesium stearate and the mixture was compressed into buccal tablets each weighing 160mg and containing lOmg of nifedipine. Dissolving Test The products obtained in the above examples were tested on their solubilities in artificial gastric juice in comparison with controls. Control No. 1 is a commercially available soft capsule of nifedipine and Control No. 2 is a compressed tablet produced from crystallin powder of nifedipine by a conventional manner. 500ml of artificial gastric juice Solution No. 1,Japanese PharmaOpeia was placed in a 1 litre beaker and stirred with a stirrer having four blades at 150 r.p.m.at 374. To this solution was added each test sample in an amount equivalent to lOmg of nifedipine. The amount of nifedipine which was dissolved in the artificial gas tic juice was determined spectrometricaliy at the intervals as indicated in Table 1. The results obtained are shown in Table 1 in terms of per cent of dissolved nifedipinl tersus added nifedipine. Table 1 Time min.
