# MONITORING IN SERVICE RESISTANCE OF AC CONDUCTORS

## Abstract
A method and apparatus of monitoring the resistance characteristics of a circuit carrying an alternating current or a current having an alternating component is described. The apparatus includes first integration or averaging means 33 for integrating or averaging the potential drop for the period between instants when the instantaneous current has the same value in a current loop and display means 30 for displaying a value representative of the output from the integration or averaging means.
