# Signal receiving circuit for optical communication.

## Abstract
A signal receiving circuit for optical communica tion, which receives light modulated with frequencies corresponding to two values, to receive data, comprises an addition circuit provided in the front stage of a de modulator, the addition circuit adapted to superpose on an electrical signal provided by coverting light re ceived a signal having a frequency which is smaller in amplitude than the electrical signal.
