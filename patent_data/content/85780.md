# Process for making self extinguishing, by means of red phosphorus synthetic thermoplastic materials and products so obtained.

## Abstract
A process for making self extinguishing thermoplastic materials based on synthetic polymeric substances by incorporation of red phosphorus into said materials, which comprises the following steps forming a concentrate consisting for 30 70 of a mother polymeric substance and for 70 30 of red phosphorus powder previously encapsulated in a modified cationized melaminic resin incorporating said concentrate into a thermoplastic material to be made self extinguishing and consisting for at least 50 of a polymeric substance similar to or consistent with the substance comprised in said concentrate, the amount of the above mentioned concentrate being quantita tively so proportioned that the final self extinguishing ther moplastic material contains 1 15 by weight of encapsu lated red phosphorus.
