# Shape memory alloy.

## Abstract
Nickel titanium alloys are described having a nickel titanium atomic ratio between about 1 02 and 1 13 and a vanadium content between about 4.6 and 25.0 atomic per cent show constant stress versus strain behavior due to stress induced martensite in the range from about 0 to 60 C.
