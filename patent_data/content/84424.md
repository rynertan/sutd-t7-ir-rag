# CHEMICAL REMOVAL OF RESIN BLEED FROM ENCAPSULATED DEVICES AND DEVICE TREATED BY THE METHOD

## Abstract
In a method for the chemical removal of resin bleed from synthetic resin encapsulated semiconductor devices, moulded parts are first deflashed, simultaneously removing encapsulating material from between adjacent leads and removing those portions of the lead frame which hold the leads fixed during the moulding operation. The lead frame is then cleaned, and subjected to chemical treatment by applying to the device a material which is a solvent of the encapsulating resin for a time sufficient to remove the resin bleed but insufficient to cause appreciable damage to the resin encapsulation. After removal of the resin bleed the device is rinsed and the lead frame is plated or solder dipped in known fashion.
