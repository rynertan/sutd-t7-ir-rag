# Semiconductor devices and a solder for use in such devices.

## Abstract
A semiconductor device, for example a power rectifier, formed in a semiconductor body 1 has a contact area 2 coated with metal layer 5 of, for example, gold. A metallic member 4 is soldered to layer 5 with an alloy comprising at least 80 lead, the balance being indium and silver in a ratio of at least 4 1 and at most 10 1. One such solder which has good wetting characteristics for improved bond strength contains approximately 92 lead, 7 indium, and 1 silver.
