# Form creating system for CAD CAM.

## Abstract
A form creating system provides for free access to a form to be created throughout its whole process ranging from its first step or model design step to its final step or manufacturing step. Also disclosed is a device which is capable of easily detecting the position of an intersection point between a predetermined straight line and a predetermined plane, a device capable of cutting a predetermined plane linearly or curvedly to provide its sectional face with ease, a device capable of easily finding a contour line of intersection of bodies, i.e. a continuum of intersection points between a predetermined surface and its partner surface, or a controll ing or processing device operable based on each of the above mentioned devices. A predetermined surface t10 is divided into a predetermined number of surfaces t20, t21, t22, t23 to detect an intersection point between a predetermined straight line DL and a predetermined surface out of the thus divided surfaces. To obtain the contour line, one of the surfaces is divided into a large number of surfaces, inter secting surfaces are detected out of the thus divided sur faces, and then these intersecting surfaces are joined together. An operation to divide a triangle into four smaller triangles may be sequentially repeated a desired number of times so as to provide a dense polyhedron.
