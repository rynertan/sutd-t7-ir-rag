# Copolyester film and its production.

## Abstract
A copolyester film comprises a copolyester in which the decarboxylic acid component comprises 100 to 85 mole per cent of terephthalic acid and the diol component comprises 65 to 97 mole percent of 1,4 butanediol and 3 to 35 mole percent of a polyethylene glycol with a molecular weight of 106 to 550. The copolyester has a reduced viscosity in the range of 0.8 to 1.4 dl g as measured at a concentration of 0.5 g dl in a 1 1 by weight solvent mixture of phenol and tetrachloroethane at 30 C. The copolyester has a main endothermic peak with a peak maximum temperature of 160 C to 200 C and at least one subsidiary endothermic peak with a peak maximum tempera ture of 30 C to 80 C in differential scanning calorimetry with the ratio R of the area occupying not less than 40 C in the subsidiary endothermic peak, the main endothermic peak area being within the range of 3 percent to 20 percent. The film can be used as a hot melt adhesive having a high initial modulus of elasticity at high temperature 30 50 C and has improved processability or workability while retaining the required properties of a hot melt adhesive. The copolyester film is produced by melt extruding the copolyester, contact ing the extrudate with a cooling drum having a surface tem perature of 50 to 80 C for at least 8 seconds to give a film haze value of at least 6 on solidification, and heat treating the resulting film after removal from the cooling drum.
