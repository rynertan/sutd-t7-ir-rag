# A process for making cationic starch.

## Abstract
This invention is directed to a process for making cat ionic starch by reacting in an aqueous medium said starch with a halohydrin quaternary amine in the presence of an alkaline catalyst. The process is characterized by 1 initiat ing said reaction with an alkali metal oxide or hydroxide and 2 thereafter adding an alkaline earth metal oxide or hy droxide to complete the reaction. This process permits up to 46 percent dry weight of starch in the reaction mixture. Cationic starches are used as flocculating agents for anionic colloids, suspending agents and emulsifying agents.
