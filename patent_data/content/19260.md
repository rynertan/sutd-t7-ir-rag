## Description
A process for the preparation of D g ucitol llexanicotina te The present invention relates to a process for the prepara tion of D glucitol liexanicotinate, having the formula EMI1.1 This compound has been previously studied by the Applicant and is knows in the pharmacological and therapeutical fields as hypocholesteremic and thus useful for the treatment of artheriosclerosis diseases.To date the industrial preparation of this compound takes place in two steps, as resumed in the following scheme EMI1.2 Thus, according to this method, the steps are provided of chlorinating nicotinic acid, recovering and purifying the chloride and then reacting it with D glucitol, the yields as referred to the nicotinic acid being 73 74. This industrial process, however, raises several problems and drawbacks, as hereinafter shortly resulted. 1 The chlorination of the nicotinic acid is carried out with a relevant excess of SO Cl2 and requires, for the completion of the chlorination, an extended heating to reflux about ls hours .Of course the excess of SO C1 has consequences as regards 2 the polluting charge of the process effluents.Furthermore, as confirmed by the literature see for exam ple Heterocyclic Compounds, Pyridine and Derivative, Part I, pag. 45 Part III pag. 210 ,the long time needed for the reaction between nicotinic acid and SO Cl2, causes a partial chlorination of the pyridine ring and gives place up to 60 of a mixture of 5 chloro and 5,6 dichloro pyridi nic acids.The main consequence is that more or less remarkable traces of chlorinated products are present in the final D glucitol hexanicotinate, which can be difficultly removed by the com mon purification methods.2 The isolation and purification step of the final chloride hydrochloride involves the filtration of a product fuming in air HCl vapours , with the attendant drawbacks of envi . ronmental pollution and of danger for the people attending to the plant.3 In the esterification phase the resulting product may be in resinous form owing to the presence of impurities of se veral types, particularly of partial esters , thus making it necessary a further purification step to obtain a crystalline product,suitable for the therapeutical use. According to the prior art, besides the U.K. patent spe ci ficati on No. 932,079 of the sane Applicant, the Swiss patent 371,450 and the French Patent No. 1,481,007, which disclose the preparation of D glucitol hexanicotinate by reacting D glucitol and nicotinoyl chloride hydrochloride as prepared through the conventional manner, the preparation of nicotinic esters by direct esterification of the acid with a polyalcohol is described in the Japanese patent pubblication No. 2359 67 of February 2, 1967.In this case, there is mainly described and claimed the direct esterification of nicotinic acid with pentaerythritol, but among the like esterification reactions also that with D glucitol is included.The specific feature of the method claimed in this patent is that the esterification is carried out by directly star ting from the acid and the polyalcohol, in the presence of p toluen sulfonychloride, with an extended heating time.Among the esterification reactions directly involving the nicotinic acid, the following can be cited a UtK patent specification No. 1,053,689. There is described the reaction between nicotinic acid and inositol in pyridine in the presence of POCi3, but without the inte vention of catalysts. No description is given as regards the application of this method to the D glucitol.According to an experimental test, this method in the case of D glucitol hexanicotinate gives place to yields which are considerably lower about 25 less than those of the inositol hexanicotinate. b Japanese patent No. 7,006,017 of February 28,1970.There is described the preparation of inositol hexanicotinate starting from nicotinic acid and inositol,in pyridine and in the presence of POC13,nicotinamide being used as the catalyst the like reaction with D glucitol is not de scr ibed. If this method is used for the reaction of nitotinic acid with D glucitol under the same conditions and with the sa me molar rations between the reacting substances, as indicated in the patent, there have been obtained yields not higher than 67how referred to the D glucitol whereby the use of this method in the case of D glucitol is unsuitable.It has been now found and is the subject of the present in vention a pro cess for the preparation of D glucitol hexanicotinate, wherein nicotinic acid and sorbitol are reacted in pyridine in the presence of POC13, nicotinamide being used as the catalyst, characterized in that the molar ratio between nicotinic acid and D glucitol is at least 7.4 1 that the reaction mixture is heated for a time of between 230 and 280 minutes co a temperature of 78 850C that the reaction mixture of nicotinic acid and POCl3, before the addition of D glucitol, is diluted with pyridine and the reaction product is isolated by pouring,as small portions and under vigorous stirring,the reaction mixture in cold water and by filtering under vacuum.As it will appear more detailedly from the following example, among the advantages of the process of the present in vention, the following can be cited the recovering and purifying steps in the preparation of the chloride of the nicotinic acid are eliminated, thus per mitting a relevant reduction of the production costs, since there is not only reduced the reaction time and conseque ntly the reaction cost, but also the pollution degree there is obtained a final, product having a relevantly hi gher purity as regards the partial esters of D glucitol par ticularly tetra and penta esters there are avoided impurities consisting of hexanicotinate partially chlorinated at the pyridine ring. As alrcady mentioned, the results and advantages of te pre sent invention are the direct consequence of the particular and wholly unforeseable conditions under which the esterifi cation reaction is carried out according to the present invention. More particularly these conditions comprise a reac tion time of 4 hours and a heating of the reaction mixture to a temperature of 800C The unforeseability of the results of the present invention is confirmed by the comparison data with respect to the pro cess of the Japanese patent No. 7,006,017.In fact, if the esterification reaction is carried out by heating the reaction mixture to 600C for 2 hours and to 800C for 1 hour, the yield of ester, referred to the D glucitol, is only 67 .According to the preferred embodiment of the process of the present invention, the specific conditions under which the esterification reaction takes place are as follows Heating temperature of reaction mixture 800C. eating tme 240 minutes. Dilution with pyridine of the reaction mixture about one third by weight of the reaction mixture, before the addi tion of the D glucitol.ExampleA four neck, 500 ml flask, having a cooling system, a mecha nical stirrer, a thermometer and a drop feeding device, is charged with 40.0 g 0.326 moles of nicotinic acid, 0.8 g of nicotinamide and 80. 0 ml of pyridine, and the suspension is stirred at room temperature.The internal temperature of the flask is brought to 40 420C, by means of a heating bath at 500C, and there is started the dropwise addition of 27.40 g of phosphorus oxychloride, 16.4 ml corresponding to 0.0179 moles . The dropwise addition is effected at a rate such as the internal temperature of tXe reaction mixture, which is maintained under stirring, is of 45 500C, whereby the addition is effected in a time of 30 35 minutes.The resulting reaction mixture, of yellow pink colour, whi ch is dense but can be stirred, id dropwise supplemented with 50 ml of pyridine, the internal temperature being con trolled at a value of about 500C.At the end of this addition, the reaction mixture is supplemented with bg of D glucitol 0.44 moles , the addition taking place in small portions and at a rate such as the in ternal temperature is maintained at 55 600C.This addition is completed within 25 30 minutes.After the reaction mixture has been stirred for one hour,the internal temperature of the mixture is raised to O 820C and the stirring is continued for further 4 hours, starting from the time at which the temperature of the reaction mixture has reached the steady value of 80 to 82oC. After this time, the reaction mixture, which is now dense and of red brown colour, although still stirrable, is cooled down to room temperature and then poured, in small portions and under vigorous stirring, in 500 mls of cold water as the pouring is continued,a precipitate is separated which, at the end of the pouring step involving about 25 30 minutes , is filtered under reduced pressure. The residue is a solid white substance, which is washed with a double volume of water, filtered again and well squeezed on the filter.The resulting solid, after a pre drying under vacuum for a night in the presence of CaCl2, is dehydrated until a constant weight is obtained, under vacuum and at 80 900C.There are obtained 27.55 g of D glucitol hexanicotinate, ha ving melting point of 212 2160C the yield, as referredto the D glucitol, is 77.11 .
