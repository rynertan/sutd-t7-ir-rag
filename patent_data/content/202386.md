An armchair structure having an adjustable anatomical configuration comprises two lateral stringer assemblies 2 composed of sets of interlinked articulation elements 3 each of which is constituted by flat plate part 4 having connector portions 5,6 at each end. Each connector portion 5,6 has a central aperture 15 radially from which extend serrations 7 so formed that the serrations on a first connector portion 5 are formed on one face of the plate part 4 and the serrations on a second connector portion 6 are formed on the opposite face whereby adjacent articulation elements 3 can be interconnected by face to face engage ment of cooperating first and second connector portions 56 A clamping bolt secures these connector portions together in a selected relative orientation.
