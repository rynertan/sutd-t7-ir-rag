## Description
SUBSTITUTED 2 FURANYL OR 5 OXO 2 FURANYL ALKOXY PHOSPHORYL ALKYL CYCLIMMONIUM SALTS The present invention relates to certain substituted 2 furanyl or 5 oxo 2 furanyl alkoxy phosphoryl alkyl cyclimmoniumn salts and to their use as platelet activating factor PAF receptor antagonists and as inhibitors of PAF induced blood platelet aggregation. The invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing the afore mentioned compounds as an active ingredient thereof and to the method of using such compositions for inhibiting PAF mediated bronchoconstriction and extravasation, PAF induced hypotension and PAF involved ischemic bowel disease. Blood platelets, also called thrombocytes, are well recognized as important cellular elements that circulate in the blood. Their role is to staunch bleeding by forming clots in broken blood vessels, i.e., they are nature s corks. They have, however, been implicated in a variety of immunologically mediated forms of tissue injury. Their participation in these processes involved the release of platelet activating factor PAF which in turn interacts with the platelets, inducing aggregation and secretion of granular constituents. As a further consequence of platelet activation, there may result a fatal reaction consisting of acute pulmonary hypertension, right heart dilation, systemic hypotension, significant increases in pulmonary vascular resistance, decrease in dynamic lung compliance and often complete pulmonary apnea.More recently, evidence has been obtained which appears to implicate platelet activating factor in the formation of fibromuscular lesions of the arterial walls of the aorta and coronary arteries, thereby contributing to the development of atherosclerosis. Further, the possible role of PAF in ischemic bowel disease, particularly necrotizing enterocolitis NEC has recently been described, thereby implicating PAF in the development of disorders leading to bowel necrosis.

Starting materials set forth above are either known and or may be obtained analogously to known methods in conventional manner. Final products and intermediates may be isolated and purified in conventional manner. Intermediates, where appropriateZmay be employed directly in the following step without purification. As is evident to those skilled in the art, the compounds of formulaI may exist in racemic or enantiomeric form and the invention is intended to cover all forms. Enantiomeric forms may be recovered in conventional manner e.g.by resolution of end or intermediate products or by employing optically active starting materials. The compounds also exist in the form of cis trans isomers whenEMI14.1 Examples of anions as Z are chloride, bromide, iodide, phosphate, hydrogenphosphate, metaphosphate, sulfate, hydrogen sulfate and perchlorate. The compounds of formula I are indicated for use as platelet activating factor inhibitors as indicated by their ability to inhibit platelet activating factor PAF induced human platelet aggregation in vitro according to the Platelet Aggregation Inhibition Assay test PAIA test as follows Human subjects are kept aspirin free for one week and fasted overnight. Platelet rich plasma PRP is prepared by centrifugation 200 x g of freshly drawn blood, anti coagulated with 0.38 sodium citrate final concentration . Platelet count is adjusted to 250,000 per rl using platelet poor plasma PPP obtained by a second centrifugation 700 xg of the blood sample. An aliquot 0.38 ml of the PRP is dispensed into cuvettes and maintained at room temperature 22 C until used but for not more than two hours .The PRP containing cuvettes are incubated at 37 C and stirred at 900 rpm within a Payton Aggregometer which is activated to follow the light deflection pattern prior to the addition of the test compound. The test compound dissolved in a suitable solvent mixture which does not influence platelet aggregation is then added to a PRP containing cuvette in an amount sufficient to provide a final concentration of 100 uM. Between one and two minutes after the addition of the test compound, the aggregation inducing agent C 16 PAFSandoz Hanover , dissolved in a buffer consisting of 0.01 M Tris Tyrode s buffer with 0.25 bovine serum albumin pH 7.4 , is added to the PRP containing cuvettes in an amount predetermined to give a consistent aggregation response either 0.1 uM or 0.01 uM .All aggregations are allowed to proceed for 6 minutes from the addition of the inducing agent. The aggregation response is quantitated by determining the area under the curve AUC . The AUC calculated for the inducing agent alone is considered to be one hundred percent. The potential percent inhibition of the aggregation response is determined by dividing the AUC generated in the presence of the compound by the AUC of the inducing agent alone, multiplying by 100 and then substracting from 100. The compounds demonstrating greater than 50 inhibition at 100 uM are evaluated at lower concentrations to generate an IC5 50 inhibitory concentration value. Moreover, it has been found that the compounds of formula I are indicated for use as platelet activating factor recepton antagonists as indicated by their ability to inhibit specific binding of 13H PAF to platelets according to the Human Platelet PAF Receptor Assay test Test A as follows Human blood is obtained by venipuncture of healthy, human donors into an anti coagulant mixture containing 3.15 of trisodium citrate and 20 ug ml of Prostaglandin 12 PGI2 in a ratio of blood to anticoagulant of 9 1. Platelet rich plasma PRP is prepared by centrifugation 250 x g of the blood for 20 minutes at room temperature.The PRP is then centrifuged 900 x g for 10 minutes at room temperature and the platelet pellet is washed two times with Tris Tyrode s TT solution having a pH of 7.4 and containing 0.25 bovine serum albumin BSA , and to which has been added PGI2 at a final concentration of 0.3 g ml. The platelets are resuspended at 350,000 ul in TT BSA containing 1.4 mM CaCl2.2H20 and 0.7 mM MgC12.6H20. All of the tests are conducted in duplicate and each of the test compounds is evaluated at concentrations of 100, 50, 1 and 0.1 uM.For each determination, the following solutions are mixed 500 jul of the above described platelets 1 ul of 3HJ PAF 40,000 counts per minute cpm to a final concentration of 1.5 ,uM and either 10 ul of the test compound at 50x the desired final concentration, 10 ul of vehicle total bound , or 10 ul of 1.85 x lQ 5M cold PAF non specifically bound .Each mixture is allowed to incubate at room temperature for one hour, after which time the reaction is terminated by the addition of 500 ul of ice cold TT BSA and centrifugation 900 x g at 4 C for 10 minutes. The resultant supernatant is aspirated into scintillation vials and the pellet is washed with 250 ml of ice cold TT BSA and centrifuged 900 x g at 4 C for 10 minutes. The supernatants are then aspirated into the same scintillation vials as before and 10 ml of ScintiverseII a liquid scintillation cocktail is added to and mixed therewith.The pellets are resuspended in 500 jil of Scintiverse II and mixed well.An additional 2 ml of Scintiverse II is then added to the vials and, after mixing, the vials are counted for 7 minute in a liquid scintillation spectrometer. The amount of specific binding is calculated as the difference in cpm between the total bound 3H PAF and non specifically bound 3H PAF. The percent inhibition of specific binding is determined by dividing the cpm specifically bound in the presence of the test compound by the cpm specifically bound in total, multiplying by 100 and then subtracting from 100. An IC50 50 inhibitory concentration value is generated by evaluating the test compound over the full concentration range. Furthermore, in view of their potential as PAF receptor antagonists, the compounds of formla I are indicated for use as inhibitors of PAFmediated bronchoconstriction, which property was evaluated by the PAF induced Pulmonary Inflation Pressure PIP Increase test Test B as follows Male guinea pigs, weighing between 300 and 400 g, are anesthetized, after which time trachea tube, carotid and jugular catheters are inserted.The test animal is then force ventilated employing a small animal Harvard respirator and the resistance to lung inflation PIP is measured utilizing a pressure transducer and recorder. The test compound is administered either orally at 30 minutes prior to or intravenously jugular at 5 minutes prior to the introduction of PAF. The PAF C18 Sandoz,Hanover is dissolved in Tris Tyrode s bovine serum albumin buffer and administered intravenously jugular at 100 ng kg. Any blood pressure measurements taken are recorded from a transducer attached to the carotid catheter.Two responses are noted in the PIP recordings after the PAF is administered 1 an immediate response which, in PAF only treated test animals, averages out to between 70 and 80 more than the baselinePIP values. This early response is also the greatest response and is, therefore, termed maximal PIP and 2 the long term at least 30 minutes PIP response which slowly decreases to baseline. A reading at 15 minutes after the administration of PAF is termed the endpoint PIP. The effect of the test compound on the PIP response is determined by the difference between the percent increase in maximal PIP over baseline for the test animal to which has been administered PAF and the test compound compared to the test animal to which only PAF has been administered. Still further, the compounds of formula I are indicated for use as inhibitors of PAF mediated extravasation the extrusion of plasma from the lumen of the blood vessels into the vessel wall and surrounding tissues measured as a function of hemoconcentration according to the PAF induced Extravasationtest Test C as follows Male guinea pigs, weighing between 300 and 400 g, are anesthetized, after which time a femoral catheter is inserted. The test compound is administered intraarterially at one to five minutes prior to the introduction of PAF. The PAF C18 Sandoz, Hanover is dissolved in Tris Tyrode s bovine serum albumin buffer and administered intravenously jugular at 100 ng kg. To determine the hematocrit value, which is employed to index hemoconcentration and is defined as the percent of packed red blood cells in a sample of blood which is centrifuged to separate plasma from the cellular components, blood samples are collected in 50 ul heparinized hematocrit tubes. These samples are taken just prior to the injection of PAF, one minute subsequent to the injection of PAF and every two minutes thereafter until 15 minutes has lapsed subsequent to the injection of PAF. The tubes are then centrifuged and the percent of packed red blood cells hematocrit is measured PAF induces a maximal increase in hematocrit at 5 to 7 minutes subsequent to the injection of PAF .The percent increase in hematocrit over the value prior to the injection of PAF is calculated. The hematocrit values obtained with the test compound are compared to the hemoconcentration values obtained with PAF alone and are expressed as percent inhibition of percent increase in hematocri t. Yet still further, the compounds of formula I are indicated for use as inhibitors of PAF induced hypotension as measured by their ability to inhibit the lowering of blood pressure levels induced by PAF according to the following test Test D Male We star rats, weighing approximately 300 g, are anesthesized and their carotid arteries cannulated to enable their diastolic and systolic arterial blood pressure measurements to be recorded. PAF is then administered intravenously at either 100 or 500 ng kg, and the blood pressure drop within 10 sec. and recovery time required to reach the pre injection blood pressure level are measured. At 100 ng kg, a 30 decrease in blood pressure and a 3 to 4 minute recovery time are observed, whereas at 500 ng kg, 52 decrease in blood pressure and a 10 minute recovery time are observed.In order to measure the effectiveness of a compound for both the inhibition of blood pressure decreases and shortening of the recovery time, the test compound is administered intravenously over a range of between 5 and 7 dosage levels 1 or 2 test animals per dose and between 1 and 5 minutes prior to the introduction of PAF to generate an ED50 Yet even still further, the compounds of formula I are indicated for use as inhibitors of PAF induced ischemic intestinal necrosis, which property was measured in accordance with the following test Test E Following essentially the procedure of F. Gonzalez Crussi andW. Hsueh published in J. Amer. Pathol., 112, pgs. 127 135 1983 , maleSprague Dawley rats, weighing approximately between 260 and 300 g, are anesthetised and their carotid arteries cannulated and connected to a blood pressure transducer and recorder.The test compound is introduced into a cannula inserted into the jugular vein at a time 10 minutes prior to the administration of PAF. The abdomen is then incised along the midline and 2 p9 of PAF or 20 ig of LPS lipopolysaccharide immediately followed by 1 rg of PAF are injected into the abdominal aorta at the level of the renal artery. The abdominal incision is then covered with saline moistened gauze and the intestine exposed and examined periodically up to 2 to 3 hours prior to sacrifice. Into the jugular vein is then injected 5 ml of 2 Evans Blue to assess the degree of intestinal perfusion. Blocks of intestinal tissue are then taken for microscopic examination to determine either the extent of necrosis or to verify the absence of necrosis when inhibited by the test compound.Microscopic changes in the intestine are assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining. The test compound is assessed for its ability to alleviate or prevent the development of gross and micro scopic lesions and may be expressed in terms of the number of animals in which inhibition is observed relative to the control taken to be 100 . The compounds are thus indicated for use in inhibiting or antagonising PAF and an indicated suitable daily dosage for this use is from about 1 to 500 mg preferably 1 to 50 mg suitably administered in divided dosages of 0.25 to 500 mg preferably 0.25 to 50 mg one to four times daily or in controlled release form. A typical oral dosage is 5 mg three times a day. The compounds are further indicated for use in treating PAF mediated bronchoconstriction and extravasation, PAF induced hypotension and ischemic bowel disease and an indicated suitable daily dosage for this use is from about 10 to 2000 mg preferably 10 to 350 mg suitably administered in divided dosages of 0.25 to 500 mg esp. 0.25 to 350 mg one to four times daily or in controlled release form. A typical oral dosage is 50 or 100 mg two or three times a day. The invention therefore also concerns a method of inhibiting or antagonising platelet activating factor and of treating platelet activating factor mediated bronchoconstriction and extravasation, platelet activating factor induced hypotension and ischemic bowel disease, which comprises administering to a subject in need of such treatment a compound of formula I, as well as such compounds for use as pharmaceuticals e.g.in inhibiting or antagonising platelet activating factor and treating platelet activating factor mediated bronchoconstriction and extravasation, platelet activating factor induced hypotension and ischemic bowel disease. The compounds may be administered alone, or in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier, and, optionally other excipients, and administered orally in such forms as tablets, dispersible powders, granules, elixirs, capsules or suspensions or parenterally in such forms as sterile injectable solutions or suspensions. The preferred pharmaceutical compositions from the standpoint of ease of preparation and administration are solid compositions, particularly tablets and hard filled or liquid filled capsules. Such compositions also form part of the invention. The following Examples, in which all temperatures are in C illustrate the invention.
