# Airspeed control for aircraft.

## Abstract
A cruise speed control system for an aircraft in which small differences between a target Mach command and the actual Mach number of the aircraft are used to displace the aircraft from its reference altitude either to increase or decrease actual Mach number in the short term. Long term differences are corrected through a special isolation filter 53 to separate the engine control loop and pitch control loop dynamics, and an integration technique 52 to adjust the automatic throttles about a thrust target for the comman ded Mach. Large differences between the target Mach and the actual Mach, or large changes in the commanded Mach, are compensated for by non linear gain means 72 which effectively increases or decreases the target thrust to cause the aircraft to accelerate or decelerate to the commanded Mach.
