# Solar energy concentrator.

## Abstract
In the linear type embodiment of this invention, the solar energy concentrator 1 consists of a plurality of horizontally disposed and laterally arranged narrow inclined strips 2 extending outwardly from both sides of a narrow middle strip 3 . These plurality of inclined strips have highly reflective polished finish surfaces or coatings 5 , and each having a predetermined angle or inclination with the reflec tive surfaces adapted to reflect multifocally solar energy to a line above the narrow intermediate strip S. As shown there are two groups A and B of said narrow inclined areas disposed on both sides of the intermediate area I and facing towards the intermediate strip S. In other embodiments, the strips may form concentric strips, or sets of concentric arcs which reflect the solar energy towards one or several points above the center of the strips.

## Description
SOLAR ENERGY CONCENTRATOR This invention relates generally to devices used for effectively utilizing solar energy and more particularly to a highly efficient multt focal solar energy concentrator which could be manufactured at costs substantially lower than present solar energy concentrators. Present researches throughout the world are directed to the development of new types of solar collectors and concentrators with higher efficiencies, such as for example solar collectors or concentrators capable of producing high temperatures. However, for these types of solar devices to gain the acceptance of the end users these devices must be simple and of low cost. In the attempt to develop highly efficient solar devices, some have developed practical devices, such as the parabolic dish collector, the cylindrical parabolic collector, the heliostat, the fresnel lens of optical grade acrylic and many other sophisticated electronic devices for tracking the sun. All the above mentioned devices are costly, complicated and difficult to manufacture. The object then of this invention is to provide a highly efficient multifocal solar energy concentrator which is very simple, easy to install and which could be manufactured at a considerably much lower costs than present solar devices of the same nature, and which could also be adopted or used in parabolic cylindrical heliostats and other types of solar energy concentrator. gore specifically, the object of this invention is to provide a low cost but highly efficient horizontal and lateral type of multifocal solar energy concentrator and which is also highly comparable to that of the aforecited types. Another object of this invention is to provide a solar energy collector made of any suitable highly reflective material and multifocally constructed that effectively reflects more sunbeam and having a range that far exceeds that of the aforecited concentrators which is therefore suitable for a wider field of applications. A further object of this invention is to provide a solar energy concentrator which is adapted and highly recommended for household purposes, and in the industry, agriculture and service sectors. These and other objects will be fully appreciated after reading and studying the following detalled description of the. appended drawings which form part of this specification and wherein reference numerals designates to same parts throughout.

As shown in Figures 1 and 2 is the linear type embodiment of this invention. This embodiment of the solar energy concentrator 1 consist of a plurality of horizontally disposed and laterally arranged narrow inclined strips 2 extending outwardly from both sides of a narrow middle strip 3. These plurality of inclined strips have highly reflective polished finish surfaces and each having a predetermined angle or inclination with reflective surfaces adapted to reflect multifocally solar energy to a line L above the narrow intermediate strip S. As shown there are two groups A and B of said narrow inclined areas disposed on both sides af the intermediate area I and facing towards the intermediate strip S. At the line L maybe placed any suitable elongated heat absorbing device for utilizing the heat generated. Another embodiment is shown in Figures 3 and 4. This embodiment is of the concentric type.The inclined narrow areas are horizontally disposed and in the form of concentric strips 4 and the inclinations of which are adapted to multifocally reflect the solar energy towards a point P above the center of the concentric strips. The inclined concentric narrow strips have multifocal reflective surfaces which may be a well polished or reflective lining or coating 5. As shown in Figures 5 and 6 the inclined reflective strips consists actually of several 6 sets of concentric arcs having a middle section of 4 concentric circular stripthe center of which are disposed in a straight line. An example of an experiment made on one of the present concentrator showed the following results Physical features of the present concentrator Diameter of the reflector r 40 cm Area of the reflector r 1256.64 cm2 Reduction in area caused by shadow 150 cm2 Effective area of reflector 1106.64 cm2 rea of Tocus 50.2655cm2 Geometric concentra 1106.64 tion ratio 50. 2656 22 The geometric concentration ratio is the ideal corLcentration ratio of the collector With a geometric concentration ratio of 22, the achievable temperature range falls between 2000C to 3000C. Typical temperature achievable by concentrating solar collectors are given in Popular Science Magazine, as shown in Fig. 8. While the present concentrator can achieve intermediate range temperatures between 2000C to 3000C still higher temperature can be obtained by improving its concentration ratio of 22. Higher temperatures yield more useful energy, for example in driving steam turbines for electricity generation.
