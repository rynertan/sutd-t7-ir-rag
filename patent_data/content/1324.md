# Ammonia synthesis and a plant for carrying out this synthesis.

## Abstract
In an ammonia synthesis process at a pressure under 120 bar abs., ammonia is recovered from incompletely reacted synthesis gas by absorption in water. Referring to figure 1, unreacted synthesis gas enters at 12 and is dried preparatory in drier 14 to further reaction by passing it through a charge of regenerable solid absorbent until that charge is loaded with water and switching its flow to a fresh or regenerated charge. During the operation of the process using gas flow paths A, drier 14 gradually becomes charged with water. When drier 14 has become charged to the design level, the gas flow is switched to paths B. The loaded charge is regenerated by passing ammonia containing reacted synthesis gas through it. Hot reacted synthesis gas then flows through drier 14 and moist recycle gas through drier 16. The displaced water is separated in the ammonia absorption step. Alternatively a additionally the water content of the unreacted synthesis gas is decreased by contacting it with liquid aqueous ammonia at below 0 C.
