# Machine for performing a roughing operation progressively along marginal portions of a shoe bottom.

## Abstract
A machine for progressively roughing marginal portions of shoe bottoms comprises a shoe support 18 having toe support means 470 and a heel support arrangement including two sets of clamps 390, 392 , one set 392 of which serves also as sensing means for sensing, by engage ment with an off set portion of the shoe last whether the shoe thus supported is a left or a right. An inductance sensing device 610 associated with the second set of clamps 392 supplies a signal to control means of the machine, the signal being dependent upon whether the shoe is a left or a right. The control means ensures that, in the operation of the machine, a roughing operation is carried out on the shoe bottom in such a manner that the inside waist region of the shoe bottom is traversed always in the same direction, regardless of whether the shoe is a left or a right and of course similarly the outside waist region is consis tently operated upon . In this way, uniformity of rough as between left and right shoes can be achieved.
