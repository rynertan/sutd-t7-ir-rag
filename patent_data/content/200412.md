## Description
The United States Government has rights in this invention pursuant to NIH Grant No. A1 18716 awarded by the Department of Health and Human Services. The invention relates to methods of modulating a specific immune response, including control of unwanted immune reactions to pharmaceuticals, allergic reactions, and organ allograft tolerance inductions. In particular, binding moieties which react with that T cell differentiation antigen of the subject species which corresponds to the murine differentiation antigen L3T4 are useful in preventing both primary and secondary immune responses to an immunogen administered simultaneously, or within the period of depletion of L3T4 antigen bearing T cells. The efficient functioning of the immune system is a double edged sword. Its ability to provide a defense against invasion by hostile foreign organisms such as infectious bacteria, viruses, or even malignant cells is relied upon by vertebrate organisms for their health indeed, their viability depends upon the success of this protection. On the other hand, there are some undesirable side effects to this efficiency, even as it relates to foreign substances encountered by the host. Not all intrusions of foreign tissue are necessarily hostile. Problems encountered in rejections of skin grafts for burn victims has a long history the more recent proliferation of procedures which involve organ transplants has brought the problem of foreign tissue rejection to the attention of the general public. Furthermore, it has come to be understood that allergic responses result from operation of the immune system. Allergens apparently trigger responses which culminate in formation of antibodies. Some IgE are capable of binding to mast cells to elicit the unpleasant symptomology associated with allergies. These symptoms may be merely unpleasant, or may be severe, as are those encountered in patients allergic to certain medications, such as penicillin. The advent of pharmaceutical compositions containing peptide molecules large enough to be immunogenic has magnified the importance of this problem. Peptide pharmaceuticals useful in a variety of treatments such as antiviral and anticancer therapies have recently been made much more readily available through recombinant techniques. It is common knowledge that attempts to prevent unwanted immune responses have not been particularly successful. For example, efforts are made to match transplant recipients with donors so as to minimize the amount of immunogenic response to foreign materials. Only in the case of identical twins can reasonable success be certain. The limitations of such an approach are so apparent as to warrant no further comment. Alternatively, brute force efforts to suppress the immune system in general, such as administration of anti mitotic agents, may prevent rejection at the expense of the recipient s life due to the resulting susceptibility to infection. An alternate approach applicable only to preventing tissue rejection is passive immunization of recipients with antibodies directed against the histocompatibility antigens Davies, D.A.L., et al, Methods to prevent immune responses to soluble antigens have been largely confined to avoidance of exposure. Patients allergic to certain drugs are treated with alternative formulations when available hay fever sufferers attempt to stay away from the immunogenic pollen. If avoidance is impossible, one must resort to treating the symptoms. What is desired is a specific immuntolerance with respect to a particular antigen, leaving the general competence of the immune system intact. None of the foregoing approaches achieve such a selective immunosuppression of the subject. Treatments employed to prevent transplant rejection which are directed toward the host per se generally depress the entire system treatments of the donor tissue alter the nature of the foreign material introduced. In the case of allergic responses to drugs or to environmental antigens, alteration of the foreign material is either undesirable or impractical. In the present invention, the immune system of the host is selectively and specifically suppressed with respect to a particular immunogen without impairing general immunocompetence. The invention achieves this result by virtue of its specificity for a differentiation antigen on the surface of helper T cells, thus preventing those cells from participating in mounting in immune response against a specified antigen introduced simultaneously, or at least within the period of helper T cell recovery. The present invention provides a method for suppressing undesired immune responses, such as allergic reactions, to antigens whose administration to the subject is either desired, or is inevitable but otherwise harmless. It also provides a method for inducing tolerance to tissue transplants. In one important application, the advent of recombinant technology has made available a substantial number of potentially powerful therapeutic polypeptides such as, for example, the interferons or interleukins, which often elicit an unwanted immune response. Of course, allergic reactions to more commonly used drugs are not unknown, but the new polypeptide pharmaceuticals, presumably because of their size, are more troublesome in this regard. The invention permits the subject to experience the desirable therapeutic effects of a desired drug without the immunologic reaction. Another application is to the problem of allergies to foods or materials in the surroundings. Millions of individuals are subjected to severe symptomology in response to otherwise perfectly harmless components of the environment, for example, ragweed or other pollens. The method of the invention can prevent or diminish this immune response which results in widespread discomfort. A third application, to reduce the incidence of tissue rejection in transplant procedures, is significant in making these often life saving procedures safe and practical. These procedures could, in this era, otherwise be straightforward absent the problems of incompatability. A fourth application is to allow the use of foreign proteins such as xenogeneic monoclonal antibodies for therapy of certain diseases such as cancer. The method of the invention resides in the co administration of the antigen for which immunotolerance is sought and an antibody which is specific for the L3T4 equivalent differentiation antigen on T cells, thus preventing these helper T cells from participating in the immune response otherwise concurrently mounted against the particular co injected or co administered antigen. The protective antibodies may be administered directly, or these antibodies or L3T4 equivalent binding portions thereof may be conjugated with cytotoxic moieties to obtain immunotoxic conjugates. The cytotoxic moieties may aid in the destruction of the helper T cell function which is also prevented by reaction with the antibodies or fragments alone. The essential component of the protective composition is the moiety specifically binding L3T4 equivalent. Two general situations are of interest. One relates to a naive subject, previously unexposed to the antigen of concern. This is commonly the case with respect to transplant hosts or patients who are to be treated with new or infrequently administered drugs. The other relates to individuals previously exposed to the same antigen. This is most often the case for allergic responses to components of the environment. With respect to defensive immunosuppression against a previously unencountered agent, such as a new pharmaceutical or transplant, it is sufficient to suppress the primary immune response to introduction of the foreign substance. In the method of the invention, this primary response is suppressed by administration of the foreign substance simulatneously with the administration of the binding moiety, e.g., antibody or immunotoxin that is specifically immunoreactive with the differentiation antigen corresponding to the murine L3T4 surface glycoprotein in the subject species i.e., an L3T4 equivalent or within the helper T cell recovery period thereafter. Accordingly, the invention in one aspect relates to a method of preventing or ameliorating the immune response to an immunogen by properly timed coadministration of the anti L3T4 equivalent binding moiety and the immunogenic substance. With respect to alleviation of responses to previously experienced immunogens, the technique is the same although the history of the subject, and therefore the subject itself, is different. The nature of the response is also different. While the most frequent instance of such prior exposure is in the case of environmental allergens, this aspect of the invention is not limited to such allergens per se. Previous exposure to the same allergen is the norm, and the invention is particularly useful in this application. Even this response to a secondary challenge with the immunogen can be mitigated by administration of the moiety binding L3T4 equivalent simultaneously with or just before the booster exposure. The immunogen can also be deliberately administered at the appropriate time to confer future immunity along with immediate suppression. Accordingly, the invention in another aspect relates to amelioration of a secondary immune response, most commonly, an allergic response, by administering to a subject, previously exposed to an immunogen, a moiety specifically binding to the relevant L3T4 equivalent in appropriate combination with exposure to immunogen. In another aspect, the invention contemplates kits containing compositions suitable for effecting the method of the invention. Figure 1 shows the total specific anti myoglobin immunoglobulin levels obtained in mice with and without simultaneous injection with GK1.5 monoclonal antibody Mab . The method of the invention depends on the interruption of a specific immune response by crippling the participation of a subclass of T lymphocytes, the helper cells, and permitting these cells to regenerate in the presence of an immunogen. These T cells are recognized by a surface borne glycoprotein differentiation antigen, designated L3T4 in the murine system. Briefly, it has long been established that two major types of lymphocytes participate in the immune response T cells, which differentiate to various effector functions, and B cells, which differentiate so as to secrete specific antibodies to the antigen. In a very general way, the primary function of the B lymphocyte differentiated cells plasma cells is to secrete antibody the differentiated T cells provide effector functions such as those of the killer cells, helper cells, and suppressor cells. T cells, in addition to antigen specific recognition sites, contain differentiation antigens characteristic of their particular subtype. Accordingly, the method of the invention influences the course of the immune response by blocking the characteristic differentiation antigen of the helper T cell subtype, thus inhibiting the effector function of the helper T cells. The helper cells apparently interact with B cells to help effect B cell differentiation and proliferation in addition, they help in the differentiation of T cells into their effector roles, e.g., as killer cells. A majority of these helper T lymphocytes HTLs contain a surface differentiation antigen designated in the murine system as L3T4. This differentiation antigen is a glycoprotein of apparent molecular weight 52,000 Dialynas, D.P., et al, Others have investigated the effect of the injection of GK1.5 Mabs on the immune response. Wofsy, D., et al, in a paper presented to WSCI, February 4 6, 1985, reported that weekly injections of anti L3T4 antibody into a strain of mice prone to develop autoimmune disease decreased the circulating levels of L3T4 positive cells by 90 95 and suppressed the development of autoimmunity. They further observed that the Wofsy, D., et al, in an abstract submitted to the Western AFCR, February 4 6, 1985, report the effect of GK1.5 secreted Mab injection on the immune response to a soluble antigen. Mice injected with bovine serum albumin BSA normally produced anti BSA IgM immediately followed by a rapid increase in the level of anti BSA IgG antibodies. The IgG response could be prevented by a single injection of the GK1.5 secreted Mabs within 48 hours of immunization, but suppression of IgG function did not occur if injection was made more than 48 hours after the administration of BSA. Wofsy also observed that injections of GK1.5 Mabs into mice did not elicit an immune response, whereas treatment with other rat IgG2b Mabs did stimulate high titers of anti rat antibody. As used herein simultaneously when referenced to injection of antigen and L3T4 equivalent binding moiety refers to injection or administration of one within approximately 24 48 hours of the other. Either may be administered first. It is preferable, however, that the administration of the moiety binding the receptor be carried out substantially contemporaneously with or within 48 hours prior to injection or other administration of the antigen. Helper T cell recovery period refers to the time period required after binding moiety administration for L3T4 equivalent bearing helper cells to be restored to their approximate normal levels, preferably, in the context of the invention, to 50 of their normal levels. Binding moiety to L3T4 equivalent refers to a substance which is specific to the differentiation antigen corresponding in the subject species to the L3T4 surface differentiation antigen of murine HTL cells. Some moieties may be immunoreactive against a determinant on these differentiation antigens which makes them cross reactive with the correspondant differentiation antigens on HTL cells in several species. In general, because of the powerful immunosuppressant activity of the antibodies useful in this invention, it is not necessary that they be derived from the subject species. For example, the rat IgG2b monoclonal antibody GK1.5 is reactive against murine L3T4 and these Mabs are convenient for use in murine test systems since they do not raise antibodies to rat Ig in mice. Other commercially available monoclonal antibodies, such as Leu3 Becton Dickinson or T4 Ortho are reactive against human Leu3 or T4 differentiation antigen. Various alternative hybridoma lines producing monoclonal antibodies which specifically react with the corresponding differentiation antigens in T cells of the subject are suitable in the method of the invention. It is not, of course, necessary that monoclonal antibodies be used as the L3T4 equivalent binding moiety. Monoclonal antibody preparations have the advantage of higher affinities and homogeneity, but polyclonal preparations may be used. Also, fragments of immunoglobulins which retain target specificity, for example, F ab ₂ fragments are useable as well. In addition, antibodies specific against L3T4 equivalents or fragments thereof may be conjugated with cytotoxins. The construction of immunotoxins using various cytotoxic moieties, such as whole ricin, ricin A, diphtheria toxin, pokeweed antiviral protein PAP or other naturally occurring or artificial toxins are by now well understood in the art. For reviews, see Thorpe, P.E., et al, Thus, in summary, the term moiety binding to L3T4 equivalent refers to monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies or fragments thereof or any of these bound to cytotoxins, so long as the specific ability to bind the L3T4 equivalent in the species of interest is retained. Specific antigen refers to the immunogenic substance of interest. Thus, specific antigens include globular proteins, glycoproteins such as immunoglobulins, materials carried on particles such as pollen proteins, polypeptides intended for therapeutic use such as interferon, interleukin 2, or tumor necrosis factor, hormone replacements, such as leutinizing hormone or its analogs or antagonists. Synthetic peptide analogs of protein therapeutic agents which are used for receptor blockade are another important class of soluble antigen. Still another important subclass is that of allo antigens, i.e., those which are products of the major histocompatibility complex. It is these allo antigens which are presumably responsible for rejection of foreign tissue in tissue transplants or skin grafts. A significant aspect of the invention is that it is efficacious regardless of whether or not the subject has been previously exposed to the antigenic substance because it provides immunotolerance to a specific antigen upon secondary as well as primary exposure. Primary responses to antigens generally involve formation of quantities of IgM antibodies specific to the antigen. Booster exposures to the antigen or, indeed, the delayed response to the initial administration result in a secondary response comparatively dramatic increases in the IgG, IgA, and IgE population specific to the antigen. In other words, the secondary response is characterized by an increase in specific IgG, IgA, and IgE levels. The IgM population fairly quickly diminishes and is again supplemented only when an additional administration of the antigen is made IgG, IgA, and IgE levels are maintained for longer periods. Previous exposures to the same antigen result in an enhanced secondary response upon subsequent exposure. The essential feature of the invention is administration of the binding moiety of correct specificity to block the subject s L3T4 differentiation antigen or, more precisely, the subject species correspondant surface glycoprotein either simultaneously with administration of the specific antigen or previous to antigen administration, wherein the antigen is administered during the recovery period. The actual effect of the binding moiety may be to kill the L3T4 equivalent bearing cells or to block the effector function of these cells in some non cytotoxic event, in either case permitting regeneration of normal helper T cell moieties over a period characteristic of the species about 2 weeks to 1 month in mice. While not intending to be bound by any particular theory as to the mechanism of operation of the invention method, Applicants believe helper T cell regeneration in the presence of a particular antigen results in its being recognized as self. It may enhance the effectiveness of the L3T4 equivalent binding moiety to prepare it as an immunoconjugate with a cytotoxic material. The cytotoxin will thus be directed specifically to the target T helper cells. The dosage of the moiety binding to L3T4 equivalent which is administered will depend on its form, on whether or not it is converted to an immunotoxin, on its mode of administration, and on the condition of the subject. Clearly the most preferred mode of administration is by injection, preferably intravenous injection. Typically, the subject to be thus specifically immunosuppressed is injected with about 200 mg 5 g, preferably about 1 2 g of L3T4 equivalent binding moiety in a suitable excipient, such as physiological saline, in a single injection intravenously or intraperitoneally. The antibody portion of the desired binding moiety is obtained by conventional procedures. L3T4 equivalent sera may be obtained from immunized subjects. For the Leu3 or T4 equivalent human differentiation antigen, antisera may be prepared from subject mammals such as mice, horse, goat, rabbit, sheep, or rats by injecting with human helper T cells and collecting the sera from the immunized host. Since the L3T4 equivalent binding moiety confers selective specific immunosuppression, the use of non human antisera is permissible. Antibodies desired for other mammalian subjects may be similarly derived using injections of helper T cell subpopulations from these mammals. Monoclonal anti L3T4 equivalent antibodies may also be made by the somatic cell hybridization procedure first described by Kohler, G., et al, Antigen binding fragments F ab , F ab , F ab ₂, F v of polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies are made by digesting the whole immunoglobulin with an appropriate protease, for example, papain in the case of F ab and pepsin in the case of F ab ₂. The class and subclass of the antibody used is not critical. Polyclonal antisera presumably are mixtures of Ig classes Mabs produced are of a single subclass. If the L3T4 equivalent binding moiety is administered as an immunotoxin, the antibody portion is conjugated using standard conjugation techniques to a cytotoxin. Thorpe, P.E., et al supra Olsnes, S., et al supra . Typical coupling agents include, for example, 3, 3 dimethyl dithio bis propionate, and N succinnimidyl 3 2 pyridyl dithio propionate SPDP which yield a reducible disulfide bond and, for example, the N hydroxysuccinnimdyl esters of, for example, 6 maleimidylcaproic acid which yield thioethers. Other coupling agents, such as glutaraldehyde or carbodiimides yield alternate chemistries. The cytotoxin moiety may, for example, be a bacterial or plant toxin, or a portion thereof that includes its enzymatically active fragment or a similarly active protein. Examples of such toxins are diphtheria toxin, The amount and nature of the material used for simultaneous injection to confer the desired specific immunosuppression depends on the type of antigen. For allergens, whether environmental or deliberately administered soluble antigens, such as drugs, the antigenic component may be conveniently administered intravenously in suitable excipients in amounts of 10 µg 1mg. Alternatively, for environmental allergens, exposure may mimic natural exposure and employ aerosols or oral compositions and quantities approximating the estimated degree of exposure are appropriate. For example, one might use a field of flowers approach in protecting a subject against an immune response to a naturally occurring pollen. That is, at the beginning of the acacia blooming season, for example, the subject is placed in proximity to the offending blooms while simultaneously being administered protective binding moieties or within the recovery period after such administration. Gradations between these natural exposures and the highly artificial method of isolating the specific allergen and injection with or just after the binding moiety administration may also be used. The formulation of appropriate pharmaceutical compositions to administer the antigen is well known to those in the art. If the allergen is a therapeutic agent, amounts of antigen approximating those intended to be administered and a similar route of administration may be used. In general, this protection affords a simpler problem as generally speaking the antigen is already available in a suitably formulated pharmaceutical composition and the levels of exposure expected and expected routes of administration are already known. For suppression of rejection in the case of transplanted tissue, specifically, with respect to allografts, a variety of modes of administration are feasible. Allografts are multiplicities of cells or associated cells that define a tissue or organ from an individual of the same species as that of the intended recipient, but which derive from an individual genetically dissimilar from the recipient. These cell multiplicities themselves, include vascularized organs such as heart, kidney, liver and lungs. Endocrine glands pituitary, thyroid, adrenal, parathyroid, and pancreas or skin grafts may not contain the major histocompatibility antigens which are responsible for triggering the rejection of the transplant. These antigens are carried by passenger cells such as leukocytes which are included in the transplanted cells as impurities. Two general approaches may be used the transplant materials can themselves be used as a source of antigen, or the particular histocompatibility antigens may be obtained separately and administered alone or as cells bearing the histocompatibility antigens of the transplant donor, i.e., peripheral blood lymphocytes. A major antigen responsible for tissue rejection carried on such passenger leukocytes is the murine Ia equivalent antigen which in humans is designated HLA DR MHC class II antigens . Human HLA DR antigens have been subclassified and if the donor has been typed, suitable antigen, e.g., peripheral blood lymphocytes, associated with the donor tissue is conveniently obtainable and injected prior to transplant along with or within the recovery period of administering the L3T4 equivalent binding moiety. The perhaps more crude, but effective, manner of administration is simultaneous injection of the L3T4 equivalent binding moiety along with or just before the transplant itself or a pre transplant simultaneous injection of a portion of the tissue suitably finely divided and formulated along with the protecting binding moiety. As seen from the previous paragraphs, each specific antigen offers alternative routes for administration appropriate to its nature. All offer the possibility of obtaining purified antigen and utilizing intravenous administration. In certain instances, it is also possible to inject a composition containing a mixture of the specific antigen along with the binding moiety in a suitable pharmaceutical composition. In summary, for antigens in general, while intravenous administration is most convenient, other forms of administration are useful as well. Other routes of parenteral administration include subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, or intramuscular injection. Injectables can be prepared in conventional forms, either as liquid solutions or suspensions, solid forms suitable for solution or suspension in liquid prior to injection, or as emulsions. Suitable excipients are, for example, water, saline, dextrose, glycerol or ethanol. In addition, if desired, the pharmaceutical compositions to be administered may also contain minor amounts of nontoxic auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents and pH buffering agents. For substances intended to stimulate the immune system, such as the specific antigen administered in the method of the invention, an adjuvant, such as complete Freund s adjuvant is generally used. An additional approach for parenteral administration employs the implantation of a slow release or sustained release system, such that a constant level of dosage is maintained. Systemic administration may be effected via suppository. For such formulations, traditional binders and carriers include, e.g., polyalkalene glycols or triglycerides. Such suppositories may be formed from mixtures containing L3T4 equivalent binding moiety or antigen in the range of 0.5 10 preferably 1 2 . For aerosol administration, the antigen is preferably supplied in finely divided form along with a surfactant and a propellant. Typical percentages of active ingredients are 0.01 to 20 by weight, preferably 0.4 to 1.0 . Surfactants must, of course, be nontoxic, and preferably soluble in the propellant. Representative of such agents are the esters or partial esters of fatty acids, such as caproic or octanoic acids, polyols such as mannitol or sorbitol, or their anhydrides or esters and their polyoxyethylene and polyoxypropylene derivatives. Preferred surface active agents include the oleates of sorbitan, e.g. , those sold under the trademarks Arlacel C , Span 80 , and Span 85 . The surfactant may constitute 0.1 20 by weight of the composition, preferably 0.25 5 . The balance of the composition is ordinarily propellant for example the lower alkanes, such as butane and propane and preferably fluorinated or fluorochlorinated alkanes, such as are sold under the trademark Freon . In producing the aerosol, a container equipped with a suitable valve is filled with the appropriate propellant, containing the finely divided active ingredient and surfactant. The ingredients are thus maintained at an elevated pressure until released by action of the valve. Solid compositions of antigen or L3 T4 equivalent binding moiety may be used if administered orally or if reconstituted for administration. Conventional nontoxic solid carriers include, for example, pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, or magnesium stearate. The corresponding liquid pharmaceutically administerable compositions can be prepared by dissolving, dispersing, etc, the antigen or binding moiety above and optional pharmaceutical adjuvants in a carrier as described above. Actual methods of preparing the above dosage forms are known, or will be apparent, to those skilled in this art for example, see It is convenient to package the specific antigen and protective L3T4 equivalent binding moiety into kits for administration of the treatment. Thus, for example, kits for the treatment of allergy would comprise containers with, preferably, unit dosage levels of allergen such as ragweed protein, milk protein, or other allergenic material in suitable excipients including most preferably adjuvant preparations such as Freund s complete adjuvant. An additional container would supply, e.g., suitable monoclonal antibodies specific for L3T4 or immunotoxins derived from them in form for administration such as a suspension in physiological saline or other pharmaceutical excipient or in solid form to be reconstituted. For certain antigen binding moiety combinations, these components may be supplied as a mixture. Additional components of such kits might be sterile disposable syringes. All materials may be packaged in convenient containers for administration as is known in the art, along with instructions for their use. The following examples are meant to illustrate and are not intended to limit the invention. Sperm whale myoglobin was used as a antigen in Balb C mice, and the ability of GK1.5 secreted Mab to produce specific immunosuppression with respect to this antigen was verified using four protocols. The four protocols differed only in the timing of the injections of the antigen and protecting antibody. In each protocol, one experimental group consisting of three 6 8 week old mice, and two control groups consisting of three similar mice were used. One control group received corresponding injections of α Thy Mab instead of GK1.5 secreted Mab at identical times and in the same amounts. The other control group received injections of corresponding volumes of buffer solution. All groups in all protocols received 100 µg myoglobin in complete Freund s adjuvant on day 0 and booster injections of 50 µg myoglobin in the adjuvant every 14 days thereafter. Sera were collected on day 7 and day 10 after each immunization and assayed for the presence of anti myoglobin total immunoglobulin including both IgM and IgG by ELISA as described in Example 3 below. The specific protocols are as follows All four protocols gave similar results. The controls show high levels of specific antimyoglobin immunoglobulins correlating with serum dilution. Antimyoglobin antiserum is absent from the GK1.5 secreted Mab injected groups. Experimental and control groups of three mice each were similar to those used in Example 1. All groups received 100 µg myoglobin on day 0 and booster injections of 100 µg myoglobin every 14 days thereafter. On day 14, 100 µg of GK1.5 secreted Mab or control injections were administered and sera were withdrawn at various intervals and assayed by ELISA for IgG specific against myoglobin. The results are shown in Figure 2, where ELISA units are plotted against time. The open circles joined by dotted and solid lines show the levels of antimyoglobin IgG in the sera of buffer and α Thy injected controls respectively. The solid circles show the IgG levels in the sera of mice injected with GK1.5 secreted Mab. The IgG levels of the control mice rise monotonically as the animals are boosted. However, the mice injected at day 14 with GK1.5 fail to show the IgG secondary response to the boosting antigen injections. For total antimyoglobin Ig microtiter plates Dynatech Laboratories, Alexandria, VA were coated with 100 µg ml sperm whale myoglobin in PBS for 1 hour at room temperature or overnight at 4 C, and washed with PBS. The remaining nonspecific binding sites were saturated with 3 BSA in PBS, and the plates were washed. Fifty µl of the serum dilutions were added, and the plates incubated for 2 hr at room temperature, and then washed with washing buffer containing Tween 20 . Bound Ig was detected using 100 200 µl diluted peroxidase coupled goat anti mouse Ig GAMIg , incubating at 2 hours at room temperature, and then washing 3 times with washing buffer. The detection solution, OPD H₂O₂ was added to each well and incubated for 5 min, and the OD₄₉₂ of each well was measured by a Dynatech ELISA reader. 0D units were correlated with µg protein by standard procedures. For IgG the procedure was identical to that above except that labeled goat anti mouse IgG was used instead of total goat anti mouse Ig. Balb C mice were injected with 200 µg of GK1.5 secreted Mab in Freund s complete adjuvant on each of three consecutive days intraperitoneally. The lymph node cells of three mice were pooled, and the cell surface phenotypes were analyzed by two color FACS analysis, using Lyt1 as a global T cell maker. Lymph node cells staining for L3T4 and Lyt2 make up the entire T cell population in mice, and the amounts of each are expressed as percentages of total T lymphocytes in Figure 3. As shown in Figure 3, upon administration of the antibody, the L3T4 population drops drastically in favor of Lyt2, and recovers almost linearly over a period of 37 days, reaching, at that point, about 50 of its former value. Ability of GK1.5 secreted Mab to produce specific immunosuppression with respect to sperm whale myeoglobin in comparison with a stronger immunogen, keyhole limpit hemacyanin KLH was obtained by the procedure and protocols of Example 1 but measuring IgG against these proteins periodically. The results are shown in Figure 4. Mice injected with anti L3T4 were able to maintain low antibody titers against the weaker antigen sperm whale myeoglobin through the test period of 56 days despite periodic boosts with the antigen. For the stronger antigen, KLH, immunoresponsiveness resumed after the recovery period for the helper lymphocytes as determined in Example 4. Balb C mice were rendered diabetic by intravenous injection of 55 mg kg streptozotocin. Within 1 week after treatment, elevated glucose levels showed that the mice were in fact diabetic. Using comparison groups of five mice each, it was demonstrated that syngenic transplants of islets of Langerhans prepared by disecting the islets from pancreatic tissue of littermates is able to reverse the diabetes so that the survival times of the mice exceed 100 days from the administration of 1800 2000 islets. The islets are isolated by a modification of the technique disclosed by Lermarck, A., et al, Three additional groups of five mice were administered Mab secreted by GK1.5 days 1, 0, 1, and 2 from administration of the islets, wherein a total of 350 µg was administered at 100 µg on the first three days and 50 µg on the last. Groups thus treated and then transplanted with 600 800 islets showed survival times comparable to the syngenic treated group, as did those administered 850 1200 islets. Preliminary data indicate that administration of more than 1500 islets also will result in similar survival times. Lymph node cell suspensions of normal and treated mice were prepared in PBS containing 2 FCS and 0.1 sodium azide and depleted of erythrocytes by gradient centrifugation on Ficoll Hypaque . 5 x 10⁵ cells were incubated in 25 µl of pre titered conjugated antibody for 30 min on ice and washed twice. For two color analysis, green fluorescence was derived from directly FITC conjugated reagents anti L3T4, anti Lyt2 . In a second incubation, Texas Red labeled avidin was added and bound to biotinylated first step antibody anti Lyt1 . As controls for background fluorescence levels, control cell preparations which were either unstained or incubated with an isotype matched irrelevant antibody were analyzed. Flow microfluorometry analysis was performed on a modified FACS II system Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA equipped with logarithmic amplifiers. Data analysis was as described by Hayaka, K. , et al,
