# Expanded cell crash cushion.

## Abstract
Energy absorbing apparatus for securing to a rounded object, in particular apparatus 11 for absorbing energy of an errant vehicle impacting a rounded roadside hazard 13 , such as a pole, comprises an expanded cell type sheet which con sists of an array of side by side tubular cells 19 arranged with their axes perpendicular to the median plane of the sheet. This cellular sheet is designed to be at least partially wrapped around the rounded object 13 , whereby the cell configuration is distorted so that the cross sectional areas of the cells 19 are smaller nearest to the rounded object 13 and larger away from said rounded object. The cells 19 of the sheet may be filled with a deformable, energy absorbing material such as foam plastic, and a plurality of said cellular sheets may be used in a stacked relation, offset from each other so that upon impact the walls of overlying arrays of cells cut into each other. For use with a non rounded hazard, an adaptor including a projecting semi circular portion is interposed between said cellular sheet or sheets and the hazard.
