## Description
The present invention relates to a CRT display unit. More particularly, the present invention relates to a CRT display unit which can be used in both of two modes, that is, a standard mode having 262.5 scanning lines for one field and a horizontal deflecting frequency of 15.754 kHz and a high resolution mode having twice as many scanning lines as those of the standard mode and a horizontal deflecting frequency of approximately 25 kHz, this CRT display unit being utilizable as a display unit for a personal computer, a home video game set and the like. Description of the Prior Art Recently, in order to display a clear picture in an electronic calculator such as a personal computer, improvements have been made to enhance the performance of the graphic function. In fact, there are personal computers which provide an output having a resolution of 320 x 200 dots, 640 x 200 dots or 640 x 400 dots. As a CRT display unit corresponding to such graphic display, a television set for domestic use can be used in the case of 320 x 200 dots or 640 x 200 dots since the number of scanning lines in such cases is less than the 230 scanning lines generally included in an ordinary television set put on the market. On the other hand, in a CRT display unit for display at a high resolution with 640 x 400 dots, the number of scanning lines is increased and consequently, it is necessary in principle to lower the vertical deflecting frequency in this case. However, in practice, the vertical deflecting frequency cannot be much reduced because of the necessity of preventing flicker in the Braun tube. For example, in the case of 200 lines and 60 Hz, the vertical deflecting frequency can only be decreased to approximately 50 to 55 Hz. In consequence, it is necessary to increase the horizontal deflecting frequency, for example, to 24.85 kHz compared with the 15.75 kHz with 200 lines. Such vertical and horizontal deflecting frequencies differ greatly from those of an ordinary television set and, therefore, a high resolution CRT display unit to be used exclusively for display is required. Display units of 400 lines meeting such a requirement, especially those for personal use, are in little demand and the manufacturing cost thereof tends to be high. A video reproducing device is disclosed in Patent Abstracts of Japan, Volume 8, No. 281 E 286 1718 , which is adapted to select between a first mode for reproduction of T.V. signals having a first horizontal scanning frequency and a second mode for reproducing video signals from a personal computer having a second, different, horizontal scanning frequency. The desired mode is selected by switching circuits, but there is no disclosure in this document as to the basis on which the switching decision is made. In a television device disclosed in Patent Abstracts of Japan, Volume 7, No. 272 E214 1417 , selection is made between a standard mode and a second T.V. system mode, each having different horizontal synchronizing signals. The selection is made on the basis of the pulse width between the horizontal synchronizing signals. German Patent DE C 3,331,007 discloses a television receiver operable in two modes having different respective synchronizing pulse frequencies. Mode selection is achieved by a manually operable selection switch or by remote control. US A 3,994,019 Sagishima et al. discloses apparatus for discriminating between video signals from a broadcast television signal and signals from a home use video tape recorder. Discrimination is achieved by counting horizontal synchronizing pulses. In video signals from a home use video tape recorder additional pulses appear due to video head switching noises, resulting in a greater number of apparent horizontal synchronizing pulses being counted with video tape recorder signals than with broadcast television signals. Although this document suggests that a television receiver can be modified in response to the discrimination to accommodate the characteristics of the particular video signal received, it would appear that such a system is not suitable for reproducing signals having modes with differing numbers of lines per frame, since the very discrimination of the invention appears to rely on the same number of genuine horizontal synchronizing pulses in each frame. U.S. Patent US A 4,349,839 McGinn describes a television receiver adapted for reproducing video signals having one of two different numbers of lines in each frame. In the embodiments described, the first format has 525 lines per frame, whereas the second format has 625 lines per frame. A switch 66, see Figure 5 is used to preselect the desired mode, and, in one embodiment, this is constituted by a small strip of deposited metallisation which is present when the switch is to be closed and which is not present, i.e. is not deposited, when the switch is to be opened. Thus, whether this switch is open or closed would appear to be predetermined at the factory. Within either mode, horizontal synchronizing pulses are counted solely for the purpose of generating a vertical synchronizing signal after the appropriate number of horizontal pulses has been detected, and this appropriate number will depend upon which mode is desired. According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a CRT display unit capable of selecting between a standard mode and a high resolution mode, characterised by the provision of According to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided a CRT display unit operable in a standard mode and in a high resolution mode, characterised in that the unit has means for selecting the horizontal oscillation frequency, the horizontal amplitude and the horizontal flyback period for the CRT of the unit to have a first set of values appropriate for the standard mode or to have a second, different set of values appropriate for the high resolution mode, the said means being adapted for making the said selection in dependence on a count of the number of horizontal synchronizing signals per vertical synchronizing signal in a video signal to be displayed by the unit. Thus, the present invention makes it possible to automatically discriminate between the respective modes and to select a horizontal oscillating frequency, a horizontal amplitude and a horizontal flyback period according to the served mode even if there is a considerable difference in the horizontal deflecting frequencies in the respective modes, which are for example, approximately 16 kHz preferably 15.75 kHz and approximately 25 kHz preferably 24.85kHz . In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, in response to sensing by the mode sensing means of the change to the high resolution mode, a time constant of the horizontal oscillating means included in the horizontal deflecting means is selected appropriately. According to the high resolution mode, switching is made to operate a time constant circuit for determining a flyback period, connected on the output side of a horizontal deflecting transistor driven by the horizontal drive means receiving the oscillation output of the horizontal oscillating means. As a result, the flyback period can be shortened. Further, one end of a horizontal deflecting coil connected to the collector of the horizontal deflecting transistor through an S letter correction capacitor is connected to a step down transformer so that a horizontal amplitude according to the high resolution mode is provided. These features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

Fig. 8 is an electric circuit diagram showing a horizontal oscillating circuit and a horizontal deflecting circuit. Fig. 1 is a schematic block diagram showing the total construction of a television set where an embodiment of the present invention is applied. First, referring to Fig. 1, the construction of the television set will be described. An antenna 1 receives a radio wave from a broadcasting station and applies a television signal to an RF and IF amplifier 2. The television signal applied to the RF and IF amplifier 2 is provided to a detecting circuit 3. The output of the detecting circuit 3 is applied to an input selecting circuit 4. The input selecting circuit 4 makes selection between a television signal applied from an external apparatus such as a personal computer 5 and a television signal based on the radio wave applied through the antenna 1. A personal computer signal provided from the personal computer 5, as shown in the following table 1, has a line mode B or C with respect to the television signal A based on the radio wave. The television signal selected by the above stated input selecting circuit 4 is applied to the subsequent first video amplifier 6. The first video amplifier 6 amplifies the television signal to provide the video signal to a second video amplifier 7 and a synchronizing signal separation circuit 10. The second video amplifier 7 amplifies the video signal and applies the amplified signal to a CRT control circuit 8. The CRT control circuit 8 converts the video signal provided from the second video amplifier 7 from the serial signal to a parallel signal so as to enable the respective cathodes G, R and B of the CRT 9. The CRT control circuit 8 is adapted to enable the respective cathodes of the CRT 9 also by the respective signals RGB applied from the above stated personal computer 5. The synchronizing signal separation circuit 10 separates a vertical synchronizing signal F Further, the television set comprises a line mode detecting circuit 17, a switching circuit 18 and an erroneous operation preventing circuit 19. To the line mode detecting circuit 17, the horizontal synchronizing signal F Fig. 2 is a specific block diagram of the line mode detecting circuit shown in Fig. 1 and Figs. 3 and 4 are timing charts for explaining the operation of the line mode detecting circuit. The line mode detecting circuit 17 comprises a counter 179, an AND circuit 180, a detector 181 and an integrator 182, as shown in Fig. 2. The counter 179 counts the number of pulses of the horizontal synchronizing signal F To the output terminal of the AND circuit 180, the integrator 182 is connected through the detector 181. The integrator 182 is characterized by a short charging time and a long discharging time. The charging time is equal to an output period of the AND circuit 180, that is, a pulse period of the vertical synchronizing signal F The switching circuit 18 comprises a semiconductor circuit, for example, a CMOS logic circuit with a threshold level set to approximately 1 2 of the supplied voltage, so that the output thereof falls to a low level in the case of the input thereof higher than a predetermined threshold level and rises to a high level in the case of the input thereof lower than the threshold level. The operation of the line mode detecting circuit 17 thus constructed will be described in the following. When a personal computer signal having 448 lines for one frame as shown in Table 1C for example is applied from the personal computer 5, the counter 179 counts each time a horizontal synchronizing signal F Thus, in a period when the outputs of the counters 175, 177 and 178 in the sixth, eighth and ninth stages respectively are all at the high level, the output of the AND circuit 180 attains the high level so that the integrator 182 is charged. When the counter 179 restarts counting after passage of that period, the output of the AND circuit 180 falls to the low level and all the outputs of the counters 175, 177 and 178 in the sixth, eighth and ninth stages respectively attain again the low level, so that the integrator 182 is discharged till the output of the AND circuit 180 rises to the high level. Since the discharging time constant of the integrator 182 is set to more than 1 2 of the vertical synchronizing cycle T Now, let us assume that the input selecting circuit 4 selects a television signal based on a radio wave instead of the above stated personal computer signal from the personal computer 5. In this case, the output of the counter 178 in the ninth stage is at the low level till the 255th horizontal synchronizing signal F When the mode signal of the integrator 182 is at the high level, the output of the switching circuit 18 is of a low value, so that the horizontal oscillating frequency and the oscillating frequency of the horizontal oscillating circuit 13 associated with the operation of the deflecting circuit are changed to correspond to the personal computer signal shown in Table 1C. Also in the horizontal deflecting circuit 14, the horizontal amplitude and the horizontal flyback period are changed. This changing operation will be described later in detail with reference to Fig. 8. Fig. 5 is a specific block diagram of the erroneous operation preventing circuit shown in Fig. 1 Fig. 6 is a timing chart for explaining the operation of the erroneous operation preventing circuit and Fig. 7 is a detailed electric circuit diagram of the erroneous operation preventing circuit. Referring to Figs. 5 to 7, the erroneous operation preventing circuit will be described. If a video signal containing noise is provided from the first video amplifier 6, a pulse due to the noise could be mixed in the horizontal synchronizing signal F Therefore, the erroneous operation preventing circuit 19 comprises a noise level detecting circuit 191 and an erroneous operation prevention signal providing circuit 194 as shown in Fig. 5. The noise level detecting circuit 191 comprises a noise amplifier 192 and a detector 193. The noise amplifier 192 receives from the second video amplifier 10, a video signal containing noise as shown in Fig. 6 a and amplifies mainly the synchronizing signal by a bias approximate to the class B amplification. The detector 193 comprises, as shown in Fig. 7 for example, a diode detector and the like connected to the output of the noise amplifier 192 through a capacitor C for blocking direct current. The detector 193 receives the output of the noise amplifier 192 as shown in Fig. 6 b and provides detected voltage as shown in Fig. 6 d . More specifically, in such construction as described above, the output voltage of the detector 193 rises in synchronism with the rise of the horizontal synchronizing signal and the receipt of the noise and when this output voltage exceeds the voltage corresponding to the noise level which makes the apparent number of pulses of the horizontal synchronizing signal twice as large as the real number thereof for example, the erroneous operation prevention signal providing circuit 194 is caused to provide an erroneous operation prevention signal as shown in Fig. 6 e . Thus, the erroneous operation preventing circuit 19 makes it possible to completely prevent the erroneous operation, that is, the supply of an erroneous mode signal due to the wrong determination of a line mode caused by counting the apparent number of pulses of the horizontal synchronizing signal larger than the real number thereof in the case where a noise signal contained in a video signal is applied to the counter 179 of the line mode detecting circuit 17. Fig. 8 is an electric circuit diagram showing the horizontal oscillator and the horizontal deflecting circuit. Referring to Fig. 8, a horizontal oscillating frequency selecting circuit 21 for selecting a horizontal oscillating frequency according to each mode is provided in association with the horizontal oscillator 13. The horizontal oscillator 13 is provided with resistors R1 and R2 and a capacitor C1 externally so that an oscillating frequency can be determined by the time constants thereof. More specifically, in the standard mode, the resistor R1 and the capacitor C1 are connected to make oscillation with the horizontal deflecting frequency f₁ and the time constant is 1 R1 C1. In the high resolution mode, the transistor Q₁ is rendered conductive and the resistors R1, R2 and the capacitor C1 are connected externally to oscillate with the horizontal deflecting frequency f₂, the time constant being 1 R1 R2 C1 . The transistor Q₁ is controlled so that it changes rapidly from the non conducting state to the conducting state, that is, from the state of oscillation with the horizontal deflecting frequency f₁ to the state of oscillation with the horizontal deflecting frequency f₂ and changes slowly from the conducting state to the non conducting state. More specifically, in order to change the time constant at the time of conducting and non conducting states of the transistor Q1, the resistors R3, R4, R5, a capacitor C2 and a diode D1 are connected. The transistor Q1 is conductive when the transistor Q2 controlled by the switching control signal from the switching circuit 18 shown in Fig. 1 is conductive. The oscillation output of the horizontal oscillator 13 is applied to a horizontal drive circuit 20. To the output of the horizontal drive circuit 20, a horizontal deflecting transistor Q3 is connected. To the collector of the horizontal deflecting transistor Q3, a horizontal flyback period selecting circuit 22 is connected. More specifically, between the collector and the emitter of the horizontal deflecting transistor Q3, a flywheel diode D2 is connected and capacitors C3 and C4 are connected in series. To the point of connection of the capacitors C3 and C4, a cathode of a bias diode D3 and an anode of a thyristor 24 are connected. To the emitter of the horizontal deflecting output transistor Q3, an anode of the diode D3 and a cathode of the thyristor 24 are connected. The gate of the thyristor 24 is connected to a thyristor drive circuit 25. In response to a gate signal from the thyristor drive circuit 25, the thyristor 24 is conducted in the standard mode to bring the capacitor C4 into a short circuited state. As a result, the capacitance for determining a horizontal flyback period is determined only by the capacity C3. On the other hand, the thyristor 24 is in the non conductive state in the high resolution mode and the horizontal flyback period is made shorter than that in the standard mode as the capacitance for determining the horizontal flyback period is set to C3 C4 C3 C4 . To the collector of the above stated horizontal deflecting output transistor Q3, a flyback transformer 26 is connected and an end of a deflecting coil 28 and an end of a step down transformer 27 are also connected through the S letter correction capacitor C5. The other end of the step down transformer 27 is grounded and an intermediate tap 29 thereof is connected to one contact of a relay 30. The other contact of the relay 30 is grounded and a common contact is connected to the other end of the deflecting coil 28. The relay 30 selects a horizontal amplitude in the standard mode and that in the high resolution mode. An end of a coil 31 of the relay 30 is connected to a DC power source 32 and the other end thereof is connected to the collector of the above stated transistor Q2. Further, a protection circuit 23 is connected to the common contact of the relay 30. The protection circuit 23 comprises diodes D4, D5, resistors R6, R7 and capacitors C6 and C7. The protection circuit 23 is temporarily opened at the time of switching the contact of the relay 30 and an abnormal pulse of high voltage generated at this time in the horizontal deflecting coil 28 is absorbed by the protection circuit 23. The diode D4 and the capacitor C6 included in the protection circuit 23 constitute a rectifier, which rectifies pulse voltage generated at the time of switching the contact of the relay 30 from the ground side to the side of the intermediate tap 29 of the step down transformer 27, so as to apply DC voltage to the thyristor drive circuit 25. Now, referring to Fig. 8, operation for selecting a horizontal oscillating frequency, a horizontal flyback period and a horizontal amplitude at the time of change from the standard mode to the high resolution mode will be described in detail. First, the collector current I From these first and second equations, it can be understood that the flyback pulse voltage V According to the above indicated order of selection, the surge voltage and the stress applied to the horizontal output transistor Q3 are decreased. Accordingly, in an embodiment of the present invention, this order of selection can be established by arranging the horizontal oscillator and the horizontal output circuit as shown in Fig. 8. More specifically, in the standard mode, the horizontal oscillator 13 oscillates with the frequency f₁ determined by the time constants of the external resistor R1 and capacitor C1. When a change is made from the standard mode to the high resolution mode, the transistor Q2 is conducted and as a result, the transistor Q1 is conducted, whereby the resistor R2 is connected in parallel with the resistor R1. In consequence, the horizontal oscillator 13 oscillates with the frequency f₂ corresponding to the high resolution mode. On the other hand, the contact of the relay 30 is turned to the side of the intermediate tap 29 of the step down transformer 27. As a result, in the standard mode, the deflecting coil 28 is set to the horizontal amplitude stepped down by the step down transformer 27. Since the contact of the relay 30 is turned to the side of the intermediate tap 29 of the step down transformer 27, a pulse is provided at the common contact. This pulse is rectified and stabilized by the diode D4 and the capacitor C6 so that a predetermined gate voltage is generated by the thyristor drive circuit 25. The thyristor 4 is conducted by this gate voltage to bring the capacitor C4 into a short circuited state. As a result, only the resonance capacitance of the capacitor C3 is connected between the collector and the emitter of the horizontal output transistor Q3. Accordingly, the horizontal flyback period corresponding to the standard mode is selected. Then, when the high resolution mode is determined, the transistor Q2 is conducted. As a result, the transistor Q1 is also conducted and the horizontal oscillator 13 is connected in parallel with the externally provided resistors R1 and R2. The horizontal oscillator 13 oscillates with the frequency f₂ corresponding to the high resolution mode, with the time constants determined by the resistors R1 and R2 and the capacitor C1. On the other hand, conduction of the transistor Q2 causes electric current to flow in the coil 31 of the relay 30 so that the contact of the relay 30 is turned from the side of the intermediate tap 29 to the ground side. As a result, the deflecting coil 28 is not stepped down by the step down transformer 27 so that the horizontal amplitude corresponds to the high resolution mode. Further, since no pulse is provided at the common contact as a result of switching of the contact of the relay 30, the thyristor 24 is brought into the non conductive state. Then, the resonance capacitance of the capacitors C3 and C4 are caused to be connected between the collector and the emitter of the horizontal output transistor Q3, whereby the horizontal flyback period corresponding to the high resolution mode is selected. When the line mode detecting circuit 17 detects the change from the high resolution mode to the standard mode, the transistor Q2 becomes non conductive. However, since the time constant circuit is provided to make the transistor Q1 change slowly from the conductive state to the non conductive state, the transistor Q1 is not immediately brought into the non conductive state although the transistor Q2 becomes non conductive. As a result of the non conductive state of the transistor Q2, electric current stops flowing in the coil 31 side of the intermediate tap 29 of the step down transformer 27. Consequently, the horizontal amplitude corresponding to the standard mode is selected. The contact of the relay 30 being connected to the side of the intermediate tap 29 causes a pulse at the common contact. The pulse is rectified and stabilized by the diode D4 and the capacitor C6 and the thyristor 24 is rendered conductive by the gate voltage according to the DC voltage. As a result, the capacitor C4 is short circuited and the resonance capacitance is formed only by the capacitor C3, whereby the horizontal flyback period corresponding to the standard mode is selected. After completion of this sequential operation, the transistor Q1 for selecting the oscillating frequency of the horizontal oscillator 13 is rendered non conducting, and the external resistor R2 is separated, so that the horizontal oscillator 13 oscillates with the frequency f₁ corresponding to the standard mode, with the time constants determined by the external resistor R1 and capacitor C1. Thus, a change from the standard mode to the high resolution mode is made according to the order of selection of the horizontal oscillating frequency, the horizontal amplitude and the resonance capacitance, and change from the high resolution mode to the standard mode is made according to the order of selection of the horizontal amplitude, the resonance capacitance and the horizontal oscillating frequency. As a result, the surge voltage and the stress applied to the circuit elements such as the horizontal output transistor Q3 can be decreased and the respective modes can be selected stably without turning off the power source switch.
