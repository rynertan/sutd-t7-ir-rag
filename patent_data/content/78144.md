# SPEED CONTROL APPARATUS

## Abstract
A speed control apparatus comprises a pulse generator 105 for generating a number of pulses proportional to an angle of rotation of a servomotor 104 , a speed signal generator 107P, 107N for converting the frequency of the pulses into a voltage indicative of the actual speed of the servomotor in order to feed back the voltage through negative feedback, a detector 106 for detecting reversal of the direction of rotation of the servomotor, a positional change detector 108P, 108N for detecting a change in a position of the servomotor after the reversal of the direction of rotation of the servomotor by counting the pulses produced by the pulse generator, and a circuit 201P, 201N for lowering the voltage indicative of an actual speed until the position of the servomotor 104 is changed through a given interval.
