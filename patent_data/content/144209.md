# Endoprosthetic bone joint components.

## Abstract
An endoprosthetic bone component is produced from parts 10, 20 respectively having a projection 12 and cavity 21 engageable in a mutual clearance fit, and a third part 30 of plastics material located in the space of such fit, the space and third part being dimensioned to inhibit election of the latter and to lock the two parts against mutual articulation during post operative use. Normally the space and third part will be of generally uniform thickness overall which is small compared to that of the projection. Also the projection and cavity are preferably of uniform cross sectional shape over at least major portions thereof. Typically the two parts will be of different materials, such as ceramic and metal, suited respectively to articulation and bone fixation roles.
