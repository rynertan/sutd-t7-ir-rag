## Description
This invention relates to a marine anti fouling paint generally used as a top coat paint for ships hulls. The growth of marine organisms on the submarine parts of a ship s hull increases the frictional resistance of the hull to passage through water, leading to increased fuel consumption and a reduction in the speed of the ship. Marine growths such as barnacles and algae accumulate so rapidly that the remedy of cleaning and repainting as required is impractical. In general, fouling by marine organisms is limited by applying to the hull a top coat of a paint which releases a biocide for the marine organisms. Traditionally such paints have comprised a relatively inert binder with a biocidal pigment which is leached from the paint. The main binders which have been used are vinyl resins, particularly a vinyl chloride vinyl acetate copolymer, and rosin. The vinyl resins are sea water insoluble and paints based on them use a high pigment concentration so that there is contact between pigment particles to ensure leaching. Rosin is a hard brittle resin which is very slightly soluble in sea water. The biocidal pigment is gradually leached out of the matrix of rosin binder in use, leaving a skeletal matrix of rosin which becomes washed off the hull surface in thin flakes to allow leaching of the biocidal pigment from deeper within the paint film. Examples of rosin anti fouling paints are described at pages 261 and 262 of the book Recommended Practice for the Protection and Painting of Ships published by the British Ship Research Association in 1973. Leaching of the biocidal pigment leaves an irregular layer of binder from which the pigment has been leached so that the roughness of the hull surface gradually increases in use. The most successful paints in recent years have been the Self polishing copolymer paints based on a polymeric binder to which biocidal triorganotin moieties are chemically bound and from which the biocide moieties are gradually hydrolysed by sea water, as described for example in GB A 1,457,590. This generates a water soluble resin which is gradually dissolved from the hull surface by the movement of the ship in service. This gradual dissolution allows the painted hull to at least retain its initial smoothness and even to become smoother in service. Moreover, the gradual dissolution means that a fresh anti fouling paint surface is continuously revealed, prolonging the time for which biocide release at the paint surface is maintained above the lethal concentration. However, there has recently been concern about the environmental effect of triorganotin biocides released from yachts in particular and there is a demand for a marine paint which dissolves smoothly in water without releasing triorganotin moieties or with the release of a smaller amount of triorganotin moieties. A marine anti fouling paint according to the invention comprises a film forming binder which is gradually dissolved in sea water, a marine biocide and a pigment having a solubility in sea water of not more than 10 parts per million by weight, which pigment may itself be the said marine biocide, and is characterised in that the binder is a rosin derivative containing a grouping derived from the reaction of a carboxylic acid group present in rosin or a maleinised or fumarised rosin and a primary or secondary amine group present in an aliphatic polyamine containing at least one primary or secondary amine group. The pigment may itself be the marine biocide of the paint. Rosin is a carboxylic acid functional blend of terpene materials whose major component is abietic acid of the formula C₁₉H₂₉COOH. Rosin containing a high proportion of abietic acid is preferred, for example that sold commercially as WW Rosin. Alternatively, maleinised rosin or fumarised rosin can be used. Maleinised or fumarised rosin has two more carboxylic acid groups per terpene molecule than the rosin from which it is derived. Rosin materials of intermediate acid value can be prepared by partially esterifying maleinised or fumarised rosin with an alcohol, for example to esterify one carboxylic acid group per molecule. The aliphatic polyamine is preferably of the formula H₂N RNH The reaction product of the rosin and polyamine may be mainly an amido amine according to the reaction where Z is a terpene residue, substantially of the empirical formula C₁₉H₂₉, or, when R is ethylene or a 1,2 alkylene group, an imidazoline according to the reaction where R has the formula RNH The reaction between the rosin and polyamine is preferably carried out at 60 150 C. The reaction may be carried out in excess polyamine or in an organic solvent, for example an aromatic hydrocarbon such as xylene or toluene, an aliphatic hydrocarbon such as white spirit, an ester such as butyl acetate or ethoxy ethyl acetate, an alcohol such as butanol or butoxy ethanol or a ketone such as methyl isobutyl ketone or methyl isoamyl ketone. Reaction temperatures of at least 100 C are preferred if it is desired to form imidazoline groups, preferably with removal of water, for example by azeotropic distillation. Production of amido amine is optimised by terminating the reaction after removal of about one mole of water per mole of polyamine introduced. Production of imidazoline is optimised in appropriate cases by continuing the reaction until about two moles of water have been removed per mole of polyamine introduced. The reaction products of the rosin and polyamine are more flexible polymers than rosin and have slightly increased solubility in sea water compared to the rosin from which they are formed. Unlike paints based on resin as binder, which have the disadvantages mentioned above, paints based on them are smoothly dissolved from a ship s hull in service and allow a steady release of the biocide in the paint. The paint binder is mixed with the biocide component of the paint and the pigment or pigments used in the paint. Conventional blending procedures can be used. The pigment is preferably a sparingly soluble pigment having a solubility in sea water of from 0.5 to 10 parts per million by weight, for example cuprous oxide, cuprous thiocyanate, zinc oxide, zinc chromate, zinc ethylene bis dithiocarbamate , zinc dimethyl dithiocarbamate or zinc diethyl dithiocarbamate. These sparingly soluble copper and zinc compounds are generally marine biocides. These sparingly soluble pigments produce water soluble metal compounds on reaction with sea water so that the pigment particles do not survive at the paint surface. Mixtures of sparingly soluble pigments can be used, for example cuprous oxide, cuprous thiocyanate or zinc ethylene bis dithiocarbamate which are the most effective biocidal pigments can be mixed with zinc oxide which dissolves slightly more rapidly in sea water. The paint composition can additionally or alternatively contain a pigment which is not reactive with sea water and may be highly insoluble in sea water solubility below 0.5 ppm by weight such as titanium dioxide or ferric oxide. Such highly insoluble pigments are preferably used in proportions up to 40 per cent by weight of the total pigment component of the paint, most preferably less than 20 per cent by weight. The proportion of pigment to resin binder is preferably such as to give a pigment volume concentration which is above 25 per cent in the dry paint film but below the critical pigment volume concentration most preferably the pigment volume concentration is from 35 50 per cent. The paint composition may contain a plasticiser, for example a poly vinyl methyl ether or a substituted sulphonamide such as N ethyl p toluene sulphonamide. The biocidal effect of the sparingly sea water soluble pigments, particularly cuprous oxide, cuprous thiocyanate and zinc ethylene bis dithiocarbamate may be sufficient so that the paint needs no further biocide. In the case where the paint contains a highly insoluble pigment and no sparingly soluble pigment or for encountering severe fouling the paint contains an added biocide. Triorganotin salts and oxides such as triphenyltin fluoride, tributyltin fluoride, tributyltin dibromosuccinate, triphenyltin chloride, triphenyltin hydroxide and tributyltin oxide are effective marine biocides and can be used in paints according to the invention. A paint according to the invention comprising a triorganotin salt up to 25 per cent by volume of the pigments may have anti fouling and smoothing properties equal to a triorganotin copolymer paint of much higher triorganotin content. In some cases it will be desired to avoid completely the release of triorganotin ions. Examples of other biocides effective as marine anti fouling agents are dithiocarbamate derivatives such as cuprous ethylene bis thiocarbamate or tetramethyl thiuram disulphide, methylene bis thiourea , 4 butyl catechol and captan. The invention is illustrated by the following Examples, in which parts are by weight unless otherwise stated WW grade rosin was reacted with an equimolar amount assuming the rosin to be abietic acid of N hydroxyethyl ethylene diamine in xylene at 100 C with removal of water by azeotropic distillation. Heating was discontinued after 40 minutes when the amount of water removed was approximately equivalent to one mole per mole of diamine, corresponding to the formation of a reaction product comprising mainly amido amine. A portion of the resin solution produced comprising 20.0 parts rosin polyamine reaction product in 13.0 parts xylene was milled with 52.0 parts cuprous oxide, 1.55 parts anti settling agents and 13.45 parts white spirit to produce a marine anti fouling paint having a pigment volume concentration of 35 per cent. WW grade rosin and N hydroxyethyl ethylene diamine were reacted in the same proportions as in Example 1 in xylene at 120 C for an hour. The amount of water removed was nearly 2 moles per mole of diamine corresponding to the formation of a reaction product comprising mainly imidazoline substituted rosin. A marine anti fouling paint was prepared using the formulation of Example 1 but with the imidazoline reaction product of Example 2 in place of the amido amine reaction product of Example 1. The process of Example 1 was repeated using equimolar amounts of pentaethylene hexamine Example 3 or triethylene tetramine Example 4 in place of N hydroxyethyl ethylene diamine to prepare an amido amine reaction product. In each case marine paints were prepared from the reaction product as described in Example 1.
