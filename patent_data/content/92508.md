# Waveguide amplifier circuit.

## Abstract
A waveguide amplifier circuit has two semiconductor amplifier elements 11 in a first waveguide circuit 2 , a second waveguide circuit 3 which is perpendicular to the first waveguide circuit and a termination circuit 4 arranged at an end, remote from the semiconductor amplifier elements, of the second waveguide circuit. An abnormal oscillation component between the two semiconductor amplifier elements is at tenuated by the second waveguide circuit and the termination circuit, thereby obtaining a high power output.
