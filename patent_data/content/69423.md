## Description
This invention is concerned with pharmaceuticaltopical formulations. It is well known that To obtain a stable vehicle for ointments containingwater and creams an emulsifying agent asurfactant is used in their preparation. There areemulsifiers with a lipophilic character to disperse water in oil, i.e. a W O emulsifers or with ahydrophilic character to disperse oil in water,i.e. an O W emulsifiers . In the case of an ointment more oil than water usually a W O emulsifier isused the ointment consists of a continuous oilphase in which small water particles are present.In the case of a cream more water than oil an O Wemulsifier is used the cream consists of acontinuous water phase in which small oil particlesare present. To ascertain whether formulationsare ointments or creams coloured compoundscan be used which dissolve either in theoil phase or the water phase, and by means of amicroscope a distinction can be made. New Zealand patent No. 187103 concerns thespecific problem of preventing the oxidation ofdithranol, when incorporated in the fat phase of astiff emulsion to be used for treating psoriasis.This problem is solved by adding an anti oxidant andan acid to the agueous phase of an o w emulsionwherein dithranol is in the fat phase. The claims ofNew Zealand patent No. 187103 broadly cover o wemulsions containing from 20 to 60 of petroleumjelly and from 5 to 20 of an emulsifier. As mentioned heretofore in the manufacture ofa cream more water than oil an oil in water O W emulsifier is used. It has now been found thatstable compositions in the form of fatty creams ,which contain more fatty compounds than water,can be obtained when an O W non ionic emulsifyingagent or surfactant of hydrophilic characteris used this is new and quite unexpected in thetherapeutic field. The surfactant or emulsifer should preferablyhave a high HLB Hydrophilic Lipophilic Balance number. This term has been defined in the articleby Balsam Thus, the present invention relates to a topicalcomposition in the form of fatty creams forapplication to the body, which comprises a fattybase, water and at least one non ionic surfactant,the composition containing from 60 to 80 by weight of fatty material s , from 1.5 to 5 byweight of surfactant s the surfactant s having aHLB Hydrophilic Lipophilic Balance number of14 or above, and a therapeutic agent with the exception of dithranol and its derivatives. Preferably,the composition contains 60 to 70 by weight offatty material. The fatty creams of the present invention canbe prepared by the application of conventionalmethods for the manufacture of ointments andcreams. Microscopic examination of them showssometimes a picture of a complex emulsion, andsometimes an oil in water emulsion, dependingon the intensity of the mixing procedure. In caseof a complex emulsion the continuous phase is insome parts of the emulsion the oily componentsand in other parts the continuous phase is water.The fatty creams have an occlusive action whenapplied to skin due to the high oil content theskin becomes moist and therefore better penetrableby the therapeutic agent employed therein.Moreover the fatty creams, in contrast with ointments,are non greasy and readily removablefrom the skin or material which come into contactwith them. The fatty materials which are incorporated inthe fatty creams of the present invention arethose commonly used in the preparation of ointmentsand creams. Preferably a mixture of fattycompounds solid, semi solid and or liquid atambient temperature is used in the preparationof the fatty creams. The fatty compounds may be,for example, waxes e.g. white soft paraffin ,liquid paraffin, fatty alcohols and esters e.g. cetylstearyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol and glycerinmonostearate , vegetable oils e.g. cottonseed,coconut. soybean or peanut oil , mineral oils orliquid silicones. Preferably a combination of cetylstearyl alcohol, liquid paraffin and white softparaffin is employed. The amount of hydrophilic non ionic surfactant liquid or solid used in the preparation of thefatty creams of the present invention is preferablyfrom 1.5 to 3.5 advantageously 3 by weightof the final composition. The surfactant is preferablycetomacrogol 1000 i.e. polyethylene glycol 1000 monoceryl ether other surfactants whichmay be used are polysorbate 60 i.e. polyoxyethylene 20 sorbitan monostearate , and polysorbate80 or Tween 80 i.e. polyoxyethylene 20 sorbitanmonooleate . Advantageously only one surfactantis employed. The amount of water preferably de ionised used in the preparation of the fatty creams of thepresent invention may range from 20 up to 35 by weight of the final composition. Advantageouslyabout 30 of water is used. The topically active therapeutic agent s with the exception of dithranol and its derivatives incorporatedin the fatty creams of the present inventionmay be a steroid for example an anti inflammatorysteroid , an antibiotic or achemotherapeutic agent, or a combination ofsuch therapeutically useful agents. The therapeuticagent may be, for example, hydrocortisone 17α butyrate,hydrocortisone, triamcinoloneacetonide, salicylic acid and derivatives thereof, tar products, sulphur compounds, iodine compounds,nicotinic acid and derivatives thereof,hexachlorophene or retinoic acid. The amount oftherapeutic agent, which may be soluble in theaqueous or oil phase of the fatty cream, will bethat suitable for the application intended. When the therapeutic agent e.g. hydrocortisone 17α butyrate is soluble in the aqueous phaseof the fatty cream, a better activity can beobtained than in a normal cream or ointment asthe therapeutic agent is dissolved in a smallervolume of water, leading to a higher concentrationof the therapeutic agent. It may be useful to include in the fatty reams ofthe present invention a buffering agent to maintaina desired pH value. The buffering agent maybe, for example, a combination of i citric acidand sodium citrate, ii phosphoric acid andsodium phosphate, or iii lactic acid and sodiumlactate, as appropriate for the desired pH. Wherethe therapeutic agent is hydrocortisone 17α butyratea slightly acidic environment e.g. pH 3.5 to4.5 is needed in order to prevent hydrolysis of thebutyrate a combination of citric acid and sodiumcitrate is particularly useful for the purpose. The fatty creams of the present invention mayalso incorporate as is common practice in ointmentsand cream a preservative to prevent, forexample, bacterial attack. Suitable preservativesare methyl hydroxybenzoate, chlorocresol, sorbicacid and benzoic acid. As mentioned heretofore, the fatty creams ofthe present invention may be prepared by conventionalmeans. A preferred method involvesmixing the fatty components e.g. cetyl stearylalcohol, liquid paraffin and white soil paraffin with the hydrophilic non ionic surfactant preferablycetomacrogol 1000 and heating the mixtureat, for example, 70 80 C. Separately in a suitableointment mixer water preferably de ionised ,buffering agent and preservative are mixed andheated e.g. at 70 80 C until a solution isobtained. A small portion of the resulting solutionis separated and cooled to ambient temperature,and then the therapeutic agent is added to it. Theliquid fatty composition at elevated temperature e.g. 70 80 C is added to the larger portion ofthe aqueous solution and then, after vigorousstirring under reduced pressure to avoid airbubbles in the final fatty cream , the aqueoussolution or suspension containing the therapeuticagent is added to it at normal pressure. Aftervigorously mixing the mass at about ambienttemperature for an appropriate length oftime once again under reduced pressure afatty cream is obtained. The temperature of the final mixing of thecomponents of the fatty cream and the agitationinvolved can affect the form of the emulsion oil in waterand or water in oil obtained. Preferablyit is effected at 20 25 C with vigorous agitation. The fatty creams of the present invention soobtained preferably comprise oil globules with amean diameter of 1 2 µm maximum 5 µm . As aresult of the high fat content, an aqueous phase is usually hardly perceptible. Possibly the water isattached as a thin film to the surface of theglobules, still forming the continuous phase. The fatty smooth creams of the present inventioncan be extremely stable under normal conditions,especially when they are emulsions containingmostly oil particles of very small meandiameter, e.g. 1 2 µm. The following Examples illustrate the preparationof fatty creams according to the presentinvention. 50 kg of a fatty cream was prepared asfollows The procedure of Example 1 to obtain a fatty creamwas followed but replacing the 50 g ofhydrocortisone 17α butyrate by 500 g of hydrocortisoneand using 15050 g of de ionised waterinstead of 15500 g. The procedure of Example 1 to obtain a fatty creamwas followed but replacing the 50 g ofhydrocortisone 17α butyrate by 50 g of triamcinoloneacetonide. The procedure of Example 1 was followedexcept that the hydrocortisone 17α butyrate viz.the therapeutic agent was omitted consequentlythe step of separation of 2000 g of the preparedaqueous solution was not effected. A fatty cream base, which can be used as apharmaceutical or therapeutical aid, was obtained. The procedures of Examples 1 to 4 werefollowed but replacing the cetyl stearyl alcohol byglyceryl monostearate. The procedures of Examples 1 to 4 werefollowed but replacing the cetomacrogol 1000 bypolysorbate 80. The procedures of Examples 1 to 4 werefollowed but replacing the liquid paraffin by avegetable oil selected from cottonseed, refinedcoconut and soybean oils. The procedures of Examples 1 to 4 werefollowed but replacing part or all the white softparaffin by a corresponding amount of hardenedpeanut oil. The procedures of Examples 1 to 4 werefollowed but replacing the citric acid and sodiumcitrate by other buffering systems, viz. phosphoricacid and sodium phosphate, modification of theratio of both giving the desired pH. The procedures of Examples 1 to 4 werefollowed except that no buffering agent viz. citricacid and sodium citrate was added. The procedures of Examples 1 to 4 werefollowed with the methyl hydroxybenzoatereplaced by another preservative selected fromchlorocresol, sorbic acid and benzoic acid. All the products of Examples 5 to 32 were fatty creamssimilar to that obtained in Example 1.
