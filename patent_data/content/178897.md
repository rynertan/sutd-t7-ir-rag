## Description
The present invention relates to a display apparatus used for a display terminal of general computer systems, microcomputer systems, and the like, and more particularly to a raster scan type display apparatus for displaying graphics and characters. Recently, with the spread of computers and microcomputers, raster scan type display apparatuses using a cathode ray tube CRT or the like have become widely used for their display terminals. In the raster scan type display apparatus using a CRT or the like, a picture is displayed on the screen from the upper left hand corner of the display screen by sequentially accessing display memory addresses. Conventionally, the display apparatus using an ordinary raster scan type CRT comprises a timing generator, a display memory address generator, a display memory, a shift register, and a display monitor. The timing generator generates a horizontal clock, a horizontal synchronizing clock, and a vertical synchronizing clock. The display memory address generator generates a display memory address from the horizontal clock, horizontal synchronizing clock, and vertical synchronizing clock. Display data are read out from the display memory with the display memory address applied thereto and are converted from parallel form into serial form by a shift register to be outputted to the display monitor. The display memory address generator is composed of a horizontal counter which is reset by the horizontal synchronizing clock and counts the horizontal clock, and a vertical counter which presets a display start address stored in a vertical preset address register by the vertical synchronizing clock, and counts the horizontal synchronizing clock, and outputs the values of the horizontal counter and vertical counter as the display memory address to the display memory. Operation of the above described conventional apparatus will be explained in the following. First, at a display start position the upper left corner on the display screen the horizontal counter is reset by the horizontal synchronizing clock, and the horizontal counter is preset with the display start address stored in the vertical preset register by the horizontal synchronizing clock. The horizontal counter counts up to a predetermined memory width during a horizontal scanning period. When the count value of the horizontal counter becomes a predetermined value corresponding to the predetermined memory width in one horizontal scanning period, the horizontal counter is again reset by the horizontal synchronizing clock and the vertical counter is counted up by one by the horizontal synchronizing clock. This process is sequentially repeated until the display position reaches a display end position the lower right corner on the display screen . When the display position has reached the display end position, the vertical counter is preset with the display start address stored in the vertical preset register by the vertical synchronizing clock, and the above scanning process is restarted. In the above described arrangement, it will be possible only to vertically scroll the displayed picture by sequentially changing the value stored in the vertical preset register. However, the conventional, display apparatus cannot offer more complex display functions such as the panning display which freely displays any portions of a larger display memory, the split screen display, the function that each of the split screens is freely arranged for graphic display and character display, and the window display. An object of the present invention is to provide a raster scan type CRT display apparatus which has functions of horizontally split screen display, vertically split screen display, or both horizontally and vertically split, or latticed, screen display. Another object of the invention is to provide a raster scan type CRT display apparatus which has a function of panning display of the split screen. A further object of the invention is to provide a raster scan type CRT display apparatus which has a function of displaying either of graphics and characters freely on any of the split screens.

The above and other objects, features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following description taken in connection with the accompanying drawings in which Preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described in the following with reference to the accompanying drawings. Fig. 1 is a block diagram of a display apparatus of a first embodiment of the invention. Referring to Fig. 1, 11 denotes a timing generator, 12 denotes a horizontal address counter, 13 denotes a vertical line counter, 14 denotes a vertical address generator, 15 denotes a block address generator, 16 denotes a code converter, 17 denotes a memory start address generator, 18 denotes a display memory address generator, 19 denotes a display memory, 20 denotes a shift register, and 21 denotes a display monitor. The timing generator 11 generates a horizontal clock, horizontal synchronizing clock, and a vertical synchronizing clock. The horizontal address counter 12, as shown in Fig. 2, is reset by the horizontal synchronizing clock, counts the horizontal clock, and outputs a horizontal address X7 X0 22 indicating a display position in the horizontal direction to the block address generator 15 and the display memory address generator 18. The vertical line counter 13, as shown in Fig. 2, is reset by the vertical synchronizing clock, counts the horizontal synchronizing clock, and outputs a vertical line count value Y7 Y0 23 indicating a display position in the vertical direction to the block address generator 15. The vertical address generator 14, as shown in Fig. 3, consists of a display memory horizontal address width register 24, a vertical address adder 25, and a vertical address register 26. The vertical address adder 25 adds the value of the horizontal address width register 24 in which a horizontal address width HW15 HW0 is previously established and the value of the vertical address register 26. The vertical address register 26, which is a register to be reset by the vertical synchronizing clock and to hold the value of the vertical address adder 25 in synchronization with the horizontal synchronizing clock, supplies a vertical address YA15 YA0 27, i.e., the output of the vertical address register 26, to the display memory address generator 18. The block generator 15, as shown in Fig. 4, consists of a horizontal split data memory 28, a horizontal split comparator 29, a horizontal split counter 30, a vertical split data memory 31, a vertical split comparator 32, and a vertical split counter 33. First, the splitting operation of the block address generator 15 in the horizontal direction will be described in the following. In the horizontal split data memory 28, there are established a first horizontal split coordinate value at address 0, a second horizontal split coordinate value at address 1, and succeeding horizontal split coodinate values at succeeding addresses in the like manner. Each horizontal split coordinate value is read out from the horizontal split data memory 28 when a horizontal split position value 34 is applied thereto as the address, and supplied to one input port of the horizontal split comparator 29. The horizontal split comparator 29, which is supplied at the other input port thereof with a horizontal address 22 outputted from the horizontal address counter 12, compares the output of the horizontal split data memory 28 with the horizontal address 22, and when these coincide with each other outputs a coincidence pulse. The horizontal split counter 30 counts up upon receipt of the coincidence pulse. In this arrangement, the horizontal split counter 30 reset by the horizontal synchronizing clock outputs a value 0 as the horizontal split position value 34, and the horizontal split data memory 28 outputs the first horizontal split coordinate value at address 0. The horizontal split comparator 29 compares the horizontal address 22 with the first horizontal split coordinate value, and if these coincide with each other the comparator 29 outputs a coincidence pulse to the horizontal split counter 30. The horizontal split counter 30 counts up and outputs a value 1 as the next horizontal split position value 34. Through repetition of the above described process at a horizontal scanning period, the horizontal split position values 34 are obtained. Next, the splitting operation of the block address generator 15 in the vertical direction will be described. In the vertical split data memory 31, there are established a first vertical split coordinate value at address 0, a second vertical split coordinate value at address 1, and succeeding vertical split coordinate values at succeeding addresses in the like manner. Each vertical split coordinate value is read out from the vertical split data memory 31 when a vertical split position value 35 is applied thereto as the address, and supplied to one input port of the vertical split comparator 32. The vertical split comparator 32, which is supplied at the other input port thereof with a vertical line count value 23 outputted from the vertical line counter 13, compares the output of the vertical split data memory 31 with the vertical line count value 23, and when these coincide with each other outputs a coincidence pulse. The vertical split counter 33 counts up upon receipt of the coincidence pulse. In this arrangement, the vertical split counter 33 reset by the vertical synchronizing clock outputs a value 0 as the vertical split position value 35, and the vertical split data memory 31 outputs the first vertical split coordinate value at address 0. The vertical split comparator 32 compares the vertical line count value 23 with the first vertical split coordinate value, and if these coincide with each other the comparator 32 outputs a coincidence pulse to the vertical split counter 33. The vertical split counter 33 counts up and outputs a value 1 as the next vertical split position value 35. Through repetition of the above described process at a vertical scanning period, the vertical split position values 35 are obtained. The block address generator 15 operating as described above outputs to the code converter 16 a block address YS1, YS0, XS1, XS0 36 consisting of the horizontal split position value 34 as a lower address and the vertical split position value 35 as an upper address. The code converter 16, as shown in Fig. 5, is composed of a block memory 37 which stores predetermined codes and outputs as a converted code 38 one of the predetermined codes which is stored at an address specified by the block address 36 outputted from the block address generator 15. The display memory start address generator 17, as shown in Fig. 5, is composed of a memory start address data memory 39 which stores at least two predetermined memory start address values and outputs as a memory start address MSA19 MSA0 40 one of the predetermined memory start address values which is specified by the converted code 38 outputted from the code converter 16. The memory start address 40 is supplied to the display memory address generator 18. The display memory address generator 18, as shown in Fig. 5, is composed of a relative address adder 41 for adding the horizontal address 22 outputted from the horizontal address counter 12 and the vertical address 27 outputted from the vertical address generator 14 thereby to produce a relative address 42, and an absolute address adder 43 for adding the relative address 42 and memory start address 40 thereby to produce a display memory address DA19 DA0 44 which is outputted to the display memory 19. The display memory 19 receives the display address 44 from the display address generator 18 and outputs a display data DD7 DD0 45 to the shift register 20. The shift register 20 in turn converts the display data 45 into serial data to be displayed on the display monitor 21. The operation of display apparatus as described above will be explained with reference to Fig. 6. Fig. 6 shows an example that the display screen is horizontally split into four and vertically split into four. The display screen is thus divided into 16 blocks, BLOCK 0 BLOCK 15. The horizontal split coordinate values are designated aa, bb and cc, and the vertical split coordinate values are designated dd, ee and ff. First, the splitting operation in the horizontal direction will be explained. The horizontal split counter 30 reset by the horizontal synchronizing clock outputs the horizontal split position value 34 as 0 until the value of the horizontal address 22 reaches the value aa. When the value of the horizontal address 22 reaches the value aa, the coincidence signal outputted from the horizontal split comparator 29 is supplied to the horizontal split counter 30, so that the horizontal split counter 30 counts up and changes the horizontal split position value 34 to 1 . Taking the same steps, the horizontal split position value 34 is kept 1 while the horizontal address value 22 is between aa and bb, 2 while the horizontal address value 22 is between bb and cc, and 3 while the horizontal address value 22 is between cc and the end horizontal address. The above operations are repeated for each horizontal scanning period. Next, the splitting operation in the vertical direction will be explained. The vertical split counter 33 reset by the vertical synchronizing clock outputs the vertical split position value 35 as 0 until the value of the vertical line count value 23 reaches the value dd. When the value of the vertical line count value 23 reaches the value dd, the coincidence signal outputted from the vertical split comparator 32 is supplied to the vertical split counter 33, so that the vertical split counter 33 counts up and changes the vertical split position value 35 to 1 . Taking the same steps, the vertical split position value 35 is kept 1 while the vertical line count value 23 is between dd and ee, 2 while the vertical line count value 23 is between ee and ff, and 3 while the vertical line count value 23 is between ff and the end vertical line count value. The above operations are repeated for each vertical scanning period. At this time, the horizontal split data memory 28 is set up as shown in Fig. 6b and the vertical split data memory 31 is set up as shown in Fig. 6c. Now, the value of the block address 36 is 0 in BLOCK 0 shown in Fig. 6a, 1 in BLOCK 1, and likewise from 2 to 15 in BLOCKs 2 to 15. The block memory 37 may store predetermined converted codes as many as the number of the split blocks 16 in this case . The converted code 38 in the block memory 37, as shown in Fig. 6d for example, is read out by applying thereto the block address 36, and supplied to the memory start address generator 17. The memory start address data memory 39 of the memory start address generator 17, which stores memory start address data as shown in Fig. 6e, outputs the memory start address 40 according to the converted code 38 applied thereto as the address. Here, the range of the values of the converted codes stored in the block memory 37 is determined by the number of the memory start addresses stored in the memory start address data memory 39. In this embodiment, since the number of the memory start addresses stored in the memory start address data memory 39 is four, the range of the values of the converted codes is from 0 to 3. As described above, the memory start address 40 is outputted for each block, the relative address 42 and the display memory address 44 are produced in the display memory address generator 18, and the display memory address 44 is supplied to the display memory 19, whereby the display data 45 in any region in the display memory 19 can be read out for each block on the display screen. According to the embodiment as described above, the horizontal split positions can be freely set by changing the horizontal split coordinate values in the horizontal split data memory 28 for example, aa, bb, and cc in Fig. 6a , and also the vertical split positions can be freely set by changing the vertical split coordinate values in the vertical split data memory 31 for example, dd, ee, and ff in Fig. 6a , so that the display screen can be freely split in a latticed form. Further, the contents of the display on the split blocks on the display screen can be freely selected by establishing the addresses of the memory start address data memory 39 of the memory start address generator 17 at will in the block memory 37 of the code converter 16 as shown in Fig. 6d. Furthermore, by successively updating the values of the memory start address data memory 39 of the memory start address generator 17 with time, the present embodiment enables panning displays on all of those blocks for which the address of the memory start address data memory 39 being in the updating process is established as the value of the block memory 37. Next, a second preferred embodiment of the invention will be described referring to the accompanying drawings. Fig. 7 is a block diagram of a display apparatus of the second embodiment of the invention. Referring to Fig. 7, 11 denotes a timing generator, 12 denotes a horizontal address counter, 13 denotes a vertical line counter, 14 denotes a vertical address generator, 15 denotes a block address generator, 16 denotes a code converter, 19 denotes a display memory, and 21 denotes a display monitor, but descriptions of these parts are omitted here since these parts are already shown in Fig. 1 and descriptions of the same are already made. In Fig. 7, 46 denotes a character vertical address generator, 47 denotes a memory start address generator, 48 denotes a first multiplexer MUX1 , 49 denotes a display memory address generator, 50 denotes a first shift register, 51 denotes a character generator ROM, 52 denotes a second shift register, and 53 denotes a second multiplexer MUX2 . The character vertical address generator 46, as shown in Fig. 8, consists of a character row counter 54, a character horizontal address width register 55, a character vertical address adder 56, and a character vertical address register 57. The character row counter 54, which is a counter counting a horizontal synchronizing clock for generating a character row address RA2 RA0 59, outputs a character pulse 58 and simultaneously resets itself each time when counted up the number of rows of a character. In this case, the number of rows is eight. The count output of the character row counter 54 is supplied as the character row address 59 to the character generator ROM 51. The character address adder 56 adds the value of the character horizontal address width register 55 in which a predetermined character horizontal address width is set with the value of the character vertical address register 57. The character vertical address register 57, which is a register reset by a vertical synchronizing clock and holds the value of the character vertical address adder 56 each time the character pulse 58 is inputted thereto, supplies its output, i.e., a character vertical address YCA15 YCA0 60, to the first multiplexer MUX1 48. The memory start address generator 47, composed of a data memory which stores at least two predetermined sets of memory start address values and character graphic display switching codes, reads out a memory start address 40 and a character graphic display switching code 61 stored in the data memory when the converted code 38 outputted from the code converter 16 is applied thereto as the address. The memory start address 40 is supplied to the display memory address generator 49 and the character graphic display switching code 61 is supplied to both the first multiplexer MUX1 48 and the second multiplexer MUX2 53. The first multiplexer MUX1 48 selects either the vertical address 27 from the vertical address generator 14 or the character vertical address 60 from the character address generator 46 according to the character graphic display switching code 61, and supplies the selected one as a character graph vertical address 62 to the display memory address generator 49. The display memory address generator 49 is the same in operation as the display memory address generator 18 in the earlier described first embodiment except that this generator 49 receives the character graph vertical address 62 instead of the vertical address 27 in the earlier case. The generator 49 outputs the display memory address 44 to the display memory 19. The first shift register 50, which is the same in operation as the shift register 20 in the earlier described first embodiment, converts the display data 45, i.e., the output of the display memory 19, into serial data to be supplied to the second multiplexer MUX2 53. The character generator ROM 51, which is a ROM storing character font data, outputs character font data 63 read therefrom when the character row address 59 is applied thereto as the character row address and the display data 45 is applied thereto as the character address. The character font data 63 is supplied to the second shift register 52. The second shift register 52 converts the character font data 63 from the character generator ROM 51 into serial data to be supplied to the second multiplexer MUX2 53. The second multiplexer MUX2 53 selects either the output of the first shift register 50 or the output of the second shift register 52 according to the character graphic display switching code 61, and supplies the selected one to the display monitor 21. Operation of the display apparatus arranged as above will be described in the following. The converted code 38 generated by the code converter 16 in the same manner as in the first embodiment is a signal provided for each of the horizontally and vertically split blocks and supplied to the memory start address generator 47. The memory start address generator 47 reads therefrom, with the converted code 38 applied thereto as the address, the memory start address 40 and the character graphic display switching code 61 at the same time. The character graphic display switching code 61 is used as a signal to specify which of a graphic display and a character display should be made on the specified block on the display screen, and, in the same way as the memory start address 40, can be set for each block by means of the converted code 38. Here, for example, the character graphic display switching code 61 is assumed to be 0 for a graphic display and 1 for an alphanumeric character display. If the character graphic display switching code 61 is 0 , the first multiplexer MUX1 48, receiving the vertical address 27 and the character vertical address 60, selects the vertical address 27 and outputs the same as the character graph vertical address 62 to the display memory address generator 49, and the second multiplexer MUX2 53, receiving the output of the first shift register 50 and the output of the second shift register 52, selects the output of the first shift register 50 and outputs the same to the display monitor 21, so that a graphic display is made. If the character graphic display switching code 61 is 1 , the first multiplexer MUX1 48, receiving the vertical address 27 and the character vertical address 60, selects the character vertical address 60 and outputs the same as the character graph vertical address 62 to the display memory address generator 49, and the second multiplexer MUX2 53, receiving the output of the first shift register 50 and the output of the second shift register 52, selects the output of the second shift register 52 and outputs the same to the display monitor 21, so that a character display is made. According to the second embodiment as described above, additional function to those described with reference to the first embodiment can be performed. That is, by establishing at least two sets of memory start address values and character graphic display switching code values in the memory start address generator 47, reading out the converted code for each of the split blocks, and obtaining the memory start address as well as the character graphic display switching code from the converted code, either of the graphic display and the character display can be performed at will on each of the split blocks. The number of horizontal and vertical splits on the display screen, the size of the block memory, and the size of the memory start address data memory, used in the above description of the first and second embodiment are merely examples, and the present invention is not limited with regard to such number and size.
