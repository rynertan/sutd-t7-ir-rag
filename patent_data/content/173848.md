The present invention relates to a method for the treatment and or prophylaxis of disorders of the cardiovascular system. European Patent Publication No.s 76075, 91748, 93535, 95316, 107423, 120426, 120427, 126311, 126350, 126367 and 138134 describe classes of chromanols, chromenes and chromans having anti hypertensive activity. It has now been discovered that compounds of this type have a mechanism of action which indicates that they are of potential use in the treatment of other cardiovascular disorders. Such disorders include congestive heart failure, angina, peripheral vascular disease and cerebral vascular disease, hereinafter referred to as CVS disorders. Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for the treatment and or prophylaxis of CVS disorders in mammals, such as humans, which method comprises administering to the mammal in need of such treatment and or prophylaxis an effective and or prophylactic amount of a compound of formula I wherein When one of R₁ and R₂ is hydrogen, the other is,preferably, selected from the class of C₁ ₆ alkylcarbonyl, C₁ ₆ alkoxycarbonyl, nitro or cyano. In particular, when one of R₁ and R₂ is hydrogen, the other is,preferably, acetyl, nitro or cyano, especially nitro or cyano. When one of R₁ and R₂ is hydrogen, it is preferred that R₂ is hydrogen. When one of R₁ and R₂ is nitro, cyano or C₁ ₃ alkylcarbonyl the other is, preferably, amino optionally substituted by one or two C₁ ₆ alkyl or by C₂ ₇ alkanoyl. In particular, when one of R₁ and R₂ is nitro, cyano or C₁ ₃ alkylcarbonyl, the other is amino, methylamino, dimethylamino or acetylamino.

When R₅ is C₁ ₆ alkoxy and R₆ is hydrogen, preferred examples of R₅ include methoxy and ethoxy, of which methoxy is more preferred. When R₅ is C₁ ₇ acyloxy and R₆ is hydrogen, a preferred class of R₅ is unsubstituted carboxylic acyloxy, such as unsubstituted aliphatic acyloxy or benzoyloxy. However, it is preferred that R₅ and R₆ together are a bond, or R₅ and R₆ are both hydrogen, or, in particular, that R₅ is hydroxy and R₆ is hydrogen. Suitable values for R₈, when R₇ and R₈ are not joined together include hydrogen, methyl, ethyl, Suitable values for R₇ then include hydrogen, methyl, ethyl, Examples of R₇ aryl include phenyl and naphthyl of which phenyl is preferred. A sub class of R₇ heteroaryl is 5 or 6 membered monocyclic or 9 or 10 membered bicyclic heteroaryl of which 5 or 6 membered monocyclic heteroaryl is preferred. In addition, 5 or 6 membered monocyclic or 9 or 10 membered bicyclic heteroaryl preferably contains one, two or three heteroatoms which are selected from the class of oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur and which, in the case of there being more than one heteroatom, are the same or different.

There is a favourable group of compounds within formula I of formula II wherein p is 1 or 2 and the remaining variables are as defined in formula I . Examples of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a compound of formula I include the acid addition salts of a compound of formula I , wherein one or other of R₁ and R₂ is amino or an amino containing group, for example the hydrochloride and hydrobromide salts. Examples of a pharmaceutically acceptable solvate of a compound of formula I include the hydrate. Preferably, a compound of formula I is in substantially pure form. Examples of the compounds of formula I include the examples described in the aforementioned European Patent Publications. The compounds of formula I , wherein R₅ is hydrogen, hydroxy, C₁ ₆ alkoxy or C₁ ₇ acyloxy and R₆ is hydrogen, are asymmetric and, therefore, can exist in the form of optical isomers. The present invention extends to all such isomers individually and as mixtures, such as racemic modifications. The compounds of formula I may be prepared as described in the aforementioned European Publications, in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,446,113, 4,481,214, 4,496,565 and 4,510,152 or by analogous methods thereto. The administration of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may be by way of oral, sublingual, transdermal or parenteral administration. An amount effective to treat the disorders hereinbefore described depends on the usual factors such as the nature and severity of the disorders being treated and the weight of the mammal. However, a unit dose will normally contain 0.1 to 50 mg for example 0.5 to 10 mg, of the compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Unit doses will normally be administered once, or more than once a day, for example 2, 3 or 4 times a day, more usually 1 to 3 times a day, such that the total daily dose is normally in the range, for a 70 kg adult of 0.1 to 50 mg, for example 50 to 10 mg,that is in the range of approximately 0.001 to 1 mg kg day, more usually 0.005 to 0.2mg kg day. No adverse toxicological effects are indicated at the aforementioned dosage ranges. It is greatly preferred that the compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is administered in the form of a unit dose composition, such as a unit dose oral or parenteral composition. Such compositions are prepared by admixture and are suitably adapted for oral or parenteral administration, and as such may be in the form of tablets, capsules, oral liquid preparations, powders, granules, lozenges, reconstitutable powders, injectable and infusable solutions or suspensions or suppositories. Orally administrable compositions are preferred, in particular shaped oral compositions, since they are more convenient for general use. Tablets and capsules for oral administration are usually presented in a unit dose, and contain conventional excipients such as binding agents, fillers, diluents, tabletting agents, lubricants, disintegrants, colourants, flavourings, and wetting agents. The tablets may be coated according to well known methods in the art. Suitable fillers for use include cellulose, mannitol, lactose and other similar agents. Suitable disintegrants include starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone and starch derivatives such as sodium starch glycollate. Suitable lubricants include, for example, magnesium stearate. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable wetting agents include sodium lauryl sulphate. These solid oral compositions may be prepared by conventional methods of blending, filling or tabletting. Repeated blending operations may be used to distribute the active agent throughout those compositions employing large quantities of fillers. Such operations are, of course, conventional in the art. Oral liquid preparations may be in the form of, for example, aqueous or oily suspensions, solutions, emulsions, syrups, or elixirs, or may be presented as a dry product for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may contain conventional additives such as suspending agents, for example sorbitol, syrup, methyl cellulose, gelatin, hydroxyethylcellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, aluminium stearate gel or hydrogenated edible fats, emulsifying agents, for example lecithin, sorbitan monooleate, or acacia non aqueous vehicles which may include edible oils , for example, almond oil, fractionated coconut oil, oily esters such as esters of glycerine, propylene glycol, or ethyl alcohol preservatives, for example methyl or propyl Oral formulations also include conventional sustained release formulations, such as tablets or granules having an enteric coating. For parenteral administration, fluid unit dose forms are prepared containing a compound of the present invention and a sterile vehicle. The compound, depending on the vehicle and the concentration, can be either suspended or dissolved. Parenteral solutions are normally prepared by dissolving the compound in a vehicle and filter sterilising before filling into a suitable vial or ampoule and sealing. Advantageously, adjuvants such as a local anaesthetic, preservatives and buffering agents are also dissolved in the vehicle. To enhance the stability, the composition can be frozen after filling into the vial and the water removed under vacuum. Parenteral suspensions are prepared in substantially the same manner except that the compound is suspended in the vehicle instead of being dissolved and sterilised by exposure to ethylene oxide before suspending in the sterile vehicle. Advantageously, a surfactant or wetting agent is included in the composition to facilitate uniform distribution of the compound of the invention. In addition such compositions may contain further active agents such as anti hypertensive agents and diuretics. As is common practice, the compositions will usually be accompanied by written or printed directions for use in the medical treatment concerned. The present invention also provides the use of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment and or prophylaxis of CVS disorders.Such treatment and or prophylaxis may be carried out as hereinbefore described. The present invention further provides a pharmaceutical composition for use in the treatment and or prophylaxis of CVS disorders which comprises a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Such compositions may be prepared in the manner as hereinbefore described. The following pharmacological data illustrate the activity of compounds of formula I in tests which are indicative of compounds of potential use in the treatment of CVS disorders. N.B. Compound 1 is 6 cyano 3,4 dihydro 2,2 dimethyl Thus, compound 1 antagonises the contractions due to a partially, but not a fully, depolarising concentration of potassium. The effect of compound 1 on contractions mediated by a low concentration of KCl is consistent with the compound hyperpolarising the membrane potential and thereby rendering the potential operated calcium channels less able to open in response to a depolarising stimulus by this mechanism calcium influx is reduced. The effectiveness of compound 1 against a high concentration of KCl indicates that the marked depolarisation due to KCl overcomes the hyperpolarising action of compound 1. Compounds of the examples described in the aforementioned European Publications and U.S. Patents may also be tested and found to be active in tests 1 and 2. At approximately a hypotensive dose, compounds 1 and 2 cause a large increase in oxygen tension PO₂ in hypoxic skeletal muscle in the rat. Measurement of local tissue PO₂ is an objective assessment of the extent to which the tissue is supplied with oxygen and this parameter is low in patients with intermittent claudication. Thus the ability of compounds 1 and 2 to improve tissue oxygen supply indicates a use of compounds 1 and 2 in the treatment of occlusive peripheral vascular disease in man.
