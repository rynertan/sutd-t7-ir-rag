# Electron emission regulator for an X ray tube filament.

## Abstract
An x ray tube mA regulator having an SCR phase shift voltage regulator 36, 37 supplying the primary winding 16 of a transformer 15 whose secondary 14 is coupled to the x ray tube filament 12 . Prior to initiation of an x ray exposure, the filament is preheated to a temperature corres ponding substantially to the electron emissivity needed for obtaining the desired tube mA during an exposure. During the pre exposure interval, the phase shift regulator is controlled by a signal corresponding to the sum of signals representative of the voltage applied to the filament transfor mer, the desired filament current and the space charge compensation needed for the selected x ray tube anode to cathode voltage. When an exposure is initiated, control of the voltage regulator is switched to a circuit that responds to the tube current by controlling the amount of phase shift and, hence, the voltage supplied to the filament transformer 15 . High voltage transformer 18 leakage current com pensation 150 is provided during the exposure interval with acircuit that includes an element 153 whose impedance is varied in accordance with the anode to cathode voltage setting so the element drains off tube current as required to cancel the effect of leakage current variations.
