## Description
PROCESSING ELASTOMERS This invention relates to elastomer gum compositions and their preparation, processing, and use.In another aspect, it relates to fluoroelastomer gumstocks, e.g., compounded copolymers of vinylidene fluoride and hexafluoropropylene, containing a processing aid, and to their preparation and processing. In a still further aspect, it relates to cyanuric acid and their derivatives, and the use of such substances in the processing of vulcanizable elastomer compositions. In order to convert elastomer gums or compounded gumstocks thereof to finished elastomer goods or articles with desired properties, it is common to incorporate into or mix with such elastomer gums various chemical and compounding ingredients, each having a specific function such as in the processing and vulcanization of such elastomer gums or in the end use thereof. One type of such ingredients is processing aids, which are commonly used to modify the viscosity and toughness of the raw or unvulcanized elastomer gum, or to aid it in a specific manner, during or in the processing thereof, erg., mixing, milling, mastication, shaping, or vulcanization of the gum or gumstock. Such aids, as well as other chemical or compounding ingredients, are usually incorporated into the gum with a mill or an internal mixer such as a Banbury mixer .The compounded elastomer gumstock can then be fabricated by molding, calendering, or extrusion into the desired shaped article, which is then subjected to vulcanization curing , transforming the relatively soft, weak, elastomer gum into a finished article made of non tacky, strong, insoluble, chemically and thermally resistant elastomer. Various materials have .hereo fore been prepared and used as processing aids, such as various waxes and oils. For example, in the processing of fluoroelastomers, e.g., copolymers of vinylidene flubride and hexafluoro propylene, which are particularly difficult to process, mixtures of oleic acid and low molecular weight polyethylene have been proposed see U.S. Pat. No.4,328,140, Singletary, et al as have carnauba wax and montan wax see U.S. Pat. No. 3,753,937, Stivers and diorgano sulfur oxide compounds see U.S. Patent No.4,287,320, Kolb . Although conventional processing aids provide many useful benefits in the processing of elastomer gums, as mentioned above, some do not perform as well as desired, some of these interfere with the curing of the gum, and others adversely affect the final physical properties, shape, and visual appearance of the cured elastomer or finished goods. Briefly, this invention in one aspect involves mixing or incorporating cyanuric acid or its isocyanurate or cyanurate derivatives with or into elastomer gums. The resulting mixtures or gumstocks can then be processed, e.g., shaped and vulcanized, in an enhanced manner. For example, the mixtures of elastomer gums and cyanuric acid or preferably isocyanurates or cyanurates have improved extrudability as manifested by the improved appearance and shape of extrusions thereof , molded articles thereof are readily released from their molds without distortion or damage and without requiring treatment of the mold with a release agent, and such mixtures are more easily milled with other compounding and chemical adjuvants, the cyanuric acid and its derivatives as processing aids, and amounts thereof used, being compatible with the gums and having no adverse affect on the crosslinking of the gums or on other desired properties of the gumstocks or finished goods made therefrom. Cyanuric acid is commonly used to collectively refer to two equilibrated tautomer species, i.e., the trihydroxy or enol tautomer specifically called cyanuric acid , and the trioxide or keto tautomer specifically called isocyanuric acid , these tautomers and their equilibrium being illustrated as follows.EMI3.1 isocyanuric acid cyanuric acidWhen reference is made generically or collectively to these acids, the term iso cyanuric acid will be used, as is a common practice e.g., see Kirk Othmer, Encyclopedia ofChemical Technology, 3rd Edition, Vol. 7, John Wiley andSons, 1979, page 397 . In the mono , di , and trisubstituted derivatives of these acids, the substituents bonded to the ring atoms can vary widely,.but in the derivatives used in this invention to process peroxidecurable elastomers, such as fluoroelastomers, those substituents are preferably free of ethylenic, e.g.allylic, unsaturation or at least no more than one of the substituents should contain such ethylenic unsaturation, lest such unsaturated derivatives affect crosslinking of the elastomers or function as crosslinking agents. Preferred classes of the iso cyanuric acid derivatives useful in the practice of this invention can be expressed in terms of the following formula EMI3.2 where R1 is an aliphatic radical or aryl radical, or combinations thereof, such as aralkyl, and n is 0, 1, or 2 and EMI4.1 where Z is 0, S or NR where R is H or lower alkyl, e.g., C1 to C4 , R2 is as detined above for R1, X is halogen, OH, O M l z where M is a metal ion, e.g., Na , Ca , Mg , Al , and z is the valence thereof , or NHR where R is H or lower alkyl, e.g., C1 to C4 , n is 0, 1, or 2.Where R1 and R2 are aliphatic groups, they are preferably free of ethylenic unsaturation, for reasons given above, and where they are alkyl radicals they can have 1 to 24 carbon atoms and although they are preferably unsubstituted linear, branched, or cyclic, they can contain hetero atoms such as 0, S, and N, and halogen substituents such as chlorine or fluorine. Where R1 or R2 is an aryl or aralkyl radical, it is preferably unsubstituted but may contain such hetero or halogen atoms as well. R1 or R2 can also contain one or more isocyanurate or cyanurate rings.Due to the nature of their preparation, the above described iso cyanuric acid derivatives will actually be used in the form of mixtures thereof, the subscript n thus representing an average value for such mixture of compounds, e.g., a mixture of equimolar amounts of C3N303 R 3, C3N303 R 2H and C3N303 R H2 Isocyanurates and cyanurates are known chemical compounds and are conveniently prepared, for example, from cyanuric chloride and cyanuric acid, respectively, and the appropriate organic reagents, e.g., see Burakevich inKirk Othmer, Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 3rdEdition, Vol. 7, Wiley Interscience, New York, 1979, pages 397 410, and U.S. Patent No. 3,075, 79 Tazuma, et al .

Tautomeric forms of partially substituted isocyanurate and cyanurate compounds may be present, e.g.,EMI6.1 These tautomeric forms, and isocyanurates and cyanurates having mixed substituents, are also useful as processing aids in this invention.

The elastomer gums which can be compounded with the processing aids in accordance with this invention will generally be those rubbers or elastomer gums which are of the general and special purpose types. Such gums include those of natural rubber and such synthetic, ethylenically unsaturated rubbers as poly ethylene co propyleneco diene , polychloroprene, polyisoprene, polybutadiene, poly butadiene co styrene , poly butadiene co acrylonitrile , and poly isobutylene co isoprene . The processing aids of this invention will find particular value in improving the processability of vulcanizable fluoroelastomer polymers. Such polymers are described, for example, in the aforementioned prior art, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,159,609 Harris et al , 3,467,635 Brasen et al , 4,214,060 Apotheker , 4,233,421 Worm , and 4,263,414 West . Many of these are commercially available, sold under trademarks such as Fluorel and Vito , and are copolymers of vinylidene fluoride and one or more other co monomers.Among the fluoroelastomer polymers which may be processed in accordance with this invention are the elastomeric copolymers of two or more of the following fluoromonomers vinylidene fluoride, hexafluoropropene, chlorotrifluoroethylene, 2 chloropentafluoropropene, fluorinated methyl vinyl ether, tetrafluoroethylene, l hydropentafluoropropene, dichlorodifluoroethylene, trifluoroethylene, l,l chlorofluoroethylene, and mixtures thereof, and optionally in addition such cure site monomers as 3 iodoperfluoropropene, 4 iodoperfluoropentene, bromotrifluoroethylene, bromodifluoroethylene, and bromotetrafluorobutene, and mixtures thereof. Said fluoromonomers may also be copolymerized with other compounds such as non fluorinated monomers, e.g., ethylene or propylene.The preferred elastomers are copolymers of vinylidene fluoride with at least one terminally ethylenically unsaturated fluoromonomer containing at least one fluorine atom substituent on each double bonded carbon atom, each carbon atom of said fluoromonomer being substituted only with fluorine and optionally with chlorine, hydrogen, lower fluoroalkyl radical, or lower fluoroalkoxy radical, particularly hexafluoropropene, tetrafluoroethylene, chlorotrifluoroethylene, and l hydropentafluoropropene. Particularly preferred are the fluorinated elastomers produced by copolymerizing vinylidene fluoride with hexafluoropropene as described inU.S. Pat. Nos. 3,051,677 and 3,318,854, and those copolymers produced by copolymerizing vinylidene fluoride, hexafluoropropene, and tetrafluoroethylene as described inU.S. Pat. No. 2,968,649. The elastomeric copolymers of hexafluoropropene and vinylidene fluoride have between about 15 and about 50 mole percent hexafluoropropene, optionally with the addition of up to 30 mole percent tetrafluoroethylene, are illustrative of this preferred class. Mixtures or blends of elastomers, e.g., of different viscosities, are also suitable. Table 3 sets forth the approximate compositions of some commercially available vulcanizable fluoroelastomers which are particularly useful in the practice of this invention. TABLE 3 Fluoroelastomer Gums comPosition of gum, mole Code CH2 CF2 C3zE C2F4 CFCl CF A 78 22 B 60 20 20 C 78 22 D 51 23 26 E 50 21 29 F 69 31 These gums also contain a very small amount of a bromine containing fluorinated monomer, the amount being such as to provide about 0.2 to 0.7 wt bromine in the gum as a cure site for subsequent crosslinking with peroxide see U.S. Pat. No. 4,035,565, Apotheker et al, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,263,414, West . In addition to the above described processing aids, there can also be incorporated into the elastomer gum those chemical and compounding ingredients or adjuvants customarlly known to be useful or necessary in processing, fabricating, stabilizing, and vulcanizing such gums, for example, in the case of natural rubber and the aforementioned non fluorinated elastomers, sulfur, peroxide, magnesium oxide, or zinc oxide may normally be incorporated as vulcanizing agents. In the case of the fluoroelastomer gums, depending upon the particular gum of this class, polyamines, aromatic polyhydroxy compounds, pc roxicor, and triallylisocyanurate may also he incorporated as crosslinking agents.Frequently, co curing agents or accelerators, such as organo onium compounds, will also be included in the compounded fluoroelastomer composition, and, just prior to curing, one can also incorporate in the conventional manner divalent metal oxide and or hydroxide acid acceptors. Other conventional compounding agents, such as carbon black and other reinforcing agents or fillers such as calcium carbonate, clay, and silica, pigments, waxes and other conventional processing aids, softeners, plasticizers, and retarding agents, can be incorporated into the gumstock in the conventional manner. In preparing the compounded gumstocks, the processing aids and the various gum adjuvants are milled and dispersed into the gumstock by employing any of the useful rubber mixing devices, such as internal mixers, roll mixers, or any other convenient mixing device. The temperature of the mixture in the mixing device preferably should not be allowed to rise above about 1200C. The compounded, curable gumstock can be extruded or pressed in a mold, and subsequently heated or baked in an oven. In the case of fluoroelastomers, pressing of the compounded gumstock called press cure will usually be conducted at a temperature between about 950C. and about 2300C., preferably between about 1500C. and about 2050C.for a period of from one minute to about 15 hours, usually from five minutes to 30 minutes. A pressure of between about 700 kPa and about 20,600 kPa, preferably between about 3,400 kPa and about 6,800 kPa, is usually imposed on the compounded gumstock in the mold. The molded fluoroelastomer vulcanizate will then be usually post cured oven cured at a temperature between about 1500C.and about 3l50C., usually at about 2600C. for a period of from about two hours to 50 hours or more depending on the cross sectional thickness of the molded article. For thick sections, the temperature during the post cure will usually be raised gradually from the lower limit of the range of the desired maximum temperature selected. For thinner sections, e.g., less than 5 mm, the section may be put into the oven at the desired maximum temperature. The maximum temperature used is preferably about 2600C. and is held at this value for about 24 hours or more. The elastomer gums or gumstocks containing the processing aids of this invention and, if desired or necessary, the chemical and compounding ingredients customarily mixed with such gums, can be used to manufacture the finished rubber goods or articles for which such gums are known to be useful, such as pump valves, tires, belting, hose or tubing, gaskets, seals, O rinys, bushings, diaphragms, and the like, the processing aids enhancing the economics of such manufacture. The following examples are offered to aid in understanding the present invention and are not to be unduly construed as limiting the scope thereof. In these examples, the parts referred to are parts by weight and phr means parts per hundred parts of rubber or elastomer gum. EXAMPLES Example 1 To a round bottom flask, equipped with a stirrer, condenser, heating mantle, thermometer and addition tube, were added 250 ml dimethyl formamide DMF , 64.5 g 0.50 mole cyanuric acid, and 101 g 1.0 mole triethylamine.The mixture was stirred and heated to 950C. for 1 hr., then 120 g 1.1 mole ethyl bromide was slowly added over a period of 1.5 hrs. while stirring and maintaining the temperature at 80 to 1000 C. The reaction mixture was then heated for an additional hour at 900C. and then the temperature slowly raised to 1300C. and heating continued for 6 hrs. DMF was gradually distilled off under reduced pressure. After adding 300 ml water to the reaction vessel, the resulting mixture was cooled and filtered.

Example 7 Following the procedure of Example 4, 110 g 0.34 mole CH3 0C2H4 6C2H40H ttCARBOWAX 350 , and 31.8 g 0.3 mole of sodium carbonate were stirred at about 400 C. while slowly adding 18.6 g 0.1 mole cyanuric chloride. The resulting reaction mixture was heated slowly to 1400C. and heated at this temperature for 2 hrs. After cooling to room temperature, 100 ml acetone were added, the inorganic salts filtered, the filter cake rinsed with additional acetone, and the combined filtrates concentrated by heating at reduced pressure to yield 113 g of a pale yellow, liquid, cyanurate product No. C 4 of Table 2 . Example 8 Following the procedure of Example 4, 91.6 g 0.2 mole C8F17C2H40H and 21 g 0.2 mole sodium carbonate were stirred at about 450C. while slowly adding 12.4 g 0.067 mole cyanuric chloride. The resulting mixture was stirred and heated at 900C. for 2 hrs., then at 1350C. for 4 hrs.The cooled reaction mixture was mixed well with 100 ml water and 400 ml 1,1,2 trichlorotrifluoroethane and the organic phase separated and concentrated at reduced pressure to yield 84 g of cyanurate product No. C S ofTable 2 . Example 9 Following the procedure of Example 4, 75.6 g 0.13 mole CgF17SO2N C2H5 C2H4O 3H and 12.7 g 0.12 mole sodium carbonate were stirred while adding 7.4 g 0.04 mole cyanuric chloride in small portions. The resulting mixture was stirred and heated at 900 C. for 5 hrs. The reaction mixture was stirred well with 150 ml hot water and the flask and contents allowed to cool. The upper aqueous phase was discarded and the remaining solid product was removed from the flask and dried under vacuum to yield 82.5 g of semisolid, cyanurate product No. C 6 ofTable 2 . Example 10 Example 1 was followed except that the amount of ethyl bromide employed was 53.5 g 0.5 mole . After removal of the DMF by distillation, water and isopropyl ether were added to the residue, and the ether phase was evaporated to yield 29 g of a white, isocyanurate solid No. I 4 of Table 1 , melting at 137 1440C. Example 11 Example 1 was followed except that 156 g 1.1 mole methyl iodide was reacted with the isocyanuric acid in place of ethyl bromide. Forty two g of a white, isocyanate solid No. I 5 of Table 1 was obtained, with a purity of 98.9 dimethyl isocyanurate for the product as indicated by gas liquid chromatography. Example 12 Example 1 was followed except that a mixture of 109 g 1.0 mole ethyl bromide and 60.5 g 0.5 mole allyl bromide were used in place of the ethyl bromide. The reaction mixture was subjected to vacuum distillation to remove DMF and the residue shaken with a mixture of isopropyl ether and water. The ether layer was separated and evaporated to yield 57.5 g of a solid, isocyanurate product No. I 6 of Table 1 as the major product. Example 13 Employing the apparatus of Example 1 153.5 g 1.0 mole phosphorous oxychloride and 300 g p dioxane were placed in the reaction flask and 14.4 ml water added to the stirred solution while cooling with a water bath.Tris hydroxyethyl isocyanurate 87 g, 0.33 mole was then added and the reaction mixture stirred and heated at 800C on a steam bath. The solids which formed after 1 hr. of heating dissolved on further heating to yield a clear solution. Heating was stopped when no further HCl gas evolution was observed. Water 18 ml was added to the solution and the reaction mixture stirred for 1 hr. at 400C and allowed to stand overnight 16 hrs at room temperature. The p dioxane solvent was stripped from the reaction mixture under reduced pressure up to a pot temperature of about 800C. Isopropyl ether 300 ml was added and the reaction mixture stirred and then cooled.The ether was decanted and the solid residue washed with 200 ml heptane and subjected to reduced pressure while heating to a pot temperature of 900C to remove volatiles.The isocyanurate product wt 180 g No. 1 7 of Table 1 was thus obtained as a viscous liquid. Example 14 In a number of runs, fluoroelastomer gums A and B of Table 3 were compounded with processing agents of this invention and certain conventional vulcanizing adjuvants on a two roll rubber mill. In each run, 100 parts of elastomer gum was compounded with 2.1 parts Bisphenol AF, i.e., 2 ,2 hexafluoroisopropylidene bis 4 hydroxybenzene , 0.45 part triphenylbenzylphosphonium chloride, 3 parts magnesium oxide MAGLITE D , 6 parts calcium hydroxide, 30 parts carbon black N 990 , and a small amount of the processing aid except in control runs where no processing aid was used for comparison .The resulting compounded gumstocks were extruded through a Garvey type extrusion die at 1100C., and the resulting rubber extrusions were evaluated according to ASTM Standard Method D 2230 77 Method A, Rating System B, to rate the appearance of the surfaces and edges of the extrusions. This ASTM test rates the visual appearance of the surface of the extrusion on a scale from A very smooth or excellent to E rough or poor , the edge of the extrusion on a scale of 1 ragged, rough, or poor to 10 sharp, uniform or excellent . In addition, the gloss and the flatness of the extrusions were evaluated visually, the gloss being rated as P dull or poor , F fair , or G shiny or good , and the flatness of the extrusion being rated as H waves or high undulations , M moderately wavy , L low degree of waves , or L very flat, no waves . The compositions of the compounded gumstocks and appearance of the rubber extrusions thereof are summarized in Table 4. Example 15 In another series of runs, fluoroelastomer gums D and E of Table 3 were compounded with common vulcanizing adjuvants and processing aids of this invention, using the compounding procedures described in Example 14, and extrusions of such compounded compositions were likewise evaluated. In each run, 100 parts of the elastomer was compounded with 2.5 parts 2,5 dimethyl 2,5 bis t butylperoxy hexane LUPERCO 101XL, 40 active , 2.5 parts triallylisocyanurate, 3 parts litharge Eagle Picher 33 , and 40 parts carbon black N 990 . The foregoing work is summarized in Table 5. Example 16 In another series of runs, two other commercially available gums, namely NBR, a nitrile rubber, polybutadiene co acrylonitrile RRYNAC 34.80 and SBR, poly butadiene co styrene PLIOFLEX SBR 1502 , were compounded with common vulcanizing adjuvants and processing aids of this invention except in a control run , using the compounding procedures described in Example 14, and extrusions of such compounded compositions were likewise evaluated.In runs 1 and 2 and a control run, 100 parts of the NBR elastomer was compounded with 0.4 part tetramethylthiuramdisulfide, 1.5 parts sulfur, 5 parts zinc oxide, and 40 parts carbon black N55O . In runs 3 and 4, 100 parts of the SBR elastomer was compounded with 1 part mercaptobenzothiazoledisulfide, 2 parts sulfur, 3 parts zinc oxide, 50 parts carbon black N 990 , and 1 part di beta naphthyl p phenylenediamine. The foregoing work is summarized in Table 6 Example 17 In another series of runs, fluoroelastomer gum C of Table 3 was compounded with common vulcanizing adjuvants and the processing aids of this invention, using the compounding procedures described in Example 14.In each run, 100 parts of the gum was compounded with 2.5 parts LUPERCO 101XL, 2.5 parts triallylisocyanurate, 10 parts litharge Eagle Picher num 33 , 40 parts carbon black N774 , and 20 parts carbon black AUSTIN black . All of the compounded compositions were press cured in an untreated mold at 177 C for 10 min. at about 7x103 kPa and the mold release properties determined in terms of the minimum amount of processing aid useful to obtain good release of the cured molded article from the mold and in terms of the quality of release e.g., G for good release and P for poor release when 3 phr of the processing aid was used.The foregoing work is summarized in Table 7. Example 18 In another series of runs, fluoroelastomer gum F of Table 3 was compounded according to the procedure ofExample 14 with processing aid I 7 of Table 1 and the extrusions of such compounded compositions were evaluated.In each run, 100 parts of the gum was compounded with 3 parts LUPERCO l0lXL, 3 parts triallylisocyanurate, 10 parts zinc oxide, 10 parts PbHPO3 DYPHOS , and 10 parts carbon black N 990 .
