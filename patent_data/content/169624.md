# Touch control apparatus for electronic keyboard instrument.

## Abstract
A touch control apparatus for an electronic keyboard instrument, comprises a sensor having an elongated in sulating sheet 22 having a set of conductive pattern films 24,25 on a surface thereof, the elongated insulating sheet 22 being folded and the set of conductive pattern films 24,25 being formed to be spaced apart from each other and a pressure sensitive element 23 sandwiched in a space defined by the folded elongated insulating sheet 22 to be in contact with the conductive pattern films 24,25 . The pressure sensitive element 23 is deformed when a key of the instrument is depressed to deliver an electrical output through the conductive films 24,25 representing the magni tude of the key depression. The apparatus is superior in easiness of handling the sensor and of assembling the apparatus.
