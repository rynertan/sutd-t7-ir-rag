# Process and apparatus for raising a pile on textile fabric.

## Abstract
A fabric abrasion process comprises the steps of forwarding fabric 5 along a path which brings a surface 12 of the fabric in contact with a yieldable abrading element, for example a roller 1, comprising abrasive particles supported by a yieldable body, and exerting pressure on the fabric 5, for example by means of a pressure bar 3, to urge it against said abrading element and cause a depression therein, thereby producing a pile on said surface of the fabric as the fabric passes over the abrading element.
