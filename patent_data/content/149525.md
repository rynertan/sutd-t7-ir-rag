# FIRE RESISTANT ENCLOSURES

## Abstract
The body of a cabinet for storing temperature sensitive articles such as magnetic discs and tapes is built by a process which involves the successive steps of i fabricating an internal skin 1 ii attaching so called phase change material 3 to the skin iii applying polyurethane foam 6 in situ to the structure of step ii iv casting concrete or the like water bearing material 11 around the structure of step iii and v completing the outer finishing skin 9 12. Thus the conventional double box structure is avoided. The door for the cabinet can be built by a similar sequence in which phase change material, insulative foam and water bearing layers 14, 18, 21 are applied successively to a pan 13 forming the internal face of the door.
