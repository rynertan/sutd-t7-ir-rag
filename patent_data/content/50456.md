## Description
ELECTRIC MOTOR The present invention relates to motors, more particularly to AC synchronous motors capable of autostart in which the structure consists of a permanentmagnet rotor, a stator, brushes, and a commutator in connection with the rotor, and that the commutator is provided with a rectifying means which rotates in union with the rotor so that, of the AC current supplied from the power supply, the component required to energize rotor s rotation is fed to stator coil. Conventional AC synchronous motors use various auxiliary starting means for acceleration at starting up to synchronous speed. Such means are undesirably complicated for cost saving, miniaturization, or weight reduction. Several means have been devised to remove these demerits. Shizuo Karasawa, SYNCHRONOUS MOTOR , U.S.P.1992826 is for single phase synchronous motors, in which the rotor shaft is provided with a common terminal and a commutator with segments corresponding to the rotor pole positions with 1800 circumferential angle and in which rectifiers with opposite directions have one end connected to the common terminal and their other ends connected to brushes in sliding contact with the above mentioned commutator segments. As a consequence of this structure, at starting, a DC pulsed current corresponding to rotor s magnetic poles is passed through the exciting coil to energize the rotation of the rotor i a prevscribed direction until the synchronous sped is attained, where synchronous operation is effected. Similar technologicai ideas are made known by Mallory, SYNCHRONOUS MOTOR STATOR CIRCUIT EMPLOYING COMMUTATOR ANDRECTIFIER DURING STARTING , U.S.P. 3394296 and Itsuki Ban, SYNCHRONIZED DC MOTORS , Japanese Application Laid open Showa 48 l973 773l8. The present inventor, noticing the feature of these patents that their motors are provided with immobile rectifiers, researched to have rectifiers installed within the commutator rotate in union with the commutator, and succeeded in producing an extremely simple starting means. By this means synchronous motors may.be produced of lighter weight and smaller size and at lower cost and which have an extremely high power efficiency. Also the present invention can provide synchronous motors with simplified conversion circuits, applicable for three phase power supply, which do not employ three stage of conversion means for switching the stator poles but use unified conversion circuits. The principle of the present motor can be stated as follows. Let the number of poles for the motor .be .2n n is an integral number . The rotor has its 2n pole permanent magnet disposed around the rotor shaft with circumferential angle 2t 2n so that the poles are arranged alternately.The stator has m n pieces of coil wound field core, driven by rectified current, disposed around the rotor shaft at m af n positions. having circumferential angle intervals. A commutator composed of 2n sliders has its sliders disposed around the rotor shaft at equal 2v 2n intervals. The sliderg are connected one to another via one or more rectifiers so that the sliders are made conductive alternately in the order 2 , , , , and so on in the circumferential direction.At, least one pair of fixed brushes are provided, one brush of a pair contacting a slider while the other contacts a slider, one of the brushes of the or each pair being connected directly to the AC power supply and the other to the same terminal of the stator coils.

Fig. 11 illustrates the principle of 4 pole threephase motors. An embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to Fig. 1. The rotor 10 is a permanent magnet, which is composed of two poles and which rotates with rotor shaft 12. The .stator 14 has its field core wound with coil 16 and is positioned close to rotor 10. The sliders 18a and 18b are disposed around rotor shaft 12 on an insulator 20 close to rotor 10. One of them corresponds to the circumferential angle from N to S pole of rotor 10 and the other to that from S to N pole. There are fixed gaps between the sliders, each of which covers a circumferential angle slightly less than 1800. A diode 22 serves to allow current to flow from slider 18a to 18b. Brushes 18c and 18d are in contact with sliders 18a and 184 respectively.Rotation of the sliders will cause alternate contact between the brushes and sliders. Brush 18c is connected to power supply 24 via coil 16, whereas brush 18d is connected directly to power supply 24. This structure permits the turning on of AC power supply 24 to let diode 22 pass current through coil 16 only while the phase corresponds to positive half waves in such a direction as magnetizes poles 26 and 28 to become N andS poles, respectively. This magnetization will give rotor 10 a turning force in the arrow marked direction A. When rotor 10 rotates to bring sliders 18b and 18a into contact with brushes 18c and 18d, respectively, current will be caused to flow through coil 16 in such a direction as reverses the magnetization of poles 26 and 28, i.e. poles 26 and 28 become S and N poles, respectively.This magnetization will give rotor 10 further accelerative turning force in the arrow marked direction A. Thus, the poles of coil 16 are reversed between N and S poles every 1800 rotation of rotor 10 with resulting continued acceler.ation, until the rotor becomes synchronous with the AC of the power supply. A 2 pole embodiment of the present invention has been described. However, the technological idea of the present invention is applicable in general to 2n pole motors n being an integral number . Fig. 2 provides an example of the application of the present invention to 4 pole motors. In both Figs. 1 and 2, the same structural elements are indicated by the same reference numbers. In motors with four or more poles, for example, as shown in Fig. 2, stator 14 consists at least of an adjacent pair of poles 26 and 28. It should be noted that if, in addition to stator 14, we have another stator not shown with a.pair of poles opposite to those of stator 14 with a 180 phase difference, it produces increased torque. In this case, all the coils of the stators may be connected using brush 18c in common. Fig..3 shows the cross sectional structure of a switching device 30 equiped with sliders 118a, 118b, 118c, and 118d for the case of 4 pole motor. The sliders are disposed around rotary shaft 12 on insulator 20, each corresponding to the circumferential angle at which each pole on rotor 10 is disposed. There are fixed gaps between the sliders, each slider covering a circumferential angle slightly less than 900. Slider 118a is connected to the clockwise adjacent slider 118b via diode 22 in such a way that current will flow from slider 118a to slider 118b.Sliders 118a and 118b are connected directly to sliders 118c and 118d, respectively. Brushes 18c and 18d are, at the point shown, in contact with sliders 118a and 118d, respectively, brush 18c is connected to power supply 24 via coil 16, and brush 18d is connected directly to power supply 24. This structure permits the turning on of AC power supply 24 to let diode 22 pass current through coil 16 only while the phase corresponds to positive half waves in such a direction as to magnetize poles 26 and 28 to become N andS poles, respectively. This magnetization will give rotor 10 a .turn ng force in the arrow marked direction A. When rotor 10 rotates to bring sliders 118b and 118c into contact with brushes 18c and 18d, respectively, current will be caused to flow through coil 16 in such a direction as reverses the magnetization 26 and 28, i.e. poles 26 and 28 become S and N poles, respectively. This magnetization will give rotor 10 further accelerative turning force in the arrow marked direction A. Thus, the poles of coil 16 are reversed between N and S poles every 90 rotation of rotor 10 with resulting continued acceleration, until them rotor becomes synchronous with the AC of the power supply. Fig. 4 shows the cross sectional structure of sliders 218a,218b,218c,218d,218e, and 218f in the case of a 6 pole motor. Slider 218a is connected to the clockwiseadjacent slider 218b via diode. 22 in such a way that current will flow from slider 218a to slider 218b. Sliders 218a and 218b are connected directly to sliders 218c and 218f via sliders 218e and 218d, respectively. Brushes 18c and 18d are in contact with sliders 218a and 218d, respectively, with the sliders opposing to each other. The brushes may be in contact with sliders 218a and 218b disposed adjacent to each other. In general, the pair of brushes may be disposed anywhere as long as one touches a slider and the other a t slider. Also, in general, even if the sliders are disposed so as not to be in correspondence with the disposition of the rotor s poles but to have a phase difference corresponding to a constant circumferential angle, an equivalent operation will result if the brushes are placed at positions spaced apart by that circumferential angle. In the case of 2n pole motors, the 2n arcuate slider pieces are disposed around a rotary plate placed perpendicular to the rotor shaft and a pair of brushes may be provided in contact with these sliders not shown . The present invention may be applied to construction of 3 phase AC motors by having three sets of two sliders connected with a dio de containing wiring, a pair of brushes corresponding to the sliders, and a stator connected in the above mentioned relation disposed with 1200 phase displacement to one another in correspondence with the 3phase AC power supply not shown . The output of the motors described above may greatly be improved if, in the cyclic circuit from AC power supply 24 via switching device. 30 Fig. 5 and stator coil 16 to power supply 24, is placed a condenser 32 between switching device 30 and coil 16 in series as shown in Fig. 5 or in parallel as shown in Fig. 6, thus forming an LC circuit.When both the poles of condenser.32 are short circuited, the phase of the current is essentially delayed 900 to the voltage and accordingly, in the absence of condenser.32, the rotation of the rotor while .being approximately in the synchronous state will allow coil 16 to have only about half the half wave current flowing, whereas in the presence of condenser 32, the phase of the current flowing through coil 1Q is caused to advance so as to allow almost all the half wave current to flow. The present invention may be embodied also by disposing the permanent magnet rotor on the outside and the stator on the inside, as follows. In Fig. 7, a permanent magnet rotor 110 in the form of ring has cap 112 capable of shielding magnetic flux and which is designed to rotate in union with rotor shaft 12. The stator 114 is fixed on bearing 100 of rotor shaft 12 and is inserted into the space .between the rotor shaft 12 and rotor 110. The coil is shown at 116 and the above mentioned condenser 32 is provided for improving the input. Such motors also may employ a switching device 30. Fig. 8 illustr.ates stator. 114 for the motor shown in Fig. 7. Here, the rotor 110 is sometimes positioned at a dead point where. the magnetic field produced by coil 116 is in equilibrium with the magnetic field produced by the permanent magnet of rotor 110 with respect to repulsion and attraction, thereby preventing rotor 110 from starting its rotation. To counter this the field core of stator 114 has a shading coil 50. The short circuit current flowing through shading coil 50 will produce a magnetic field which is essentially different in phase by 900 from the magnetic field produced at the pole of stator 114, resulting in a state of magnetic non equilibrium. Thus, rotor 110 can leave the dead point, and start to rotate.A shading coil 50 may be applied to any single phase AC motor hitherto described. When using a three phase power supply, instead of having the above mentioned 3 stage.set of conversion means with 1200 phase difference, the conversion circuit may be united and simplified, as described below. In Fig. 9, stator 210 is disposed in the form of Y with 120 angles between adjacent cores, and core sections 210al, 210a2,.and 210a3 have coils 210b1, 210b2, and 210b3, respectively, wound via condenser 220 for adjusting the phase of the current. A permanent magnet rotor 230 has two poles in the form of cylinder and rotates around stator 210 supported by rotor shaft 240. A commutator 250 consists of two concentr.ic circles positioned close to each other. Each circle is divided into four sliders each with a circumferential extent of 900. All the sliders are held in position by means of insulator 242. The commutator may rotate in union with a rotor shaft 240. In Fig. 9, the outer sliders are 250a1N250a4 and the inner sliders are 250bl 250b4. For the slider sets of 250al and 250bl and of 250a2 and 250b2 diodes 261 and 262 are provided, respectively, in the direction 250bl 250al and.250b2 250a2 and for. the slider sets of 250a3 and 250b3 and of 250a4 and 250b4, diodes 263 and 264 are provided, respectively in the direction 250a3 250b3 and 250a4 250b4. Three pairs of brushes 260 are disposed with 1200 phase difference between them. In the pairs of 260a1 and 260b1, of 260a2 and 260b2, and of 260a3 and 260b3, the brushes 260al, 260a2, and 260a3 are in turn in sliding contact with sliders 250a1, 250a2, 250a3, and 250a4 while brushes 260bl, 260b2, and 260b3 are in turn in sliding contact with sliders 250b1, 250b2, 250b3, and 250b4. Brush 260a1 is connected to the 1st phase of the AC power supply via coil 210bl and brush 260b1 is connected directly to the 1st phase brush 260a2 is connected to the 2nd phase via coil 210b2 and brush 260a3 is connected to the. 3rid phase via coil 210b3. Consider the circuit leading from the 1st phase of the AC power supply via brushes 260bl and 260awl to coil 210bl. With core section 210al corresponding to pole A of rotor 230, while the rotor 230 rotates through 1800 diodes 261 and 262 having the same direction with each other cause current to pass from brush 260bl to brush 260al, producing pole S on core 210al. While the rotor 230 rotates through another 18001 diodes 263 and 264 cause current to pass from brush 260al to brush 260bl, producing pole N on core 210al. The production of poles S and N is accompanied by evolution of a turning force.Cores 210a2 and 210a3, in correspondence with the phase difference of brush 60, work similarly with 120 phase delay, supplying the rotor with a turning force. With this motor no disabling of rotor 230 on starting will occur since the commutator 250 is divided circumferentially at 900 angles, and accordingly even when one pair of brushes are on the insulated gaps the other two pairs of brushes are conductive. If three sets of sliders each of 1800 circumferential extent, disposed with circumferential angles of 60 between them, had diodes of the same direction connected, all the three pairs of brushes might happen to be simultaneously on the insulated gaps, with resultant disabling of the rotor. Fig. 10 is a c.ut away illustration of the construction of the 2 pole three phase motor. Permanent magnet rotor 230 is attached to a rotor shaft 240 via connector 232 in such a manner that it surrounds stator 210 with its core 210a wound with coil 210b. Sliders 250a and 250b are attached to frusto conical insulator 242 which rotates in union with connector 232. Fig. 11 illustrates the principle of 4 pole threephase AC motors. Rotary slider 250 is divided into four sets of sliders with circumferential angle 900. In Fig. 11, the outer sliders are. 250al N250a4 and the inner sliders are 250bl V250b4t. Diodes 261 , 262 , 263 , and 264 are provided to allow current to pass, respectively, in the directions 250bl 250al for the slider set of 250al and 250bl 250b2 for the set of 250a2 and 250b2 250b3 250a3 for the set of 250a3 and 250b3 and 250a4 250b4 for the set of 250a4 and 250b4 . Core 210al is connected to the 1st phase of the power supply, core 210a2 to the. 3rd, and core 210a3 to the 2nd. Rotor 230 is disposed outside stator 210, but it may be disposed inside the stator, or a planar rotor may be disposed in combination with a planar stator i.e. of axial gap configuration , and it may be applicable to a single phaseAC synchronous motor. As described above, the present invention may enable motors to be simpler, smaller, and lighter the invention may be applied to multi pole as well as 2 pole motors, and also to both single and three phase motors the invention may achieve an increase in output with the aid of condenser.
