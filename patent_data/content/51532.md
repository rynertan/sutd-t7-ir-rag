# Regulated MOS substrate bias voltage generator for a static random access memory.

## Abstract
A regulated substrate bias voltage generating system for maintaining a minimum data retaining current through an associated MOS memory. The negative substrate bias voltage is generated by a charge pump operating under the control of a two phased output oscillator, the operation of which is enabled and disabled by the output signals from a MOS memory over current sensor, a MOS under current sensor, and a bias voltage level sensor.
