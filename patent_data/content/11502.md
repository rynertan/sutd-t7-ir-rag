# Particulate detergent composition contained within a closed bag of sheet material.

## Abstract
A detergent product comprises a water insoluble, water permeable bag containing a particulate detergent composition, the bag material having a water soluble or removable water insoluble layer to protect the bag material from the composition and to reduce dusting. The protective layer may be coated on or impregnated into the bag material or may form a continuous layer laminated to the inside of the bag material or may be in the form of a separate inner bag. The water soluble material may be soluble polyvinyl alcohol, polytheylene glycol, polysaccharide, alkali metal silicate, soap, nonionic detergent, gelatine, salts or esters of alginic acid. The removable water insoluble material may be a silicone, a fatty acid, a water insoluble cationic fabric sof tener, polyvinylacetate, insoluble polyvinyl alcohol, clay, zeolite, calcite, silica, titania or a wax. The bag material may be paper and or plastics material such as polypropylene. The detergent composition is a fully formulated composition or other fabric treatment material.
