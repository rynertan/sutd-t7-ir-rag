# LIQUID CRYSTAL MULTI COLOR DISPLAY DEVICE.

## Abstract
In a liquid crystal multi color display device, if a color filter 2 is formed by printing over or under an electrode 1 , the film thickness does not become uniform but forms steps, causing the orientation processing to become non uniform and reducing the conductivity of the electrodes. With this invention, the color filter 2 is formed by printing in com pliance with the following equation 1 in which the printing parameter has a value a of greater than 20, and duplication on the neighboring color filters ranges from α 3 to α 30 µ, so that the surface is smoothed T denotes a maximum film thickness of the color filter 2 , and ϑ denotes an internal contact angle defined by a line that connect a point corre sponding to a position of film thickness T 2 on the surface of color Filter 2 and an intersecting point of the edge of color filter 2 and the substrate relative to the substrate.
