## Description
The invention relates to an absorbable surgical fastener such as a ligating clip or a surgical staple of the staple receiver type, made from glycolide rich blends of polymers. Surgical staples and ligating clips are beginning to come into wide use in the surgical profession as an alternative to sutures and ligatures. One advantage of clips and staples in comparison with sutures and ligatures is that tissue fastening or ligating with a staple or clip, whether applied singly or as an array applied in a row or in a ring, is much simpler and faster than with a suture or a ligature. Surgical procedures can be speeded up, thereby reducing the length of time the patient must be anesthetized and shortening the operating room time. Thus, there are both medical and economic reasons for the shift to staples and clips from sutures and ligatures. The first surgical staples to be used, and still the majority being used, were metal staples. But metal staples, when used externally, must be removed, with accompanying patient discomfort. And when metal staples are used internally, they are left in place. While the metal staples are tiny and become encapsulated by natural processes, and little or no difficulty has been associated with such staples left in the patient, for internal applications, surgeons would prefer to use absorbable materials that eventually disappear after their usefulness has ended. For this reason, there is a substantial incen tive to develop an absorbable plastic surgical staple. It appears to be out of the question to produce an absorb able plastic surgical staple of reasonable size that fastens simply by bending back on itself in a manner analogous to the way metal staples fasten. The available absorbable plastics simply lack the required combination of ductility and stiffness that would be required for this purpose. For this reason, the initial attempts to produce an acceptable absorbable plastic surgical staple has concentrated on the staple receiver type of fastener. In this type of fastener, a staple member includes a cross piece or base and one or more attached legs which are designed to pierce the tissue to be fastened and to enter receptacles in the receiver on the other side of the tissue. The receiver holds the legs tightly, with the tissue being held between the cross piece or base and the receiving member. The desirable characteristics of such a fastener are the following It has not proven to be an easy matter to obtain the requisite combination of properties. For instance, early designs of absorbable surgical staples utilized temporary metal reinforcement for the fastener legs during insertion of the staple to insure adequate stiffness. For instance, see Noiles, U. S. Patent No. 4,060,089 and Green, U. S. Patent No. 4,402,445. A presently commercial absorbable clip and an early commercial absorbable staple are made from an 80 20 lactide glycolide mol mol copolymer. These fasteners have the disadvantage that they are dimensionally unstable when heated to temperatures over 120 F 49 C . Therefore, care must be taken in handling these fasteners, because temperatures well over 120 F. are commonly encountered in shipping and storage in the United States during the warmer months. A later commercial surgical staple is made from either of two blends of lactide and glycolide polymers such that the blend has greater than 50 per cent lactide based moieties. Specifically, it has an overall lactide glycolide ratio of 71 29 or 64 36, by weight. Absorbable ligating clips made from poly p dioxanone have recently been introduced commercially. Metallic ligating clips have been used for some time. This invention provides an absorbable surgical fastener, such as a surgical staple, a ligating clip, an anastomotic coupler, a fascia closure, or the like, that has an over all composition containing more than 50 per cent of poly merized glycolide, and provides, unexpectedly, a highly desirable combination of properties. With such a high glycolide content, one would have expected the subject devices to have limited strength retention This invention provides a surgical fastener comprising a glycolide rich blend of polymers. In one preferred aspect the invention provides a surgical staple comprising In another preferred aspect, the invention provides a hemostatic ligating clip comprising said glycolide rich blend of polymers. Among the advantages of the invention are the ability to injection mold the parts made from the blend of the injection, and the fact that the parts retain measurable strength for a long enough time after implantation to perform the required task, and yet the parts become non palpable only six to ten weeks after implantation in living tissue. This latter feature is a truly valuable and unexpected advantage. Green, in U.S. Patent No. 4,402,445, discloses absorbable surgical staples made from, inter alia, an amorphous copolymer of 10 50 by weight glycolide and 50 90 lactide.... and from ...polymers of p dioxanone... Noiles, in U.S. Patent No. 4,060,089, discloses the preparation of surgical staples from polyglycolic acid and polylactic acid. Mericle, in U.S. Patent No. 4,428,376, discloses the preparation of surgical staples from homopolymers and copolymers of lactide, glycolide, and p dioxanone. Golden et al., in United States Patent application serial No. 359,443, filed March 18, 1982, discloses an absorbable staple in which the fastening member is made from an absorbable polymer of glycolide and lactide and the receiving member is made from polydioxanone. The said Golden et al. application is assigned to the same assignee as this application. Doddi et al., in US. Patent No. 4,052,988, disclose surgical devices made from poly p dioxanone . World patent application WO8401 508 A describes absorbable surgical fasteners made from copolymers containing 70 85 mole per cent lactide and 15 30 mole per cent glycolide. The invention resides in the use in a surgical fastener of a blend of at least two polymers, the overall blend being rich in polymerized glycolide. The blend of polymers used in the invention is glycolide rich, that is, the blend as a whole contains from about 65 to about 85 weight per cent polymerized glycolide, the remainder being polymerized lactide. At least one of the polymers in the blend is polyglycolide homopolymer or a predominantly glycolide copolymer containing, e.g., at least about 90 weight per cent glycolide, the remainder being lactide. Also, at least one of the polymers in the blend is polylactide homopolymer or a predominantly lactide copolymer containing, e.g., at least 85 weight per cent lactide, the remainder being glycolide. The two or more polymers used in the blend are used in such proportions that, overall, the blend contains from about 65 to about 85 weight per cent of polymerized glycolide, the remainder being polymerized lactide. The polymers used in the invention are known materials. For instance, they are disclosed in United States patents to Schneider No. 3,797,499 , Salzberg No. 2,758,987 , and Schmitt et al. No. 3,739,773 . As a rule, the lactide hompolymers and lactide rich copolymers will have molecular weights such that they have inherent viscosities of from about 1 to about 3 and preferably about 1.5 to 1.9, dl gm, tested at 25 C. at a concentration of 0.1 gm dl in hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol HFIP . The glycolide homopolymers and glycolide rich copolymers are easier to characterize by melt index than by inherent viscosity because of their poor solubility in organic solvents. They usually have melt index values of from about 0.1 to about 0.9, and preferably from about 0.2 to about 0.6, gram per 10 minutes. The melt index is determined by the procedure described in ASTM D 1238 73 using a thoroughly dried sample of polymer , using a 26 mil die orifice, a weight of 3700 grams plus the 100 gram piston weight, at a temperature of 235 C. The melt index is the weight of polymer taken during the interval from 15 to 16 minutes after beginning the test, multiplied by 10. Poly p dioxanone , one preferred polymer for use in the receiver member of a surgical staple of the staple receiver type, is also a known material. Its nature and preparation are described, for instance, in Doddi et al., U. S. Patent No. 4,052,988. Poly p dioxanone having an inherent viscosity of from about 1.2 to about 2.2, and preferably about 1.6 to 1.9, dl gm, tested at 25 C. and a concentration of 0.1 gm dl in HFIP, is normally used in the invention. The blend of the invention may also be used as the receiver. In one preferred aspect, the invention provides a surgical staple of the staple receiver type wherein the staple member is the blend of the invention and the receiver is an absorbable polymer, such as poly p dioxanone or a blend similar to or the same as that used in the staple member. The staple can be made by injection molding of the two parts. The staple member, which is made of a blend of two or more polymers, can be injection molded at tempera tures within the range of from about 215 C. to about 225 C. at an injection molding pressure of, for example, 1650 to 1750 psi. These conditions are typical for the preferred 70 30 polyglycolide polylactide blend disclosed in the Examples below. These conditions are also used if the blend is used as the receiver. Typically, the feed for the injection molder will be a melt blend of the polymers in pellet form, although a dry blend of the polymers in finely divided form can be fed to the injec tion molding machine, provided sufficient mixing in the injection molding machine occurs. The receiver member, when made of poly p dioxanone , can be injection molded at a temperature within the range of from about 105 C. to about 120 C., at a pressure of, for example, about 1350 to 1450 psi. The polymers should be quite dry when being injection molded in order to avoid hydrolytic degradation during processing. After molding, the staple can be packaged and sterilized by conventional procedures. It is recommended that the polymers be handled so as to minimize premature hydrolytic degradation or thermal degradation. Thus, the polymers should be stored dry before molding, the molding operation should be dry, and the molded parts should be stored dry. Also, residence time in the extruder should be kept to a minimum so as to minimize thermal and shear degradation. Figures 1 3 show a typical surgical staple of the invention. The staple member 10 includes a base 12 and two legs 14,16 extending generally perpendicularly from the base 12. Each leg 14,16 has a pointed end 18,20 that is capable of piercing tissue. The legs 14,16 are arranged and constructed so as to snap fit into the receptacles 22,24 of a receiver 26. In a typical use, layers 28,30 of tissue to be fastened are positioned between the staple member 10 and the receiver 26. The legs 14,16 of the staple member 10 are driven through the layers 28,30 of tissue, as shown in Fig. 2, until the ends of the legs 14,16 snap fit in the receptacles 22,24 in the receiver 26, to thereby hold the tissue securely between the staple member 10 and receiver 26, as is shown in Fig. 3. The design of staple member and receiver shown in the figures is merely illustrative. Other designs can be used, if desired. In another preferred aspect of the invention, there is provided a hemostatic ligating clip comprising the blend of the invention. The advantages of the clip comprising the blend of the invention compared to clips made wholly of poly p dioxanone are the following Referring to the drawings Figs. 4 9 , there is shown a clip 40 that can be used in the invention. As depicted in Fig. 4, the clip comprises a pair of leg members 41 and 42 having opposed vessel clamping surfaces 43 and 44. The leg members are connected at their proximal ends by a resilient hinge portion 45. The distal end of one of the leg members terminates in a return bend hook portion 46. The opposite leg member is somewhat shorter and terminates at its distal end in a portion 47 which can grasped by the hook portion. The end of this leg member is angled at an obtuse angle to the vessel clamping surface. This angle aids in deflecting the hook portion as the two leg members are brought together about the hinge and allows the hook portion to deflect and then accept the leg member in the area between the inner surface 48 of the hook portion and the vessel clamping surface 43 of the opposite leg member. The hook portion includes a sharpened pointed end 49 extending from the hook portion and positioned to lead the hook portion or preceed the hook portion as the clip is being closed. As shown in Fig. 5, the hook portion has a protrusion 50 dispersed from the central portion of its inner surface 40. This protrusion fits into the recess 51 see Fig. 6 positioned in the outer surface 52 of the opposite leg member 42. The protrusion and recess interlock when the clip is closed to prevent lateral movement of the leg members. The outside surfaces of the leg members each include a cylindrical boss 53 and 54 for use in holding the clip in a suitable instrument and applying the clip from said instrument as will hereinafter be described. As may be more clearly seen in Figs. 7, 8, and 9, when the clip 40 is clamped about a vessel 61 to be closed, assuming that the vessel has not been fully dissected from the surrounding connective tissue 62 such as would be found in the mesentary , the vessel clamping surfaces are placed on opposite sides of the vessel and the leg members urged together about the resilient hinge . The penetrat ing sharpened end 64 of the one leg member 65 will pinch and scrape the connective tissue between itself and the camming surface 68 of the other leg member 66. This scraping action enhances the tissue penetrating ability of the sharpened end. Once the tissue is penetrated the usual sequence of closure takes place. As the leg members are urged closer together the leg member 66 continues to deflect the hook portion 67 and becomes engaged by the leg member 65 thereby locking the clip in place about the vessel without tissue interference with latch security. Though in the embodiment shown the penetrating means is a sharpened beveled end, the penetrating means may have other configurations such as a pointed end tapered at a plurality of sides, a pointed end, a plurality of pointed ends, etc. In Fig. 10, there is shown a simplified drawing of an instrument for applying the clip described above. This instrument 70 comprises a pair of handles 71 and 72 which are connected together at a hinge point 73. The handles are biased with respect to one another by a spring 74. One of the handles extends beyond the hinge point in a first jaw member 75 and the opposite handle extends beyond the hinge point in a complementary second jaw member 76. The instrument engaging means comprises cylindrical bosses 53, 54 in Fig. 4 extending from the back surfaces of the leg members of the clip 77. These bosses fit into recesses in the jaws of the instrument. The clip is placed in the jaws with the cylindrical boses in the appropriate recesses. The vessel clamping surfaces of the clip are then placed on opposite sides of the vessel to be closed and the instrument handles urged together closing and locking the clip about the vessel and shutting off the vessel. The clip can be injection molded by the procedure set forth above with respect to the staple member of the surgical staple of the invention. After injection molding, the parts made of the blend of the invention can be annealed to enhance dimensional stability at elevated temperature. The annealing usually increases the degree of crystallinity. Polyglycolide homopolymer and glycolide rich copolymers often develop crystallinity in the mold, and this degree of crystallin ity may be sufficient in some cases. The parts made from the blend of the invention usually exhibit about 15 to about 45 per cent crystallinity, measured by X ray diffraction. The annealing, which is preferably done in a vacuum or under an inert atmosphere such as dry nitrogen, can be carried out at about 50 to 140 C., and preferably at about 60 C. to 80 C., for at least an hour. An annealing time of about 2 to 20 hours is preferred. Surgical staples having the design shown in Figs. 1 3 were made by injection molding. The receivers were all made from poly p dioxanone having an inherent viscosity of 1.6 1.8 in HFIP. The staple members were made from a blend of 70 parts by weight of polyglycolide homopolymer having a melt index 0.291, and 30 parts by weight of polylactide homopolymer having an inherent viscosity in HFIP of 1.78. Prior to injection molding, the polymers, in coarse ground form, were dried under vacuum for a period of two weeks. They were dry blended and fed to the injection molding machine as a dry blend. Dryness was maintained during molding by using a dry nitrogen purge in the hopper of the injection molding machine. After molding, the samples were maintained under vacuum or under a dry nitrogen purge until they were tested. The fasteners were annealed at 60 C. for 16 hours after molding. The fasteners of the invention maintain measurable holding strength The procedure for testing the separation force is the following An Instron Tensiometer is set as follows Crosshead speed 0.5 inch minute Chart speed 5.0 inches minute Gauge Length 1.5 inches Full scale load as follows The staple members are inserted in the receivers, leaving a slight gap to simulate the space taken up by tissue, and are then placed in the phosphate buffer at 37 C. The samples are tested initially and after 7, 14, 21, and 28 days. The separation force is measured by engaging the cross piece e.g., part 12 in Fig. 1 of the staple member with a tab of an Instron test fixture, and pulling against a strip of polyester film that has been bent around the receiver by passing it through the gap between cross piece of the staple member and the receiver. The polyester film is cut so that it is just narrow enough to fit through said gap. Typical initial separation forces vary from about 8 to 9 pounds, and typical separation forces after 21 days in phosphate buffer at 37 C. are from one half to one pound. After 42 days While the invention has been described most specifically in terms of a surgical staple or a hemostatic ligating clip, other types of surgical fasteners can be made from the blend of the invention. Such fasteners include fascia closures and anastomotic couplers.
