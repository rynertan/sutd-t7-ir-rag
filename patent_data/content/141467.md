# Device for applying a fixing medium to electronic components, more particularly to chip type components.

## Abstract
A device for applying a fixing medium to electronic chip type components, comprising a trough in which is arranged a row of stamps which are displaceable in vertical directions, each of these stamps consisting of a stamp pin which is identical for all stamps and on which is mounted an exchangeable attachment with a stamp head adapted to a particular one of the components. The trough is closed at the upper side by a cover plate which is provided with holes and on which exchangeable supporting plates are mounted which are displaceable by means of magnets, each support ing plate having several apertures each adapted to a particlar one of the components. The cover plate and the supporting plates are provided with guides and with positioning means for positioning the supporting plates with respect to the stamps.
