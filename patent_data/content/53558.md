# Vacuum actuator for idle operation control.

## Abstract
A vacuum actuator for controlling the idle position of the throttle lever in a vehicle engine, comprising within a housing a control diaphragm 18 and an actuating dia phragm 20 defining three chambers therein 22, 26, 24 the first two of which are connected to vacuum and the third one to atmosphere, a controlled passage 74 between the second and third chambers, and an output plunger 62 connected to the actuating diaphragm for being positioned thereby in an actuating range as a function of the level of vacuum communicated to the actuator. The invention provides for means 38, 40 for with drawing the plunger from its actuating range to a fully retracted position when vacuum is no longer available. For use in automotive vehicles.
