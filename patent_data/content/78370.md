# Method of detecting residual glass during fabrication of ceramic substrates for semiconductors.

## Abstract
To detect residual glass, such as appears at semicon ductor chip pads and via holes during the fabrication of alumina glass ceramic substrates that are used as supports for the semiconductor devices, the glass used for forming the ceramic substrates is doped with a rare earth oxide. During the manufacturing process, the ceramic structures are irradiated after firing with radiation of wavelengths in the range 350 500 nm to induce the glass to fluoresce, thereby revealing the residual glass on the surface of the metallic interconnector pads. If residual glass is present, the parts are reworked, or scrapped if necessary.
