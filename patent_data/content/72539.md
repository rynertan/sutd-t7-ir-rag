# Hydraulic circuit of hydraulic power shovel.

## Abstract
A hydraulic circuit for a hydraulic power shovel of the type having a swingable boom 3 , swingable arm 4 and a bucket 15 attached to the end of the arm 4 . The hydraulic circuit includes a levelling cylinder 9 adapted to extend and contract in response to the swinging of the arm 4 , and a switching valve device 22, 22A, 22B movable between a first position n where it provides a communication between the levelling cylinder 9 and a boom cylinder 6 and a second position m where it provides a communication between the levelling cylinder 9 and an arm cylinder 7 . When the switching valve device 22 takes the first position n , the levelling cylinder 9 is communicated with the boom cylinder 6 so that the boom is swung downwardly in response to the upward swinging of the arm, thereby to move the bucket 5 horizontally. On the other hand, when the switching valve device 22 takes the second position m , the levelling cylinder 9 and the boom cylinder 6 are disconnected hydraulically so that the arm is allowed to swing independently of the boom.
