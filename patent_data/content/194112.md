Novak in DRUG DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH 1982 The test screening procedure relied on to indicate positive antianxiety response is a modification of the Vogel Conflict Test which is based on shock suppressed drinking behavior in rats outlined by J. R. Vogel, et al in PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY Prior to dosing, rats are housed 2 per cage and deprived of water for 48 hr and thereafter randomized into treatment groups of five. Feed is available Anticonvulsant activity was determined for compounds of Formula I as evidenced by using chemsical or electrical challenge as follows. Groups of 8 adult female mice were randomly assigned to dosage groups according to the method of Steel, R.G.D., and Torrie, J.H. 1960 in Principles and Procedures of Statistics , McGraw Hill Book Company, Inc., pp 99 100, pp 428 31. Each mouse was identified with a color code on its tail. The test compounds were administered as solutions or suspensions in 10 ml kg mouse body weight of 0.5 aqueous methyl cellulose within 15 minutes of preparation of the suspension. Metrazole pentylenetetrazol was prepared as a solution in physiological saline. The mice were not fasted prior to the test. Eight mice were tested at each dosage level. Each mouse received one dose of the test drug usually 100 mg kg for screening in the 0.5 aqueous methylcellulose or the control article 0.5 aqueous methylcellulose alone intraperitoneally. Metrazole 80 mg kg S.C. was then given in a loose fold of skin on the back of the neck i.e., 1 2 hr after the test compound or control article was given. Injections were given with a 1 ml glass tuberculin syringe with appropriate size hypodermic needle 27 gauge for solutions 23 gauge for suspensions . All injections were given in a volume of 10 ml kg mouse body weight. Each mouse was observed for 30 minutes following Metrazol injection. Failure of the animals to exhibit a threshold seizure a single episode of clonic spasms at least 5 seconds in duration was defined as protection. Anticonvulsant data were tabulated as the percent protection, i.e, Adult female mice in groups of eight were administered the test drug intraperitoneally usually 100 mg kg initially for screening in liquid carrier, usually physiological saline or water.

The absence of tonic seizures upon cessation of the stimuli was scored as protection in that animal. The number of animals protected from tonic seizures at a given dose of test drug was determined. The ED₅₀, 95 confidence limits and potency ratio may be ascertained by the method of J. T. Litchfield and F. Wilcoxon 1949 J. PHARMACOL. EXP. THER. Some of the more active compounds such as in Examples 7, 8, 10, 14, 16 and 20 exhibit ED₅₀ s in the metrazole test of 5 to 30 mg kg and ED₅₀ s in the electrical challenge test of about 10 to 30 mg kg. The methods of treating anxiety, muscle tension, and spasticity in mammals is best carried out by administering as active ingredients in a pharmaceutical composition at least one of the compounds of Formula I in association with a pharmaceutical carrier or excipient. The compounds are thus presented in a therapeutic composition suitable for oral, rectal, parenteral, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, or intravenous administration. Thus, for example, the composition for oral administration can take the form of elixirs, capsules, tablets, or coated tablets containing carriers conveniently used in the pharmaceutical art. Suitable tableting excipients include lactose, potato, and maize starches, talc, gelatin, stearic and silicic acids, magnesium stearate and polyvinyl pyrrolidone. For parenteral administration, the carrier can be comprised of a sterile parenterally acceptable liquid e.g., water or arachis oil contained in ampoules. In compositions for rectal administration, the carrier can be comprised of a suppository base, e.g., cocoa butter or glyveride. Advantageously, the compositions are formulated as dosage units, each unit being adapted to supply a fixed dose of active ingredients. Tablets, coated tablets, capsules, ampoules and suppositories are examples of preferred dosage forms according to the invention. It is only necessary that the active ingredient constitute an effective amount i.e., such that a suitable effective dosage will be consistent with the dosage form employed. The exact individual dosages as well as daily dosages will, of course, be determined according to standard medical principles under the direction of a physician or veterinarian. Testing suggests that compounds of Formula I will be effective in man for muscle relaxant effects at about 4 40 mg kg body weight per day. Illustratively, one compound, namely, N methyl 3 3 trifluoromethyl phenoxy 1 azetidine carboxamide Example 41 , was found to be about 5 times as potent as Methocarbamol as a muscle relaxant. The suggested regimen, for example, for the compound of Example 41 as a muscle relaxant appears to be about 10 mg kg day or for a 75 kg individual about a unit dosage of 250 mg, t.i.d. Effective daily dosages of compounds of Formual I as antianxiety agents are projected to be about 1 10 mg kg day body weight based on animal data. The anticonvulsant antiepileptic 3 phenoxy 1 azetidine carboxamides of this invention are effective in the treatment of both petit mal epilepsy and grand mal epilepsy. Effective quantities of these compounds may be administered to a living animal body orally as in capsules, tablets or elixirs. It is only necessary that the active ingredient constitute an effective amount, i.e., such that a suitable effective dosage will be obtained consistent with the dosage form employed. The exact individual dosage as well as daily dosages will, of course, be determined according to standard medical principles under the direction of a physician or veterinarian. Based upon a comparison with known anticonvulsant compounds, daily dosages appear to preferably range from about 0.5 to 1.5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight in the treatment of petit mal epilepsy and about 25 to 35 milligrams per kilogram of body weight in the treatment of grand mal epilepsy. Very small quantities of the active materials of the present invention, even as low as 0.1 milligram, are effective when minor therapy is involved. Unit dosages are usually 5 milligrams or above and prefer ably 25, 50 or 100 milligrams per unit dose. The active ingredients of the invention may be combined with other pharmacologically active agents as previously indicated, or with buffers, antacids or the like, for administration and the proportion of the active agent in the composition may be varied widely. Capsules of 5 mg., 25 mg., and 50 mg. of active ingredient per capsule are prepared with higher amounts of ingredient reduction may be made in the amount of lactose. Uniformly blend the selected active ingredient with lactose, starch and magnesium stearate and encapsulate the blend. Additional capsule formulations preferably contain a higher does of active ingredient and are as follows A typical formulation for a tablet containing 5.0 mg. of active ingredient per tablet follows. The formulation may be used for other strengths of active ingredient by adjustment of weight of dicalcium phosphate. Uniformly blend 1, 2, 4 and 5. Prepare 3 as a 10 percent paste in water. Granulate the blend with the starch paste and pass the wet mass through a number eight mesh screen. The wet granulation is dried and passed through a number twelve mesh screen. The dried granules are blended with calcium stearate and compressed. Additional tablet formulations preferably contain a higher dosage of the active ingredient and are as follows. Uniformly blend the active ingredient, lactose, and corn starch. The blend is granulated, using water as a granulating medium. The wet granules are passed through an eight mesh screen and dried at 140 to 160 F 60 to 71 C overnight. The dried granules are passed through a number ten mesh screen and blended with the proper amount of calcium stearate and this blend is then converted into tablets on a suitable tablet press.
