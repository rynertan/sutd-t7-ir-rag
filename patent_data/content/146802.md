# Hydrosilazane polymers from R3Si 2NH and HSiCl3.

## Abstract
A process is disclosed for preparing R₃ SiNH containing hydrosilazane polymer by contacting and reacting trichloro silane with a disilazane R₃Si ₂NH where R is vinyl, hydrogen, phenyl, or alkyl radicals containing 1 to 3 carbon atoms. These hydrosilazane polymers are useful, when fired at high temperatures, in the formation of silicon nitride and silicon nitride containing ceramic materials.
