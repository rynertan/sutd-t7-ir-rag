# Transaction terminal system.

## Abstract
In a transaction terminal system including a central com puter C and a number of remote intelligent terminals T in intermittent communication with the central computer, the central computer periodically updates local hot card files HC at the terminals from a master hot card file MHCF. Hot card data stored at the central computer includes additional data indicative of the likelihood of a partiular hot card being pre sented in a particular locality such that this additional data can be used to select subsets of hot card data for downloading to individual terminals, the subsets includng data on hot cards deemed most likely to be presented in the locality of each terminal concerned.
