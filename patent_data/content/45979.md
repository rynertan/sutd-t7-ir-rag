# RETROREFLECTORS, ESPECIALLY FOR BEAM SCANNING APPLICATIONS AND BEAM SCANNING APPARATUS INCORPORATING SUCH RETROREFLECTORS

## Abstract
A retroreflector consists of a support surface 12 coated with a layer 11 of small retroreflecting particles such as glass spheres. The support surface comprises a plurality of regularly repeating, like structural elements 13 which are inclined to the overall plane of the retroreflector. The surface elements 13 can be of various shapes and serve to increase the angular range over which retroreflection can occur. The optical characteristics of the proposed retroreflectors can be tailored so that they are eminently suitable for use in certain beam scanning applications such as continuous monitoring of doorways and windows by an optical beam scanning device located at one corner thereof in order to detect, for example, intruders.
