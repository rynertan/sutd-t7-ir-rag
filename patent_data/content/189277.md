# Railway trucks.

## Abstract
A bolster for a railway truck is supported at opposite ends on side frames. The side frames are themselves supported at spaced longitudinal points on wheelsets that are steerable to attain a radial position relative to the curve of a track. The side frames are movable relative to one another to accommodate the steering motion of the wheelsets and a linkage is provided between the bolster and each of the side frames to locate the bolster and distribute the lateral loads between the two side frames. The linkage comprises a pair of struts each mounted at one end to a respective side frame and connected at the other end to a common link. The link is pivotally connected to the underside of the bolster intermediate the two struts.
