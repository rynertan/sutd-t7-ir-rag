# PROCESS FOR THE CROSS LINKING OF POLYMERS

## Abstract
In the cross linking of polymers containing ethylenic unsaturation, especially natural and synthetic rubbers of the isoprene or styrene butadiene series, S acyl derivatives of N substituted thiohydroxylamines, previously known to be useful as accelerators for vulcanisation by sulphur or sulphur donors, can be used themselves as sole vulcanisation agents. The preferred compounds for this purpose are the N dithiocarbamoyl derivatives of amines, amides or imides, e.g. S N ,N dimethylamino N,N dimethyldithiocarbamate, S acetylamino N,N diethyldithiocarbamate or S phthalimido di n butyldithiocarbamate. Typical advantages of the resultant rubbers are better resistance to heat ageing and resistance to compression set when compared with sulphur cured rubbers and greater processing safety than TMTD cured rubbers.
