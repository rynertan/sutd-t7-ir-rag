## Description
The present invention relates to a unique and novel improved nrocess for the manufacture of a substantially gel free neutralized sulfonated elastomeric polymer having both improved physical and rheological properties, by sulfonation of an unsaturated elastomer in a solution of a non reactive solvent, and the neutralization of the sulfonate,groups of the sulfonated elastomer in the cement by the addition of a solution of zinc acetate in a solvent system of methanol or a mixed solvent system of methanol and water, wherein the volume percent of methanol based on the volume of nonreactive solvent is less than 10 volume percent.After the neutralization of sulfonated cement has been completed, stearic acid can be optionally added to the cement, wherein the excess zinc acetate reacts in situ with the stearic acid thereby forming the preferential plasticizer, zinc stearate, for the zinc neutralized sulfonate groups. This improved process allows for complete neutralization of the sulfonate groups and the formation of cements which are easily han died and pumped. The elastomeric polymers of the present invention are derived from elastomers having olefinic unssturation sites wherein the polymer has from 0.1 to 10.0 mole 7e olefinic unsaturation. The unsaturation sites can be in the polymer backbone, pendant therefrom or cyclic except that aromatic polymers are excluded from this des cr ption. In particular, the unsaturated polymers of this present invention include low unsaturated polymers such asButyl rubber or EPDM polymers. The sulfonated polymers of this invention contain less than 5 wt, gel, mcre preferably less than 3, and most preferably less than l as measured by stirring a given weight of polymer in a solvent comprised of 95 volumes toluene 5 volumes methanol at a concentration of 50g liter for 24 hours, allowing the mixture to settle, withdrawing a weighed sample of the supernatant solution and evaporating to drvness. In the practice of this invention, the molecular weight of the elastomeric polymer and the concentration of the elastomeric polymer in the non reactive sulfonation solvent are very important. In order to have a viable process, the neutralized sulfonated cement at the end of the process must have sufficiently low viscosity so that the cement may be properly handled with pumping operations, cleaning operations, and the like.The major factors which contribute to the viscosity of the final neutralized sulfonated cement are molecular weight of the base elastomeric polymer the concentration of the elastomeric polymer in the non reactive s fonation cement, the relative amount of sulfonate groups in orporated into the elastomeric polymer, the polar solvent used in reducing ionic associations thereby reducing the viscosity of the neutralized cement, and the amount of water in the cement. In order to have an economical process, it is necessary to sulfonate elastomeric polymer cements contain ing at least 50g elastomeric polymer per liter of nonreactive solvent. This situation occurs because in a commercial manufacturing process, solvents must be recovered and recycled. The more solvent recycled per unit elastomeric polymer product, the more expensive the product. In the present invention, the preferred elastomeric polymer concentration in non reactive solvent is at least 50g liter. In addition, it is necessary that the elastomeric polymer cements be low in viscosity. Sulfonation of the polymer cement does not result in substantial viscosity increases however, neutralization results in very large solution viscosity increases, or in the extreme gel, due to the ionic associations. Therefore, it is important to keep the starting cement viscosities low by using polymer concentrations as low as economically feasible. However, high polymer concentrations are still possible if the molecular weights or Mooney viscosities are low. It is important therefore in the practice of this invention to use elastomeric polymers with as low Mooney viscosities as possible. It has been found that neutralized sulfonated polymers possess good physical properties even if theMooney viscosity ML, 1 8, 2120 F of the starting polymer is 5. On the other hand, at the high Mooney viscosities when cements containing 50g polymer liter solvent are sulfonated and neutralized extremely high final cement viscosities are obtained. The process of this invention can be practised when the elastomeric polymer cement at a concentration of 50g polymer liter of non reactive solvent possesses at 25 C a Brookfield viscosity at 0.6 rpm of 2500 centipoise cps or less. The Mooney viscosity CML, 1 8, 2120F of tn elastomeric polymer is preferably 5 to 60, more prefer truly 10 to 50, and most preferably 15 to 25. The expression Butyl rubber as employed in the specification and claims is intended to include copolymers made from a polymerization reaction mixture having therein from 70 to 99.57. by weight of an isoolefin which has 4 to 7 carbon atoms, e.g. isobutylene and 0.5 to 30 by weight of a conjugated multiolefin having from 4 to 14 carbon atoms, e.g.. isoprene. The resulting copolymer contains 8 5 to 99.8 by weight of combined isoolefin and 0.2 to 15 of combined multiolefin. The preparation ofButyl rubber is described in U.S. Patent 2,356,12 For the purposes of this invention, the Butyl rubber may have incorporated therein from 0.2 to 10 of combined multiolefin preferably 0.5 to 6 more preferably 1 to 4Th, e.g. . Illustrative of such a Butyl rubber is Exxon Butyl 365 Exxon Chemical Co. , having a mole unsaturation of 2.0 and a Mooney viscosity ML, 1 8, 212 F of 45. Very low molecular weight Butyl rubbers, i.e. Butyl rubbers having a viscosity average molecular weight of 5,000 to 85,000 and mole unsaturation of 3 to 4 may be sulfonated. Pref.rNbly, these polymers have viscosity average molecular weight of 25,000 60,000. The term EPDM is used in the sense of its defi nition as found in ASTM D 1418 64 and is intended to mean a terpolynre containing ethylene and propylene in the back bone and unsaturation in a side chain. Illustrative methods for producing these terpolymers are found in U.S. Patent 3,280,082, British Patent 1,030,289 and French Patent 1,386,600. The preferred terpolymers contain 45 to 75 wt. ethylene and 1 to 10 wt. of a diene monomer, the balance of the polymer being propylene. Preferably, the polymer contains 45 to 70 wt. ethylene, e.g. 50 wt. O and 2.6 to 8.0 wt. diene monomer, e.g. 5.0 wt. . The diene monomer is preferably a non conjugated diene. Illustrative of these non conjugated diene monomers which may be used in the EPDM terpolymer EPDM are 1,4 hexadiene, dicyclopentadiene, 5 ethylidene 2 norbornene, 5 methylene 2 norbornene, 5 propenyl 2 norbornene and methyl tetrahydroindene. A typical EPDM is Vistalon 2504 Exxon Chemical Co. a terpolymer having a Mooney viscosity LIL, 1 8, 2120F of 40 and having 50 wt. of ethylene, 45 wt. Z of propylene, and 5.0 wt. of 5ethylidene 2 norbornene with an Mn of 47,000, an Mv of 145,000 and an Mw of 174,000. Another EPDM terpolymer, Vistalon 2504 20 is derived from Vistalon 2504 Exxon Chemical Co. by a controlled extrusion process, wherein the resultant Mooney viscosity at 2120F is 20. The Mn of Vistalon 2504 20 is 26,000, the Mv is 90,000 and the Mw ii 125,000. Nordel 1320 DuPont is another EPDM terpolymer having a Mooney viscosity at 212 F of 25 and having 53 wt. of ethylene, 3.5 wt. of 1,4 hexadiene and 43.5 wt. of propylene. The olefin ically unsaturated polymer is dissolved in a suitable nonreactive solvent t a concentration level of 2 to 25 wt. 7., more preferably at 5 to 20 and most preferably at 10 to 15.Suitable solvents for sulfonation are selected from chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbors such as l,2 d chloroethane, halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzene, alicyclic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane or aliphatic hydrocarbons having 4 to 7 carbon atoms, more preferably 5 to 6, such as isomeric pentanes and hexanes and mixtures thereof. In terms of an economical process halogenated solvents are less preferred as well as solvents boiling above 80 C. Preferred solvents are hydrocarbons boiling at or below 80 C such as hexane and cyclohexane.The most preferred solvents are the saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons containing from 4 to 6 carbon atoms and mixtures thereof. The olefinically unsaturated polymer dissolved in the solvent is sulfonated with a sulfonating agent selected from an acpl sulfate, or a sulfur trioxide donor complexed with a Lewis base containing oxygen, sulfur or phosphorus The term sulfur trioxide donor as used in the specSficavion means a compound containing available sulfur trioxide. Illustrative of such sulfur trioxide donors are SO3, chiorosulfonic acid, and fluorosulfonic acid.The term complexing agent as used in the s ecification means a Lewis base, wherein Lewis base is an electron pair conor. Illustrative of Lewis bases suitable for use as complexing agents are certain phosphorus compounds. While the phosphorus compound may be either inorganic or organic, it is preferred that the phosphorus compound be an organic compound. Various organic phosphites, phosphinites, phosphinates, phosphates, phosphonates, phosphonites and phosphines may be used as the complexing agent. The organic substituents consist of C1 to Cl alkyl, aryl, alkaryl, or aralkyl groups. The nitrogen containing Lewis bases form highly stable complexes with sulfur trioxide donors and are not considered suitable for sulfonation of the unsaturated polymers of this invention. Other Lewis bases suitable as complexing agents are those Lewis bases which contain oxygen or sulfur. Ethers and thioethers have been found useful for complexing sulfur trioxide donor to moderate reaction with the unsaturation of polymer molecules. The ethers and .thioethers may contain one, two or more ether oxygens or sulfurs and may be linear or cyclic. Illustrative of suitable ether Lewis bases are tetrahydrofuran. p dioxane, 2, 3 dichloro 1, 4 diozane, m dioxane, 2, 4 dimethyl 1, 3 dioxane, 2 phenyl 1, 3 dioxane, diethyl ether trioxane, and bis 2 chloroethyl ether. The preferred oxygen contain ins bases are p dioxane, tetrahydrofuran and bis 2 chloroethyl ether. Illustrative of the thioethers are diethyl sulfide and tetrahydrothiophene. Other oxygen containing Lewis bases suitable as complexing agents are carboxylic acid esters wherein the carboxylic acid is a C1 to C10 aliphatic acid, benzoic acid, or phenylacetic acid. Illustrative of such esters are benzyl acetate, butyl acetate, butyl propionate, methyl benzoate, p nitrophenyl acetate, ethyl n butyrate, ethyl stearate, and ethyl phenyl acetate. The molar rstio of SO3 donor to complexing agent may be as high as 15 tO 1 preferably less than about 9 L more preferably. about 4 1 to about 1 1, e.g. 2 1. The preferred solvents for preparation of the complexes of sulfur trioxide donor with complexing agents containing oxygen or sulfur are chlorinated hydrocarbons.Illustrative of such chlorinated solvents are carbon tetrachloride, dichloroethane, chloroform, and methylene chloride.The complexes may also be prepared by direct addition of reagents, if precautions are taken to dissipate evolved heat. The reaction of ethereal complexes of SO3 with the unsaturation of polymer chains has been found to be nonquantitative. Therefore, the use of excess complex is required to give the desired level of sulfonation. The preferred sulfonating agents at he acryl sulfates, in particular acetyl sulfate. The sell sulfates which are selected from acetyl, propionyl, butyryl, or beazoyl sulfate, in particular acetyl sulfate The acyl sulfate may be produced by reacting concentrated sulfuric acid with an acid anhydride.For example, acetic anhydride may be reated with sulfuric acid to form acetyl sulfate which may be used to sul fonate the polymers of this invention. If desired, acetic anhydride may be added to a solution of the polymer in a suitable solvent and sulfuric acid subsequently added to form acetyl sulfate in situ. Alternatively, sulfur tri oxide may be reacted with acetic acid to form the acetyl sulfate. The preferred sulfonating agent is acetyl sulfate which can be prepared according to the following equations EMI9.1 Sulfonation of the polymer is conducted at a temperature between 100C and lOOµC, wherein the reaction time is 1 to 60 minutes, more preferably 5 to 45 minutes and most preferably 15 to 30 minutes. The sulfonation of less substituted olefinic structures, such as those derived from 1,4 hexadiene terpolymers requires somewhat higher temperatures, e.g. 500C when unsaturation levels are low, e.g. less than 2 mole Z. More highly substituted olefinic structures, such as that derived from 5 ethylidene 2 norbornene, are rapidly sulfonated at room temperature and below even at low levels of unsaturation.The product remains soluble throughout the reaction. It should be pointed out that neither the sulfonating agent nor the manner of sulfonation is critical, provided that the sulfonating method does not degrade or cross link the polymer backbone. The amount of desirable sulfonation depends on the particular application. The elastomeric polymer is sulfonated at 10 to 50 meq. sulfonate groups 100 grams of polymer, preferably at about 15 to 50 meq. sulfonate group 100 grams of polymer and more preferably at 20 to 40 meq. sulfonate group 100 grams of polymer. The meq. of sulfonate group 100 grams of polymer is determined by dissolving the sulfonated polymer in a mixed solvent of 95 ports of toluene and 5 parts of methanol at a concentration bezel of 50 grams per liter of solvent. The sulfonated polymer is titrated with sodium hydroxide in ethanol to an Alizarin Thymolphthalein end point. Sulfonate levels can also be determined from sulfur content which is obtained by DietertAnalysis. Polymers containing unsaturation and sulfonate groups have been found to be somewhat deficient in thermostability. Therefore, it is necessary to neutralize a substantial portion of the sulfonate groups as part of the proj cess for the manufacture of the sulfonated elastomeric poly4ssr. Neutralization further improves the physical properties of the sulfonated polymer. In preparing the ionomer it is desirable to neutralize essentially every sulfonate group. In the present invention, neutralizing agent is added in sufficiert excess to ensure the netralization of all the sulfonate groups. When the molecular weight of the elastomeric polymer or the concentration of the elastomericfpolymer in the non reactive solvent is too high or when the sulfonate content of the elastomeric polymer is high, gelation can occur due to the ionic interactions between the sulfonate groups during sulfonation or between the metal sulfon ate.groups after neutralization. The ionic associations of the sulfonate groups are dissipated by ionic group plasticizers such as polar hydrocarbons. Neutralization of the sulfuric acid groups can be effected through zinc salts of carboxylic acids having about 1 to about 4 carbon atoms, in particular zinc acetate dissolved in water. However, extremely high cement viscosities or gels can develop due to the effects of the water added during neutralization thereby producing neutralized sulfonated elastomeric cements which cannot be stirred, pumped, poured or otherwise easily handled. Since it is necessary to convert the unneutralized sulfonate group to the zinc sulfon ate, it is necessary that these neutralizing agents be soluble in a solvent, even if that solvent is not miscible with the sulfonation cement. A large class of possible metal neutralizing agents which might be suitable for this invention are not sufficiently soluble in any organic type solvent.The only effective, available, inexpensive and easy to handle solvent is water. As a consequence, the problem of high viscosity or gelation during the neutralization of sulfonation cements can only be overcome by lowering the amount of water present in the neutralization system. The only effective manner in which this can be done is to choose a neutralization agent such as zinc acetate which has a sufficiently high degree of solubility in a polar organic solvent such as methanol. If the sulfonation cement at the end of the sulfonation is neutralized with an aqueous solution of the zinc acetate in the absence of a polar solvent severe gela tion occurs. This gelation is not due to covalent crosslinking but due to the ionic associations between the metal sulfonated groups. This gelation can be eliminated by using a solution of the zinc acetate dissolved in methanol however, in order to have an economical procass, it is necessary to keep the methanol concentration below 10 volume 7. of the non reactive solvent, more preferably less than 8 volume , and most preferably less than 5 volume .When the methanol concentration is below 5 volume it is preferred not to recycle the methanol but to discharge the methanol into a biological pond for disintegration of the methanol. When higher levels of zinc acetate are required as a neutralizing agent, it is not possible to fully dissolve the required amount of zinc acetate in pure methanol, wherein the methanol level is maintained at a concentration of less than 10 volume Z of the non reactive solvent and even becomes mote difficult in the most preferred embodiment wherein the volume of methanol is less than 5. The minimum volume of methanol based on the volume of non reactive solvent is at least 2, more preferably 2.5 and most preferably 3.When water is employed, the volume Z of water in the mixed solvent of water and methanol is less than 25 more preferably less than 20 and most preferably less than 15.The concentration of zinc acetate dihydrate agent in the solvent system which can be either methanol alone or a mix ture of water and methanol system, is 5 to 35 grams per 100 ml. of solvent more preferably 10 to 30 and most preferably 15 to 25. At the higher methanol concentrations, the neu tralized cement viscosities are the lowest and the most desirable however, it is desirable to keep the methanol concentrations low in order to prevent polymer precipitation and to facilitate the separation of solvent from methanol after the solvent is evaporated from the polymer in the steam stripping operation. The amount of water is kept at a minimum and is generally dictated not only by the solubility of the neutralizing agent but also the concentration of the base polymer, the concentration of the sulfonic acid groups, and the desired ratio of metal ion to sulfonic acid groups in the neutralized cement. Water concentration of 3.5 volume Z or less based on the volume of the non reactive solvent, more preferably less than 2.5 volume Z and preferably less than 1.5 volume is effective in producing cements with sufficiently low viscosities. The viscosities of the neutralized cements are considered processable, when the room temperature Brookfield viscosities do not exceed 50,000 centipoise cps at 0.6 rpm, preferably less than 20,000 cps and most preferably 1000 to 10,000 cDs. It should be apparent to those skilled in the art that those neutralized cements having viscosities of 20,000 to 50,000 cps are not as readily processed at ambient temperatures. It is usually observed, however, that increasing the temperature of the cement by 10 to 25 C above room temperature is effective in lowering the cement viscosity to a more desirable lower range below 50,000 cps. There fore, it is within the spirit of this invention to include those cements whose viscosities at room temperature are above 50,000 cps but which can be further lowered to some extent by increasing the temperature of said cements. To the neutralized cement of the sulfonated elastomeric polymer can optionally be added a linear, saturated or ganicacid having 10 to 40 carbon atoms, more preferably 12 to 26 carbon atoms, and most preferably 14 to 20 carbon atoms.The most preferred acid is stearic acid, wherein the fatty acid reacts with excess zinc carboxylate to form the zinc salt of the fatty acid which is a preferential plasticizer for the zinc neutralized sulfonate groups of the sulfonated elastomeric polymer. Sufficient organic acid is added to form less than about 35 parts per hundred by weight of the zinc salt of the organic acid based on 100 parts of the neutralized sulfonated elastomeric polymer more preferably less than 30 and most preferably 8 to 30. The order of addition of the zinc acetate dissolved in the solvent system and the stearic acid is critical. If stearic acid is first added to the sulfonated cement prior to the addition of the zinc acetate in the solvent system, the stearic acid reacts with the methanol to form methyl stearate. The formation of methyl stearate has an adverse effect on both the tensile properties and the rheological properties. The formation of methyl stearate can be elimi nated and the formation of zinc stearate can be maximized by practicing the teachings of the invention, that is, by first adding the zinc acetate to the sulfonated cement followed by the subsequent addition of the stearic acid thereby forming the preferred preferential plasticizer, zinc stearate, in situ. The metal neutralized sulfonated elastomeric polymer prepared according to this present invention, can be isolated as a crumb by steam stripping. No surface active agents are needed to prepare the easy handling crumb. The crumb that is obtained is easily washed to remove water soluble impurities such as acetic acid and methanol and is suitable to be fed into a dewatering extruder or to be dried in a fluid bed dryer. The resultant zinc neutralized sulfonated elastomeric polymers have higher incorporation Levels of zinc, namely 80 9C7. as compared to the incorporation levels of 55 707., if isopropanol was employed in place of the methanol.This is due to the more facile formation of the zinc stearate from zinc acetate and stearic acid in methanol as compared to isopropanol. The zinc stearate formation in isopropanol is both slow and low in yield whereas in methanol its formation is fast and high in yield. Consequently, less zinc acetate must be used in the methanol process. The physical properties such U tensile strength and compression set are uniformly high for the zinc neutraliged sulfonated elastomeric polymer prepared according to the methanol process as compared to an isopropanol process. This enhancement in physical properties is theorized to be probably attributable to the formation of high concentrations of zinc stearate in situ and consequently lower concentrations of stearic acid, when one employs the methanol process. The higher conversion of stearic acid to zinc stearate wnen methanol is used permits the use of lower quantities of zinc acetate which further permits the use of less methanol, thereby making the process more economical, or less water, thereby producing cements which are lower in viscosity and more readily processable. The improved process of the present invention can be more readily appreciated by reference to the following figure, exampies, and tables.EXAMPLE 1 The solubility characteristics of zinc acetate dihydrate in methanol water mixtures were determined. Ten grams ofZn 00CCH3 2.2H2O was placed into an Erlenmeyer flask and a given amount of methanol was added. The contents were stirred with a magnetic stirring bar. When solution did not occur water was added incrementally until solution occurred. The solubility of zinc acetate dihydrate is illustrated in the Figure where the relative amounts of methanol and water required to dissolve 1.0 gram of the salt are plotted against each other.The solbflity of zinc acetate dihydrate in methanol on the one hand and water on the other is substantially different. However, as theFigure shows a relatively small amount of water greatly enhances the solubility of zinc acetate dihydrate in methanol. Almost 15.5 ml. of pure methanol is required to dissolve 1.0g of the salt whereas only about 4.0 ml. of methanol is required when an additional 0.3 ml. of water is used. The ability of small amounts of water to markedly enhance the solubility of zinc acetate in methanol thereby provides for an economical manufacturing process for zinc sulfonate containing EPDM. It is necessary that the zinc acetate neutralizing agent be added as a solution in order to effect neutralization and in most instances the zinc acetate required for this neutralization and for other purposes is not soluble in a sufficiently small amount of methanol to be economical. In addition a large amount of methanol will render the polymer insoluble by virtue of its incompatability with the hydrocarbon backbone rather than through any changes in ionic association.The zinc acetate requirenents for neutralization of 100 grms of sulfonated polymer in L000 ml. non reactive solvent for practically all of the desirable gum compositions covers a range of zinc acetate levels requiring from about 100 ml. to about 250 ml. methanol, or from about 10 to about 25 volume Z methanol based on non reactive solvent. These levels of methanol increase the cost of the manufacturing process and can result in polymer precipitation. Consequently, these higher alcohol levels are undesirable. Rey are readily avoided through the use of small amounts of water. EXAMPLE 2 Vistalon 2504 Exxon Chemical Co. was decreased 4 in molecular weight through a hot extrusion process from its original Mooney viscosity ML, 1 8, 212 F of about 40 to a Mooney viscosity of about 20. Vistalon 2504 nor ntains about 30 wt. Z ethylene, about 45 wt. propylene and out 5 wt. 5 ethylidene 2 norbornene. In 5000 ml. of hexane was dissolved 500g of the 20 Mooney EPDM. To the cement was added 28.7 ml. of acetic anhydride 304 mmoles followed by 10.5 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid 187.5 mmoIes . After 30 minutes the sulfonated cement was neutralized and simultaneously deactivated through the addition of a solution of 33.0g zinc acetate dihydrate 300 meq. in 250 ml. methanol and 10 ml. water.The methanol was 5 volume Z on hexane, and the water was 0.2 volume on hexane. The Brookfield viscosity of the result ant cement was then obtained at room temperature over a range of shear rates. Viscosity data are given in Table I. The resultant cement was low in viscosity and could easily be stirred, poured, or pumped.

Effective plasticizers are stearic acid and zinc stearate.Stearic acid can be added to the cement during the process of neutralization and either some of it or all of it can be converted to the more desirable zinc stearate through the proper control of zinc acetate concentration as well as the process conditions. This series of runs will demonstrate that it is possible for undesirable methyl stearate to form under certain process conditions. In order to determine how extensive the methyl stearate formation was the effect of reaction time was studied. The 20 Mooney V 2504 lOOg described in Example 2 was dissolved in 1000 ml. hexane and sulfonated with 5.74 ml. of acetic anhydride and 2.10 ml. concentrated sulfuric acid 37.5 mmoles . Samples for sulfur analysis were taken, and the polymeric sulfonic acid was isolated by steam stripping and drying on a rubber mill. The sulfonation mixture was inactivated with 30 ml. methanol. Then 25.6g 90 moles of stearic acid was added. In four separate runs A D,Table II the reaction mixture was stirred for 15, 30, 60, and 120 minutes. The cements were then neutralized with a solution of 9.88g 90 meq. of zinc acetate dihydrate in 50 ml. methanol and 2 ml. water.After stirring 30 minutes 0.5g of Antioxidant 2246 was added, and the resultant plasticized and neutralized sulfonated EPDM was isolated through steam stripping and drying the wet polymer on a rubber mill at about 2000F. Data on these four runs is given in Table II. Infra red spectra on thin films of the above polymers were obtained. After only 15 minutes stearic acid contact time A a substantial amount of methyl stearate carbonyl band at about 1745 om l had already formed. After 60 minutes C hardly any stearic acid was present, and after 120 minutes D virtually none was present but the methyl stearate content was substantial. Two more sulfonations were made E F, Table II as described above. However, in these two instances macti vat ion and neutralization were effected simuLtaneously after 30 minutes of sulfonation. Stearic acid 90 mmoles was added along with 0.5g Antioxidant 2246, and the resultant cements were stirred for 30 minutes E and for 24 hours F . The polymers were isolated as described above. Data on these runs also are given in Table II. Infra red examination of these two samples showed only trace quantities of methyl stearate even after 24 hours of stirring. These runs show that no esterification is occurring after neutralization. This means that not only is methyl stearate not forming but also that methyl acetate is not forming. It is important in a successful process to avoid the formation of such by products which might interfere with product performance and which could increase the complexity and the cost of the manufacturing process.

After 30 minutes of sulfonation the cement was inactivated and neutralized with a solution of zinc acetate dihydrate in the mixtures of methanol and water shown in Table III. Samples for sulfur analysis were withdrawn just prior to neutralization. After 5 minutes 90 moles of stearic acid was added along with 0.5 gAntioxidant 2246, and the cement was stirred for 30 minutes.The product was then isolated immediately by steam stripping and the polymer was water washed in a Waring blender. The resultant wet crumb was dried on a two roll mill at about 2200F. Brookfield viscosities of the final cements were determined at room temperature over a range of shear rates.Viscosities are given in Table III. These data clearly show the dramatic effects of methanol and water concentrstion upon cement viscosity. At a level of 4 volume X methanol on hexane only about 1 volume 2 water produced a viscosity of greater than 37,000 cps at 0.6 rpm. Thus at very low levels of methanol it is critical to keep the water level very low in order to obtain cement viscosities which are low enough for the cements to be easily processed.Increasing the amount of methanol decreases the cement viscosity and allows more water to be used, if desired. It is, of course, most desirable to keep the methanol concentration low. However, in order to dissolve the zinc acetate dihydrate at low methanol levels it is necessary to use some water Ao dissolve the zinc acetate.The use of too much water and too little methanol results in cement viscosities which are too high. Suitable balances can be obtained which give low cement viscosities, complete zinc acetate solubilities, and low methanol concentrations. The sulfur and zine contents of the fourteen gums are given in Table IV. Within experimental error the sulfur contents and zinc contents were identical and did not change with changing concentrations of methanol and water used in the process. Melt viscosities of selected gums were obtained with an Instron capillary rheometer at 200 C and over a range of shear rates. Apparent viscosities for three shear rates are given in Table IV as well as the shear rate at which melt fracture occurred. Again within experimental error the gums produced possessed identical properties.Thus over the range of methanol and water levels studied product compositions and product properties were identical.

It markedly improves melt flow however, tensile properties, especially those at somewhat elevated temperatures, deteriorate or are not improved. Zinc stearate on the other hand exerts about the same effect on melt flow than does stearic acid however, zinc stearate rather remarkably improves tensile properties at both room temperature and at 70eC. Virtually all formulations derived from zinc sulfonate EPDM do require some sort of an ionic plasticizer, and zinc stearate is the plasticizer of choice. It is possible to prepare the unplasticized gum and post add the zinc stearate but the unplasticized gum has a high viscosity and it is difficult to mix. Also the wet crumb of unplasticized gum after manufacture and isolation cannot be dried by such commonly used techniques as extrusion dewatering. It is desirable to have zinc stearate in the gum prior to isolation, drying and compounding. Of course, zinc stearate can be added to the neutralized cement prior to isolation. This requires a dispersion step. In addition zinc stearate is costly. It is possible to more economically generate zinc stearate during the neutralization step through the addition of stearic acid and a sufficient excess of zinc acetate neutralizing agent. Thus through the simple adiustment of zinc acetate concentration it is possible to prepare zinc stearate plasticized gums which possess sufficiently low melt viscosity for ease of compounding and exceptional physical properties. In a copending application DocketC 467 a process for the preparation of metal sulfonate containing EPDM s is described wherein isopropanol is used as a polar cosolvent. It has been found that surprisingly the use of methanol as a cosolvent improves both the rate of formation and the yield of zinc stearate over isopropanol.In a practical sense this means that less zinc acetate needs to be used for the combination of neutralization and zinc stearate formation. In terms of the process wherein methanol is used this means that either less methanol can be used to make the process even more economical or that less water is necessary to dissolve the zinc acetate resulting in lower cement viscosities. In this example two series of runs were made using methanol as a neutralization cosolvent and isopropanol as a neutralization cosolvent. Twelve runs were made in each series wherein both the amount of stearic acid plasticizer and the amount of zinc acetate neutralizing agent were varied.These variations are shown in Table V. All sulfonations were made on lOOg of the 20Mooney Vistalon 2504 described in Example 2 in 1000 ml.hexane with in situ acetyl sulfate generated through the addition of 60.75 moles acetic anhydride followed by 37.5 moles of concentrated sulfuric acid for 30 minutes at room temperature. In the methanol process termination and neutralization were effected simultaneously by adding a solution of zinc acetate i 80 ml. methanol and 3 ml. water. The stearic acid was added along with 0.5g Antioxidant 2246, and the neutralized mixture was stirred for 2 hours before steam stripping and work up. In the isopropanol process the sulfonation was terminated with 150 ml. isopropanol followed by a solution of zinc acetate in 25 ml. water. The stearic acid was added with 0.5g Antioxidant 2246, and the cement was stirred for 2 hours before stripping and work up. After stripping the gums were pulverized with water in a Waring blender, and the resultant crumbs were dewatered and dried on a rubber mill at about 230F. The sulfur and zinc contents were determined and are given in Table V. Infra red spectra on thin films of the gums were obtained The completeness of the conversion of stearic acid to zinc stearate was followed with the stearic acid carbonyl band at 1710 cm l. The infra red spectra showed that about 30 meq. of zinc acetate 100 EPDM less than in the isopropanol process was required in the methanol process to produce an equivalent amount of zinc stearate. This effect was also manifested in the zinc contents of the gums. The zinc contents of the methanol process gums are uniformly higher than those of the isopropanol process. The real significance of the efficient production of zinc stearate is demonstrated in Table VI where the ten sile properties at room temperature and 700C and the melt index of all of the gums are tabulated. The melt indexes of the methanol and isopropanol gums are comparable which is to say that stearic acid and zinc stearate are excellent but equivalent ionic plasticizers. Substantial differences in tensile properties of the methanol gums and the isopropanol gums are obtained. These differences are due simply to the relative amounts of stearic acid present. Zinc stearate markedly enhances tensile properties while stearic acid is deleterious to tensile properties, especially at 700 C.
