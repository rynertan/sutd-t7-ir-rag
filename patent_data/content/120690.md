In playing piano, the player generally will simultaneously play a plurality of keys therefore, the sensing means for each kay should be able to generate and to deliver an output signal simultaneously. The following embodiments will describe how the string percussing signal generator 3 and the ttansmission and processing circuit 4 in this system accomplish the aforesaid requirements. Referring to Fig. 29 there is shown an embodiment of direct transmission, in which the operation of the keys 12 Kl Kn of the primary rendition piano will be sensed respectively with the corresponding string percussing signal generator 3 T1Tn and will be directly, through wire, transmitted to the corresponding stringpercussing hammer driving means 27 HD1 HD . The embodiment shown in Fig. 30 is furnished, in the transmission wire, with a linear amplifier AMPl AMPn. n The aforesaid wire transmission method is this system is just the multi tone and single line scanning type of direct transmission method as shown in Fig. 31, in which the grounding terminals of the string percussing signal generators Tl Tn are connected, in series, with a switching transistor Q1 On respectively the output terminals Tl Tn are connected in parallel and coupled to one amplifier 71 . At the grounding terminal of every string percussing hammer driving means HD1 HDn of the terminal piano, a switching transistor QD1 QDn is also connected in series recpectively.The input terminals of HD1 HD are connected in parallel, n and then coupled to the output terminal of said amplifier 71 . Further, in the string percussing signal transmission and processing circuit 4 a time sequence oscillator 72 and a ring counter 73 are furnished. The output terminals P1 P of said ring counter 73 are connected respectively to the basis of the aforesaid switching transistors Q1 Qn and QD1 QDn in other words, the output point P1 is used for driving Q1 and 9dl P2 is used for driving Q2 and QD2 likewise, Pn is used for driving Qn and QDn so as to have the operation of K1 Kn generate a scanning type n of multi tone output. Fig. 32 is an embodiment of radio transmission in a single tone frequency modulation mode to be used in this system. Referring again to Fig. 1, there is shown an oscaillator in the string percussion signal transmission and processing circuit 4 and the oscillating frequency of said oscillator is to be determined by the resistance value of the resistors R, R which are connected respectively in parallel to every normally closed contact of the switches 5K15Kn coupled to the keys Kl Kn. For example, upon K1 being played, the normally closed contact coupled to K1 will become opening to have the oscillator generate oscillating at a frequency determined by R1.Said oscillating signal and the signal generated by T1 are all coupled into the modulator, and will be transmitted to other place after being amplified. Since the resistor of every key is R1 i R2 for .... 11 Rn the transmitting frequency is different from each other therefore, the various resonant circuits LC in the terminal piano will have a selection to the input signal frequency. Since all the resonant frequencies fLCl fLCn of the resonant circuits LC1 LCn have been pretuned to the same frequencies of said corresponding OSC.of every key, only the LC circuit LCl LCn of the corresponding key Kl Kn being played can generate a resonance and generate an input. The said input signal will pass a detector Dl Dn for detection, and pass an amplifier AMP1 AMPn for amplification so as to drive the corresponding string percussing hammer driving means HD1 HDn to actuate the stringSercussing hammer coupled thereto. Fig. 33 is an embodiment of a multi channel radio transmission method for the remote control rendition system, in which the notes generated by every key may be transmitted simultaneously. The feature of that system is that every key K1 K has its discrete modulator M1 Mn oscillator OSCl OSCn, and amplifier AMP1 AMPn so as to have the signal generated by each key transmitted simultaneously to the terminal piano. Fig. 34 is an embodiment of a scanning type of single channel transmission method, in which the grounding eterminal of every key K1 K as shown in Fig. 33 is connected in series to a switching transistor Ql Qn and then the outputs of all modulators Ml Mn are connected in parallel.The keys K1 Kn and the corresponding switchesS1 Sn are operated simultaneously so as to trigger, upon the key K1 Kn being pushed downwards, the corresponding Ml Mn and OSCl OSCn and to have the string percussing signal passed from the parallel output terminals ot T1 Tn to the pre amplifier, and to the coupled to a modulatorMo together with a RF signal generated by an oscillatorOSCo at a frequency forgo the signal is then amplified and transmitted.In addition, a scanning oscillator at a scanning frequency of f OSC is installed to furnish scanning signal to a ring counter, of which the output terminals P1 Pn are connected respectively to the basis of Q1 Qn. The relationship among the aforesaid frequencies is fOSC1 fOSC2 fOSC3... fOSCn 1 FOSCn and fOSCo fOSC1 fOSCn fOSC fOSC1 fOSCn are the corresponding frequencies of the oscillators OSCl OSCn In addition to adding a resonant circuit LCo a resonant frequency fLCo equal to fOSCo in the front portion of the receiving device to receive the RF of OSLO, a pre amplifier may be added, if necessary, before connecting to the parallel terminal of the resonant circuit LCl LCn that are used for selecting the various input string percussing signals. Owing to the presence of the followng relationship fLCo fOSCo fLC1 fOSC1 fLC2 fOSC2 . . . . . fLCn fOSCn a signal after being pre amplified and passing through the resonant circuit LCl LCn for selecting a key in the terminal piano, and then passing through the detector and amplifier to couple to the sttig percussing hammer driving means will reflect, with its amplitude, the same fingering skill of the player at the primary rendition piano. The relationship among the signals is illustrated in Fig. 35. In the embodiments shown in Fig. 29, to 33, a group of switches S1 SN may, if necessary, be installed in the keys K1 K as shown inFig. 34 so as to turn on the power supply of the detector, the oscillator, the modulator, or the amplifier to generate the functions thereof upon the key being pushed down in order to reduce power consumption. Moreover, in the present invention, the operation of pedal operated manually to generate forte and pianissimo, tremolo, and liaison may also be sensed and converted to a signal by means of electro mechanical or photocell contact or the aroresaid string percussing signal generator,and then said signal will be transmitted to the terminal piano by means of the aforesaid method of transmitting the stringpercussing signal. The driving means to generate the aforesaid functions in the terminal piano may also be selected out of the aforesaid driving means to be used for string percussing means. Upon transmitting and scanning, the said signal may be encoded and processed together with the string percussing signals of the keys, but the driving means in the terminal piano is the conventional mechanism used for converting the aforesaid functions. In brief, the aforesaid signal processing method will enable the said piano having the various novel functions and a group rendition mode which are to be described later. For examole, in Fig. 36, the output signal of thekey on the key board 1 may be used for driving two or more than two terminal pianos 74 simultaneously by means of the various transmission methods illustrated in Fig. 29 to 34 the transmission methods illustrated in Fig. 29 and 30 are indicated with dotted lines in said Fig. 36 . Fig. 37 is a further mode in using the present invention, which includes two sets of key boards and two pianos arranged abreast or two groups of terminal pians 74 each group including more than one terminal piano underneath the keys of each key board, a string percussing signal generator 3 is installed, and eachterminal piano 74 is furnished with the string percussing means 6 . In rendition, the combined forte point generated by the two terminal pianos arranged abreat or two groups of terminal pianos may generate a linear displacement effect. The system shown in Fig. 38 comprises four key boards and four terminal pianos or four groups of termnal pianos 74 arranged ii four comers or a square or rectangular floor. In rendition, the key boards may be applied with different percussing strength so as to have the terminal pianos 74 in four corners generate a combined forte point that can have horizontal and vertical displacement on a coordinate plane so as to obtain a four channel effect. Fig. 39 is a system including eight terminal pianos or eight groups of terminal pianos 74 arranged in the corners of a cubic space so as to receive the renditions from eight key boards not shown . The different percussing force applied ID the keyboards will generate a three dimensional forte point displacement in a given fixed point in said cubic space so as to form a stereo effect. The aforesaid stereo effect not only can be obtained by means of separately, playing said two or more than two sets of keyboards to generate a variable combined forte point, but also can be obtained by playing a single keyboard which is installed with a separate forte point control means to control the string percussng strength of every terminal piano so as to generate a variable displacement of the combined forte point. The aforesaid forte point control means may be operated manually or mechanically so as to have the combined forte point make linear displacement, or two dimensional displacement, or three dimensional displacement e.g.using handle, or pedal, or other type of control means in order to proportionally control the signal transmitted to the variousstring percussing systems or the servostring percussing system and to generate a combined forte point displacement in the various terminal pianos or the terminal servo pianos . The said function may be obtained by means of the control mechanism of the aforesaid control means being coupled to an analog or digital sensing means a differential potentiometer type, or an induction tye or a photocell type as shown in Fig. 3 to generate a corresponding signal upon said control means being operated, and said signal is then coupled into a distribution circuit of string percussing strength which distribute the strength suitably to the string percussing signal coming from the single set of key board. The sensing signal after being distributed will be transmitted to the string percussinE hammer driving means in the terminal pianos so as to generate the notes having different strength corresponding to the strength of signal received in the terminal pianos. Upon the control means of said forte point being continuously operated in various modes, the combined forte point formed by the various fortes and pianissimos of various terminal pianos will generate a linear displacement, two dimensional displacement, or three dimensional displacement. Fig. 40 is a distribution circuit of string percussing strength to control the combined forte point makine linear displacement. In that circuit, the input terminals of the two amplifiers AMPX and AMPS are connected respectively to the output terminals of the differential potentiometer type of position sensing means VRX and VRS The bases of the two transistors QX and QX are controlled respectifely with said AMPX and AMPX , and the collectors of said transistors being connected in parallel are coupled to the parallel output terminals of the string percussing signal for instance, in Fig. 34, said terminals being Ml Mn . In operating the forte point control means 75 the output potential of the potentiometers VRX and VRX will have a synchronous but reverse increase or decrease, i.e. upon the output potential of VRX being increased, the output potential of VRx will simultaneously be decreased, and vice versa. The aforesaid two signal with different potential will be amplified respectively through said two amplifiers before being coupled to the bases of and to control the conduction state of the transistors so as to determine the output distribution ratio of the stringpercussing signal.After being proportionally distributed the string percussing servo signal may still, through the two output terminals of X and X be coupled to the stringpercussing signal transmission and processing circuit 4 so as to be transmitted to the various terminal pianos to control the displacement of the combined forte point.Fig. 41 is a system block diagram which includes two terminal pianos or two groups of terminal pianos arranged abreast, and the aforesaid forte point control means, and the distribution circuit of string percussing strength 46 . Fig. 42 is a distribution circuit of string percussing strength to control the combined forte point to vary within a two dimensional space. Fig. 43 is a system ltck diagram including said distribution circuit of string percussing strength 47 . As to the distribution circuit of string percussing strength for controlling the combined forte point displacement in a three dimensional space, it may be developed by analog as mentioned above. Referring again to Fig. 1, there is shown a monitor 2 for sensing thekey speed and the force applied to the key, and said monitor is in stalled beside the primary rendition piano so as to provide the beginner or pianist with reference. The display of said monitor may be of an analog type or a digital type. In using an analog type, the analog or digital output signal generated by the stringpercussing generator will directly, or through a D A converter be coupled into a memory oscilloscope, which will display the corresponding waveform of the player s finerging skill for reference. In using a digital type, the display means will have the aforesaid data displayed in digits. Having been mentioned above, the string percussing servodriving means 6 in said system can drive the stringpercussing hammer driving means 27 in the terminal piano 74 by using an equivalent analog signal or a series of digital signal corresponding to the volume, the speed and the tonality of the output signal of the key board 1 or discrete key board in the primary rendition piano. The string percussing force and speed in the primary rendition piano can all be dividided specifically before being transmitted into the terminal piano as a servo instruction there fore, the terminal piano in the present invention can not only operate upon receiving the servo instruction transmitted from the primary rendition piano, but also can operate upon receiving the digital instruction from other device, such as recording and playback tape, or computer, etc. As shown in Fig. 1, the primary rendition piano or the terminal piano in the system may also be installed with a register means 8 which may be a recorder tape, a magnetic disk, ROM, RAM, EPROM, an optical, a magnetic or a mechanical type of memory means the registered signal may be transmitted into a terminal piano having the said same opsationX function for retransmitting an instruction to drive the string percussing hammer so as to obtain a completely same rendition result as that of the primary rendition piano. It is particularly good for fidelity when using recorder tape as the register means and using more than two recording Iplayback heads for the four track or eight track recording and playback.The system not only can provide remote control rendition but also can register thepimary rendition contents for simultaneous or later re generating rendition at different place and occasion with the original rendition results. Further, the primary rendition piano and the terminal piano may be provided with an automatic string timing means, which comprises a key number identification circuit of string tuning 48 as a monitor , a LC resonant circuit assembly 49 to be driven with micro sound and being used for selecting the assembly number, a differential amplification and driving circuit 50 and a forward reverse rotation driving motor assembly for tuning in the Fig., only showing a motor 5 for tuning a given string. The tuning theory and the runing opeation are described as follows In it tuning a given string 53 push manually the key corresponding to the string, and the string percussing hammer 7 coupled to said string will actuate a switch 76 which will have an external pulse signal representing said string coupled to the key number identification circuit of string tuning 48 which may be made of a micro computer or other appropriate logic circuit. The identification signal is coupled to the key number identification circuit of string tuning 48 through a sensing means shown in Fig. 3 0 installed in the key to be tuned. Upon receiving said signal, the identification circuit 48 will generate a corresponding signal to turn on the corres ponding LC resonant circuit so as to be driven by the string percussing audio frequency signal of said string 53 through the microphone 52 . The values of L and nC in said resonant circuit should satisfy the resonant requirement under the standard frequency of string, and at the correct msonant frequency the reactane E Xc i.e. VXL VXC Now, the output of said resonant circuit will pass through the two bridge rectifiers Br1 and Br2 and two optoisolators,OPTOl and OPT02 respectively, and then will be coupled to the differential amplification and driving circuit 50 with an equal signal level consequently, the string tuning motor 51 will not operate. In case of the signal of said string 53 tuned being coupled through said microphone 52 being low or too high, variation between the XC and X1 will take place, and the output of the differential amplicication and driving circuit 50 will chaff to cause a given string tuning motor 51 such as an A.C. orD.C. motor, or a small stepper motor to operate in order to drive a speed reducing element to adjust the tension of the steel string until obtaining a correct tune. Further, between the axle end of said motor 51 and the transmission element, a brake means driven with an electro magnetic means may be installed so as to the stability of the system.In the event of not obtaining the correct frequency after the first tuning, continue to play the key related to the key being tuned so as to couple the string tuning signal of said string contiuously until obtaining a correct frequency and the pilot light LED going out. The aforesaid string tuning operation may also be done during the rendition by means of the string percussing signal of the primary rendigion piano or the terminal piano directly coupled to the keynumber identification circuit of string tuning for directly and automatically tuning. In addition to the built in type, said stringtuning means may be a discrete and automatic type as shown in Fig. 45, in which a resonant leaf spring assembly 54 is firmly attached to a resonant chamber as a tuning plate to test the vibrating frequency of every string then, use a manual method or the said stri tuning means to control the string tuning motor 510 to drive a runing sleeve for tuning. At the end of each said resonant leaf spring assembly 54 a resonanceintensifying metal strip may be installed. Each of said resonant leaf springs can generate a frequency same as that of scales of the piano so as to generate mechanical resonance with the various scales for manual tuning reference. The aforesaid tuning plate may be coupled with a photocell or an electro magnetic sensing means so as to sense the amplitude of resonant tuning plate during percussing the string. The sensing signal may be in proportion to the resonant amplitude of said leaf spring. In the transmission signals of this remote control rendition system, a string calibration instruction code may be included, and is to be transmitted to the terminal piano for calibration of the scales by means of said automatic string tuning means to drive the stringtuning motor 51 . The arrangement of the key board 1 in the present invention may be designed into the spaes as shown inFig. 46, 47 and 48 in Fig. 46 and 47 front view , the arrangement shapes of the keys 12 are designed in accordance with the requirements of human engineeing, or are designed into an upward convex or downward concave in accordance with the players conditions. Fig. 48 a top view shows the key board being in a convex shape by using the piano body as a centre. Referring to Fig. 49, there is shown the keys 12 of piano being arranged in a matrix shape, in which the chromatic scales remain at the original position. In the matrix arrangement, the.keys may be arranged in separate rows in accordance with the scale or the key signature so as to facilitate the beginner doing practice. Since the matrix shaped key board has wider cross section, the percussing scope is extended horizontally. Further, said key board may be designed into a slightly slating position towards the players face, or into a slightly convex or concave surface so as to facilitate the payer moving fingers quickly and accurately to the key in horizontal direction. The keys to be used in this system may be designed into a convex shape over the often touched portion as shown in Fig. 50 so as to facilitate the players finger slipping over the keys the keys may also be designed into a concave shape as shown in Fig. 51 so as to facilitate the players finger slipping over the keys with better accuracy. In the said resonant chamber, one or more than one set of constant temperature and humidity means as shown in Fig.52 may be installed. The said constant temperature and humidity means includes an electric heater having temperature setting means so as to control the humidity and an electric fan to circulate the air in the resonant chamber.Said means may also be used in general piano.
