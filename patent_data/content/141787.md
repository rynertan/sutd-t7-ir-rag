# BENCH SYSTEM

## Abstract
A bench system for laboratories, kitchens or offices is disclosed which comprises a plurality of modules 10 which are adapted to be joined together. The modules have an upper frame 17 and a lower 13, 15, 14. The lower frame 13 supports a bench top 12 and the upper frame 17 is provided with horizontal coupling bars 21 which enable an overhead unit such as a cupboard 40 to be attached to the frame 17 via brackets 42. A channel 25 is located above the bench top sections 21 for receiving electrical conduits and the front of the channel 25 is provided with a power point to supply power to the modules. Grommets 50 are interposed between the bench top sections 21 of adjacent modules when the modules are joined together to form a bench to system.
