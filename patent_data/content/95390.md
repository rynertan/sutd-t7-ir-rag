# Safety mounting for side stowable boom extension or jib.

## Abstract
A swing around side stowable jib 23 for crane booms 20 is safely supported at all times during movement from its use position to its stowed position, and vice versa. In the short transitional movement of the jib following its release from its nose assembly 21 pivot 25 and immediately prior to re engaging this pivot 25 , the jib 23 is always securely held by a strongly biased safety latch 50 58 in supportive engagement with a side mounting assembly 26 located between the nose assembly pivot 25 and a second mount ing assembly 27 on the boom rearwardly of the first mounting assembly 26 . The safety latch 50 58 at proper times is easily released by operation of a hand lever 83 near ground level. Locks 113, 85 for the safety latch and its release lever are also provided. The safety latch is swiveled 47, 48 and biased 59 to meet the swing around jib 23, 24 squarely as it approaches the stowed position.
