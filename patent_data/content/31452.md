# Oscillatory semi conductor devices.

## Abstract
Semiconducting material for example p type Ge, p type Si and the like, is formed into a thin foil 10 , a few atoms thick, preferably by depositing the material on an atomically flat 110 plane surface of an insulating semiconductor substrate 12 , for example GaAs, ZnSe and the like. The material used for the foil is from a group characterized by re entrant constant energy level contours and negative effective charge carrier masses. The foil 10 has length and width dimensions much greater than the thickness. An electric bias field is applied across the length of the foil via electrodes 18 tending to shift the charge carrier population into a sector of negative transverse mass. In this manner the resistance across the width of the foil between connectors 14, 15 becomes negative and electric energy is delivered to external circuitry connected at ter minals 28, 29 across the width of the foil. The external circuitry comprises a suitable resonant circuit e.g. an R C circuit. The output can be modulated by means of a radiant energy source 96 driven from source 94 through mod ulator 92 and modulating source 90 . A stacked structure of two or more layers connected in parallel is disclosed for generating larger currents as may be needed for amplifying and oscillating circuits.

## Description
OSCILLATORY SEMI CONDUCTOR DEVICES The invention relates to non linear electric devices exhibiting the characteristic of negative resistance, and it particularly pertains to semiconductor devices and to circuit arrangements for applying electric fields thereto for producing desired negative resistance characteristics. Electric devices and or circuit arrangements operating in modes which exhibit the characteristic of negative resistance are well known.A great many different arrangements have been devised. One class of arrangements for obtaining the effect is that concerned with semiconductor devices in which negative resistance characteristics are developed in the bulk of the semiconductor. Prior Art There are structures and circuit arrangements in the prior art that are of interest with respect to the structure of the invention as will be found in the following U.S. patents 3,204,115 8 1965 Parmenter 307 88.5 3,258,663 6 1966 Weimer 317 235 3,517,336 6 1970 Wymanski 331 107 3,626,257 12 1971 Esaki et al 317 234R 3,626,328 12 1971 Esaki et al 331 107GAnd in the following publications Herbert Kromer Proposed Negative Mass Microwave Amplifier Physical Review Letter to the Editor Vol. 109 No. 5, March 1, 1958 p 1856. Herbert Kromer Physical Principles of a Negative Mass Amplifier Proceedings of the IRE Vol 47, March 1959 pp 397 406. The patent to Parmenter discloses a four terminal semiconductor device exhibiting negative resistance between two terminals in response to control current applied to the other two terminals, and the semiconductor structure is subjected to transverse control current output current flow. However, the device is a superconductive device and comprises three contiguous, bulk structural regions. The patent to Weimer discloses a field effect transistor device.The device comprises a film of high resistivity material, less than 2 microns 200 Angstroms thick on a semi conductor substrate. Source and drain electrodes are connected to the substrate and a control electrode to the film. The patent to Symanski is directed to a semiconductor device for use in oscillator circuitry comprising a thin film stressed by electric potential and the application of photoradiation for spontaneously generating low frequency oscillations. This arrangement necessitates a o thin film of 3000 Angstroms 30 microns in depth of material having photoelectric transducing properties. A film of this thickness is to be contrasted with the very thin film used in performance of theApplicants invention. The remaining patents to Esaki, Ludeke, Webster and Tsu and toEsaki, Ludeke and Tsu are directed to a semiconductor device structure that is applicable to a bulk oscillator circuit. The device comprises a superlattice structure comprising a multiple of pairs of semiconductor layers alternating in sequence interposed in an electric circuit and subjected to an electric field. Output energy is extracted by a cavitytype structure formed transverse to the superlattice structure. The electric current corresponding to the negative resistance product flows at right angles to the plane of the layers, in contradistinction to the device of the invention. The publications to Kromer appear to be the closest teaching to that of the invention. Here the effect was sought with a semiconductor body of substantially three dimensions equally large with respect to the atomic radius of the material. The idea was proposed in 1957 by Herbert Kromer, who noted that at high kinetic energies, electrons and holes in semiconductor devices may exhibit negative effective masses.In an electric field the current contribution from negative mass carriers is opposite to the electric field, and a semiconductor device containing a sufficient number of such carriers will exhibit negative resistance.However, it was recognized that any attempt to accelerate normal carriers up into the negative mass energy range faces a difficulty that opticalphonon scattering and avalanche ionization will, in most cases, prevent the carriers from reaching that range. It was pointed out that the negative masses occur at energies close to the band edge if the energy contours are re entrant there, as is the case, for example, for the heavy holes in germanium. There, the energy contours are re entrant along the six 100 directions. Along these directions then, the transverse effective masses are negative. Accordingly, it was proposed that a microwave amplifier be arranged with a p type Ge crystal with a strong dc bias field applied in the 100 direction with the electric rf field of a resonant cavity or a wave guide arranged perpendicular to it. The bias field could shift the total hole population toward the inside of a conical region of negative transverse mass. If the majority of the holes were brought inside this cone, the rf field would then be amplified. It was noted that in order to make this possible, it is necessary to avoid any scattering of the holes out of the negative mass cone. The sought for results were not obtainable, however, with the reason therefor thought to be the result of germanium having too high a scattering cross section. The objects of the invention referred to indirectly hereinbefore and those that will appear as the specification progresses are attained in a semiconductor device comprising a layer of semiconductive material that is confined to a thickness of but a few atoms of the material.Since the layer is but a few atomic layers or a few particles thick, and in practice is from one to not more than four atoms or molecules thick, it is termed an oligatomic, or particularari foil hereinafter.Because thin film magnetic material is defined as that being 10,000 Angstroms or less in thickness, the layer will be referred to hereinafter as a thin foil since it is less than a few Angstroms thick. The thin foil has length and width dimensions very much greater than that of the depth or thickness, whereby the material approaches a two dimensional plane structure for most practical purposes. As a practical matter, the material is deposited on an insulating semiconductor substrate having at least one substantially flat plane surface. Accordingly the invention provides a semi conductor device capable of oscillation when suitably energised in a circuit and comprising a layer of semi conductor material, a first pair of electrodes coupled to said layer at spaced positions for subjecting the layer to an electric field, a second pair of electrodes conductively connected to said layer at positions spaced apart in a direction transverse to the distance between the first pair of electrodes and a load element in series or parallel with a pair of input terminals at which an energising potential is applied, connected between the second pair of electrodes, characterised in that the layer has a thickness dimension of between 1 and 8 molecular or atomic diameters and exhibits re entrant constant enegy level contours and negative effective charge carrier mass. The invention also provides a semiconductor device and circuit arrangement therefor, characterised by a combination comprising a substrate of given semiconductor material, having one surface atomically flat a thin foil not greater than four atoms thick of semiconductor material laid down on said substrate and having substantial dimensions in length and width of the order of one centimeter, said foil of semi conductor material exhibiting re entrant constant energy level contours and negative effective charge carrier mass electrodes coupled to said thin foil along lbngitudinal edges thereof for applying an electric field across said length of semiconductor material a source of electric energy and a modulating energy source connected in series to said electrodes electric connectors conductively connected to said thin foil and spaced apart across said width thereof a resonant circuit comprising inductive and capavitive reactance elements connected in shunt circuit between said electric connectors a source of energizing potential and r.f. choke connected in series across said electric connectors a feedback circuit comprising an inductor interposed in series with said modulating energy source and a link circuit inductively coupling said inductor and said resonant circuit, and a load element coupled to said resonant circuit. The invention further provides a semiconductor device and circuit arrangement therefor, characterised by a combination comprising a substrate of semiconductor material an oligatomic or particularari layer of semiconductor material of another type laid down on said substrate, and having substantial dimensions in length and width, said layer of semiconductor material exhibiting re entrant constant energy level contours and negative effective charge carrier mass electrodes connected to a source of electric energy, and coupled to said layer along longitudinal edges thereof for applying an electric field across said length of semiconductor material electric connectors conductively connected to said layer and spaced apart across said width thereof and an output circuit including a load element and terminals for connection across a source of energizing potential connected to said electric connectors. The material of this oligatomic, or particularari layer is selected from a group of materials, each material of which has a much smaller band gap than that of the selected substrate. Examples of materials suitable for the substrate are GaAs, ZnSe, GaAlAs and the like, while materials suitable for the oligatomic layer are p type Ge, Si GaAs, InSb and the like. The latter materials particularly have energy levels which, when graphically represented by a conventional two dimensional constant energy contour plotting configuration, departs from the usual circular pattern to lie on a re entrant closed line pattern. A three dimensional configuration results in a distorted spherical figure having six re entrant hollows , each representing a right circular cone of carrier negative effective mass.Narrowing the structure to substantially two dimensions reduces the number of such reentrant sectors to four. These sectors are cones of extremely flattened elliptical cross section. An electric bias field applied across the plane of the thin foil in one direction tends to shift the charge carrier population into one of these conical sectors of negative transverse effective mass, thereby effecting a negative resistance manifestation across the plane of the thin foil in the other direction, or in other words, in a direction normal to that of the electric field. An energizing potential source and a load element are connected across the width of the layer as output circuitry for further developing and utilizing this negative resistance effect. The invention will now be described in more detail, with reference to the accompanying drawing, in which FIG. 1 is a cross sectional elevation view of a thin foil semiconductor negative effective mass device according to the invention FIG. 2 is a plan view of that semiconductor effective negative mass device connected in a circuit arrangement therefor according to the invention FIGS. 3 and 4 are graphical representations of typical energy levels and contours for materials used in the construction of the thin foil effective negative mass device according to the invention FIG. 5 is a cross sectional elevation view of an alternate construction of an effective negative mass device according to the invention and FIG. 6 is a schematic diagram of a circuit arrangement according to the invention incorporating a thin foil semiconductor effective negative mass device according to the invention. Description The essential structure of a thin foil semiconductor negative effective mass device according to the invention is depicted in FIGS. 1 and 2. The prime object in the fabrication of the device according to the invention is to provide a thin foil 10 of semiconductor material that is sufficiently thick as to enable suitable interaction of an electric field with the flow of current carriers and such effects while at the same time is sufficiently thin as to prevent scattering of the carriers in the depth of the material. For strength and ease of fabrication the thin foil 10 is deposited on a substrate 12 of conventional semiconductor material such as gallium arsenide, GaAs, or zinc selenide, ZnSe, for example, and other materials as will be discussed hereinafter.The semiconductor material, for example p type germanium or p type silicon and the like, for the thin foil 10 has a lesser band gap than the material in the substrate 12. The substrate 12 has a thickness of depth D imparting sufficient strength for the support of the device, and at the same time affords a desired isolation for reducing electron hole carrier scattering as described in greater detail hereinafter. The layer 10 has a thicknessT which is but a few atomic layers or from one to not more than four atoms or molecules thick. Such a layer being but a few particles thick, termed an oligatomic or particularari thin foil herein is construed to be a foil from one to four particles, namely atoms or molecules, thick.The effect obtains with thin foils greater than four particles thick but it diminishes fast with greater thickness, having a tradeoff for the particular application at hand. The thickness T of the foil is therefore less than 1 10 of the thickness D of the substrate. A pair of ohmic or conducting contacts, of which only one 14 is shown, permit electric circuit connections across the width designated I for convenience of the foil 10, while a pair of conductors 16, 18 are spaced apart across the length designated E for convenience of the foil 10 and arranged as non injecting contacts. Integrated circuit fabrication techniques are applied here. The surface of the substrate 12 on which the foil 10 is deposited preferably is a flat plane of variation not greater than the radius of one atom of the material.This atomically flat surface enables the foil 10 to be made as thin as possible. A preferred form of substrate 12 is a wafer of GaAs having an atomically flat 110 plane surface.The length and width dimensions I and E as depicted in FIG. 2 are of the order of 1 centimeter and are not particularly critical, except that the dimensions are chosen to reduce as much as possible any tendency toward carrier scattering. l0 106 An electric field of 10 10 volts centimeter, for example, is created across the foil 10 in one direction E by connecting a source 20 of direct bias potential through a switch 22 to conductors 16 and 18.Another source 24 of direct energizing potential and a load element, shown here as a resistor 26, are connected in series across the thin foil at right angles to the direction of the electric field. A shunt arrangement of energizing source and load element is readily substituted if that is desired. The thin foil 10 exhibits negative resistance across electrodes 14 and 15 under these conditions and current flows through the thin foil in the direction I and in the load resistor 26 across which an output potential is delivered to terminals 28 and 29.Varying the bias potential as by opening the switch 22 and varying the potential obtainable from a variable direct potential source 30, the current flowing in the load resistor 26 is modulated as desired. FIGS. 3 and 4 are diagrams useful in an understanding of the invention. These diagrams schematically show energy levels and contours respectively for materials of interest in the practice of the invention.The materials are three dimensional and the models are based on energy levels and contours about a central point of origin. For many materials the models are spherical, while for other materials the models depart markedly. The particular diagrams are planar the plane is passed through a three dimensional figure as desired for the problem at hand. For many materials the constant energy contours lie on concentric spheres and therefore are circular in the plane as shown in broken lines in FIG. 4. For materials of particular interest in practicing the invention, the models are sort of rounded cubical with six uniformly spaced dimples, and therefore the constant energy contours are reentrant as shown in FIG. 4. According to the invention, thin foils are utilized in order to approach as nearly as possible a two dimensional plane structure, although admittedly the foil has a real and definite thickness and therefore in fact the foil remains three dimensional. The energy level diagram of FIG. 3 seems to indicate the origin of the three contours 31, 32, 33 shown in FIG. 4. In an unbiased arrangement the carriers are concentrated in a cluster at the center denoted as the origin 0.Because of the re entrant nature of the constant energy contours, negative transverse effective mass regions are established.In three dimensional arrangements, six right circular negative mass cones are formed with the apexes at the origin and extending in the directions of the dimples. In the thin foil according to the invention with an electric field applied as indicated by the arrows 36, the carriers are shifting into one of four negative mass regions in accordance with the direction of the electric field. According to the invention the negative mass regions comprise four extremely flattened elliptical cones of negative mass, one of which will be populated by negative mass holes because of the action of the electric field in shifting these holes into this sector. Scattering of the carriers is confined to the very thin almost two dimensional constant energy contour.In this manner a scattering of the carriers out of the selected negative mass cone is substantially obviated for all practical purposes and the desired negative resistance effect clearly obtains. As thus far described, the invention is readily carried out with an insulating semiconductor substrate such as GaAs or ZnSe having the interface surface in the 110 plane on which is deposited a semiconductor thin foil a few atomic layers of p type Ge or p type Si which have degenerate valance band edges, and as a consequence, re entrant constant energy surfaces in the Brillouin zone. An electric bias field applied by non injecting contacts across the semiconductor thin foil is so oriented relative to the crystallographic axes that the current carriers holes electrons are concentrated in a negative effective mass region of the Brillouin zone. The two dimensional nature of the semiconductor thin foil according to the invention substantially prevents the scattering of carriers out of the negative mass region, as would occur in the three dimensional bulk counterpart of Kromer.External circuitry is connected to the semiconductor thin foil by ohmic or conducting contacts at points establishing the leads perpendicular to the direction of the bias field. With this circuit arrangement the carriers exhibit negative transverse effective mass negative resistance insofar as the external circuitry is concerned. When the electric bias field is applied, the carriers will move into the negative transverse effective mass region, and because of the transverse negative resistance, energy will be supplied to the external circuitry, leading to oscillations of frequency determined by the external circuit parameters. The use of elemental germanium or silicon, was predicated on the recognition that the top of their valance bands are known to have the type of constant energy surfaces known as re entrant which indicate that negative transverse effective masses are obtainable. This re entrant characteristic is a consequence of the degeneracy of the highest valance band at the zone center, combined with the fact that germanium and silicon have crystallographic centers of inversion. Considering the neighboring sphalerite compound gallium arsenide, there is again degeneracy at the zone center for the top most valance band, but there is no center of inversion. The latter factor introduces an additional perturbation which splits the degeneracy as one moves away from the zone center, which structure leads to a multiple ellipsoid valance band maximum in place of the desired re entrant characteristic. However, while many materials, for example GaAs, do not have centers of inversion in three dimensional form, a reduction to an essentially two dimensional form according to the invention wherein that structure comprising material of one or two, or a few atomic layers, the desired centers of inversion are observed. For example, a thin foil of GaAs in the 111 or 100 plane consists of all Ga or all As atoms, and a pair of 111 or I1001 Ga and As layers exhibit a center of inversion in the plane between the two thin foils. Thus, if two such foils are arranged as a compound thin foil according to the invention, then such thin foils exhibit centers of inversion and re entrant surfaces in the two dimensional band structure.Therefore, the active region of the thin foil according to the invention is not restricted to materials such as germanium and silicon, but is open to much wider classes of two dimensional semiconductors which have centers of inversion and hence re entrant energy contours in their two dimensional band structures. Since the magnitude of the reentrant characteristic is related to the strength of the interaction between the highest valance band and the lower conduction bands, all at the zone center , materials such as InSb or GaSb which have smaller direct band gaps than GaAs or Ge or Si, accordingly exhibit more appreciable re entrant characteristics. A single layer of GaAs is a neutral layer in the 110 plane because there are equal numbers of Ga and As atoms in such a layer, but there is no center of inversion. In contrast to such non polar, or neutral, layers, an ionic layer obtains when a 100 or 111 layer is deposited, and it is necessary to deposit a pair Ga and As to obtain overall neutrality. When a non polar thin film GaAs is deposited on a lattice matched substrate, such as ZnSe, only a slight relaxation and little or no reconstruction obtains. More generally, the thin foil according to the invention alternately is a two dimensional foil such as 100 or 111 GaAs, and a substrate is an insulating semiconductor alloy such as GaAlAs. The reduction of the amount of material by approaching an essentially two dimensional structure may result in a lack of the desired current.Such a lack is readily overcome according to the invention by paralleling a number of thin foil devices as shown in FIG. 5. Here a multiple of substantially similar devices, for example Ge thin foils on GaAs substrates, are stacked and the connections are made in parallel to the circuitry for developing the negative resistance effect. The foils 12 are essentially the same as that described hereinbefore as are the supporting strata 12 , which strata are sufficiently thick at least 10 times as thick as the thin foil as to provide mechanical support and also to prevent scattering of the carriers from one thin foil 10 to another. FIG. 6 is a schematic diagram of an alternate circuit arrangement for utilizing the negative resistance device according to the invention.The device comprising a thin foil 10 on a substrate 12 is as essentially as described hereinbefore. The electric field is produced by a force of direct bias potential 60 supplied through a switch 62 or through any suitable modulating circuit arrangement shown here as a generator 64. Energizing potential is applied by means of a source 66 and a choke inductor 68 since the energizing potential source is connected in shunt to the device and to the load shown here as a tuned tank circuit 70.The resonant circuit 70 comprises a capacitor 72 and an inductor 74. It should be understood that in many applications either or both of these reactance components will consist partly, or even completely of stray reactance. It should also be understood that a series tuned circuit readily will be substituted if that is more desirable. A link winding 76 is coupled to the winding 74 for supplying a load 80 in more or less conventional manner. As thus described the circuit is utilized as an amplifying circuit. With the addition of another link winding 82 connected to a primary winding 84, which is coupled to a secondary winding 86 interposed in the electric field biasing circuit, positive or negative feedback, depending on the polarity of the respective windings, is applied for providing a negative feedback amplifying circuit or an oscillating circuit.Alternatively, capacitive feedback coupling is readily adapted by those skilled in the art. The thin foil device in a circuit arrangement according to the invention is readily modulated in three other ways. First the device is extremely sensitive to the geometry of the components. Thus if the device is subjected to varying ambient pressure, the geometry will change and the output potential will vary accordingly. Hence it is contemplated that the arrangement according to the invention may be arranged essentially as a microphone or used in an instrumental application as a pressure sensor. As shown in FIG. 2, a source 90 of modulating potential and the like is applied to a conventional modulating circuit 92, connected to a source 94 of energizing potential for modulating the output of a lamp 96. The modulated light output of the lamp 96 is focussed on the thin foil 10 as by an optical system, represented here only by a symbol for a lens 97.Preferably the lamp 96 is that of an infra red radiation generator which will generate electron hole carriers in the foil 10 Referring to FIG. 6, there is shown an arrangement for modulating the thin foil 10 by subjecting it to an electromagetic field normal to the electric field and normal to the current flow. A source 90 of modulating potential, a source of energizing potential 94 and a conventional modulator 92 are arranged to excite a magnetic field generator shown here as a pair of coils 98 and 99, between which the thin film device 10 is conveniently arranged. While the invention has been described in terms of express embodiments and alternatives suggested, it clearly should be understood that those skilled in the art will make changes as required for the application at hand without departing from the invention as defined in the appended claims, concluding the specification.
