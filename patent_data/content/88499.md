# Multiple identical countershaft change speed transmission.

## Abstract
A multiple substantially identical countershaft power shift transmission is provided. The transmission 10 com prises an input shaft 12 and preferably three 16, 18 and 20 input gears and an output gear 22 councentric and rotat able relative thereto. A plurality of substantially identical countershaft assemblies 42, 42A carrying contershaft gears 54, 56, 58 and 60 constantly meshed with the input gears and output gear surround the input shaft and an output shaft 24 generally coaxial with input shaft 12 and carrying the output gear 22 rotationally fixed thereto are provided. A first double acting friction clutch mechanism 26 for selectively frictionally coupling first speed input gear 16 or third speed input gear 18 to the input shaft and a second double acting friction clutch mechanism 28 for selectively coupling second speed input gear 20 or fourth speed output gear 22 are provided and are concentric and driven by the input shaft 12 . Means V, C are provided for selectively actuating the clutch portions 30,32, 36 and 38 of the double acting clutch assemblies with overlapping engagement of the clutch portion being released and the clutch portion being applied.
