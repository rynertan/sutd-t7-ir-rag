## Description
ABSORBENT VEGETABLE MATERIAL AND PROCESS FOR MAKING SAME Thomas F. Rich Technical Field This invention relates to novel absorbent materials of vegetable origin, and the process for making such absorbent materials. Disposable absorbent products e.g. disposable diapers, sanitary napkins, and the like generally contain absorbent webs of wood pulp fibers. Depending on the climate, it takes a tree from about 20 years to about 40 years to mature to a harvestable state. Consequently, to meet the demand for wood pulp fibers to be used in absorbent materials, vast areas of land are necessary for the growing of trees. As another consequence, even though wood pulp fibers are probably the most economical material for use in disposable absorbent products available today, substantial expenditures are being made in the harvesting and growing of the trees. There is therefore a continuing need for alternative, inexpensive absorbent materials, preferably from renewable resources. It has now been discovered that certain pectin containing agricultural by products can be converted to highly absorbent materials, suitable for use in disposable absorbent products, via a relatively simple and inexpensive process. Typical examples of agricultural by products suitable as raw materials for the absorbent materials of the present invention include the residue material from citrus Juice processors and from sugar beet refineries.These materials are therefore abundantly available at low cost. The pectin containing agricultural residue material can be converted to a highly absorbent material by a process involving hydrolysis or partial hydrolysis of the pectin methyl esters present in waste materials and subsequent washing and drying of the material. The absorbent properties of the materials may be further improved by subjecting them to a bleaching step. Such a bleaching step also improves the appearance of the product, thereby making It more acceptable for use in disposable absorbent products. The vegetable derived absorbent materials typically have an absorbent capacity which is from 2 to 5 times that of conventional wood pulp fiber webs. These materials therefore offer an opportunity to reduce the bulk of absorbent products while maintaining their containment capacity. It is therefore an object of this invention to provide an inexpensive absorbent material, suitable for use in disposable absorbent products. It is another object of this invention to provide a process for converting certain pectin conbining agricultural waste materials to the absorbent materials of this invention. Background of the Invention The agricultural waste materials suitable as starting materials for the manufacture of the absorbent materials of the present invention are being produced in large quantities. The waste material from citrus juice processors consisting of peels i.e. albedo and flavedo and rag, issgenerally processed to cattle feed by what has been termed the lime de watering process . This process comprises the steps of treating the waste with lime calcium oxide, calcium hydroxide, or even calcium carbonate to convert it from a slimy, unpressabie condition to a watery, pressable condition pressing the converted waste and drying see, for example, U.S. Patent 2,147,521, issued February 14, 1939 toFlorida Citrus Exchange U.S. Patent 2,215,944, issued September 24, 1943 to Vincente U.S. Patent 2,362,014, issued November 7, 1944 to Citrus Processes, Inc. . Relatively small quantities of citrus waste are used as a source of pectin, which can be used as a thickening agent in food products. Food thickening agents may also be prepared by comminuting citrus peel material, and lowering the degree of esterificatlon of the pectic materials in the citrus peel by enzymatic or chemical treatment. This approach has been disclosed inU.S. Patent 3,982,003 issued September 21, 1976 to Mitchell et al., and in U.S. Patent 4,143,172, issued March 6, 1979 to Mitchell et al. Another attempt at converting citrus waste to a food additive for human consumption is disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,225,628, issued September 30, 1980 to Lynn.According to the process described In this reference, citrus peel particles are de watered by a process very similar to the lime de watering process used in cattle feed production the material is subsequently mixed with sesame grain flour, ground, dried and milled to a desired particle size. U.S. Patent 4,379,782, issued April 12, 1983 to Staub et al. discloses the use of citrus albedo or sugar beet pulp as a dietary fiber. The material is extracted with water or isopropanol to remove soluble carbohydrates and color and flavor materials. In spite of these attempts at finding more profitable uses for citrus waste, almost all of the citrus waste from juice canneries is still being converted to cattle feed and sold at a price which barely provides for recovery of the processing costs. Sugar beet residue commonly referred to as beet pulp , like citrus residue, is generally converted to cattle feed. As for citrus residues, attempts have been reported to convert beet pulp into a food additive suitable for human consumption. An example is Japanese Patent SHO 57 54573, publication date April 1, 1982.This patent discloses a method for upgrading beet pulp by bleaching the pulp in hypochloric acid at pH 6.5 to 7.5, washing with water and drying. The material is reported to be capable of absorbing about 90 of its weight in water. Summary of the Invention The present invention relates to vegetable absorbent material comprising a from 15 to 80 pectin, having a degree of esterification of from i i to 45 and less than 50 of the pectin being in the form of a salt of a divalent cation b from 15 to about 80 of a material selected from cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and mixtures thereof c from 0 to 1 chloroform soluble lipids and d from 0 to 10 non lipid organic materials extractable in a mixture of chloroform, methanol and water, said mixture having a volume ratio chloroform methanol water of 20 4 1 and e from 0 to 6 water soluble metal salts. This invention further relates to a process for preparing an absorbent material from a pectin containing vegetable material, comprising the steps of a comminuting the vegetable material to an average particle size of from 0.05 mm to 3 mm b de esterifying the pectin to a degree of esterification of less than 45 c washing the vegetable material in soft water and d drying the vegetable material to a moisture content of less than 15 . Brief Description of the Drawing Fig. 1 represents a flow chart of the analytical protocol used in characterizing the absorbent materials of the present invention. Detailed Description of the Invention This invention relates to novel vegetable absorbent materials, a process for making the absorbent materials, and absorbent products comprising these novel absorbent materials. This invention is based upon the discovery that pectincontaining vegetable materials can be converted into absorbent materials, using a relatively simple and inexpensive process.Pectin containing vegetable materials which are suitable as starting materials for the production of the absorbent materials of the present invention contain at least 15 pectin. Examples include apples, apricots, citrus peels, sugar beets and watermelon rinds. Zucchini for example, which has a pectin content of about 8 , is not suitable. Citrus peels and sugar beet pulp, each of which is a by product of an important agricultural industry, are available in large quantities and at low cost and are therefore preferred starting materials for the preparation of the absorbent materials of the present invention. The composition parameters of the vegetable starting materials and of the vegetable absorbent materials obtained upon processing have been determined in the comprehensive analytical protocol given below. Percentages of components of the materials, as used herein, are weight percentages as determined by this analytical protocol, except equivalent percent diva lent metals and degree of esterification , which are equivalent percentages of the total amount of polygalacturonic acid. Data obtained by a different analytical method, however, may differ, which precludes a direct comparison with such data. In particular the pectin, cellulose and hemicellulose contents and the degree of esterification which are determined indirectly, are parameters which are sensitive to the analytical method used. In the analytical protocol the water content of a sample of the material to be analyzed is determined by Karl Fischer titration. The amounts of calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium are determined by dry ashing followed by flame atomic absorption analysis of these metals. A third sample of the material Is subjected to water extraction followed by a 40 hour Soxhlet extraction with chloroform. The amount of lipids in the extract is determined 9 ravimetrically hereinafter referred to as chloroform soluble lipids . If the material to be analyzed does not contain components which are both water soluble and chloroform soluble, the water extraction prior to the chloroform extraction may be omitted.Thus, it has been found that a chloroform extract of citrus peel derived absorbent materials does not contain watersoluble components, but that a sugar beet derived absorbent material does contain water soluble components in the chloroform extract. A citrus peel derived material may therefore be extracted with chloroform without prior water extraction, and an accurate reading of the amount of chloroform soluble lipids is obtained a sugar beet derived material, on the other hand, must be extracted with water prior to chloroform extraction in order to obtain an accurate determination of the amount of chloroform soluble lipids. A fourth sample is extracted with chloroform, and is subsequently subjected to a 40 hour Soxhlet extraction with chloro formimethanoliwater 201411, vivid . If the determination of chloroform soluble lipids was made without prior water extraction the residue of that test can be used for this chloroform methanol water extraction. The amount of extracted material, which is determined gravimetrically, is the sum of the amounts of water soluble metal salts and non lipid organic materials.The metal cations are determined by flame ionization the amount of water soluble metal salts hereinafter referred to as watersoluble metal salts is calculated therefrom using the molecular weight of the prevalent anion which is known from the processihg history of the sample in case of chlorine bleaching, for example, the prevalent anion is chloride . The amount of nonlipid organic materials hereinafter referred to as non lipid organic materials is determined by subtracting the amount of water soluble metal salts from the total amount of material extracted with the chloroform methanollwater mixture. The residue of the chloroform methanol water extraction contains cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, pectin and pectates. The residue is split in four parts one part is subjected to an acid hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose, followed by GC analysis of the aldononitrileperacetate derivatives of the sugars. The second part of the residue is analyzed for protein the protein content is calculated from the nitrogen value which is determined calorimetrically using the Nessler reagent. The third part of the residue is analyzed for lignin, using the gravimetrical methodTAPPI T222 os 74. The fourth part of the residue is analyzed for calcium0 magnesium, sodium and potassium by dry ashing followed by flame atomic absorption analysis of the metals.The amount of pectin is calculated from the total amount of bound metals li.e., metals which cannot be removed by chloroform extraction or chloroformlmethanol water extraction and the methoxy content. From the amounts of bound calcium and magnesium and the amount of pectin in the sample, the equivalent percent diva lent metals is calculated as the equivalent percent of the polygalacturonic acid which is present as diva lent metal salt.Likewise, the degree of esterification is calculated as the equivalent percent of the polygalacturonic acid which is present as the methyl ester, from the methoxy content and the total amount of pectin in the sample. The analytical protocol is illustrated by the flow chart ofFigure 1. The water content 1 is determined by Karl Fischer titration, The methoxy content 2 is determined by base hydrolysis followed by GC analysis of the liberated methanol. Total metals 3 are determined by dry ashing followed by flame atomic absorption analysis of the metals. Lipids 4 are determined by gravimetry after a 40 hour Soxhlet extraction with chloroform.The residue of the chloroform extraction is then subjected to a 40 hour Soxhlet extraction with chloroform methanol water 2014 1, vlv v , other extractables 5 are determined gravimetrically. Lignin 6 is determined by gravimetry usingTAPPI method T222 os 74. Protein 7 is calculated from the nitrogen value which is determined colorimetrically using theNessler reagent. Cellulose and hemlcellulose 8 are determined by acid hydrolysis followed by GC analysis of the aldononitrileperacetate derivatives of the sugars. Bound metals 12 are determined by dry ashing followed by flame atomic absorption analysis of the metals. Pectin 9 is calculated from the sum of the methoxy content 2 and bound metals 12. From bound calcium 12 and pectin 9 is calculated the equivalent percent calcium 11.From methoxy content 2 and pectin 9 is calculated the degree of esterification 10 as equivalent percent of polygalacturonic acid which is present as the methyl ester. Pectin , as determined by this method is the material in the composition which is capable of forming methyl esters or binding metals, calculated as polygalacturonic acid. The underlying assumptions are that the pectin does not contain any free acid groups, that all of the pectin is anhydrogalacturonic acid, and that no insoluble alkaline earth metal salts, other than calcium salts, are present. These assumptions have been verified by independent methods to be correct within a reasonable margin of confidence. The sum of cellulose and hemicellulose is taken to be the total of neutral sugars left in the sample after the extractions with chloroform and the chloroform methanol water mixture.Cellulose may be determined separately as the total amount of glucose. The balance of neutral sugars is hemicellulose. It has been discovered that the pectin in the composition plays an important part in determining the absorbent properties of the material. Although compositions differ among species and within species, more than 60 of the pectin in vegetable materials is generally present in the form of the methyl ester. In the case of orange peels, on the order of 20 is present as the calcium salt the balance is generally In the protonated form, or an alkali metal salt, mostly potassium. The pectin in the absorbent materials of the present invention has a degree of esterification of less than 45 . The vegetable starting material must therefore be subjected to a deesterification step which may be carried out by alkaline treatment at a pH of from 8 to 13, or by an enzyme such as pectin esterase. The enzyme is naturally present in citrus peel. Care should be taken that the amount of diva lent metal pectates is not substantially increased. In particular, calcium pectates have been found to be detrimental to the absorption properties of the material. Moreover, the calcium pectates once formed cannot be readily converted to other pectic materials like alkali metal salts or pectic acids. in general, the total equivalent of divalent metals must be less than 50 . The equivalent of calcium is preferably less than 30 . In practical terms this means that calcium hydroxide or calcium carbonate cannot be used for alkaline deesterification.It is not necessary, however, to use distilled or deionized water tap water has been found to not significantly reduce the absorbent properties of the materials, provided the water hardness does not exceed 7 grains gallon corresponding to 120 ppm CaCO3 and provided that no excessive amounts of water are used. The term soft water as used herein therefore refers to water having a degree of hardness of less than 7 grains gallon less than 120 ppm CaCO3 . In particular when citrus waste is used, the vegetable starting material may contain complex mixtures of lipids and lipid like materials, and other non polymeric organic materials.The absorbent properties of the resulting absorbent material may be greatly enhanced by removing these organic extractable materials. It has been discovered that the organic extractables generally belong to one of two classes a first class of materials which are soluble in chloroform and which have been identified as mostly non polar lipids these materials are referred to herein as chloroform soluble lipids and a second class of materials which are not soluble in chloroform alone, but which are soluble in a mixture of chloroform, methanol and water chloroform methanol water 20 4 1 v v v . This second class of materials is comprised of non lipid organic materials and of water soluble metal salts.The absorbent materials of the present invention may not contain more than about 1 chloroform soluble lipids, not more than about 10 non lipid organic materials, and not more than about 6 water soluble metal salts. Hence, the present invention relates to vegetable absorbent materials comprising a from 15 to 60 pectin, said pectin having a degree of esterification of from 1 to 45 , and less than 50 of the pectin being in the form of a divalent metal salt b from 15 to 80 of a material selected from the group consisting of cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and mixtures thereof c from 0 to 1 chloroform soluble lipids d from 0 to 10 non lipid organic materials extractable in a mixture of chloroform, methanol and water, said mixture having a volume ratio chloroform methanol water of 20 4 1 and e from 0 to 6 water soluble metal salts. Although the degree of esterification of the pectin does not appear to have a major effect on the ultimate absorption capacity of the absorbent material, low degrees of esterification are conducive to good wicking properties of the material. High wicking rates are important for a fast uptake of liquid. For use in absorbent products like disposable diapers, sanitary napkins and the like, good wicking properties of the absorbent material are highly desirable. The absorbent materials therefore must contain pectin which has a degree of esterification of less than 45 , preferably less than 20 . The second major component of the absorbent material, next to pectin, is generally a mixture of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. The actual composition of this rr.ixture is to a large extent determined by the choice of the raw material, and to a lesser extent by the process. For example, hemicellulose is likely to be partially removed during processing, which increases the relative amounts of cellulose and lignin in the mixture. Depending on the raw material source, the amount of lignin may be very small. For example, citrus waste has a much lower lignin level than beet pulp yet very good absorbent materials can be prepared from either starting material. It has been discovered that diva lent metal pectates, in particular calcium pectates, are far inferior to alkali metal pectates e.g. sodium pectates with regard to absorbent properties.This is probably due to the fact that divalent metal salts of pectin are cross linked , whereby the divalent metal ion serves as the link between two adjacent pectin molecules. This crosslinking is believed to prevent swelling of the pectin and to thereby reduce its absorbency. Some of the pectin is naturally present as the calcium salt. Care must be taken not to increase the amount of calcium pectate any further. Therefore, during processing the materials should not be exposed to excessive amounts of calcium. If calcium is present in the form of an insoluble mineral salt which is not capable of interacting with the esterified pectin, the presence of calcium is probably not harmful at all. One specific embodiment of this invention is a citrus peelderived absorbent material comprising a from 30 to about 60 pectin, said pectin having a degree of esterification of less than 20 , and less than 30 of the pectin being in the form of a divalent metal salt b from 30 to 60 of a mixture of cellulose and hemicellulose c from 0 to 1 chloroform soluble lipids d from 0 to 10 non lipid organic materials extractable in a mixture of chloroform, methanol and water, said mixture having a volume ratio chloroform methanol water of 20 4 1 and e from 0 to 6 water soluble metal salts. Preferably, the peels of ripe oranges or grapefruits are used as a starting material and the process is carried out in a way as to avoid excessive removal of hemicellulose. A second specific embodiment of this invention is a sugar beet derived absorbent material comprising a from 15 to 35 pectin, said pectin having a degree of esteriflcation of less than 4596 preferably less than 20 , and less than 30 of the pectin being in the form of a divalent metal salt b from 20 to 80 of a mixture of cellulose and hemicellulose c from 0 to 1 chloroform soluble lipids d from 08 to 10 non lipid organic materials extractable in a mixture of chloroform, methanol and water, said mixture having a volume ratio chloroform methanol water of 20 4 1 and e from 0 to 6 water soluble metal salts. Process The process for preparing the vegetable absorbent material from the pectin containing starting material depends to a large extent on the starting material being used. The process is aimed at reducing the degree of esterification of the pectin in the material, and removing excessive amounts of extractable materials.The process therefore comprises the steps of a comminuting a pectin containing vegetable material to a particle size of from 0.05 mm to 3 mm b de esterifying the pectin toba degree of esterification of less than 45 c washing the vegetable material in soft water and d drying the vegetable material to a moisture content of less than 15 . The manner in which the deesterification is carried out is not critical and may, for example, be enzymatic or chemical. Chemical deesterification of pectin may be carried out at acid or alkaline pH. Acid deesterification is not preferred as it is slow and leads to both diva lent ion extraction and hemicellulose degradation. Alkaline deesterification is preferred but care must be exercised. Pectin methyl ester can degrade via a beta elimination mechanism, so pH and temperature should be carefully controlled. Enzymatic deesterification may be carried out with the enzyme pectinesterase this is particularly convenient when citrus peels are used as starting material because the enzyme pectinesterase is naturally present in citrus peels. Alternatively, deesterification may be carried out by soaking the vegetable material particles in a solution of an alkali metal hydroxide. The reaction rate increases with the concentration of hydroxyl ions, therefore the higher the pH, the faster the reaction will be.The pH should therefore be above 8, preferably above 9.Excessively high pH values tend to result in removal of hemicellulose and other desirable materials. Therefore, the pH should not exceed 13, and preferably be below 12. A degree of esterification of less than 45 Is generally achieved after 2 minutes at pH 9.5 or greater. As beta elimination is very temperature dependent, a temperature of 250C or lower is preferred. Prolonged contacting of the vegetable material with the alkali hydroxide solution results in a progressively lower degree of esterification of the pectin. It is generally not necessary to continue this deesterification step for more than 2 hours, since little additional benefit is obtained by doing so. The washing of the material is critical, since it is necessary to remove the alkaline material and excess soluble materials.Washing may be done with water or with an organic solvent. The latter has the advantage that chloroform soluble lipids which may be present in the material are generally to some extent removed by an organic solvent like acetone, but not by a water wash.The washing step may be conveniently carried out as follows.Excess liquid is drained off from the reaction mixture of the deesterification step. Then, enough of the washing liquid i.e.water or an organic solvent is added in order to obtain a slurry with a solids content of 2 . The slurry is equilibrated for about 5 to 15 minutes, and then the washing liquid is drained off. This washing step may be repeated. The number of washing steps is determined by the amount of contaminants in the starting material and the desired composition of the finished absorbent material. Typically, 2 or 3 washing steps will be necessary. After excess washing liquid has been drained off after the last washing step, the liquid content of the remaining material is on the order of 90 . This must be reduced to less than 20 in order to obtain an absorbent material with optimum absorption properties. If an organic solvent Is used in the washing step e.g. acetone, isopropyl alcohol, or methanol , this solvent may be simply removed by evaporating it. The material may also be dried by solvent displacement after the last washing step with water, the material is slurried up with an organic solvent like acetone or methanol, the solvent is then drained off and the excess is evaporated. For economic reasons it may not be feasible to use any organic solvents in the process. In that case a water will have to be removed using a conventional drying technique. This may be either freeze drying, vacuum drying, or thermal drying. Of these three, freeze drying is the most attractive because it does not cause collapse of the fine capillaries which are naturally present in the material. Unfortunately, freeze drying is also the most expensive drying method of these three. Thermal drying is economically the most attractive method of drying available. If the 90 moisture product from the washing step is dried in an oven, a board like material is obtained which is not very absorbent. It has been discovered, however, that the material may be dried by spraying it into a counter current of superheated steam or heated air. The inlet temperature and the flow rate should be controlled as to result in an outlet temperature in the range of from 600C to 750C. This results in a product which has a moisture content of less than 15 . Although thermally dried materials possess good absorption capacities, the absorption kinetics of such materials tend to be slow. The rate of absorption can be vastly improved by adding a surfactant to the slurry during the last washing step. An amount of surfactant of from 1 to 3 by weight of the amount of the slurry is generally sufficient. The type of surfactant is not critical. Examples of suitable surfactants are nonionic surfactants, e.g. ethoxylated fatty alcohols. It is highly desirable to include in the process a bleaching step. Preferably, the bleaching is carried out with an oxidative bleaching agent. Examples of suitable bleaching agents are hydrogen peroxide. perborate, hypochlorite, chlorine dioxide and chlorine. Sodium hypochlorite is a preferred bleaching agent.For optimum properties of the absorbent material, and optimum safety of absorbent products made therewith, excess bleach and electrolytes introduced during the bleaching step will have to be removed. Bleaching is therefore best carried out prior to the washing steps. Since color compounds may be formed during alkaline deesterification, the bleaching step is best carried out subsequent to the deesterification step if alkaline deesterification is used as opposed to enzymatic deesterification . In order to improve the effective use of the bleaching agent, it is desirable to include a washing step subsequent to the deesterification step and prior to the bleaching step, especially when citrus peels are the starting material.Hence, in case alkaline deesterification and bleaching are used, the process sequence is as follows a comminuting the pectin containing vegetable material to a particle size of from 0.05 mm to 3 mm b soaking the pectin containing vegetable material particles obtained in step a in a solution of an alkali metal hydroxide in water at a pH of from 9 to 12 and at a temperature of from 150C to SOOC, for a period of from 2 minutes to 120 minutes c washing the product of step b in soft water d bleaching the product of step c for from 5 minutes to 60 minutes e washing the product of step d in soft water and f drying the product of step e . The effect of bleaching is two fold. It removes color materials, thereby vastly improving the appearance of the absorbent material obtained by this process, and making it more suitable for use in consumer products like disposable diapers, sanitary napkins and the like. Bleaching further tends to decompose chloroform soluble lipids into water soluble fragments. Consequently, the bleaching step significantly reduces the level of chloroformsoluble materials in the finished product. The removal of chloroform soluble lipids is particularly important when citrus peels are used as the starting material.Citrus peels contain high levels of such chloroform soluble lipids, and If water as opposed to organic solvents is used in the washing steps of the process, bleaching is instrumental in reducing the level of chloroform soluble lipids to the desired level. Although whole citrus peels may be used as the starting material, the flavedo part greatly increases the load of chloroform soluble lipids and colored materials. It is therefore desirable to remove the flavedo part of the peel. The flavedo may be shaved off mechanically by machinery which is commercially available and designed for this purpose. Such equipment typically leaves about 30 of the flavedo on the albedo. It has been discovered that when these machine shaved peels are subjected to the process described hereinabove including the bleaching step an absorbent material is obtained which is negligibly less absorbent than the material obtained from an handmade all albedo starting material. Whole citrus peels may also be used as starting material. Highly acceptable absorbent materials may be made therefrom, albeit at the expense of a higher usage of bleaching chemicals. Sugar beets, by their nature, contain only low levels of chloroform soluble lipids. When processing sugar beet pulp, one may therefore forego the bleaching step if absorbent properties are the only concern. However, during alkaline deesterification, beet pulp develops a persistent green color and a bleaching step may be highly desirable or even necessary from an aesthetics viewpoint. The processing of other pectin containing raw materials will have become apparent from the foregoing. The bleaching step may be foregone if the starting material has a low chloroformsoluble lipid content, and contains little colored materials or if the aesthetics of the absorbent material are relatively unimportant e.g. when intended for industrial use . The choice of the method of deesterification enzymatic or alkaline treatment is largely determined by economic determinations enzymatic deesterification is relatively slow alkaline treatment is faster and lends itself better to a continuous operation of the process. The choice of the washing liquid water or an organic solvent is likewise determined by economic considerations with which a person skilled in chemical engineering may be deemed well familiar. Performance Testing A. Partition Test Samples of absorbent materials were subjected to a partitioning test, more fully described hereinbelow. This test has been designed to measure the absorption performance of absorbent materials in competition with conventional cellulose fibrous webs, both under conditions of low liquid load and high liquid loads.The absorption fluid was synthetic urine a solution of 1 NaCI, 0.06 MgCl2.6H2O and 0.03 CaC12.2H20 in distilled water the surface tension of the solution was adjusted to 45 dynes cm with about 0.0025 of an octylphenoxy polyethoxy ethanol surfactant Triton X 100, from Rohm and Haas Co. . This test has been found to be predictive of the absorption capacity under typical usage conditions of absorbent materials when used as absorbent cores in diapers. The partitioning tests were carried out as follows. A piece of polyethylene sheet the kind of material generally used as a backsheet in disposable diapers was placed on a flat, nonabsorbent surface. A round sample 57 mm diameter of the absorbent material to be tested was placed on top of this backsheet. On top of that was placed a piece of paper tissue of the type generally used as envelope tissue in disposable diapers. On top of the envelope tissue was placed a sample of the reference material southern soft wood slash pine fibrous web, 0.1 g cm3 density . Both sample and reference were prepared to have a weight as closely as possible approaching 0.6 g, corresponding to a basis weight of about 0.02 g cm2. The top sample was wetted with a predetermined amount 1 g of synthetic urine, covered with another piece of backsheet, upon which a weight of 4.4 pounds 2 kg was placed. This weight exerts a confining pressure of 1 psi 7 x 109 N m2 when confined the samples have a diameter of 60 mm . After five minutes equilibration time, the weight was removed and the two samples of absorbent material were weighed separately. To facilitate removal, a plastic mesh screen was placed in between the samples prior to the test.The X load , defined as the amount of synthetic urine in grams absorbed per gram of absorbent material was calculated for each sample. The sample was then placed back under the confining weight, and dosed with an additional dose of synthetic urine, equilibrated, and weighed. This was repeated several times typically in the order of 8 10 times so that the relative absorption performance of the test material over a wide range of X loads was obtained as a function of the loading in the reference top layer. B. Capillary Sorption Test The absorption properties of absorbent materials were determined by their synthetic urine absorption and desorption behavior. The basic procedure and the design of the apparatus are described by Burgeni and Kapur, Capillary Sorption Equilibria inFiber Masses , Textile Research Journal, 37 1967 362, which publication is incorporated herein by reference. The test is particularly useful for determining absorption kinetics. The absorption apparatus consisted of a horizontal capillary tube, approximately 120 cm long, connected by a valve to a fluid reservoir. The end of the tube was connected by tygon tubing to a glass funnel containing an ASTM 4 8 micron frit on which the absorbent material sample was placed under a confining pressure of 1 psi 7 x 103 Nix2 . The glass frit funnel was mounted on a vertical pole. The height of the frit above the capillary tube determined the hydrostatic suction being exerted on the sample. In a typical absorption desorption experiment the volume of absorbed synthetic urine was determined as a function of hydrostatic suction, starting at 100 cm. A simplified test was developed to determine the useful capacity of an absorbent web. In this test, the absorbed volume at 25 cm hydrostatic pressure was measured 25 cm, Absorption . Next, the frit containing the sample was lowered to zero hydrostatic pressure and the equilibrium value of sorbed volume measured 0 cm, Void Volume . Then the frit was raised again to the 25 cm mark and the absorbed volume at 25 cm in the desorption mode was determined 25 cm, Desorption . Readings of 25 cm absorption and 25 cm Desorption volumes were made after an equilibration time of 20 minutes readings of 0 cm VoidVolumes were done after an equilibration time of 30 minutes. Example One Florida Valencia oranges juiced with an AMC Extractor were hand shaved to remove the flavedo and rag. The albedo was ground in an Urschel Grinder. Twenty three pounds 10 kg of the ground raw material, at 11.96 solids, was siurried in 75 pounds of water 34 kg , making a 2.8 solids slurry.The slurry was titrated to pH 9.5 and maintained at this pH by caustic addition for 30 minutes. The titration took 1.25 liters of 1N sodium hydroxide. The material was dewatered in a basket centrifuge. It was washed with 75 pounds 34 kg of water while spinning in the centrifuge, and dewatered again. The 14.7 pounds 6.7 kg of filter cake at 10.71 solids that resulted from this was slurried in 43 pounds 19.5 kg of water, making a 2.88 solids slurry. 3.8 liters of 5.25 sodium hypochlorite solution were added to the slurry and mixed for 15 minutes. The bleached material was dewatered in the centrifuge. It was washed again with 75 pounds 34 kg of water while spinning and then dewatered. This resulted in 12.2 pounds t5.5 kg of material at 10.3 solids for a yield of 45.7 . The material was freeze dried to a moisture content of 10 . The chemical composition was determined by the analytical method described hereinabove. The absorption properties were determined by the Capillary Sorption and Partition tests described hereinabove, and compared to those of conventional wood pulp fiber webs.A.

A second batch of citrus peel absorbent material is prepared by the same method. This batch is dried in a flash dry process, as follows. The filter cake obtained after the last centrifuge dewatering step is mixed in a 1 surfactant solution Tergitol 15 S 9 to a 2.5 solids slurry. The slurry is mixed for 15 minutes. The material is dewatered in a basket centrifuge. The resulting filter cake is flash dried in two passes. On the first pass, the air inlet temperature is maintained between 1500C and 2000C, and the air flow is maintained so as to result in an outlet temperature between 600C and 650C. On the second pass the inlet temperature is maintained between 900C and 125 C, and the outlet temperature between SOOC and 550C. A highly absorbent material is obtained. Example Two Four hundred thirty four grams of finely ground sugar beet cattlefeed at 16.38 solids was slurried in 3 liters of water, making a 2.1 solids slurry. The slurry was titrated to pH 9.5 and maintained by caustic addition for 30 minutes. The titration took 12 ml of 1N sodium hydroxide. The material was dewatered in a basket centrifuge. It was washed with 50 pounds 22.7 kg of water while spinning in the centrifuge, and then dewatered.The 462 grams of filter cake at 12.03 solids that resulted from this was slurried in 3 liters of water, making a 1.6 solids slurry. Five hundred ml of 5.25 sodium hypochlorite was added to this and it was mixed for 17 minutes. The bleached material was dewatered in the centrifuge. It was washed again with 50 pounds 22.7 kg of water while spinning, and then dewatered. This resulted in 496 grams of material at 11.28 solids for a yield of 78 .

The shaved peels were ground in an Urschel grinder to a particle size of approximately 0.6 mm. Approximately 195 pounds 88.5 kg of the Urschel ground peel at 12.2 solids was slurried in 380 pounds 172.5 kg of distilled water making a 4.3 solids slurry. At this point a small batch was removad. This was the 0 minute exposure batch. While constantly agitating, the slurry was titrated to pH 9.8 and maintained at this pH by caustic addition. Small batches were removed at 30 and 120 minutes exposure time. Six normal hydrochloric acid was added to bring each caustic treated batch to pH 7.

The 0 min. sample, which is different from the starting material in that it has been bleached and washed, had a chloroform soluble lipids content within limits, probably due to the bleaching step. Hydrolysis with sodium hydroxide further improved the chemical composition of the material, resulting in a corresponding increase of the absorbent capacities. A low degree of esterification increased the sorption rate of the samples. Example Seven One batch of orange peels was converted to absorbent material, using the whole peel i.e., no flavedo was shaved off , using the method described in Example Seven hydrolysis time 30 min., bleaching time 18 min. . Another batch of the same orange peels was subjected to the process described in Example 7 of U.S. Patent 3,982,003 Mitchell for the preparation of food thickeners i.e., adjusting the pH to 8.5 with sodium carbonate, enzymatic hydrolysis for 18 hours, and subsequent dewatering and drying .

Example Eight Calcium Hydroxide and Calcium Hypochlorite Treated Orange Peel Material Florida Valencia oranges were juiced with an AMC Extractor and the peels were machine shaved with a Brown Peel Shaver so that approximately 70 of the flavedo and 90 of the rag was removed. This material was ground in an Urschel grinder to a particle size of about 0.6 mm. Twenty five pounds about 11.3 kg of the ground raw material at 12.4 solids, was slurried in 60 pounds 27.24 kg of water, making a 3.4 solids slurry. The slurry was titrated to pH 9.5 and maintained at this pH by caustic addition for 30 minutes. The titration took 1.10 liters of 1N calcium hydroxide. The material was dewatered in a basket centrifuge. It was washed with 75 pounds about 34 kg of water while spinning in the centrifuge, and dewatered again. The 12.5 pounds 5.6 kg of filter cake was slurried in 65 pounds 29 kg of water. 3.3 liters of 5.25 calcium hypochlorite bleach solution was added and the slurry was mixed for 18 minutes. The bleached material was dewatered in the centrifuge. It was washed again with 75 pounds 34 kg of water while spinning and then dewatered. This resulted in 10 pounds 4.45 kg of material at 14.06 solids. The material was freeze dried to a moisture content of 10 . The material was essentially hydrophobic. This example illustrates the detrimental effect of calcium ions on the absorbent properties of the orange peel material. Example Nine Whole grapefruit peel was chopped into approximately 114 to 3 8 inch ca 6 mm x 9 mm cubes with a Fitzmill. The chopped peel was ground with an Urschel grinder. This ground peel was then chemically treated as follows 680 pounds 308 kg of ground peel was slurried in 2500 pounds 770 kg of soft water in a 500 gallon 1800 1 vessel under strong agitation. To this slurry was added a sufficient quantity of 1 Normal sodium hydroxide to maintain the slurry pH between 9.0 and 9.5 for at least 20 minutes. This required 4 gallons l 14 liters . The slurry was then dewatered with a horizontal vacuum belt filter to 7 12 solids. The resulting filter cake was reslurried in 2500 pounds 770 kg of soft water, again in a 500 gallon 1800 I tank under strong agitation. To this slurry was added 0.10 pounds s 45 g of sodium hypochlorite per pound of solids in the filter cake. The pH of the slurry was maintained at 9.0 to 11.0 by adding 1 Normal sodium hydroxide. 3 gallons 11 I was used. The slurry was maintained in contact with the hypochlorite for 45 minutes and then dewatered again with a horizontal vacuum belt filter. During dewatering it was rinsed with 2500 to 5000 pounds 1135 kg to 2270 kg of water. The resulting filter cake was again slurried in 1600 pounds 1 726 kg of soft water in a 500 gallon 1800 I tank under mild agitation. To this slurry was added 4 pounds 2.9 kg of the nonionic surfactant Tergitol 15 S 9 Union Carbide , which is a secondary alcohol ethoxylate. After 10 minutes of contact time, the slurry was once more dewatered with a horizontal vacuum belt filter, with no washing. The resulting filter cake, containing 8.5 solids was flash dried in a 12 inch 30 cm Barr s Murphy ring flash dryer to produce a granular powder, white to beige in color, containing 108 final moisture. Overall process yield from starting peel to final product was 45 on a solids basis.

Example Ten Red Delicious apples were peeled, quartered, and cored and then the pulp was processed in a disc shredder. One thousand grams of the shredded apple pulp, at 15.36 solids, was slurried in a solution of 4000 ml water and 25 ml 1N sodium hydroxide.The pH of the slurry, after adding the apple pulp, was 10.50.After eleven minutes the pH dropped to 7.45 an additional 11 mls of 1N sodium hydroxide was slowly added, bringing the slurry pH to 9.91. After a total time of thirty minutes, the slurry pH was 9.10. The material was dewatered in a basket centrifuge. It was washed with 25 kg of water while spinning in the centrifuge, and then dewatered. One hundred ninety five grams of material at 8.11 solid was collected. One hundred and eighty five grams of this material was reslurried in a solution of 3800 ml of water and 200 ml of 5.25 sodium hypochlorite solution, and mixed for eighteen minutes. The bleached material was dewatered in the centrifuge, then washed with 25 kg of water while spinning and then dewatered. The material was reslurried with 23 kg of water then it was washed while spinning with 16 kg of water and dewatered.This resulted in 107.57 grams of material at 6.61 solids, yielding 4.63 of the initial shredded pulp solids.

Example Eleven Sugar beet shreds were processed into an absorbent material as follows The shreds were soaked for one hour in soft water, then washed, then passed through a Sprout Waldron disc refiner at a 2 consistency. After refining, the pH of the slurry was adjusted with sodium hydroxide to about 9.8, and maintained at this value for about 30 minutes. The slurry was then dewatered and washed with demineralized water, then slurried in a sodium hypochlorite solution 0.3 g Cl2 per g solids at 2 consistency . The pH of the bleach solution was kept above 8.5 by adding small quantities of sodium hydroxide. The bleaching time was 54 minutes. After bleaching the pulp was washed with demineralized water, and passed through a Sprout Waldron disc refiner. The material was washed four times with isopropyl alcohol isopropanol , then dried in a forced air oven at 700C. The resulting material had a fibrous appearance, with fiber dimensions similar to those of a conventional hardwood pulp. Its absorbent properties were determined by the Partition Test.PARTITION TEST Amount Absorbed, ml Synthetic Urinelg Material, 1.0 psi Reference Sugar Beet Absorbent Wood Pulp Material 1.0 0.9 2.0 3.1 3.0 5.4 4.0 7.2 4.3 7.8 The above process was modified in that the washings with isopropyl alcohol were eliminated.
