# Process for steam reforming a hydrocarbon feedstock and catalyst therefor.

## Abstract
A process of reacting a hydrocarbon feedstock with steam and or carbon dioxide is carried out over a catalyst in the form of at least one undeformable hollow unit permitting gas flows in at least two mutually transverse directions within its boundaries. The catalyst typically comprises random packed metal tubular units with apertures in their walls, such as PALL rings. The process is capable of high throughputs at low pressure drop and with low concentrations of catalytically active metal per unit catalyst bed volume as compared with conventional ceramic ring catalyst.
