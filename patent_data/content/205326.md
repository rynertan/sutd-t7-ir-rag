# ANTIBODY CONJUGATES

## Abstract
An antibody or antibody fragment is modified by chemic al linkage to a synthetic poly amide urea thio urea which contains a plurality of boron atoms or other functional groups, conferring upon the resultant conjugate desirable properties as a diagnostic and or therapeutic agent. In a prefered embo diment, boron containing groups are conjugated to the anti body fragment such that the resultant conjugate contains 50 2000 boron atoms, more preferably with about 96 Boron 10 isotope content, to produce conjugates useful for neutron activated radiotherapy of tumors or pathological lesions.
