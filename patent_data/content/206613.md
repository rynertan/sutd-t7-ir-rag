## Description
The commercial formulations of In spite of these limitations, use of In 1981, a gene encoding the protoxin from a commercial strain of EP A 0093062 discloses a recombinant protoxin gene from what is presumably a different strain In neither of these patents is the sequence of the gene or the protein product disclosed. It is clear that the toxin genes in both cases are bounded by undefined sequences of DNA. The subject invention concerns the engineering of a plasmid that encodes preactivated The nucleotide sequence of the engineered gene of the subject invention is shown in CHART A. Also shown in CHART A is the deduced amino acid sequence of the activated The nucleotide sequence, and deduced amino acid sequence, of the essential In the accompanying drawings, Figure 1 is a construction scheme showing the preparation of plasmids pK7 3 and pK8 1 from plasmids pBR322 and pK15. Step 1 represents Bam Pst digestion 2 represents gel purification of A and B fragments of pBR322, and A and B fragments of pK15 and 3 represents ligation of A A and B B fragments. Figure 2 is a restriction map of plasmid pK8 1, the boxed section indicating the insert DNA within pBR322, all on a scale of 0 11 Kb kilobases . In order to obtain embodiments of the invention, a δ endotoxin gene was cloned from a 72 Md plasmid from Subcloning of the gene was accomplished by first digesting pK15 with This insert was sequenced by the technique of Maxam and Gilbert Maxam, A.M. and Gilbert, W. 1977, Amino terminal analysis of activated toxic protein from This permitted accurate location of the amino terminus of the processed and activated δ endotoxin within the protoxin molecule. The carboxy terminus of the activated toxin molecule was determined by digestion with carboxypeptidase Y and the sequence of the predominant species was found to be Val Thr. Consideration of the molecular weight of the protein and its predicted amino acid sequence resulted in the assignment of Val Thr⁶¹⁰ as the likely C terminus of the predominant species. The sequence disclosed in CHART A includes two amino acid changes to Lys His at positions 609 and 610 of the naturally occurring molecule. The major species present in the bromelain activated endotoxin is therefore predicted to be 585 amino acids in length and has a calculated molecular weight of 65,406 daltons. The N terminus lies at codon 26 and the C terminus of the principal species of the activated molecule at codon 610. A plasmid, named pΔ649, was constructed in which sequences in the 3 half of the structural gene which encode nontoxic and possibly inhibitory regions were deleted while the region encoding the processed protein described above was retained. To produce this construction, advantage was taken of a KpnI site at codon 722 723 in the These studies have allowed the identification of a sequence at the carboxy terminus of the activated The essential functional δ endotoxin lies between codon 26 and codon 608 of the protoxin gene. A sequence at the carboxy terminus of the molecule lying between codons 566 and 608 CHART B is essential to the biological activity of the molecule. Toxicity is much less sensitive to alterations in amino acids lying at the N terminus. Following are examples which illustrate procedures, including the best mode, for practicing the invention. These examples should not be construed as limiting. All percentages are by weight and all solvent mixture proportions are by volume unless otherwise noted. Preparation of plasmid DNA from Restriction endonuclease data reported by Schnepf and Whiteley Schnepf, H.E. and Whiteley, H.R. 1981 The isolated DNA was then digested with The ligated Plasmid pK15, prepared as described in Example 1, was digested with The two fragments from plasmid pK15 were then ligated with the two fragments obtained from digestion of pBR322. The ligation was conducted under standard conditions using T4 ligase. The result of this ligation was two plasmids designated pK7 3 and pK8 1. See FIGURE 1 of the drawing. Plasmid pK8 1 was found to contain the complete δ endotoxin gene present in plasmid pK15. Mutation 649 can be constructed by opening at the unique KpnI site in the Sequencing by the technique of Maxam and Gilbert Maxam, A.M. and Gilbert, W. 1977 Plasmids pK8 1 and pΔ649 have been transformed into Plasmid pKΔH can be made by digesting plasmid pK8 1 with HindIII endonuclease and religating by standard procedures. This results in the deletion of a 1750 bp fragment that stretches between the right hand HindIII site shown in the map of plasmid pK8 1, and the unique HindIII site of plasmid pBR322. The gene product encoded by this construction terminates at or about codon 565 and has a MW of 62,000. The activity of this gene product in a biological assay using tobacco budworm larvae is very low when compared to pΔ649. This plasmid can be recombined with a fragment derived from the construction described in Example 5 to regenerate a gene encoding a fully active protein toxin. Plasmid pDW1, which contains the essential domain of toxicity, can be prepared by digestion of plasmid pΔ649 with HindIII and standard electrophoresis gel isolation of a 285 bp fragment. This fragment can be cloned into the unique HindIII site of the multiple cloning site of any pUC plasmid, pUC8 Supplied by Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ for example, to give plasmid pDW1. This vector can then be used as a vehicle to produce quantities of this 285 bp HindIII fragment. Excision of this fragment from pDW1 and cloning into the HindIII site of pKΔH results in the reconstruction of a gene which encodes an active δ endotoxin in one out of two transformants. Selection can be done by standard antibody or toxicity screening. As is well known in the art, the amino acid sequence of a protein is determined by the nucleotide sequence of the DNA. Because of the redundancy of the genetic code, i.e., more than one coding nucleotide triplet codon can be used for most of the amino acids used to make proteins, different nucleotide sequences can code for a particular amino acid. Thus, the genetic code can be depicted as follows The above shows that the novel amino acid sequence of a protein can be prepared by equivalent nucleotide sequences encoding the same amino acid sequence of the proteins. Accordingly, the subject invention includes equivalent nucleotide sequences encoding the The work described herein was all done in conformity with physical and biological containment requirements specified in the NIH Guidelines.
