The discovery, development, and subsequent commercialization of the antitumor agent cisplatin cis diamminedichloroplatinum II has resulted in expanded interest in metal coordination compounds as medicinal agents over the past decade and one half. Platinum compounds, in particular, have received considerable scrutiny as antineoplastics as part of an ongoing search for second and third generation anologs of cisplatin. Among the goals of this research has been platinum compounds showing greater or different activity or potency than cisplatin and platinum compounds having superior physical and chemical properties than cisplatin. Of particular interest in the latter respect are aqueous solubility and stability. We describe here a series of platinum compounds, in particular, platinum II triamine complexes, some novel, which show antitumor activity and both high water solubility and excellent solution stability. Some platinum triamine compounds have been reported in the literature. These include cis Pt NH₃ ₂ 2 hydroxypyridine Cl Y Y Cl, NO₃ L.S. Hollis, S.J. Lippard, Inorg. Chem, The platinum compounds of this invention are charged Pt II complexes containing three neutral amine ligands and one anionic ligand. As such, they violate established structure activity relationships which state that the requirements for antitumor activity are a neutral complex with adjacent cis reactive X groups M.J. Cleare, Structure Activity Relationships for Antitumor Platinum Complexes in D.N. Reinhoudt, T.A. Connors, H.M. Pinedo, K.W. VandePoll, Eds., Structure Activity Relationships of Antitumor Agents , Martinus Nijhoff, Boston, 1983 . Charged species such as Pt NH₃ ₄ Cl₂ and K₂PtCl₄ have been described as completely inactive, and Triamine compounds of the type Pt dien X X dien diethylene triamine, X Cl,Br have also shown no antitumor activity M.J. Cleare and J.D. Hoeschele, Bioinorganic Chem, The preferred complexes of the present invention have the following structure wherein A₁ and A₂ are ammonia or aliphatic amine ligands, which may or may not be the same and are chosen from ammonia, a linear, cyclic or branched C₁ C₆ alkylamine, or a linear, cyclic or branched C₁ C₆ alkylamine, bearing one or more of the following substituents halo, hydroxy, alkoxy, carboxy, alkoxycarbonyl, or alkylcarboxy. B is chosen from the following heterocyclic compounds pyridine, pyrimidine, pyridazine, pyrazine, imidazole, pyrazole, quinoline, isoquinoline or purine. These may be unsubstituted or bear one or more of the following substituents C₁ C₆ alkyl, C₁ C₆ alkoxy, hydroxy, carboxy, C₁ C₆ alkoxycarbonyl, C₁ C₆ alkylcarboxy, halo, amine, oxo, nitrite, nitro, or amido. X is a monodentate anionic ligand such as halo, hydroxo, pseudohalo, HSO₄, H₂PO₄, ascorbate, or C₁ C₆ carboxylate. Y is an anion chosen from X above or nitrate or perchlorate. X may or may not equal Y. The platinum II triamine complexes of the present invention are prepared by one of two general methods In the method of equation II , the heterocyclic amine B is reacted directly with a cis diamineplatinum complex containing two anionic ligands. The reaction is carried out in water or alcohol at a temperature between ambient and the boiling point of the solvent, but preferably, at about 60 C. Each mole of platinum complex is reacted with one or more moles of B, preferably, 1 to 3 moles. The platinum concentration may vary widely but it is usually between 0.01 and 0.1 In the method of equation III the cis diamineplatinum complex is first reacted with one equivalent of a silver salt for example, AgNO₃ . This reaction may be run in water, alcohol or in a polar organic solvent such as dimethylformamide or dimethylacetamide. The resulting AgX is removed by filtration. The solvated complex is then reacted with one or more moles of B preferably 1 to 2 . The reaction between the cis diamine platinum complex and silver salt is run at ambient to 80 C, preferably at 50 60 , for a time period of several minutes to 24 hours depending on the solvent system. The mixture is usually cooled to ambient temperature or below prior to filtration of AgX. Reaction of the solvated complex with B may take place at any temperature from 0 80 C, but preferably 25 50 C for a period of several minutes to several days. The product is separated and purified as in the method of equation II . The complexes of this invention are useful in tumor chemotherapy having been found active against malignant tumors in animals as, for example, Sarcoma 180 ascites tumors in mammals such as mice. The anti tumor effect exhibited by the subject complexes may also extend to other sarcomas and lymphoid leukemias and to such other tumors as the following lymphosarcoma, myelocytic leukemia, malignant lymphoma, squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, scirrhous carcinoma, malignant melanoma, seminoma, teratoma, choriocarcinoma, embryonalcarcinoma, cystadenocarcinoma, endometriocarcinoma or neuroblastoma and the like. In addition, said complexes may be useful as anti viral, anti inflammatory, anti bacterial and anti parasitic agents. The complexes of this invention may be administered parenterally or orally in admixture with a non toxic pharmacologically acceptable inert carrier or diluent in any of the usual pharmaceutical forms. These include solid and liquid oral unit dosage forms such as tablets, capsules, powders, and suspensions or solutions and suspensions for subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous or intra arterial injection. The term unit dosage refers to physically discrete units which may be administered in single or multiple dosages each containing a predetermined quantity of the active ingredient in association with the required diluent, carrier or vehicle. The quantity of active ingredient is the amount of complex needed to produce the desired therapeutic effect. A typical unit dosage consists essentially of from about 10 450 mg. of active ingredient however, the form in which said ingredient is administered and the frequency of administration is usually determinative of its concentration. Thus, for example, oral unit dosage forms containing 20 450 mg. of active ingredient may be administered one or more times per day depending upon the severity of the tumor which is sought to be treated and the condition of the host animal. By contrast, parenteral administration generally requires from about 10 100 mg. of the active ingredient per unit dosage administered as a daily dose or as a fraction thereof depending upon whether the regimen calls for administration once, twice, three or four times daily. By contrast to the unit dosage , the effective dose is that total dosage which is needed to achieve the desired anti tumor effect. In general, this dosage lies within the range of from about 10 950 mg. of the active ingredient per kg. of body weight of the host animal i.e., mg. kg. . A preferred concentration lies within the range of from about 30 450 mg. kg. For oral administration an effective dose of 50 950 mg. kg. has been found to be most suitable, whereas, in the case of parenteral administration it is usually advisable to employ from about 30 350 mg. kg. These dosages are well below the toxic or lethal dose and they may be varied over a wide range for the symptomatic adjustment of the dosage to the patient which is being treated. The platinum II triamine complexes screened show an effective dose about one half and in some instances less than one fourth of the toxic dose. This represents a clear improvement over the known complex cis Pt NH₃ ₂Cl₂ which, under identical screening, exhibits optimum activity at 9 10 mg. kg. and toxicity at 16 mg. kg. Obviously, the broadest possible range between the effective dose and toxic dose is preferred by clinicians because it affords a wider safety margin. The preferred compositions for oral administration are tablets in which the triamine complex is present in quantities of 5 375 mg. in a pharmaceutically acceptable orally ingestible solid carrier. If desired, the composition may also contain flavors, binders, lubricants and other excipients known in the art. An alternative oral mode is the soft gelatin capsule. Such a composition may also contain from 10 375 mg. by weight of active ingredient dissolved or suspended in vegetable oil, peanut oil, alcohol or glycerine and the like. A hard or dry filled capsule may be prepared by admixing 25 200 mg. of active ingredient with suitable excipients such as lactose and magnesium stearate and putting the mixture into a preformed and suitably sized gelatin sheath. The complexes of this invention may also be formulated as liquid solutions or suspensions or as a dry powder for addition to foods, drinking water, fruit juice or other potable liquids. Tablets are prepared by mixing a complex of this invention, in suitably comminuted or powdered form, with a diluent or base such as starch, sucrose, kaolin or di calcium phosphate and the like. The resulting mixture can be granulated by wetting with a binder such as a syrup, starch paste , acacia mucilage or solutions of cellulosic or polymeric materials, whereafter, the wetted mixture is forced through a screen. As an alternative to granulating, the powdered mixture can be run through a tablet machine and any slugs which are imperfect may be broken into granules. The granules are lubricated to prevent sticking to the tablet forming dies via the addition of stearic acid, a stearate salt, talc or mineral oil and the lubricated mixture is then compressed into tablets. The complexes of this invention can also be combined with free flowing inert carriers and then be subjected to compression so as to form tablets without going through the granulating or slugging steps. A protective coating or sealing coat of shellac, sugar or polymeric material and a polished coating of wax can also be provided. Dyestuffs may be added to distinguish different unit dosages. In this invention the term pharmacologically acceptable inert carrier or diluent denotes a non toxic substance which, when mixed with the active ingredient, renders it more suitable for administration. Compositions intended for oral administration may include such carriers or diluents as glucose, lactose, sucrose, corn starch, potato starch, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, powdered gum tragacanth, gelatin, alginic acid, agar, stearic acid or the sodium, calcium and magnesium salts of stearic acid, sodium lauryl sulfate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sodium citrate, calcium carbonate and di calcium phosphate. Said compositions may also contain non toxic adjuvants and modifiers such as dyes, buffering agents, preservatives, surfactants, emulsifiers, flavoring agents or biocides and the like. The following emodiments illustrate the preparation of representative unit dosage forms. The cis diamineplatinum II pyridine complex, niacinamide, calcium pantothenate, magnesium sulfate, zinc sulfate and magnesium stearate 5.0 Mg. are mixed and compressed into slugs. The slugs are then broken into granules and sifted through an 8 mesh screen. Additional magnesium stearate 5.0 mg. is added and the mixture is then compressed into tablets suitable for oral administration. A soft elastic gelatin capsule is filled with the following ingredients The cis diamineplatinum II 2 hydroxy pyridine complex and wheat germ oil are mixed with sunflower seed oil and the resulting mixture is poured into gelatin capsules suitable for oral administration. An alternative embodiment provides for substituting sunflower seed oil and wheat germ oil with equal amounts of peanut oil to obtain an otherwise similar capsule which is also suitable for oral administration. A hard dry filled capsule may be prepared from the following ingredients The cis diamineplatinum II 6 methyl 2 hydroxypyridine complex is reduced to a No. 60 powder. Niacinamide, calcium pantothenate and sodium ascorbate are passed through a No. 60 bolting cloth and these ingredients are added to the cis diamineplatinum II pyridine complex. This combination of ingredients is mixed for 10 minutes and then poured into a No. 3 size gelatin capsule. The following composition illustrates a representative dosage in dry powder form. In this embodiment the active ingredient is water soluble and it is combined with up to 60 by weight of a suitable flavoring agent. All quantities are in a weight percent relationship. The cis diamineplatinum II 3 hydroxy pyridine complex, flavoring agent and preservative are thoroughly blended to afford a homogeneous dry powder which is readily soluble in water. The resulting formulation may be used as a food additive or it may be blended with other therapeutic agents to afford combination type medicinals. Alternatively, said powder may be dissolved in a pharmacologically acceptable diluent to afford a solution which is suitable for oral administration. Compositions intended for parenteral administration may include such diluents and carriers as water miscible solvents as, for example, sesame oil, groundnut oil, aqueous propylene glycol and a solution of sodium riboflavin. Typical of said compositions are solutions which contain the active ingredient in sterile form. An embodiment illustrating a dosage form suitable for intravenous injection is set forth below. Injectable solutions can be formulated by mixing an ampoule of active ingredient with an ampoule of sterile diluent The cis diamminepyridine II chloride complex and water are mixed thorougly immediately prior to administration. If desired, one or more other active ingredients may be added to provide an injectable solution having enhanced therapeutic activity.

The compounds were evaluated for anti tumor activity against S180 ascites in female CFW Swiss mice by the following procedure Also, on this day, two types of controls 6 mice set are employed 1 Normal 1 set 0.5 ml. of the solvent medium used for the test compound, and 2 Positive control 1 set a known anti tumor agent cis Pt NH₃ ₂Cl₂ in saline at 8 mg. kg. , used to test the response of the biological system. The effectiveness of a compound is measured in terms of the increase in life span ILS of the test animals relative to the controls calculated from the day of tumor inoculation day zero . In order to standardize the test data and permit intercomparisons to be made, the day of evaluation is arbitrarily taken as that day corresponding to twice the mean life span or average day of death of the normal controls. This sets a practical upper limit of 100 on the ILS attainable. For calculation purposes, survivors on the day of evaluation are considered to have died on that day. The ILS is formulated as ILS values above 50 represent significant activity those above 75 represent excellent activity. Sarcoma 180 ascites antitumor screening data for the platinum pyridine complexes described in Examples 1 9 and 19 20 are given in Table 1.
