## Description
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of a liquid epoxy resin by the base catalyzed reaction of epichlorohydrin and a dihydroxyphenyl hydrocarbon in an organic solvent or cosolvent medium. Liquid epoxy resins having a variety of commercial and industrial applications are produced by the base catalyzed condensation reaction of bisphenol A with epichlorohydrin in an organic solvent or cosolvent medium. The cosolvent medium is typically a mixture of a ketone or an alcohol and water. The use of a cosolvent promotes rapid glycidation to a chlorohydrin intermediate and dehydrochlorination to the epoxy resin end product. The process produces an epoxy resin product having suitable viscosity and epoxide equivalent weight EEW for commercial and industrial applications. The reaction mixture in this described preparation process requires an excess of epichlorohydrin and large quantities of the cosolvent in order to produce a suitable liquid epoxy resin product. The necessity for such large quantities of epichlorohydrin and cosolvent adds to the energy requirements for separating the organic solvent and unconsumed reactants from the product. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a new method for the preparation of liquid epoxy resins by the base catalyzed reaction of an epihalohydrin and a dihydroxyphenyl hydrocarbon in an organic solvent medium. It is a further object to reduce the quantity of epihalohydrin necessary for a given product viscosity. It is a further object to reduce the quantity of the cosolvent required for a given product viscosity. It is a further object to reduce the energy requirements for and increase the capacity throughput of a given epoxy resin reaction system. The invention is concerned with a novel process for preparing a liquid epoxy resin by reacting a dihydroxyphenyl hydrocarbon with an excess of epihalohydrin in the presence of an aqueous caustic, characterized in that the process is carried out in two stages of which in stage 1 the reaction is carried out in the absence of an organic cosolvent and the reaction is effected to yield a product mixture comprising from 10 to 60 unconsumed hydroxyl moieties and of which in stage 2 the reaction is continued in the presence of at least 2.5 mole of organic cosolvent per mole dihydroxyphenyl hydrocarbon. In the following description the process will be described in terms of the reaction of the preferred starting materials, epichlorohydrin and bisphenol A. The invention process is particularly suited for the preparation of liquid epoxy resins, which are defined herein as epoxy resins having a viscosity of less than about 250 poises at 25 C. The first stage of the process of this invention process involves the preparation of a partially reacted resin mixture of bisphenol A, an excess of epichlorohydrin, and aqueous caustic. The epichlorohydrin is present in this pre reaction mixture in a molar excess with respect to bisphenol A, usually at least 4 moles per mole of bisphenol A, preferably from 6 to 15 moles for most liquid epoxy resins. The aqueous caustic can be an aqueous solution of a base such as an alkali metal hydroxide. The preferred caustic is sodium or potassium hydroxide. The aqueous caustic is added in an amount of 0.1 to 0.8 mole, preferably from 0.2 to 0.5 mole, per mole of bisphenol A in the pre reaction mixture. The concentration of the caustic in aqueous solution can vary depending on the properties of the resin desired, but will generally be from 10 to 25 weight per cent, preferably from 10 to 15 weight per cent in the first stage and 10 to 25 weight per cent in the second stage. The total caustic added in the invention process will generally not exceed 2.5 moles per mole of bisphenol A. The aqueous caustic added in the first stage will generally be kept to the minimum concentration which will promote the formation of a chlorohydrin intermediate. It is preferred to add less than 1.0 mole, preferably from 0.2 to 0.5 mole, of caustic per mole of bisphenol A in the first stage. The preferred manner of carrying out the first stage of the invention method is to mix the bisphenol A and the epichlorohydrin and then to gradually add the aqueous caustic to this mixture with further mixing over more than 50 of the required reaction period. The preparation of this pre reaction mixture will be carried out in the absence of an organic cosolvent. Water will generally be present in the pre reaction mixture in an amount sufficient to maintain by product salts in solution. In the pre reaction mixture obtained at the end of stage 1 from 10 to 60 unconverted hydroxy moieties will remain. The second stage of the invention epoxy resin preparation method involves the addition of an organic cosolvent to the intermediate product of the first stage and the completion of the reaction of the epoxy resin in this added solvent. The cosolvent can be any suitable essentially inert organic cosolvent for the epichlorohydrin and bisphenol A reactants, including organic solvents such as alcohols and ketones. Suitable alcohols include C₁ C₈ saturated aliphatic alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, propanol isopropyl alcohol and butanol, for example, and suitable ketones include C₁ C₆ saturated aliphatic ketones. The cosolvent can be added as a mixture of organic solvents, such as alcohols and or ketones with water. The preferred cosolvent systems for the invention method are mixtures of acetone and water, isopropyl alcohol and water, and t butanol and water. Preferably the cosolvent will be added in an amount of from 4 to 20 moles, based on moles of bisphenol A. The intermediate product mixture of the first stage may be mixed with the organic cosolvent before or after an optional separation of the intermediate product mixture comprising unreacted epichlorohydrin and bisphenol A and any reaction product from brine present as a result of the formation of an alkali metal halide condensation reaction by product. The organic phase and the brine may be separated by any suitable method, preferably by static phase separation. The second stage of the process of this invention is carried out to essentially complete conversion of the hydroxyl moieties to the liquid epoxy resin product. Stage 2 in which the condensation reaction of the epoxy resin is completed, may include additional addition of the aqueous caustic as the reaction proceeds, with optional brine separation between caustic additions. The amount of aqueous caustic added in the second stage will generally be 60 or greater of the total caustic added, and the total amount of caustic added in the first and second stages will preferably be less than 2.3 moles of base per mole of the dihydroxyphenol. The reaction product of stage 2 will be a dilute solution of the resin in epichlorohydrin, water and solvent. The resin is recovered by any suitable method such as extraction or evaporation. Dissolved organic materials in the brine, including resin, epichlorohydrin and solvent, can be recovered by suitable means such as extraction or distillation. The first stage will generally be carried out at a pressure of about 100 to 400 kPa and a temperature of from 60 to 140 C. The stage 1 product is dissolved in the cosolvent to a concentration of from 30 to 80 weight per cent, based on the weight of the cosolvent, and the resulting solution is contacted with the aqueous caustic solution under condensation reaction conditions. The second stage is preferably carried out at a pressure of from 100 to 400 kPa and a temperature of from 60 to 90 C. The products of the second stage are subjected to phase separation, and the organic phase including the epoxy resin product is washed with water to a neutral pH. This may be followed by distillation of volatiles from the washed organic phase to yield the desired epoxy resin product. The second stage preferably includes at least three caustic contacting steps in the presence of the organic cosolvent, with intervening brine removal. Such a process permits operation of the process on an essentially continuous basis. The invention process involving delayed addition of the solvent requires less epichlorohydrin starting material and solvent for each mole of bisphenol A as compared with a process in which the starting reactants are present in solvent ab initio and are not pre reacted in the absence of solvent. The viscosity of the final product is comparable to that achieved in the conventional method, even when prepared in the presence of lesser amounts of epichlorohydrin and solvent. The practice of the invention process can thus lower energy requirements for the process, as a result of lower volumes of excess epichlorohydrin and cosolvent to be separated from the resin product, and increased throughput capacity for a given residence time, from an increase in product quantity relative to reaction mixture quantity. The epoxy resin preparation process is particularly suited for the preparation of liquid epoxy resin products having a viscosity of about 60 to about 250 poises at 25 C as determined by ASTM D 445 74 , an EEW of about 170 to about 210 as determined by ASTM D 1652 , and a saponifiable chlorine of about 0.005 to about 0.200 weight per cent. Such liquid epoxy resin products are useful in preparing varnishes and coatings and in sealing and encapsulating electronic components. Examples of dihydroxyphenyl alkanes that may be employed in lieu of bisphenol A are 1,2 dihydroxyphenylhexane, 1,4 dihydroxyphenyl cyclohexane, 3,3 dihydroxyphenyloctane, 4,4 dihydroxyphenyldodecane and the like. The invention is illustrated in detail by the following examples. The first two examples illustrate the preparation of a liquid epoxy resin in a comparison process in which the reactants are not pre mixed in the absence of an organic cosolvent, so does example 6.

The second, third, and fourth portions of caustic were similarly added to the organic phase in 6 minutes and 4 minutes hold , 2 minutes and 8 minutes hold , and 2 minutes and 8 minutes hold , respectively. Each addition was made after brine separation. The resulting organic phase from the fourth brine separation was washed with deionized water twice to a neutral pH, and the volatiles were removed from the resin product by vacuum evaporation. The resin product had a viscosity of 120.7 poises at 25 C, the HPLC estimated EEW was 185.6, and the Sap Cl was 0.031 weight per cent.

Without brine separation, in the second stage, 212.9 g of t butanol about 8 1 molar TBA to BPA , 66.5 g of epichlorohydrin about 2 1 molar ECH to BPA and 50.7 g of water were then mixed with the above reaction mass and the reaction temperature was raised to 60 C. A second portion of 20 w NaOH solution 79.1 g was added to the above mixture in 6 minutes, followed by 4 minutes hold before the first brine separation. To the organic phase was added another 39.6 g of 20 weight per cent NaOH solution in 2 1 3 minutes, followed by 9 1 3 minutes hold before the second brine separation. The last portion of 20 weight percent NaOH solution 13.2 g was added to the organic phase in 2 1 2 minutes, followed by 10 minutes hold. Following the last brine separation, the organic phase was washed with deionized water twice to a neutral pH. The volatiles were vacuum removed to yield a 105.7 poises resin product at 25 C. The HPLC estimated EEW was 182.3 and the Sap Cl was 0.017 w. This case showed product viscosity and Sap Cl improvement using the delayed cosolvent addition technique over that described in comparative Example 6, even though there was a significant amount of ECH in the t butanol water solvent. This simulates a condition of incomplete t butanol ECH separation when fractionating t butanol and ECH from the resin product in the washed resin solution for recycle.
