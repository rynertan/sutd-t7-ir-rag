# Molded case circuit breaker apparatus having trip bar with flexible armature interconnection.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a circuit breaker including a trip bar assembly 60 which is movable to a circuit breaker tripping position by a bimetallic element 38 deflecting in response to an overload current, and by a magnetic armature 66 magnetically attracted yoke 100 in response to a fault or short circuit current. The armature 66 is connected to the trip bar assembly 60 in such a manner flexible attachment member 68, and rigid, preferably metallic, backing member 67 as to cause the trip bar assembly to move positively as one with the armature during movement thereof due to magnetic attrac tion, and to enable the trip bar assembly by virtue of the flexible armature attachment 68 to be moved beyond its normal tripping position when the armature is in its fully attracted position. Enabling the trip bar assembly to move beyond its tripping position enables it to yield to the bimetallic element 38 in the event of a wide deflection thereof resulting from high thermal loading. Thus, the bimetallic element can deflect essentially unrestrainedly and, hence, without risk of taking a set and falling out of calibration. Accommodating wide bimetallic deflections in this manner permits the use of small gap magnetic trip means for fast response.
