# Readily repairable and lightweight cover for a heated vessel.

## Abstract
A lightweight cover provides heat insulation for a heated vessel such as a soaking pit. The cover has a pair of opposing frame members 47 with ceramic fiber insulation 14 positioned therebetween. The insulation is secured in movable engagement such as a free floating and swinging engagement. In this mode, com pression can be exerted against the insulation 14 to most desirably reduce heat loss otherwise caused by heat induced ceramic fiber shrinkage. Moverover, with this structure a ceramic fiber heat seal can be achieved around edges of the soaking pit.
