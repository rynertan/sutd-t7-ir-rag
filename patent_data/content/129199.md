# A method for controlling the operation of a microwave excited oxygen plasma surface treatment apparatus.

## Abstract
A method for sequentially controlling the operation of a micro wave excited oxygen plasma surface treatment apparatus in order to improve and control the quality of sur face treatment. The pressure within a reactor 10 is continu ously monitored and measured and a first pressure signal is issued when the pressure is reduced to a predetermined first level, whereupon flow control valves 52, 54 are opened to allow oxygen gas to flow through microwave discharge tubes 34 into the reactor 10 . A second pressure signal is issued when the pressure increases to a second pressure range and microwave power generators 20, 22 are energized to excite the oxygen flowing therethrough. The plasma density is con tinuously monitored and measured, preferably in terms of the luminous intensity of the plasma, the amount of reflected microwave power, or a combination thereof. The plasma sur face treatment is terminated after a timed duration.
