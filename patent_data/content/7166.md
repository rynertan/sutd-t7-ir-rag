# A method of bonding together thermoplastic sheets using high frequency vibratory energy, and article comprising regions of thermoplastic sheets bonded together by this method.

## Abstract
A method of bonding together overlying regions of ther moplastic sheet using high frequency vibratory energy is pro vided in which sets of elongate energy directors 24,30 are disposed between adjacent sheets 10,14,26 in an orientation such that the director elements of one set 24 cross those of the next adjacent set 30 . When a compressive force and the high frequency vibratory energy are applied to the sheets, the pressure and vibratory energy are concentrated in the regions where energy directors cross so that the thermoplastic mater ial in those regions is first to soften. By initially concentrating the pressure and vibratory energy, the bonding time is sub stantially reduced and an even flow of melted material is assured.
