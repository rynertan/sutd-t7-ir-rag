## Description
DETERGENT CONTAINING NONIONIC CATIONIC SURFACTANT AND BUILDER MIXTURE Technical Field This invention relates to detergent compositions containing a nonionic cationic surfactant mixture and, as an improved builder mixture, a combination of aluminosilicate and polycarboxylate builder materials. These compositions deliver excellent particulate soil removal performance and greasy oily soil removal benefits along with fabric softening, static control, color fidelity and dye transfer inhibition benefits.Compositions which utilize mixtures of selected nonionic and cationic surfactants, but without the particular builders described wherein, are defined in European Petents No. 0000234., Cockrell, publishedJanuary 1 0, 1979,. No. 0000235, Murphy, published January 10, 1979, and No. 0004121, Murphy, publish ed September 19, 1979, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. Background Art The property possessed by builder materials of improving detergency levels of soaps and synthetic detergents is known Such builders. permit the attainment of better cleaning performance than is possible when so called unbuilt compositions are used However, the behavior and mechanisms by which builders perform their function are only partially unierstood. It is known. that good builders must be able to sequester most of the calcium and or magnesium ions in the wash water since these ions are detrimental to the detergency process.However, it is difficult to predict which compounds possess useful combinations of builder properties because of the complex nature of detergency and the countless factors which contribute both to overall performance results and the requirements of environmentai acceptability. Sodium tripolyphosphate STP has been found to be a highly efficient cleaning and. detergent builder and this compound has been widely used for .decades in cleaning and detergent formulations. However, because of the recent emphasis on removing phosphates from detergent and cleaning compositions, suitable replacements for phosphate builders, which would deliver effective cleaning performance and be environmentally acceptable, are being sought. Inorganic builders other than STP are generally not satisfactory for use as a builder in detergent formulations because of their poor builder properties. Sodium aluminosilicates, commonly known as zeolites, have been proposed for use in detergent formulations since they are able to soften water by removing calcium ions, but they are not very effective in removing magnesium ions from water. It has also recently been taught that by combining specific types of cationic surfactants with a narrowly defined range of alcohol ethoxylate type nonionic sur factants, within defined nonionic cationic ratios, simple, unbuilt detergent compositions which deliver good cleaning performance and fabric care benefits, can be formulated. see e.g. European Patents No. 0000234, Murphy No. 0000235, Cockrell, en4t ko. 0 00 412lj Murphy all of which have been incorporated herein by reference. These unbuilt detergent compositions, although ge erally.equivalent to fully built phosphate compositions known in the art, still are capable of further improvement. Thus, it can be seen that there is a need for new detergent compositions with cleaning properties superior or equivalent to phosphate built detergents, but which do not contain phosphates, and which achieve environmental acceptability by being readily biodegradable. Now, according to the present invention, there is provided new detergent compositions with a cationic nonionic surfactant mixture and, as an improved builder mixture, a combination of aluminosilicate and polycarboxylate builder materials. These compositions provide cleaning performance superior to that of phosphate built compositions and also provide other fabric care benefits, such as softening and static control. Summary of the Invention The present invention encompasses a detergent composition, which contains from 0 to about 5 phosphate materials, comprising a from about 1 to about 95 of a surfactant mixture consisting essentially of i a nonionic surfactant having an HLB of from about 5 to about 17 and ii a cationic surfactant, having the formula 12 m x L wherein each R is an organic group containing a straight or branched alkyl or alkenyl group optionally substituted with up to 3 phenyl or hydroxy groups and optionally interrupted by up to 4 structures selected from the group consisting ofEMI3.1 and mixtures thereof, each R containing from about 8 to about 22 carbon atoms, and which may additionally contain up to about 20 ethylene oxide groups m is a number from 1 to 3 each R2is an alkyl or hydroxy alkyl group containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms or a benzyl group, with no more than one R in a molecule being benzyl x is from 0 to 11, the remainder of any carbon atom positions being filled by hydrogens Y is selected from the group consisting of I N EMI4.1 EMI4.2 wherein p is from 1 to 12, wherein each p is from 1 to b2, EMI4.3 wherein each p is from 1 to 12, and 10 mixtures thereof L is 1 or 2, the Y groups being separated by a moiety selected from the group consisting of R1 and R analogs having from one to about twenty two carbon atoms and 2 free carbon single bonds when L is 2 Z is an anion in a number sufficient to give electrical neutrality to the molecule said cationic surfactant being at least water dispersible in admixture with said nonionic sufactant wherein the ratio of said nonionic surfactant to said cationic surfactant is from about 1 1 to about 100 1 and b from about 5 to about 99 of a detergency builder mixture consisting essentially of i a water insoluble aluminosilicate material selected from the group consisting of tl Zeolites A, X, or P B , or mixtures thereof, having a particle size diameter of from about 0.01 microns to about 25 microns and containnng at least 10 water of. hydration 2 amorphous hydrated aluminosilicate material of the empirical formula Mz zAlO2 ySiO2 wherein M is sodium, potassium, ammon ium, z is from about 0.5 to about 2, y is 1, said. material having a particle size diameter of less than about 100 microns, a magnesium ion exchange capacity of at least about 50 milligrams equivalents of CaCO hardness per gram of anhydrous aluminosilicate, and a Mg exchange rate of at least about 1 grain ga lon minute gram gallon and 3 mixtures thereof and ii a polycarboxylate builder material wherein the weight ratio of the aluminosilicate material to the polyzarboxylate material is from about 1 10 to. about 10 1.. Disclosure of the Invention This invention comprises the discovery of an improved builder mixture for use in detergent compositions containing selected nonionic cationic surfactant mixtures.The builder mixture, a combination of aluminosilicate and polycarboxylate builder materials, delivers excellent particulate soil removal performance and greasy oily soil removal benefits. These compositions also provide fabric softening, static control, color fidelity and dye transfer inhibition benefits. The detergent compositions are particularly good in 10 400C water, especially when the particle size diameter of the aluminosilicate material is from about 0.5 to about 2 microns. The essential elements in the detergent composition of this invention are a nonionic cationic surfactant mixture, and a mixture of aluminosilicate and polycarboxylate builder materials. Surfactant Mixture The compositions of the present invention comprise, by weight, from about 1 to about 95 , preferably from about 15 to about 60 , and most preferably from about 20 to about 50 , of a mixture of particularly defined nonionic and cationic surfactants, defined hereinafter, within ratios of nonionic to cationic surfactant of from about 1 1 to about 100 1, preferably from about 1 1 to about 50 1, and more preferably from about 3 1 to about 40 1. Optimum removal of greasy oily soils is generally obtained with nonionic cationic surfactant ratios of from about. 5 1 to about 20 1 while optimum removal of particulate soils is obtained with compositions having nonionic cationic surfactant ratios of from about 2 1 to about 9 1, especially from about 3 1 to about 6.5 1, most especially from about 3.5 1 to about 5.5 1, with these ratios being particularly effective where the cationic surfactant used is of the dilong chain variety disclosed and claimed in European Patent o. 00G4121, Murphy, published Septer. her 19, 1979, and incorporated herein by reference. The compositions of the present invention are preferably formulated so as to have a pH of at least about 7 in the laundry solutions at conventional usage concentrations, in order to optimize their overall cleaning performance, to aid in their manufacturina and processing, and to minimize the possibility of washing machine corrosion.

Utilizing the nonionic and cationic components, defined above, preferred compositions of the present invention may be formulated using the guidance provided by the reduced monomer concentration of the cationic component cur in the laundry solution. Specifically, the selection of a CR value for given nonionic and cationic surfactan t pair will determine the ratio in which to combine those surfactants.A given nonionic cationic surfactant pair will give its best particulate or grease oil removal performance when it is formulated to have a CR value which falls within the ranges defined herein. The reduced monomer concentration of a surfactant is obtained by dividing the concentration of the surfactant monomer present in the laundry solution by the critical micelle concentration CMC of that surfactant. As used in this application, CMCs are determined at 105 F in water containing 7 grains gallon of mixed 2 1 Ca Ng hardness, unless otherwise stated. The concept of reduced cationic monomer concentration is explained in detail in European Patent No. 0000235, IGurphy , published January 10, 1979 Tamamushi and Tamaki, Proceëdings of the Second International Congress of SurfaceActivity, III, 449, Academic Press, Inc. 1957 and Clint, Chem. Soc. Far. Trans., I, 71, i327 1975 , all of which are incorporated herein by preference. The reduced cationic monomer concentration of, the nonionic cationic surfactant mixture is defined by equations a through c , below.In systems where grease oib removal is to bye optimized it is preferred that the CR value of the nonionic cationic sur factant mixture be in the range of from about 0.002 to about 0.2, especially from about 0.002 to about 0.15, most preferably from about 0.002 to about 0.08. In compositions wherein the particulate soil removal capabilities are to be optimized, it is preferred that the nonionic cationic surfactant mixture have a CR of from 0.005 to about 0.2, especially from about 0.008 to about 0.15,, most preferably from about 0.01 to about 0.1. It is in the area of overlap i.e., CR equals about 0.005 to about 0.2 of these CR ranges that the compositions of the present invention yield both optimum particulate and greasy oily soil removal.

The compositions will exhibit their best grease oil.. removal performance when the temperature of the wash solution in which they are used falls within about 20 C, preferably within about 15 C, and most preferably within about 10 C, of the cloud point of the nonionic cationic surfactant mixture. As used herein, the term 1 cloud point means the temperature at which a graph plotting the light scattering intensity of the composition versus wash solution temperature begins to sharply increase to its maxImum value, under the following experimental conditions The light scattering intensity is measured using aModel VM 12397 Photogoniodiffusometer, manufactured bySociete Francaise d instruments de controle et d analyses,France the instrument being hereinafter ref erred to as SOFICA . The SOFIA sample cell and its lid are washed with hot acetone and allowed to dry. The surfactant mixture is made and put into solution with distilled water at a concentration of 1000 ppm. Approximately a 15 ml. sample of the solution is placed into the sample cell, using a syringe with a O.2u nucleopore filter.The syringe needle passes through the sample cell lid, so that the cell interior is not exposed te at ..csphe ic dust. The sample is kept in a variable temperature bath, and both the bath and the sample are subject to constant stirring. The bath temperature is heated using the SOFICA s heater and cooled by the addition of ice heating rate 1OC minute the temperature of the sample is determined by the temperature of the bath. The light scattering 90 angle intensity of the sample is then determined at various temperatures, using a green filter and no polarizer in the SOFICA.Builder Mixture The detergent compositions herein contain from about 5 to about 99 , preferably from about 20 to about 60 , by weight of a detergency builder mixture.

Other suitable polycarboxylates for use herein are the polyacetal carboxylates fully described in U.S. Patent 4,144,226, issued March 13, 1979 to Crutchfield et al, and U.S Patent 4,146,495, issued March 27, 1979 to Crutchfield et al, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. These polyacetal carboxylates can be prepared by bringing together under polymerization conditions an ester of glyoxylic acid and a polymerization initiator. The resulting polyacetal carboxylate ester is then attached to chemically stable end groups to stabilize the polyacetal carboxylate against rapid depolymerization in alkaline solution, converted to the corresponding salt, and added to a surfactant, European Patent No. 80200102.4,Rodriguez et al.,filed on February 7, 1980, incorporated herein by reference, discloses a builder system containing these polyacetal carboxylates along with aluminosilicate builder materials, for use in detergent compositions, which preferably contain nonionic cationic surfactants. Preferred polyzarboxylate builders for use in the present invention are sodium or potassium nitrilotriacetate or citrate, or mixtures thereof. The compositions of this invention contain from 0 to about 5 phosphate materials, and are preferably substantially free of phosphateinaterials Addttional Components In. particularly preferred embodiments of the present invention, the detergent compositions additionally contain from about 2 to about 25 , preferably from about 2 to about 16 , and most preferably from about 2 to about 10 of a fatty amide surfactant, such as ammonia amides e.g., coconutalkyl ammonia amide, diethanol amides, and ethoxy lated amides .In relation to the nonionic cationic surfactant system,. the. ratio of the cationic nonionic mixture to the amide component in the composition is in the range of from about 5 1 to about 50 1, preferably from about 8 1 to about 25 1. The addition of the amide component results in a composition which exhibits improved antiredeposition of both clay and greasy oily soils. This development is described in greater detail in Japan PatentNo. 79 39414, Cambre, published on March 26, 1979, incorporated herein by reference. Preferred amides are C8 C20 monoethanol amides, C8 C20 diethanol amides, and amides having the formulaEMI26.1 wherein R is a Cg C20 alkyl group, and mixtures thereof.Particularly preferred amides are those where the alkyl group contains from about 10 to about 16 carbon atoms, such as coconut alkyl monoethanol or diethanon amide. Such compounds are commercially available under the tradenamesSuperamide GR, from Onyx Chemical Co., Jersey City, N.J.,Superamide F 3 from Ryco, Inc., Conshohocken, Pa., andGafamide CDD 518, available from GAF Corp., New York, N.Y. These amide components may also be added in small amounts, i.e., from about 2 to about 5 , to act as suds modifiers. Specifically, they tend to boostthe sudsing in an active system which exhibits relatively low sudsing, and depress the sudsing in. an acFive system which exhibits relatively high sudsing. The compositions of the present invention may also contain additional ingredients generally found in laundry detergent compositions, at their conventional art established levels, as long as these ingredients are compatible with the nonionic and cationic components required herein. For example, the compositions may contain up to about 15 , preferably up to about 5 , and most preferably from about 0.001 to about 2 , of a suds suppressor component. Typical suds suppressors useful in the compositions of the present invention include, but are not limited to, those described below. Preferred silicone type suds suppressing additives.are described in U.S. Patent 3,933,672, issued January 20, 1976, Bartolotta et al.., incorporated herein by reference. The silicone material can be represented by alkylated polysiloxane materials such as silica aerogels and xerogels and hydrophobic silicas of various types. The silicone material can be described as a siloxane having the formula EMI27.1 wherein x is from about 20 to about 2,000, and R and R1 are each alkyl or aryl groups, especially methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl and phenyl. Polydimethylsiloxanes R and R are methyl, having a molecular weight within the range of from about 200 to about 200,000, and higher, are all useful as suds controlling agents.Additional suitable silicone materials wherein the side chain groups R and R are alkyl, aryl, or mixed alkyl and aryl hydrocarbyl groups exhibit useful suds controlling properties. Examples of such. ingred ients include diethyl , dipropyl , dibutyl , methylethyl , phenylmethyl polysiloxanes and the like. Additional useful silicone suds controlling agents can be represented by a. mixture of an aikylated siloxane, as referred to hereinbefore, and solid silica. Such mixtures are prepared by affiting the silicone to the surface of the solid silica. A preferred silicone suds controlling agent is represented by a hydrophobic silanated most preferably trimethylsilanated silica having a particle size in the range from about 10 millimicrons to 20 millimicrons and a specific surface area above about 50 m2 gm intimately admixed with dimethyl silicone fluid having a molecular weight in the range from about 500 to about 200,000 at a weight ratio of silicone to silanated silica of .from about 19 1 to about 1 2. The silicone suds suppressing agent is advantageously releasably incorporated in a water soluble or waterdispersible, substantially non surface active, detergent impermeable carrier Particularly useful suds suppressors are the selfemulsifying silicone suds suppressors, described in U.S.Patent 4,075,118, Gault et al, issued February 21, 1978, incorporated herein by reference. An example of such a compound is DB 544, commercially available from Dow Corning, which contains a siloxane glycol copolymer together with solid silica and a siloxane resin. Microcrystalline waxes having a melting point in the range from 350C 1150C and a saponification value of less than 100 represent additional examples of a preferred suds regulating component for use in the subject compositions, and are described in detail in U.S. Patent 4,056,483., Tate, issued November 1, 1977, incorporated herein by reference.The microcry5talline waxes are substantially water insoluble, but are water dispersible in the presence of organic sur factants. Preferred microcrystallLne waxes have a melting point from about 65 C to 1000C, a molecular weight in the range from 400 1,000 and a penetration value of at least 6, measured at 77tF by ASTM D1321. Suitable examples of the above waxes include microcrystalline and oxidized microcrystalline petrolatum waxes Fischer Tropsch and oxidized Fischer Tropsch waxes ozokerite ceresin montan wax beeswax candelilla and carnauba wax. Alkyl phosphate esters represent an additional pre ferred suds suppressant for use herein These preferred phosphate esters are predominantly monostearyl phosphate ,which, in addition thereto, can contain di and tristearyl phosphates and aroo oleyl phosphates, whi.ch can contain di and trioleyl phosphates. The alkyl phosphate esters frequently contain some trialkyl phosphate. Accordingly, a preferred phosphate ester can contain, in addition to the monoalkyl ester, e.g. monostearyl phosphate, up to about 50 mole percent of dialkyl phosphate and up to about 5 mole percent of trialkyl phosphate Other adjunct components which may be included in the compositions of the present invention, in their conventional art established levels for use i.e., from about 0 to about 408 , include semi polar nonionic such as amine oxides , anionic, zwitterionic and ampholytic cosurfactants detergency builders bleaching agents bleach activators soil release agents particularly copolymers of ethylene terephthalate and polyethylene oxide terephthalate, such asMilease T sold by ICI, United States, as disclosed in U.S.Patent 4,132,680r Nicol, issued January 2, 1979, incorporated herein.by reference soil suspending agents corrosion inhibitors dyes fillers optical brighteners germicides pH adjusting agents alkalinity sources hydrotropes enzymes enzyme stabilizing agents perfumes solvents carriers suds modifiers opacifiers and the like. However,. because of the numerous and diverse performance advantages of the present invention, certain conventional components, such as cosurfactants and other detergency builders, as well as fabric softening and static control agents, will not generally be necessary in a particular formulation, giving the compositions of the present invention a potential cost advantage over conventional detergent softener compositions.In fact, because the compositions of the present invention give such outstanding clay removal performanoe across the range of water hardness conditions, for environmental reasons the compositions of the present invention contain. less than about 5 phosphate materials. Preferred compositions are substantially or totally free of such phosphate materials., without decreasing the performance of the compositions. Preferred compositions of the present invention are also substantially free of carboxymethylcellulose in order to optimize the clay removal performance of the system.Finally, while the compositions of the present invention may contain anionic materials, such as anionic surfactants and hydrotropes e.g., alkali metal toluene sulfonates , it is preferred that particular anionic materials be contained in amounts sufficiently small such that not more than about 10 , preferably not more than about 5 r 05 the cationic surfactant, contained in the laundry solution is complexed by the anionic material Such a complexing of the anioni material. with the cationic surfactant, decreases the overall cleaning and fabric conditioning performance of the composition.Suitable anionic materials may be selected based on their strength of complexation with the cationic material included in the composition as indicated by their dissociation constant .Thus, when an anionic material has a dissociation constant of at least about 1 x 10 3 such as sodium toluene.sul fonate , it may be contained in an amount up to about 408, by weight, of the cationic surfactant where the anionic material has a dissociation constant of at least about 1 x 10 5, but less than about 1 x 10 3, it may be contained in an amount up to about 15 , by weight, of the cationic surfactant and where the anionic material has a dissociation constant of less than about 1 x 10 5 such as sodiumC11.8 linear alkylbenzene sulfonate , it may be contained only in amounts up to about 10 , by weight, of the cationic surfactant. Preferred compositions are substantially free of such anionic materials. Examples of cosurfactants and detergency builders which may be used in the compositions of the present invention are found in U.S. Patent No. 3,717,630, Booth, issued February 20, 1973, and European Patent No. 0000235 urçhy, published anuary 10, 1979, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. However, these components, particularly the anionic surfactants, should be checked with the particular nonionic cationic surfactant system chosen, and used in an amount, so as to be certain that they will be compatible with the nonionic cationic surfactant system. The compositions of the present invention may be produced in a variety of forms, including liquid, solid, granular, paste, powder or substrate compositions. Preferred substrate articles may be formulated, according toU.S. Patent No. 4.170.565, Murphy, published onOctober 9, 1979, incorporated herein by reference. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the compositions of the present invention are formulated as liquids and contain up to about 20 of a lower alkyl C1 to C4 alcohol, particularly ethanol.Liquid compositions containing lower levels of such alcohols i.e., about 7 to 12 tend to exhibit less phase separation than compositions containing higher alcohol levels, Granular compositions herein may also contain up to about 15 by weight of alkali metal silicates, especially sodium silicate 2.0 ratio , to increase flowability and physical stability of the granules. The compositions of the present invention are used in the laundering process by forming an aqueous solution containing.from about Q.01 100 parts per million to about 0ç38 3,000 parts per million , preferably from about 0.02 to about 0.2 , and most preferably from about O.Q3 to about 0.15 , of the detergent compositions defined herein, and agitating the soiled fabrics in that solution.The fabrics are then rinsed and dried. When used in this manner, the compositions. of the present invention yield outstanding particulate and greasy oily soil removal, together with fabric softening, static control, color fidelity, and dye transfer inhibition benefits, without requiring the use of any of the other conventionally used fabric softening and static control laundry additives. All percentages, parts, and ratios used herein are by weight unless otherwise specified. The following nonlimiting examples illustrate the compositions of the present invention. EXAMPLE I Identical clay soiled cotton, polyester c6tton, and polyester swatches were washed in aqueous solutions having dissolved therein 500 parts per million ppm . of a surfactant mixture containing 4.5 parts of the nonionic surfactant C12 13 E6 5 condensation product of C12 13 alcohol with 6.5 moles of ethylene oxide, commercially available as Neodol 23 6.5 from Shell Chemical Company and 1 part of the cationic surfactant dihydrogenated tallowalkyl dimethylammonium chloride 600 ppm of the builder or builder mixture listed below and 87 ppm of monoethanol amine.The swatches were washed for 10 minutes in a miniature agitator containing 1 1 2 gallons of washing liquor at 1000F and artificial water hardness 2 moles Ca to 1 mole Mg at levels of 2, 7 and 12 grains pex gallon.The swatches comprised approximately 4 by weight of the washing liquor. After washing, the swatches were spun dry and rinsed with 1 1 2 gallons of water, at 1000F, having the same water hardness as that of the water they were washed in. The swatches were then, dried in a miniature electric dryer. A Hunter Reflectometer was used to obtain a reflectance reading in Hunter Whiteness Units for each of the laundered swatches. A higher reflectance reading indicates greater cleaning effectiveness.The results were as follows Fabric Water Hardness Hunter Whiteness Units Solution Containing 600 ppm Sodium CitrateCotton 2 gr. gal. 20.37 2.69 7 7 gr. gal. 18.59 1.40 12 gr. gal. 11.50 1.19Polycotton 2 gr. gal. 63.47 2.13 7 gr. gal. 62.17 0.31 12 gr. gal. 55.85 0.59 Polyester 2 gr. gal. 74.35 1.05 7 gr. gal. 72.65 1.13 n 12 gr. gal. 70.75 1.05 Solution Containing 600 ppm Sodium NitrilotriacetateCotton 2 gr. gal. 27.88 1.49 7 gr. gal. 24.71 1.26 12 gr. gal. 15.84 1.68Polycotton 2 gr. gal. 65.35 1.91 7 7 gr. gal. 63.55 0.42 12 gr. gal. 58.35 0.84Polyester 2 gr. gal. 81.14 1.34 7 gr. gal. 80.38 0.48 12 gr. gal. 75.95 1.17 Solution Containing 600 ppm Polyacetal Carboxylate Cotton 2 gr. gal. 28.60 0.30 7 7 gr. gal. 24.98 0.69 12 gr. gal. 15.94 0.96Polycotton 2 gr. gal. 59.86 do 1.34 7 7 gr. gal. 56.52 3.07 12 gr. gal. 50.08 3.12Polyester 2 gr. gal. 70.06 0.83 7 gr. gal. 61.55 0.81 12 gr. gal. 46.45 2.04 Solution Containing 600 ppm Sodium MellitateCotton 2 gr. gal. 21.82 0.39 7 gr. gal. 16.29 2.63 12 gr. gal. 14.72 1.17Polycotton 2 gr. gal. 62.43 0.37 7 gr. gal. 56.50 0.67 12 gr. gal. 59.41 1.00Polyester 2 gr. gal. 74.00 1.84 7 gr.gal. 73.64 0.18 12 gr. gal. 65.46 1.23 Solution Containing 600 ppm Zeolite A Cotton 2 gr. gal. 17.85 2.51 7 7 gr. gal. 11.43 1.37 12 12 gr. gal, 7.57 1.90EMI33.1 average Hydrated, particle. diameter 1 10 microns same through out this Example Polycotton 2 gr. gal. 55.54 1.34 7 7 gr. gal. 48.37 1.43 12 gr. gal. 57.94 0.75Polyester 2 gr. gal. 71.65 0.86 7 gr. gal. 71.20 0.76 12 gr. gal. 69.17 1.53 Solution Containin g 600 ppm Zeolite X Cotton 2 gr. gal. 19.02 1.50 7 gr. gal. 14.77 2.04 11 12 gr. gal. 14,29 1.21Polycotton 2 gr. gal 54.73 1.09 7 gr. gal. 50.89 4.47 12 gr. gal. 59.41 1.34Polyester 2 gr. gal. 71.98 0.98 7 gr. gal. 71.32 1.36 12 gr. gal. 70.29 0.72 Solution Containing 300 ppm Zeolite A and 300 ppm Sodium NitrilotriacetateCotton 2 gr. gal. 31.82 0.96 7 gr. gal. 29.40 0.68 12 gr. gal. 24.84 1.89Polycotton 2 gr. gal. 67.24 0.47 7 gr. gal. 66.85 1.57 12 gr. gal. 62.88 1.07Polyester 2 gr. gal. 82.84 1.32 7 gr. gal. 80.81 1.34 12 gr. gal. 77.67 0.58 Solution Containing 300 ppm Zeolite A and 300 ppm Sodium CitrateCotton 2 gr. gal. 27.66 0.80 7 gr. gal. 26.80 1.41 n 12 gr. gal. 21.96 0.47Polycotton 2 gr. gal. 64.40 0.67 7 gr. gal. 62.68 0.37 12 gr. gal. 61.31 1.48 Hydrated, particle diameter 1 10 microns Polyester 2 gr. gal. 78.11 0.55 7 gr. gal. 77.65 2.31 12 gr. gal. 74.28 0.68 Solution Containing 300 ppm Zeolite A and 30Q ppm Polyacetal Carboxylate Cotton 2 gr. gal. 37.57 1.30 7 7 gr. gal. 33.48 0.55 12 gr. gal. 25.66 1.37Polycotton 2 gr. gal. 67.09 1.20 7 gr. gal. 63.54 0.44 12 gr. gal. 58.37 0.80Polyester 2 gr. gal. 70.09 1.52 7 7 gr. gal. 68.89 1.32 12 gr. gal. 64.87 1.23 Solution Containing 300 ppm Zeolite A and. 300 ppm Sodium MellitateCotton 2 gr. gal. 28.04 2.07 7 7 gr. gal. 27.26 0.58 12 gr. gal. 24.78 0.21Polycotton 2 gr. gal. 63.74 0.84 7 gr. gal. 60.61 2.09 12 gr. gal. 59.35 1.71Polyester 2 gr. gal. 74.88 0.51 7 gr. gal. 71.34 1.75 12 gr. gal. 66.55 3.25 Solution Containing 150 ppm Zeolite A and 450 ppm Sodium NitrilotriacetateCotton 2 gr. gal. 30.91 1.49 7 gr. gal. 28.34 1.33 12 gr. gal. 13.73 1.24Polycotton 2 gr., gal 67.80 0.35 7 7 gr. gal. 60.98 1.82 12 gr. gal. 55.23 1.22Polyester 2. gr. gal.. 84.22 0.98 7 gr. gal. 82.11 0.68 12 gr. gal. 77.47 0.43 Solution Containing 150 ppm Zeolite A and 450 ppm Sodium CitrateCotton 2 gr. gal. 25.22 3.07 7 gr. gal. 21.15 0.92 12 gr. gal. 15.56 2.12Polycotton 2 gr. gal. 63.63 1.31 7 7 gr. gal. 62.62 1.72 12 gr. gal., 57.27 2.42Polyester 2 gr. gal. 81.75 0.86 n 7 gr. gal. 78.11 1.02 12 ,12 gr. gal., 71.82 1.33 Solution Containing 150 ppm Zeolite A and 450 ppm Polyacetal Carboxylate Cotton 2 gr. gal. 28.44 0.80 n 7 gr. gal. 25.25 0.08 12 gr. gal. 14.31 1.18Polycotton 2 gr. gal. 60.36 1.73 7 7 gr. gal. 57.30 0.82 12 gr. gal. 50.83 0.57Polyester 2 gr. gal. 77.51 1.26 7 7 gr. gal. 73.85 0.29 n 12 gr. gal. 67,35 1.05 Solution Containing 150 ppm Zeolite A and 450 ppm Sodium MellitateCotton 2 gr. gal. 23.65 0.75 7 gr. gal. 17.28 1.15 12 gr. gal. 14.52 2.64Polycotton 2 gr.Jgal. 59.13 1.92 n 7 gr. gal. 56.82 2.96 12 gr. gal. 54.92 1.66Polyester 2 gr. gal. 76.37 1.48 7 gr. gal. 75.73 0.99 12 12 gr. gal. 76.80 0.22 These results clearly demonstrate that synergistic cleaning performance was provided by the combination of the aluminosilicate and polycarboxylate builder materials.Substantially better overall cleaning was provided, at the same total builder level in otherwise identical compositions, by the detergent composition containing the builder mixture than was provided by the detergent compositions containing only the individual builders. Substantially similar cleaning results are obtained when the cationic surfactant is replaced, in whole or in part, by ditallowalkyldimethylammonium methyl sulfate, ditallowalkyldimethylammonium iodide, dihexadecylalkyldimethylammonium chloride, dihexadecylalkyldihydroxylethylammonium methyl sulfate, dioctadecylalkyldimethylammonium chloride, dieicosylalkyl methyl. ethyl ammonium chloride, dieicosylalkyl dimethylammonium bromide, methyl 1 tallowalkyl amido ethyl 2 tallowalkyl imidazolinium methyl sulfate, or mixtures of these surfactants. Substantially similar results are also obtained where the nonionic surfactant in Composition A is replaced, in whole or in part, by the condensation product of C14 15 alcohol with 2.25 moles of ethylene oxide the condensation product of C14 15 alcohol with 7 moles of ethylene oxide the condensation product of C12 15 alcohol with 9 moles of ethylene oxide the condensation product of C12 13 alcohol with 6.5 moles of ethylene oxide, which is stripped so as to remove lower ethoxylate and nonethoxylated fractions the condensation product of coconut alcohol with, 5 moles of ethylene oxide the condensation product of coconut alcohol with s moles of ethylene oxide the condensÅation product of C12 15 alcohol with 7 moles of ethylene oxide the condensation product of tallow alcohol with 9 moles of ethylene oxide a 1 1 by weight mixture of the condensation product of C12 15 alcohol with 7 moles of ethylene oxide and the condensation product of C14 15 alcohol with 7 moles of ethylene oxide and other mixtures of those surf actants. Excellent cleaning results are also obtained where the ratio of nonionic surfactant to cationic surfactant used is about 2 1, 3 1, 3.5 1, 5 1, 6 1 or 9 1. Cleaning benefits are also obtained when the weight ratio of the aluminosilicate material to the polycarboxylate material is from about 1 10 to about 10 1, especially when from about 1 4 to about 4 1. At aluminosilicate polycarboxylate ratios above 1, the cleaning advantages are most readily apparent at high water hardness levels, such as above 7 grains gallon. Similar synergistic cleaning effects are obtained when the aluminosilicate material is any hydrated Zeolite A, X orP B , having a particle size diameter of from about 0.07 microns to about 25 microns, especially from about 0.1 microns to about 10 microns. Substantially similar cleaning performance is obtained when the number of segments n in the polyacetal carboxylate builder averages at least 4, but especially when n averages between 10 and 200.
