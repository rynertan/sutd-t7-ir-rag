# Apparatus and method for processing fluids in a centrifugal force field.

## Abstract
A fluid processing apparatus and method which utilizes centrifugation to separate constituent components of e.g. blood, in a flexible bag 8 . The less dense separated components e.g., supernatant, is expressed from the bag 8 by centrifugal force acting on a plate 15 adjacent the bag and the more dense component e.g. RBC s , remains. The bag 8 is oriented at a double angle in the centrifuge rotor 28 so that less dense component accumulates at one location A and more dense at a second location C diagonally opposite the first location, thus facilitating removal of the less dense component to a further bag 2 and washing of the more dense component in the bag 8 by wash solution expressed from a still further flexible bag 20 by centrifugal force acting on a plate 17 adjacent the bag.
