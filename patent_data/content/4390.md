# Process for preparing alpha naphthol esters of carboxylic acids.

## Abstract
A process for preparing alpha naphthol esters of aliphatic carboxylic acids by reaction of naphthalene with aliphatic carboxylic acids, consisting in the reaction of an aliphatic carboxylic acid in a medium consisting of an aliphatic carboxylic acid and in the presence of a system composed of a saline compound of cobalt II, of a ketone containing in its structure at least a methylene or methine group in alpha position in respect of the carbonyl group, and of oxygen, at a temperature ranging from 70 to 110 C.
