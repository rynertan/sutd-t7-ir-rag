# Control strategy for microlithography instrument.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a microlithography instrument which employs a vector scan strategy with a movable substrate stage whose position is continuously monitored, an electron beam source for exposing a substrate on said stage by beam deflection technology, with means for storing pattern data to be exposed on said substrate, methods for sorting said data into groups or frames with pattern placement coordinates referenced to corresponding frame centers, and means for monitoring the position of said stage as the latter continuously moves so that the beam accurately tracks the moving substrate while the beam is deflected to define the pattern in each frame. The coordination of stage motion and beam deflection enables the instrument to vector scan as the substrate moves allowing full speed potential of vector scan strategy to be realized.
