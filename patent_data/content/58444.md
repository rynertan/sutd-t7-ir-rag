# Washing composition.

## Abstract
Washing compositions especially designed for washing mixed coloured fabrics including mixed loads of coloured and white fabrics at lower temperatures are disclosed. The washing compositions comprise a bleach system useful for the reduction of dye transfer in fabric washing at lower temperatures, said bleach system consisting essentially of 1 a peracid compound which may be an organic peracid, a peracid salt or an organic peracid precursor which generates peracids by hydrolysis or perhydrolysis, and 2 an organic or inorganic material which delivers iodide ions in aqueous media. Preferred material which delivers iodide ions in aqueous media is a water soluble iodide salt, such as potassium or sodium iodide.
