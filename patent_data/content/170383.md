# Improved aromatic carboxylic anhydride catalysts.

## Abstract
An improved catalyst for molecular oxidation of an aromatic hydrocarbon to form the corresponding aromatic carboxylic anhydrides is prepared by the steps of forming a catalyst precursor by depositing on titanium dioxide solids in the anatase form a discontinuous monolayer amount of at least one soure of tantalum oxide, calcining the thus formed catalyst precursor under conditions sufficient to convert the tantalum oxide source into the oxide form, depositing upon the calcined catalyst precursor a catalytically effective amount of at least one vanadium compound which is convertible into vanadium oxide upon heating and calcining the vanadium deposited solids under conditions sufficient to convert the vanadium compound into vanadium oxide.
