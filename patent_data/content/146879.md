# POLYPHENYLENE ETHER RESIN BLENDS HAVING IMPROVED ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT STABILITY

## Abstract
The ultraviolet light stability of polyphenylene ether resins and blends is improved by the addition of certain compounds which are intramolecular hybrids of a hindered amine and a hindered phenol. Plasticized, flame retardant and mineral filled glass reinforced versions are also dis closed.
