# LOCKING CONFIGURATION FOR A WHEEL RIM FLANGE RETAINING RING

## Abstract
A retaining ring 30 for use in combination with a wheel rim 10 having a separable bead flange 14 to secure the separable bead flange on the rim in the absence of a properly inflated tire is characterized by an inboard facing portion 30a and an outboard facing portion 30b and a split in the ring defining terminal ends, 32, 33 each terminal end having a circumferentially oriented first bore 36, 37 in the inboard facing portion 30a and a second bore 38, 39 in the outboard facing portion 30b at an angular relationship with flang respect to the first bore. A groove 40, 41 70, 71 in the outer surface of the retaining ring 30 interconnects each first bore with each second bore and a steel lockwire 50 is threaded through the bores from one terminal end to the other and seated in the grooves and the ends of the wire 50a, 50b are twisted together to lock the terminal ends 32, 33 in a specific spaced orientation d such that the ring may expand a limited amount when subjected to centrifugal forces tending to expand the ring and the wire 50 limits the amount of such expansion and maintains the separable bead flange 14 on the wheel rim 10 .
