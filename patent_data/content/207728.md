NOVE PYRASOLINE COMPOUNDS, PROCESS FOR PRODUCTION THEREOF, AND INSECTICIDES CONTAINING THEM AS ACTIVE INoRsDlENT8 This invention relates to a Pyrasoline compound represented by the general formulaEMI1.1 wherein X represents a hydrogen or halogen atom or a methyl or methylsulfonyloxy group, Y represents a hydrogen or halogen atom or a trifluoromethyl group, Z represents an oxygen or sulfur atom, and A represents an oxygen atom or NH , a process for its production, and to an insecticide comprising it as an active ingredient. This compound is useful in various industrial fields, especially in the agricultural field as an insecticide. Research and development work on insecticides have been done over many years, and have resulted in the development and practical acceptance of numerous chemicals, for example organochlorine insecticides such as DDT and BHC, organophosphorous insecticides such as parathion and malathion, and carbamate insecticides such as carbaryl and methomyl. Use of some of these insecticides has been restricted, however, because they give rise to problems of persistence, accumulation and environmental pollution. Furthermore, some insect pests have acquired resistance to these insecticides as a result of using them over many years. On the other hand, pyrethroid insecticides have been developed and gained practical acceptance which have low mammalian toxicity and easily decompose in a natural environment with little persistence and whose decomposition products are non toxic.However, insect pests having resistance to some of these pyrethroid insecticides have recently appeared. It is desired therefore to develop a novel chemical having outstanding insecticidal property. Embodiments of the invention may allow one to solve the aforesaid problems of the prior art, and to provide an excellent insecticidal compound having a new structure, a broad insecticidal spectrum and high insecticidal activity. According to the invention there is provided a novel pyrazoline compound represented by the following general formulaEMI2.1 wherein X represents a hydrogen or halogen atom or a methyl or methylsulfonyloxy group, Y represents a hydrogen or halogen atom or a trifluoromethyl group, Z represents an oxygen or sulfur atom, and A represents an oxygen atom or NH .They are novel compounds discovered for the first time by the present inventor and are not described in the prior litetrature. According to this invention, there is also provided a process for producing pyrazoline compound represented by the following general formulaEMI3.1 wherein X represents a hydrogen or halogen atom or Ã¢ methyl or methylsulfonyloxy group, Y represents a hydrogen or halogen atom or a trifluoromethyl group, Z represents an oxygen or sulfur atom, and A represents an oxygen atom or NH , which comprises reacting a compound represented by the general formulaEMI3.2 wherein X and A are as defined above, with a compound represented by the general formula EMI4.1 wherein Y and Z are as defined above. According to this invention, there is also provided an insecticide comprising a pyrazoline compound represented by the above general formula I DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to novel pyrazoline compounds of the general formula I EMI4.2 wherein X is a hydrogen or halogen atom or a lower alkyl group, especially methyl group or methylsulfonyloxy group, Y is a hydrogen or halogen atom or a trifluoromethyl group, Z is an oxygen or sulfur atom, and A represents an oxygen atom or NH , which are useful as an insecticide. The process of this invention for producing the compound of general formula I is schematically shown as follows. EMI5.1 X, Y, Z and A are as defined above. Specifically, a 3 aryl 4 phenyl 2 pyrazoline derivative represented by general formula II is reacted with a phenyl isocyanate or isothiocyanate derivative represented by general formula III in the presence or absence of an inert solvent. Examples of the inert solvent are tetrahydrofuran, ethyl ether, benzene, toluene, acetonitrile, pyridine, dichloromethane, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride and l,3 dimethyl 2 imidazolidinone. The reaction temperature and time may be varied widely according to the starting compounds. Generally, the reaction temperature is 10OC to 120 0C, preferably OOC to 100 C, and the reaction time is generally 0.1 to 30 hours, preferably 0.5 to 24 hours. A starting compound of general formula II in which A is an oxygen atom Compound of formula IIa J can be synthesized in accordance with the following scheme. EMI6.1 X is as defined above. Specifically, the pyrazoline derivative of general formula IIa can be produced by reacting diphenyl ether with a phenyl acetyl chloride of general formula IV r for example in the presence of anhydrous aluminum chloride, reacting the resulting 4 phenoxyphenyl benzyl ketone derivative of general formula V with formaldehyde in the presence of a catalyst in a solvent such as methanol or ethanol, and reacting the resulting compound of general formual VI with hydrazine in an alcohol solvent such as methanol, ethanol or isopropanol. A starting compound of general formula II in which A is NH compound of general formula IIb l can be synthesized in accordance with the following scheme.EMI7.1 In the formulae, X is as defined above. Specifically, the pyrazoline derivative of general formula IIb can be produced by reacting acetanilide with an ethylene acetal derivative of general formula VII in dimethylacetamide solvent, for example, in the presence of cuprous iodide, thereafter treating.the product with an alkali and an acid, reacting the resulting benzylketone derivative of formula VIII with formaldehyde in the presence of a catalyst in a solvent such as methanol or ethanol, and reacting the resulting compound of formula IX with hydrazine in an alcohol sovlent such as methanol, ethanol or isopropanol.

The treated seedlings were placed in a greenhouse, and immediately after air drying or 10 days after air drying, the leaves were cut off, and put into plastic cups. Then ten 2nd instar larvae of diamondback moth were set free in each cup. After 72 hours, the numbers of killed and living larvae were counted and mortality was calculated. The results are shown in Table 5. In these tests, a compound of the following formula described in GB 1,514,2851 was used as a comparative compound.EMI39.1 Table 2EMI40.1 tb SEP Test SEP Compound SEP Mortality SEP tb SEP No. SEP 1 SEP 95 tb SEP 2 SEP 100 tb SEP 3 SEP 100 tb SEP 4 SEP 100 tb SEP 5 SEP 100 tb SEP 6 SEP 100 tb SEP 7 SEP 100 tb SEP 8 SEP 90 tb SEP 9 SEP 100 tb SEP 10 SEP 100 tb SEP 11 SEP 100 tb SEP 12 SEP 100 tb SEP 13 SEP 100 tb SEP 14 SEP 100 tb SEP 15 SEP 100 tb SEP 16 SEP 100 tb SEP 17 SEP 100 tb SEP 18 SEP 100 tb SEP 19 SEP 100 tb SEP 20 SEP 90 tb Comparative SEP compound SEP 0 tb Non treated SEP O tb Table 3EMI41.1 tb SEP Test SEP Compound SEP Mortality SEP tb SEP No. SEP 1 SEP 100 tb SEP 2 SEP 80 tb SEP 3 SEP 100 tb SEP 4 SEP 100 tb SEP 5 SEP 70 tb SEP 6 SEP 100 tb SEP 7 SEP 100 tb SEP 8 SEP 90 tb SEP 9 SEP 75 tb SEP 11 SEP 100 tb SEP 12 SEP 100 tb SEP 13 SEP 100 tb SEP 16 SEP 90 tb SEP 17 SEP 100 tb SEP 18 SEP 100 tb SEP 19 SEP 100 tb Comparative SEP compound SEP 0 tb Non treated SEP O SEP tb Table 4EMI42.1 tb SEP Test SEP Compound SEP Mortality SEP tb SEP No. SEP 1 SEP 100 tb SEP 4 SEP 100 tb SEP 6 SEP 100 tb SEP 7 SEP 100 tb SEP 12 SEP 100 tb SEP 15 SEP 100 tb SEP 17 SEP 100 tb SEP 18 SEP 100 tb Comparative SEP compound SEP 20 tb Non treated SEP O tb Table 5EMI42.2 tb SEP Mortality SEP SEP SEP tb SEP one SEP the SEP 10 SEP days tb SEP Test SEP Compound SEP day SEP of SEP the SEP after SEP the tb SEP treatment SEP treatment tb SEP No. SEP 1 SEP 100 SEP 100 tb SEP 3 SEP 100 SEP 100 tb SEP 7 SEP 100 SEP 100 tb SEP 11 SEP 100 SEP 100 tb SEP 12 SEP 100 SEP 100 tb SEP 15 SEP 100 SEP 90 tb SEP 16 SEP 100 SEP 100 tb SEP 17 SEP 100 SEP 100 tb SEP 18 SEP 100 SEP 80 tb SEP 19 SEP 100 SEP 100 SEP tb SEP 20 SEP 90 SEP 40 tb Comparative SEP compound SEP 13 SEP 0 tb Non treated SEP SEP 0 SEP 0 SEP tb It is clear from the foregoing description that the novel pyrazoline compounds of this invention have high insecticidal activity and a broad insecticidal spectrum.
