# Storage battery construction.

## Abstract
A storage battery, particularly adapted for automotive applications, includes unique cover, venting and terminal constructions which, in their various embodiments, can accommodate virtually any automobile cable arrangement. Each of the several embodiments utilizes an identical con tainer 10 , electrode construction, intercell assembly and venting arrangement. Various types of exterior battery termi nals 39 , accommodating both conventional pressure clamps and threaded connectors, are connected to the battery elec trodes through an intermediate primary cover 31 . An outer secondary cover 43 encloses the entire top of the battery, except for direct access to the exterior terminals 39 , and the venting assembly is totally enclosed between the primary 31 and secondary covers 43 .
