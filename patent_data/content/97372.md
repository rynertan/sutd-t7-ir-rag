# Fast breeder nuclear reactor.

## Abstract
A fast breeder has a driver core region 12 enrached with a fissile material and a blanket core region 15 containing mainly a fertile material. The driver core region 12 includes an inner core region 13 and an outer core region 14 surrounding the inner core region. The volume of the inner core region 13 is selected to range between 30 and 70 of the volume of the driver core region 12 . The enhancement of the fissile material in the inner core region 13 ranges between 30 and 80 of the fissile material in the outer core region 14 .
