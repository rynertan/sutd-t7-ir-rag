# Granulation.

## Abstract
In particulate compositions, it is advantageous to seek to match the physical properties such as particle size and density of the components and in particular it is desirable to modify the physical properties of magnesium salts of various percarboxylic acid carboxylates for example particular mag nesium monoperoxyphthalate, that have been produced in the processes described in European Patent Specification 27693 and unpublished British Patent Application 8117841, for subsequent incorporation in detergent and or bleaching compositions. In the present invention, granules of the magnesium salts are obtained by spraying onto agitated feed particles of the salt a small amount of a dilute aqueous solution of a synthetic poly hydroxy substituted compound, particularly polyvinylalcohol and drying the resultant agglomerate. It is especially suitable to carry out the granulation process in a warm air fluidised bed using feed particles of mainly below 200 microns producing eventually a low bulk density product mainly in the range 200 1000 microns. In a modification of the fluidised bed process, the agglomerating agent used can be a aqueous solution of carboxylated polyvinyl alcohol.
