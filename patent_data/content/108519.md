# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR FRACTURING ROCK

## Abstract
A method of fracturing rock includes the steps of drilling a hole into the rock required to be fractured, modifying the shape of the hole, and rapidly pressurizing the modified hole to initiate and propagate cracking to a free surface of the rock. Apparatus for accomplishing the method includes two variations of apparatus for allowing very rapid injection of a pressurized liquid into a hole.
