# Fluid piston device.

## Abstract
A fluid piston device in which a piston 22 is axially movable in a cylinder 12 to provide first and second chambers 28,30 , a piston rod extending through the second chamber 30 . The piston is provided with through passages 44 which allow bi directional flow of fluid so that the piston can move rapidly when under light load. As soon as a heavy load is encountered, increased pressure in the first chamber will close a valve 52 to shut off passages 44 whereby the piston can operate under a heavy load. The valve is normally held open by a spring 76 but is closed when pressure in the first chamber 28 , relative to a fixed, usually atmospheric pressure, high enough to overcome the spring to close the valve.

## Description
DESCRIPTIONTITLE FLUID PISTON DEVICE This invention relates to a fluid piston device of the differential circuit pressure operated type which exerts an extending force at a rapid or slower rate, depending upon applied load. Fluid operated piston devices are commonly used to convert fluid energy into mechanical energy in many industrial applications such as clamping, press and die stamping operations. In many such applications, a relatively low resisting load is initially applied to the piston through its piston rod during the power stroke so that the pressurized fluid conducted to the cylinder housing is supplied at a constant rate with low inlet pressure to produce uniform travel of the piston until it encounters a higher resisting load near the end of the power stroke. At that point, the piston continues its travel to the end of the power stroke at the same rate under an increased inlet pressure of the fluid supplied at the same inflow rate.Accordingly, the piston device and its fluid supply system must be designed to meet maximum load conditions regardless of the relative intervals of time during which maximum load is applied to the piston. A considerable waste of fluid and energy is therefore involved. In order to meet different load conditions, various complex arrangements leave been devised, often applied to the fluid supply system to vary the inlet pressure and inflow rate of fluid to the cylinder housing enclosing the piston.Controls have also been devised to change the operational mode of the piston device by conducting uni directional external by pass flow passages from the chamber formed on one side of the cylinder to that on the other. Complex modifications of the piston and cylinder structure have also been proposed creating a plurality of additional pressure chambers and piston pressure faces to modify the operational mode of the piston device. According to the present invention there is provided a fluid piston device comprising a cylinder, a piston axially movable within the cylinder and dividing it into a first pressure chamber and a second pressure chamber, a piston rod extending from said piston through the second chamber, a source of pressurized fluid, means for selectively conducting fluid from said source to the first chamber, at least one passage extending through the piston for conducting bi directional flow of fluid through said piston between the chambers during the relatively rapid travel of the piston under a load resisting movement of the piston1 which is less than a predetermined value, a pressure responsive valve biased by fluid pressure in the first chamber towards a closed position to restrict said flow between said chambers, responsive to an increased load, a vent to give a constant reference pressure to the pressure responsive valve, independent of fluid in said chambers, a spring urging the pressure responsive valve to an open position until overcome by the fluid pressure in the first chamber, when the load resisting movement of the piston exceeds said predetermined value, and a relief valve connected to the second chamber for unloading pressurized fluid from the second chamber during relatively slow travel of said piston under a resisting load exceeding said predetermined value. Such a construction will automatically change its operational mode to meet an increase in loading during travel in one direction. This is achieved with a less complex modification of the piston and cylinder structure as compared to prior art arrangements and without complex controls in the fluid supply system associated therewith and permits positioning of the piston device by an external force with a minimum of fluid resistance. In a particular embodiment of the invention it is possible to have the piston retractable by a reversed pressurized fluid flow to permit exertion of a force in the opposite direction. In order that the invention will more readily be understood, the following description is given, merely by way of example, reference being made to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a longitudinal section view through one embodiment of device according to the present invention Figure 2 is a section taken along line 2 2 inFigure 1 Figures 3, 4 and 5 are schematic illustrations of the piston device shown in Figure 1 together with its associated fluid supply system, in three operational modes Figures 6, 7 and 8 are schematic illustrations similar to Figure 3 showing three different modified fluid supply systems and controls Figure 8A is an enlarged sectional view of a detail of the valve illustrated in Figure 8 Figure 9 is a partial section view showing a modification of the piston device shown in Figure 1 Figure 10 is a longitudinal section view through a second embodiment of the invention which is double acting Figure 11 is a view taken along line 11 11 inFigure 10 and Figures 12,13,14 and 15 are schematic illustrations of the double acting piston device of Figure 10, together with an associated fluid supply system show in four different operational modes. Referring now to the drawings in detail, Figure 1 illustrates a fluid power operated piston device 10 which includes a pressure sealed cylinder housing 12 having an elongate cylindrical wall portion 14 and end wall blocks 16 and 18, held thereon by elongate bolt assemblies 20 to form a pressure sealed cylindrical chamber within which a piston 22 is slidably displaceable. Static seals 24 prevent leakage of pressurized fluid from the cylindrical chamber while the piston 22 and piston rings 26 divide the housing into opposing pressure chambers 28 and 30. A piston rod 32 is threaded on to the piston 22 and extends through the pressure chamber 30 and a central opening 34 in the end wall block 18 to engage an external load. A slide bearing 38 is received within the opening 34 and is provided with a seal in wiping engagement with the piston rod 32.An inlet passage 40 in end wall block 16 enables pressurized fluid to be supplied to or exhausted from chamber 28, while an outlet passage 42 in end wall block 18 communicates with the central opening 34 to allow for outflow of fluid from chamber 30. Several bi direction by pass flow passages 44 are formed in the piston 22 and may extend in diverging relationship from the upper face 46 to the lower face 48 of the piston. Mounted on the piston 22 within the chamber 28 is a piston valve assembly 50 into which the by pass flow passages 44 open. The piston valve assembly 50 includes a circular valve disc 52 having upper and lower pressure faces 54 and 56. A valve stem 58 is connected by means of a pin 60 to extend from the lower surface 56 of valve disc 52, so that the effective area of the valve face 54 is larger than that of the valve face 56, the fluid pressure acting on the differential area tending to displace the valve disc into engagement with an annular valve seat element 62. This element is sealed relative to the piston face 46 and to the by pass flow passages 44 by an annular seal 64.The valve seat element 62 is held assembled on the piston by means of a plurality of fastener bolts 66 that extend from a stop disc portion 70 and radial spacing legs 72 of retainer cap 68, through the valve seat 62 and into threaded engagement with the piston. Passages 74 are accordingly formed between the spacing legs 72 Figure 2 to establish fluid communication between the by pass passages 44 and the inlet pressure chamber 28, when the valve assembly 50 is in its open position with pressure face 54 abutting the stop disc 70 see Figure 1 . The valve disc 52 is biased to this open position by means of a compression spring 76 housed within a cylindrical cavity 78 formed in the piston rod 32. The cavity 78 slidingly receives the valve stem 58 which is in wiping engagement with a moving seal 80 carried by the threaded end portion of the piston rod. The spring cavity 78 is vented to atmosphere in the embodiment illustrated in Figure 1 through a vent passage 82 extending longitudinally through the piston rod from the cavity 78. Because cavity 78 is vented to atmosphere, a constant pressure, namely atmospheric pressure, is applied against the valve stem 58, this providing a constant reference base against which all trigger signals controlling the dynamic actions of the components are biased, including a reference base for the foregoing bias. Without the reference base pressure provided by the vent, consistent sequential operation of the device to be described would not take place. As shown in Figure 3, fluid under pressure from a suitable pressure source such as pump 84 is conducted through a three port selector valve 86 to the inlet pressure chamber 28 at the beginning of a power stroke. The valve disc 52 being held in its open position under the bias of spring 76 permits bi directional flow through passages 44 so that both pressure chambers 28 and 30 will be pressurized at substantially equal pressures. Since the area of face 46 is larger than the area of face 48, this will cause travel of piston 22, the travel being at a relatively high speed, because the fluid can flow through passages 44 at a rate substantially higher than that of the inflow rate of fluid into inlet pressure chamber 28 through supply conduit 88 from the selector valve 86.Rapid travel of the piston will continue until the piston rod 32 meets a relatively higher resisting load, whereupon the pressure of the fluid in chambers 28 and 30 increases to a level at which the differential closing force on the valve disc 52, resulting from the fluid pressure acting on the different areas of valve disc 52, overcomes the bias of spring 76 causing the valve disc to seat as shown in Figure 4. The by pass passages 44 will then be substantially blocked so that travel of the piston 22 will continue at a lower speed because chamber 28 continues to expand only at a rate determined by the low inflow rate of fluid from supply conduit 88.Fluid from the contracting chamber 30 is exhausted to vented sump 92 through a relief valve 90 that is opened in response to the change to the higher pressure. If provision is made, by any known mechanism or signal device, to ensure complete opening of relief valve 90 when piston rod 32 encounters maximum load and maximum pressure exists in chamber 28, the maximum force is exerted against the load. Figure 8 illustrates this system by utilizing a two position, two way valve 91 which can by pass relief valve 90. Valve 91 is controlled by a pilot pressure signal obtained from cylinder supply line 88. Valve 91 is fully illustrated in Figure 8A, so that its construction and operation is readily apparent to one skilled in the art. When the selector valve 86, as shown in Figure 5, is displaced to its other operative position, inlet pressure chamber 28 will then be connected to sump 92 and valve assembly 50 open itself. The piston 22 may then be easily displaced in either direction by an external force applied to the piston rod. Figure 6 illustrates a modified form of piston device 10 with which a similar fluid supply system is associated including the pump 84, sump 92, selector valve 86, and relief valve 90, as to that described with respect to Figures 3,4 and 5. The piston device itself is also similar except that the vent passage 82 is connected through a flexible conduit 94 to the outlet port of an overruling valve 96 having two inlet ports respectively connected to the pump outlet and sump 92. In one position of the valve 96, the vent passage 82 will be connected to sump 92 and will therefore function as before. However, when the valve 96 is displaced to the overrule position shown in Figure 6, pressurized control fluid from pump 84 will be supplied to the spring cavity through the vent passage 82 and thereby hold or lock the piston valve 50 in its open position as shown.The piston valve will therefore remain open despite any closing forces ordinarily caused by a rise in pressure in inlet chamber 28. The valve 96 may either be displaced manually or by some external signal to its other operative position to permit closing of the piston valve or automatically displaced to its other operative position by some piston position responsive mechanism. The embodiment of Figure 3 could be further modified as shown in Figure 7 by utilizing a four way three position control valve 87, to permit similar cylinder action as shown in Figures 3,4 and 5, but have the added feature of being able to rapidly open the piston valve 50 at the completion of its power stroke, especially when the piston rod 32 is opposed by a spring type resilient load which is attempting to displace the piston rod and piston 22 backwards. In Figures 3,4 and 5, fluid cannot enter chamber 30 immediately following the power stroke since relief valve 90 is uni directional away from chamber 30 and piston valve 50 is held closed due to the partial vacuum in chamber 30 caused by the abovementioned resilient load applied to piston rod 32.Under similar circumstances, the embodiment in Figure 7 can break this vacuum in chamber 30 by momentarily shifting control valve 87, thus connecting fluid pressure to chamber 30 and venting chamber 28 to the sump 92. This momentary flow of fluid would force open piston valve 50 and permit the device to enter the free motion mode when control valve 87 is shifted to its centre position. Figure 9 illustrates a modified embodiment of the invention which eliminates the vent passage 82 through the piston rod 32. Figure 9 shows piston 22 connected to a piston rod 32 modified so as to have a chamber 98 formed therein housing a flexible gas filled container 100 having at least one closed cell. Any compressible gas at atmospheric pressure is suitable. The exterior of container 100 is in fluid communication through passage vent 102 with spring cavity 104 within which compression spring 76 is enclosed exerting a continuous bias force on valve stem 58 thus holding valve 50 open. The flexible container 100 filled with gas at atmospheric pressure permits the operation of piston valve 50 by compressing to a reduced volume when valve stem 58 is forced into cavity 104 with the closing of piston valve 50.This flexible gas filled container 100 eliminates the eventual filling of chamber 98 with non compessible fluid which would impair the operation of valve assembly 50. The closed cell gas filled container 100 as with the constructions of Figures 3,4,5,7 and 8 where spring chamber 76 is vented to true atmosphere by means of vent passage 82 to provide a reference pressure. Figure 10 to 15 show a modified device in which like parts have been indicated by like reference numerals increased by 100. Piston valve 150 is similar to the valve device 50, but permits the piston to operate with a force in two directions, and therefore is considered a double acting piston. Piston 122 is constructed similarly to piston 22 and has ports 144 together with surface 148 in juxtaposition to chamber 130. Piston 122 has valve seat element 162 mounted thereon together with a retainer cap 168. Valve disc 152 has pressure faces 154 and 156 adjacent to valve chambers 155 and 153 respectively. Retainer cap 168 is constructed similar to retainer cap 68 including a stop disc portion 170 from which a plurality of spacing legs 172 extend into engagement with valve seat 162 and providing passages 174 between the spacing legs 172, as more clearly seen in Figure 11, to provide free fluid communication between chamber 130 and chamber 128 when valve assembly 150 is in its open position. However, a check valve 161 and ring seal 173 are added. Valve disc 152 is slightly modified in that it has a sealing communication with inner faces 175 of retainer cap 168. Ring seals 173 are located in wall 175 to ensure sealing engagement between valve disc 152 and retainer 168. As more clearly seen in Figure 13, when valve disc 152 is in the position for extending piston rod 132, there is sealing engagement between face 156 and valve seat element 162 to prevent any flow of fluid between chambers 128 and 130. Retainer cap 168 includes the addition of a valve 161 which may be of the ball seat or the spool type. The valve 161 is mounted in retainer cap 168 having port and valve seat 163 in the portion thereof adjacent to chamber 128. Ball valve member 165 is held against port seat 163 by a low force spring 167 mounted within chamber 169.Chamber 169 communicates with valve chamber 155 through port 171. Check valve 161 permits only uni directional flow from chamber 128 to chamber 155 unless it is displaced by an adjustable boss 157 mounted on end block 116. The double acting modification of Figures 10 15 operates similarly to the single acting configuration in that the fluid supply consists of a fluid sump and pump and the basic control circuit consists of two three way, two position fluid valves and a pressure relief valve. The rapid extension mode must begin with piston valve assembly 150 open to permit flow from chamber 130 to chamber 128. Supply of pressurized fluid to chamber 128 through port 188 by three way valve 186 initiates the rapid extension mode. The three way valve 191 connects port 142 to the pressure relief valve 190, as seen primarily inFigures 12 to 15. In this position, the piston rod 132 is extending in the rapid extension mode with fluid flowing unrestrictedly from chamber 130 to chamber 128. This action will continue until piston rod 132 encounters an increased resistive force such that spring 176 is overpowered7 thereby permitting valve disc 152, as before, to seat against valve seat 162 and stop any fluid flow through piston 122.The increase of pressure in chambers 128 and 130 is also effected in chamber 155 on the upper portion of valve disc 152 since valve 161 permits essentially free flow from chamber 128 to chamber 155. Since the fluid flow from chamber 128 to chamber 155 is essentially unrestricted, the operation of this modification is identical in this respect to the operation of the single acting embodiment in the rapid extension mode and the power extension mode. The piston rod retraction mode of operation commences when both control valves 186 and 191 are shifted in position such that fluid is supplied under pressure to chamber 130 and leaves chamber 128 through port 188 to flow to sump 192. The flow from chamber 128 to sump 192 occurs because no flow is permitted through piston 122 since fluid trapped in chamber 155 locks the valve disc 152 sealingly tight against valve seat 162. The fluid is trapped in chamber 155 because of annular seal 173 between retainer cap 168 and valve disc 152, as well as the sealing of valve 161 prevent fluid flow from chamber 155 to chamber 128.This is accomplished because the pressure in chamber 155 together with the force exerted by spring 176 forces ball 165 against seat and port 163. The force which piston 132 can apply to the retraction external load equals the fluid pressure in chamber 130 acting upon the piston surface 148. The termination of the retraction mode by fluid power is accomplished when piston 122 reaches the back end of its stroke and control valve 191 has been shifted, thereby preventing all fluid under pressure from being supplied to the cylinder. The boss 157 extending from the end block 116 displaces ball valve 165 from seat 163, thereby permitting fluid to flow between chamber 155 and chamber 1284 thus permitting fluid trapped in chamber 155 to escape to chamber 128 as spring 176 pushes the disc valve 152 away from its valve seat 162 and reduces the size of chamber 155. The fluid in chamber 128 is permitted to flow to the sump 192 by control valve 186. At this point in the operation, the piston valve assembly 150 is open and the cylinder is in the free motion mode, that is, it is free to be moved in either direction by an external force applied to the piston rod 132. Valve 186 is then shifted changing to the rapid extension mode by connecting chamber 128 to supply pressure while valve 191 is already in the position connecting chamber 130 through relief valve 190 to sump 192.
