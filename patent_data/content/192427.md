# Polymerisation in several stages of alpha olefins in the gas phase.

## Abstract
A process and apparatus as shown in Figure 1 for the production of polyolefins by the polymerisation of alpha olefins in the gas phase, in several stages, in at least two polymerisation reactors interconnected by a transfer device making it possible to transfer the polyolefins resulting from the first reactor into the second reactor, in which the polymerisation is continued under conditions identical to or different from those of the first reactor.
