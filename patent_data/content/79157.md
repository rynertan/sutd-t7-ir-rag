# Process for esterifying fluorinated carboxylic acid polymer.

## Abstract
A process for preparing a fluorinated polymer having carboxylic ester groups from a corresponding polymer having carboxylic acid groups is disclosed, wherein the polymer having carboxylic acid groups is treated with a selected ortho ester, acetal, ketal, borate ester or sulfite ester. The process is useful for assuring that all of the carboxylate groups of a polymer are in the ester form before an extrusion or lamination procedure, both of which are performed with heat and pressure, so as to preclude decarboxylation of free carboxylic acid groups during such procedure.
