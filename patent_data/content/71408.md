# Diaphragm assembly.

## Abstract
A peripheral portion of a diaphragm 12 is clamped between respective clamping surfaces of clamping members 17, 23 by means of a band, 33 which embraces the clamping members. An abutment 40 on one of the clamping members establishes a predetermined positional relation between the clamping members. In the fully tight ened condition of the band, the pressure between the diaphragm and the clamping surfaces of the clamping members is independant of the tension in the band.
