# Apparatus for sealing the skirt of a converter waste gas recovery system.

## Abstract
An apparatus for sealing the skirt 2 of a converter 1 waste gas recovery system is disclosed, which includes an annular flange 21 that is mounted about the outside surface of the converter 1 adjacent to its mouth 15 at a point clear outside the reach of the molten slag and metal that might spill over the rim 23 of the converter mouth 15 during the pro cess of blasting. An annular sealing band 17 is provided at the lower peripheral portion of the skirt 2 , which runs sur rounding the mouth 15 . The annular sealing band 17 is divided into multiple arcuate segments of a whole bandage, each pivotally disposed on a horizontal pin 20 and connected to a separate hydraulic cylinder 18 through its axially mov able piston rod. It is so designed that the segments of the annular sealing band 17 are individually yet simultaneously swung about their respective pins 20 by their hydraulic cylin ders 18 into abutting contact with the external periphery of the flange 21 providing a tight leakproof seal. In the con tacted surfaces of the annular sealing band 17 and the flange 21 , sealing is most unlikely impaired by clumps of solidified slag and metal spilled in molten state from the converter mouth 15 as in the skirts 2 of conventional waste gas recovery systems.
