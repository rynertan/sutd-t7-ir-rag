# Ultrasonic transducers for medical diagnostic examinations.

## Abstract
An ultrasonic transducer 10 for medical diagnostic exami nations which comprises at least one transducer element 14 having one surface through which ultrasonic waves are emitted, an acoustic impedance matcher 17 , and a contact member 18 which in use is brought to contact with an object being examined and is formed on the one surtace of the ultrasonic transducer element 14 . The contact member 18 includes at least one flat plate or an acoustic lens made of a 4 methylpentene 1 polymer which has high mechanical strength. Transducer arrays and assemblies A using such polymer as a member for direct contact with a human body are also described.
