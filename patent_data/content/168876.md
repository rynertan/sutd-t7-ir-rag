## Description
PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF CARBOXYLIC ACID ESTERS OF HYDROXY SULFONATES The invention relates to the preparation of carboxylic acid esters of hydroxy sulfonates by a carbonylation process. Carboxylic acid esters of hydroxy sulfonates are compounds which may be used as surface active agents or as bleach activators in detergent compositions. It is known to prepare these compounds by reacting hydroxy sulfonates with carboxylic acids employing conventional esterification methods. European Patent Application No. 83201237.1 PublicationNo. 0106379 is concerned with a process for the carbonylation of olefins in the presence of water, an alcohol or a carboxylic acid using a catalyst comprising a palladium compound, at least 5 mol of a triaryl phosphine per gram atom of palladium and an acid having a pKa 2 at 18 C in aqueous solution , except hydrohalogenic and carboxylic acids, as promotor. The reaction products are carboxylic acids, esters or carboxylic acid anhydrides. Thus, methylpropionate may be prepared by carbonylation of ethylene in the presence of methanol. It has now been found that carboxylic acid esters of hydroxy sulfonates can be prepared by carbonylation of olefins in the presence of hydroxy sulfonates and an aromatic reaction medium using the catalytic system of European Patent ApplicationNo. 83201237.1 Publication No. 0106379 . In these aromatic media the carboxylic acid esters of hydroxy sulfonates.can be obtained in the form of a slurry or suspension, thereby allowing easy recovery of the homogeneous catalyst system. The invention therefore relates to a process for the preparation of carboxylic acid esters of hydroxy sulfonates in which an olefinically unsaturated compound is carbonylated with carbon monoxide in the presence of an aromatic hydrocarbon reaction medium, a hydroxy sulfonate of the general formula I HO R SO3M, whereinR represents a divalent optionally substituted hydrocarbon group and M represents a metal of Group I and II of the Periodic Table of the Elements, a palladium catalyst., at least 5 mol of a phosphine of the general formula 11 PR1R2R3 wherein R1, R2 and R3 each represent an optionally substituted aryl group, per gram atom of palladium and as promotor an acid having a pKa 2, except hydrohalogenic and carboxylic acids. The olefinically unsaturated compound which can be carbonylated according to the invention may be an unsubstituted or a substituted alkene or cycloalkene preferably having 2 30, and in particular 2 20, carbon atoms and Dreferably 1 3 double bonds. The alkene or cycloalkene may be substituted, for instance, with one or more halogen atoms or cyano, ester, alkoxy, hydroxy, carboxy or aryl groups. If the substituents are not inert under the reaction conditions, the carbonylation reaction may be accompanied with other reactions. For instance, the carbonylation of a hydroxy group containing alkene is accompanied with esterification of the hydroxy group.Examples of suitable olefinic compounds are ethene, propene, butene l, butene 2, isobutene, the isomeric pentenes, hexenes, octenes and dodecenes, such as 2 methylbutene 1, 3 methylbutene l, 3,3 dimethylbutene l, 3 methylpentene 1, 3,3 dimethylpentene 1, 2,4,4 trimethylpentene l, 2, 5 dimethylhexene 1 and 2 ethylhexene l, cyclooctadiene 1,5 , cyclododecene, cyclcododecatriene 1,5,9 , allyl alcohol, methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, acrylnitrile, acrylamide, N,N dimethyl acrylamide, vinyl chloride, allyl chloride, acrolein, oleic acid, methyl allyl ether and styrene. The hydroxy sulfonates of the general formula I HO R SO3M to be used in the process of the invention are those in which R represents a divalent hydrocarbon group containing preferably not more than 20 carbon atoms. The hydrocarbon group may be aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic and may be substituted with one or more substituents, such as mentioned hereinbefore in connection with the olefinically unsaturated compounds to be used as starting material.The symbol M of the general formula I may represent a metal ofGroup I and II of the Periodic Table of the Elements such as Na, K,Cs, Ca, Mg, Cu or Zn. Preferably M represents the alkali metals Na or K. Examples of suitable hydroxy sulfonates are sodium or potassium salts of 2 hydroxyethanesulfonic acid, 3 hydroxypropanesulfonic acid, 3 hydroxybutanesulfonic acid, 4 hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid, 2 hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid, 4 hydroxy 3methylbenzenesulfonic acid, 4 hydroxy 2,6 dimethylbenzenesulfonic acid, 5 hydroxy 3 methyl2 propylbenzenesulfonic acid, 4 hydroxy 3 methoxybenzenesulfonic acid, 5 hydroxy 4 methoxy 2 methylbenzenesulfonic acid, 2 hydroxy 6nonylbenzenesulfonic acid and 2,4 dihydroxybenzenesulfonic acid.The use of hydroxy sulfonates of the general formula I, wherein R represents a phenylene group is preferred. Palladium catalysts suitable to be used in the process according to the invention are the salts of palladium with, for instance, nitric acid, sulphuric acid or alkane carboxylic acids having not more than 12 carbon atoms. Salts of hydrohalogenic acids may, in principle, be used as well, but are not preferred because they tend to counteract the effect of the promotor as defined hereinafter. A catalyst used by preference is palladium acetate. Moreover, palladium complexes may be used, for instance palladium acetylacetonate, tetrakistriphenylphosphinepalladium, bis tri o tolylphosphinepalladium acetate or bis triphenylphosphinepalladium sulphate. The quantity of palladium catalyst may vary within wide ranges.Preference is given to the use of quantities in the range between 10 5 and 10 1 gram atom palladium per mol of olefinically unsaturated compound. The substituted or unsubstituted aryl groups R1, R2 and R3 of the phosphine PR1R2R3 preferably contain not more than 18, in particular 6 14, carbon atoms. Examples of suitable R1, R2 and R3 groups are the naphthyl group and in particular the phenyl group.Suitable substituents are halogen atoms and alkyl, aryl, alkoxy, carboxy, carbaloxy, acyl, trihalogenmethyl, cyano, dialkylamino, sulphonylalkyl and alkanoyloxy groups. Examples of suitable phosphines are tri p tolylphosphine, trip methoxyphenylphosphine, o diphenylphosphinobenzoic acid and in particular triphenylphosphine. The phoshine is used in a quantity of at least 5 mol, preferably at least 10 mol per gram atom of palladium. If the palladium catalyst already contains phosphine, this should be taken into account when calculating the amount of phosphine to be used. The acids used as promotors in the process according to the invention preferably have a non coordinating anion, by which is meant that little or no co valent interaction takes place between the palladium and the anion. Typical examples of such anions are PF6 , SbF6 , BF4 and C104 . Acids preferably used are, for instance, sulphonic acids and those acids that can be formed, possibly in situ, by interaction of a Lewis acid such as, for example, BF3, AsF5, SbF5, PFg, TaF5 orNbF5 with a Broensted acid such as, for example, a hydrohalogenic acid, in particular HF, fluorosulfonic, phosphoric acid or sulfuric acid. Specific examples of the last named type of acids are fluorosilicic acid, HBF4, HPF6 and HSbF6. Typical sulfonic acids that can be used are fluorosulfonic acid, chlorosulfonic acid and the sulfonic acids specified hereinafter. A preferred group of acids has the general formulaEMI4.1 wherein X represents sulfur or chlorine and, if X is chlorine, R4 represents oxygen and if X is sulfur, R4 represents an OH group or an optionally substituted hydrocarbon group. When the afore mentioned acids are used in the process according to the invention, the anions of the acids can be regarded as non coordinating. In the acids having the general formula III, the optionally substituted hydrocarbon group, represented by R4, is preferably an alkyl, aryl, aralkyl or alkaryl group with 1 30, in particular 1 14, carbon atoms. The hydrocarbon group may be substituted with for instance halogen atoms, in particular fluorine atoms, hydroxy groups or acyl groups. Examples of suitable acids of the general formulaIII are perchloric acid, sulfuric acid, 2 hydroxypropane 2 sulfonic acid, p toluene sulfonic acid and trifluoromethane sulfonic acid. Further suitable sulfonic acid promotors are the hydroxy sulfonic acids and the carboxylic esters thereof corresponding respectively with the hydroxy sulfonates used as starting material and the carboxylic esters obtained as product in the process such as for instance 4 nonanoylbenzenesulfonic acid and 4 3,5,5 trimethylhexanoyl benzenesulfonic acid. The use of acids of the general formula III wherein X represents sulfur is preferred. The quantity of the acid with a PKa 2 present in the reaction mixture is preferably 0.01 150, more particularly 0.1 100, and most preferably 1 50 equivalents per gram atom of palladium. The acid can optionally be formed in situ, for example by hydrolysis of an ester, for instance such as an alkyl ester of a sulfonic acid, or by reacting a ketone with SO2 and water. The carbonylation of the olefinically unsaturated compounds should be carried out in the presence both of the phosphine mentioned and the acid as hereinbefore defined, preferably in a ratio of at least 2 mol phosphine per equivalent acid with pKa 2. In the carbonylation according to the invention the presence of small quantities 0.01 to 0.4 mol per mol of olefin of carboxylic acids in the reaction mixture can be tolerated. The process of the invention is carried out using an aromatic hydrocarbon as reaction medium. Examples of suitable aromatic hydrocarbons are benzene, toluene, o , m or p xylene, ethylbenzene, pentylbenzene, mesitylene, chlorobenzene, cumene, anisole and diphenyl ethers. In the process according to the invention the carbon monoxide may be used pure or diluted with an inert gas, such as nitrogen, noble gases or carbon dioxide. The presence of hydrogen in amounts of up to 20 v is not detrimental to the carbonylation reaction.Preference is given to the use of carbon monoxide or a carbon monoxide containing gas which contains 0.05 to 20 v of hydrogen. The process according to the. invention is preferably carried out at a temperature in the range between 50 and 200 C, in particular between 80 and 1600C. The overall pressure preferably lies between 50 and 75 bar gauge. The molar ratio of the olefinically unsaturated compound to the hydroxy sulfonate may lie between 0.1 1 and 10 1, excess of olefinic double bonds, with the molar rato lying between 1.1 1 and 5 1, being preferred. The process according to the invention may be carried out batchwise, continuously or semi continuously. Because of the easy separation of solid reaction products from the liquid reaction medium comprising the homogeneous catalytic system the process is particularly suitable for continuous operation.Example I A 250 ml magnetically stirred Hastelloy C autoclave Hastelloy is a trade mark was charged with 100 ml toluene, 250 mmol octene l, 75 mmol sodium 4 hydroxybenzene sulfonate, 0.2 mmol palladium acetate, 40 mmol triphenylphosphine, 8 mmol sulfuric acid and 22 mmol nonanoic acid. The used sodium 4 hydroxybenzene sulfonate had been dried by azeotropic distillation with toluene. The autoclave was flushed with carbon monoxide, filled with carbon monoxide at a pressure of 50 bar, sealed and heated to a temperature of 140 C. After a reaction time of 16 hours the slurry obtained was filtrated.The filtrated solid product was washed with toluene and dried. The dried product was analyzed by C13 NMR in aqueous solution yielding the composition of the product in mol. The solid product appeared to consist exclusively of the produced carboxylic acid esters and unreacted sodium 4 hydroxybenzene sulfonate. The total amount of carboxylic acid esters in mol gives the conversion of sodium 4 hydroxybenzene sulfonate to the esters in mol. In addition the reaction was carried out analogously in furtherExperiments 2 6. The data and results of the Experiments 1 6 are given in Table I. In Experiment 5 0.8 mmol Pd acetate were employed in place of 0.2 mmol. In Experiment 6 1.3 mmol Pd acetate, 150 mmol sodium 4 hydroxybenzene sulfonate and 150 ml cumene were employed in place of 0.8 mmol Pd acetate, 75 mmol sodium 4 hydroxybenzene sulfonate and 100 ml toluene.
