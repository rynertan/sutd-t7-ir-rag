# Method and device for varying a D.C. voltage connected to an electrostatic dust separator.

## Abstract
A method and device for varying a d.c. voltage con nected to an electrostatic dust separator so as to render more effective in return for a low consumption of energy the collection of dust on an electrode or electrodes incorporated in the dust separator. The d.c. voltage is set to a first level basic level , said level having superimposed on it a number, in each case two or more, of voltage pulses forming a pulse group, with the consecutive pulse groups being separated from each other chronologically and supplied to electrodes incorporated in the dust separator. A pulse generating device is so arranged as to generate a number of pulses making up a pulse group, whereby the first pulse 21 in said pulse group is selected so as to exhibit an amplitude and or a duration and or a form such that, when the pulse is supplied to the dust separator, it will not cause flash over but will produce an increase in the inclination to flash over 20 of the dust separator, in conjunction with which the immediate ly following pulse 22 in the pulse group is selected so as to exhibit an amplitude and or a duration and or a form such that, when the pulse is supplied to the dust separator, it will not cause flash over in spite of the increased inclination to flash over 20 caused by the preceding pulse, and so on.
