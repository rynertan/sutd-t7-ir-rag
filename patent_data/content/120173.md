# Diffuser for gas turbine engine.

## Abstract
A diffuser system for a gas turbine engine includes a prediffuser and a piping system that diverts the flow into two streams. One stream captures the prediffuser discharge air at the center of the gas path where the total pressure is at its highest level and provides an additional stage of diffusing before dumping it around the burner to supply liner cooling air, turbine cooling air and if necessary, small amounts of dilution air to trim radial temperature profile. The other stream is ducted directly into the burner avoiding the typical dump diffuser losses.
