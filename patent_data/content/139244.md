# Magnetic recording medium.

## Abstract
This disclosure concerns a magnetic recording medium characterized in that a substrate of said magnetic recording medium is coated thereon with a mixture which is substan tially composed of a hexagonal system ferrite magnetic powder having an average particle diameter of 0.2 Âµm or less and a bonder resin having an active hydrogen equivalent of 2000 or more. The magnetic recording medium according to this invention does not occur any flocculation of the hexagonal system ferrite magnetic powder and has excellent dispersion properties and perpendicular orientation ability. Further, smoothness on the coating film are also good, and S N properties are noticeably improved.
