## Description
DESCRIPTION The present invention relates to vending machines and has particular reference to a vending machine of the kind comprising a cup magazine, a cup dispensing station remote from said cup magazine, cup transport means for transporting a cup along a cup path from said magazine to said dispensing station and control means for controlling a supply of cups from a magazine and for controlling said transport means, hereinafter referred to as of the kind described . In machines of this type, it is essential to provide a periodic indication as to the position of a cup prior to proceeding with, for example, a dispensing operation. In the event of a cup not being present in the dispense operation, then the dispense operation could proceed in the absence of a cup thereby injecting ingredients into the body of the machine itself with the attendent mess involved. In order to avoid this, it has been the practice of vending machine manufacturers to position a microswitch at various positions along the cup path to ensure the correct positioning of a cup prior to initiation of the dispense operation. In this way unwanted dispense operations whether of solid ingredients or of makeup liquid such, for example, as water have been avoided. The disadvantage of microswitches, however, is that their life is dependant upon a number of times in which the device is used. Thus a microswitch controlled device with intensive use may last a comparatively short period whereas one with only occasional use will last for a much longer period. Vending machines are employed in a variety of environments some of which are intensively used and others which are only occasionally used. According to the present invention, there is provided a vending machine of the kind described for use in combination with a disposable cup having a generally reflective outer surface said machine including at least one radiation transmitter and sensor whereby the sensor is adapted to receive radiation reflected from the external surface of the cup within the machine, the arrangement being such that if no positive indication of cup presence is received in the correct control sequence of the control means then the control means is disenabled to prevent further function of the machine until the deficiency has been rectified. In a particular embodiment of the present invention there is provided a vending machine of the kind described including at least one cup sense means disposed along said cup path, said cup sense means comprising a transmitter adapted to direct electromagnetic radiation towards a cup location and a receiver adapted to receive radiation reflected from a cup located at said location said receiver being operatively connected with the control means so that when the transmitter is operated without radiation being detected by said receiver the control means is disenabled. In a particular embodiment of the present invention the cup magazine may comprise a cup turret with associated cup dropper adapted to receive a stack of cups and dispense a cup into a cup carriage.The cup sense means in accordance with the present invention may be disposed juxtaposed the cup carriage to detect the presence or absence of a cup in the carriage prior to the commencement of a dispense operation. In a further embodiment of the present invention, a cup sense means may also be provided juxtaposed the cup dispensing station to sense the presence of a cup whereby in the event of a positive indication a control means is disenabled to the extent of preventing the commencement of a dispense cycle of the machine while the cup remains in position. In another embodiment of the present invention the vending machine includes an access door at the cup dispensing station, means for locking the door in a closed position in the absence of a cup, and sense means juxtaposed said cup position at the dispense station arranged to sense the presence of a cup to enable or disenable the door locking means accordingly. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the radiation transmitter and the radiation receiver may be located in one sense head juxtaposed the cup position to be sensed. Following is a description by way of example only and with reference to the accompanying drawings of methods of carrying the invention into effect. In the drawings Figures 1 a and 1 b are diagrams partly in section, of parts of a dispensing machine in accordance with the present invention. Figure 2 is a detail of the control circuitry of the sense heads employed in accordance with the invention. Figure 3 is a rear view of the machine of Figure 1. Turning now to the apparatus of Figure 1, a cup magazine 10 comprises a turret 11 rotatable about a vertical axis. and having a plurality of locations each capable of accommodating a stack 12 of cups, lowermost a cup 13 of which is disposed in a cup dropper of known configuration. Juxtaposed the cup dropper, there is provided a cup conveyor 14 comprising a track 15 and a carriage 16 having a cup receiving arm 17. The carriage 16 is moved by a conveyor tape 18 driven by motor means not shown and controlled by a micro processor control means. The conveyor tape 18 is arranged to transport carriage 16 along track 15 passed a plurality of ingredient dispense positions 20. At the end of the cup path defined by the conveyor track, there is provided a cup dispensing station 21 at which the cup 13 is disengaged from arm 17 to be presented on a base 22 for collection by consumer.The dispense station 21 is protected by means of an access door 23 which is moved between an open position in which access can be gained to the cup in a closed position in which the cup at the dispensing station 21 is isolated from the surroundings. The door 23 is controlled by means of a solenoid lock not shown operatively interconnective with the microprocessor control means. Juxtaposed the datum position of cup arm 17 beneath the cup dropper, there is provided a sense head 24 comprising an infrared transmitter and an infrared receiver. The cup stack 12 is formed of cups each having a substantially reflective outer surface such, for example, as white plastic. A similar sense head 25 is provided in the dispense station beneath base 22. A further sense head 26 may be juxtaposed by the cup stack juxtaposed the cup dropper. Each of the sense heads 24, 25 and 26 may be operatively connected with the microprocessor so that on sensing the present or absence of tie cup as is appropriate the controlled means for the conveyor is disenabled to prevent further operation by the machine until the fault is remedied. The sensing circuit is disclosed in figure 2 and comprises an emitter 30 and a photoelectric cell 31 the photoelectirc cell being connected by a trigger 32 so that when radiation is received by cell 31 trigger 32 is red operative to render trigger output 33 high to give a positive indication when the object is present. The detector 26 used in the cup turret system is such that when the level of cups fulls below the sensor the drive motor of the turret will be caused to operate until cups from other tubes fill the dispensing stack to a level such that the sensor stops the motor when the receiver or photo cell detects reflected radiation. The microprossor provides a time over ride control to ensure that the turret 11 completes at least one rotation before indicating cups sold out and inhibiting the next vend until the turret has been at least partly replenished. It will be apppreciated that devices employed in accordance with the applicants present invention constitutes a direct replacement for microswitches which require their levers to be in physical contact with the cup edges or other components. The sensors in accordance with the present invention require no physical contact with the object, i.e. the cup, and do not, therefore, contribute to feed jams in the cup supply system.
