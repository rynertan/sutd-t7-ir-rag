# X RAY TUBE HAVING A UNITARY TARGET, STEM AND ROTOR HUB

## Abstract
An x ray tube target element in which a target disk portion, a stem portion and a base portion are integral. The elements are composed. alternatively, of metals frequently used for target disks alone or of graphite. A layer of an alloy, such as tungsten rhenium, disposed circularly on a face of the target disk substrate constitutes the focal track of the target. The base of the element is adapted for coupling it directly to the anode rotor assembly.
