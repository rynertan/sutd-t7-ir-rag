# Controlled differential.

## Abstract
A differential assembly 10 includes a casing 12 , a carrier 14 , a planetary gear set 18 supported by the carrier 14 for effecting rotation of the carrier, an input 20 for driving the planetary gear set to effect rotation of the carrier 14 , pinion means 42, 44 supported by the carrier for rotation therewith, a pair of side gears 38, 40 meshing with the pinion means and first and second outputs 34, 36 driven by the side gears. A clutch means 50 having an actuated condition for retarding relative rotation of the side gear 40 with respect to the carrier 14 is provided. The planetary gear set 18 is operable to actuate the clutch means 50 upon axial movement of the planetary pins 26 to retard relative rotation of one of the side gears 38, 40 and the carrier 14 upon the occurrence of a predetermined condi tion.
