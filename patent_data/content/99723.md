# Coaxial cable.

## Abstract
Significantly enhanced bending characteristics are pro vided in a coaxial cable by reducing the stiffness of the tubular sheath 14 in relation to the stiffness of the core 10 . The cable comprises a core 10 including at least one inner conductor 11 and a low loss dielectric 12 surrounding the inner conductor 11 , and an electrically and mechanically continuous tubular metallic sheath 14 closely surrounding the core 10 and being adhesively bonded thereto, the ratio of the stiffness of the core 10 to the stiffness of the tubular sheath 14 being greater than 5.
