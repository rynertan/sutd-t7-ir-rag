# Apparatus for supplying headed parts.

## Abstract
An apparatus for supplying headed parts from a hopper 23 to a chute 9 has a pickup or scooper blade 5 movable by an actuator mechanism 4, 6, 7, 8 between a first position in which a second groove 5A in the pick up blade 5 is out of alignment with a first groove 9A in the chute 9 and a second position in which the first and second grooves 5A, 9A are aligned with each other to allow headed parts as scooped from the hopper 23 by the pickup blade 5 to be fed in a row from the pickup blade to the chute 9 . A rejector in the form of a bent wire is operatively connected to the hopper or chute and slidable along the second groove as the pickup blade approaches the second position to remove off the groove headed parts from the pickup blade to permit smooth supply of neatly arranged headed parts from the pickup blade to the chute.
