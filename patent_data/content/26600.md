## Description
REFLECTIVE SAFETY BELT This Invention relates to a reflective safety belt for personal wear which is particularly, but not exclusively, suitable for wear by persons likely to be exposed to situations in which they are at risk of injury and accident from other people or machines due to poor visibility. Such safety belts are, for example, suitable for wear by motorcycle or cycle riders to increase the likelihood of the wearer being visible by other road users in poor visibility conditions. However, such safety belts are also suitable for use in other dangerous situations of poor visibility such as in factories by people exposed to travelling cranes, on railways by repair personnel working on the railway lines and on roads, airports or construction sites by maintenance or construction personnel. To this end such safety belts must render the wearer easily visibie in poor visibility conditions both in day time and at night time. The belts therefore are made of material which is fluorescent for enhancing daytime visibility and retro reflective for enhancing night time visibility.Whatever the material used such belts generally have an elongated striplike waist portion for removable attachment around the waist of the user and an elongated strip like portion, fixed by its ends to the waist portion at two regions thereof, for removable attachment over the shoulder of a user. As in general only ol.e surface of the belt portions, namely the outer surface thereof in use, is made retro reflective and fluorescent, it is necessary to attach the strap portion to the waist portion in a manner such as not to interfere with the retro reflective and fluorescent capabilities of the belt. In general this is done by fixing the strap portion at its ends to the under surface of the waist portion. However, this method of fixing the strap portion to the waist portion renders the belt weak at the fixture region particularly at the junction points between the strap and waist portion adjoining edges and in use of the belt the strap portion is likely to be torn away from the waist portion at these junctions. This weakness is particularly enhanced when using heat welded belt portions made from a plastics laminated fabric with a woven backing, due to a tendency for the backing to separate from the plastics laminate under stress applied along the line of the edge of the waist portion at these junction points. There is thus a need for a generally improved reflective safety belt for personal wear constructed to minimise this risk of tearing at the junctions due to stress exerted in use on the belt at these junctions. According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a reflective safety belt for personal wear having an elongated portion for removable attachment around the waist of a user and an elongated strap portion, fixed by its ends to the waist portion at two regions thereof, for removable attachment over the shoulder of a user, which portions are made of flexible retro reflective and fluorescent sheet material, wherein the waist portion has a part provided with at least one margin projecting externally of the waist portion part from a general edge line thereof, which margin forms one of the fixture regions for the strap portion and is so shaped to form with the respective end of the strap portion fixed thereto, a rounded or radiussed edge at each junction between the strap portion and waist portion part adjoining edges in order to minimise stress at these junctions and thereby reduce the likelihood of tearing of the strap portion or waist portion part at these junctions. Preferably the at least one margin is integral with the waist portion part and is shaped from the piece of material forming the waist portion part. Advantageously the waist portion part provides two such margins spaced from one another at a distance sufficient for one such margin to provide the front fixture region for the shoulder strap portion and for the other such margin to provide the rear fixture region for the shoulder strap portion, on the waist portion of the belt. Preferably the waist portion part providing the or each margin is made from sheet material wider than the remainder of the waist portion to which it is attached in any convenient manner such as by heat welding. The shoulder strap portion can be attached at its ends to the rear surface of the or each respective margin in any convenient manner such as by heat welding thereto. Advantageously the shoulder strap portion end is attached to the rear surface of the margin so as to form with the margin a double thickness of material at the rounded or radiussed edge junction between the strap portion and waist portion along the general edge line of the waist portion. The waist portion of the belt is provided with means whereby the belt may be attached to and removed from the waist of a user, such as a clasp. buckle or Velcro Trade Mark fixing means. Preferably means are provided on one or other or both of the waist portion and strap portion to enable the length thereof to be adjusted to suit the requirements of a user of the belt. Advantageously the belt is made from flexible retroreflective and fluorescent sheet material providing both night time reflec tion and daytime fluorescent properties. Conveniently such material is a polyethylene polyester laminated fabric having a fluorescent reflective surface provided with an array of reflective projecting cube corner prisms such as the so called Firemans Tape or high intensity fabric made by Reflexite Corporation of America or 3M s. For a better understanding of the present invention and to show how the same may be carried into effect reference will now be made by way of example to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a plan view of a reflective safety belt according to one embodiment of the invention taken from the front thereof, and Figure 2 is a plan view of a waist portion part for use with the belt of Figure 1. Referring now to the accompanying drawings a reflective safety belt according to a first embodiment of the invention as shown in Figure 1 basically has an elongated waist portion 1 for removable attachment around the waist of a user and an elongated strap portion 2, fixed by its ends to the waist portion at two regions 3 thereof, for removable attachment over the shoulder of a user. These portions 1 and 2 are made of flexible retro reflective and fluorescent sheet material of any suitable form which can provide daytime fluorescent action and night time retroreflective action. A suitable material is made from polyethylenepolyester laminated fabric with a preferably woven backing with cube corner prisms embossed in or on the plastics laminate. These prisms provide the desired reflective action and the fluorescence is provided by the plastics material itself. Suitable sheet materials of this nature are made by Reflexive Corporation of America under the name FiremansTape or high intensity fabric or by 3 M s. As shown in Figure 1 of the drawings the strap portion 2 preferably is a diagonal strap fixed at its ends to the waist portion 1. To this end the waist portion 1 has a part 4 provided with at least one margin 5 projecting externally of the waist portion part 4 from a general edge line 6 thereof. In the view shown in Figure 1 the margin 5 forms a iixture region for the front end of the strap portion 2. In order to provide a satisfactory fixture of the end of the shoulder strap portion 2 to the waist portion 1 conventional belts have used rivets.These rivets have not been entirely satisfactory as they have provided points of stress or weakness at which the shoulder strap portion can be torn from the waist portion in use of the belt. Alternative conventional belts have attempted to avoid this problem by overlapping the shoulder portion end and waist portion and welding the overlapped regions together with the shoulder strap end behind the waist portion. As with a diagonal form of shoulder strap belt construction it has been necessary for the shoulder portion to meet the waist portion at an angle at the fixture region this has resulted in the waist portion making an acute angled junction with one edge of the shoulder strap portion.The resulting sharp angled junction between the waist portion and shoulder strap portion has formed a point of weakness at which the waist portion and shoulder strap portion can readily be torn apart in use of the belt. The weakening effect of the angled junction between the waist portion and shoulder strap portion have been enhanced in such a conventional heat welded belt by making the waist portion and shoulder strap portion of the same width material. Thus such heat welded conventional belts have also proved unsatisfactory in use. In order to minimise stress at junctions between the strap portion and waist portion part in the first embodiment of the present invention the margin 5 is so shaped to form with the strap portion fixed thereto, a rounded or radiussed edge 7 at each junction between the strap portion 2 and the waist portion part 4 adjoining edges. These rounded edges 7 at the junctions reduce the likelihood of tearing of the strap portion 2 and waist portion part 4 at these junctions. As can be seen from Figure 1 the waist portion part 4 preferably is made of sheet material which initially is wider than the sheet material of the shoulder strap portion 2 and the sheet material forming the remainder of the waist portion 1. In this way the projecting margin 5 can be formed by cutting the waist portion part 4 to provide the necessary rounded edges 7.Alternatively, if desired, the waist portion part 4 can be made of material of similar width to that of the remainder of the waist portion 1 or of the shoulder strap portion 2, and the projecting margin 5 can be made from a separate sheet of material, shaped to provide the requisite rounded or radiussed edges 7 and attached, such as by heat welding, to the appropriate region of the waist portion part 4. However, as can be seen from Figure 1, when the rounded edges 7 are provided on the waist portion part 4 such rounded edges have the effect of removing the sharp angled junction found on conventional heat welded belts et the shoulder strap portion and the waist portion part. By replacing the conventional sharp angled junction between the shoulder strap portion and waist portion part adjoining edges with the rounded edges. 7 it is possible to minimise stress at these junctions and thereby to reduce the likelihood of tearing of the shoulder strap portion 2 or the waist portion part 4 at these junctions. Preferably two such margins 5 are provided on the second waist portion part 4 at a sufficient distance apart to provide the necessary fixtures regions for both the front and rear ends of the shoulder strap portion 2. Such a waist portion part 4 is shown in Figure 2. As can be seen from Figure 2 the waist portion part 4 is attached to the remainder of the waist portion 1 at 8 in any convenient manner for example by being overlapped with the remaining part of the waist portion 1 and heat welded thereto. The other end of the waist portion part 4 is provided with a buckle part 9 in any convenient manner adapted to mate with a corresponding buckle part 10 provided in any convenient manner on the remaining free end of the waist portion 1.Any suitable form of clasp or buckle can be used for providing a releasable connection between the ends of the waist portion 1 and as a alternative such releasable connection may be by means of Velcro Trade Mark portions not shown. If desired means may be provided on whe shoulder strap portion 2 and or the waist portion 1 whereby the length of these portions can be adjusted to suit the requirements of a user of the belt. Preferably these adjustment means are in the form of simple slides such as shown at 11 on Figure 1. Heat welded conventional belts have also had a tendency for the plastics laminate of the shoulder strap portion to become separated from its fabric backing at the junction line between this strap portion and the waist portion. This failure tendency has been enhanced by the fact that at the junction line, which lies along the general upper edge line of the waist portion, stress exerted on the junction acts along the upper edge line of the waist portion on effectively a single layer of material provided by the shoulder strap portion. On the contrary with reflective safety belts according to the invention the provisions of a margin 5 with radiussed edge 7 projecting externally of the general edge line 6 of the waist portion part 4, ensures that stress acting along the general edge line 6 acts both on a radiussed edge 7 and on effectively a double thickness of material provided by the joined together portions 2 and 4. The radiussed edge 7 and the double thickness of material act both as a reinforcement and stress resistor at the junction and thus reduce the rendency for the material of the portion 2 to separate at the junction between the portions 2 and 4. In effect the point of stress application is removed to a line away from the line the top edge of the waist portion part 4 makes with the portion 2.
