# A slicing machine.

## Abstract
A slicing machine comprises a blade 1, feed means 8, 9, 11, 12 to feed a product 7, typically a food product, towards the blade 1, and means including a conveyor 14 downstream of the blade 1 to form groups of slices. The machine also includes a programmed computer 18 to control the feed rate of the feed means 8, 9, 11, 12 and control the means 14 to form groups of slices 13. The programmed computer 18 is prog rammed to calculate the optimum number of slices and thick ness of the slices forming each group in dependence upon physical parameters of the product 7 and to control the feed rate of the feed means 8, 9, 11, 12 andthe means 14 to form the groups so that the slices in each group are of optimum thick ness and there are the optimum number of slices in each group.
