# Telecommunication system, in particular telephone system.

## Abstract
The system comprises a plurality of intercoupled sub systems D5 . Each sub system D5 comprises a control unit MCU and at least one peripheral module PM to which communication lines can be connected. A problem involved is that when establishing a connection between two termin als T connected through the communication lines to the system a large number of data has frequently to be passed from and to the terminals. The data management becomes more effective and more economic with the control unit MCU of each sub system D5 comprises a list of numbers inside the system and that on the basis of a number of a desired destination connected to a communication line provided by a source connected to a communication line it is determined to which sub system D5 the destination is associated. When the destination sub system is a system differing from the source sub system, the required signalling information about the identity and characteristic of the source is transmitted to the control unit MCU of the destination sub system, whilst the connection is passed on to the destination sub system. The control unit of the destination sub system then analyses said information and establishes the connection, as the case may be.
