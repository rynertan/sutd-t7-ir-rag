## Description
Production of Ethers The present invention relates to the production of ethers especially tertiary alkyl ethers. It is known to produce ethers by reacting olefins and alcohols in the presence of suitable catalysts. For example, tertiary alkyl ethers may be prepared by reacting a tertiary olefin and an alcohol, e.g. isobutene and methanol to give methyl t butyl ether, in the presence of catalysts such as mineral acids, e.g. sulphuric acid, and a range of solid catalysts such as heteropolytungstic or molybdic acids doped with phosphorus or boron, acidified alumina, and various acidified ion exchange resins. The use of mineral acid catalysts can give rise to corrosion problems which make it difficult to apply such catalysts on a commercial scale. Commercial processes are known using acidified ion exchange catalysts, especially for the production of methyl t butyl ether, which is particularly useful as a gasoline additive with high octane properties, but such catalysts often have poor thermal stability and this limits the reaction temperature which can be used, e.g. in many cases reaction temperatures not in excess of 800C. The use of lower reaction temperatures can in turn result in long reaction times and low throughput per unit volume of reaction vessel. Another problem which can arise with known processes is the formation of dialkyl ether by products deriving from the alcohol used. Polish Patent No. 103379 describes a method of making methyl t butyl ether by reacting methanol and isobutene in the presence of a catalyst comprising zeoliteX or Y or a partially dealuminated, modified or ionexchanged form thereof, the process being carried out in a vapour or liquid phase. Using zeolite Y in a vapour phase process at 1200C, a liquid product is obtained consisting of 8.1 methyl t butyl ether and 91.8 methanol.the same zeolite is used in a liquid phase process at 160 C and a pressure of 31 atmospheres and a partially dealuminated zeolite Y is used at 1250C andia pressure of 23 atmospheres. According to US Patent No. 2882244, zeolite X has a silica alumina ratio in the range 2 3 and according toUS Patent No 3130007, zeolite Y has a silica alumina ratio in the range 3 6. We have now found that tertiary alkyl ethers may be prepared from tertiary olefins and alcohols in the presence of certain zeolite catalysts under milder conditions than are described in the Polish patent, conditions which allow the production of the tertiary alkyl ethers at high selectivity and in good yield, with low yields of undesirable by product dialkyl ethers and oligomers of the olefin. According to the present invention we provide a process for the production of an ether which comprises contacting an olefin and an alcohol. with a catalyst comprising a zeolite having an X02 Y203 ratio equal to or greater than 10, wherein X is silicon and or germanium, and Y is one or more of aluminium, iron, chromium, vanadium, molybdenum, arsenic, manganese, gallium or boron, the zeolite being predominantly in the hydrogen form. The said zeolites have acid sites within zeolite pore systems active in the catalysis of tertiary aLkyl ether formation. The entry port size in the preferred zeolites is such that reactants and products can move into and out of the pore systems, i.e. with a LennardJones diameter a A of from about 5.0 to 8.0 A the Leonard Jones diameter o A is defined by D W Breck in Zeolite Molecular Sieves , Wiley Interscience, 1947, page 636 . The preferred zeolites for use as catalyst are based on X02 as silica SiO2 and Y203 as alumina A1203 .Suitable zeolites which may be employed as catalysts in the process of the invention include Zeolite beta US 3308069 ZSM 5 US 3702886 EPA 0011362 ZSM 8 German OLS 2049755 ZSM 1l US 3709979 ZSM 12 US 4086186 EPA 0013630 ZSM 23 US 4076842 ZSM 35 US 4016245 ZSM 43 EPA 0001695 ZSM 48 EPA 0015132 FU 1 UK 1563346 FU 9 UK Appln. 8040781 Nu 2 UK Appln. 8040782 Nu 4 UK Appln. 8115407 Nu 5 UK Appln. 8040395 Nu 6 2 UK Appln. 8039685 Nu 10 UK Appln. 8115410 EU 1 European Appln. 81302343.9 EU 2 GB 2077709A Zeolite omega UK 1178186 Zeolite phi German OLS 2513682 The zeolites may be converted to their hydrogen form by methods which have been fully described in the prior art, for example by calcination of the as made zeolite and subsequent acid exchange.If desired, the zeolites may be ion exchanged or impregnated so as to comprise cations or oxides. selected from the following,Cu, Ag, Mg, Ca, Sr, Zn, Cd, B, Al, Sn, Pb, V, P, Sb, Cr,Mo, W, Mn, Re, Fe, Co, Ni, noble metals and lanthanides.The formation of olefin oligomers may be further inhibited by treating the zeolite with a bulky organic base, for example phenanthridine. It is believed that the base neutralises the surface acidic sites whilst being unable, because of its bulk, to enter the pore system of the zeolite. Suitable olefins for use in the process of the invention include mono or di olefins containing from 4 16 carbon atoms, especially 4 to 9 carbon atoms, e.g.isobutene, 2 methylbut 1 ene, 2 methylbut 2 ene, 2 methylpent l ene, 2 methylpent 2 ene, 3 methylpent 2ene, 2 methylhex 1 ene, 2 methylhept l ene and 2 methyloct l ene, or mixtures thereof. Suitable alcohols for use in the process of the invention include primary and secondary alkanols containing from 1 to 12. carbon atoms, more preferably containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, e.g. methanol, ethanol, n propanol, iso propanol, and n butanol. Also included are ether alcohols, e.g. RO CH2CH20 nH where R is H or hydrocarbyl and n is 1 20, e.g. 2 methoxyethanol. The process of the invention is particularly applicable to the production of tertiary alkyl ethers containing a total of. 5 to 10 carbon atoms from the corresponding tertiary olefins and alcohols, and especially to the production of methyl t butyl ether from isobutene and methanol. The preferred zeolite catalysts for use in the production of MTBE are zeolites Nu 2., Nu 4, Nu 10 and beta. The etherification reaction may be carried out in the vapour or liquid phase. The liquid phase reaction is typically carried out in a stirred and heated pressure vessel containing the reactants and catalyst. In the gas phase, the reactants may conveniently be passed through a heated tubular reactor containing the catalyst. This process readily lends itself to continuous production of the ether product. The liquid phase and vapour phase processes may suitably be carried out at a temperature in the range from 0 C to 200 C, preferably in the range from 50 C to 1100C, for example7O0C to. 1000C. The reaction is normally conducted. under atmospheric or superatmospheric pressure, e.g. at a pressure in the range 1 to 100 bars. The molar. ratio of the olefin to alcohol may vary widely but is suitably in the range from 0.5 to 5.0 moles of alkanol per mole of olefin. For the liquid phase process, the. proportion of catalyst in the reaction mixture may vary within very broad limits, but is suitably within the range from about 0.1 to about 5 . by weight. Under conditions suitable for the reaction of an alkanol and an olefin to yield tertiary alkyl ethers selectively, the zeolite catalyst is remarkably stable and does not itself suffer damage from degradation reactions which give materials having poor catalytic activity. By virtue of its nature,a zeolite can be rapidly recovered from the reaction mixture in liquid phase processes and can be reused in further batch operations. Zeolites for use in the process of the invention, and methods for their preparation, have been described in the patent specifications referred to above. Inasmuch as some of these patent specifications are as yet unpublished, further details of zeolites Nu 2, Nu 4, Nu 5,Nu 6, Nu 10, EU 1, EU 2 and FU 9 are provided below.
