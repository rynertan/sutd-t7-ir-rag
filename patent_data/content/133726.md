# Video translation system for translating a binary coded data signal into a video signal and vice versa.

## Abstract
The binary coded data signal is divided into data blocks in the video translation system in accordance with the invention. n copies are made of each data block. Television synchronization signals are added to the original data block and to the n copies thereof, the assembly thus forming a video data block. This video data block is transferred to a video processing device, for example, a video recorder in which it is recorded. When the video data block is recovered, the corresponding data block is recovered from the n 1 data blocks present.
