# Lampassembly.

## Abstract
To facilitate production of a variety of lamp assemblies using a reduced amount of tooling, a lamp assembly is formed of a first reflector body 10 having an internal reflective surface 12 and at least one second reflector body 11 having an internal reflective surface 18 which are secured together by rivets 24 rather than being moulded together to form a particular design of lamp assembly. Complementary frusto conical bosses 15 and recesses 23 are formed at one side of the respective bodies, as are complementary stepped portions 16, 21 , in order to ensure that the bodies 10 and 11 are secured together with the reflective surface 12 and 18 in the required mutual disposi tion.
