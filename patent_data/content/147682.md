## Description
NOVEL AMINO ACID INFUSION SOLUTIONThe present invention relates to a novel amino acid infusion solution suitable for administration to convalescents, especially postoperative patients.Heretofore, known amino acid infusion solutions are based on the oral nutritional requirement for example, 1 an amino acid infusion solution based on necessary amounts for essential amino acids determined by Rose et al, 2 FAO pattern in 1957, 3 amino acid infusion solution based on the composition of amino acids in human milk or whole egg determined by FAO WHO in 1965, etc. , or are based on the pattern of free amino acids in normal plasma. In practice, amino acid infusion solutions are intravenously administered to postoperative patients so that they are not controlled by the digestive tract and, therefore, it is assumed that the optimum composition would be different from those described above.In recent years, surgical trauma has been further investigated physiologically and biochemically. It has thus been known that the level of free amino acids is greatly distorted particularly in serum and that after an operation a specific aminogram appears in response to catabolism in view of the nutritional physiology. It is therefore desired that the composition of an amino acid infusion solution effective for the postoperative state be a composition which corresponds to the necessary amounts of amino acids whose level has been changed in response to the diseased living body and normalizes the in vivo amino acid pool.Accordingly, the present inventors made extensive investigations with an attempt to develop a novel amino acid infusion solution capable of preventing the catabolism of body proteins and of maintaining the body proteins at a normal level in the state of trauma, using as an index the degree of normalization of the free amino acid pattern in plasma.As a result, the present inventors have accomplished the present invention.During the process of the investigations, the composition of an amino acid infusion solution which can normalize the altered plasma amino acid pattern in the postoperative state was experimentally determined and the composition for use in rats was translated into the composition for use in human, considering differences in plasma amino acid pattern between humans and rats and further considering the similarity regarding the tendency of the change of respective amino acid levels in the postoperative state. Thus the composition H 5 Takami et al,Japanese Patent Application OPI 38127 81 was developped.The H 5 composition was administered to patients with moderate surgical trauma under intravenous hyperalimentation and, the plasma amino acid pattern and the nitrogen balance were compared with the case in which a known amino acid preparation according to Vuj N formulation was administered. As the result, the degree of normalizing the plasma amino acid pattern in the postoperative state was higher and the balance of nitrogen was better in the case of administering the H 5 composition, as compared to the Vuj N formulation. When administering the H 5 composition, however, an increased level of L valine and L tryptophan in the plasma amino acid level and a decreased L lysine level cause problems which leave room for an improvement.In particular for L valine a certain correlation has been found between the dose and the concentration in plasma and accordingly, the L valine dose was modified so as to give a normal level. Further, the range of L lysine was also examined it has been found that the degree of normalizing the serum amino acid pattern can be improved and an excellent nutritional effect can be exhibited when the relative proportion of L valine L lysine is kept in the range of 4.0 to 1.1 as molar ratio .The amino acid infusion solution of the present invention which has been accomplished based on the above described findings is characterized by comprising at least the following amino acids in the following compositional range Amino Acid Composition g 100 g of total amino acids in the table L Isoleucine 8.5 10.0 L Leucine 12.0 14.0 L Lysine 5.0 9.0 L Methionine 3.0 5.0 L Phenylalanine 6.0 8.0 L Threonine 6.0 8.0 L Tryptophan 1.0 2.0 L Valine 8.0 16.0 L Cystine O 0.3 L Tyrosine 0.2 0.5L Alanine 5.0 10.0L Arginine 8.0 12.0L Aspartic acid 0 1.0L Glutamic acid 0 1.0Glycine 5.0 10.0L Histidine 3.0 6.0L Proline 3.0 6.0L Serine 1.0 3.0In case one or more of the above stated optional components L Cystine, L Aspartic acid and L Glutamic acid is or are present, the preferred lower limit for the amount of these optional components is 0.01 g per 100 g of total amino acids of the composition.In the amino acid infusion solutions having the stated composition L Cystine may be partially or wholly replaced by cysteine. Further methionine and or tyrosine may be partially or wholly replaced by phenyl alanine.The amino acid infusion solution of the present invention has a pH ranging from 5.0 to 7.8, preferably 6.5 to 7.5.As a pH controlling agent, organic acids, for example, acetic acid, malic acid, etc. may be used. The concentration of the amino acids is not particularly limited but determined depending upon the specific use , for example, for uses, such as infusion solution in the central vein, infusion solution in the peripheral blood vessel, etc. It is, however, preferred that the concentration be approximately 5 to 12 t. The amino acids used in the present invention may be used either as free acids or in the form of a salt, such as metals salts, e.g., sodium salt, potassium salt, etc. mineral acid salts, e.g., sulfate, hydrochloride, etc. organic acid salts, e.g., malate, etc. Further the amino acid infusion solution of the present invention may additionally contain electrolytes, vitamins and other additives known for conventional amino acid infusion solutions. The amino acid infusion solution may fu furcher contain stabilizers, pH controlling agents, etc. required for preparation of the infusion solution.The amino acid infusion solution of the present invention may be prepared without any difficulty and any process for preparing known amino acid infusion solutions is applicable. Hereafter, the present invention will be described more in detail, referring to the following examples.Example 1Each of the amino acids is dissolved in distilled water for use in injection as shown the table below. After the pH of the resulting aqueous solution of the amino acids is adjusted to about neutrality, bacteriae are removed by filtration. Then, the solution is charged in a vial or a plastic bag. After substituting the air with nitrogen, the vial or bottle is plugged and sterilized by heating in a conventional manner to prepare the intended amino acid infusion solution.
