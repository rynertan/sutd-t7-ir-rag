## Description
pat.appln.nr. 83.200409.7 Rotor cabin part of a divisible cabin for use in a windmill. The invention relates to a rotor cabin part releasably arranged in a divisible cabin for use in a windmill provided with a horizontal rotor shaft, particularly for generating electricity, said rotor cabin part comprising, apart from the rotor shaft, a gear wheel drive coupled with said rotor shaft and having an output shaft for driving the generator, a turning motor and lubricating oil pump connected with the gear wheel drive and, in the case of adjustable rotor blades, the associated blade setting mechanism as well as control means. It is known to design such a rotor cabin part in the form of a self supporting construction, on which are mounted the stools for the rotor shaft bearings, the gear box and various further mechanisms, apparatus and duct systems. In order to ensure satisfactory alignment of, in particular, the rotor shaft and the gear box, the fastening surfaces have to be precisely machined, which involves additional costs in the manufacture, whilst, moreover, mounting requires highskill and the mounting operation is time consuming. Because all parts of the rotor shaft, bearing and the gear box itself to be mounted have to satisfy strength and rigidity requirements, which also applies to the cabin construction, the weight of the cabin with the mechanisms accomodated therein is fairly heavy. The invention has for its object to eliminate the inconveniences of the prior art construction. According to the invention this is achieved in that a housing of the gear wheel drive and the rotor shaft is integrally arranged in the self supporting rotor cabin part. The rotor cabin part is preferably constructed in the form of a largely hollow truncated cone having at the base an annular flange and a wall at the top of an inwardly directed, cylindrical rotor bearing housing and internally at least tne transverse support, for example, a transverse partition integral with the integrated gear wheel drive housing. Such a construction is rigid and has a light weight and it eliminates aligning problems in mounting thanks to the fixed relative orientation of the rotor bearing housing and the gear wheel drive housing. In order to permit of mounting internal parts of the mechanisms the rotor cabin part is preferable divided in the longitudinal direction into two parts.The two parts are located with relatively fitting flanges in a plane going through the rotor axis and fastened to one another by means of bolts. The conical wall of the rotor cabin part is prefe rably provided on the outside with stiffening ribs, which have the additional function of cooling vanes for cooling the lubricating oil contained in the rotor cabin part. On the outer side of the wall forming the base of the frustoconical rotor cabin part are preferably mounted the turning motor, the lubricating oil pump and the drive of the blade setting mechanism. Therefore, these small components are readily accessible from the interior of the cabin for inspection as the case may be, for local replacement. The frequency of disengage.2nts of the rotor cabin part is thus limited. The aforesaid and further features of the invention will become apparent in the following description with reference to a drawing. The drawing shows in Fig. 1 a side elevation of a windmill embodying the invention, Fig. 2 an enlarged, fragmentary, exploded side elevation of a detail II of Fig. 1, Fig. 3 an enlarged side elevation and partly a sectional view of detail III of Fig. 1, Fig. 4 a sectional view taken on the line IV IV inFig. 3, Fig. 5 an elevational view in the direction of the arrows V in Fig. 3, Fig. 6 a sectional view taken on the line VI VI inFig. 3, Fig. 7 an enlarged side elevation and partly a sectional view of detail VII of Fig. 3, and Fig. 8 a side elevation corresponding to Fig. 3 of a variant of the mechanism shown in Fig. 3.

On an outer face 26, 37 of the rotor cabin part 8 and the generator screening hood 9 and on a generator housing 28 of the generator 28 are provided tackle fastening means formed by tackling eyelets 39 andlll. A hoisting cord of the hoisting implement can be fastened to the tackling eyelets 39 orlll in order to remove the rotor cabin part 8, the generator screening hood 9 or the generator 28 from the stationary cabin part 7. The bolts 29 fastening the rotor cabin part 8 to the stationary cabin part 7 can be manipulated from within the cabin 6 and are screwed through holes 101 in a centering flange 102 of the stationary cabin part 7 into tapped holes 30 of the wall 22 of the rotor cabin part 8. The rotor cabin part 8 and the mechanisms 18, 19, 20 surrounded by the rotor cabin part 8 can be removed together by a single manipulation with the aid of the hoisting implement from the stationary cabin part 7, after in order of succession the hoisting cord of the hoisting implement is fastened to the eyelets 39 of the rotor cabin part 8, the coupling 33 is loosened from within the cabin 6 and the bolts 29 fastening the rotor cabin part 8 to the stationary cabin part 7 are unscrewed. The bolts 42 fastening the generator screening hood 9 to the stationary cabin part 7 can be manipulated from within the cabin 6 and are screwed through holes 103 in a flange 104 of the stationary cabin part 7 into tapped holes 105 of a flange 106 of the generator screening hood 9.

The bolts 115 fastening the generator 28 to the stationary cabin part 7 are screwed through holes 107 in a centering flange structure 117 of the carrying frame 100 of the stationary cabin part 7 into tapped holes 108 of a flange 109 of the generator 28. When the generator screening hood 9 is removed from the stationary cabin part 7, the generator 28 can be removed with the aid of the hoisting implement from the stationary cabin part 7 after, in order of succession, the hoisting cord of the hoisting implement is fastened to the eyelet 111 of the generator housing 38, the coupling 34 is loosened from within the cabin 6, the bolts 115 are unscrewed from within the cabin 6 and the generator 28 is slipped out of the carrying frame 100 in which it is accomodated with sliding fit. The rotor cabin part 8 and the mechanisms 18, 19, 20 surrounded by the rotor cabin part 8 constitute an integral unit which is detachably connected on the one hand with the stationary cabin part 7 on the other hand with one another.Furthermore the generator hood 9 and the mechanism 28 surrounded by the generator hood 9 are detachably connected each with the stationary cabin part 7 and with one another. The rotor cabin part 8 of the cabin 6 of the windmill 1 comprises the cabinet 21, the rotor bearing housing 25 and the gear wheel drive housing 27. The rotor bearing housing 25 and the gear wheel drive housing 27 are accomodated in the cabinet 21, the diverging jacket 24 of which forms a wall 24 of the gear wheel drive housing 27 Fig. 3 . In a longitudinal plane bounded by the rotor axis 41 are undetachably connected parts of the diverging jacket 24, parts of the gear wheel drive housing 27 and parts of the rotor bearing housing 27 and are associated with one and the same monolith 43. The cabinet 21, the rotor bearing housing 25 and the gear wheel drive housing 27 constitute an integral unit. This integral unit is divisible in the direction of the rotor axis 41 into two monoitthicparts 44 and 45 Figs. 4 and 5 .The monolithic parts 44, 45 are fastened to one another by fastening means comprising bolts 46 and nuts 47. By means of additional gear wheels 125 and auxiliary output shafts 48 auxiliary mechanisms, for example, a turning motor 49 and a lubricating oil pump 50 are coupled with the rotor shaft 18 by means of the gear wheel drive 19. A frame 15 for the auxiliary mechanisms 49 and 50 is detachably fastened to the wall 22 of the cabinet 21 of the rotor cabin parts8. The lubricating oil pump 50 supplied through oil ducts 52 the lubricating oil 57 to the bearings 53 to 56 the oil being collected below in the cabinet 21. The outer face 36 of the diverging jacket 24 is provided with cooling vanes 58 for cooling the lubricating oil 57 contained in the cabinet 21. The cooling vanes 58 provided on the outer face 36 of the diverging jacket 24 serve in addition as stiffening vanes. The cabin 6 is self supporting and derives the required rigidity from its shape. The blade setting mechanism 20 for adjusting rotor blades 61 of the mill rotor 26, which is rotatably journalled by means of its rotor shaft 18 on the rotor cabin part 8 of the cabin 6 of the windmill 1 is passed through the hollow rotor shaft. The blade setting mechanism 20 comprises a rotation motor for example, an electric motor 63 fed from a source of energy 62 and setting means comprising a spindle shaft 64 coupling the electric motor 63 with the rotor blades 61. The spindle shaft 64 is journalled by means of a bearing 112 in the hollow rotor shaft and is rigidly connected at one end with the output shaft of a reducing gear box on the electric motor 63. At the other end the spindle shaft is in engagement by means of a worm 71 with a gland 68, which is displaceable in an axial direction in the hollow rotor shaft 18 and guarded against rotation and which is furthermore connected through a rod system 69 with the consoles 78 on the collar 59 of the rotor blades 61 rotatably journalled in the rotor hub 121. Between the spindle shaft 64 and the rotor shaft 18 is arranged an electro magnetic coupling 65 and on the shaft 67 of the driving motor 63 an electro magnetic brake 66. Setting of the rotor blades 16 occurs when the spindle shaft 64 has a speed of rotation differing from that of the rotor shaft in a manner such that, when the spindle shaft 64 rotates in the same direction more rapidly than the rotor shaft 18, the rotor blades 61 are adjusted from the vane position and, when the spindle shaft 64 rotates more slowly, adjustment takes place towards the vane position. When during the operation of the windmill 1 no blade setting is needed, the spindle shaft 64 is fixedly coupled with the rotor shaft 18 by means of the electro magnetic coupling 65, whilst the electro magnetic brake 66 is not operative and the electric motor 63 is not energized.If during operation the rotor blades 61 have to be adjusted, the electro magnetic coupling 65 as well as the electro magnetic brake 66 are inoperative and the electric motor 63 is energized in order to attain the number of revolutions required for the adjustment. The electric motor 63 can be driven with at least two speeds, a high speed so that the spindle shaft 64 assumed a rotary speed equal to that of the rotor shaft 18 at the maximum permissible operative rotor speed and a low speed so that the spindle shaft 64 assumed a rotary speed equal to or lower than that of the rotor shaft 18 at the minimum operative rotor speed. Therefore, for causing a windmill 11 to attain the operative speed out of the rest position, in which the rotor blades 61 are in the vane position, the electric motor 63 has to be driven first with a low speed and subsequently with a high speed in order to attain an operative rotor speed lying between minimum and maximum. In order to reduce the maximum operative speed to the minimum operative speed the electric motor 63 has to be driven with the low speed.If the windmill 1 after having reached the minimum operative speed has to be set in the rest position, the manipulations described hereinafter are carried out for putting the windmill out of operation in an emergency case. When due to a state of emergency the windmill 1 has to be put out of operation as soon as possible, this is performed with the blade setting mechanism 29 in accordance with the invention in the safest manner as follows The electro magnetic coupling 65 is disengaged by obviating the electric power and the electro magnetic brake 66 is caused to operate also by obviating the electric energization, whilst the electric energization of the electric motor 63 is also switched off. As result the spindle shaft rotation is slowed down with respect to the rotor shaft rotation and the rotor blades 61 are adjusted towards the vane position so that the mill rotor 26 is aerodynamically braked, whilst for this adstmggat no internal source of energy is required. In the holow rotor shaft 18 the spinle shaft 64 is coupled by means of a worm 71 with the gland 68, which is slidably journalled in the hollow rotor shaft 18 by means of guide rods 72 and is guarded against rotation with respect to the rotor shaft 18. The rotor shaft 18 is provided with an annular bumper 73, which is fastened by means of bolts 74 tithe rotor shaft 18 and on which the guide rods are arranged. By means of ball and socket joints 75 the gland 68 is coupled with the rod system 69. The rod system 69 comprises rods 76, which are connected to the one hand by means of ball and socket joints with the gland 68 and on the other hand by means of ball and socket joints 77 with consoles 78 Fig. 6 .The console 78 ts fastened to a collar 59 of the rotor blade 61, which is rotatably journalled by means of a rotary crown 60 at the free end 42 of the rotor shaft 18. The electro magnetic multiple disc clutch 65 comprises an annular electro magnet 79 accommodated in an energization housing 122 and journalled by means of bearincs 80 around a star wedge sleeve 81 Fig. 7 . The energization housing 122 is guarded against rotation with respect to the wall 22 of the rotor cabin part 8 and for this purpose the energization housing 122 has at least one recess 123 for a lug 124 fastened to the wall 22. The star wedge sleeve 81 is arranged around the rotor shaft 18 and guarded against rotation with respect to j the rotor shaft 18 by means of a key . On the star wedge sleeve 81 are arranged axially slidable lamellae 83 guarded against rotation relative to the star wedge sleeve 81 and extending in an radial direction.The lamellae 83 are surrounded by a star wedge housing 84, which is arranged on the spindle shaft 64 and guarded against rotation relative to the spindle shaft by means of a key 85. On the inner face 86 of the star wedge housing 84 are arranged axially slidable lamellae 87 guarded against rotation relative to the star wedge housing 84 and extending in spaces between the lamellae 83 and the star wedge housing 84. When the electro magnet 79 is energized, a magnetic field is induced in the coil 88 so that the lamellae 87 of the star wedge housing 84 and the lamellae 83 of the star wedge sleeve 81 shift in an axial direction up to a stationary inner face 86 of the star wedge housing 84 so that the lamellae 87 and 84 engage one another as a result of Which the spindle shaft 64 is coupled with the rotor shaft 18. The electric motor 63 and the electro magnetic brake 66 acting on the shaft 67 df the electric motor 63 are fastened to a frame 89 by means of the reduction gearing housing 99 of the reduction gearing 70. The frame 89 is releasably connected with the built on wall 22 of the cabinet 21 of the rotor cabin part 8. A control system for actuating the blade setting mechanism 20 includes feelers 90 accessing the rotary speed of the rotor shaft 18 and beingconnected by fastening means 91, 92 with the wall 22 of the cabinet 21 of the rotor cabin part 8. The control signals required for the blade setting mecha nism originate from the control system which will not be discussed herein. In dependence on the signals from the control system the blades 61 are adjusted by means of the blade setting mechanism 20 towards and, respectively, away form the vane position. when the electric power is lacking due to disturbance, the electro magnetic clutch 65 is released so that the spindle shaft 64 is disconnected from the rotor shaft 18, whilst the electro magnetic brake 66 on the electric motor shaft 67 of the electric motor 63 is actuated so that the rotation of the spindle shaft 64, which is coupled by means of the reduction gearing 70 with the electric motor shaft 67, is slowed down relatively to the rotor shaft 18 and the rotor blades 61 are adjusted towards the vane position without using the electric motor 63 and the mill rotor 26 comets to a standstill. The variant of the blade setting mechanism 20 shown in Fig. 8 is identical to the blade setting mechanism 20 ofFig. 3, the difference being that the spindle shaft 64 is coupled through a bevel gearing 93 with the rotor blades 61. The rotor cabin part 8 embodying the invention, with which the cabinet 21, the rotor bearing housing 25 and the gear wheel drive housing 27 constitute an integral unit, can be removed together with the mechanismsl8, 19, 20 surrounded by the rotor cabin part 8 as an unit from the stationary cabin part 7 of the cabin 6. In the case of a windmill park the rotor cabin part 8 to be removed for maintenance or repair purposes can be replaced by a spare rotor cabin part 8, after which the maintenance and repair operations can be carried in a revision shop. To the generator 28 applies the same as to the rotor cabin part 8.
