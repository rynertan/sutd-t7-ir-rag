# Flow monitoring method and apparatus.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for monitoring flow rate through a conduit. A flow number indicative of the flow rate of a liquid through the conduit 12 is compared with a pre selected reference number. The actual liquid flow through the conduit 12 provides a clocking signal which determines the time span during which a count signal, indicative of the intended flow rate into the conduit 12 , is accumulated thereby providing the flow number.
