# APPARATUS FOR AND METHOD OF DETECTING SCANNING TYPE DISPAPPARATUS FOR AND METHOD OF DETECTING SCANNING TYPE DISPLAY PICTURE LAY PICTURE

## Abstract
When a scanning type display picture 2 is imaged and detected by a scanning type imaging device 4, 5, 6 , the detected picture is sometimes different from the original picture. That is, a part of the original picture is missing, or a false image not existent in the original picture appears. In the whole detected picture, the missing part or the false image part moves in relation to the respective periods of the two scannings of the display image and the imaging device. When note is taken of the phenomena of such movements, it is possible to supplement the missing part and eliminate the false image on the basis of a plurality of display pictures.
