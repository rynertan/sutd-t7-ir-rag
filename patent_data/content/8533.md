# Preparation of stabilized manganese II ethylene bis dithiocarbamate and fungicidal compositions containing it.

## Abstract
Manganese II ethylenebis dithiocarbamate of low ethylenethiourea content can be prepared by mixing di sodium ethylenebis dithiocarbamate with formaldehyde in aqueous medium then mixing a water soluble manganese II salt to precipitate the maneb. The product can be further formulated with a metal salt and also with paraformaldehyde. Fungicidal compositions may be prepared by formulating with conventional carriers or adjuvants.
