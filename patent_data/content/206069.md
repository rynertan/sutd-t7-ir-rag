# Multi stage particulate material dryer having channelized discharge.

## Abstract
A gravity flow grain dryer 10 for particulate material comprises first and second generally vertical drying columns 68, 100 spaced apart to provide a plenum chamber 112 therebetween, the drying columns each having opposed spaced walls 20, 70, 108, 110 with pertorate portions. Drying air is passed through the pertorate portions in a treating zone in the columns 68, 100 . First and second inputs 32, 72, 90, 96 are provided for introducing particulate material into top portions of the first and second drying columns 68, 100 , respectively. First, second, third and fourth discharge means 84, 82, 126, 124 are also provided for removing particulate material from bottom portions of the first and second drying columns 68, 100 , respectively. Associated with the first and second discharge means 82, 84 is a dividing wall 76 which extends between a pair of the spaced walls 20, 70 below the treating zone of the column 68 for dividing a bottom portion of the column into at least two channels 78, 80 . The first discharge means 84 is associated with a first of the channels 80 and the second discharge means 82 is associated with a second of the channels 78 . The first channel 80 is adjacent the first wall 70 and the first discharge means 84 is adapted to discharge particulate material at a rate faster than the second discharge means 82 .
