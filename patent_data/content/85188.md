# Mounting insulator for internal combustion engine or the like.

## Abstract
A plate spring 26 is operatively connected to an automotive internal combustion engine 52 so that when the engine vibrates with a relatively high frequency and small amplitude, the plate spring is merely moved backwards and forwards across an essentially flat home position wherein it exhibits a zero or even negative spring constant, and so that when the engine vibrates with a relatively low frequency and large amplitude, the spring is flexed to the degree of exhibiting a high spring constant and thus transmits the vibrational energy therethrough to a resilient body 18 or unit interconnecting same with the vehicle chassis 14 .
