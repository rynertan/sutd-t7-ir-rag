# Vibration damping device.

## Abstract
A vibration damping device comprises two vibration damping fluid chambers 26, 30 , and a partition 22 inter posed between the two fluid chambers and provided with a restricted passage 24 . In this device, an auxiliary vibration damping unit 36 is arranged in one 26 of the two fluid chambers subjected to vibrations from a vibration source. The auxiliary vibration damping unit preferably comprises an elastic sheet 40 and a pair of deformation restricting members 38, 42 housing the elastic sheet therebetween.
