# Corotron device and electrophotographic machine using the device.

## Abstract
A corotron device comprises a corotron 4 and a power supply circuit 27 . The power supply circuit 27 supplies to the corotron 4 an unfiltered, full wave rectified voltage which it derives from an AC input voltage 25a, 25b . The device is used in an electrophotographic machine, the corotron being especially useful as a charging corotron 4 or as a transfer corotron 12 .
