# Apparatus for scraping sludge from the surface of a body of liquid.

## Abstract
Sludge floating on the surface of liquid protrudes upwardly through a stabilisation grid and is removed by scraping means into a gutter. In order to prevent the scraping means pushing the sludge back downwardly through the grid, the scraping means is provided with a knife which is driven in a forward movement towards the gutter and a return move ment away from the gutter. In the forward movement the knife is tilted downwardly towards its free edge so as to cut the sludge and push it into the gutter. During the return move ment, the free edge is raised above the grid.
