# Wallcoverings in roll form.

## Abstract
A wallcovering comprising a paper ply 13 and plastics ply 10 laminated together and embossed after lamination has materials of the plies chosen so that inherent expansion of the paper ply when wetted is substantially wholly restrained by high resistance of the plastics ply to stretching without taking the plastics ply beyond its elastic limit so that the wall covering does not bubble or pucker when the paper ply is wetted. Materials suitable for the plastics ply are foamed poly styrene and orientated polypropylene. A degree of fissuring, of the plastics ply during embossing is acceptable and can aid porosity for drying.
