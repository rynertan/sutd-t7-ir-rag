## Description
UNSATURATED POLYESTER RESIN COMPOSITION AND LAMINATES The present invention relates to an unsaturated polyester resin composition and laminates for electric use which are prepared from the resin composition. More particularly, the invention relates to an unsaturated polyester resin composition which is available at a low cost and with which cellulose base materials can be impregrated effectively to give lamiantes which can be satisfactorily punched at low temperatures, the laminates nevertheless hav . ing high resistance to thermal softening and outstanding electrical characteristics. The invention further relates to such laminates for electric use. The term laminates for electric use or electric laminates as used herein refers to laminates or laminates clad with metal foil which are used, for example, as base boards for various electronic parts and which are in the form of a plate having a thickness, for example, of 0.5 to 5 mm. Such laminates are prepared by pretreating a cellulosic base material with methylol compound or the like, then impregnating the base material with an unsaturated polyester resin, thereafter laminating sheets of the base material and curing the resulting assembly. For example, see Published Unexamined Japanese Patent ApplicationNo. 98136 1981. The unsaturated polyester resin is composed of an unsaturated alkyd and a crosslinking monomer. Usable as the alkyd is, for example, a compound which is well known and has the molecular structural formula ofEMI2.1 It is well known that the properties of unsaturated polyesters are variable over a wide range in accordance with the selection of materials therefor, i.e.,polyhydric alcohol, unsaturated polybasic acid, saturated polybasic acid, etc. However, electric laminates, especially those incorporating a paper base material, must have extremely contradictory properties for example, they must be resistant to thermal softening even when treated in a solder bath having as high a temperature as 260 C while possessing satisfactory punchability at low temperatures. Although we made investigations into various unsaturated polyester resins commercially available for the single use thereof or conjoint use of at least two of such resins, we were unable to obtain satisfactory laminates, because laminates which were amenable to punching at low temperatures were low in flexural modulus at high temperatures, whereas those satisfactory in the mudulus at high temperatures had reduced punchability at low temperatures. To overcome the above problem, we have conducted intensive research and found that an electric laminate satisfactory in both punchability at low temperatures and resistance to thermal softening and outstanding in electrical characteristics can be prepared by impregnating sheets of a base material with an unsaturated polyester resin composition comprising a 30 to 99 by weight of an unsaturated polyester resin comprising a crosslinking monomer and an unsaturated alkyd obtained by reacting at least dicyclopentadiene hereinafter abbreviated as DCPD , an unsaturated polycarboxylic acid and a polyhydric alcohol, and b 1 to 70 by weight of a hardness adjusting unsaturated polyester resin, laminating the sheets and curing the resulting assembly.Thus, we have accomplished the present invention, which will be described below in detail. First, unsaturated polyester resins useful in this invention will be described. Unsaturated alkyds containing DCPD are known and are prepared by reacting DCPD, an unsaturated polycarboxylic acid, a polyhydric alcohol and, when required, a saturated polycarboxylic acid. Useful unsaturated polycarboxylic acids are usually maleic anhydride, fumaric acid and like unsaturated dicarbox ylic acids and anhydrides thereof. Useful polyhydric alcohols include ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, diethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, glycerin, trimethylolpropane, pentaerythritol, etc. Useful saturated polycarboxylic acids include phthalic anhydride, isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, adipic acid, sebacic acid, azelaic acid, trimellitic acid, pyromellitic acid, etc. and anhydrides of such acids. For the preparation of DCPD containing unsaturated alkyds, it is convenient to use maleinized DCPD represented by the formulaEMI4.1 and obtained by reacting DCPD with maleic acid or maleic anhydride and water at a temperature of up to 1400 C. This compound can also be prepared by reacting hydroxylated DCPD with maleic anhydride. The unsaturated alkyd is obtained by the dehydration condensation of the maleinized DCPD, the remaining polycarboxylic acid component and polyhydric alcohol at about 150 to about 2100 C. Further when isophthalic acid, fumaric acid or like high melting polycarboxylic acid is used, the polycarboxylic acid component and the polyhydric alcohol are subjected to dehydration condensation first to obtain an oligoester, to which maleinized DCPD is added for further condensation, whereby a light colored unsaturated alkyd can be obtained with reduced formation of scales. With the progress of the reaction, maleic groups derived from the maleinized DCPD and maleic anhydride are fumarinized. The fumarinization degree fumaric groups maleic groups fumaric groups x 100 to be achieved by the reaction varies with the reaction conditions and is adjustable to a desired value generally of at least 50 . When reacting maleinized DCPD a with the polyhydric alcohol b and the remaining polycarboxylic acid component c directly or with the oligoester resulting from the latter two components, the proportion of the maleinizedDCPD in the overall acid component in terms of mole number, i.e., a c commat , is preferably 40 to 80 mole . If the proportion of the maleinized DCPD in the overall acid component is less than 40 mole , the unsaturated alkyd molecule contains an insufficient amount of DCPD and fails to fully exhibit its characteristics, giving the resulting resin composition insufficient resistance to thermal softening at high temperatures. On the other hand, if the proportion exceeds 80 mole , the resin obtained is hard and brittle, requires a large amount of hardness adjusting resin to assure satisfactory punchability at low temperatures, easily softens thermally at high temperatures and encounters difficulty in retaining satisfactory electrical characteristics. Thus, various drawbacks result. For the preparation of laminates for electric use which can be punched satisfactorily at low temperatures and are improved in resistance to thermal softening and in electrical characteristics, it is desirable that the proportion of the maleinized DCPD in the acid component be 40 to 80 mole . To modify the properties of the unsaturated polyester, it is possible to use small amounts of organic acid and alcohol for the condensation according to the invention. Examples useful for this purpose are fatty acids and alcohols having about 8 to about 22 carbon atoms, such as lauric acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, lauryl alcohol, oleyl alcohol, etc. The unsaturated alkyd obtained by reacting maleinized DCPD with a polyhydric alcohol and the remaining acid component directly or after the formation of an oligoester is sealed off chiefly with the maleinized DCPD at the terminals of each molecule, has a low molecular weight and therefore has low viscosity. When cured, the alkyd possesses a bulky DCPD skeleton, is accordingly resistant to heat, does not readily absorb moisture due to its hydrophorbic properties and appears to exhibit improved characteristics when loaded with moisture. The unsaturated polyester resin composition of the present invention comprises 30 to 99 by weight of an unsaturated polyester resin a composed of the abovementioned unsaturated alkyd and a crosslinking monomer, and 1 to 70 by weight of a hardness adjusting unsaturated polyester resin b blended with the resin a . The hardness adjusting unsaturated polyester resin b to be used in this invention is a resin which is admixed with the unsaturated polyester resin a to adjust the hardness of the resin a on curing and also to assure other characteristics in balance. Although the resin for this purpose is not particularly limited, especially suitable are soft unsaturated polyester resins, such as those containing a polyol component or acid component which functions as a soft segment. Examples of preferred soft resins which are commercially available are Polymal 6320F manufactured byTakeda Chemical Industries, Ltd., Rigor at 70F manufactured by Showa Kobunshi Co., Ltd., Ester F2240 manufactured byMitsui Toatsu Co., Ltd., etc.The amount of the hardness adjusting unsaturated polyester resin to be used, which of course varies with the properties desired for the resin composition to be obtained, is 1 to 70 by weight, preferably 10 to 60 by weight, based on the composition. In addition to the soft unsaturated polyester resin, it is also possible to use an unsaturated polyester resin having a large quantity of unsaturated bonds, bisphenol type unsaturated polyester resin or like hard unsaturated polyester resin. While the crosslinking monomer is typically styrene, also usable are a methylstyrene, vinyltoluene, chlorostyrene, divinylbenzene, C1 C10 alkyl acrylates, C1 C10 alkyl methacrylates, diallyl phthalate, triallyl cyanurate and like monomers, and mixtures of styrene and such monomers. In view of the mechanical properties and viscosity of the resin composition and the ability thereof to penetrate into the base material for impregnation, the total amount of the crosslinking monomer is preferably 20 to 50 by weight based on the composition. The resin composition of the present invention can be cured with use of organic peroxides which are generally employed. Especially when one or a plurality of peroxyketals, dialkyl peroxides and peroxyesters are used, favorable results are achieved in respect of the resistance of laminates to soldering heat, and the electrical insulation characteristics and adhesion thereof. Examples of preferred organic peroxides are peroxyketals such as l,l bis t butylperoxy 3,3,5 trimethylcyclohexane and l,l bis t butylperoxy cyclohexane, dialkyl peroxides such as di t butyl peroxide, peroxyesters such as t butylperoxy benzoate, etc. Such peroxides are used in an amount of about 0.5 to about 2.0 parts by weight based on the resin composition. Useful curing catalysts are not limited to those given above also usable singly or conjointly with organic peroxides are photosensitive curing catalysts, curing catalysts which are sensitive to electron rays or like radiation, and other known curing catalysts. Of course, the composition may have further incorporated therein a flame retardant, flame retardant auxiliary agent, polymerization inhibitor, ultraviolet absorber, filler, coloring agent, etc. in accordance with the contemplated purpose. The unsaturated polyester resin composition of the present invention is favorably usable for producing electric laminates by a known method. Stated more specifically, such a laminate can be produced by impregnating a base material with the resin composition, laminating sheets of the impregnated base material and curing the resulting asssembly, with a metal foil superposed on one or both sides of the assembly in the case of metal clad laminate. Examples of useful base materials are glass cloth, glass mat and like materials and, preferably, cellulosic materials or those made of a blend of such materials. Kraft paper and linter paper are especially preferable to use.When kraft paper or linter paper is used, it is desirable to pre impregnate the paper with an N methylol compound, such as melamine, before the impregnation with the present resin composition to give the base material enhanced affinity for the resin composition. When curing the assembly of laminated resin impregnated base sheets, it is most preferable to continuously cure the assembly substantially without applying any shaping pressure thereto. Base materials can be impregnated with the resin composition of the invention effectively and rapidly to give laminates. The laminates obtained can be punched satisfactorily at low temperatures and are outstanding in resistance to thermal softening and in electrical characteristics. The present invention will be described in detail with reference to the following examples, in which the parts and percentages are by weight.Preparation Example 1 A 792 g quantity of DCPD, 588 g of maleic anhydride and 113 g of water were placed into a 3 liter flask equipped with a stirrer, thermometer, reflux tube and nitrogen supply tube and were heated at 130 to 140 C with stirring for 2.5 hours in a nitrogen stream to quantitatively obtain maleinizedDCPD A having an acid value of 224.
