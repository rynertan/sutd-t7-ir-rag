Then, the catalyst was filtered off and the filtrate was concentrated. The residue was recrystallized from methanol ethyl ether to give 409 mg of 1 4 aminophenyl 3 methyl 2 pyrazolin 5 one dihydrochloride Compound No. 50 as pale brown crystals. In the same manner as Synthetic example 1, the Compound No. 51 shown in Table 1 was synthesized. By use of Wister strain male rat, brain homogenate was prepared following the procedure as described below. Chest was opened under anesthesia by intraperitoneal administration of 45 mg kg of pentobarbital sodium, and a polyethylene tube was intubated into aorta from left ventricle to be fixed therein. Next, a brain perfusion was conducted through the tube with ice cooled 50 mM phosphate buffered physiological saline pH 7.4 hereinafter referred to as PBS , and the whole brain was extirpated. After removal of cerebellum, the wet weight of cerebrum was measured and, with addition of 9 fold amount of PBS, it was broken by a Teflon homogenizer in ice water to be homogenized. After the brain homogenate was subjected to centrifugation at 4 C at 2200 rpm for 10 minutes, 0.3 ml of the supernatant was apportioned into a light shielding test tube equipped with a ground stopper, to provide a brain homogenate for evaluation of medicine. To the brain homogenate prepared in a , 0.6 ml of PBS and 10 µl of ethanolic solution of a test medicine were added to a final concetration of 500 µM or a concentration at a common ratio of 3 between 0.3 and 100 µm , and the mixture was heated in a warm bath at 37 C for 30 minutes. Subsequently, after addition of 200 µl of an aqueous 35 perchloric acid solution, centrifugation was effected at 4 C at 2600 rpm for 10 minutes to obtain a supernatant. Also, the same operation was performed by addition of 10 µl of ethanol blank in place of 10 µl ethanolic solution of the test medicine for measurement of blank. To 0.1 ml of the supernatant obtained in b , 0.2 ml of aqueous 8.1 sodium dodecyl sulfate solution, 1.5 ml of 20 acetate buffer pH 3.5 , 1.5 ml of aqueous 0.67 2 thiobarbituric acid solution and 0.7 ml of distilled water, followed by mixing. Next, this mixture was heated in a boiling water bath for 60 minutes and then quenched with ice water, and 1.0 ml of distilled water and 5.0 ml of a pyridine butanol mixture 1 15 were added. After shaking for about 30 seconds, the mixture was subjected to centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes, and the supernatant was provided as a sample for measurement of peroxidized lipid. A standard solution was prepared by adding 0.1 ml of Lipoperoxide test containing 5 nmol ml 1,1,3,3 tetraethoxypropane, produced by Wako Junyaku K.K. in place of the brain homogenate obtained in b . The peroxidized lipid was measured by use of a fluorescent spectrophotometer model 204, produced by Hitachi Seisakusho K.K. at an excitation wavelength of 515 nm and a fluorescence wavelength of 550 nm, and the peroxidized lipid quantity TBA value was determined according to the following formula A Wistar strain male rat weighing about 400 g was intra musculary administered with 0.6 mg of d tubocurarine to be immobilized and, while maintaining the rectal temperature at 37 to 38 C under artificial respiration, the electroencephalogram of the left cerebral frontal cortex was measured and recorded. Also, within the left femoral artery and vein, cannulas for measurement of artery pressure and for administration of medicine were placed, respectively. As the active ingredient of the present invention, sodium salt of the compound represented by Formula I was used and the respective doses of said active ingredient and 30 mg kg of phenobarbital sodium salt produced by Iwaki Seiyaku K.K. hereinafter called PHB or 5mg kg of pentobarbital sodium salt hereinafter called PBT were each dissolved in physiological saline and administered intravenously in a liquid amount of 1 ml kg. The action of the active ingredient of the present invention affecting the cortex electroencephalogram after PHB or PBT administration was investigated as follows Namely, at the time of 5 minutes or later after PHB or PBT administration when increase of the slow wave component can be clearly recognized on electroencephalogram, 1, 3, 10, 30 and 100 mg kg of the active ingredient were administered. To the control group 1 ml kg of physiological saline was intravenously administered. Recording and analysis of electroencephalogram were continuously drawn together with artery pressure, heart rate and rectal temperature on the recorder through a multi purpose monitoring recording device model RM 85, produced by Nippon Koden K.K. . At the same time, electroencephalogram was recorded in data recorder model A 65, produced by Sony K.K. , and compressed spectral array analysis was conducted by means of a computer for medical data processing ATAC 450, produced by Nippon Koden K.K. . By administration of 30 mg kg of PHB, the cerebral cortical electroencephalogram becomes high voltage slow wave, thus exhibiting clearly sleep like electroencephalogram. Such an action persists for at least 3 hours or longer after the administration. In contrast, when the active ingredient of the present invention was administered even in an amount of 100 mg kg, not only the drowsy pattern of electroencephalogram as observed in the case of PHB, but also no appearance of low voltage fast wave component arousal pattern was recognized at all. From this fact, it has been found that the active ingredient of the present invention has no effect on normal electroencephalogram at all even when administered in a large amount. However, when the active ingredient of the present invention was administered during appearance of the drowsy pattern of electroencephalogram after PHB or PBT administration, the drowsy pattern of electroencephalogram was normalized depending on the dose thereof. The results are shown in Table 2. A Wistar strain male rat weighing about 400 g was administered intramuscularly with 0.6 mg of d tubocurarine to be immobilized and, after a trachea cannulation, the head portion was fixed under artificial respiration on a stereotaxic device. The head skin was cut open, cranial bone was bored, and then bipolar electrode for lead out of electroencephalogram were placed on the surface of the subdural left frontal cerebral cortex. After the electrode was fixed with the cranial bone by use of dental cement, the animal was held on its back. Next, a cannula for measurement of systemic pressure was placed within the left femoral artery, and a cannula for additional administration of d tubocurarine within the left femoral vein, respectively. The heart rate was measured and recorded by driving a heart rate meter with the artery wave. After blood pressure, heart rate and various parameters of electroencephalogram were stabilized, 10 mg kg of the active ingredient of the present invention prepared in a suspension so as to give 1 ml kg in 1 tragacanth gum solution was administered directly into duodenum 30 minutes before cerebral ischemia loading. To the control group, only the 1 tragacanth gum solution of the same volume was administered similarly. Ten to twenty minutes after administration of the medicine, while monitoring the electroencephalogram, blood pressure and heart rate on a multi purpose monitoring recording device RM 85 model, produced by Nippon Koden K.K. , the following operations were performed according to the methods shown below for cerebral ischemia loading. First, ribs were set free at the left costicartilage end to open the chest. Next, cerebral blood flow was blocked for ten minutes by obstructing the left common carotid artery and the left subclavian artery exposed at the aorta originating portion at the same time, and then the brachiocephalic trunk by use of artery clips 30 minutes after administration of the medicine. Recirculation of cerebral blood flow was effected by releasing at the same time the two artery clips mounted on the respective sites as mentioned above. The protective action of the medicine for the disorder after recirculation of cerebral ischemia was examined by the presence of restoration of electroencephalogram, and survival time of animal after the recirculation. During the experiment, the rectal temperature of the animal was maintained at 37 to 38 C by use of a warming mat. Also, the rectal temperature was continuously drawn on the recorder together with electroencephalogram, femoral artery pressure and heart rate. When cerebral ischemia was loaded for 10 minutes, the voltage of electroencephalogram was lowered immediately after ischemia until electroencephalogram became disappeared and leveled after elapse of about 15 seconds. Such flattening of electroencephalogram during loading of ischemia was recognized commonly in both of the control group and the group administered with the active ingredient of the present invention. Even when cerebral ischemia for ten minutes was released and recirculated, no appearance of electroencephalogram was recognized at all in all the cases of the control group and flattering of electroencephalogram was continued to be maintained similarly as during loading of ischemia. By persistence of such a flattened electroencephalogram, the animals were dead 75 minutes after recirculation on an average. However, in the group administered with the active ingredient of the present invention, electroencephalogram appeared by restoration during recirculation period, whereby the function of the cardiovascular system were activated and normalized simultaneously with restoration of the so called cerebral functions. As the overall results of these, the survival time of animals after recirculation was clearly elongated. The results are shown in Table 3. Further, particularly for the case of employing the compound represented by the formula I A Compound No. 1 as the active ingredient, its dose was varied for evaluation of its protective action after recirculation of cerebral ischemia. As the result, in the group administered with the active ingredient of the present invention electroencephalogram appeared by restoration during recirculation period depending on the dose of 3 to 10 mg kg, whereby the functions of the cardiovascular system were activated and normalized simultaneously with restoration of the so called cerebral functions. As the overall result of these, the survival time of animals after the recirculation was clearly elongated. The results are shown in Table 4. The following components were mixed in a conventional manner and tabletted by means of a conventional device. The following components were mixed in a conventional manner and filled in soft capsules. The following components were mixed in a conventional manner and 1 ml ampoules were prepared.
