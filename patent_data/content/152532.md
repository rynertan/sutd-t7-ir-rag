# Method for installing blind fasteners.

## Abstract
A method for installing blind fastener 10 for securing workpieces 12, 16 is provided having as principle com ponents a stem member 24 , a drive nut 28 , and a deform able annular means 26 . The stem member 24 has an externally threaded portion 32 on the accessible side thereof, and may have a stemhead 36 on the nonacces sible side thereof. The drive nut 28 to be screwed onto the externally threaded portion 32 of the stem member 24 . The deformable annular means 26 has as principle parts a head which is larger in diameter than the diameter of the boreholes 20, 22 of the workpieces 12, 16 , and an inter mediate part adjacent the head which may have an outside diameter with slightly smaller or slightly larger than the diameter of the boreholes 20, 22 , and a deformable tail part 70 C adjacent the intermediate part and abutting the stemhead 36 for securing the workpieces 12, 16 when the fastener is set. The outer portion of the stem member 24 contains a turning means 34 for rotating the stem member 24 relative to the drive nut 28 . Either the stem member 24 or the drivenut 28 are held fast while rotating the other until the fastener 10 is set and upon further rotation of the stem member 24 relative to the drive nut 28 will cause the stem member 24 to break at the intersection between the drive nut 28 and head. The break is located at a point on the stem member 24 which, when the fastener 10 is set, is substantially flush with the top outer surface 14 of the head. The fasteners 10 of this invention are particularly useful for the aircraft industry.
