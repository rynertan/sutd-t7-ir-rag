# TELEPHONE

## Abstract
In a telephone comprising a transmitter 1 for converting an input sound into an input electrical signal, a transforming means 3 for transforming the input signal, and a line driver 5 for transmitting a signal transformed by the transforming means 3 to a telephone line 6a, 6b , the telephone further comprises a detector 2 for detecting a voltage level of the input signal, and a comparator 4 for comparing the voltage level of the input signal with a predetermined reference voltage level to output a result of the comparison, and the transforming means 3 transforms the input signal at a first transformation factor when the result of the comparison represents that the input signal level is lower than the predetermined reference voltage level, and at a second transfor mation factor which is larger than the first transformation factor when the result of the comparison represents that the input signal level is not lower than the predetermined reference voltage level. The telephone can transmit only the signal according to speaker s speech and have a high speech quality.
