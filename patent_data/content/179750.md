# MODULAR DISTRIBUTION FRAME

## Abstract
A distribution frame for use in telecommunications to interconnect equipment and distribution lines is disclosed. The distribution frame is selectively configurable to provide a varible number of terminations or protection circuits and includes a frame having on the front side thereof a plurality of mounting positions each for receiving and demountable supporting a termination module. Each termination module includes a termination panel having symmetrical first and second generally planar portions spaced apart at a rear end of the module and extending forward and toward one another to a front end. The panels have mounted thereon a plurality of double ended insulation displacement connec tors with the opposite ends extending on opposite faces of the panel. A rear module panel includes a plurality of fifty pin connectors wired to the double ended connectors. The frame may be configured to demountably support a plurality of overvoltage protection panels on the rear side thereof, with the ports to the overvoltage protection circuits provided by fifty pin connectors such that incoming or outgoing lines may be routed through the protection circuits and the protection circuits may be coupled to the termination modules via cables.
