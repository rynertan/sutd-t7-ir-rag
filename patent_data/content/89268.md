Any water insoluble liquid pesticide or a solution ther water insoluble solvent can be used in place of the recited liquid carbamate. Also, any water insoluble, solid pesticide that is subsly insoluble less than 5 in the liquid pesticide can be used in the recited s triazine. The ratio of the liquid thiolcarbarnate to the solid s tr can range frcm 1 1 to 12 1 with the total amount of active ingredie varying between 50 to 85 percent by total weight at the 1 1 ratio t tween 71.5 to 80.5 percent by total weight at the 12 1 ratio. The use of a recited antidote compound is optional. The the amount of antidote that in the composition will be zero when nor desired. When it is desired, the amount can range up to an amount that is herbicidal. This range is termed an antidotally effective amount. Generally, this range will vary from 0.1 to about 15.0 percent by weight based upon the weiaht of the thiolcarbamate. Preferably the range is between about 3 to about 5 percent by weight based upon the weight of the thiolcar bamate. The combined weight of the water insoluble anionic and non ionic or modified non ionic emulsifiers can range between 5.0 to 20.0 percent by weight based upon the total weight of the formulation. Preferably, the amount of the anionic emulsifier can vary from about 15 to about 65 percent by weight of the combined amount.

The pesticidal composition of the invention can be prepared by separately preparinq an oil portion and an aqueous portion and then ccmbin ing the two together along with the thickener. First considering the aqueous portion, the solid s triazine herbicide is ground to a particle size of from about 2 to about 5 microns.Preferably grinding is done in water in conventional grinding equipnent, i.e., such as a ball mill. The water soluble wetting and dispersing aqents can be canbined with the s triazine either before, during, or after the grinding step. The anti foaming agent is used during the grinding step to minimize foaming. ten water is used in the grindinq of the s triazine, an aqueous slurry of the s triazine in water results from the grinding step. The oil portion is prepared by dissolving the anionic, non ionic or modified non ionic emulsifier along with any antidote in the liquid thiolcarbamate and any diluent. The solution can be prepared in any convenient vessel. Any stirring apparatus, such as a paddle stirrer, can be used to aid solution. Heating can also be used to aid the solution. Next, the aqueous portion and the oil portion are canbined. Simply, the aqueous portion can be poured into the oil portion using conventional equipment. Simple stirring can be used to form a homogeneous mixture. Next, the thickener is added to the combined portions to increase the viscosity of the mixture and insure suspension of the s triazine.

The bottle is capped, warmed and shaken to yield a clear, banogenous solution. The aqueous portion of the formulation is prepared by weighing the wetting aqent, dispersing agent, anti foaming agent, water and atrazine previously air milled to an average particle size of 3 4 microns into a two liter glass beaker. The beaker is fitted with a flexible plastic cover. A high speed dissolver, extending through an opening in the cover down to the bottom of the beaker, is used to blend the ingredients into an aqueous slurry. The liquid portion 455.0 grams was weighed into a 4 liter glass beaker. Next, 535.0 g of the resulting aqueous slurry of atrazine is added to the liquid portion of the formulation and 10.0 trams of fumed silicas are added as a suspending agent. The mixture is covered and swirled to wet the components. Finally, a hiqh speed liquid dissolver is used for about 10 minutes to completely blend all the ingredients. The resulting product is a homogenous liquid mixture and remains stable to separation. The product can be diluted with hard and soft water or nitrogenous fertilizer solutions.

The bottle is capped, warmed and shaken to yield a clear, homogenous solution. The aqueous portion of the formulation is prepared by weighing the wetting aqent, dispersinq agent, anti foaminq agent, water and atrazine into a half gallon ceramic ball mill containing one half inch ceramic balls. The mill is covered and turned on rollers for three days. The average size of the atrazine in the slurry is reduced to about 3 4 microns measured on a Coulter counter . The milled slurry 900 g is poured into a glass tray 12.5 x 8.5 x 2.0 inches and allowed to air dry. The partially dried material is placed in an oven at 90 100 F overnight to cwpletely remove the remaining water. A solid material 517.5 g is obtained. Next, 372 grams of the dried material was combined with 420 g of the liquid portion and 8.0 q of fumed silicas in a half gallcn ceramic ball mill. The mill was turned for about 3 hours to yield a homogeneous suspension of the solid atrazine in the liquid thiolcarbamate. The resulting product liquid mixture remains stable to separation. The product can be diluted with hard and soft water or nitrogenous fertilizer solutions. The ccoaosition of this invention can be applied by standard tank mix operations using water to dilute the concentrate, or it can be applied by addition to irrigation water supplied to the field. These methods of application permit the penetration of the active cOmpOsition into the soil as the water is absorbed therein. It is not necessary that the coooosi tions be admixed with the soil particles. After application by the above discussed methods, the wetted top soil can be tilled below the surface to a depth of at least one half inch by conventional means such as discing, dragging, or mixing. An herbicide is a casound which controls or modifies plant growth, e.q., killing, retarding, defoliating, desiccating, requlating, stunting, tillering, stimulating, and dwarfing. Plant refers to all physical parts, including seeds, seedlings, saplings, roots, tubers, stems, stalks, foliage, and fruits. Plant growth is meant to include all phases of developnent fran seed germination to natural or induced cessation of life. A manufacturer of a particular herbicide recommends a range of rates and concentrations calculated to maximize weed control. The range of rates varies fran approxiately 0.01 to 50 pounds per acre lb A 0.0112 to 56 kilograms per hectare k ha , usually from 0.1 to 25 lb A 0.112 to 28 k ha . The actual amount used depends upon several considerations including particular weed susceptibility and overall cost limit tions. Unfortunately, at these rates of application both weeds and the intended crop beneficiary can be injured. Therefore, a particular herbicide s use may be limited by its injurious effect On the cultivated crop. To preserve the beneficial aspects of herbicide use and to mitigate crop damage, herbicidal antidotes have been developed. These antidotes reduce or eliminate damage to the crop without substantially impairing the ameliorative effect of the herbicide. They are described inU.S. Patent Nos. 3,989,502, 4,021,224, 4,072,688 and 4,124,372, which are incorporated herein by reference. Although several explanatory theories have been advanced, the precise mechanism by which an antidote reduces herbicidal injury has not been empirically verified. An antidote cwound may in fact by a remedy, interferent, protectant, or antagonist. As used herein antidote describes the effect of herbicidal phytoxocity to weed species and reduced or non phytotoxicity to cultivated crop species.
