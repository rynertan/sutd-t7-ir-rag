METHOD FOR PREPARING OPTICALLY ACTIVE DIALKYL TRANS EPOXYSUCCINATESBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the invention This invention relates to a method for preparing optically active dialkyl trans epoxysuccinates.2. Description of the Prior Art In the past, there have been known the following methods for optically active dialkyl trans epoxysuccinates 1 a method which comprises esterifying D transepoxysuccinic acid which is obtained by fermentation or its barium salt, with a lower alcohol in the presence of sulfuric acid Max W. Miller Journal of MedicinalChemistry, 6, 233 1963 1, and 2 a method for preparing a diethyl D orL trans epoxysuccinate which comprises resolvingDL trans epoxysuccinic acid which is obtained by epoxidation of fumaric acid, with or l naphthyl ethylamine and the like, and then esterifying the resulting D or L trans epoxysuccinic acid with ethanol in the presence of sulfuric acid Nohira et al, the previous substances II of the lectures at the 48th National Meeting of the ChemicalSociety of Japan, page 831 . However, in the method through fermentation indicated in the above item 1 , there can be obtained dialkyl D trans epoxysuccinate only. On the other hand, in the method through resolution indicated in the above item 2 , there are drawbacks such as necessity of the complicated step for preparing diethyl D or Ltrans epoxysuccinate after resolution.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION As a result of earnest studies to overcome the prior drawbacks, the present inventors have succeeded in preparing an optically active dialkyl transepoxysuccinate easily in better yield by esterifying directly a diastereoisomer salt which is obtained by reacting DL trans epoxysuccinic acid with an optically active arginine, with a lower alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst, without the necessity for isolating the optically active trans epoxysuccinic acid.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a method for preparing an optically active dialkyl transepoxysuccinate hereinafter referred to as Compound II which comprises esterifying a diastereoisomer salt hereinafter referred to as compound I which is obtained by reacting DL trans epoxysuccinic acid with an optically active arginine, with a lower alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst. The acid catalyst, herein, means sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, p toluenesulfonic acid and the like, and is used in amounts of 1.1 to 3.0 moles per mole of Compound I. The esterification is carried out at a temperature ranging from 20 to 1000C, preferably 40 to 1000C, for 1 to 24 hours, preferably 4 to 7 hours. The lower alcohol means an aliphatic alcohol preferably having 1 to 3 carbon atoms, and includes concretely methyl, ethyl, n propyl and i propyl alcohols, among which methyl and ethyl alcohols are preferred. The compound I of the starting material may be prepared, for example, as follows DL trans epoxysuccinic acid is dissolved in methanol while warming to 40 to 600C. To the resulting solution is added an aqueous solution of D arginine or L arginine with stirring, the mixture is allowed to stand at room temperature overnight, and the resulting crystals is collected by filtration to give D trans epoxysuccinic acid.D arginine salt or L trans epoxysuccinic acid L arginine salt. On the other hand, the filtrate is treated by a conventional manner to give L transepoxysuccinic acid D arginine salt or D tans epoxysuccinic acid L arginine salt. The objective compound of the compound II is prepared as follows The compound I is suspended in a lower alcohol which has a desired ester moiety of the compound II, the suspension is heated in the presence of an acid catalyst for esterification to give the compound II, which is then purified according to a conventional manner. The compound II thus obtained is useful not only as an intermediate of ethyl 2S, 3S 3 S 3methyl l 3 methyl butyrylcarbamoyl butylcarbamoyl oxirane 2 carboxylate and the compounds related thereto but also as an synthetic material of various natural products having physiological activity. The method of the present invention makes it possible to obtain an optically active dialkyl transepoxysuccinate easily in better yield by reacting a diastereoisomer salt which is formed by reactingDL trans epoxysuccinic acid with D or L arginine, with a lower alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst, without the step of isolating the optically active trans epoxysuccinic acid, and therefore, the method is very useful as a industrial method of intermediates of medicines.
