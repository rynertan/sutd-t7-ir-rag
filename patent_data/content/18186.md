## Description
Improved Inverter Circuit. This invention relates to improved inverter circuits In one known arranSczent of this kind, which is arranged to be driven by a continuous trein of input pulses, recurrent at a constant repetition rate, a transistor has its collector emitter path connected across a direct current source in series with the primary winding of a transformer which has a secondary winding from which an alternating current output is taken and a tertiary winding connected between base and emitter of the transistor. The drive pulses are applied between base and emitter of the transistor, in such a polarity that each pulse turns on the transistor. In a kno.n modification of the arrangement described above the necessity for drive pulses is overcome by arranging that the transistor is turned on when the core resets.This may be done by connecting an appropriate network, such as a parallel combination of resistance and capacitance, between the tertiary winding of the transformer and the transistor base, ad by returnIng the base to the pole of the direct current source which is connected to one terminal of the transformer p,imar winding4 These known arrangements hae the ctaracter istic tiat they require few components and that auto matic stabilization of th3 a. c. output against changes in input voltage is obtained to a certain extent. The present invention seeks to provide improved inverters of this general kind having more precise stabilization and in which stabilization against other parameters such as output voltage and or current changes may also be obtained. The invention provides an improved inverter comprising an oscillator including a semiconductor switch a transistor, such as a coupling transformer arranged to provide oscillation maintaining feedback from collector circuit to base circuit of the transistor and in which a circuit is provided whereby the overswing voltage applied to the collector of the transistor is limited so as to control the non conductive period of the transistor within each operating cycle. This is preferably achieved by extending the reset or off period of each operating cycle as a result of the overswing voltage limiting. The invention will be better understood from the following description of prior art and of embodiments of the invention, given with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a circuit diagram of a known pulsedriven inverter Figure 2 is an illustration of voltage wavefcrms appearing during the operation of the circuit arrangement of Figure 1 Figure 3 is a circuit diagram of a known selfoscillating inverter Figure 4 is a waveform diagram illustrating the operation of the arrangement described with reference to Figure 3 Figures 5a and 5b are waveform diagrams illustrating the this of the present invention Figure 6 is a circuit diagram of one embodiment of inverts, in accordance with the invention Figure 7 is a circuit diagram of a further embodiment of inverter in accordance with the invention Figure 8 is a circuit diagram of another embodiment of inverter in accordance with the invention Figure 9 is a circuit diagram illustrating an advantageous modification of the inverter described with reference to Figure 7 and Figure 10 is a circuit diagram i lustrating a still further embodiment of the invention. In the circuit arrangement shown in Figure 1 a d. c. source Vs is connect to terminals 1 and 2 . The primary winding 11 of a transformer 10 is connected across terminal 1 and 2, in series with the emitter collector path of a transistor 20, of which the collector 21 is connected to one terminal of transformer winding 11, the emitter 22 is connected to negative terminal 2 and the base 23 is connected to a drive input terminal 3. Transformer 10 has a secondary winding 12 from which a d. c. supply is obtained by means of a rectifying and integrating circuit 30 comprising diodes 31, 32 each of which has its anode connected t one terminal of secondary winding 12 and which have their cathodes common. The pulsating d. c. output is integrated by means of a choke or inductor 33 connected between the commoned cathodes of diodes 31, 32 and the positive output terminal 4 and a capacitor 34 connected between the output terminals 4, 5, of which the latter is connected directly to one terminal of transformer winding 12, Transformer 10 also has a tertiary or feedback winding 13. of which one terminal is connected to transistor base 23 and the other is connected to the negative supply terminal 2 and thus also to transistor emitter 22. The operation of this knawn arrangement will now be described with reference also to Figure 2, in which the upper graph A illustrates the variation with time of a voltage Vd representing the drive pulses applied between terminals 2 and 3 and the lower graph B illustrates the variation of collector emitter voltageVce during operaticn. Initially, transistor 20 is turned off and the collector 21 of the transistor is therefore at the supply potential V . Th drive pulses A are applied S between base and emitter of transistor 20 in such a polarity base positive going that the transistor is turned on and the collector emitter voltage falls abruptly to by t volt a developed in winding 13 zero. is con ition is maintained while the current in transformer primary winding 11 increases linearly, until core saturation occurs, whereupon the voltage developed in tertiary winding 13 collapses and transistor 20 turns off. The voltage between collector and emitter then rises to the level of the supply voltage and immediately thereafter performs a semi sinusoidal oscillation. After the collector emitter voltage has thus returned to the level of the supply voltage conditions remain constant until the next drive pulse is received. Figure 3 shows a known modification of the circuit arrangement of Figure 1 in which it is arranged that the transistor is turned on when the transformer resets, that is. when the core has returned to itsThis circuit is sometimes known as a blocking oscillator forward inverter. initial condition. The only alt ferences from tne circuit arrangement of Figure 1 are that instead of one terminal of tertiary winding 13 being connected directly to the base 23 of transistor oO, it is connected thereto by way of a parallel combination of a resistor 35 and n capacitor 36 and that instead of being taken to drive input terninal 3, base 23 is returned to positive supply terminal 1 by way of a resistor 37. Figure 4 shows the change produced in the variation of collector emitter voltage Vce during the operating cycle. The operation is necessarily such that the shaded areas Y and Z between the voltage curve and the horizontal line representing the level Vs of the supply voltage are equal. The invention provides an improvent upon the rior art described above and will initially be described with reference to Figures 5a and 5b. The object of the invention is to obtain à stabilized output by controlling the overswing, that is the excursion above the supply voltage Vs, of the collector emitter voltage, that is, by controlling this overswing to an automatically adjusted mean level. Since, as has been stated in the description of the circuit shown in Figure 2, the areas between the voltage curve and the supply voltage level must be equal, it will be understood that changing the level at which the overswing is ccntrolled will produce a change in the time during which the overswing persists. Thus Figure 5a shows a condition in which the collector emitter voltage Vce is controlled at a mean value Vs 2 Ve, which yields an overswing of duration tl, while Figure 5b shows a condition in which the overswing is controlled to a mean value Vs Ve, yielding an overswing of duration t2 2t An inverter operating in this manner yields pulses of constant duration at a repetition rate that varies inversely with the duration of overswing, so that if the overswing limiting level is suitably controlled, variations in output may be automatically removed. Figure 6 shows one embodiment of a circuit arrangement in accordance with th invention. blocking oscillator circuit identical with that of Figure 3 is employed, and this portion of the circuit, and the rectifier arrangement which is identical with that ofFigures 1 and 3, will not be further described. The arrangement of Figure 6, however, further includes a comparator circuit 40 of known kind in which the output d. c. voltage appearing between terminals 4 and 5 is compared arith a reference voltage and the resultant error signal is applied between the emitter 52 and base 53 of an additional transistor 50 of which the emitter 52 is connected by way of a diode 55 to one terminal of transformer secondary winding 12 and the collector 51 is connected directly to the other terminal of the secondary winding. The emitter collector path of transistor 50 .s shunted by a capacitor 56, which is charged by way of diode 55 and is discharged through transistor 50. The rate of discharge is controlled by the voltage applied by comparator 40 between the base and emitter of the transistor, so that the drop in voltage on capacitor 56 during the pulses from the blocking oscillator is controlled in accordance with the variation in the inverter output voltage, in such a manner that a drop in output voltage reduces the rate of discharge of the capacitor and thus increases the voltage at which the overswing excursion is limited. This in turn increases the repetition rate of the oscillator pulses and thus tends to increase the output voltage, yielding the desired stabilization action. The opposite effect occurs should the output voltage rise, i.e. the voltage limit for the overswing voltage is reduced, thereby decreasing the repetition rate and tending to reduce the output voltage. The general requirement is that a voltage sink effect be provided for the signal derived from the diode 55 so as t limit te peak overswing collector voltage of thc tralsistor 20. In the circuit shown in Figure 6, this voltage sink effect is achieved by the connection of the capacitor 56 between the collector and emitter terminals of the transistor 50, thereby converting the possibly current sink characteristics of the transistor into the required voltage sink. If transistor 50 is driven in a common collector mode,it becomes an inherently constant voltage sink and capacitor 56 is then not necessary. Figure 7 shows a circuit arrangement similar to that of figure 6, save that in this case transformer secondary winding 12 is tapped, the rectified output being derived from one section 12a of the winding by means of rectifying and smoothing circuit 30, as before, while the other section 12b of the secondary winding is connected by way of a diode 60, inverted as compared with diode 55, to a parallel combination of a capacitor 61 and a transistor 70, which in this case is a pnp transistor, instead of the npn transistor 50 used inFigure 6. Transistor 70 is controlled by a comparator 41 which differs from comparator 40 in yielding an error signal of opposite polarity. The operation of this arrangement is substantially identical with that of the circuit arrangement of Figure 6 and will ncb be further described. It is an advantage of the arrangements described with reference to Figures 6 and 7 that the control circuitry is isolated by the transformer 10 from the blocking oscillator circuit and its supply. However the circuits described above in relation to Figures 6 and 7 are arranged so that conduction in the transistor is terminated by saturation of tlie transformer or by the base current decreasing to a level at which the transistor can no longer pass the current required by the transformer. A further improve ment can be obtained by the addition of a resetting transistor to determine the end of the operating cycle.Such an arrangement is shown in Figure 8, where components having the same dispcsition and functions as those of Figure 6 or 7 are given tie same reference numerals and will not be further described. In this case, however, the base 23 of transistor 20 is connected to the emitter 22 of that transistor by way of the collector emiiter path of a resetting transistor 80, of which the base is returned by way of a resistor 85 to that terminal of tertiary winding 13 of transformer 10 which is connected by way of parallel resistance cap acitance combination 35, 36 to the base of transistor 20.The base 83 of transistor 80 is connected to the emitter 82 of that transistor by way of a capacitor 86. The values of resistor 85 and capacitor 86 are selected so that prior to saturation of transformer 10, transistor 80 is turned on to provide a definite and abrupt end to the working cycle. As a result, the duration of each pulse can be determined more accurately and is not dependent on the individual saturation characteristics of the particular transformer. Figure 9 shows a variation of the circuit arrangement of Figure 8, in that a diode 90 is connected in parallel with resistor 85, the polarity of this diode being such that it becomes conductive when the transistor base 83 becomes positive with respect to the potential at the other end of resistor 85. This arrangement has the effect of resetting the base voltage of transistor 80 to a negative potential varying in accordance with the voltage on capacitor 56.This voltage, which represents the control signal for the inverter, now modulates the OFF time of the blocking oscillator, as previously described, and also controls the ON time, since this latter period will be terminated when the base voltage of transistor 80 reaches a potential of approximately 0.6 V with respect to the emitter, starting from the negative voltage initially applied te it during the reset period. A decrease in the voltage across capacitor 56 will thus result in a decrease in the ON time and an increase in the OFF time, so that the blocking oscillator will now operate at a substantially constant repetition rate, but with a mark space ratio or duty cycle varying in accordance with the load on the inverter so as to produce a stabilized output voltage. A further circuit is shown in Figure 10, this circuit being similar in general configuration to that of Figure 7 on the output side and to that of Figure 9 regarding the control of the resetting transistor 80.Components having the same dis osition and functions as those previously referred to are given the same reference numerals and will not be further described. In this case, however, the collector of transistor 80 is connected to one end of the tertiary winding 13 of transformer 10 via a series combination of a resistor 71 and capacitor 72.The capacitor 72 is shunted by a series combination of two similarly poled diodes 73a, 73b, and by a single oppositely poled diode 74. Furthermore, instead of being connected to the positive terminal 1 via the resistor 37, the collector of transistor 80 is so connected via a zener diode 57 in series with a resistor 58, the junction therebetween being decoupled by a capacitor 59 and being connected to the collector of transistor 20 via a series combination of a forward biased diode 62 and a resistor 63. An inductor 64 is connected between the base of transistor 20 and the collector of transistor 80, the latter also having a series combination of a reverse biased diode 65 and a resistor 66 connected thereto and to the negative terminal 2, a resistor 67 shunting this series combination. The transistor 20 includes an emitter resistor 24 and a snubbing circuit 25 is connected between its collector and the positive terminal 1, the snubbing circuit 25 including a capacitor 26 in series with a diocs 27, a resistor 28 shunting the diode 27. The transformer 10 is shown as including a further winding 14 connected via a reverse biased diode 15 between positive and negative terminals 1, 2, this winding 14 providing a protective effect which allows the use of smaller value components in the snubber circuit 25. On the output side of the transformer 10, windings 12a, 12b are connected so as to provide a common rail connected to output terminal 5 as shown in Figure 7.Diodes 31, 32 are connected to winding 12a as previously described to provide a rectified source of current at their cathodes. The other end of winding 12b is connected via two like poled diodes 60a, 60b in series to the emitter of transistor 70, the collector of which is connected to the common rail. The base of transistor 70 is connected to control circuit 41s. The control circuit 41 receives a current representative signal from a series paralel resistor combination 42, 43, 44 connected in the output line to terminal 4, and a voltage representative signal from a potential divider comprising fixed and settable resistors 45, 46 connected across the output terminals 4, 5. The control circuit 41 is preferably based around an integrated circuit power regulator lC1 such as an LN305. The current and voltage representative signals are fed to the regulator IC1 at pins 1, 8 and 6 respectively. A capacitor 38 is connected between pins 6 and 7. The regulator is connected to the base of a transistor 47 via a series combination of a resistor 48 and capacitor 49 from pin 5 thereof and a resistor 54 from pin 2. A resistor 68 and a capacitor 69 are connected in series between the collector of tratlsistor 47 and pin 6 of the regulator.The regulator derives power at pin 3 from the winding 12a via a diode 75 decoupled by a capacitor 76. A resistor 77 is connected between the collector of transistor 47 and the common rail, and the signal developed across this resistor is used to control transistor 70 by being applied to the base thereof. It has been stated hereinabove that the requirement of the circuit arrangement is to provide a voltage sink effect on the.seconda y winding s of the transformer. In the circuit shown in Figure 10 this is achieved by providing a transistor common collector configuration which has the required impedance characteristics to provide a voltage sLnk. There is therefore no need to include a capacitor across the collector and emitter of transistor 70 as previously described. The control circuit 41 controls the conductance of transistor 70 and the voltage limit of the overswing voltage of transistor 20 is accordingly regulated in a similar manner to that described above. The voltage regulation of regulator IC1 is performed by sensing the voltage developec across resistor 45 and producing a related output at pin 2 of the regulator. This output voltage at pin 2 controls transistor 47 which acts as a polarity inverter to control the conductance of transistor 70. However the regulator IC1 includes a further feature particularly applicable to the described circuit in that current control is performed by monitoring the current flow through resistor 44 . This current flow will tend to be atiangular waveform, the pulse waveform derived from diodes 31, 32 having been integrated by the inductor 33. This waveform provides a particularly advantageous form of current control, as the wave form txianglar is compared within regulator IC1 with a reference threshold. As soon as the top part of the waveform exceeds the threshold, a limiting signal is fed to transistor 70, changing the overswing voltage limit within each cycle. This avoids problems of jitter about the threshold and spurious latching by controlling the current on a pulse by pulse basis rather than on an average current basis. The circuit of Figure 10 further includes an overvoltF e protection circuit 78 respcnsit to the voltage derived from a potential divider which consists of resistors 79, 81 connected in series across the output terminals 4, 5. This voltage is applied t n 2 of an such as an M 23 integrated circuit operational amplifier IC2 which receives power at pin 1 from the winding 12a via a diode 84 decoupled by a capacitor 87. The base of an n.p.n transistor 88 is connected via a resistor 89 to the common rail and via a resistor 91 to output pin 8 of the amplifier IC2. A series combination of resistor 92 and diode 93 connects pins 8 and 2, and a capacitor 94 is connected between pins 3, 4 and the common rail. Three like poled series connected diodes 95a, 95b, 95c are coupled between winding 12b and the collector of transistor 88. The protection circuit 78 operates to detect an overvoltage at the output by deriving a related voltage from the junction of resistors 79 and 81. If the voltage is sufficiently large, the amplifier IC2 activates transistor 88 which provides a conductive path for the voltage derived at winding 12b via the diodes 95a, b, c, thereby overriding the control provided by transistor 70 and control circuit 41 . The voltage at the collector of transistor 20 is thereby limited and the overvoltage condition at the output accordingly terminated. Further shown on Figure 10 is an auxiliary output winding 12c on the transformer 10. This may be used as illustrated to provide a second output which will be controlled in tandem with the remainder of the circuit but not regulated, since although tl.e pulses induced in winding 13c will be similar to those in winding 12a, they will have been produced in response to output conditions at terminals 4 and 5, not the corresponding output of winding 12c. The winding 12c is connected via diodes 131, 132 and inductor 133, connected as previously described with reference to ccmponents 31, 32 and 33, to a standard three terminal voltage regulator 134 such as one of the 7815 series. A capacitor 135 and resistor 136 are connected across the input and a capacitor 137 connected across the output of the regulator 134. The output at terminals 104, 105 is therefore controlled by the regulator 134 and not by the means previously described. Further similar auxiliary windings and associated rectifying and regulating circuits may be provided as required. The circuit of Figure 10 includes an improved starting and resetting arrangement in transistor 80 and associated components. Rather than rely on transformer saturation to turn off transistor 20, capacitor 86 is charged via resistor 85, transistor 80 turning on once capacitor 86 is sufficiently charged. This turns off transistor 20. Diode 90 connected across resistor 85 is rendered conductive when the base of transistor 80 becomes positive with respect to the potential at winding 13, i.e. when transistor 20 is turned off. The base voltage of transistor 80 is then reset to a negative voltage dependent on the overswing voltage limit on the collector of transistor 20 as set by the control circuit 41 . When transistor 20 turns on after transformer reset, capacitor 86 charges from this negative voltage via resistor 85 to a voltage approximately o.6v positive with respect to the emitter of transistor 80, whereupon transistor 80 turns on bringing an end to each switching cycle of transistor 20. A decrease in the overswing voltage limit will thus result in a decrease in the ON time and an increase in the OFF time, so that the circuit will operate at substantially constant frequency, but with a variable mark space ratio dependent on the load presented to the inverter. When the inverter is initially switched on and power is applied to terminals 1 and 2, capacitor 59 is uncharged and zener diode 57 isolates the base of transistor 20 preventing spurious and uncontrolled turn on of this transistor. Once capacitor 59 has charged via resistor 58 to a voltage in excess of the breakdown voltage of zener diode 57 plus the required base emitter potential of transistor 20, the transistorwill turn on and oscillation commences.Thereafter therectifying action of diode 62 discharges capacitor 59 and disconnects the starter circuit 58 and 59 by reverse biasing the zener diode 57. In the circuit of Figure 10, a number of diodes are shown connected in series chains, the effect of this being to match the forward potential drops across thePN junctions of the respective semiconductor combinations. The various embodiments described have included alternative arrangements of output windings on the transformer 10. It is possible to apply the overswing voltage limiting to a single output winding as shown inFigures 6, 8 and 9 or to use tapped or separate windings as shown in Figures 7 and 10. In the latter case, the windings are shown connected together at one end to provide a common rail at that point, but this interconnection is not essential. It is possible to use an electrically isolated winding connected to the limiting diode and control circuit which need not be directly connected to the power output winding 12a. This isolated winding can then be used to apply overswing voltage limiting which is electrically insulated from the power output circuit elements.
